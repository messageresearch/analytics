to present God's word but we're thankful with God for this privilege you're so kind and follow me in the scripture before presenting ourselves to god let's read two scriptures yes 46 verse 10. then we will proceed to James 4 6. is this morning our title is fighting for Peace fighting for peace poquito so now you're gonna fight for peace every inch of the way he said even usted to fight for every inch amen amen 46 10 says we still I know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth verse 11 the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refugees now he wants to be exalted he wants to be exalted when he wants he will fulfill it now follow me to James 4 verse will be reading seven and eight Santiago Capital James 4 8 says James 4 6 reads but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisted the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble so many ourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you now listen to verse 8 draw a night to God yes and He will draw night to you because Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded increment Heavenly Father we present ourselves on your people's ears and may we all benefits flow freely into Pueblo in your people Lord brother fighting for peace now in the scripture of Psalms 46 God asks us something God asks us to be still and there are truly things until you're at peace you cannot accomplish many things if you are running [Music] and they're driving 100 miles per hour and they're going super fast person cannot see the details next to him and simply see them but when a stoplight comes and stops then he can see his surroundings Squad police officer but when we're going too fast our focus is only forward but God is asking us so we can know who he is tells us in James if we are not calm and at peace God asked job one thing they're in job 37. let me say 37-14 he says this is and consider the wondrous works of God how could you consider the wonders of this world something is that will make us lose what we've obtained God asks us to become because God wants to show us something a credit Corazon and the message relief from the heart is one time he said we still know that I am God he says the church would only stand still long enough this is children right through it what if they turned around saying let's do it again Lord it wouldn't have happened certainly not wow wow [Music] questions falta for terminal what battle do you still need to finish says God simply made the sun set still under a few minutes to show you something Joshua says son stand still I'm gonna show you God was going to do something home but this is it wouldn't have done it God was going to do something he was going to give a witness to his power at his word he's Almighty and he's give a witness to it when Joshua was fighting this battle against these five rulers Joshua needed more time to win this battle and what he was missing was time what he was missing was time and Joshua asked God and said Son stay still amen amen now my question is and my question personally to me have we stayed still long enough for God's greatness manifest in us because God wants to manifest wants to show the world something God wants to show the world now everything is driven by laws in Islam the laws of gravity the transito the laws of traffic the laws in your home listen to those rules in our homes did you know there are rules or laws in church also God has laws amen amen [Music] or when you stop I need to stop yes water well he was tired sometimes we're very young and we don't get tired many things that day and he needed a time and he decided to rest how do I get close to God think about it how can I find my purpose in this life a Samaritan woman and she also stopped muchas she had a lot of things too many things on her mind she was not living the life she needed but she stopped to hear Jesus something's going to happen and don't says did you know you could listen to your own thoughts Padre [Music] [Music] it means stop and think pay attention about something Psalms 19 says who can understand his errors cleanse me thou me cleanse thou me from Secret faults because many times this life is fast verbios de me is servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgressions let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my strength and my redeemer Hermanos through life course as there are things cannot depend on dinosaurs that do not depends many things in a Christian walk that don't depend on us there are things that do depend on us something urgent for us there are things depending on us our life depends the lives are the ones the lives of our children depend on us and one of the things and meditate in our path this is [Music] Believe from the heart forgive me in Mary's belief is speaking of Joseph and Mary when Joseph told his wife he can say El esposo watched the husband made his wife meditate because the husband was meditating on God Jose is Joseph looked back to her must have said well my dear the prophet was speaking of the coming Messiah the hope of Israel and you know married we've looked forward to that one coming and when he comes out of the bondage of these rooms out of the bondage he will keep his word and Mary my dear generation if we don't see him in our generation he will surely be here but we'll look for him foreign the first Easter went cleopas and his unnamed friend in the Bible was they were going along the road discussing about him thinking on him yes every hope seemed like that they had was taken from them foreign are you a stranger is our courage weekend brethren foreign God bless you brother [Applause] we're going to be talking about uh fighting for peace you know uh it's it's just uh just a thought that's come to my mind you know the um our pastor he's been talking a lot about the war I saw Orlando muchos you know in the world uh withinro and uh you know we have to we have to learn how to fight you know at this moment right now uh Ukraine is is fighting for peace you know they're fighting with uh natural weapons but uh you know our Lord Jesus Christ he showed us how to fight without weapons without the natural weapons amen amen uh it reads like this leasi Luke 2 13 Lucas dostress and 14. it says and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men Gloria dios Para Con Los Hombres you know this scripture is usually used around Christmas but you know the scripture says that when Jesus was on his way it said you know he said glory to God in the highest glorious and on Earth peace you know at that moment and as a momento uh your peace my peace may pass had landed on Earth amen amen and that's what we fight foreign foreign already I don't need you to tell me what to do you know they're completely misunderstandings what is trying to be relayed to them so this is the way the people were with John Anton says he was not trying to he he never he never grabbed a weapon a physical weapon not in my face to go fight people but what happens is that in that time people didn't understand what he was trying to do so he had to he had to come with with force with spiritual force it was a spiritual awakening so that they could wake up and see the time they were living and not only see the time they were living but to see how they were living amen America there's a scripture in John 14 and Juan katorse verse 27. the word Jesus Jesus is about to leave his uh he he was he's about to leave in the physical form there and physical you know in his physical body he wants to leave them something John 14 27 says Jesus speaking to his disciples says please I live with you my peace I give unto you not is the world giving neither Let It Be Afraid amen amen you see uh when we talk about an inner Wars you know we talk about Ukraine fighting for peace you know the physical the natural is the type of the spiritual you see there has to be a uh there has to be a time where you fight oh for what you want amen amen and you see we all we all want something and we're all fighting foreign amen amen you see I wonder where we're at this morning where are you at in your life you see have you just have you just rolled over and just gave up you know he just walked away or are you ready to fight are you ready to fight for the peace of God amen amen you see a lot of the reasons the way the reason we act the way we do a lot of times because you see uh there's a war going on within internet and and when when you're losing the war inside it manifests itself in the external realm and El Mundo external you see there's people they say they got the peace of God and you know they could see a piece of trash in their house it just it just it upsets them to to see that and somebody else didn't do it or maybe you didn't Express Yourself the way that that or maybe the person that you're with Mary didn't Express themselves it upsets it makes you upset you see up that's not the peace of God that is not the peace of God and you just you're just manifesting what's happening you're losing the world but Jesus doesn't want you to lose the world the peace of God is it just needs to find a dwelling place that's what it needs you see the dove is a type of a sign of Peace what came on what Came Upon Jesus that's exactly what it was because it found a dwelling place but the father had given the son a perfect peace that's exactly what it was but you know but when we talk about you know Jesus says you know he says I give you my peace not as the world gives it because the world gives you a piece but it's only a temporary you know there's a lot of people you see if they want their kid to be quiet they give him the phone even the teenagers you want them to leave you alone just give my phone you see they don't need a phone what they need is Jesus that's exactly what they need you see but we just we just it's a substitute now you give them their phone and you try to take it away try to take it away from them and see what happens you know here's the thing about it I'm not gonna apologize for it because you know therefore they're more worried about losing their phones foreign amen amen this whole Christian work the Christian experience and this is what brother Branham says in the message Fellowship he says the Christian experience this La experiencia Cristiana is based suddenly in holy upon rest come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest he says you're tossed about with everything until you come to Christ then it's all finished yes resting in Christ perfect peace no matter what comes or goes nothing can touch us come over this comes over the shepherd amen amen and it says it says all things work for the goods amen amen that's when you have perfect peace you see how when you have that perfect peace there's nothing that can move you right now the external things has the environment around you can't it can't move you have perfect peace I want to talk about Jesus for a moment you see that was the time in his life when he had preached all he had preached all day no that was his business yes you know he came to preach the good news and you know he become tired in his physical form and and sufisika Su physical and uh he he goes in and he he gets in the ship now you know he said let's go to the other side he tells his disciples you know there's a great storm that rose up thank you you can't hold yourself together before you know you're screaming at everybody just screaming at everybody in your house just screaming at your co-workers you're yelling at your brother you know you're just you're just frustrated you see that is not perfect peace that is that's not peace at all amen amen it's just not no ass and the thing about it is these people were worried these disciples were worried but they had Jesus they would have just been like glory to God I've never seen anything like this before but Jesus is with me you see but they wake him up the boat is shaking yes you see he was so in connection with God that any storm that came his way couldn't move he was just so connected with God that's the external things all the trials everything that come his way he would just be like that's okay that's implemented I got peace you see that the peace that these disciples didn't have you see and I believe but that when we are with Jesus but when we I have that peace that we should be in the same way we should have that trust and the reason we don't know it's because there's no reconciliation I want to tell you peace only comes through reconciliation that's what the Bible says the peace only comes through reconciliation probably not no probably not I'm guessing you're not and um you know maybe like what they did no you didn't don't like yeah you don't like what they did uh hello whatever I'm not talking to you I didn't do anything wrong see that was you so if we said that you should come say sorry to me I'm right okay and you're wrong hey you even bring you even bring the word into it but the Bible says what you should do okay you should humble yourself that's exactly what you should do you see because you can't have peace unless there's reconciliation you see James chapter 4 verse 1 says this it says it says from whence comes Wars and fighting amongst you yeah hands even of your lust that war in your members you see it's the war's not out there how's the war's in here you see he wants to give you peace he wants to give you perfect you see I I didn't want to wait till the end to say this but I'm gonna have to okay it says the Hebrew word of Peace you know it means freedom from trouble and much more um freedom trouble and much more libertad problems it means experiencing the highest good experimentary enjoying the very best it means prosperity in the whitest sense especially prosperity in the spiritual sense of having a soul that blossoms and flourishes you see that's what peace is what he wants to give he wants to give you the best that he can give you you see when Jesus was here on Earth I want you to understand what he was going through the Journey that he took if he could only make it only make that Journey with the inner peace that's the only way he was able to do um foreign [Music] but I just remember as a young man not even as a young man I was probably about two three years old and uh you know I come from a broken home and and just like maybe many of us how many how many in here have been I've feel broken many times muchas amongst broken people estamos but you know one of the things that I just recall how was when the night time would come you know my father he drank a lot and uh and you know he I just knew that you know at night he was going to come maybe two three years old and uh and and I just knew well I just knew that I I would just be hearing things I was just new I would be hearing things you know at night you know but I'm in in my before I would go to sleep I just I would just be I would just you know I would just want to hear the door open you're okay because I I knew uh that after the door opened yeah I could get up and maybe uh do something for my mom maybe protector maybe stand up for her and you know sometimes I would oh this is Lucia and sometimes I couldn't and you know it's it's one of those things yes you know I I knew it was coming okay and uh you know there was there's just a war inside of you know I just remember that momentum uh because you know I just I think God was just allowed me to go through those things he allowed me to see violence in my home both physical and verbal physical but you know because he was preparing me for another War okay who's preparing me for a war you know that that we were all we would all be fighting maybe one day we'd understand that everything we went through all the inner struggles all the battles we've had that they haven't been invade okay it was a schooling of Jesus maybe one day you might see that what you went through the struggles and the pain the suffering the tiredness it was all for something it was all for somebody else yeah you may have seen violence like maybe you've been through pain and maybe you've been tired you know sometimes I get tired and you know sometimes I'm like I don't even know what to do sometimes but then I look at my kids I look at my look at the church but they were like less I look at the people and I gotta keep going I gotta keep fighting I can't give up even if they don't take me okay no matter this guy I just want I just wanted him to thank you I just want to make sure but it's enough that's enough it may not be enough for the people but I'm not here to please the surprise is all understandings that's what I desire that's why I wake up early like they said this morning the Perfection is here it's just finding somebody it's just finding a place that's what he wants he wants to find a place it's for him it's all for him God bless you [Music] yes [Music] who created [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
