uh right before ending my shift i started feeling light-headed my commencement mariado almost to a point where i was going to say i was going to back down tonight and uh i i'm still with that a little bit lightheaded right now mariago and then right now right before coming up it's like this is the day that he called me out to preach like i'm gonna get back and that bleeding stop amen so the party continues and the victory continues so god bless you all god bless our pastor pastor brother alex and every other pastor and body of christ that's over there in africa with them it's a privilege for me to speak tonight the word of god tonight along with my brother gustavo gustavo so i might ask you if we could please uh open up our bibles to genesis 25 federer verse 21 and 23. genesis 25 and it says like this it is see and i sagan treated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was entreated of him and rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to inquire of the lord and the lord and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elders shall serve the younger responders and we you father bless everyone here amen amen amen amen amen you may go ahead and take a seat brothers uh so we're still with the the bible characters yeah with the jacob and esau i know there's been two fridays with this with these characters uh so so we'll continue with them and as we read right now you know esau being the firstborn el canacio primero the bible describes him as a hunter a skilled man very manly and hairy salvage and jacob was the opposite jacob you know it says that he was a uh like a like a homebody he just dwelled in tents you know but the bible says as we read in verse 23 i believe that these two were already fighting in the womb and esau the firstborn el primogenito uh well he came out first obviously but the interesting thing here is that jacob while it says the bible says that jacob took out his hand from the womb and grabbed the esau's in other words esau was a favorite of isaac and jacob was the favorite of rebecca jacob how many have favorite kids here juantos preferridos the parents don't want to answer that right now but uh brother branham says so they said amano brandon in the in the message uh hearing recognizing and acting on the word of god it says like this this scene it says these two boys will notice if we all notice their nature and that same thing has took place all down through the age yes the carno and the spiritual carnal elo spiritual esau represent represented the man on the of the earth it never amen amen so we continue reading the bible or the story of of these two boys it says that esau came out came came from the field and he walked in on jacob making soup and then jacobs tells him i'll give you some in exchange of your birthright and uh isa replies yes i will contest what benefit does this birthright have for me kevin fischo professor and i believe esau didn't this despise of his birthright especially when he exchanged it for the stew because the that's when you're telling god you know esau gave up his blessings yes he gave up the blessings of god he at that moment and that's a moment he does not accept the things of the spirit of god they are full is foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually appraised his father anton says vasu father his father isaac and he tells him father blessed me no he was of an older age already he was already going blind he tells and he tells them bless me and he starts like who are you yes and that's when he he lies to him that jacob tells him i'm esau that's where he deceived him he likes to get a blessing and then isa comes right after him and he and isaac's all confused like who are you yes you know i heard her saying once once that it says oh i woke up today because my alarm woke me up it wasn't the alarm that woke up that's right it was god that and brother branham's preaching hearing recognizing his acting word of god he continues saying do you say mano branham and el nino recon jacob jacob the reason that he chose to find the birthright regardless didn't matter [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know it says that he was on his road he was after and he received this but back then they were only have bread for the priest and the law it said that only the priest could have that solo and david was there and he was hungry kept insisting i'm hungry and then god says because god does not ignore someone that you've been wanting for 10 years all it takes is it's having enough hunger brother branham i don't think i have this here but brother branham says mano branham this says that the natural man sees the natural things and the natural things are so contra contrary to the intellectual intellectual that he cannot understand it in there and it was you yeah it was you lord steadfast brother branham you know jacob fought with the angel jacob i know this later on in the story i want to get deep into that but in that moment jacob's life changed he was no longer jacob you know a moment tonight in the altar for you could change your life you talk to god if you come to god so no matter how broken you are tonight you know what matters is you having a relationship with god just one moment can change your life you know later on in the bible in exodus we read where uh where moses asked god he asked god is like why am i going to tell the the israelites israelis when they asked me who sent me and in god response you're going to tell them the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jesus but i want you to know but he didn't say the god of israel because this was after his name was even though he he was he he was the person he was okay god was still his god yo javier and that's me yes it's so young like god is not going to change who he is god is not going to not love me for what i'm doing you know god will always remain you know god loves the sinners you know god is the god of your process when god says or god says i am here when you fall i am there when you feel alone when you are broken and he will come down for you when you're in the pit yeah who knows you despite your mess-ups no important where we change [Applause] god bless you my brother john says god bless you more commerce making sure is of god and it's not a fake thing amen if we go to romans chapter nine romanos capitulo nueven chapter eleven versicolons god bless you all my brothers my sisters my friends miss amigos uh if i can just simply say this i love you all very much amen god says this for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to the election might stand not of works but of him that call it a sobriety it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated i want to really real quickly recap on brother fernando verse 23 of genesis and two manners of people shall be separated from thy and the one people shall be stronger than the other people he did not specify which one isa or jacob specifically now i want you guys to focus on that later on we're going to be coming back to that we look through the bible isaac and ishmael as well up to the point of abraham and locks like our brother fernando fernandez we have the story of esau and jacob estamos and historia uh last friday our brother uh gamalier and brother marshall el venez pasado el manoga malia and mano martial uh it was a confirmation i believe from god confirmation one quote or two quotes that brother gama and brother marshall said hermano and manoga malian mention i had already had yo prepared many times and when you read the the the story of eastern jacob who said i sort of jacob i don't know if you're like me no you ask yourself questions and it's good to ask yourself questions but the question the perfect elective of god that the author that descendants from abraham to isaac then came down to those two twins the only explanation i can give you like explicit and we're just going to recap on that again i can't review something enough okay it's always good to review what our prophet said what the word of god says when those times that god according to the elect might stand questions the very elect how from this descendant now he says no matter how good your father and mother was they said how much christian your father and mother was juan finos it still lays to you as an individual dependent you said come on before [Music] where we cannot already make up our mind as young people what we like what we don't like or if we can say our certain way of believing the question is the devil knows more what god has and hold for you el diablo yourself he does everything he can to take away do not continue the because like i said in the beginning as long as we're still here we're always going to be faced with evil adam in the beginning the devil if you want to obtain of that birthright to help you in that moment and that's a moment when the devil strikes you what you truly have inside of it something if i can say fake silo podes imaginary imaginario what what esau had if i could say look at esau again i'm gonna be quoting quite a bit of our prophets many preachers can quote a lot about a prophet what i'm trying to do is to bring it in the same manner same spirit that loving spirits are loving i love them which i have for you yes he says will we know in today that it's the law of contrast that weather is good there is evil brother marshall said this quote last friday brother says and we will never no matter what our environment may be now notice that church no important questions [Applause] is you have to take one side or the other side of the name of the lord god allows us to have that free will he gives us a choice and tonight he gives you still the choice because many times again the the story of isa and jacob it's i can say it's part of my life because when we look upon jacob and isaac both were very similar both were religious foreign both believed in god it wasn't that it said no he saw believed in uh had idols no no brother brandon even says esau was a better gentleman than jacob he took care of his blind daddy it's it may seem that he was a better christian if you could say no he was going out and taking care of his daddy's where jacob was home taking being with his mother brother brandon calls him a el amano branham lawyer my own many times i i'm i'm like that i question myself am i like jacob but here's the difference even though jacob and esau could never see he needed a change in his when it came upon him i'm going to go even deeper than that because many times young people as adults we have those genuine experiences so we receive the baptism of the holy spirit he says therefore god gives thee of the dew of the heaven from it's because once that touches down deep within your soul it's when only god is solo and only god can start working inside of you because no one else can go deep inside your mouth that in your my way that's what jacob [Music] [Applause] those but there's more spirits speeding they want to latch on to us punto i'm not saying this is going to happen from today or tomorrow so he said okay it's a process so like a brother wednesday that's when you know you're going like they said commodity if it were possible it would deceive the very elect that scripture comes heavy on my heart many times maybe through a preaching examine yourself through the words because there's nothing else help us get to that perfect stature that perfect statue of if we could solo how many years we've been going to church how many years we've been trying time and time again but like i said make sure not even 99.99 el correcto don't be deceived no saying as many times i've had friends amigos i've had brothers we've all heard the same preachings that's right some and i'm not saying how's that left i do believe that they will croquet is uh by the grace of god like brother fernando fernando but right now in my time i'm i'm still young i know that estoy haven't you lost but like our pastor pastor he says i like to ask myself serious questions questions that shake me foreign am i doing what you want am i doing your will to voluntarily am i doing my own time thinking it's your will [Music] justification i'm still here [Music] all right you're here okay but what are you gonna do while you're here are you gonna make a choice if you change up your life forever or do you want to continue living [Music] doing the same thing over and over and over struggling in the same battles struggling in the same temptations struggling in the same problems problems that's up to me what i want to [Applause] [Music] next to
