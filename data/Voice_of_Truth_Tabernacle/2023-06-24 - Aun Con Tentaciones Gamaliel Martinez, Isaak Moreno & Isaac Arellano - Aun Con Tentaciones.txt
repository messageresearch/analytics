between you come from isn't it one of isn't it one of your passions with fighting your members you curve covet and you don't have you kill and burn with envy and you can't reach foreign [Music] Brothers Elementary [Music] and I put I put because I can I can relate this to me being and uh from those and I believe I can identify with some of the uses this evening because I asked myself those questions I was born in the message and I I titled it is does God really exist was one of my questions because the youth asked themselves that question a lot csrc if that's so uh then who is he where is he is God truly interested in my life because I've been through there I was born in the message those questions came to me those questions really bring doubt Elias Elijah it was a person he was a prophet that was fearful there I imagine youth get includes and I include myself that we've gone through some of those ideas there are days where we're on the highs ideas and their days where we're on the Lord because we're humanos we are humans we are we will have highs and lows and and and Beyond The Heights as well and Don says do we all have highs and lows questions so youth Elijah but if you make a mistake characteristics um foreign similar to hours the Lord foreign foreign okay get out man God really heal me so he says here and so the mentors of questions when his temper slipped out of his hands and he had amenities that went wrong it's his Holiness because I am in him and that's what makes it real we don't have to depend on ourselves right right I like what it says in James chapter five uh um that does not that does not mean that God doesn't love you that God can't use you that does that doesn't mean to express London here are his songs which come from the sick and Afflicted this faith that we have been talking about um let's jump a little bit here okay they say is he prayed firmly so that it wouldn't rain if we see what the prophet says here he prayed and it wouldn't rain do you know this use he used Elijah even then [Music] [Music] our heavenly father says the word that the prayer of the faith will save the sick and the Elijah's passage similar to ours so I will go quickly to this this is God allows us to never be guilty of making the gospel so complicated so that people can come to think that it is a matter of men but of God now here I repeat once again the church from where I came from in Mexico in Mexico I never saw this in the United States but in Mexico they were very legally I see I see I see and like this is I don't want to be guilty to you foreign simply remembering my youth yeah they told me I don't know how to play the drums if you don't have a suit they would tell me I couldn't play this is Worship the Lord [Music] and I'll leave this spot for the last verse of the Bible here foreign to destroy through death the one who had the Empire of death that is the devil [Music] for as soon as he is he himself Lord Jesus Christ is with us he was a young man as well I'll leave you with that God bless you amen God bless you brothers and sisters how many came expecting something from God amen amen amen he's great amen amen I just want to say hi to the brothers and give them thanks for the trip that we took last time didn't have a chance to say something I just wanted to say that before we start amen amen our Lord is great amen is contraceptive and then um if you could go with me to First Kings 18 21 uh Reyes First Kings 18 21. amen everyone looks great tonight amen amen First Kings 18 21. and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long how e between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if thou then follow him and the people answered him not a word is you see our brother um gamma red um the verse with um Elijah being having passions as us right and like he said even with Temptations amen and as a subtitle I put what are you passionate about you see we see the people from measure at this time they had passions for the wrong things correct they had passion for everything except the truth you see we see that the nation um they didn't know if it was better to worship you see they knew Jehovah but they weren't passionate for him they have the truth amen you see we see Elijah came to bring the truth we see we see that gamma was talking a little bit about um you know Temptations and being passionate for the wrong things a little bit of the things that Elijah had you know he was depressed he was a man like us amen but I would like to speak a little bit about his passion but towards God Amen I want to bring it the other way around amen you see we see he had passion for God you see even with his mistakes and him and The Temptations he still had the passion he still prayed amen he still stopped the rain for three years and six months well he didn't do it but through his prayers amen and we see the most a man like him to come down to earth had to have passion to speak to so many people amen you see um what are you passionate for tonight amen what are your passions tonight amen what are your passions you see I can relate this a lot to you my passions uh one of my passions that I that I was really big ones with soccer amen amen I love to watch it I love to play it and if we read the the definition of passion it says strong and barely controllable emotions see when someone has passion for something it's almost to the point where you can't control it it's almost to the point where you have that itch amen and it could either be bad yeah he gave them the first option to show how great their God was amen you see he told them okay I'll let you see if fear God is the true God and they made their altars amen as we know and you know I believe they had the passion 450 prophets try to prove them wrong amen they had the passion so much to the point where they started to cut themselves and we see that Elijah Elias he started kind of making a little fun of them he was like where's your God he's like he might be sleeping he probably took a trip somewhere he says cry even louder to your God you see it says in First Kings 18 27 this is and it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is on a journey or perhaps and must be awakened you see their God media Studios he was not a real God Amen and they thought he was amen that yeah and like I read ikomolei it says Elijah said he said how long will Yeehaw between two opinions amen now I ask you tonight how long are you going to be going back and forth amen when are you gonna finally make your decision I mean amen because God is coming soon amen we don't have much more time we might think we're young we have all the time in the world Amen but that's what a lot of us think but time is getting shorter we have to make a decision amen amen and I would like to read this other scripture on John 2 17 and it says and his disciples remembered that it was written and tons is great energy or enthusiasm in pursuit of a cause for an objective amen I don't know I don't know what your zoo is where your enthusiasm is towards amen but I hope it stores the things of God Amen you see I don't know what is eating you up it's the zoo of the Lord or if it's the Zeal towards the world Amen you see if you have a Zeal that's lukewarm because that's mediocre okay that's all in vain amen you see we have to have a zoo that is 100 amen you see when we watch our favorite shows um we're doing our favorite things we're not living anything right amen when we're courting amen you see this is a big one for the Youth amen when you're recording you want to do the best you can say the best I can for whoever I'm courting with it and the women the same for the man amen you want to give it your eyes you have that passion towards it you had that zeal and if we could just have that towards the things of God will do the rest amen you will have to worry about what you have to do all you have to do is trust in him I know that you're giving them your hundred percent we're talking in our small groups and my dad was saying he gave a little example he said if brother Ben has a little bit of Faith because he's not going to expect more Brother Band or he's not going to expect what Diego has from brother Ben amen Expressway you have tonight give it your all amen if you could play an instrument Venus yeah sorry Brothers but sad because we don't realize how ungrateful we are sometimes we don't realize what God has given us amen how privileged we really are amen you see seeing our brother John there in his bed you see um I don't know if you guys went to go visit him you know but it's something great to see him back amen I don't know if he's here but amen it's a great American amen and I don't want to get to the point so where God has to put me in a position like that for me to realize what I can do for him for me to finally raise my hands amen amen for me to give him glory amen for you to realize what God could do to you amen well you could do for God Amen and I just want to read a quote real quick now what was the difference the whole country was rolling with these prophets but here's one man amen the reason that he knowed he was right and he come out he was right he was standing on the saith the Lord amen God's promise and he know that no matter how many preachers or how many denominations or how many kings and how many anything else said anything contrary to it God's word will prevail if he stands had to stand by himself with the whole nation against him but he stood there alone on the word of God knowing that God would keep his words because Elijah said when he cursed him there by the Lord and said the dogs will lick your blood because that evil thing you done how could that man turn around and predict blessings on there by a genuine prophetic he know nothing could happen but evil so he stayed on the word of God and he stood alone before the whole nation is preachers and doctors of uh around him and everything else he stood alone with God you see you sometimes we have to stand alone with God Amen you see it doesn't matter what others think amen you see what your friends think look you see a lot of people in the shop in a shop they ask me amen or I'll ask them usually first I'll ask them what are you doing this weekend you know they'll usually tell me oh we're gonna go to Denver or I'm having a barbecue taking a couple of drinks I'm gonna go smoke tonight and then they turn around and ask me amen they said what are you going to do this weekend and you know I used to be embarrassed to tell them amen I'm not gonna lie man I used to hide around the corner amen um you know it's shameful you know as you to do that amen I used to tell him you know I don't got nothing planned just be with the family amen I go to a park on Sunday amen Domingo go play some volleyball volleyball if you want to go you could go amen um but you know now when God works in your heart amen one tells them amen [Music] no I have you serious amen and we don't realize how much people are in need amen and when they hear that they're like you service they start asking you wait wait what's that yes the service we have specifically you're giving out the church information amen when that passion grows inside of you you know there's nothing that's going to stop you amen no embarrassment is going to stop you your friends aren't going to stop you if your friend doesn't raise your hands that's not going to stop you no boy because when God works in you you don't care amen you don't care to shout amen amen you don't care to raise your hand you don't care to stand up and give thanks to God Amen amen and before I close I would like to read one more um verse Corinthians amen God will never give you more than what you could handle amen when it says there hath no temptation taking hold of you but such as is common to man no owes us God is faithful he will not suffer you to be tempted beyond that which ye are able to Bear okay but with the Temptation will also make a way to escape that he may be able to Bear it amen how many give thanks to God no matter what you're going through tonight the way you will go through just know God knows amen but just know he made a way for an escape amen amen and before I give this spot to our brother Isaac I just want to say what are you passionate about uh are you going to be hot are you going to be cold amen or what's that for you we can't be looking vendiga Los Angeles God bless you Brothers it's amazing to see is that there's not an empty seat that means there's hunger for the word of God and this time it says that Israel in the Israel says there will be a drought for the word of God Amen amen yes that's right brother let's read first in James 5. our title tonight again is even with temptation is and James 5 reads verse 16 Juan capitulo we create everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it reads confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth mucho and the next verse says Elias was a man's subject to life passions as we are and he prayed earnestly Elias my focus tonight brother is the effectual fervent prayer Isla is and I have lived this in my life and um maybe tonight you'll see me shed a tear yeah but many times when we speak of a man like Elijah whichever is you would expect him to be a great Angel and I'm taking this from the message Elijah from brother Brandon 1953 he says or some sort of sainted person that was dropped out of heaven but the Bible said that he was a man's subject to life passions as we are um he has his ups and downs his trials his indifference but he prayed earnestly that it wouldn't rain now back to our where we find this uh saying fervent prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much the English word for fervent in English means and passion or forceful passionate heartfelt Corazon powerful or wholehearted [Music] and it seems to indicate so Indica that someone that is half-hearted okay that the prayer will not be as effective has anyone ever prayed that way and you feel God doesn't listen well thanks to God that there is a way to pray yeah he continues saying but God answered his prayer because he prayed earnestly and sincerely foreign how many times have we prayed outside of the will of God now I understand why why I don't receive the things we have a father that knows what's better for us God told Elijah it would rain so he prayed under God's Will and that was a fervent prayer now listen to this the reason that a prophet would pray that God would off the reins that it wouldn't rain a prophet starving the people to death could you imagine that a centered person a Godly Man a prophet major prophet one of the greatest in the Bible pray that God wouldn't even let it rain to bring food on the earth now listen to this understanding here for he knew it was a great mistake for the people to have plenty to eat and today lost and be lost in torments but then it says it would be better that they had nothing to eat it would be better if I had nothing to eat it would be better if you had nothing to eat and go to heaven amen amen says and that's true today what's the matter with we American people guess we're well fed and fattened up it's the most and we just think we got everything made and it's the same thing with Israel yes it got into a place in the rain and we forget where it comes from amen amen now I'm be closing now brother a draw for the word of God what about a drought for a miracle what about a trout to be free amen Amen brother Branham says why this won't happen says brother I tell you when a man's really getting hungry and thirsting for God he'll receive it the trouble of it is that the church is not hungry enough tonight for God it's the reason the holy spirit is not moving in church brother Brandon how does this healing foreign and so will it work tonight in a trout or anything else how many feel like you've been in a drought where you feel dry where you feel like you're about to break when you feel your heart is so hard but thanks to God brother that I was in those footstepsos and I had a mother and a church you neglesia and I'm so privileged to have you is that my mother was hungry enough and God wasn't gonna let her starve of America when she was praying for me when all of you were praying for me that's Esso was a fervent prayer and I owe my life to you because I shouldn't be here but you were hungry enough my mother was hungry and now you have to be hungry enough for whatever your need is hungry for your healing hungry for your family hungry for the word of God just like it says there would be a drought for the word of God it didn't matter what it is I knew it was going to happen I knew God was gonna make a way understand like you're about to die Brothers I don't know how to explain it like it's death in life yes between the wall and the swords like if it's the last resource but it's the best resource you know greater there's nothing traitor then a fervent prayer and effectual prayer and then this we have ministers we have brothers here and I believe are surrender to God you know a lot of us are suffering I'm one of them and I'm not ashamed because the heart the gospel that's what keeps me bubbling look at me brother Brandon says he came to a fountain and he asked it what makes you bubbles is it the deer that come and shrink said bury that commentary and if the phone could speak back it would say no brother there's a life running through me that's making me Bubbles and Romans 1 16 says my brother Isaac was talking about being ashamed is don't be ashamed don't be ashamed read this verse with me Romans 1 16. romanosis says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for I am not ashamed of the Christo for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth we've all been lost but it's been God's power it's been the gospel yes let's not be ashamed of the Gospel it's the power of God it's our power it's our power it belongs to us bow your heads I'll be praying heavenly father father Lord I ask you Lord Senor that you take every heart in control Lord
