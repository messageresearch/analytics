certainly a privilege to be able to share with you all I want to thank my pastor first and foremost for this opportunity if you can open your scriptures with me to the Book of Luke verse with an amen we can go ahead and read it amen and it reads like this but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John if we can bow our heads to pray dear God gracious Heavenly Father Lord we give you thanks father for another opportunity to be here Lord we just ask you speak to us tonight and that you just come Lord Jesus and just have your way with us in this service guide us father may we just be able to receive Words of Life this evening thank you Father we put the service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen we're going to be talking about a new character we're going to be speaking on John the Baptist now amen he was a tremendous man used by God and I believe that we can learn a lot from him amen amen um there was a brother in the back room that he said it'd be a good idea but to remind the youth that these Bible stories they're not just stories it's not just a fairy tale or just a history amen but these are brothers and sisters and they're people that we we can learn from amen amen amen so John the Baptist when you see John you see that John had two parents but John's father he was old as was his mother and you find that John's father was also a priest and in those times that was a great office to hold amen and The Story Goes that Zacharias went to go do his Priestly duties in the temple and he he's uh approached by an Angel Gabriel goes to Zacharias and he's given the the prophecy that John is to be his son amen but now I find this part interesting because although Zacharias being a priest when he was given the prophecy he doubted amen amen amen and the Bible says that he lived a righteous life amen and and because he doubted he was struck mute until the day that John was born amen amen in the in the way that I want to look at this tonight is that when we as Christians when we doubt God's word we we can't can't express ourselves freely about it I don't know if you guys have been able to experience that but when I read this it really touched me amen I don't know if you guys have had experience with that but when someone tries to talk to you about the word and and you can't really hold a conversation and sometimes a lot of times it's because you struggle to believe it a lot of times I like zaras what what he looked at was the difficulty he tried to understand God's plan amen amen but that's not we ought to just believe God's word I like what Charles Spurgeon says concerning this Carlos he says this he says if a good man was struck dumb because of his unbelief what will become of you who have no faith at all praise be to God if that doesn't speak to anyone that speaks to me amen so you see that from the beginning that John coming into the world it was a work of God even just leading up to John's birth there were a lot of obstacles in the way his parents were old his mother was Barren and his father struggled to believe amen amen so we see that John's life was filled with with obstacles from the beginning it was a struggle just for him to be born so I asked who who here is fighting to be born amen not too many of us amen and if we're not fighting to be born I don't know if you know this but in the story John was a stillborn amen so if you're not fighting to be born then you're a still born amen and you need to start fighting if you want your new birth amen amen praise be to God a lot of times the reason that we are stillborn or find ourselves in a stillborn condition or or find it hard to believe the word is because we look at the circumstances and it stops US it keeps us from going forward we base we base our faith based on what our natural eyes can see on our problems on our trials on our tests even our failures a lot of times amen amen but God didn't give us our circumstances to go by he gave us faith in amen and what is faith faith is the evidence of things hoped for and the convictions of things you can't see amen I want to share a quick testimony and I think it has a lot to do with this amen um while I was in school they told me I wasn't going to get hired anywhere because I didn't have this kind of license that that um that you need to get hired and throughout like it was constant they just told us oh if you don't have that license you're not going to get hired I'm like well I mean I guess I'm not getting hired amen and then uh I got home and I told my dad well I'm probably not GNA get hired and he told me just apply and he told me just quit looking at the negative and and just apply amen and uh well I applied and a week went by then two weeks went by and then it was two days ago three days ago I got a call for an interview so I was like oh well I mean doesn't hurt to try right so I went over there and I got to the interview and they were like telling me about the job like if I already had it they weren't interviewing me they were just almost like giving me the job so they didn't they didn't like really interview me was a thing so I was all right then and then yesterday I got the call that that I got the job amen but the crazy thing is this is that there was three of us from my school that got hired two of us two of them they had the license amen I didn't have the license but they said that they were going to help me get it maybe maybe it might not have been God but I believe it was God Amen I believe that God takes care of his children amen amen that I believe that no matter what people tell you in this life if you listen to that then you're going to stay a stillborn amen there's no life there amen but if you hear the name of Jesus because it wasn't until John heard the name of Jesus that there was life in that womb amen it went from Mary it went from Mary to Elizabeth Elizabeth and then from Elizabeth they went to John am Elizabeth so it just goes to show the power that is in the name of Jesus Amen I believe that when John heard the name of his cousin I believe that there was a life that was produced inside of him there was an identity amen because John's purpose was for him to till the soil for his cousin so I think that there he caught the Revelation he caught the purpose for his life amen and I believe that if we hear Jesus's voice today that we also can catch the purpose that God has for our lives amen don't let anybody tell you who you are don't let anybody tell you what you can do because remember it's never been us it's he that is in US amen amen the Bible says in first John chapter 4:4 it says year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen there is a greatness in every one of you you that has to come out if John he never did a miracle but he was the miracle and brother brandham says he says if you want to see a miracle you first have to be that Miracle amen so if John being just one man he was just one man and God used him in a mighty way that just gets me to think what if it was Samuel and heido if it was Melissa and Ruby if every one of these youth had the same experience as John and what kind of an impact would that have brothers they're still talking about John today they still talking about John today and he was one man Brothers there's no telling what God do if you just let yourself uh you just let him uh live in you amen if you just let him get his hands on you amen amen that's all I have can come forward God bless you amen I'm very happy to be in the house of the Lord amen I'm very proud of my brother had a good four months over there with him where we really had to grow up amen we didn't have our parents no more we didn't have someone to tell us to get up we had to wake up early too 5:50 at least every morning to get to school around 7:15 7:30 and you see we're talking about John now here and it's said and we titled this and his name was John you see Dale was talking a little bit about his parents and a little bit about John amen but I kind of want to get into a little bit more of what he was talking about when he was talking about how he how he was dead in the womb still you see I I I found this quote in experiences preaching in 1947 and it says and the first time that name was ever spoke by mortal lips went into the ears of a mortal a dead baby and the mother's and and the mother leaped for Joy question mark John the Baptist is that right question mark [Applause] again it was six months without life received life then as soon as these words come into her her babe leaped for joy and if it'll make a dead person leap for Joy what ought it do to one that's already alive you see what ought the name of Jesus got to do to someone say that again what the name of Jesus got to do to someone that is alive imagine a dead baby not even born dead in the womb you see a lot of the times we're dead here at church I speak for myself I've been there in the [Music] Pulpit wanting to raise my hand the bench yes go ahead wanting to raise my hands wanting to say Amen wanting to say hallelujah praise my God but too worried about what the person next to me is going to [Applause] think too worried about if I stand up and rejoice because God is working in me what is my brother next to me going to say what are the girls going to think amen a lot of the times we we we're just here because the girls here we're just here because after service I'm gonna talk to her a good conversation we're gonna talk about what we're going to do next week talk about anything you know you guys know and you know it's exciting it's something natural but that's not why we should be coming to the house of the Lord we should be coming to the house of the Lord to get a renewing in our life the Holy Ghost born [Applause] again you see I was um hearing something earlier today hold on my mouth's getting dry you see we came to have church today amen it's a little dead out there but it's okay we're still going to preach am you see I read something and it said you are being planted but you feel as if you are being buried you see there's no difference in the motion of planting something and bearing something see when you plant a seed you dig the dirt right and you put the dirt back on or the soil and when you bury someone you do the same thing you dig in the dirt you put them in there and you're done right but the difference is when you plant that seed that seed it dies right but not only does it die but not only does it have to die but once it's dead and it rots it comes to life those roots start going down into the soil right and you might not see what's happening you don't see what's happening under the dirt Elizabeth might have not know what was happening she didn't know what was going on her baby was dead that's all she knew right but she knew that there was life inside of her every single one of us have that seed have that life inside of us see you could either be a dead person buried into the ground or you could be a seed and you see as time passes that seed starts coming out into the outside amen and what are you going to show on the outside what kind of fruits are you going to portray amen amen I want to read another quote um and it's in the message as the eagle stirreth up her nest you know if a baby's born and it don't cry it don't it don't squ they don't do nothing that baby's dead that's what's wrong that's what's the matter with the church today we've got too many still born babies see a lot of us are dead a lot of us haven't come to life a lot of us haven't realized what what time we are living in we are living in the end time and it's just going to get harder and harder and if you don't surrender yourself if you don't give yourself it's just GNA get harder and harder if you don't try to put an effort into it into reading your Bible and so you know just five minutes is all it takes you see I you you read things here and there sometimes workout things pop up on my on my phone or one time I did a a quiz and at the end of the quiz it says as long as you do five minutes a day of exercise you still can get to your goal when you think about that they like five minutes of exercise I'm still going to get to my goal it doesn't sound possible it it sounds impossible but when you get five minutes just to the Lord everything's possible amen he could do so much in those five minutes of your life you change your life like that and I want to kind of get into when um John went into the desert you see the Wilderness is not a a comfortable place to be in see there's storms bushes um snakes wild animals going going right you see but that's where he was see he was in a comfortable place he wasn't at his home relaxing he wasn't even in a place like this we're privileged to have a place like this to have the pastor we have the ministers we have here he didn't even have that a nyear old out in the wilderness by himself imagine that and a 19yearold like me can't even be left alone because we don't know what he's going to do amen the nature of man when you don't have god you're worse than an animal amen the prophet says but you see he wasn't in a comfortable situation right he wasn't on his couch relaxing watching Netflix he wasn't connected to the Wi-Fi Wii he was prob in heat he was in heat eating Locust wildy you see and a lot of times we want to stay in our comfort zone we always want to be comfortable we don't want to be uncomfortable you see we're too busy connecting Ed to other people's lives on social media on our phones Sports instead of connected to Jesus amen we know more names of sports players we know more of people's lives than we know the name of Jesus you see what we know more of what someone else could do for us than what Jesus could do for us amen and you see to grow with God we have to go into uncomfortable situations you see John the Baptist when he was in this Wilderness all he was doing is getting prepared to bring the word to the people right to repent you see and a lot of times God wants to put us in that situation alone in the wilderness away from all all distractions from all friends even from your parents sometimes from your brothers everything because it's just a one-on-one with Jes with God he wants you he wants to put you through the test so you could grow but a lot of times we just want to stay comfortable you see the disciples when they went through the storm they were in an uncomfortable situation but that was the only way they were able to see what Jesus was able to do how he could liberate him from the storm and you see they weren't doing anything wrong either they were in God's Will and a lot of times we might be in God's will but he's going to put you in that storm in that Wilderness in those hard situations to show you what he could really do amen amen and you see a lot of times we're put in uncomfortable situations and we start to complain oh this is too hard you see being in school I wanted to quit a lot of the times not because I didn't like it I actually enjoyed it I wish I would have started it sooner as many of you know it was a quick decision but anyways it wasn't something that because it was something hard like not that I didn't want to do the job of course we had physical labor but was just when you go somewhere else it's something hard amen when you don't have your parents there and sorry Brothers but when you don't have them there or you don't have your pastor there and you finally realize what you had it's really hard amen it's you see we we had some brothers over there and they were of great help but it's not the same amen it's not the same to have your pastor by your side to be able to text him whenever and he be there for you or have your parents by your side and they be for there they be there for you or have the brothers that you love and they' be there for you amen it's not the same but we couldn't whine about it amen me and had to support each other through every single thing I had to support my brother you know I never thought I was going to have to not protect him because I know he could protect himself I never thought I was going to be in the in a place where people were bullying them amen and the sense away telling him why he doesn't drink or smoke and you know my brother's a little on the quieter side amen yeah he'll speak up when he has to but he usually kind of stays quiet and so it was nice to see him and me kind of be a big brother to him but not only be a big brother to him but have a younger brother next to me and protecting me as well amen but what I wanted to say is no matter how much you whine about these situations that you're so uncomfortable you see because a lot of times we get lazy now I'm sorry to say it but a lot of our youth are lazy and I'm I'm I'm saying I'm putting me in there as well I'm lazy as well we get lazy amen we don't want to work we want to just stay home and have our parents do everything for us we even get upset because they don't do things for us because they don't give us a phone because they don't give us money to go out they don't let us take the car out you see and we're whining about all these things but you see when you why no one's going to show up for you see the only one that's going to show up is going to be the devil and he's goingon to be laughing at you because you're gonna see how miserable you are how miserable of a Christian you are how miserable of a Christian you are see the only one that's going to be showing up to that wine party or that crybaby party whatever you want to name it you're going to have one guest that's going to be the devil amen that's the only guess you're going to have there no one likes cry babies you see when a baby starts crying what's the first thing usually parents do what's the first thing can a parent answer that see a lot of people either tell them to be quiet or now we have these we just say here and quiet some right but you don't want to hear the crying right no one likes cry babies you see youth it's time to grow up you see being over there we grew up a lot I believe and I might not be M more mature than most of you but what I do know is that we do have a lot to growing up to do and if we don't grow up soon we're just G to get lost amen if we don't mature if we don't stop with these kids these kid things that we have he's complaining he's hiding things these things that we do as kids because that's what we really are you know when we're doing those things when we're doing those things you see God is more concerned about your development than your comfort he not too concerned about how comfortable you are and I just want to leave you with this it's time to get into uncomfortable situations to grow more with God because if we don't you could pass brother because if you don't there's not going to be any success if you're in the same comfortable situ situation you see everyone already knows I play the base there's nothing surprising about that but when you see another born child of God people see the difference amen when you get out of your comfortable after your comfort zone you see when I see a a little kid or something when I see these kids Alden Abraham Abraham singing and ushering and raising their hands it makes one sad amen because we can't even do that as older people am even sometimes as adults as myself you see we can't even give our hearts to the Lord and that's why it says in the Bible amen you know children are they're easier to give their hearts to the Lord your heart as youth amen but I just want to say that brothers and I hope this helped you and it's just time to get out of our comfort zones to start doing something that we're not used to to get closer to him God bless [Applause] you and his name was John can you say it with me and his name was John amen what a tremendous man God bless you I wanted to greet the inlaw Eric God bless you amen amen John Juan now to start to think about John you can't avoid thinking about his parents I'm gonna go back a little bit of what my brother Isaac just said God is it matters to God your development if you're growing or not if you're alive or not because if we start to think if Elizabeth the mother of John had paid attention to all the voices outside to her own voice maybe saying there's no there's nothing going on inside of me he's not moving I believe that she may have given had an abortion and many of us have spiritual abortions here in church just because we don't see things moving the way we want it dead we think things in our life are are messed up and we think that it cannot be fixed but that's where you're wrong you may say I have failures I've done this and that I seem dead I look dead oh but if you can just listen one time to that name Jesus Christ only that name only that life can give you life once again don't listen to the outside voices the voices that say give up stop you've done enough you messed up enough you keep on messing up again and again abort abort it no sir but thanks be to God that Elizabeth didn't pay attention to those voices that said it if it wasn't for that Elizabeth stayed strong and stuck to the promise that the angel of God said to her and to Zariah oh we wouldn't have this great John what a great character amen a great example for us youth to show us it doesn't matter how old you are brother Bram says that John went into the Wilderness at nine years old amen and just again the importance of John needing to come on the scene because before John it had been over 400 years the prophet of God says until a true Prophet had came before all right the people's condition was so dark was so confused they were so needing of a voice in the wilderness and now think about your day how much we needed a voice to come to our time the voice of Elijah in our time to bring out our parents out of the denominations to bring out our parents out of the world and where we you and I youth can be where we're at right now it's a miracle of God that you and are here it's no coincidence how God brought your family working your mom or dad to bring you and me here a message that can only bring True Deliverance in our lives and a message that shows us what that name Jesus can do in us there a life again because if there's a life I would love to have would be like John's his life was already predestinated for him it was already planned out from the day when he was born even before he was born I don't know how many out there would like that I don't know about you I would like that where someone would tell me Gustavo this is your calling this is your purpose this is how you're going to do it and here is what's going to help you wouldn't you like that you can have that you can truly have that tonight because the same holy spirit that John had it's the same holy spirit that you and I have that guided John that guided that kept John in the wilderness and that's the crazy thing about [Music] it the crazy thing about it he was n years old Abraham can you please stand up abrah look at Abraham Abraham how old are you right there oh holy spirit guiding him to the Wilderness think about that church can you step into the picture right now can you get out of your comfort zone coming to a I just came for a Friday regular service I'm going to go home enjoy time with my family and I'm going to stay the same I don't want to stay the same I don't want to stay the same in this cruel dark Wilderness cuz it's so [Music] key what John had when he was born he was filled with the Holy Ghost and when he was in the wilderness brother brother brother Isaac said brother Bram says that a man without the holy spirit is worse than an animal what if John went into the Wilderness without the Holy Spirit what if you and I go into the world you and I go out of our houses out of our parents' eye view without the Holy Spirit ask yourself youth we would be worse than animals I recognize it first I'm the first one I know how much I need the holy spirit in my day because this world is so dark so confused and it's only been 58 years since the prophet of God has left imagine John's time so important so important it was for John to Listen and Obey and concentrate himself cuz con consecration separation brings Revelation I'm going to say it again consecration separation brings Revelation and and again you can't stop to think John's greatness didn't consist of a great Miracles he just brought a a message of repentance only softened up the ground but there was nothing if you can call it great to the human eye but it wasn't John it wasn't John it was what was in John to making him do what he was doing it was not John when he came out of the womb of his mother and it's no longer you and I when we allow the Holy Spirit come inside of us do you want that church you do you truly want it it's here for you cuz many many and thanks be to God for a message cuz there's too much of me and not enough of him I'm GNA there's a quote that brother bam there the resurrection of Lazarus this again this is so important church youth how important it is to have the Holy Spirit because many times the devil tries to trick us with an emotion instead of an a true experience with god brother bam says in the message the resurrection of Lazarus if can please put it up and he says and now notice what kind of baby was this to [Music] be out in the Wilderness at 9 years old and here's the key thing and [Music] staying if I was John after the first night I would have already ran home if John's experience was based on an emotion he would have never remained those 20 plus years in the wilderness alone if we base our Christian lives off of an emotion we're not going to last long here we're not we're going to start to listen to The Voice that tell us you've done this you've done the other you've Hur this person you've hurt that person I just see you messing up time and time again no I see you you're probably right you're probably 100% right I'm not perfect no one's perfect ISF but thanks be to God I don't base I'm not here based on those those things years ago I would have ran [Music] away thanks be to God that there's that voice in the back of my head saying I'm not done with you yet you're not done I still have something for you you may seem Dead Oh but once you hear my name Jesus then something's going to really happen I'm sick and tired of L feeling an emotion I'm s tired of just feeling a chill on my back I want something real I want something real like John had kept him in the wilderness holy kept them together kept them prepared because the Holy Spirit had to keep them prepared for what was to to come later on that's what God wants to do with us church he want to do with you wants to prepare you for later on we may not understand it now but our purpose is later on many other times it's coming the promise is it's been made it's just that we believe it that that promise is for us the Holy Ghost was sent for who the Holy Ghost was sent for who for me for you to do the works of God on this Earth because like a brother said like a brother said you may be you may be the only contact for someone of God you can be the closest thing the closest thing they see to God but many of us our hearts are full of Callis you know what a call is and I'm closing up it's a thick and hardened layer of skin a a Heart of Stone if you can say let's just go quickly to Ezekiel because how many have felt that they have a a Heart of Stone feel like you feel nothing I I I I've been cold for so long I feel like I've been dead for so long but listen to what Ezekiel say 3626 a new heart also will I give you I will give you a new spirit will I put within you now look at what is coming he he doesn't say I'm going to polish up the old Hearts he will say I will take away the Stony hearts out of your flesh and I will give you on an heart of Flesh a a promise that he will take that Heart of Stone and if you allow him to do it he will put a heart of Flesh a heart that pleases him to dwell in cuz that was the key that's the key he needs a heart of Flesh something soft something so sweet and kind it doesn't amaze me why it does not amaze me why he was able to use a nine-year-old kid and fill them up with the Holy Ghost I know I say that as a joke you know where it says only the when I say oh only the children will inherit the kingdom of heaven right don't right when many people say oh you act like a kid brother Gustavo I am a kid but I also many times some people forget how to have that type of Faith a kid has to Simply listen to The Voice not listen to your reasoning not listening to your doubt but simply listen simply listen to what God wants for you in your day please stand how important it is to have the Holy Ghost in our [Music] day how important it is to have that same reaction like John had when he heard the voice of the name [Music] Jesus I don't know if there's someone out there I've been there where you come service after service and it feels like the same thing again and again and again you feel like you haven't done much this [Music] week maybe you haven't done enough but you want to do something or maybe you've
