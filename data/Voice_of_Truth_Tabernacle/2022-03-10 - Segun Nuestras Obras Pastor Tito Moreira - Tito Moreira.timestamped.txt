[20:39] uh
[20:40] [Music]
[21:14] that we can be in god's house
[21:19] i know that god so has word for us
[21:23] god is still good
[21:25] god is still faithful
[21:28] if
[21:42] if we're
[22:09] first verse 23 then verse 26.
[22:13] 23 says
[22:29] and i will kill her children with death
[22:31] and all the churches shall know that i
[22:32] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[22:36] hearts and i will give unto every one of
[22:38] you according to your works
[22:44] now
[22:45] and i will give you unto everyone
[22:47] according to your words
[22:49] say god will give me yeah
[22:52] according to my works according to my
[22:54] words
[22:56] and now verse 26
[23:01] it says he that overcometh
[23:05] and then it has an and it
[23:29] to him i will give power over the
[23:31] nations
[23:32] let us pray
[23:34] father
[24:16] what you have for us but i still know
[24:19] what you're saying for this night
[24:22] in the name lord jesus christ amen amen
[24:26] you may be seated brother
[24:30] elves
[25:01] [Music]
[25:25] there's no end there
[25:30] says it only says well i give to eat of
[25:33] the tree of life
[25:38] of verse 11 the church age of smyrna
[25:51] shall not be heard of the second death
[25:54] verse
[26:08] him that overcometh will i give to eat
[26:10] of the hidden manner
[26:12] in chapter three
[26:15] i know we haven't gone over these other
[26:17] pages
[26:23] overcometh
[26:25] the same shall be clothed in white
[26:26] rainbows
[26:28] this is the churches of sardis
[26:32] and verse 12 of chapter three
[26:35] uh they say
[26:36] alchemy
[26:40] says him that overcometh will i make a
[26:42] pillar in the temple of my god
[26:47] in verse 21
[27:05] and read verse 26 one more time
[27:08] it's curious for me
[27:11] that it says and he that overcometh and
[27:15] see
[27:19] it's like if god is applying another
[27:20] requirement
[27:24] and this is making me think
[27:30] that god wants to reveal something else
[27:31] about overcoming
[28:00] you need to do
[28:14] now see what brother branham says in the
[28:16] message
[28:18] the marriage the marriage of the lamb
[28:25] we know that there is going to be a
[28:26] bride
[28:28] ikeva
[28:40] now he is referring to the scripture of
[28:42] revelation 19.
[28:46] [Music]
[28:52] marriage supper of the lamb is coming
[29:47] and we know that those that are going to
[29:48] make up that bride
[29:51] is going to be his church
[29:56] and they're going to appear before him
[29:58] without spot or wrinkles
[30:01] listen to this
[30:04] is very important for me
[30:16] and they have the material on earth now
[30:18] to make themselves ready all right
[30:34] we think
[31:01] we must come to recognize
[31:16] to
[31:44] it is the darkest scene jesus is the
[31:46] most difficult
[31:49] is the most deceiving
[31:51] but in this church
[31:57] more revelations
[32:40] god gave her the materials
[32:54] so she could have access
[32:59] but she half made herself ready
[33:05] now this is important i know we've heard
[33:06] it before
[33:22] is
[33:50] if the lord will take this evil spirit
[33:52] from me the tomat from drinking
[33:55] or from gambling
[33:57] or from lying
[33:58] or stealing
[34:01] i'll serve him
[34:05] [Music]
[34:20] i will serve you
[34:23] i've said that so many times
[34:30] today i was reading
[34:45] we keep making excuses many times
[34:51] that's why we keep being what we keep
[34:54] that's why the devil keeps beating
[34:58] that's why he keeps beating us
[35:00] keeps
[35:13] if the lord will take this evil spirit
[35:15] from me from drinking gambling lying
[35:16] stealing i'll serve him
[35:20] but that's up to you
[35:24] repeat that's up to you
[35:28] hello
[35:35] but when we read this it feels like it's
[35:37] not real
[35:39] it feels like it's impossible
[36:09] [Music]
[36:49] according to everyone uh
[37:47] that's right
[38:02] you will receive
[38:37] and he offered offering 10 cents
[38:43] i'm sure he gave a dollar i'm not sure
[38:52] and he was complaining
[38:55] oh i didn't like that services
[39:38] [Music]
[40:14] [Music]
[40:47] here
[41:05] it's by what we've invested in them
[41:12] there's something you have to do too
[41:14] says brother branham
[41:31] you have the power to do it
[41:48] [Music]
[42:00] you must be willing to surrender it
[42:04] i use that
[42:05] here's the problem
[42:09] we're not willing to surrender it
[42:12] is
[42:16] if we're willing we're willing for a
[42:17] couple minutes
[42:20] maybe a couple hours
[42:22] maybe a day or two yeah
[42:27] but we want to take it up again
[42:30] yes or yes brethren
[42:33] they continue saying
[42:36] she hath made herself
[42:38] i like that word
[42:55] and then say
[43:02] see what an overcomer he is
[43:05] brother branham says
[43:07] thank you
[43:09] what does it say
[43:24] middle of the paragraph
[43:33] you have nothing to overcome
[43:38] you through
[44:27] and let it go
[44:34] nuestro
[45:03] an application i wrote this on the app
[45:09] in the motivation group
[45:13] how the word joy
[45:15] grega j-o-y significa jesus primero
[45:18] means jesus first
[45:20] place others after joe altima and me and
[45:24] the end
[45:25] es
[45:27] that's the way to have joy yes
[45:44] you
[46:08] is made up of what you think your
[46:10] identity is
[46:23] who i think i am it says
[46:25] it's my ego okay
[46:39] there's people that feel that they're
[46:41] the smartest
[46:43] that they know more than everyone else
[46:47] the way that you see yourself
[46:50] that is your ego okay all right
[46:54] we all have a story of how we see
[46:56] ourselves
[46:58] now there are things
[47:02] things we use to identify or create this
[47:04] ego
[47:05] mucha gente there's many people us
[47:10] use their body to let themselves know
[47:12] who they are
[47:14] so they see themselves in the mirror
[47:18] you know
[47:19] yeah they see that they are good looking
[47:21] that they look
[48:18] clothing or
[48:35] why does someone buy brand instead of
[48:37] buying something similar
[48:39] it's the same thing
[48:42] it's the same amount of money
[48:46] it's not doing more than the others
[48:48] but they buy a product a brand name
[48:53] because that makes them feel there's
[48:54] something
[48:56] historia
[48:57] part of their own story
[48:59] materials these
[49:24] there's people that use their culture
[49:28] there's something
[49:33] [Music]
[49:56] i'm
[50:38] that makes me someone else
[50:41] this makes me someone great
[50:43] [Laughter]
[50:49] that's why tawa's always trying to be
[50:51] with me
[50:56] amigos friends suscriencias their
[50:59] beliefs
[51:04] their story where they come from what
[51:06] they've done their experiences
[51:11] because i'm full of experiences
[51:16] over and over
[51:20] because i did i already went through
[51:21] that
[51:25] your age your job
[51:29] how much money you have in your bank
[51:31] account
[51:33] this is all part of your story
[51:50] that's part of the story that you tell
[51:52] yourself
[51:54] this makes me someone
[51:59] i want to tell you because
[52:01] that it's all lies
[52:26] [Music]
[52:57] those things don't give us
[53:04] oh
[53:55] with being something
[54:01] normal
[54:02] normally
[54:06] it equals or substitutes
[54:10] having something
[54:12] with being something
[54:16] but you can have everything
[54:18] and not be anyone
[55:05] these things anymore
[55:06] [Music]
[55:11] it's always comparing
[55:17] always compares to everyone
[55:22] the son of god
[55:25] shouldn't have to compromise
[55:31] the purpose that no one else
[56:00] no one else
[56:12] is that it will never be satisfied
[56:56] i have it
[57:09] but the problem is
[57:24] it doesn't matter
[57:38] doesn't
[57:40] you can be the president of the united
[57:42] states but it will always want more
[57:44] elego
[57:47] more more fame
[57:49] more things
[57:51] recognition
[58:21] depending on the value that others have
[58:28] that's why it's always wanting approval
[58:30] from others
[58:34] it's always
[58:40] the more that people praise you the more
[58:42] people see you as a great person
[58:45] mass is
[58:47] the more that it is
[58:57] and the problem is that it's not true
[58:59] jesus christ jesus christ
[59:17] even his own disciples left him in the
[59:20] end
[59:21] he would be crucified
[59:25] if you are dependent
[59:28] if your value is depending
[59:44] we're not as good as the resilies
[59:51] i'm not as good as you think i am sir
[59:56] also not as bad as you think i am
[1:00:26] that i can be
[1:00:38] we're bound to these things
[1:01:06] that's why we don't let them go
[1:01:22] so i want to be wanted
[1:01:28] because that makes me feel like i'm
[1:01:30] someone or something
[1:01:34] and at the end it's all a lie
[1:01:52] that we've made up
[1:01:54] important
[1:01:55] at the end it won't matter
[1:02:02] who wants me
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:31] the musicians can come
[1:02:47] you need to be willing to lay down your
[1:02:49] ego
[1:02:50] your eyes
[1:02:53] what gives value to your life
[1:02:57] what makes you feel like someone or
[1:02:59] something
[1:03:57] how can i overcome
[1:04:07] there's a reward for overcomers
[1:04:12] and then he speaks to all the lilies

[1:04:21] if it's in you
[1:04:23] ha ha
[1:04:26] lay aside the mud and everything else
[1:04:31] and press towards the top
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:49] the problem is our ego
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:04:59] that's why god can't help us
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:20] no it doesn't
[1:05:22] [Music]
[1:05:33] in the end it won't matter
[1:05:36] [Music]
