[24:48] Lord
[24:49] he is worthy he deserves praise
[24:53] the fact that you're here tonight
[24:56] means a lot to him
[24:58] the fact that you made the decision to
[25:01] come here tonight
[25:03] it means a lot because you had an
[25:06] initiation
[25:08] you know even if your parents brought
[25:10] you um
[25:12] I feel like there was something inside
[25:14] of you that said I want to go to church
[25:15] today
[25:20] how many love him
[25:23] I want to think
[25:26] for the trust and
[25:30] um
[25:30] if we can please open our scriptures
[25:33] to the book of First Kings chapter 19.
[25:37] verse
[25:44] if when you have it if you can please
[25:45] say Amen
[25:51] and it reads like this
[25:52] so he got up and ate and drank
[25:55] strengthened by that food he traveled 40
[25:58] days and 40 nights until you reach Horeb
[26:01] the Mountain of God uh
[26:12] there he went into a cave and spent the
[26:15] night
[26:18] and I'll stop there your heavenly father
[26:21] we give you thanks Lord for giving us
[26:24] the privilege
[26:25] to be here once again Lord
[26:28] we know that we can always come into
[26:30] your house
[26:32] Lord and you know that everything is for
[26:35] a purpose
[26:37] Lord I asked you may know in my lips as
[26:39] well as my the preachers
[26:43] Lord may we grasp something from this
[26:47] Lord we ask you all this in the name of
[26:51] the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:55] now we're we're talking about Elijah
[26:58] you know we're finishing up with Elijah
[27:01] now is
[27:03] and so now coming towards the end of
[27:06] Elijah
[27:34] had failed say that again they had films
[27:38] you know and then here's Elijah
[27:42] you know heading into a cave
[27:48] you know how many of us sometimes like
[27:49] we hide in our little caves
[27:52] because in our lives we have caves that
[27:55] we hide we hide stuff from from others
[27:59] or we try to hide things from God
[28:03] let me tell you something you can't hide
[28:05] nothing from God
[28:07] there's not a single thing you can hide
[28:10] you know you may hide from you you may
[28:12] hide things from your parents
[28:14] from your brother your sister from your
[28:18] pastor but there's one person you cannot
[28:20] hide something
[28:23] and that is
[28:25] you know and as as I look into the
[28:28] definition of a cave definition
[28:31] you know one of the definitions a place
[28:33] providing privacy
[28:37] or seclusion from others
[28:41] now let me ask you tonight
[28:44] how many of you have a cave
[28:57] now the second
[29:00] um definition of a cave definition
[29:05] capitulate or submit Under Pressure
[29:10] you know and that's what the devil does
[29:12] yes
[29:13] you know he'll put you under pressure
[29:18] you know he'll put you under pressure to
[29:20] do things that you never thought you
[29:22] would do
[29:24] you know and then that takes you to a
[29:27] cave
[29:30] now the third definition that I have is
[29:34] a cave is a hollow space underground
[29:37] [Music]
[29:40] that's big enough for a person to walk
[29:43] or crawl into then now
[29:51] you know can sometimes be small and
[29:54] crampede
[29:57] comfortably you know and that's how
[29:58] sometimes we are yeah
[30:00] we have things in our life that we feel
[30:03] like we can't get rid of course
[30:06] you know
[30:09] but when you go into a cave
[30:13] you know the the devil paints it
[30:16] differently
[30:18] you know you know
[30:23] things will take you into that cave
[30:27] no depression anxiety whatever it is you
[30:33] know the person will take you things you
[30:34] never thought you would do
[30:37] or you know you're going to a cave
[30:40] of addiction
[30:43] you know it doesn't necessarily have to
[30:45] be an addiction of you know alcohol
[30:50] you know what if it was an addiction
[30:55] you know
[30:59] but the devil paints it
[31:02] you know oh look at this cave it's it's
[31:05] has flowers
[31:07] it has a disco ball in the middle
[31:09] of course
[31:12] you know and then you get you there has
[31:15] to be an attraction
[31:17] to go into that cave you know because
[31:21] something had to draw you into that cave
[31:23] in the first place
[31:26] you know and that's what happened with
[31:28] Elijah
[31:29] you know Elijah fell into such a
[31:31] depression
[31:33] you know that he thought that nobody was
[31:35] with him
[31:37] so he hides in a cave is
[31:44] so then I asked you again
[31:52] do you have a cave that others don't
[31:54] want to see
[31:58] like I said you can't hide nothing from
[32:01] God
[32:03] you know the author of Life
[32:06] the one who gave you life in the first
[32:08] place
[32:09] the one who has you here standing or
[32:12] sitting right here at this momento
[32:23] I like to read a quote from Brother
[32:25] Branham
[32:27] in the message
[32:31] he says look at Elijah Mirena when he
[32:35] called fire to heaven rain out of heaven
[32:37] and done the things that he did that day
[32:42] and when the spirit left him he was 40
[32:45] days and nights out in the wilderness
[32:50] God found him he pulled back in a cave
[32:59] personally for myself
[33:02] I wouldn't like for God to find me in a
[33:04] cave relax
[33:08] you know in my comfort zone
[33:11] you know because when I'm in my comfort
[33:14] zone
[33:15] you know I I don't read my Bible
[33:20] I don't listen to a message
[33:22] I don't have that conversation with god
[33:26] I don't have that prayer with him
[33:29] and that's how why sometimes we feel
[33:31] disconnected from God
[33:35] it's because in the first place
[33:37] we didn't give time to God
[33:41] and that's why we go into that cave
[33:46] because we've pushed him aside
[33:50] we've left them over there in a little
[33:52] corner
[33:57] you know so
[33:59] when we
[34:01] talk about a cave
[34:04] you know a cave
[34:06] it's dark
[34:11] you know brother Branham used to go into
[34:13] a cave
[34:15] you know he used to go pray
[34:18] you know so so that that takes me that
[34:21] there's different types of caves
[34:25] you know where you can have either an
[34:28] encounter with God
[34:30] or be held on to something
[34:35] that you don't want
[34:38] as an addiction or anything
[34:41] this is
[34:44] you know bad influences will take me to
[34:47] that cave Las malas influences
[34:51] the music will lead me to that cave
[34:56] not all the music just the bad news
[34:59] you know so so I think it's time to we
[35:02] that we reevaluate our lives
[35:09] you know because God is telling you
[35:11] tonight
[35:12] for I know the plans that I have for you
[35:17] declares the Lord
[35:19] plans to prosper you oh
[35:23] not to harm you no no plans to give you
[35:26] a hope and a future
[35:29] you know so a child of God should not
[35:31] fall into depression
[35:37] because he has God
[35:39] so if we have God in our side
[35:42] and we maintain that communication with
[35:45] him
[35:47] our prayer with him
[35:49] our time that we give him
[35:53] there's no need to fall into those
[35:56] things foreign
[36:23] a different
[36:24] plan for you
[36:27] you know but we like to have our own
[36:30] goals
[36:32] and it might not be what God wants
[36:36] and then sometimes we try to fight
[36:39] against the currents
[36:41] and we try to go against what God has
[36:44] for us
[36:49] but how why is it
[36:51] that we can't trust God more
[36:59] you know just just like Elijah
[37:03] something something I'll go something
[37:06] had to take him to that cave
[37:10] something had to take him to feel the
[37:12] way that it made him feel alcohol
[37:17] the pressure from the world
[37:36] Hallelujah
[37:45] now let me tell you something
[37:47] do eagles fly in caves
[37:54] Eagles can't fly in caves
[37:58] so if you're an eagle tonight
[38:04] so there's no need to see that to fall
[38:08] into that cave
[38:10] when you have God on your side
[38:28] God bless you Brothers
[38:37] so first things
[38:41] verse 9 is what we're reading tonight
[38:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:59] there and behold the word of the Lord
[39:01] came to him and he said unto him what do
[39:03] this thou hear Elijah El
[39:05] responded
[39:13] to saltares
[39:22] and he said I have been very jealous of
[39:25] the Lord God of hosts for the children
[39:26] have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down
[39:28] thine altars and signed thy prophets
[39:30] with the sword and I even I only left
[39:32] and left and they seek my life to take
[39:34] it away
[39:52] El telemoto and he said go forth and
[39:56] stand upon the mount before the Lord and
[39:57] behold the Lord passed by and a great
[40:00] strong wind rent the mountains and
[40:01] broken pieces of the rock before the
[40:02] Lord but the Lord was not in the wind
[40:04] and after the win an earthquake but the
[40:05] Lord was not in the earthquake
[40:07] delicado
[40:15] and after the earthquake of fire but the
[40:17] Laurels are in the fire and after the
[40:19] fire is still small voice
[40:22] [Music]
[40:31] and it was so when Elijah heard it that
[40:34] he wrapped his face and his Manton went
[40:36] out and stood in the entering in of the
[40:38] cave and behold there came a voice unto
[40:41] him and said what do is thou hear Elijah
[40:43] it may be seated
[41:03] because Elijah
[41:07] when Elijah
[41:28] that's why I asked where we left
[41:31] amen
[41:33] because Elijah had been on my screen
[41:36] mirrors
[41:40] I spoke to the heavens for the rain to
[41:43] come down or the fire sorry entonces
[41:59] and that's when we feel pressured
[42:05] we can be in under a great anointing
[42:07] right here
[42:13] but what about when we go home amen
[42:26] I mean it is
[42:41] and I've had those flings after I'd come
[42:44] out of a meeting it looked like I tired
[42:46] and preached and begged and persuaded
[42:47] and seen the angel of the Lord God sweep
[42:49] through the meeting and do signs and
[42:50] wonders
[43:02] and sit in a car on the outside and hear
[43:05] them cry say it was nothing but
[43:06] psychology there was nothing to it
[43:08] nothing to that that's all nonsense
[43:12] hey man I think many times
[43:16] what we come to see is the man
[43:19] and we don't see God
[43:28] he's going to come with everything I
[43:31] mean
[43:38] the great things don't make a lot of
[43:40] noise
[43:48] [Music]
[43:49] it doesn't make any noise
[43:52] God has done great things
[43:56] have you heard the sun come out with a
[43:58] lot of noise the great things don't make
[44:01] a lot of noise God works in Simplicity I
[44:05] mean amen
[44:13] oh then I called under the juniper tree
[44:16] crying Lord what did you why'd you let
[44:18] me do it foreign
[44:31] God knows your trials
[44:33] just know this
[44:36] he knows all about it
[44:40] so then he comes down
[44:45] again
[44:50] [Music]
[44:59] he's got to take his life
[45:08] and he gave him food and brother Brandon
[45:11] Says angels
[45:21] that sandwich or the piece of bread how
[45:24] what nutrients that piece of bread would
[45:26] have had
[45:27] he was able to walk for 40 days and so
[45:31] he got to the cave a Ming Amen
[45:34] brother Branham says
[45:38] sometimes
[45:40] as I did one time
[45:44] a pistol against my head
[45:48] to commit suicide
[45:51] but I couldn't do it I took my glove off
[45:55] to lay it on a high voice
[46:03] but I couldn't do it
[46:05] something still helped
[46:08] the same God that was with Elijah is
[46:11] that same God today
[46:14] he's seen me under the Juniper I mean
[46:17] amen

[46:48] there's work yet to be done
[46:51] something has to be done God wasn't
[46:54] finished

[50:00] is throwing its a quiver he was in that
[50:03] cave
[50:04] as using it as a refuse
[50:07] he got to that cave to use that as a
[50:10] refugee
[50:11] because they wanted to kill him
[50:14] where are we going tonight
[50:18] we have to go to the road
[50:20] because he was underneath
[50:26] taking shots
[50:28] and that's where God wants to go find

[51:35] verse 13 says
[51:38] they're in First Kings
[51:40] [Music]
[51:50] and it was so when Elijah heard it that
[51:52] he wrapped his face and his man's one
[51:53] went out and stood in the entering Inn
[51:55] of the cave unable
[52:01] and behold there came a voice unto him
[52:03] and said what doest thou hear Elijah
[52:07] Elijah running from his fears
[52:17] from not wanting to face his realities
[52:21] he gets into a cave
[52:26] circumstances to escape his circumstance
[52:30] what was happening to him
[52:34] he searches for a quick uh for a quick
[52:37] solution
[52:39] he goes and gets into a cave
[52:42] come on
[52:47] trying to evade
[52:50] what was going on around him
[52:54] not wanting to face
[52:58] what was actually happening within him
[53:02] it happens many times
[53:13] it affects who we are on the inside
[53:17] and sometimes what happens
[53:21] sometimes what happens outside
[53:25] whether or not we want to say what
[53:28] happens many times
[53:31] it affects my identity
[53:33] it affects who I am
[53:36] that's what I represent
[53:40] Elijah trying to flee
[53:44] he goes and gets into a cave
[53:48] but it's in that conditions
[53:53] sometimes we have to face our reality
[53:55] many times
[53:57] foreign
[55:01] around me
[55:09] when I turn the back my back on everyone
[55:16] who am I truly
[55:19] why do I feel this way
[55:22] why am I going to do what I'm going
[55:24] through and it's in those moments
[55:30] in our lives
[55:34] many times you don't need a
[55:38] revivals
[55:43] you
[55:46] need to be on the floor
[56:14] [Music]
[56:20] in the times when I'm alone
[56:31] you have to speak to ourselves
[56:35] and you and God just have to talk
[56:38] Lord who am I true
[57:03] Holy Spirit
[57:39] the answer sometimes doesn't come from
[57:42] outside
[57:46] says
[58:16] there came an earthquake outside that
[58:18] shook the cave where he was sitting
[58:24] there was a mighty rushing wind
[58:28] pagos there come Thunders and Lightnings
[58:33] for gives us more light on what the word
[58:35] of God God is saying
[58:39] all of it was God
[58:43] how many believe a prophet no distance
[58:50] all of that was God
[58:53] sometimes
[58:56] in the Thunders
[58:58] that is god
[59:01] brother Brandon says
[59:04] foreign
[59:22] foreign
[1:00:21] your mercy
[1:00:23] is the only reason I'm here Lord
[1:00:55] if I didn't know that God could do great
[1:00:57] things
[1:01:06] and many times he's not doing it in my
[1:01:08] life
[1:01:17] could do the impossible
[1:01:21] because I said Lord what about me
[1:01:26] what about me God
[1:01:29] is
[1:01:31] where my frustration comes
[1:01:33] because I know what God can do say look
[1:01:36] at your skin in capacity I know what
[1:01:38] God's capable
[1:01:55] but God isn't doing anything in my life
[1:02:30] that's right
[1:02:42] and he had rushing winds
[1:02:47] and said fire out of Heaven
[1:02:50] do you see Elijah's frustration
[1:02:54] of the things he knew God could do but
[1:02:57] he wasn't doing them in Elijah's life
[1:03:00] because sometimes
[1:03:03] is our frustration
[1:03:05] because we know
[1:03:07] they can do the imposters
[1:03:15] are you with me Church
[1:03:20] but he waited
[1:03:23] I like that
[1:03:25] but he waited
[1:03:32] and way down inside of him
[1:03:35] in his interior inside of him
[1:03:41] that voice did not come from the outside
[1:03:43] Church
[1:03:45] did not come from outside
[1:03:48] always came from inside
[1:04:11] when am I going to overcome this
[1:04:15] you hear a small voice
[1:04:18] from inside Hallelujah
[1:04:23] I like this
[1:04:26] is
[1:04:27] attracted
[1:04:31] there was something
[1:04:37] he has seen his power to do this
[1:04:47] God has done great things
[1:05:14] I want it in my life
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:22] what you can do through
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:27] it
[1:05:33] his power to do things but this time he
[1:05:35] felt his presence
[1:05:38] a long time in church yesterday
[1:05:41] we've been a long time in church yeah
[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:37] that he is there
[1:06:41] supresences his presence changes
[1:06:45] his presence changes everything no no no
[1:06:47] no no no no no no no
[1:06:49] I can't understand
[1:06:51] why Moses
[1:07:01] because I want to feel your pressure
[1:07:03] it's presence
[1:07:06] it's when you know
[1:07:08] and it's not a feeling this is
[1:07:21] I know he's there yes
[1:07:28] knowing that he's with us
[1:07:31] when he's with us is
[1:07:46] of my life
[1:08:19] in the cave
[1:08:22] have you seen a brother in the cave
[1:08:25] isolated
[1:08:29] he doesn't want a shaken ingredients
[1:08:32] that's fine Brothers
[1:08:34] you know what let me tell you
[1:08:37] that if you've been a long time in the
[1:08:39] case
[1:08:41] I think it's time to come out
[1:08:43] because your life
[1:08:45] it doesn't depend only on being in the
[1:08:48] cage
[1:08:50] the cave has its purpose
[1:09:12] I continue fighting
[1:09:16] right amen
[1:09:19] but this is
[1:09:27] a peaceful voice speaking to his heart
[1:09:31] so when the prophet raises up
[1:09:34] and comes out the door of the cave
[1:09:41] youth young lady brother sister
[1:09:46] what keeps you in the cave
[1:09:50] what calls us back
[1:09:54] with your complexes with your excuses
[1:10:04] that tells you
[1:10:07] know
[1:10:09] there's a greater reason for us being
[1:10:11] here
[1:10:12] foreign
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:11:01] I'm gonna feel happy
[1:11:05] I think
[1:11:07] from
[1:11:07] increasing to increasing increase to
[1:11:10] increase
[1:11:16] by faith Brothers
[1:11:26] so many empty benches
[1:11:31] Christ
[1:11:40] foreign
[1:12:09] we
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:15] don't have the numbers inside we have a
[1:12:18] lot of things inside of us
[1:12:21] but we haven't trans we haven't gave
[1:12:24] that to someone someone else transfer
[1:12:27] that to someone
[1:12:31] the reason why Elijah felt the way he
[1:12:34] felten
[1:12:36] was because he had to transfer something
[1:12:38] he had inside of it
[1:12:43] he had to do a great job
[1:12:46] and he had the empties
[1:12:50] the reasons why sometimes we feel sorry
[1:12:53] because we don't share what we have
[1:12:55] right that's right that's good
[1:13:00] sometimes I feel the way
[1:13:03] to someone and said to them you know
[1:13:07] what I want to speak to you of a prophet
[1:13:09] God said
[1:13:12] yes
[1:13:17] and that brings you happiness
[1:13:26] because it's a new life
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:14:24] we don't know the people that God is
[1:14:26] working with
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:55] how to make that transfer
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:03] out of the cave
[1:15:06] God sends into a field
[1:15:09] and there's where Elijah was
[1:15:13] God was already working with Elisha
[1:15:17] he was going to be the success and you
[1:15:21] know what
[1:15:22] he said yes
[1:15:25] the most faithful man Elijah
[1:15:32] Elijah had seen something in Elijah
[1:15:36] sometimes we don't see what God has
[1:15:38] given us
[1:15:43] inside of you
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:48] because
[1:15:50] of so many things
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:55] he found his Elisha
[1:16:00] is
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:07] but he gave him a double portion
[1:16:12] what a tremendous prophet is
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:29] he laughed because he had nothing else
[1:16:32] he had emptied himself
[1:16:36] of course there's a work for him to be
[1:16:38] done
[1:16:40] there's still many things to do
[1:16:45] the positive word for the bride
[1:16:52] I have that one is that word that came
[1:16:56] from Heaven is
[1:17:04] difficult times of my life
[1:17:09] that voice
[1:17:11] it gives me joy
[1:17:19] it's the voice of God
[1:17:25] sometimes the songs Don't calm me down
[1:17:28] sometimes it calms me down to hear the
[1:17:31] uh a message because it's the voice of
[1:17:35] God
[1:17:38] God bless you Brothers
[1:17:41] [Applause]
[1:17:47] [Music]
[1:17:57] may you please stand Brothers
[1:18:02] I believe the Lord is here in this night
