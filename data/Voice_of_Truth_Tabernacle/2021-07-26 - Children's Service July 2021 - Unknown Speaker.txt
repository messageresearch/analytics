depth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be lights and there was light and as god created the heavens and the earth boys and girls god also created men and women and like brother eliza just said right now they were super they had super powers real superheroes right and so one of them you guys want to know who the first super superhero of the bible was who was it raise your hand who knows [Music] [Applause] adam and eve that's right let's bring out adam adam wow well and as we know and as we know god created the heavens and the earth but he also created man and women also and the first one was adam as we know it and god gave adam you want to know what his superpower was his superpower was the spoken word he was able to tell a tree tree move tree move over here and the tree would move but also god gave him dominion upon all the animals of the land you're small you bark you don't bite you shall be named chihuahua you're big and hairy like brother i mean more than brother you're loud more than brother felix in the back room i shall name you lion and like i said god had adam's superpower was the spoken word being able to create to bring things into existence move things from one place to another how many are happy to know that god has real super powers has super real superheroes are you guys ready for one more who's ready who's ready well we got one more for you guys and the other one we know him back back years ago he was i'm going to give you a couple hints when he was a baby his mom put him in a basket down the river can you guys guess who he was moses that's right and we gave you moses i am the great moses i was born under the oppression and slavery of egypt my name means to draw out pharaoh tried to kill me once but god had a plan for me yes and i was he saved me from the hand of pharaoh and i was adopted by the pharaoh's daughter to be raised as an egyptian i then left egypt to to make my living as a humble shepherd and then i but then but then god called me in a in a burning bush and told me that i was to lead his people out of egypt i confronted pharaoh and he finally let god's people go but he changed his mind i then led israel into the red sea where there was no way across wow and boys or girls you want to know what his superpower was behind us was was pharaoh's army i then said to to israel here don't be afraid today you will see the salvation of the lord to the to the egyptians that you saw today you will never see again because the lord will fight for for you you need only to be still wow then i cried out to god to the lord asking him to help us and he said to me stretch out your staff and divide the waters [Music] [Applause] wow now who can guess whose moses superpower was can someone guess i had any guesses little boys and girls what was it died on the cross and he closed his eyes and it and he said it is finished yes amen amen hey man give you a round of applause good job but but moses superpower was being obedient to the word and many but many times boys and girls it takes a lot of power to obey right right when your mom tells you to pick up your toys help you help clean around the house or obeying your dad when he tells you you know help me clean clean the backyard you know it takes a lot of strength but god you know giving examples and real superheroes you know moses being obedient to the word now we have one more who's ready who's ready for one more you guys ready well i got one more now this man in particular there's a song about him you know and this man his superpower right now will know it he believed he had faith in god and that was his superpower do you can guess who it was who was it faithy that's right it was abraham but we forget also don't forget sarah also [Music] ten years later sarah sarah i i i i just i just spoke to god and and i i talked to her and and and he told me we we we we would bear a child and and he said he promised it to me huh god he told me he would have a child are you crazy i'm old i know you you are but i i i i don't know how or or that's not even physically possible but i i know he can do it i think you're insane and like i said boys and girls abraham's superpower was having faith in god and in his promise and as we know as the story goes god did something supernatural in abraham and sarah to bring forth that promise sarah your your hair it's it's it's not white and you you're not old and wrinkly and dead hey you you looked older have you been using my brother roger uses um i i found it yes i don't need this anymore i could go to horse tooth rock and this i i feel like brother jesus and i can run five miles [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's getting there it's getting there okay yeah yeah but praise the lord amen and as we can see boys and girls god's superpower being shown in abraham and sarah and as we know later on after like we said abraham keeping the faith and it took a lot of strength to believe that it took what to believe 25 years after that broad promised him he would have a son but he still believed and it takes a lot of power to believe you know something that seems impossible but god makes the impossible impossible possible amen now we got one more all right well let's see give me one second i can't see as i used to okay well this young fellow as we know him he was young you know he was the very last one the very small child you know many times they forgot about him but it's the ones that seem insignificant the ones that you may not think twice about that god loves to use the smallest ones you want to know who that was it was david david and he pleased god to use david david oh david one second we're having technical difficulties oh oh well oh so we're gonna turn off the lights real quick light lady thank you and then like i was saying david having the superpowers and believing in god that no matter what he was faced with he was able to endure all things and as it came to be like i said david being the youngest you know he was it says the word of god said that he was a man according to the heart of god believing that anything that he would face anything that would come into his life he would be able to do it with the help of god and one day he was faced with a great tremendous goliath [Music] i came here to defeat you in the name of the lord and i will feed your corpse to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the lands and david believing that the lord had promised him and he rather sling and slew showing his superpower [Applause] any crabs goliath sword and slayed the great giants lights off life's not too gruesome too gruesome again god showing his superpower you know david's who was a man according to the heart of god amen believing not doubting believing that god was with him no matter what and now now after a while now we've been talking about great men of god but god also used women amen and when we believe god used women as well women that also had great superpowers you know and now we're going to present one of many great women in the bible who is mary mary the mother of jesus who also had a great superpower and mary being the mother at the age of 14 or almost to be a mother just doing her daily things but believing that whatever came to pass would happen when the angel of the lord came to her angel of the lord mary mary it is i the angel the lord fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus the hell might this happen having known that i do not know man mary just believe believe okay i believe lord i believe and that was mary's superpower believing that despite not knowing a man she would conceive a son in whom his name is jesus amen it's okay baby jesus it's okay here he is the savior of the year and as we know many times it takes a lot of strength to believe you know believe things that may seem impossible but god like i said makes the impossible possible and as we know now we come to the greatest moment the greatest superhero of all times you guys want to know who that is jesus that's right
