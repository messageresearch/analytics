[26:18] genesis chapter 22
[26:21] how genesis and
[26:35] and it says like this
[26:39] and the angel of the lord called unto
[26:42] him out of heaven
[26:43] and said abraham
[26:45] abraham and he said here i am
[26:55] one more time please
[26:56] and the angel of the lord called unto
[26:58] him out of heaven and said abraham
[27:02] abraham and he said here i am
[27:12] and he said lay not thine hand upon the
[27:14] lad neither do anything unto him
[27:17] for
[27:19] for now i know that do do fear is god
[27:22] seeing who has now with you thy son thy
[27:24] only son from me
[27:44] amen
[27:45] may god bless his word i to be making a
[27:47] small prayer quest
[27:52] lord we are here tonight expecting
[27:54] something from you
[27:57] we are here looking for your blessings
[27:59] lord estamos
[28:02] we know that you have great blessings
[28:03] for us every day
[28:08] may you help us lord are you
[28:10] may you help us take something from
[28:12] tonight
[28:14] may you help us get leave rejoiced by
[28:17] your word
[28:21] i asked all this in the name of the lord
[28:23] jesus christ
[28:25] amen amen you could take your sea
[28:27] brothers
[28:30] uh i'll be speaking of
[28:32] abraham
[28:35] and the faith that abraham had
[28:38] you know abraham did not take a um
[28:41] a very easy way
[28:45] because he took god's way
[28:49] and god's way is not always easy
[28:53] god's way is not easy
[28:56] but it's the right way
[29:11] that he would give him a son
[29:14] and abraham waited a very long time
[29:18] abraham waited years of waiting
[29:21] and once the promise came to abraham
[29:31] god came to abraham and tell and told
[29:33] him to sacrifice his son
[29:37] what he loved the most
[30:05] imagine him uh carrying his son
[30:09] and now having to sacrifice his son
[30:12] that had to be something very hard for
[30:14] abraham
[30:16] abraham loved the obedience
[30:20] abraham knew that he abraham loved god
[30:23] more abrams
[30:27] and there was a blessing for the
[30:29] obedience
[30:33] god was testing abraham lost
[30:36] it is that he knew that he feared god
[30:40] and sometimes god wants to to see if we
[30:43] believe in him
[30:46] sometimes we believe in him only in good
[30:48] times
[31:10] [Music]
[31:44] we all have something to sacrifice
[31:48] it can be our time
[31:50] it could be
[31:51] our job
[31:53] it could be anything
[31:55] but there's something that we have to
[31:56] sacrifice
[32:57] and we all know what we have to let go
[32:58] of it
[33:00] you know some of us like to watch a lot
[33:02] of you know uh sports games
[33:06] and maybe that's what's taking our time
[33:20] that's when god brings his blessings
[33:35] asking us to figure it out
[33:50] a little bit in here
[33:53] abraham believed in god
[33:56] abraham believed in the promise that god
[33:58] gave him abram
[34:02] and it says that he was blessed it is
[34:32] it's
[34:46] for god's blessings
[35:06] [Music]
[35:14] god wants us to push a little bit more
[35:18] god wants us to put a little bit more
[35:20] effort
[35:23] a little bit more in him
[35:25] that is
[35:26] what god wants brother yes a location
[35:40] yes
[35:44] i believe that no one in the bible took
[35:46] an easy way
[35:49] that everyone chose god's way
[35:53] everyone chose the right way
[36:00] [Music]
[36:08] there's things we have to sacrifice
[36:14] a lot of the things bother us from
[36:16] getting closer to god
[36:20] and sometimes we don't understand
[36:22] what's happening
[36:36] we only see to a certain point
[36:54] and maybe the only thing you have to
[36:55] sacrifice is just one thing
[36:59] maybe that one thing is what's bothering
[37:00] you
[37:03] i'm getting closer to god
[37:06] god is helping you with that
[37:09] leaving you alone
[37:11] he will never leave us alone
[37:14] he's promised us that he wouldn't leave
[37:15] us alone
[37:18] and until this day we haven't been alone
[37:19] brothers yes
[37:33] because we all want to see our god
[37:34] remember
[38:07] but your true friend is always going to
[38:09] be there
[38:13] amen
[38:15] come on
