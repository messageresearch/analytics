[1:47:33] like you
[1:47:45] know
[1:47:53] Brothers
[1:48:12] yesterday the realtor called me uh
[1:48:16] the first thing he said is
[1:48:21] that we please not go to the properties
[1:48:32] and even asking if they can buy a house
[1:48:39] we're making them feel uncomfortable
[1:48:41] that we keep on going
[1:48:46] until it's been told to us
[1:48:56] especially because we don't want to get
[1:48:58] on their bad side
[1:49:00] looks like they might be accepting your
[1:49:02] offer
[1:49:03] is
[1:49:04] something to be happy about
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:12] um
[1:49:16] tomorrow they're going to be doing the
[1:49:17] contract uh
[1:49:20] today
[1:49:24] we don't want to shout Victory but it
[1:49:26] looks like tomorrow then we might be
[1:49:28] doing a contract
[1:49:31] that's the victory in itself
[1:49:34] um
[1:49:38] now we're going to be having the next
[1:49:39] challenge
[1:49:44] which is to come up with the funds
[1:49:49] it's not a small challenge
[1:49:55] sometimes the devil wants to scare me a
[1:49:58] little bit
[1:50:00] but you know there's no reason to be
[1:50:02] afraid
[1:50:05] he will provide yes
[1:50:16] but we need to gather up 154 000.
[1:50:21] thanks Billy God it's only 20
[1:50:24] um foreign
[1:50:48] Trenta and we have about 30.
[1:50:54] there's a lot of younger children and
[1:50:56] women that don't work
[1:51:01] so that's about five thousand by 30.
[1:51:06] that's a challenge
[1:51:09] how many of you think we can do it
[1:51:36] he never said it was going to be easy
[1:51:38] right
[1:51:59] are you with me Brothers
[1:52:01] and on this
[1:52:03] um

[1:52:10] um
[1:52:12] some papers and forms um
[1:52:31] we want to know if we're close
[1:52:36] I believe God designed this test for us
[1:52:41] to prove our limits
[1:52:45] there's not going to be anything
[1:52:48] it will be a sacrifice for all of us
[1:52:52] and it requires from everybody
[1:52:55] because if not all of us give our best
[1:52:59] continue here waiting
[1:53:07] but like God told Esther
