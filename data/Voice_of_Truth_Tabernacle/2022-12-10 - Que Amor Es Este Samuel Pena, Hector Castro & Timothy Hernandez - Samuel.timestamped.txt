[24:53] from the the message that I would like
[24:56] to speak today
[24:58] title is what is this love yo siento
[25:01] kids
[25:03] it is something you think about
[25:10] because what is This Love that God has
[25:13] for us
[25:16] let us read a scripture
[25:19] says John 3 16.
[25:24] when you have it you may say Amen
[25:30] this is
[25:41] for God so loved the world that he gave
[25:45] his only begotten son
[25:47] that whoever believeth in him shall not
[25:50] perish but have he everlasting life
[25:54] uh you may be seated brethren
[25:59] I believe
[26:02] that God wants to come down here where
[26:05] where we at now
[26:09] is for that to happen
[26:13] we have to create an atmosphere where he
[26:16] can come down and move
[26:20] if you come with problems or things
[26:24] give it to him give it to him
[26:37] smile to your brother or sister besides
[26:40] you and give them a a nice little smile
[26:45] we should be happy
[26:48] our pastor just preached to us
[26:51] there is no reason for you to be sad no
[26:55] I purchase there's no reason to be sad
[26:59] we have a great love okay which is our
[27:04] Lord okay
[27:09] would like to start speaking a little
[27:11] bit of what God has been dealing with me
[27:16] God works different with every in each
[27:20] other
[27:22] well with me he's been working this way
[27:27] Familia my family
[27:30] we weren't a very loving family in ton
[27:34] says so
[27:41] Pastor will go or our brothers will go
[27:43] go and visit there in Napa uh pastoras
[27:49] our pastor used to tell us or tell me
[27:52] brother Samuel I love you
[27:56] buenos dias and for me it was like he
[28:00] was actually just telling me good
[28:02] morning
[28:06] I couldn't really understand the word I
[28:08] love you
[28:10] for me it was something normal something
[28:13] common
[28:16] but God
[28:18] on me
[28:19] is
[28:20] that love is
[28:25] God using him for us
[28:28] and I've seen that
[28:32] that love
[28:35] it can only be the love the love of God
[28:45] I've seen it in my wife
[28:48] foreign
[29:21] good and he's always showing himself
[29:25] if you can't really
[29:29] release
[29:36] and now I understand it
[29:40] but I really couldn't
[29:42] understand it
[29:44] now I see it
[29:48] I would like to read a quote
[29:52] so we can understand a little bit more
[29:55] the love of God
[29:59] this message is the cruelty of sin
[30:03] preach in 1953
[30:06] these entrances puedo imaginarme
[30:12] so there I can imagine
[30:16] seeing that poor little Eve Miranda
[30:20] see in or looking at adamio
[30:26] her long blonde hair hanging down her
[30:31] back
[30:33] uh they were hanging down her back
[30:40] those big bright blue eyes yes
[30:45] they look like these guys
[30:50] where God had made them
[30:54] is
[30:58] the tears pouring down mixing with the
[31:03] blood of the garments
[31:08] and flapping down around her body Eva
[31:13] this is
[31:25] her
[31:26] [Music]
[31:28] his
[31:30] is
[31:38] and there the tears mingling falling as
[31:42] it run through the
[31:44] uh cheek skins
[31:50] blood dripping down blood all right now
[31:58] says you have to depart
[32:01] of my presence
[32:06] I can see Eve and Adam
[32:11] with their arms around one another
[32:17] going moving out like this yes
[32:24] then all cheekskins flopping against
[32:28] their legs bloody
[32:34] on their legs and tons
[32:37] then I can see all that space
[32:41] which was God
[32:46] is
[32:48] God has no beginning of days ending of
[32:53] years
[32:55] he's forever and forever
[33:01] I can see all the Great Space be
[33:04] beginning to move together like this is
[33:09] moving down to Eternal chair like that
[33:13] ibajo
[33:15] and then it moved right down
[33:20] as he began to the eye and Little Couple
[33:24] going down
[33:25] the garden and of Eve
[33:31] Les
[33:36] bloody skins dropping against their legs
[33:41] he couldn't spell
[33:45] and yo
[33:50] he couldn't stand it and it moved down
[33:53] and it moved down
[33:57] Trio
[33:58] and then he spelled amor
[34:02] l-o-v-o love yours
[34:07] God so loved
[34:09] else
[34:11] he just couldn't see them go
[34:16] that's how the love of God is
[34:20] great
[34:24] we have something so great that I hope
[34:26] that we can understand
[34:29] I could just imagine Eve crying
[34:35] she was something she was crying with a
[34:39] big burden in her heart something
[34:41] bitterness
[34:49] youth I remember in one of my hard times
[34:54] you guys have to be ready
[34:58] because the devil will come against you
[35:00] with everything he has
[35:05] and remember this one time our Brethren
[35:08] went to visit us in Napa
[35:12] [Music]
[35:14] I thought I had it all
[35:20] I told myself I'm good with God I
[35:23] believe I'm okay
[35:28] then a trial came uh before me one of
[35:31] the biggest trial of uh ever faced
[35:36] one of my biggest mistakes
[35:43] sometimes you tell your brother your dad
[35:46] or your mother
[35:48] I promise you I will not
[35:51] let you down
[35:57] but when you're when you truly tell God
[36:01] I will not let you down
[36:04] and you let him down foreign
[36:15] [Music]
[36:50] the same thing happened to me I was lost
[36:54] I was lost in this situation
[36:59] I was looking for God foreign
[37:07] departed for me
[37:10] just like he told them
[37:13] that they had to be departed from his
[37:17] presence
[37:18] I also departed from his presence
[37:22] but Brethren or India nowadays
[37:27] he has shown me his love one more time
[37:32] I've seen it
[37:34] I've seen it
[37:37] I could probably say I've also touched
[37:41] it
[37:45] just like God couldn't see them departed
[37:48] from Eden
[37:53] I believe he suffers when he sees us
[37:58] he paid a very great price
[38:03] I I wanna imagine it this way uh
[38:09] for a lot of days I've been thinking
[38:12] about it and I can imagine it this way
[38:17] I I kind of see it and place it like the
[38:20] devil's in one side
[38:22] and God is in the other side
[38:27] both are looking the things that we're
[38:30] going through here on Earth
[38:33] the devil's trying us for us to fight
[38:37] idios mirando and God watching is
[38:40] implemented and simply saying
[38:43] let them go
[38:47] they are my children
[38:49] no no no
[38:52] the devil says no no no I'm gonna try
[38:55] que Los Padres that the parents
[38:59] well hate their children
[39:04] and the children hate their parents
[39:09] I'm gonna try to do evil things with
[39:12] them
[39:15] in the heart of God has been said
[39:19] let them go
[39:21] they are my children
[39:24] leave them alone no chaos
[39:37] Anton says
[39:41] and they're arguing the devil says
[39:44] and God's response what do you want then
[39:51] ask me what do you want the devil
[39:55] responds
[39:56] there's one thing I would like
[39:59] quiero to Sangre I want your blood
[40:04] and this love
[40:07] that God has towards us
[40:13] he it made him it's okay it'll be my
[40:17] blood
[40:20] even though the devil will tell God
[40:23] they're gonna spit on you you're gonna
[40:26] turn the back on you
[40:30] they will spit on you and do do bad
[40:33] things
[40:35] but the decision of God was
[40:45] the devil was telling him
[40:48] the devil was telling them
[40:50] that we were going to turn our backs
[40:54] and we have because with our attitudes
[40:58] he was saying the truth
[41:01] but to a certain point
[41:24] that he's coming back for you
[41:29] just like you feel lost
[41:51] and take care of yourself
[41:54] thank you and God bless you
[41:57] [Applause]
[42:02] foreign
[42:13] [Music]
[42:30] we have to come too
[42:33] you're the word of God to feed ourselves
[42:40] because the word of God is food for us
[42:42] this is
[42:50] from the mouth of God
[42:53] when we come to this place Brothers
[43:07] I'm gonna
[43:53] and I struggled very much with the
[43:55] message
[43:56] in various times Brothers
[44:30] [Music]
[44:46] and you have chicken tiene
[44:50] foreign

[45:18] because he already died for us
[45:21] many times
[45:23] we say well I just don't know how to
[45:25] pray Brothers
[45:31] I've done it as well

[47:48] if we say we'll go into the city the
[47:50] famine is there and we will die if we

[1:01:23] verse of John 4 9 says like this

[1:01:35] I want you to make it personal
[1:01:39] in this God showed his love foreign for
[1:01:43] you and
[1:01:47] he sent his own and only son into the
[1:01:50] world
[1:01:52] that we might live through him this is
[1:01:56] love
[1:02:00] knowing
[1:02:02] not that we loved God
[1:02:05] Hernandez not that Timothy Hernandez
[1:02:09] love God look at Jacob not that Jacob
[1:02:13] loved God
[1:02:18] he loved us
[1:02:21] and send his son
[1:02:26] as an atoming sacrifice for our sins
[1:02:41] he knew you were you'd be here in this
[1:02:44] moment

[1:03:33] Gloria he is the king of glory
[1:03:37] he's the king of kings the Lord of lords
[1:03:40] now that is my King David
[1:03:46] says that the heavens declare the glory
[1:03:49] of God
[1:03:51] and the firmament showed his hand handed
[1:03:55] work
[1:03:59] no means of measure can Define his

[1:04:11] telescope can bring into busy um
[1:04:16] visible that count his shirtless Supply

[1:04:58] civilization he is the centerpiece of
[1:05:00] civilization

[1:05:49] so powerful
[1:05:54] that he shows himself through us every
[1:05:58] day
[1:05:59] now God
[1:06:02] he does a lot for us
[1:06:07] but the question is what do we do for
[1:06:09] God
[1:06:12] ask yourself that question tonight
[1:06:18] God has been for you
[1:06:22] all the days of your life
[1:06:25] and how many times ourselves
[1:06:29] we put them aside
[1:06:34] we put God in a corner
[1:06:38] and we forgot about him we forget about
[1:06:41] him
[1:06:44] we forget who is God
[1:06:49] we forget what God is able to do
[1:06:56] God loves us church
[1:07:00] God loves each and every one of them
[1:07:03] God has not Forsaken and he will never
[1:07:07] forsaken you
[1:07:13] our God
[1:07:16] medios my God
[1:07:23] he is a God
[1:07:28] undescribable
[1:07:30] all right
[1:07:32] now I reflect in my own life
[1:07:39] and I start thinking how many times
[1:07:43] God always
[1:07:47] has taken me out on the US dollar from
[1:07:51] where I've been
[1:07:52] and I know a lot of us
[1:07:56] we could say the same thing
[1:07:59] we can say that God
[1:08:01] he has taken me out
[1:08:04] of my problems of my sicknesses
[1:08:11] of whatever life throws at me
[1:08:17] God has never forsaken
[1:08:23] his people
[1:08:27] but sometimes
[1:08:32] and Amigos we become enemies
[1:08:37] of the crossed
[1:08:39] of Christ
[1:08:42] sometimes we become enemies
[1:08:46] of the Cross of Christ
[1:08:50] but even though
[1:08:52] even then even then I want to say Cristo
[1:08:55] even though even then Christ
[1:08:58] he's still loving us
[1:09:01] even then Christ
[1:09:04] opportunity is still giving us another
[1:09:06] chance
[1:09:08] every day
[1:09:13] to give another step
[1:09:17] man
[1:09:19] the musicians can come forth
[1:09:28] brother Branham
[1:09:33] it says like this
[1:09:38] and the only way he could do era
[1:09:42] was to send Christ proposition
[1:09:52] he might come the prophet speciation of
[1:09:56] our sinsidos
[1:10:01] for that those who had been elected
[1:10:07] he could come bring to him in glory
[1:10:16] could you imagine God running his office
[1:10:19] so loosely
[1:10:27] well maybe someone will think really sad
[1:10:30] about me
[1:10:33] maybe they'll come and get saved

[1:10:42] to do nothing
