[26:29] foreign
[26:38] foreign
[26:40] [Music]
[27:41] one body one flesh
[27:46] and this evening and this morning
[27:50] I want to ask
[27:52] who will I ask
[27:54] Ed
[27:54] [Music]
[27:56] to give up this young lady
[28:01] to be the wife of this man
[28:05] amazing failure foreign
[28:18] everything
[28:26] one momentum the moment has come
[28:29] for our brother Roger so let go of his
[28:33] daughter
[28:35] everyone may take their seats
[28:43] looking towards each other
[28:45] yeah
[28:50] the most contentos we're happy it's a
[28:53] wedding yes
[28:56] wedding is special
[28:59] every wedding is unique every couple is
[29:03] unique
[29:04] every relationship is different
[29:09] and in every wedding
[29:12] normally I like to ask the group
[29:16] a little bit of the history
[29:20] and why they decided to get married
[29:24] to get married with that person in
[29:27] particular
[29:28] Christina
[29:29] uh
[29:33] when I asked her what did you decide to
[29:36] marry Isaac she said
[29:39] he is my true best friend
[29:44] and I feel stronger together with him
[29:51] I believe it was all God's plan
[29:58] how our lives unfolded and how we grew
[30:01] as an individual
[30:03] S
[30:07] I believe God knew what I needed
[30:11] and he placed Isaac in my life
[30:16] for as a friend
[30:18] it is
[30:27] that comes and support one another in
[30:30] anything that comes
[30:33] [Music]
[30:35] anything else in this life
[30:37] you know that this is God
[30:43] forgive me because I know all of this is
[30:48] putting us together like a puzzle piece
[30:52] okay
[32:20] I come to realize
[32:24] God wants that marriage
[32:33] Persona simply be better people
[32:37] not all marriages
[32:42] and the problem is
[32:45] we get lazy
[32:48] and we don't do the job that has to be
[32:51] done
[33:29] the first thing I grabbed from the
[33:31] scripture is
[33:32] that they do it together
[33:35] in other words
[33:39] not only one side is getting sharpened
[33:42] up and the other one is not
[33:44] but both are doing it
[33:49] sharpens one another
[33:52] in other words they sharpen one another
[33:56] and I believe that's what happened in
[33:57] their relationships
[33:59] both grew up being together
[34:03] it wasn't just one person
[34:04] it was just one-sided
[34:10] well the whole problem was you no see no
[34:12] que loss but they said both of us need
[34:16] help
[34:17] I believe that in relation to work out
[34:20] well they have to do it together
[34:23] because both of them need help in a
[34:27] relationship
[34:29] it should be done together if you're
[34:33] going to help one another
[34:34] both are going to grow
[34:39] even if it was one person that made the
[34:41] mistake
[34:43] or one person that's struggling even
[34:45] more
[34:46] Persona the other one
[34:49] also has to change and put on their
[34:52] behalf to be of help
[34:56] so the person that needs it in that
[34:59] moment
[35:00] many times you want to change someone
[35:02] think
[35:03] without first changing ourselves
[35:14] that has the problem
[35:20] but here we see in the relationship of
[35:23] brother Isaac and her sister Christina
[35:27] is that both helps one another
[35:37] to be better
[35:40] but leave that relationship are all
[35:43] about
[35:44] has to be of help to make one better
[35:48] and one doesn't like to do exercise
[35:51] maybe the other person motivates them
[35:55] maybe the other person wants to eat
[35:57] whatever they want
[36:00] maybe the other person teaches them how
[36:02] to be a little healthier
[36:04] maybe one likes to leave their clothes
[36:06] all around the floor he
[36:12] both help one another
[36:16] when one of them likes to spend all the
[36:18] money
[36:20] and the other one likes to save
[36:23] one helps the others
[36:27] and both are willing to be better
[36:30] all right
[36:32] that's what's happened in this
[36:36] relationships
[36:38] both were in difficult situations
[36:41] and when they found one another
[36:44] say are you that on the helpful they
[36:47] gave each other their hands
[36:50] and they both came to be even sharper
[36:53] it wasn't just a one-sided thing
[36:58] how beautiful it is when you do things
[37:00] together
[37:03] now that's Point number one
[37:05] now Point number two is
[37:13] to help one another
[37:16] many times you want to attack
[37:52] something that Isaac said here
[37:55] foreign
[38:10] to update
[38:13] and I like that
[38:16] because I believe okay
[38:19] that's a problem with many of us
[38:21] actually we're un-updated
[38:28] it should be updated constantly and it
[38:31] says
[38:34] we get used to one another
[38:40] Persona we can stop to stop thinking
[38:43] about doing something else for the other
[38:44] person
[38:47] without energy without creativity is
[38:53] we just simply know he's my husband
[38:56] and we haven't come to realize
[39:01] years
[39:03] actually and we have to update ourselves
[39:08] because my husband is
[39:11] my wife is changing
[39:15] because what was of yesterday isn't of
[39:18] today
[39:21] that's how I felt yesterday it doesn't
[39:23] mean I feel the same way today
[39:25] maybe today I'm struggling
[39:59] we have stated in a past uh version
[40:04] and we don't realize that we could be of
[40:07] more help
[40:08] we could be better
[40:11] we stay mediocre nosed
[40:37] I'm a good wife
[40:41] we don't realize that we could be even
[40:44] better
[40:45] if we would update ourselves
[40:52] a knife that is not sharpened
[40:56] completely it's now fully fulfilling its
[41:00] purpose
[41:11] to know that these young people this
[41:13] couple has done
[41:15] and that they continue doing it
[41:18] continue sharpening one another
[41:21] keep on obtaining it
[41:24] continue learning of something new of
[41:27] one another
[41:28] know each other more
[41:31] there's always something more
[41:33] and always do it together
[41:37] and all
[41:39] so we're happy
[41:43] now we're going to continue on to the
[41:45] vows
[41:52] matrimony
[42:16] says
[42:22] neither one should go in this without
[42:24] accounting more lightly
[42:30] and in the fear of God
[42:34] in this holy State
[42:38] these two two people present
[42:41] come to be joined
[42:45] and if there and be anyone here
[42:49] they can show or just cause
[43:02] speak now
[43:04] or
[43:06] here on now keep your silence
[43:14] there's no one
[43:16] continuing glory god we can continue
[43:19] hold up
[43:21] this is
[43:26] I'll demand of you and make both of you
[43:28] responsible
[43:31] surely you shall give accounts on the
[43:34] day of judgments
