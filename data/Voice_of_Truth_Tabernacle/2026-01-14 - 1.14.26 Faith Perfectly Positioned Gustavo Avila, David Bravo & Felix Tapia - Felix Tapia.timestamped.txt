[1:34] But he couldn't get the inspiration on
[1:36] him
[1:37] and he was wearing him. And that when
[1:40] you get in that kind of fix that's when
[1:42] the enemy moves into friend near to you
[1:46] to accusing oh it must have been a
[1:49] miserable thing for him and all his
[1:51] friends that accused him. Satan then
[1:53] goes and jns himself with the enemy.
[1:56] That's when Satan comes in. Let me have
[1:59] him and I'll make him curse you. I'll
[2:02] make him deny message.
[2:05] I'll make him curse you. I'll make him
[2:07] go back and say it was all wrong.
[2:10] Then he tried him with everything he
[2:12] think to all the great man and friends
[2:14] that he used to have. But Job stood
[2:17] flatfoted
[2:19] for he knew he had heard
[2:27] tomorrow night.
[2:31] I heard of God that said something and
[2:35] it's going to happen that way. Just the
[2:38] same as these other things happen to
[2:41] happen
[2:44] now.
[2:46] J
[2:48] and now Job had something wrong with him
[2:52] but he couldn't get the inspiration on
[2:54] him
[2:55] and he was wearing him.
[2:57] And that when you get in that kind of
[3:00] fix that's when the enemy moves into
[3:02] friend near you got they accusing oh it
[3:06] must have been a miserable thing for him
[3:09] his friends that accus him satan then
[3:11] goes and jns himself with the enemy
[3:14] that's when Satan comes in let me have
[3:17] him and I'll make him curse I'll make
[3:20] him deny message.
[3:23] I'll make him curse you. I'll make him
[3:25] go back and say it was all wrong.
[3:28] Then he tried him with everything he
[3:30] could to all the great man and friends
[3:33] that he used to have. But Job stood
[3:35] flatfoted
[3:37] for he knew he had heard
[3:45] I get that wings
[3:49] I heard the voice of God that said
[3:51] something and it's going to happen that
[3:54] way the same as these other things
[3:58] happen. going to happen.
[4:03] Now,
[4:04] Job knew it was going to happen
[4:07] and he know that God had told him that
[4:09] that he was just, but they made him a
[4:12] sinner. So, he waited then for the
[4:14] inspiration. Satan getting all the the
[4:17] people come around his comforters so and
[4:21] accused him, but it didn't move him a
[4:22] bit.
[4:23] But when the word of God became
[4:27] vindicated to him, he had heard of God
[4:30] by the hearing of the ear, but one day
[4:33] setting out at his lowest point. And
[4:36] while he was sitting there and everyone
[4:39] accused him, even his wife tell him he
[4:41] was wrong, he scraping his boils. And
[4:45] Elahu came down and rebuked him for
[4:47] being selfish about the way he was
[4:50] accusing God and so forth.
[4:52] And then at that time it was when
[4:55] inspiration struck him. That's when the
[4:59] light begin to flesh, the thunders begin
[5:02] to roar. That's when the inspiration
[5:05] struck the prophet and he raised up and
[5:08] he said, "No, my redeemer liveth, and at
[5:11] the last days you'll stand up on this
[5:13] earth. No, the skin worms destroys this
[5:15] body yet in my flesh shall I see God. I
[5:19] shall see for myself.
[5:22] been talking about the trees, the boty
[5:25] life. Hi, dies and lives again. Water
[5:28] brings it back again. Smell of water,
[5:30] the scent of water, the results of water
[5:32] pouring up on a tree or something or
[5:35] seed that went to the ground. He said,
[5:36] "But a man lay it down to give it up the
[5:38] ghost his children come to him. He
[5:40] perceive it not. Or thou hide me in the
[5:42] grave." Job 14, th be if a man, shall he
[5:47] live again? all the pointed times of my
[5:49] life. I'll wait till my change comes.
[5:51] Thou will call me and I'll answer.
[5:53] Thought me balance and I cannot pass. So
[5:57] forth. He know all these things. He
[5:58] watched a tree live. But what happened
[6:00] to a man when he died? He didn't raise
[6:02] up again. So God was show him this
[6:05] redeemer.
[6:07] He wanted to see if there was somebody
[6:09] who could interceed for him. He had
[6:11] interceeded for so many people. But now
[6:14] is there somebody can speak for him?
[6:17] Could there somebody put his hand on Job
[6:19] or on a sinful man and a holy God and
[6:21] make bridges away? Could he go to his
[6:24] house and knock at the door? Would he
[6:25] open the door and talk to him a while?
[6:28] But then when the inspiration dropped
[6:30] into his heart, then he could see God.
[6:33] The lightnings are flashing, the
[6:35] thunders are roaring. And when it did,
[6:38] he stood up on his feet and he said, "I
[6:40] know my redeemer, live. My redeemer in
[6:43] the last days stand on the see he had to
[6:47] see God's reaction to his faith.
[6:51] Now we wonder if we could see God is
[6:54] there a way that we could see him now
[6:59] it was the only way God had tried job
[7:01] out. He said I have heard of thee with
[7:04] the hearing of the ear but now I see
[7:07] thee. But now I see thee with my eyes.
[7:11] The vision of the
[7:14] made
[7:16] he seen rolling around the flashing of
[7:20] the lightning or saw it and seen the
[7:23] rolling of the thunder maybe on a clear
[7:25] day and he seen God was in that cloud
[7:27] and that lightning he could see God with
[7:30] his natural.
[7:32] See, because the invisible was made
[7:34] visible, the visible vision of others
[7:38] was then vindicated clear to the natural
[7:41] eye. Just like faith with works as we
[7:45] spoke on last night. Abraham had no
[7:47] Bible to read either, but he was a
[7:49] prophet. his vision and his faith and it
[7:54] seem wrong to others that he should
[7:57] think that way that he should think
[7:59] going to have a baby but they did have
[8:01] the baby because his vision of the baby
[8:05] was what he was talking about. I'm going
[8:07] to have it. I'm going to have it. But
[8:09] when the baby was born, then the other
[8:11] people could see with the eye what he
[8:14] saw in a vision.
[8:16] And when you go to acting upon what you
[8:18] believe in your heart, then the people
[8:19] know God and know what's happening to
[8:22] you, but the way you act, that's how you
[8:25] see God with the eye. But to him,
[8:29] all he had done that was good, all that
[8:32] he had done for others, he needed
[8:34] somebody to interceed for him. When the
[8:36] birth of the baby come, Isaac, the um
[8:40] the inspiration that had led him to this
[8:43] had vindicated his vision to where the
[8:46] people could see that what he had in a
[8:48] vision was actually the truth. Now,
[8:52] sometimes these great pulsations of
[8:54] faith come right in the time of crisis.
[8:59] It's usually crisis that drives us into
[9:01] this. It was a crisis that drove Job
[9:05] into it. Why is the end of his life? His
[9:08] children was dead. his camels and all
[9:10] his goods was gone and destroyed and his
[9:12] own life broke out from the crown of his
[9:15] head to the souls of his feet with
[9:16] boils. It was a crisis that he pressed
[9:20] his
[9:23] inspiration strucking.
[9:25] men and women tonight. If you could look
[9:28] around and see how close we are to the
[9:30] coming of the Lord, you who cut off the
[9:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you may be
[9:35] relied upon some sensation or something
[9:37] that you done that Satan can impersonate
[9:40] and can't have the real spirit in you to
[9:43] go all the way in God's promises. How
[9:46] can a man that claims to have the Holy
[9:48] Ghost deny one word of this Bible being
[9:51] not right?
[9:53] You can't do it no matter how religious
[9:56] you are. How many churches you belong
[9:58] to, how many books your names on. If
[10:01] that genuine Holy Ghost is in you, which
[10:04] is this word manifested, you see the
[10:06] message of the hour because it's a Holy
[10:09] Ghost that does. But there has to be
[10:11] something light that off. Inspiration
[10:14] strike you. And if there's if you pour
[10:16] water on the ground, on the ground on
[10:18] the ground and there's no seed in there
[10:20] to strike it, how can it ever bring
[10:22] forth anything?
[10:24] There's nothing to bring for. That is
[10:27] that only the elected of God will see
[10:29] it. The elected of God Noah's time,
[10:32] Moses time, Jesus time, the apostles
[10:34] time, Luther's time, West time,
[10:36] Pentecostal time. Because that was a
[10:39] seed that was on the earth when this
[10:42] inspiration was poured out. Now, while
[10:44] the inspiration poured out together the
[10:46] bride together,
[10:48] it's only those who are elected will see
[10:50] it. Jesus said, "I thank the Father that
[10:52] thou hid these things from the eyes of
[10:54] the wise and prudent and reveal it to
[10:56] babe. Such is blurn." Now inspiration
[11:00] has to strike it. Now when the
[11:01] inspiration struck him that did it. He
[11:04] had it then. Now we find out it comes
[11:08] time of these crisis when the press is
[11:11] right on. And you look around today,
[11:14] look at the condition we're living in.
[11:16] Aren't we living in a modern Sodom
[11:18] Gamara?
[11:21] Hasn't the world come back? That was a
[11:23] gentile world that was destroyed then by
[11:26] fire. Didn't Jesus say in St. Luke the
[11:29] 17th chapter the 28 29th and 30th verse
[11:34] that as it was in the days of Sodom
[11:39] so shall it be in the coming of the Son
[11:41] of Man when the Son of Man is being
[11:43] revealed.
[11:45] What is a revealed? Is a secret made
[11:48] known.
[11:50] A revelation
[11:52] is to reveal or make a secret. Now these
[11:56] things been hit all through the church
[11:58] ages is now being revealed
[12:02] made one. Now we can say that and if God
[12:05] didn't back that up that's wrong.
[12:08] See, God don't need anybody to interpret
[12:10] his word. He's his own interpreter. He
[12:14] said a virgin shall conceive. And she
[12:16] did. He said let there be light. And
[12:19] there was and we are not living in
[12:22] Luther's age, Wesley age or the
[12:24] Pentecostal age. The pentecostal age is
[12:27] only a restoration of the gifts coming
[12:29] back to the church. But we're living in
[12:32] the evening time. We're living in the
[12:34] time of the calling out of the bride.
[12:37] Just as it was hard for the Catholics to
[12:39] see Luther and the Luthers to see the
[12:41] West and the Pentecost west to see the
[12:44] Pentecostal age. So is it hard for the
[12:46] Pentecostals to see this age?
[12:49] It's always been that way because it's
[12:51] poured out upon an elected seedah and
[12:55] not only what the Bible teaches.

[31:44] Creo que cuando nuestro pastor nos dijo
[31:45] el tema de esos servicios,
[31:50] yo creo que fue Dios que se lo dio a él.
[31:51] Amén.
[31:55] Y con eso les recuerdo que el tema de
[31:58] estos servicios será
[32:00] el Dios de lo imposible. Amén.
[32:08] Yo creo que el Dios de lo imposible ha
[32:10] sido visto en muchas vidas aquí.
[32:14] en estos ayunos. Amén.
[32:19] Pero también le quiero hablar a aquellos
[32:22] que tal vez a lo mejor
[32:26] el Dios de lo imposible
[32:31] todavía no se le ha revelado a las vidas
[32:33] de ellos,
[32:36] pero les traigo palabras de esperanza.
[32:39] Él lo hará.
[32:41] Él lo hará.
[32:43] Y con eso,
[32:47] igualmente les doy el título de esta
[32:48] noche,
[32:52] fe perfectamente posicionada
[32:56] porque no nos hace nada bien
[33:00] de conocer o saber de un Dios de lo
[33:02] imposible.
[33:06] Si no tenemos fe en ese Dios de lo
[33:08] imposible.
[33:12] Y con eso si me pueden seguir al libro
[33:14] de Lucas, capítulo 1,
[33:18] Lucas capítulo 1, versículo 34.
[33:24] Le damos la bienvenida a cada uno
[33:25] mirando a través del internet.
[33:30] Los amamos a cada uno y gracias por
[33:32] estar con nosotros.
[33:35] Estamos todos con expectativa,
[33:38] estamos todos emocionados.
[33:42] Yo estoy emocionado de lo que va a
[33:43] suceder en estos servicios.
[33:47] Versículo 34.
[33:55] Entonces María dijo al ángel, "¿Cómo
[33:56] será esto?" Pues no conozco varón.
[34:02] Versículo 37 le así.
[34:08] Porque nada hay imposible para Dios, que
[34:11] repetirlo,
[34:13] porque con Dios
[34:16] nada hay imposible.
[34:20] Y María dice en versículo 38,
[34:24] "He aquí la sierva del Señor,
[34:28] hágase conmigo conforme a tu palabra."
[34:32] Oremos.
[34:34] Padre lleno de gracia,
[34:38] estoy nervioso,
[34:41] estoy emocionado,
[34:45] estoy lleno de muchas cosas, Señor.
[34:49] Señor, que tú hagas toda cosa a un lado,
[34:53] Señor, porque tu pueblo está aquí esta
[34:54] noche.
[34:56] Yo creo que ellos han venido con una
[34:57] expectativa.
[35:00] Ellos saben que algo está a punto de
[35:01] suceder. Ellos
[35:04] saben que tú vas a derramarte
[35:08] porque tú los has estado visitando,
[35:09] Señor, en este ayuno.
[35:14] Tú has mirado su sacrificio, Señor.
[35:18] Tú has visto el hambre que tienen por
[35:19] ti, Señor.
[35:22] Señor, yo creo que has estado yendo a
[35:23] nuestro pastor
[35:25] para que tengamos estos servicios,
[35:29] para que te puedas mostrar de una manera
[35:30] increíble, Señor,
[35:33] para que yo con mis hermanos
[35:35] nos hagamos a un lado
[35:38] y levantemos la fe del pueblo
[35:41] para que tú te muestres
[35:44] en sus vidas esta noche.
[35:46] Te agradecemos por estas cosas
[35:49] en el nombre de Jesucristo.
[35:51] Amén. Puedan tomar sus asientos.
[35:54] Amén.
[35:55] Repítalo conmigo,
[35:58] porque con Dios
[36:01] nada será imposible.
[36:04] Tengo que repetir,
[36:06] porque con Dios
[36:10] nada será imposible. Amén. Podemos creer
[36:12] eso, iglesia.
[36:15] Lo hemos visto tras vez.
[36:19] Yo creo que lo miraremos en esos
[36:20] servicios.
[36:22] El hermano Branham dice en el mensaje
[36:24] fe,
[36:26] predicado el 1956,
[36:31] dice María la Virgen
[36:33] tomó en su palabra,
[36:37] tomó a Dios en su palabra. Lo imposible
[36:39] se hizo posible.
[36:42] Pero yo creo que la palabra de Dios,
[36:46] el Dios de lo imposible,
[36:50] no nos dio una palabra imposible para
[36:52] vivir.
[36:54] Escúcheme, iglesia,
[36:57] pero nos ha dado una palabra
[37:00] que usted y yo nos podemos identificar,
[37:03] que usted y yo
[37:06] podemos posicionar nuestra fe
[37:08] correctamente allí.
[37:10] Porque si María
[37:14] no hubiera dudado o cuestionado el ángel
[37:16] del Señor, si ella, la Biblia
[37:21] solo menciona
[37:24] que el ángel vino a María,
[37:27] le dijo que ella va a concibir un hijo y
[37:29] lo llamaría Jesús.
[37:31] Y luego dijo, "María, he aquí."
[37:36] Entonces, usted y yo nunca podemos basar
[37:37] nuestra fe allí. ¿Verdad?
[37:40] Pero yo le agradezco a Dios.
[37:44] Dios colocó el versículo 34 ahí para mí
[37:46] y para usted.
[37:49] Usted y yo nos podemos identificar con
[37:50] María.
[37:54] Sabemos que estamos buscando Dios de lo
[37:55] imposible.
[37:57] Estamos buscando un Dios grande,
[38:02] pero a veces nos encontramos bajo
[38:03] limitaciones humanas
[38:06] porque al fin del día somos humanos.
[38:10] Y igual que María,
[38:12] cuestionamos
[38:14] cuando la palabra de Dios
[38:17] viene a nuestra vida,
[38:19] nos dice lo que va a suceder,
[38:22] pero aún así
[38:25] tenemos razonamientos y preguntas.
[38:28] ¿O acaso soy el único?
[38:30] Soy el único,
[38:33] pero le agradezco a Dios que puso a
[38:35] María,
[38:37] que dijo, "¿Cómo va a suceder esto?"
[38:41] Pero el mensaje es fe.
[38:44] El menciona a María aquí,
[38:47] pero también menciona a Abraham.
[38:51] Y yo creo que aquí, usted y yo nos
[38:53] podemos identificar.
[38:55] Y dice esto,
[38:57] y Abraham
[38:59] tomó la palabra de Dios
[39:04] en lo imposible.
[39:07] Eso es clave o llave.
[39:10] Tomó a Dios en lo imposible
[39:15] hasta que se convirtió posible.
[39:20] Así que podemos mirar a María ahora como
[39:23] usted y yo,
[39:26] cuestionando la palabra de Dios.
[39:29] [Aplausos]
[39:30] Se nos ha predicado la palabra vez tras
[39:32] vez
[39:35] y luego Dios nos las vuel explicar,
[39:39] pero podemos ver aquí que María,
[39:42] donde su fe de ella
[39:45] finalmente llegó a ser colocada.
[39:49] donde ella simplemente pudo decir,
[39:52] "¿Sabes qué, Dios?
[39:55] Ya estoy cansado y enfadada de tratar de
[39:57] entenderte.
[40:00] Estoy cansado de tratar de hacerlo mi
[40:02] manera.
[40:03] He aquí,
[40:06] he aquí la sierva del Señor.
[40:09] Haz como tú quieras,
[40:13] tu voluntad en mi vida.
[40:16] Yo creo que es tenemos que llegar a ese
[40:18] punto, iglesia,
[40:20] simplemente olvidarnos de lo demás
[40:23] y colocar nuestra fe en la palabra de
[40:25] Dios
[40:27] y tomarlo como él es.
[40:31] El hermano Branham dice en ese mismo
[40:32] mensaje,
[40:36] si cualquiera
[40:39] toma Dios en su palabra,
[40:42] su palabra se hará manifiesta.
[40:45] Y aquí está.
[40:48] Y si esa simiente
[40:51] cae en el terreno adecuado,
[40:55] ¿escucharon esto, iglesia?
[40:58] Si cae en el terreno adecuado,
[41:03] producirá exactamente lo que dijo, qué
[41:05] produciría.
[41:07] y amo esto
[41:12] porque hay algo sobre cuando alguien
[41:13] sabe lo que está hablando.
[41:16] Aquí el hermano BR dice,
[41:18] "Pongan eso en la grabación,
[41:21] pongan eso en la grabación", dice,
[41:23] "Estas cintas que salen,
[41:28] la actitud mental correcta." Hola, ¿está
[41:32] a alguien esta noche?
[41:35] Dice, "La actitud mental correcta
[41:40] hacia cualquier promesa divina de Dios
[41:43] hará que se cumpla
[41:47] si la mira correctamente
[41:51] y se dará cuenta quién hizo la promesa."
[41:55] Así que yo creo igual que María.
[41:58] Muchas veces nos encontramos
[42:01] escuchando la palabra de Dios.
[42:04] Pero de repente
[42:06] nos llega
[42:08] y nos damos cuenta
[42:11] quién verdaderamente nos está hablando.
[42:14] No es el hermano Gustavo,
[42:16] no es el hermano Alex, no es el hermano
[42:19] Eduardo o el hermano Félix,
[42:21] pero es el ángel del Señor
[42:24] usándolos
[42:26] para que abren a mi vida
[42:29] y luego yo puedo tomar mi fe
[42:32] en lo que ellos están hablando
[42:35] sobre la palabra de Dios,
[42:38] colocarla correctamente
[42:41] y traer la manifestación.
[42:43] a mi vida.
[42:46] Amén.
[42:47] [Aplausos]
[42:49] Porque todos nos encontramos
[42:54] donde la lógica se nos acaba, ¿verdad?
[42:58] Estoy hablándole a alguien
[43:02] escuchando los testimonios hermosos el
[43:04] miércoles,
[43:07] perdón, el domingo. Gracias.
[43:12] Estoy hablándole a alguien que tal vez
[43:13] escuchó,
[43:18] que el doctor le dijo que ya no hay nada
[43:20] más que podemos hacer por usted.
[43:23] Estoy hablándole tal vez a alguien
[43:27] que por medio de estos días
[43:31] ha tenido problemas económicos, tal vez
[43:35] las cuentas no están saliendo.
[43:39] Tal vez le estoy hablando a alguien
[43:41] y yo no estoy casado.
[43:45] Tal vez tengan problemas de matrimonio,
[43:48] de relaciones.
[43:51] Tal vez ya no saben qué hacer.
[43:54] Tal vez la relación con su hijo,
[43:56] relación con su hija,
[44:01] tal vez usted está como yo,
[44:05] donde usted siente que mi fe está
[44:07] menguando, está debilitando,
[44:12] donde no puedo encontrar las palabras o
[44:14] la respuesta,
[44:16] pero las estoy buscando.
[44:19] Las estoy buscando, iglesia.
[44:22] Yo sé que hay un Dios lo imposible.
[44:25] Yo sé que hay un Dios
[44:28] que puede hacer lo imposible en mi vida.
[44:32] Pero aquí está la cosa.
[44:37] Lo imposible no es la limitación de
[44:39] Dios,
[44:41] es la invitación de Dios. Lo voy a
[44:44] repetir.
[44:47] Lo imposible
[44:49] no es la limitación de Dios.
[44:52] es la invitación de Dios a mi vida y
[44:55] para su vida.
[44:58] Yo estoy agradecido con Dios porque
[45:03] que la Biblia no solamente está basada
[45:07] historias de logros,
[45:10] pero es una colección de personas, de
[45:13] situaciones.
[45:16] Cuando se termina o acaba la habilidad
[45:19] humana,
[45:21] entonces ahí es cuando entra Dios.
[45:25] [Aplausos]
[45:27] Pero muchas veces el nos quiere
[45:28] atacar allí
[45:31] en nuestra limitación humana.
[45:35] Pero quiero decir eso y quiero que lo
[45:36] digan conmigo.
[45:38] Yo soy humano
[45:42] y tengo limitaciones.
[45:45] Está bien.
[45:46] Podemos aceptarlo.
[45:49] Que somos limitados.
[45:53] En el libro de Mateo 19 dice,
[45:58] Jesús le está hablando a sus discípulos
[45:59] y dice,
[46:02] "Con hombre esto es imposible,
[46:06] pero amo lo que dice después.
[46:09] Pero con Dios
[46:12] todas las cosas son posibles."
[46:16] Estoy hablándole a alguien,
[46:18] ¿eso le ayuda a alguien? ¿En dando eso a
[46:20] alguien? Porque me ha estado ayudando a
[46:23] mí.
[46:25] Yo no puedo hacer cosas
[46:27] y está bien
[46:30] porque yo conozco un Dios que puede
[46:33] cuidar
[46:35] donde yo no puedo.
[46:38] Dios nunca niega la realidad, iglesia.
[46:42] Jesús claramente lo dice.
[46:46] Hay cosas que el hombre no puede hacer,
[46:50] pero si podemos aceptar eso
[46:53] y no permitir que el nos ataque
[46:55] con eso,
[46:57] porque al fin del día somos humanos,
[46:59] ¿verdad? Fallamos y fallamos y fallamos,
[47:02] ¿verdad?
[47:05] A veces el nos quiere atacar allí
[47:09] y estamos avanzando, estamos en este
[47:12] ayuno y queremos avanzar, queremos
[47:16] crecer, queremos mejorarnos,
[47:19] pero después caemos o fallamos o
[47:22] quedamos cortos, llegamos a nuestros
[47:25] límites
[47:27] y luego el nos quiere atacar allí
[47:30] y decir que eso no era real.
[47:33] Lo que estabas haciendo no era genuino,
[47:36] porque si fuera real y genuino,
[47:41] no estuvieras batallando, quedando corto
[47:43] o fallando.
[47:45] Estoy hablándole a alguien allí.
[47:51] Pero muchas veces
[47:54] si nos encontramos desanimados
[47:57] y eso está bien, iglesia,
[48:01] porque a menudo nos hallamos desanimados
[48:06] porque estamos esperando por respuestas
[48:09] humanas
[48:11] para o soluciones humanas para problemas
[48:15] divinos.
[48:16] Lo voy a repetir.
[48:19] Estamos buscando soluciones humanas,
[48:23] soluciones humanas
[48:26] para problemas divinos.
[48:32] Muchas veces
[48:35] tratamos de adelantarnos en Dios.
[48:38] Queremos que las cosas se hagan a
[48:39] nuestro tiempo.
[48:42] Supuestamente queremos ayudarle a Dios.
[48:45] Pero en vez de ayudarle a Dios,
[48:48] nos desanimamos a nosotros aún más
[48:52] porque estamos esperando algo
[48:55] que está fuera de nuestro alcance y está
[48:58] bien
[49:00] porque donde no podamos alcanzar,
[49:04] Dios nos da las pulgadas extras que nos
[49:06] faltan.
[49:09] Ahora, mi pregunta para usted es,
[49:12] ¿en dónde está su fe colocada?
[49:16] está colocada en sus habilidades
[49:20] o la está colocando en las habilidades
[49:21] de Dios, en el carácter de Dios,
[49:27] porque mientras vamos avanzando en esos
[49:29] servicios
[49:32] se va a poner más y más difícil.
[49:36] El va a querer detenerlo,
[49:38] detenerlo, hacernos dudar
[49:41] para que no recibamos lo que es para
[49:44] nosotros.
[49:47] Pero si podemos hacer lo mismo que hizo
[49:48] María,
[49:50] igual que Abraham, igual
[49:54] colocar nuestra fe
[49:56] en la palabra de Dios
[50:00] y lo podemos hacer lo mismo que Abraham
[50:02] y María hicieron.
[50:05] creer a Dios en lo imposible
[50:09] hasta que llegue lo posible.
[50:12] Amén. Dios los bendiga.
[50:17] [Aplausos]
[50:22] Dios los bendiga.
[50:26] Les dio la bienvenida en el nombre del
[50:27] Señor Jesucristo.
[50:30] Voy a estar leyendo unas escrituras.
[50:34] Les sugiero que simplemente las escrib.
[50:38] Las voy a leer rápidamente aquí.
[50:42] Mateo 17:20.
[50:45] Jesús les dijo,
[50:49] "Porque por vuestra poca fe,
[50:53] porque de cierto os digo
[50:57] que si tuvieres fe como un grano de
[50:59] mostaza,
[51:01] diréis a este monte,
[51:04] pásate de aquí allá
[51:07] y se pasará
[51:10] y nada os será imposible.
[51:14] Lucas 18:27.
[51:17] Él les dijo,
[51:19] "Lo que es imposible para los hombres
[51:22] es posible para Dios."
[51:25] Hebreos 11:6.
[51:28] Pero sin fe
[51:30] es imposible agradar a Dios,
[51:34] porque es necesario que el que se
[51:35] acerque a Dios
[51:37] crea que le hay
[51:40] y que es galardonador
[51:43] de los que le buscan.
[51:48] El Dios de lo imposible.
[51:50] ¿Cuántos creen eso?
[51:53] Amén.
[51:54] Como decía nuestro hermano Gustavo,
[51:57] nuestro título es
[52:00] fe posicionalmente colocada,
[52:03] correctamente colocada, perdón.
[52:06] Nosotros como seres humanos,
[52:11] nosotros medimos nuestro ambiente
[52:15] de acuerdo a nuestras propias fuerzas y
[52:18] entendimiento.
[52:21] Pero la manera que Dios mide las cosas,
[52:25] Dios mide las cosas a través de su
[52:27] naturaleza.
[52:29] Ahora
[52:31] hemos escuchado nuestro profeta
[52:34] que fe es el sexto sentido,
[52:38] que fe es el canal directo
[52:41] a Dios.
[52:44] Ahora, cuando los discípulos
[52:48] querían echar fuera un demonio de un
[52:49] muchacho,
[52:51] no pudieron hacerlo.
[52:54] Y la razón fue
[52:57] Jesús les dijo, "Fue por su
[52:59] incredulidad.
[53:02] Si solo tuvieran fe como del tamaño de
[53:05] semilla de mostaza,
[53:07] pueden mover montañas
[53:10] y nada sería imposible para ustedes.
[53:14] Déjeme decirle, hermanos,
[53:16] si usted tiene la fe correcta,
[53:19] fe correcta y genuina,
[53:22] nada le será imposible para usted.
[53:26] que Jesús dijo,
[53:30] Jesús no dijo que sería posible con
[53:32] Dios.
[53:36] Jesús dijo, "No será imposible a ti."
[53:40] Él nos dio la autoridad a nosotros.
[53:44] Y ahora la el tamaño de la del tamaño de
[53:47] semilla de mostaza obra
[53:51] no porque tiene la fuerza por ella
[53:53] misma,
[53:55] pero porque está colocada
[53:58] y está conectada directamente a Dios, a
[54:02] un Dios todopoderoso.
[54:05] No se trata de cuánto usted tenga,
[54:08] pero es en quién usted lo ponga,
[54:11] en qué lo posicione usted.
[54:15] Depende de nosotros,
[54:17] en quién le pongamos nuestra fe,
[54:20] a quién vamos a correr
[54:24] cuando estemos enfrente de lo imposible,
[54:27] cuando lleguemos a nuestras
[54:28] limitaciones,
[54:30] nuestras limitaciones humanas,
[54:33] porque lo imposible
[54:38] solamente está en nuestro vocabulario,
[54:41] no existe en el vocabulario de Dios.
[54:44] Dios no conoce que es lo imposible.
[54:48] Como humanos tenemos limitaciones,
[54:51] pero Dios no.
[54:53] Dios es un Dios sin límites.
[54:56] Déjeme decirle, hermanos,
[54:59] Dios es un caballero.
[55:03] Él no va a forzar sus obras
[55:06] en un corazón que no esté dispuesto,
[55:11] un corazón que no esté dispuesto en en
[55:13] colocar su fe.
[55:16] Ve la incredulidad
[55:19] no limita a Dios.
[55:23] Simplemente está limitado lo que podemos
[55:25] experimentar con Dios.
[55:27] Limita los beneficios
[55:30] que podemos tener con Dios,
[55:33] porque con incredulidad
[55:36] nos hace falta ese canal directo con
[55:39] Dios,
[55:41] nos hace falta los recursos con Dios
[55:47] porque fe es la certeza, las cosas que
[55:49] se esperan.
[55:51] La convicción de las cosas que no se
[55:52] ven.
[55:55] La fe se conecta a la otra esfera,
[55:59] donde nuestras respuestas se encuentran,
[56:02] donde nuestra ayuda se encuentra.
[56:06] Por eso tenemos que tener fe genuina
[56:10] y no solamente fe genuina,
[56:13] pero fe genuina colocado en Dios, en
[56:17] Dios.
[56:19] Es un sacrificio que tenemos que hacer
[56:21] para Dios.
[56:23] Tenemos que
[56:25] morir en nuestras vidas
[56:28] y dejar rendir todo a sus pies,
[56:33] tomar nuestra cruz diario y seguirlo.
[56:39] El hermano Branham dice,
[56:42] "En la resurrección de Lázaro,
[56:44] predicado en el año 51,
[56:47] miren, deidad,
[56:50] yo soy una parte de Charles Branham.
[56:53] Porque nací de Charlie Branham, mi papá.
[56:57] Yo soy parte de él.
[56:59] Yo tengo la frente como la de él. Mi
[57:02] cabello era como el de él. Soy un hombre
[57:05] pequeño como él.
[57:07] Soy igual en naturaleza como él, porque
[57:10] él es mi papá.
[57:13] Y si nosotros llegamos a ser en espíritu
[57:15] hijos de Dios,
[57:17] te da la vida en el hombre.
[57:21] Entonces usted habla sobre ojos ciegos
[57:23] siendo abiertos.
[57:26] Ellos dicen que no hay nada imposible
[57:27] para Dios.
[57:30] Dios dice que no hay nada imposible con
[57:32] usted si lo va a creer, no con Dios, con
[57:37] usted
[57:38] de edad en el hombre,
[57:41] el mismo Dios que estuvo allí atrás
[57:45] en la plataforma mítica de las
[57:46] eternidades
[57:48] y que sacó mundos de sus manos
[57:51] y creó estas cosas
[57:54] que le da a usted privilegio de ser su
[57:55] hijo y usted es parte de él.
[58:00] Y Dios mora en la humanidad
[58:03] y el hombre mismo es deidad. Ahí lo
[58:05] tienen, eso los puede atragantar.
[58:09] Pero estudie eso un poco. Ven,
[58:13] Dios habita en el hombre
[58:15] y el hombre llegó a ser hijo de Dios,
[58:19] no de por sí,
[58:21] sino el Espíritu Santo
[58:24] que está en él es Dios.
[58:27] El creador vive en la creación o vaya.
[58:31] ¿Cómo pienso de eso?
[58:34] Después páese con una fe inquebrantable
[58:38] y pida lo que quiera
[58:40] le será hecho.
[58:43] Deidad está en el hombre,
[58:46] es el Espíritu Santo dentro de nosotros.
[58:49] Pero para llegar a ese punto
[58:52] se toma un sacrificio,
[58:54] una dedicación que tenemos que hacer.
[58:57] Tenemos que negar a nuestros propios
[58:58] deseos,
[59:00] nuestras ambiciones, nuestra voluntad
[59:04] y poder obedecer la voluntad de él y
[59:07] tomar nuestra cruz.
[59:10] Él requiere nuestra obediencia total,
[59:14] nuestra rendimiento total
[59:16] en orden para seguirlo.
[59:20] Tenemos que estar completamente
[59:22] consagrados
[59:24] y una vida rendida.
[59:26] para producir
[59:29] resultados imposibles.
[59:33] Dios solamente usa
[59:36] lo que nosotros le damos.
[59:38] Por ejemplo,
[59:42] Sansón le dio a Dios sus fuerzas,
[59:45] pero no su corazón.
[59:48] Dios pudo usar sus fuerzas,
[59:51] pero tarde o temprano
[59:53] Samson fracasó.
[59:56] Porque nunca le rendió a Dios su
[59:58] corazón.
[1:00:00] Dios solamente puede usar lo que usted
[1:00:03] le dé a él.
[1:00:05] Por eso él no puede usar
[1:00:08] un corazón que no esté dispuesto.
[1:00:11] ¿Saben?
[1:00:17] Las realidades infalibles del Dios vivo.
[1:00:24] ¿Qué puede usted dar?
[1:00:27] Dios recibirá lo que usted le dará.
[1:00:30] Pero escuche aquí, iglesia.
[1:00:32] Pero Dios lo quiere todo a usted.
[1:00:36] Él quiere cada porcioncita de usted. Él
[1:00:39] quiere todo.
[1:00:41] Él quiere todo lo que usted es. Él
[1:00:44] quiere su vida, él quiere su testimonio.
[1:00:48] Él quiere cada minuto de su vida.
[1:00:51] Él quiere que usted viva bien, actúe
[1:00:54] bien, hable bien, obre bien.
[1:01:00] Él quiere todo perfectamente rendido a
[1:01:02] él para que él pueda dirigirlo
[1:01:06] y guiarlo
[1:01:08] y llevarlo a lugares
[1:01:11] donde él quiere que usted vaya.
[1:01:14] Depende de nosotros, iglesia.
[1:01:18] Si usted siente que le falta fe esta
[1:01:19] noche, diga, "Señor,
[1:01:23] aumenta mi fe.
[1:01:25] Dame fe genuina
[1:01:28] y ayúdame a posicionar en tus manos,
[1:01:31] en las manos del todopoderoso.
[1:01:34] Es la única manera
[1:01:38] para recibir algo de Dios."
[1:01:40] Es lo que dijo el hermano Branham.
[1:01:43] La única cosa que podemos recibir de
[1:01:45] Dios es por medio de la fe.
[1:01:49] Moisés
[1:01:52] liberó al pueblo por medio de la fe.
[1:01:55] Gedeón por fe
[1:01:57] pudo ir a la guerra.
[1:02:00] Josué por fe
[1:02:03] conquistó la tierra prometida.
[1:02:06] Jesús por fe
[1:02:09] caminó esta tierra con el hombre.
[1:02:12] él mismo siendo Dios
[1:02:16] y siguió la voluntad de Dios por su
[1:02:19] vida.
[1:02:20] Es todo por medio de la fe, pero no solo
[1:02:24] fe.
[1:02:26] Fe correctamente posicionada.
[1:02:30] Fe, fe sin obras es muerte.
[1:02:33] Por eso esta noche, iglesia,
[1:02:35] tenemos que comenzar a testificar,
[1:02:39] testificar nuestra liberación.
[1:02:42] testifique su bendición.
[1:02:45] Las bendiciones que vienen para usted
[1:02:47] pueden venir esta noche
[1:02:50] o esta semana, las el mes que viene, tal
[1:02:54] vez en algunos años, pero tarde o
[1:02:57] temprano
[1:02:59] sucederá
[1:03:01] porque mi Dios lo ha dicho
[1:03:04] y mi Dios cumple cada promesa.
[1:03:07] Y eso es fe, hermanos.
[1:03:10] poder creer en Dios,
[1:03:12] confiar en Dios
[1:03:15] hasta que él cumpla lo que ha prometido.
[1:03:18] ¿Sabe? Esta semana
[1:03:21] esta semana no va a ser limitada por
[1:03:22] Dios. Esta semana va a ser limitada
[1:03:27] por lo que usted está dispuesto a creer.
[1:03:30] Así que iglesia esta noche hay que
[1:03:33] creer.
[1:03:35] Si no tiene fe, pida Señor,
[1:03:40] aumenta mi fe. Señor,
[1:03:43] si no confío en ti,
[1:03:46] ayúdame a colocar mi vida en tus manos.
[1:03:51] Ayúdame a poner todo lo que yo soy en
[1:03:53] tus manos.
[1:03:55] Ayúdame a verdaderamente rendirme mi
[1:03:58] vida, mis mi tiempo, mi fe, mi corazón,
[1:04:04] mi alma. A ti, Señor.
[1:04:08] Es la única manera, iglesia,
[1:04:11] un corazón completamente consagrado a
[1:04:13] Dios
[1:04:15] y fe genuina colocada en él.
[1:04:19] Hay que comenzar a testificar, iglesia.
[1:04:22] El hermano Branham dice que María
[1:04:30] tuvo más que creer
[1:04:33] que Zacarías,
[1:04:35] el padre de Juan el Bautista.
[1:04:38] Ahora, Zacarías
[1:04:41] tenía ejemplos previos.
[1:04:44] tuvo Abraham, tuvo a Ana
[1:04:49] y aún con esos ejemplos,
[1:04:52] él batalló en creer en lo imposible.
[1:04:55] Pero María,
[1:04:58] María pudo creer en lo imposible
[1:05:02] y ella no esperó
[1:05:04] para una señal
[1:05:07] que ella iba a concebir un bebé.
[1:05:10] Ella comenzó a testificar rápido.
[1:05:13] Ella dijo, "Yo tendré un bebé
[1:05:16] porque mi Dios me dijo,
[1:05:19] yo voy a tener este niño
[1:05:21] y su nombre será Jesús
[1:05:25] y será Dios caminando con el hombre
[1:05:29] y sería el salvador de Israel."
[1:05:32] Ella no esperó
[1:05:34] por los sentimientos.
[1:05:36] Ella no esperó por las señales.
[1:05:41] Ella simplemente creyó en el Dios de lo
[1:05:42] imposible
[1:05:44] y testificó.
[1:05:47] Cualquier cosa que usted esté esperando,
[1:05:49] cualquier cosa que usted esté pidiendo,
[1:05:52] se le hará a usted
[1:05:55] si solamente usted puede creer,
[1:05:58] porque nada con Dios es imposible.
[1:06:02] Y nada, nada con usted será imposible.
[1:06:07] Simplemente ríndase usted a él esta
[1:06:09] noche. Dios los bendiga.
[1:06:12] [Aplausos]
[1:06:21] Amén.
[1:06:23] ¿Cómo se sienten, iglesia?
[1:06:27] Yo solamente quiero decirle esto
[1:06:28] ahorita.
[1:06:32] Todo es posible
[1:06:34] con Dios.
[1:06:36] Si usted lo cree,
[1:06:39] si no tiene ninguna duda,
[1:06:41] si usted cree en Dios,
[1:06:44] si tiene fe en Dios,
[1:06:46] si tiene fe en su palabra,
[1:06:49] todo es posible.
[1:06:54] La Biblia dice en Isaías 43:19,
[1:06:58] dice, "He aquí,
[1:07:02] yo hago cosa nueva.
[1:07:06] [Aplausos]
[1:07:07] Pronto saldrá a luz,
[1:07:10] no la conoceréis.
[1:07:15] Otra vez abriré camino
[1:07:18] en el desierto
[1:07:20] y ríos.
[1:07:23] En la soledad,
[1:07:27] Dios se especializa en lugares
[1:07:32] donde no hay salida.
[1:07:36] Cuando se termina el camino para usted,
[1:07:40] allí es donde el camino empieza para
[1:07:42] Dios.
[1:07:43] Ahí es donde empieza la fe.
[1:07:47] Cuando tú llegas al fin del camino,
[1:07:51] ahí es donde Dios empieza.
[1:07:54] Aquí es donde Dios abre camino.
[1:07:59] Viene la duda. A veces
[1:08:02] llegamos al fin del camino,
[1:08:04] no miramos ninguna otra salida, otro
[1:08:06] camino. No hay otro camino.
[1:08:12] Cuando cuando se nos da el el reporte
[1:08:14] médico
[1:08:18] y el doctor nos dice algo diferente,
[1:08:22] nos dice el resultado que no
[1:08:23] esperábamos.
[1:08:31] Cuando llega el problema financiero,
[1:08:34] cuando pierdes tu empleo,
[1:08:37] cuando no recibes el empleo que estabas
[1:08:39] esperando,
[1:08:41] cuando tu negocio se va a la quiebra,
[1:08:44] cuando tu tu negocio se va a la quiebra,
[1:08:48] cuando no hay salida,
[1:08:53] cuando oramos
[1:08:55] y seguimos orando,
[1:08:57] y seguimos orando
[1:09:00] y decimos que tenemos fe,
[1:09:02] pero no hay respuesta a esa oración.
[1:09:07] ¿Qué es lo que hacemos?
[1:09:15] Aleluya. María,
[1:09:20] cuando ella recibió esa noticia
[1:09:27] que desfiaba la biología,
[1:09:32] la lógica y cultura.
[1:09:36] No había ni siquiera ninguna
[1:09:38] expectativa,
[1:09:40] no había ninguna prueba.
[1:09:43] Pero escuche esto, iglesia.
[1:09:46] Había una promesa.
[1:09:50] Había una promesa en su palabra.
[1:09:55] Había algo especial en esa palabra.
[1:09:59] Dios la encuentra en ese lugar donde no
[1:10:02] había ninguna posibilidad
[1:10:05] y él lo hizo posible.
[1:10:09] Mir, yo digo esto por mí mismo.
[1:10:12] A veces dependemos tanto,
[1:10:17] dependemos de nuestra facultad humana
[1:10:19] muchas de las veces. Yo puedo hacer
[1:10:21] esto.
[1:10:23] Yo tengo la habilidad,
[1:10:25] tengo la fuerza,
[1:10:28] tengo el negocio, el plan del negocio.
[1:10:33] Yo tengo que que puede vencer esas
[1:10:35] enfermedades.
[1:10:36] [Música]
[1:10:42] Miramos lo que podemos,
[1:10:46] confiamos en lo que podemos,
[1:10:49] lo que podemos ver, lo que podemos
[1:10:52] tocar,
[1:10:54] lo que podemos medir,
[1:10:57] lo que podemos controlar.
[1:11:00] Pero déjeme decirle algo,
[1:11:03] hermano Víctor, hermano Víctor,
[1:11:06] brother Victor, brother Victor.
[1:11:11] Nuestra facultad humana o la naturaleza
[1:11:14] humana
[1:11:16] tiene limitaciones,
[1:11:19] tiene un fin,
[1:11:24] tiene algo que los para.
[1:11:27] Por eso, cuando se nos dan unas malas
[1:11:29] noticias,
[1:11:30] el temor viene a nosotros.
[1:11:36] La la el fallo de esperanza,
[1:11:40] la negatividad
[1:11:43] nos oprime,
[1:11:46] nos quiere quebrar,
[1:11:49] nos lleva a lugares
[1:11:52] donde empezamos a cuestionar a Dios.
[1:11:55] ¿Por qué tenemos que atravesar por esto?
[1:11:58] Decimos,
[1:12:00] ¿por qué esto está sucediendo en mi
[1:12:02] vida?
[1:12:05] ¿Por qué no estoy recibiendo las
[1:12:06] respuestas que yo estoy pidiendo?
[1:12:11] Oh, la batalla se pone más dura.
[1:12:14] Cuando empezamos a cuestionar eso,
[1:12:18] cuando empezamos a decir, "Esto es
[1:12:20] difícil,
[1:12:22] no lo puedo hacer.
[1:12:27] Ahí es cuando estamos dependiendo de
[1:12:28] nuestras habilidades humanas.
[1:12:31] Ahí es donde estamos dependiendo
[1:12:35] dependiendo de nuestros sentimientos,
[1:12:38] dependiendo de lo que podemos ver.
[1:12:41] Yo sé que duele.
[1:12:45] Yo sé que duele
[1:12:47] cuando esas cosas se quebran.
[1:12:55] María no entendía lo que estaba
[1:12:56] sucediendo.
[1:12:59] Ella no estaba entendiendo lo que estaba
[1:13:00] pasando.
[1:13:03] No entendía lo que Dios estaba haciendo,
[1:13:07] pero ella creyó no importando.
[1:13:11] Iglesia
[1:13:14] no miró a las circunstancias.
[1:13:18] A veces es lo que tenemos que hacer,
[1:13:20] hermano Timy.
[1:13:23] No tenemos que ver a las circunstancias,
[1:13:27] no tenemos que ver lo que está pasando
[1:13:28] alrededor de nosotros,
[1:13:30] no lo que nos está doliendo.
[1:13:32] Tenemos que mirar
[1:13:35] a la palabra de Dios.
[1:13:37] ¿Sabe qué, hermanos?
[1:13:40] No entiendo toda la palabra,
[1:13:42] ni siquiera sé leer muy bien.
[1:13:45] Pero, ¿sabe qué?
[1:13:48] Yo creo en la palabra.
[1:13:53] Yo creo en la manifestación de la
[1:13:54] palabra,
[1:13:56] que él nunca nos va a dejar.
[1:14:00] Él estará siempre con nosotros
[1:14:04] sin importar lo que pasa en nuestras
[1:14:05] vidas.
[1:14:08] Si tan solo pudiéramos creer eso,
[1:14:10] hermano Samuel.
[1:14:10] Hermano Samuel,
[1:14:11] si pudiéramos creer eso,
[1:14:17] Dios hará lo imposible.
[1:14:20] Él moverá
[1:14:23] en una en algo sobrenatural.
[1:14:27] Los doctores ni siquiera tendrán
[1:14:29] respuesta.
[1:14:31] Cuando se terminan tus finanzas,
[1:14:35] Dios proveerá.
[1:14:38] Así es.
[1:14:40] Cree y confía en Dios.
[1:14:43] No creas en tus propias habilidades.
[1:14:46] No creas en tu dinero.
[1:14:49] No confíes en qué tan inteligente eres.
[1:14:53] Hermano Víctor, no confiemos en qué tan
[1:14:55] inteligentes somos.
[1:14:57] Tenemos que confiar en lo que Dios dijo.
[1:15:03] Tenemos que confiar en lo que Dios ha
[1:15:05] dicho.
[1:15:09] Eso es la diferencia.
[1:15:12] Nuestra fe
[1:15:14] no lo niega,
[1:15:17] no niega la situación que estamos
[1:15:19] atravesando. Nuestra fe declara
[1:15:26] que Dios es más grande que nuestra
[1:15:28] situación.
[1:15:30] Nuestra fe
[1:15:33] pone la confianza en Dios.
[1:15:37] Pone la confianza en Dios y en su
[1:15:39] palabra.
[1:15:40] No en el hermano Félix,
[1:15:43] no en el hermano Tito,
[1:15:45] no en el que está predicando.
[1:15:47] Cuando su fe, iglesia,
[1:15:51] tiene que estar confiada en Dios.
[1:15:55] Ahí es donde su fe empieza a trabajar.
[1:15:58] Cuando usted no confía en su propia
[1:16:00] carne,
[1:16:02] ahí es donde Dios puede mover montañas.
[1:16:06] Dios puede ayudarte por el desierto.
[1:16:09] Te puede ayudar por el desierto.
[1:16:13] Ese es el mismo Dios
[1:16:15] que abrió el Mar Rojo,
[1:16:20] que provió fe a Abraham.
[1:16:25] Eso fue lo mismo que pasó con María,
[1:16:29] el mismo Dios que estaba con María,
[1:16:32] el mismo Dios que estaba con Jesús.
[1:16:36] Estaba leyendo algo ayer
[1:16:40] y este este muchacho lo describe de esta
[1:16:42] manera.
[1:16:44] Dice, dijo,
[1:16:47] cuando Pedro caminó sobre las aguas,
[1:16:53] confió en Dios.
[1:16:56] Tal vez hubiera podido brincarse ayer en
[1:16:57] el agua
[1:17:00] y hubiera podido agarrarse del barco,
[1:17:03] pero él confió en la palabra de Dios.
[1:17:07] Si tan solo pudiéramos confiar en la
[1:17:08] palabra de Dios,
[1:17:11] él puede hacer mucho, hermanos.
[1:17:21] Cuando tenemos fe,
[1:17:25] estamos colocados en terrenos más altos
[1:17:28] porque Dios es más grande.
[1:17:31] Él es un Dios sobrenatural.
[1:17:34] Todos los otros dioses de este mundo
[1:17:37] están en la tierra, están muertos, pero
[1:17:40] nuestro Dios
[1:17:42] todavía sigue viviendo en esta noche.
[1:17:45] Si hay alguien que lo puede decir en
[1:17:46] esta noche,
[1:17:49] "Mi Dios todavía vive.
[1:17:52] Mi Dios todavía está aquí.
[1:17:55] Yo no sirvo a un Dios muerto,
[1:17:58] [Aplausos]
[1:17:59] sirvo a un Dios vivo.
[1:18:02] Vamos, iglesia, lo quiero escuchar.
[1:18:07] Alguien puede decir, "Sirvo a un Dios
[1:18:09] vivo.
[1:18:12] Él me ayudará no importando la
[1:18:14] circunstancia."
[1:18:16] Hermano, Tito, Dios me va a ayudar, no
[1:18:18] importando qué,
[1:18:20] no importando qué le estoy batallando,
[1:18:24] no importa qué tan feo se viene el
[1:18:26] camino,
[1:18:28] Dios habrará un camino.
[1:18:32] Si hay alguien que lo pueda creer en
[1:18:33] esta noche,
[1:18:35] hay alguien que pueda decirle amén a la
[1:18:37] palabra.
[1:18:40] [Aplausos]
[1:18:42] Aleluya.
[1:18:44] Aleluya.
[1:18:46] No importando que estemos enfrentando en
[1:18:48] esta noche, Dios le va a ayudar a pasar
[1:18:51] eso.
[1:18:53] El hermano Branam dice eso.
[1:18:59] No importa las circunstancias
[1:19:02] en cualquier otra cosa.
[1:19:04] Uno no cuestiona la palabra de Dios.
[1:19:08] Uno solamente la cree,
[1:19:12] solamente la puede creer, iglesia,
[1:19:16] no importando lo que esté pasando, crea
[1:19:19] en Dios.
[1:19:26] Mire, su carne solamente mide lo que
[1:19:28] usted alcanza a ver,
[1:19:31] lo que sentimos,
[1:19:33] lo que entendemos.
[1:19:36] Pero al otro lado,
[1:19:39] al otro lado de la carne,
[1:19:43] hay un Dios sobrenatural
[1:19:46] que nos ha dado fe,
[1:19:48] nos ha dado todo.
[1:19:52] Dios no está limitado.
[1:19:55] Dios no está limitado por el tiempo.
[1:19:58] No se le acaba los recursos a Dios.
[1:20:01] Él no se le acaba los milagros a Dios.
[1:20:05] No se le acaba de las habilidades.
[1:20:08] A él nunca se le acaba nada. ¿Sabe por
[1:20:10] qué?
[1:20:13] Porque servimos a un Dios infinito.
[1:20:17] Creemos en un Dios vivo.
[1:20:20] Servimos a un Dios de milagros.
[1:20:24] ¿Sabe por qué?
[1:20:28] Porque él es el mismo de hoy, de ayer y
[1:20:30] por todos los siglos.
[1:20:32] El mismo Dios.
[1:20:34] Él siempre está viviendo.
[1:20:40] Si los músicos pueden pasar.
[1:20:44] Aleluya. Aleluya.
[1:20:47] Lo que se siente imposible para nosotros
[1:20:51] es tan simple,
[1:20:53] es un simple, una simple materia
[1:20:57] para Dios poder trabajar.
[1:21:01] Yo creo
[1:21:03] que él puede trabajar con nosotros,
[1:21:05] iglesia, si tan solo podemos creer.
[1:21:09] Si tan solo puedes creer en eso, eso es
[1:21:12] todo lo que necesitamos.
[1:21:14] Si tan solo podemos creer en eso,
[1:21:19] no tenga ninguna duda, iglesia.
[1:21:21] Puede estar enfermo,
[1:21:24] puede tal vez sin dinero, no tener
[1:21:26] dinero,
[1:21:28] tal vez sus oraciones no han sido
[1:21:29] contestadas,
[1:21:33] pero él está aquí en esta noche.
[1:21:36] Él sabe y conoce lo que usted está
[1:21:38] atravesando.
[1:21:41] El hermano Branham dice este extracto,
[1:21:42] dice,
[1:21:45] "Hermano mío,
[1:21:47] no tema
[1:21:50] a pedirle a Dios cualquier cosa.
[1:21:53] Usted debe exigirle a Dios.
[1:21:56] Pídale a Dios
[1:21:59] todo
[1:22:01] lo que él haya prometido.
[1:22:04] Iglesia, él lo ha prometido.
[1:22:09] Él puede hacer algo sobrenatural en esta
[1:22:11] noche.
[1:22:13] [Música]
[1:22:19] Aleluya.
[1:22:22] Tal vez
[1:22:25] has estado batallándole con algo,
[1:22:29] tal vez has estado luchando con algo.
[1:22:40] Tú siempre me escuchas decir esto.
[1:22:46] No sé lo que tú estás pasando
[1:22:50] y esa es la realidad.
[1:22:53] Yo no sé lo que tú estás atravesando,
[1:22:58] pero Dios sabe exactamente lo que tú
[1:23:00] estás pasando.
[1:23:02] Él sabe lo que tú le estás batallando.
[1:23:06] Él sabe qué batalla le estás batallando,
[1:23:10] qué enfermedad estás batallando.
[1:23:14] Sabe, él sabe lo que te duele.
[1:23:17] Él sabe lo que tú le estás dudando a él.
[1:23:22] Él sabe lo que te está doliendo a ti.
[1:23:28] Aleluya.
[1:23:33] Aleluya.
[1:23:37] Su presencia está aquí en esta noche,
[1:23:39] iglesia.
[1:23:47] Él puede remover y quitar cualquier
[1:23:50] duda.
[1:23:55] Él es un Dios sobrenatural.

[2:01:35] de consolador.
[2:01:54] I understand
[2:01:57] now in the of God not one more
[2:02:05] the Lord of
[2:02:08] the king of
[2:02:10] my heart
[2:02:13] in the all
[2:02:20] the
[2:02:21] afaré
[2:02:25] mi corazón
[2:02:29] alabará
[2:02:31] a mi Señor y Dios,
[2:02:34] al Rey de amor.
[2:02:37] En la tierra de paz
[2:02:39] yo entenderé
[2:02:42] que a tu pueblo salvó y aunque aquí
[2:02:44] sufrió, en mano no puede última vez mi
[2:02:48] corazón.
[2:02:52] El Señor a mi Señor y Dios,
[2:02:56] al Rey de amor
[2:02:58] en la tierra de paz
[2:03:01] yo entenderé.
[2:03:04] Y a su pueblo salvó y aquí sufrió el
[2:03:07] vano no fe.
[2:03:10] Amén. Aleluya,
[2:03:12] aleluya,
[2:03:14] aleluya,
[2:03:15] aleluya,
[2:03:16] aleluya,
[2:03:18] aleluya.
[2:03:20] [Aplausos]
[2:03:27] Aleluya.
[2:03:29] Aleluya.
[2:03:31] Hay victoria.
[2:03:34] Hay victoria,
[2:03:36] hay victoria.
[2:03:39] Amén. Aleluya.
[2:03:42] Amén. Amén.
[2:03:43] Amén. Amén.
[2:03:46] ¿Sabe?
[2:03:48] Le voy a dar una
[2:03:50] un hint. ¿Cómo se dice?
[2:03:53] Le voy a dar una ayuda.
[2:03:59] Tiene que usted
[2:04:02] saber
[2:04:04] de que usted ya es un ganador.
[2:04:08] No importa qué pase,
[2:04:11] no importa qué suceda,
[2:04:14] ya somos ganadores.
[2:04:17] Tenemos a Dios con nosotros.
[2:04:20] Todo va a salir bien,
[2:04:23] todo está bien.
[2:04:25] Entonces, deberíamos de saber eso
[2:04:29] y actuar
[2:04:31] como si ya Dios nos dio lo que estábamos
[2:04:34] esperando.
[2:04:37] Una de las maneras que ponemos nuestra
[2:04:40] fe a actuar
[2:04:43] en acción
[2:04:44] es de que actuamos
[2:04:47] o hacemos
[2:04:49] como si ya tenemos
[2:04:52] lo que estamos pidiendo.
[2:04:56] Así que si Dios ya le dio lo que usted
[2:04:59] ya ha estado pidiendo,
[2:05:01] usted puede adorarle,
[2:05:03] usted puede declarar victoria,
[2:05:06] usted puede decir, "Gracias, Señor."
[2:05:09] Usted no tiene por qué estar triste o
[2:05:12] dudando.
[2:05:14] Usted ya lo mira.
[2:05:17] Esa es la fe.
[2:05:20] Esa es la fe. ¿Sabes? No tengo duda en
[2:05:22] mi corazón
[2:05:24] que Dios colocó estos servicios para
[2:05:26] nosotros.
[2:05:28] Dios dijo, "Mis hijos necesitan algo.
[2:05:32] Mis hijos necesitan más de mí. Mis hijos
[2:05:35] necesitan liberación.
[2:05:37] Mis hijos necesitan de su Espíritu
[2:05:39] Santo. Mis hijos están pidiendo por un
[2:05:42] nuevo nacimiento.
[2:05:44] Así que voy a darles
[2:05:46] lo que ellos están pidiendo.
[2:05:48] [Aplausos]
[2:05:51] Yo vengo decidido
[2:05:53] a zambullirme en el agua
[2:05:57] todos los servicios.
[2:05:59] Yo no estoy esperando un servicio.
[2:06:02] Yo voy a aprovechar cada uno de ellos.
[2:06:06] Porque yo sé que en cualquier momento él
[2:06:10] va a responder.
[2:06:12] Él va a responder
[2:06:14] porque ya lo ha hecho
[2:06:17] y él lo va a seguir haciendo.
[2:06:20] La Biblia dice que somos la iglesia,
[2:06:24] usted y yo somos la iglesia
[2:06:27] que iba a prevalecer.
[2:06:30] Diga, voy a prevalecer.
[2:06:33] Somos la iglesia. que íbamos a
[2:06:36] prevalecer
[2:06:38] en contra del reino de Satanás.
[2:06:42] No estoy esperando otra iglesia,
[2:06:46] no estoy esperando otro mensaje, no
[2:06:48] estoy esperando otra revelación.
[2:06:51] Yo sé que esta es la revelación
[2:06:54] que va a prevalecer
[2:06:56] en contra del enemigo.
[2:06:58] Yo sé que esta es la iglesia.
[2:07:01] Yo sé que estos son los jóvenes. Yo sé
[2:07:04] que estos son los hombres y mujeres de
[2:07:06] Dios
[2:07:08] que van a prevalecer.
[2:07:11] Vamos a prevalecer
[2:07:14] en contra del enemigo.
[2:07:19] Nosotros no somos
[2:07:22] de los que le damos la vuelta al
[2:07:26] No somos de los que le huyos a Satanás.
[2:07:31] Vamos a prevalecer
[2:07:33] y estamos determinados
[2:07:36] hasta que lo miremos
[2:07:38] debajo de nuestros pies.
[2:07:41] [Aplausos]
[2:07:45] ¿Cuántos saben que usted es parte de esa
[2:07:46] iglesia?
[2:07:49] Somos llamados
[2:07:51] para echar fuera demonios.
[2:07:53] Somos llamados para poner las manos
[2:07:56] sobre los enfermos y ellos sanarían.
[2:08:00] Somos llamados para tener el Espíritu
[2:08:03] Santo. Somos llamados para vivir una
[2:08:06] vida victoriosa.
[2:08:12] No, no el pastor,
[2:08:14] no el ministro,
[2:08:16] no a alguien más. Diga, "Yo yo soy
[2:08:20] llamado para eso."
[2:08:23] Amén. Aleluya. Aleluya.
[2:08:28] El está
[2:08:30] molesto.
[2:08:32] Él tiene miedo.
[2:08:35] Tiene miedo
[2:08:37] porque hemos estado pasando buenos
[2:08:40] tiempos con Dios
[2:08:43] y déjeme decirle, solo se va a poner más
[2:08:45] bueno.
[2:08:47] Y el tiene miedo
[2:08:51] porque nos ha enviado de todo,
[2:08:55] pero aquí estamos todavía.
[2:08:58] Nos ha usado todas las armas en su
[2:09:00] artillería,
[2:09:03] pero aquí estamos todavía
[2:09:05] y estamos más fuertes que antes.
[2:09:09] Estamos más dispuestos que antes.
[2:09:12] Así que, iglesia,
[2:09:14] vamos fuerte.
[2:09:17] Vamos fuerte.
[2:09:19] Amén. Aleluya.
[2:09:21] Yo sé que vamos a mirar grandes cosas.
[2:09:24] Ya, ya comenzamos.
[2:09:26] Ya comenzamos a mirar grandes cosas.
[2:09:29] Dios bendiga la palabra. Pueden tomar
[2:09:30] sus lugares. Discúlpenme.
[2:09:34] Amén. Ahí.
[2:09:36] Amén.
[2:09:39] Dios bendiga la palabra.
[2:09:42] Qué palabra, ¿verdad?
[2:09:45] Yo me gocé con cada una de ellas.
[2:09:48] [Música]
[2:09:50] La fe de María.
[2:09:54] La fe de María.
[2:10:00] ¿Cuántos se identifican con María?
[2:10:09] ¿Sabe, estamos en una situación muy
[2:10:11] similar a la de María?
[2:10:15] Nadie ha vivido lo que lo que estamos
[2:10:17] viviendo ahora.
[2:10:20] Estamos viviendo en la peor edad, en el
[2:10:23] peor momento.
[2:10:25] Y y es en este tiempo
[2:10:28] donde vamos a hacer algo que nadie ha
[2:10:29] hecho.
[2:10:32] Nadie ha hecho. Una novia va a ser
[2:10:36] transformada.
[2:10:38] Su cuerpo natural
[2:10:40] va a ser transformada.
[2:10:43] de algo corruptible
[2:10:45] a algo incorruptible.
[2:10:48] Nosotros nos estamos preparando
[2:10:51] para recibir al Dios eterno en el aire.
[2:10:56] Oh, déjeme decirle, yo creo que Dios
[2:10:59] tiene la fe de María
[2:11:01] aún aquí en este tiempo,
[2:11:05] en usted y en mí.
[2:11:07] A veces pensamos que no somos
[2:11:08] suficientes,
[2:11:11] pero Dios pensó suficiente en nosotros
[2:11:15] para enviarnos en este tiempo,
[2:11:18] llamarnos a este mensaje
[2:11:20] para creer esta palabra para esta hora.
[2:11:25] Y si él creyó en nosotros,
[2:11:28] yo creo en nosotros, yo creo en mí.
[2:11:32] Yo creo en que Dios me ha dado
[2:11:35] lo que necesito
[2:11:38] para traer su palabra manifestación.
[2:11:43] ¿Cuántos lo creen, iglesia?
[2:11:47] Vamos a Bueno, yo puedo seguir
[2:11:49] predicando,
[2:11:50] pero yo sé que algunos tienen que ir a
[2:11:52] trabajar
[2:11:54] y este vamos a vamos a ser despedidos.
[2:11:59] Mañana las puertas se abran a las 6:30.
[2:12:04] Va a haber oración de 6:30 7
[2:12:08] para que guste venir a prepararse más.
[2:12:13] Ah, vamos a escuchar palabras de nuestro
[2:12:15] hermano Branham de las 7 a las 7:10
[2:12:20] y el servicio comienza a las 7:15.
[2:12:25] Hay que disfrutar estos últimos 7 días.
[2:12:29] Miren, el año
[2:12:32] bien bien va a venir fuerte
[2:12:37] y lo que hagamos ahorita,
[2:12:39] lo que hagamos ahorita
[2:12:41] va a determinar
[2:12:44] [Música]
[2:12:46] cómo vamos a pelear este año,
[2:12:49] si lo vamos a pelear con muchas fuerzas
[2:12:54] o vamos a estar medios deiluchos.
[2:12:58] Hay que aprovecharlo.
[2:13:02] No va a tener otra oportunidad como esta
[2:13:03] en el año.
[2:13:07] Aprovéchelo.
[2:13:09] La limitación no es Dios.
[2:13:12] La limitación es somos nosotros.
[2:13:16] ¿Me están escuchando? Iglesia. La
[2:13:18] limitación no es Dios.
[2:13:21] Él no se está limitando para nosotros.
[2:13:24] Él no se está limitando para usted,
[2:13:29] está en nosotros.
[2:13:32] Creámosle.
[2:13:34] Y hay que aprovechar estos días y haga
[2:13:37] algo diferente.
[2:13:39] Salga de su zona de conforte,
[2:13:42] haga algo que no ha hecho.
[2:13:45] Adórele como nunca le ha adorado.
[2:13:48] La la adoración tiene efecto también.
[2:13:52] Así como su fe tiene efecto, la
[2:13:54] adoración levanta su fe.
[2:13:57] La adoración la ayuda,
[2:14:00] lo acerca más a Dios.
[2:14:03] Adórele. No espere los sentimientos.
[2:14:07] Adórele desde su corazón,
[2:14:10] no desde sus sentimientos.
[2:14:12] Adórele desde su corazón.
[2:14:15] Si hay algo en su corazón, por Dios,
[2:14:18] sáquelo.
[2:14:20] Sáquelo. La Biblia dice que aquellos
[2:14:22] santos sacaron fuerza de la debilidad.
[2:14:28] A veces parece que no hay nada allí,
[2:14:30] pero créame, allí está.
[2:14:33] Créame, allí está. Si no, no estaríamos
[2:14:37] aquí.
[2:14:38] A veces parece que no hay nada ahí,
[2:14:41] pero ahí está.
[2:14:46] Sáquelo.
[2:14:48] [Música]
[2:14:52] La Biblia dice que levantemos manos
[2:14:55] santas a él.
[2:14:58] Es palabra de Dios que levante sus
[2:14:59] manos.
[2:15:01] Es palabra de Dios que le adore. La
[2:15:03] Biblia dice, "Todo lo que respire adore
[2:15:06] al Señor."
[2:15:08] ¿Cuántos están respirando en esta mañana
[2:15:09] en esta tarde?
[2:15:13] Vamos. Mire, si usted cumple la palabra,
[2:15:17] Dios cumple la palabra también.
[2:15:20] Usted solamente ríndase a su palabra
[2:15:24] y él lo va a hacer.
[2:15:27] Amén. Los niños y dice los niños y
[2:15:30] después hermana Lisa tienen práctica de
[2:15:31] canto al terminar el servicio. Por favor
[2:15:33] quedarse en sus asientos y no salir.
[2:15:39] Y nuestra hermana Gisela Saedo de Silao
[2:15:43] dice, "Pido oración por nuestro hermano
[2:15:44] Cosme Aguirre para que nuestro Señor y
[2:15:47] Salvador Jesucristo le dé su sanidad y
[2:15:50] lo fortalezca.
[2:15:54] [Música]
[2:16:00] Vamos a ponernos de pie
[2:16:02] despedidos.
[2:16:07] Dele gracias a Dios.
[2:16:09] Como decían nuestros hermanos,
[2:16:11] testifique,
[2:16:13] testifique
[2:16:15] de lo que Dios
[2:16:17] está haciendo.
[2:16:19] Él ya está obrando,
[2:16:22] él ya está trabajando.
[2:16:25] Vamos aar nuestro rostro y vamos a orar
[2:16:29] y darle gracias a Dios.

[2:16:46] porque tus hijos están aquí, son
[2:16:48] especiales.
[2:16:52] Muchos hemos entrado ya en el espíritu
[2:16:56] y sabemos que tú tienes el control de
[2:16:59] todo.
[2:17:01] Estamos en expectativa en estos
[2:17:03] servicios
[2:17:06] porque cualquier cosa puede suceder.
[2:17:10] Si alguno no ha recibido su liberación,
[2:17:14] este es su año.
[2:17:17] Si alguno está esperando su sanidad,
[2:17:20] este es su año.
[2:17:23] Y estamos confiando porque tú eres el
[2:17:24] Dios de lo imposible
[2:17:28] en el poderoso gran conquistador
[2:17:31] que es el Señor Jesucristo.
[2:17:34] Y estamos en expectativa una vez más.
[2:17:38] Te pedimos también que bendigas las
[2:17:39] manos que están levantadas,
[2:17:43] que tú cumplas sus peticiones, sus
[2:17:45] deseos
[2:17:47] de su corazón
[2:17:49] y nos ponemos en tus manos,
[2:17:53] sabiendo que tú eres el Dios del ayer,
[2:17:55] de hoy y de siempre.

[2:18:02] en expectativa
[2:18:04] y de antemano ya estamos agradecidos por
[2:18:06] lo que tú estás haciendo
[2:18:09] y lo que vas a hacer.
[2:18:12] Ahora te pedimos que bendigas a nuestra
[2:18:14] hermana que está en Silao,
[2:18:17] que cumpla su petición
[2:18:20] porque creemos en un Dios de sanidades,
[2:18:24] de milagros
[2:18:25] y cualquier cosa puede suceder.
[2:18:28] Auméntanos más la fe
[2:18:31] para creerte,
[2:18:34] porque tú puedes hacer todo,
[2:18:37] solamente que te creamos.
[2:18:40] dijo el profeta,
[2:18:42] todo es posible si puedes creer.
[2:18:46] Y te pedimos que ayudes a nuestra
[2:18:47] hermana allá donde está
[2:18:50] y te damos gracias de antemano por todo.
[2:18:54] A los que nos miran por medio del
[2:18:56] internet,
[2:18:57] sabemos que ellos también pueden recibir
[2:18:59] allá lo que ellos están pidiendo.
[2:19:03] Y antemano ya estamos agradecidos
[2:19:07] porque todo lo que pasa
[2:19:10] es con un propósito
[2:19:12] y el propósito
[2:19:13] es formar carácter,
[2:19:16] carácter cristiano, y todas las cosas
[2:19:19] nos ayudan para bien
[2:19:21] para tus hijos. Entonces, te damos
[2:19:24] gracias por toda la ayuda
[2:19:26] y nos ponemos en tus manos.
[2:19:29] Todo esto te lo pedimos y te damos
[2:19:31] gracias en el nombre del Señor
[2:19:33] Jesucristo.
[2:19:35] Amén. Estamos despedidos.

[2:19:45] Quiero estar bien poco en mi conforte
[2:19:47] porque todavía no he acabado de alabarle
[2:19:48] a mi Dios.
[2:19:53] No importa lo que venga a hacer,
[2:19:56] no importa lo que el mundo diga.
[2:19:58] Lo que yo sé
[2:20:01] [Música]

[2:21:09] lo dio, no me lo puede quitar. Como no

[2:21:15] gozo, oh, el gozo que siento yo, el
[2:21:20] mundo no me lo dio. El mundo no me lo
[2:21:24] dio. Y como no me lo dio, no me lo puede
[2:21:26] quitar. Como no me lo dio, no me lo
[2:21:29] puede quitar.
