to that because we worship him because he lives in our hearts because when we're in need he is our present help he fulfills his word and we're happy for that right Brothers God has been good to us if you would just please stand foreign verse 5. the word of God says the following Hermano you have it Brothers this is mind being you which was also in Christ Jesus Dios noise who've been in for in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God mismo for Madison Los Hombres made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and we'll present ourselves before our creator Celestial Heavenly Father this morning we come before your presence God is the reason why we are here it's because of your grace we live in another day because of your grace if you just help us offer the best that is in our hearts insufficient you know we are insufficient that's why we come before you know to ask of your help Lord Miss Hermanos if you'd allow that my brothers not see this flesh because they would see you Lord is nobody that's your word Lord that is everything one word of mine no significance but just one of your words that is eternal aside amen amen I'm just trying to to just calm down Brothers and we're happy to be in this place hey is we are fighting the same five brothers the same as the same battles the same trials but we also have the same God that helps us towards us isn't that right now I'm going to read the scripture once again just follow me let us mind being you which was also in Christ what we're feeling was there in Christ Jesus Watch what it says but made himself of no reputation how many this morning want to just uh let go of yourself because God despair not God didn't think about it was the god of Eternity he was the creator of everything no doubt everything obeyed him his creation was proud of him notice Brothers [Music] he would go through where the trees were is that tree felt a great way notice Brothers you feel this morning where two or three were gathered he would be in here in their midst there's not a devil that could stand before you there's not a sickness foreign like him that's right isn't that right Brothers k a question this is the day this is the moment that we need to be like him you know you're on a pistol or a letter there are people in the world they take no interest and taking hold of a Bible come on now man that's right you talk to them about the Bible and they say and what do you say it's a waste of time they see a Bible in the form of Flesh a great way in the lives of men o isn't that right Brothers in other words you're very life not just in our church not just with our own also at our jobs I want to title this message letting go of ourselves how many want to let go of yourselves the chairman of War Brothers of our ideas of our way of seeing the Bible we want to see it Through The Eyes Of God foreign he wants to know where we're standing because we are about the effects on the way how many I know that Brothers of all times of the church so so it's it's convenient for us to know where we're standing you know the messenger says there's something that's going to show us where we're standing it's this book that says what's this word something that's going to show you and I yes sir now there's a lot of books that can be real buenos that could be good now that Contra is home nothing against that but we have the Assurance this book is completely the truth right Brothers amen amen glory to God now do you know God left us the example remember Brothers letting go of ourselves but when we let go of ourselves we have to fill ourselves with something so there has to be a pouring out so has to be a Feeling what are you feeling yourself with foreign yourself out but we have to be careful Brothers of what are we filling ourselves with you know and we this this hour we have a great example is Jesus Christ he's not a better model to follow Persona there's not a better person we can name many prophets we have to go to the peak a river to of the higher the messenger dios Jesus Christ he said when when God sent Jesus Christ he sent them in order for him to be our role model we're not going to enter into that subject because there's other people that take different Role Models even even Christians but remember Brothers when God said Jesus Christ he said to him so that he would be his Role Models when he reflected his life through the word he told us what we should be notice Brothers yourself in the mirror do you see a man that's going directly into the right because in this hour brother identified with him her brother Isaac was saying six years ago that he said it's later than we think 60 years back Brothers what about today you need to live a life Brothers if he were to come this morning how much would how many would raise their hands how many would raise their hand yeah because he is our example and we want to identify with him and Manu with chariots could have come with angels could have put everything on his feet [Music] the angel would be there everything obeyed him come on how should we repay that love just think about what I'm saying with the life that we're that we have come up with yes how could we repay that love Hermano and don't say so what example did he leave us how would our life reflect notice Brothers he spared not his whole Kingdom let's go to that to that picture you could have come Brothers with the Legion of angels but what did he say he says the fox that doesn't have a hole Hermano Lotus Brothers now how should we be Hermano study just ask yourself you know what he did you let go of how great he was let go of the crown he came in the way of a Manger that was his love towards you yes the Lord that humbled itself to the lowest thing in order to give you life now in order to to let go of character is required in order to let go of yourself a character is required it's in his character look at yourself what type of character do you have because we're letting go have you become like him Hermano um have you become like him this is you could stand before the presence of God or could we stand before the presence of God there's not a way to do it wow there's just one way to do it the perfect sacrifice Hermano but with our own works we recognize the works of the Lord Jesus Christ that sacrifice that was accepted he himself says this is my beloved Son and whom I am well please so what do you have to do you have to accept the person of Jesus Christ there has to be a death in order for you to bring life notice Brothers letting go of ourselves how many want to let go of yourselves [Music] you know in him there was no blemish there was nothing that he could be accused of it he would stand before the intellectual people for the people that that knew about the gospel and he would say who can't blame me of sin is but yet even saying those words he suffered so much like like just like any man he was despised he was mocked he was persecuted and the question is what did he do aliens okay stand before him and point a finger at him they wanted to have something right you don't think they would have filled their mouths there was accusations he was letting go of himself foreign Hermano no serrated maybe he scratches our head with us as well yes here is he not Hermano yeah now we can't produce that character Hermano Wright brothers or a church can't give it to us Hermano who created a Creed can't do it a denomination can't do it we can't obtain it through education there has to be a verse for you to have the character of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so that's when you allow him to enter Then you become Sons and Daughters of God notice Brothers now let's analyze a point notice Brothers because we're learning of that character because if we are emptying ourselves out then we have to fill ourselves with something right we have to analyze the character of our Lord Jesus Christ what did he do know his throne he took form of a servantes characteristics it behooves us to uh to to look at those characteristics and apply them to our lives now when uh when Christ went up to Golgotha he had been mistreated he had been whipped he had he had been a crushed and you know why they did that in order he allowed those things he said that's how they had the devil confused right brother amen is he or is he not no point it can't be God would not allow this God wouldn't allow it and those soldiers slapping them put a crown of thorns upon himself the word says He was taken to the salon what did he do he he spoke not he did not open his mouth and me [Applause] the devil was confused if he were God he wouldn't allow this notice Brothers but many people weren't aware or conscious of what they were doing to Jesus you know many people many people are not aware of what they're doing to the word they're not aware Brothers the devil didn't believe that it was Emmanuel come up just think about this Brothers How could a great Creator stand is allow somebody to to slap him [Music] uh what would you have done brother what would you have done sister if someone were to come and just boom just think Brothers that's what brother Branham says that the devil did not understand and he asked himself the questions if this were God how would he allow this right what was he doing notice the obedience could you imagine Jesus as a baby the god of Eternity come on baby as a baby could you imagine him as a as a child just think Brothers could you imagine him as as an adolescent could you imagine him as a Young Man in complete obedience to the word Hermano yes there's no excuse to be surrendered to be not do not be surrendered to the word of God brother did you could we imagine him how could he allow these soldiers Brothers to to to to slap him let's look at the scene on one side of him over here being slapped they're in that place that's been not slapped and the devil on this side Miranda looking like this and then he's just going like this Hermano is does he scratch his head with us if you're the prophet then tell us who is possibly we might believe you know but you know what he did he opened not his mouth brother he didn't open it at all I had Satan confused oh that can't be wow local piano they they whipped him they they uh the school they scorched him you know the children of God they they withstand everything and they're the perfect will of God you can bear anything just like he did over there this morning as long as you know in the perfect will of God man amen thank you thank you Lord glory to God there are many brothers they don't tolerate for anything to be done to them you can't even tolerate a bad gesture oh he's going to pay me he's going to know who I am right Brothers oh he hit my child right Brothers we have to see ourselves in the mirror of his word Brothers he let go of himself and took form of a servant what does the servant do said he surrenders his rights is that the lamb is lead no who jumped off to the side [Music] notice Brothers many times we don't want to be told anything we don't know we don't allow ourselves to be slapped around oh no I'm not speaking about anybody in particular basis the ministers get up here they speak a certain things he said oh they most certainly must have told him oh he already found out right Brothers time is running but we have to stand in the mirror of of the word if you just please stand I'll be finishing with this glory to God help us Satan icion and seeing the mission of our Lord Jesus Christ the submission of our Lord Jesus Christ he was confused well the scourging of him they did nothing we put a crown of thorns on him and still nothing we can't get him out of his wits mine Lincoln we put a spear on his to his side as though he was he was he was uh he was mute now that is he wouldn't say anything it's quite possible I could imagine this the Satan wanted to use to pull his last card imagine him the devil speaks to his last card [Music] come here [Music] did you know you're under my orders there goes that man headed toward Golgotha labras his word is is uh exhausted nobody believes in him [Music] it can't be God Ultimo ultimate would you go go over there and just give him the last touch could you do that work Hermano right Brothers he was before the eyes everybody finished the the teacher walking like this in the wings of Death Around the Lord Jesus Christ yeah because Hermano notice Brothers Australia up to the point that the Lord Jesus went for you and I told the local support everything he was able to bear for you and me he left his throne he he left his his uh his servants where he would go through there was Caravans there were songs there was worship but he saw you lost [Music] and he spared none of that [Music] he put it on the balance foreign [Music] he took the form of man [Music] due to the love of you and me
