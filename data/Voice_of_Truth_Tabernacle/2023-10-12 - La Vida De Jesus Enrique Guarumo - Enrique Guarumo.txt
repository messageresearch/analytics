you this evening Brothers It's a privilege to be able to be here amongst you my name is enri warum I came I come from Las Cruses by the grace of God Brothers uh we serve the Lord when this opportunity is given or we just take advantage of it I'm G ask you where the clock is um we're going to be talking about a character that is very special to me it's his name is Jesus there's one here that needs him or would possibly want to know him more then be attented to the word of God for me it's been of a great blessing I'm going to read in the book of Isaiah chapter 53 reading verse three what I'm gonna be speaking this evening the majority of what you'll be hearing you'll find it in the message the crty of sin and the price and the penalty that had to be paid to read it from our lives scripture says like this verse he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us Soul he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as the Sheep before shears is dumb so he open openeth not his mouth let us pray heav father at this hour we have read your word asking Lord of your blessing that you would go to every heart that would not be my words Lord that it would be your word Lord giving life Lord father we put ourselves in your hands expecting that your grace would accomp us this evening and we put ourselves in your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Brothers um when I think about Jesus I believe it's the found of every Christian if you have problems just look at Jesus because we can learn very much from him he is the life uh so int to introduce a little bit about Jesus I'm going to go to that great event of the crucifixion and quite possibly Jesus got to a point where he had to make a decision just as we have to make decisions in our lives but Jesus got to a point [Music] Brothers where he began began to be in anguish because he he knew his hour had come and many times we as Christians we know our hour has come and brothers uh you get nervous in any circumstance Brothers you may possibly be a little fearful Jesus was in a moment a decisive moment for all humanity and he [Music] knew that due to this decision it it was not only going to depend on [Music] him but the the people were involved as well so him in these circumstances he went to goek for that place to pray and when he was there Brothers the Bible teaches us that he went into a profound prayer and in that prayer so many things happened and one of the things that happened there is that Jesus he wanted to abort the mission he said father if it if it were possible if there's somebody better than me let this cup pass from me the Bible says that Jesus stood up and he went to look at his disciples and he said Lord which one which one will take my place Jesus said no and they said he went back to prayer and he got up again and he said Lord he said father if it's possible amongst the 12 that are here if it were possible Jesus Jesus went back to prayer again and Jesus went back and he said Lord father may your will be done when Jesus was there Brothers he got into such a state that the Bible lets us know that he began to sweat drops of blood scientifically this process is called OSIS a condition where a person that is very nervous and he is fearful and he is he is scared the prophet says God had to let Jesus go to take this decision make this decision as a human being did you know Brothers there have been occasions where God is going to have to leave you not because God wants to the Bible teaches [Music] me that when the people of Israel were going to sacrifice the land they had to do it willfully that's why being a Christian it's not an obligation it's not CU my father or my mom tells me to be a Christian is something voluntary Jesus Jesus in such a condition the prophet tells us that that God turned his back Brothers in such an Agony and he praying oh and and he turned his back to him what would you do Brothers in Hebrews that although he was a son he had to learn obedience so Jesus in this uh condition if we uh take it to the place where they they they went the Bible teaches us that that uh the many soldiers had gone to go and and and go for one man we'll look at it through the scripture [Music] the Bible says that that Jesus's Fame began to go throughout Jerusalem there was a good Fame but there was also the ill Fame to the point where they began to think that that he was a he was a person that was a demonized he had he had the Devil Within him they got to think of such a thing that the people began to be fearful of him it seems like there's a witchcraft there so there was the a good Fame and then there was the bad fame or ill Fame like well how are we going to trap him because he has powers we've heard that he's resurrects the dead we've heard that he he walks he goes through walls how can we do it to to trap this person bring the best of the soldiers we're going to find the best weapons the priests came with them just just in case that they have to do a cast out some Demon you know Jesus already knew and in on that morning when they were going for Jesus Jesus went out to meet them and he asked uh who whom do you seek said they said Jesus and the Bible says that Jesus asked once again whom do you seek they said we seek Jesus he said he said I am he the Bible doesn't just say that it says when when he said I am [Music] he all all of the soldiers were taken back they all fell to the ground because that I am Brothers when Moses received the commission he said what do who do I tell them I am I am that I am there was the the main one great I am the one that isy God the Conqueror that's why when those words came out of no demon that can stand before those words he wanted to intended to let them know one thing that if he went to Calvary it wasn't because it was going to be something forceful brothers because if he was going to go to Calvary it was because of love Brothers if you have made the decision to be a Christian do it out of love when you do things out of love brother all of Heaven is backing you [Music] up all of the angels are at your disposition but Jesus brothers when they took him Brothers Jesus they took him and and and they took him and put him in a prison his friends had forsaken him if you perhaps one time have been in a prison or or or a place like that you know what it feels like to to be there uh it's lonely without friends but Jesus was there Brothers in that condition the Bible says that he he was in in anguish and he was afflicted yet he did not open his mouth like a lamb he was taken to the slaughter and and and like uh like a lamb was taken before the the shears and he opened not his mouth and he opened not his [Music] mouth Brothers sometimes we go through circumstances in [Music] life oh Brothers but why the brother this and and and not me why does God do this for him and not for me the Bible says that he he opened not his mouth the prophet of God tells us that Jesus could have told the disciples the future he said you know what Peter you're gonna go through this and and this but the prophet says that Jesus never told them the future in order to not discourage them because sometimes we're so worried we're like oh what's going to happen further ahead head and you'll find out the process that the disciples had to go through I'm go to one we're going to the Book of Psalms chapter 22 and David will Express to us a little more here about what happened there verse one verse one of Psalms chapter 22 I believe it was the spirit of God in David that's what brother BR said my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me do you see brothers that God won't always be there when you have to make a decision brothers and you feel like you've been you've been forsaken think upon the scure why are th so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh my God I cry in the daytime thou hearest not thou holy oh thou that inhabit the Praises of our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou did deliver them they Cried unto thee and were [Music] delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded but I am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lips they shake the head saying he trusted on the Lord that he would deliver let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him but thou are he that took me out of the womb that did make me hope when I was upon my mother's breast I was a cast upon thee from the world Thou Art my God from my oh how beautiful Brothers when you as a [Music] Christian whether God blesses you or not say God you have set you have but the womb of God knows you brother he knows your needs but what he doesn't want is to put your needs first and then him it's first it's God and then he'll take care of your needs blessed be the name of the Lord be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help many bulls have compassed me strong BS of B have sent me round they gaped upon me with their mouths as a raving and a roaring lion Brothers when the prophet narrates this there are certain things that that that really shake you up because when they took Jesus to that place Jesus was in a condition where the Bible says the Bulls of Bashan have beset me you know the capital punishment of that time is that first that they would beat the people and then they would CR crucify them when they took Jesus and they took him there to give him a lashing those people that were were they whipping Jesus the the the story says that they would take turns because not only one person would die it was a certain number of people and when Jesus's time came around if one person died in the hands of the one that was punishing them he would get a reward so those men when they were approaching to a to whip a a man they weren't just just uh swinging softly no no brothers they knew that if the person died in their turn they received a reward so they took those whips the prophet Des describes him it it was it they were like a cat [Music] cloths they were like a the barbed wire and when they would hit the body it it would tear the flesh when he they P so those men brothers anointed by Satan they knew who was there they knew that he would die and Satan brother he wanted to finish him off and they started to whip him and the Bible says let us read I am poured out like water and all my bones are out of my joint out of joint my heart is like Wax is melted in the midst of my bowels could you imagine Brothers those men trying to whip Jesus with all of their might oh Brothers says my strength is dried up like a a pot's herd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou has brought me into the dust of death for dogs have compassed me the Assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet I may tell all my b bones oh Brothers I could imagine that those those cat claws when they would hit the body and they would tear the pieces of [Music] Flesh that's why the Bible says I going tell all my bones but miraculous L Brothers Jesus continued living because Satan knew that if he finished him he would not be able to carry the cross but miraculous Jesus continued alive and he's not dead Brothers he is alive they part my garments among them and cast L upon my V but be thou not far from me oh Lord oh my strength haste thee to help me deliver my soul from the my darling from the power of [Music] God save me from the lion's mouth for thou has heard me from the horns of the UN will declare my name unto my bre in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee so this is letting us know one thing when Jesus arrived there he didn't arrive there complaining although his father was not there there there was no answer when he cried out it's not easy Brothers but those were the circumstances Jesus found himself in when Jesus arrived they took him to the Cross scientifically Brothers body has a nerve in its feet they say that when that nerve they they massage it well you could be healed from any sickness medically but when Jesus arrived there and they placed that that uh that nail upon that nerve he experimented the the harshest pain that the human being could experience and with all of that he opened not his mouth he opened not his mouth aren't you thankful with with God for that the prophet says Jesus could have used his pow did you know there was a legion of angels waiting the order of [Music] Jesus any Proclamation from Jesus those [Music] angels were at Jesus's disposition if he said something those angels would have helped him the prophet says that are in heaven the Angels were saying father what they will do to your [Music] son do you want us to go [Music] down and and bring us storms and annihilate them all no said no because he has to go alone remember there will be things you will have to do alone the majority of the time men of God they have to cry alone where no one hear sees them that was the condition of Jesus when he was there in Gethsemane crying out praying to the Lord Bible says that a legion of Angels Came to strengthen him said look in fours over there in four Callins there is a people that are waiting for your decision did you know the Bible says that Jesus knew all things Jesus knew you Brothers he knew about you Jesus felt alone he experimented loneliness just the same as you do he experimented pain the pain that you sometimes feel he felt it as well that's why the Bible was not mistaken when they said that he experimented so much that God constituted positioned him as a high priest for you and I because he he knows exactly how you feel because that's that's why he said if you need something ask it in my name because I know what you're feeling blessed be the name of the Lord when Jesus Jesus got to that position those angels came to strengthen him have you ever felt like that brother sometimes Maybe disappointed discouraged you feel something in your heart that speaks to you perhaps a call and one day there was such difficult circumstances I said Lord I know you dwell you dwell in the highest I was going through the center of a city in the middle of some you know when you get to a condition of sadness and pain what the devil wants and the first thing that he tells you is he says we'll just die it's easier problems are over with that's the first thing the devil tells us when I when I looked up I said Lord that building is very high and you know just imagine him falling from up there it would be easier than dealing with all these problems I said Lord but if you send two angels to help me simply just seeing them would be enough when I was there Brothers I I I I I put my head down but when I and I when I raised it up I saw my pastor coming over there from over there and he was with another Pastor y I said oh God said oh my God because God is so simple he is very simple he does things in Simplicity sometimes we are the ones that make them complicated but God is is is so simple when Jesus Brothers cried out he was there in the cross of calvary and then he experimented all things that a human being could experiment or go through the the the the sun did not give its light it was a very sad day but the thing that catches my attention of the disciples is that he had had told them he said men I have to go but on the third day I shall rise you know what the disciples did when they saw him over there crucified they thought that all hope was finished the prophet says that they became discouraged he said but you know what he they said oh it's all finished now I'm I'm gonna go fishing other said well Peter well we'll go with you too they crucified him on a Friday a Saturday they should have they should have been preparing themselves for Sunday because on Sunday he was going to resurrect should have been like oh should have been saying oh he promised that he he would resurrect on a sun on Sunday and where were they they were fishing the Bible says that on a Sunday morning those women uh woke up very early and the sun had come out and when they arrived there then Jesus had resurrected but Jesus was there was there in in in the grave or in the cemetery I imagine they greeted him good morning said good morning they went to go see the tomb and they didn't find him they went on this said uh sir what happened to the man that was right here the Bible says that they did not recognize him they they had confused him with with the guy that maintains the the cemer the grave or the one that that does the maintenance on and and they asked where did you put him Jesus said Mary she said a master that's why Brothers it's so important to learn to hear the voice of God because one day he's goingon to call you are going to have to answer that God would open our eyes for and we would understand and comprehend what God has for you and I those women Jesus told them go quickly and tell my disciples that I have resurrected what do you think happened Brothers went Jesus we've seen him he has resurrected the Bible says that they did not believe them they didn't believe that's why it's very different to be a Christian somebody professes that professes to be a Christian instead of and a genuine Christian a genuine Christian brother he he believes it even if he doesn't see it he believes it and if you notice when Jesus was there amongst them him even being there they said they could not believe it him them seeing him there they said that they couldn't believe it out of the joy sometimes I I understand what it is what the joy of the Lord is but sometimes we Rejoice so much that we don't believe why I have understood the one thing is the anointing and another thing is the truth did you know brothers that the anointing bring so many marvelous things and that's what what what makes it so lucrative the the the the religious system so because with the anointing Brothers you know what the the pastor does oh Brothers we need an offering for the Lord because he's under an anointing and and in the anointing look at Elijah Elijah was under an anointing and he killed 400 prophets but without the anointing he was running from a woman but the anointing Brothers the anointing Brothers for the title deed of your house Brothers but when the truth comes the truth establishes you it put you in a position position that's why this word Brothers they're they're prohibiting to even speak of Jesus because that name Brothers it's it's a blessing for the entire world just some people have made it so lucrative but there something that Jesus reproached to the disciples it was of their unbelief they said they said do not be unbelievers he told them be Believers because what God wants is Believers it doesn't matter the circumstances God needs people to believe him so you can say from now on I'm not going to complain Jesus said these words you without me can do nothing Brothers if you don't have Jesus it doesn't matter the efforts that you give or what you try to do you will not achieve it but if you have Jesus if you have Jesus Brothers this this evening Heaven is at your disposition don't be fearful brothers or scared the world is is is is turning upside down but the people that know their God they shall recognize and they shall act Jesus said when you see and this over here this happening here he said Rejoice Rejoice he said because your Redemption is n let's not be halfway Christians did you know that Peter stood before Jesus he said look Jesus it's NE Neary I'm going to die with you it's necessary I will die for you that was not God's plan Peter didn't know what he was saying so that time of trial came because as long as we're in a group Brothers as long as we're together we we we think we're pretty tough like the men young men when they're together they see a young lady Go by they they they think a whole lot of themselves but leave them alone what's your name Peter said I understand and know that you're the Christ the son of the Living God and I will stand for you be careful with your words brothers be careful you know why because the devil has already heard them here I come look the brother's doing so and so thing really Jesus said look Peter Satan I already talked how many speak how many the saint speak to sometimes you talk to Satan it's like you talk with God you need to talk with Satan to you read the message the prophet says tells tell the devil depart for me just like Jesus is the same yesterday Satan doesn't change his strategies either when uh Peter comes Jesus Jesus said I have I have prayed for you that your faith fail not that's what the Christian should not lack is Faith Peter he had good intentions but Christian is not measured by his good by his good intentions Peter took out his sword and said he said you die and Jesus Peter that's not how you do it the prophet said Jesus had to correct Peter's error how many times does God have to correct our errors when that time came Peter denied Jesus you know what happened with with that night Judas had had hung himself and that spirit that followed that that followed Judas it was following Peter to to so that he would hang himself you know what happened was that Peter didn't find a rope and he could not hang himself because he felt ashamed about what he had done difference between a genuine Christian brothers that he repents about what he's done he corrects his he departs from from Evil and he is able to obtain Mercy after that time Peter Brothers they were they were hid they were persecuted and and and and and trying to imprison them and they were uh they were fearful they were with fear and being and they were being there Clos in 10 days later come down presence of the Lord came down what happened the Holy Spirit started filling they were no longer afraid they could have went out the street uh truly all the house of
