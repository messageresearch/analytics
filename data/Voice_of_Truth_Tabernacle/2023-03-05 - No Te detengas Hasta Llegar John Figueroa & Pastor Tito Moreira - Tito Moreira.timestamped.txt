[48:47] that
[48:50] I'm from thy Father's House unto a land
[48:53] that I will shoot
[48:56] notice God didn't show him the land yet
[49:02] he was waiting to show him
[49:07] but sometimes God doesn't show us till
[49:09] we obey him
[49:12] Grande
[49:27] California
[50:26] never told me to move
[50:30] no one told us that we had to move
[50:37] our Church's life is
[50:41] waiting on a sign from God
[50:45] and when God gave it
[50:49] there was no room for doubt in my house
[50:54] there was no daughter my heart God
[50:56] wanted to reload
[50:58] the only decision I had to make
[51:02] will I obey God's will oh yes well I do
[51:06] my own and I said
[51:11] stand in front of you

[52:02] there was something in his heart
[52:05] no in English there's a word
[52:09] you can't translate exactly is homesick
[52:13] foreign
[53:13] foreign
[54:12] foreign
[55:55] [Applause]
[56:11] get me out of my
[56:18] oh God
[56:27] calls Abraham

[56:34] I love Psalm 84.
[56:40] someone that is homesick to be in the
[56:42] Lord's House
[56:49] Tabernacles or Lord of hosts
[56:56] my so long it even fainted for the
[56:59] courts of the Lord because
[57:03] my heart and my flesh cryeth out up for
[57:06] the Living God
[57:12] hi
[57:16] the sparrow has found in house and the
[57:18] swallow a nest for herself where she may
[57:20] lay her Young
[57:55] and Earth
[57:57] sovereign
[59:55] we will rule foreign
[1:00:57] for us
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:21] Glory are yours
[1:01:31] yes
[1:01:33] God had to make Abraham go through
[1:01:35] training
[1:01:41] broke his heart so many times
[1:01:44] broke his heart so many times
[1:01:48] I imagine
[1:01:51] when Abraham got to Iran with his father
[1:01:55] familiares of family members
[1:02:00] God had already told Abraham
[1:02:05] leave your Homeland
[1:02:08] these are parents leave your family
[1:02:12] I want you only for me
[1:02:15] I want you only for me

[1:02:21] once only for him
[1:02:25] yes
[1:02:37] his
[1:02:41] family his brother
[1:02:49] and I imagine God had to do something
[1:02:51] about that
[1:02:53] okay
[1:02:54] I imagine
[1:02:56] that he said I need to take your father
[1:03:00] from you
[1:03:01] I need to take your brother from here
[1:03:04] sometimes we need help from God foreign
[1:03:20] just like he did with the prophet
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:04:06] [Music]
[1:04:27] the Lord all my life
[1:04:53] you've broken my heart over and over
[1:04:57] all right
[1:05:02] yeah yeah
[1:05:04] how many times has God broken our hearts
[1:05:10] and
[1:05:13] it seems like he says forgive me Lord
[1:05:17] forgive me son I can't do it I won't do
[1:05:21] that okay
[1:05:24] we'll do in your life
[1:05:27] because I'm preparing you
[1:05:30] where the Branham says
[1:05:34] you've broken my heart over and over
[1:05:37] but I love you for it
[1:05:40] hello
[1:06:40] he lived as a foreign
[1:08:08] that you want exactly
[1:08:12] senor
[1:08:15] that's the type of God we serve
[1:08:19] it's a God that wants to please
[1:08:24] a guard that wants to please us
[1:08:27] but now with Earthly things
[1:08:30] spiritual things man Eternal with
[1:08:33] permanent things
[1:08:39] yeah Jeremiah 29 11 says
[1:08:44] right now the thoughts I have I think
[1:08:47] toward you say the Lord
[1:08:50] thoughts of Peace not of evil
[1:08:54] to give you an expected end
[1:08:57] let me tell you if on this Earth
[1:09:03] we are a failure
[1:09:06] as long as we're not a failure over
[1:09:08] there
[1:09:10] he has the expected and I desire he has
[1:09:16] the expected ends
[1:09:18] I desire
[1:09:21] there's something in my life
[1:09:24] that is yearning for more
[1:09:27] there's something in my life
[1:09:39] home
[1:09:58] exactly
[1:10:07] but it's required
[1:10:10] of people that are willing
[1:10:14] so not stop stop here
[1:10:18] to not stop halfway
[1:10:22] to not stop with an experience
[1:10:24] superficial with a superficial
[1:10:27] experience or shallow experience
[1:10:35] with just hearing what God can do
[1:10:38] but somebody is
[1:10:41] a personal experience
[1:10:43] the life of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:47] but once everything everything
[1:10:55] just like Abraham
[1:10:58] that is
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:13] Hallelujah
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:22] Abraham was had tears
[1:11:25] because the trial ain't a trials
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:11:57] yeah
[1:12:05] you let go in his hands
[1:12:16] of putting that knife in
[1:12:26] yeah
[1:12:27] it was his promised son
[1:12:34] that's what he waited for 25 years
[1:12:41] because God called Abraham when he was
[1:12:44] old
[1:12:47] don't tell me God can't call you
[1:12:50] don't give God excuses
[1:12:53] we give God so many excuses
[1:13:00] when he was stricken in years
[1:13:03] God proving
[1:13:06] that from nothing he can make sense
[1:13:47] foreign
[1:14:47] amen
[1:14:53] I sincerely believe
[1:14:56] that God is barely working with us
[1:15:00] yes that's right
[1:15:02] 70 years
[1:15:05] 25 years waiting for this promise son
[1:15:14] he preserved
[1:15:17] Abraham preserved himself
[1:15:20] he preserved himself
[1:15:23] God comes for a church that's preserved
[1:15:27] the Bible says when he come to us where
[1:15:30] he find Faith
[1:15:31] let me tell you there must be somebody
[1:15:38] even though they don't see anything yet
[1:15:41] they're still waiting for it
[1:15:44] I'm still waiting
[1:15:46] you'll see God's Miracles
[1:16:14] what that doesn't mean
[1:16:22] that's Abraham's Gene
[1:16:28] come on Hallelujah
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:49] foreign
[1:18:05] I haven't seen it
[1:18:08] Hallelujah
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:58] God tells Abraham
[1:19:03] when he left his father then he left lot
[1:19:59] possess your enemies
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:22] eternity together
[1:20:27] Hallelujah
[1:20:30] palabras in other words
[1:20:34] the devil will close doors
[1:20:39] the devil will close the door the devil
[1:20:43] will try to stop you
[1:20:48] the devil will try to stop you
[1:20:55] hello
[1:20:57] will put all types of stumbling stones
[1:21:02] meanwhile
[1:21:05] um
[1:21:06] I'm sure the same was for Abraham
[1:21:11] all of a sudden he had it Downs
[1:21:18] he had him moments where he didn't know
[1:21:21] what he was doing
[1:21:23] all of a sudden
[1:21:26] he saw around
[1:21:29] and only maybe saw hypocrites
[1:21:51] then he is closer to God than you
[1:21:56] thank you
[1:21:58] all right
[1:21:59] that's the truth
[1:22:04] because God can use a hypocrite also he
[1:22:09] can take him in his hands
[1:22:18] discouragement
[1:22:21] we let a trial hindrance we let
[1:22:25] criticism hinder us
[1:22:28] don't realize
[1:22:44] economy hinder us
[1:22:47] pero but
[1:22:49] when
[1:22:50] God tells Abraham thy seed
[1:22:54] he spoke about us
[1:22:57] he was speaking about us
[1:23:01] we are Abraham's seed
[1:23:27] take me look at me take away what's mine
[1:23:31] neces
[1:23:33] I need to return home
[1:23:39] I won't stay here
[1:23:43] and that is found Fallen
[1:23:48] that's a door of Satan
[1:23:50] that wants to stop you there but you
[1:23:54] must say
[1:23:55] I can't stay this way
[1:23:59] if you allowed
[1:24:05] a door of Satan hinder or stop you
[1:24:09] it's because you don't believe God
[1:24:13] whatever
[1:24:14] [Music]

[1:24:21] I'm going home

[1:24:30] say I will make it
[1:24:33] I will make it
[1:24:36] I return home

[1:24:44] please stand
[1:24:46] [Music]
[1:24:47] not sure what you're you've been
[1:24:49] struggling with
[1:24:53] that is

[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:01] but you know

[1:25:32] I believe God does have you there with a
[1:25:35] purpose
[1:25:35] but it's not for you to stay there
[1:25:39] if God has broken your heart
[1:25:43] it's because he wants you to go help him
[1:25:48] because only somebody with a broken leg
[1:25:51] can help someone else with a broken
[1:25:54] heart
[1:25:55] only someone
[1:25:57] that has had to trust him you can help

[1:26:14] can help someone forgives
[1:26:18] and others come to forgiveness
[1:26:21] only someone that's been there
[1:26:27] can help others when they're falling
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:36] God has a purpose for your life
[1:26:39] healing
[1:27:07] for another heart
[1:27:13] you know God is do you realize God's
[1:27:15] preparing you
