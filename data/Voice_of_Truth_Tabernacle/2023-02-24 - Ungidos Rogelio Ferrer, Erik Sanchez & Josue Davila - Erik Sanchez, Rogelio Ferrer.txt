[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] mentor okay you're solo foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] knows [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] on the biblical characters for our youth get yourself sandal that God is using is and there's a very special character I like to speak about a very used by God and very ruthless the Yama and it means the anointed but I'd like to pray before we in the scriptures loving God before your presence okay we are nobody we can't do anything without it if you don't come down and bring us an anointing allow us that in this little place your sons and daughters and that we can be built up every day especially our youth is whom are special vessels and you continue using Lord in the name of Jesus thank you Lord for this moment or forgive our failures anything we did don't see our flaws Lord yeah God bless my interpreter I'm very happy that he is beside me one more anointed put something special on us uh the scripture says in first Samuel 16 1 Samuel and the Lord said unto Samuel um how long without mourn of fores and go I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemians for I've provided me a king among his sons and the Lord said you can have her with thee and I am come to sacrifice to the Lord to the sacrifice it without shall do and thou shall anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee is and Samuel did that which the Lord speak and then came to bethlehemian and the Elders of the Town tremble that is coming and said and the Elders of the Town tremble that is coming is and he said peaceably I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify ourselves to the sacrifice we're gonna stop here is from eight years old [Music] for God continues working foreign that was happening in this time that the Lord had rejected Saul estaba and he was constantly worried because there was a spiritual catastrophe he is and possibly a Ware to know that there was not a king place by God okay follow me although it was the same thing that they elected the people led themselves by appearance and that's also our title we'll be speaking is the theme for our youth is the subject for our youth God chooses not by appearance but by heart we see in the scripture when the Lord sends Samuel and he goes into Jesse's house in the city of Bethlehem is the boss Jesse was boaz's son you know who the mother was who David's mother was do you know who David's mother was la um the weather of David well is Jesse was David's father right sorry David's grandparents one was bosses Watch God's election how God's work with his children so we are not an exception we see Samuel right with fear yes where Jesse lived he and it says in verse 9 isama then Jesse made shama to pay I know someone said is again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel is and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord hath not chosen these days are here all thy children now he was Rudy with and with all of beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the Lord said all right said arise anoint him for he for this is he is this is tremendous but what impresses on the outward appearance how tremendous and that's what happens to us sometimes no I was young and that's what attracted me the natural eye foreign David was 14 years old when Samuel anointed him and then 15 years yeah and make poems write poems and he was a singer and author and he was a poet he had something special but apparently such a young man innovative harmless that doesn't harm anybody he was used by God like a brave Warrior like a decided man anointed by God and called by guard a young lady young man don't be afraid a is although you might be small or young is using and wants to use you yeah I believe it with all of my heart David full number experience David was a man that experimented ups and downs there's so much to learn about David's life is in the three stages of his life from his youth music [Music] we can call this David's victories or forgive me David's training we find it there in first Samuel chapter 16. and the second where God used him foreign what we see in David's third stage of his life second Samuel 11 or 20 chapter 11 through 20. foreign foreign that's the way God worked with him God was working in his heart a man was I had mercy a man with a righteous heart a man with a Godly heart brother Branham says David's heart was so special he says in the message and the resurrection and the lives preached 1952. and speaks of David being a shepherd foreign and they were healed this is what a beautiful type today Amigos listen friends I have an entire Saddleback and I'm gonna pour it on the Limestone Jesus Christ The Rocks you sheep that are ill commission and you'll surely get better just like anything else a lot of search and such Church mm-hmm this is part of the calvary he said and they will get better this is and if there's ever been a time that sheep are here and we should begin to leak please stop brother no though don't doubt young man young lady that you're a son never doubt or fear that God can't use maybe 10 11 12 years old and I felt a lot of compassion for them although I was young foreign I was compassionate for people that were hurting or that we're homeless or something my heart would break so I say if you don't feel that you need to go to the river and cry and and give yourself because if you don't have that feeling there's something wrong something else is something else is filling your heart and the devil is using God's word that the other things are more important and not the Lord if you are here not because your parents came not because your parents come to church no but because God elected you and he wants you to come not because God chose you God bless you brother [Applause] Hermanos Jesus Christ it's a pleasure to be here I give thanks to God for the opportunity and I've always told Brother Titus for for the choice I'm going to retake this scripture first Samuel chapter 16. and from there we'll go to Psalms 144. Samuel Saul how long will that morning seeing that I have rejected him from reigning over Israel fill that horn with oil even and go temperature is for I have provided me a king among his sons now Psalms 144. verse yeah and this will be my Center my main scripture this is the psalm of David and it says like this blessed be the Lord my strength and pay attention to this which teacheth my hands to work and my fingers to fight my goodness and my Fortress and he and whom I trust do with my people under me but I like the translation of of this this Bible in this last uh paragraph they say is my people yeah to cry continue his work rebelliousness of this man named Saul so then yendo As Time passed or when God tells Samuel to the the house of Jesse because from there I have elected that will be the the the the king of my people but he tells them the first one you see is Samuel gets there is and Jesse gets his wife gets his children together I imagine he gets the workers together and the other one that doesn't cry there is the only one didn't call was David that's yes so then they are unite muchas look many times the same human being is the one who discredits the one who disqualified the one who excludes the human being by his physical appearance and this is what happened with Samuel and with Jesse and with everybody that gathered there as one by one went forward the sons of Jesse is he was looking at this young man over there in the fields probably sitting down Corazon foreign that's the truth amen wow so then one by one goes forward all seven children and all of them they all did not qualify for them have the credentials but for God he was according to his heart entonces so then it's different observe how he trains them foreign we were thinking again of another by the name of David dioses training David when he was just a little boy the prophet came up and poured oil on his head and anointed because God was going to train David to be a mighty warrior immediately at the training he gave him I was reading some time ago up here at Green's Mill where I usually go pray where God said to David I took you for the ship codes from following those few ships of your fathers and I made you a great name like the great men of earth and I think of the rugged training he did to David in so that he can get him quiet so he can listen to God that's still Small Voice then once in contact with with God he becomes Fearless then important that he don't care what anyone says he's been in the presence of God he knows God and the power of his resurrection God begins to train him David did not go to school of life he didn't go to the school of characters but he went to the school of God yes it's yours made made Stones rain from Heaven's there with us that God that opened the Seas this is yours almost extermination like Egypt well clean this world be quiet and still this is defeated [Music] God shows them how to use he faces that giant foreign but look David wants and more yeah learn how to use his hands he knew how to use that slings he's ready for the next level go and take the story yeah look maybe it'll sound a little bit weird makes himself an expert to use it I think he makes himself blood thirsty someone who is a ruthless but for his enemies he didn't touch his heart to fight these Palestines he like to cut heads he didn't put limits on God my time is ending I like this that my brother Vidal shared with me Los curiosos the curious [Music] the curious are not satisfied with yesterday's victories or achievements they rarely lower their guard in the search like silencia Excellence does not take time away from Innovation Elite teams not rest on their Laurels as a result of their of great success they will enjoy a brief celebration learn from the experience and then move on to the next mission I believe David was a curious he was a curious person he wasn't just satisfied or just the experience of today he didn't just stay with us settle with just killing that bears even now look look when David wanted to um tell the daughter of Saw ask for ask for her hand says go go and bring me for foreskins a hundred four skills but David knew that GAR was he knew that God it has an abundance not limit God the greatness of that gun and there was women singing killed a thousands yes it wasn't a mediocre God that's right that's right let's not limit him let let us let him use us that great warrior David that's what he was called foreign that's why he was anointed he knew who was with him that God was greater than the rest God bless you [Applause] amen [Applause] great warrior David a man adios Hermanos do you love God brother in this night man I believe all things that happened in your life are for the benefit of his elected there are times that something happens in our lives and we wonder about parentola but in all things God has a purpose and all things work for good for them that are called according to his purpose I believe we love God in this evening the word says that does not love does not know God because God is love when how many of you believe God is love estamos is we're sure of that right to die for usiendo [Music] he had to go through a preparation you have to be prepared anointed had to go through many trials of the future says he was tall um the tallest man who would only was as tall as this but God told Samuel to not see the outward appearance of the future kingso [Music] maybe no one gave anything for David o but he was God's anointed says the heart of the Lord amen is brother Branham says here um first I want to read first Samuel 17. yes cuando Goliad and this is where Goliath shows up and challenge the children of Israel and God's word says heard this giant it is no man's heart fall because and he a man of war from his son kept his father's sheep own also and there came a lion and a bear it took a lamb out of the flockel and I went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smoke and slew him thy servants slew both the lion sleeps and this uncircumcised shall be as one of them seen he has to fight the armies of the Liberty David said more over Goliad amen foreign youth Queens who is your giant Kenneth who is your Goliath I've asked myself this is sometimes we believe our own Giants are our parents or your brothers or your pastor or the person sitting next to you know sometimes we're mistaken yeah and we blame everybody to our lives and we don't realize going to claim is we don't realize we're truly

I was destroying my life was myself use who is your giant sometimes want to blame everyone else Tomar tomorrow we don't want to take things or be responsible for things which one is your giant who is

to come back to yourself yes the only thing that's bothering Our Lives sometimes are are ourselves because we don't allows we don't allow God to say we want to do it our way we want everyone else to think the way we do we always want to be right there's a dispute a fight we always want to be Prince I think that everyone else is wrong that's not the way it is sometimes let's accept that we make mistakes I remember I was Fed Up and little by little guard started to work in my life I got to the point where even if I wanted to feel his presence because my mother told me to go and I would show up and nothing would happen I didn't even care what the brothers told me one day you belong here you're a son of God man right and I got to the point where I feel God again I don't feel God even if I wanted to but I had to fix my my business I had to accept I was the only one hindering myself and that giant was me was able to unmask this giantas but I'm on my own accounts God was the one that helped me says [Applause] I tell you but [Applause] I wasn't coming to church a friend got in touch with Chicago from Chicago we used to go to church together we used to go to a Baptist Church and she
