[Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] our no working power is amen God bless you it's always good to be in the house of the Lord amen if we can open up our Bibles to the Book of Judges with a chapter three verse 31 . amen go ahead and read it and it says like this and after him was shamgar the son of anith which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox goat and he also delivered Israel I mean if we can flip over to the book of Ephesians as well foreign amen and it says like this it says for we are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do Jesus amen if we can bow our heads Lord Jesus Christ we're just thankful Lord for all that you've given us father and for another opportunity you've given us to be here in your house we just asked that you speak to us today Lord that you take do you help us to step aside and just allow you to take control of the service they help us Lord and may this service be a blessing to us all yeah in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may be seated amen we're going to be moving on to a new character and it's actually we'll be moving on to a new book in the Bible as well to the Book of Judges and the character we're going to be taking a look at today his name is amen and what shamgar is known for he uh as you read as we read here in the scripture is that shamgar killed 600 Philistines it's a really long stick about eight feet is foreign and to help to help settle disputes among them um so there were big leaders in their Community amen now what I find interesting though is that shamgar is only mentioned twice in the Bible says and really what you know about him is that he was the son of anes and you can assume that he was a farmer it doesn't exactly say that but that's about all it says about it in the way that that the Bible explains or the way that he shares his story is far it follows the stories of of great warriors of men who were trained in battle um who were real soldiers and one of them's name was othnio was the nephew of the great warrior Caleb is and he was one of the ones that that helped to deliver Israel from the from the from the pagan people that they lived with yes and then following him was also one of the ones that helped to deliver Israel now both of these men did this with tactic and they did it with an army and at the end of this third chapter of the Book of Judges you see that God couldn't to end that chapter without mentioning sham Garden man it is and I think that's because unlike those who preceded him in the scriptures is that he didn't have an army was a one-man Army amen wasn't a warrior didn't use A Warrior's weapon he didn't use a sword did was he used what he had amen amen amen and I believe that that when God Came Upon sham Garden is that God found him God I imagine that God found him working perhaps shamgar he was plowing his fields and the world around him the world around him the the rest of the Israelites knowing that they were being overtaken by the Philistines everybody was probably freaking out at that time and I I can just imagine shamgar just plowing away there's something inside of him just couldn't let him give up maybe he thought if they're gonna take everything from me I'm gonna at least give it a try amen amen even if I fail yeah I'm gonna give it a try man even though we may feel like we're gonna fail in this Christian world we still have to try until they try and be disappointed or don't try at all and never know if you're truly cut out for this you have nothing to do amen as a Christian you also have responsibilities had a responsibility to his family he couldn't stop working just because everybody else was was running away just because this country was being taken over well amen and I believe that that that's what allowed shamgar to have this great victory over the Philistines it's because the way what here let me read this for you it says like this listen to this because this is you determine your future by the man so whatever you have right now the responsibility is that you have take them seriously because if you don't take them seriously then God can't give you more and you might say well I don't have mucho I'm not responsible for a lot right now and that's okay because the Bible says if you're faithful in the little and yes all he had was an Old Farmer's tool he had no military training he had no Army amen all he had to show for himself was the work that he put in day in and day out and that's exactly what God used amen God will use whatever you give him if you give him of your time he will use it if you give him your energy he will use it if you sacrifice time away from things sports and entertainment when you begin to talk about work sacrifices and responsibilities it doesn't sit well with today's youth amen amen I found a quote and I thought it was pretty good it says it says many people want to ride the train but no one wants to lay down the tracks I thought it was pretty good amen many times I want I want it I want it in my hand I want them to feed it to me and then I'm glad that my dad and my mom they're teaching me and my brothers to be responsible amenities I mean this guy here yesterday he's constantly in my ears telling me that nothing in life is free and then I found that out this month because I paid the internet bill um amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen and when you start talking about growing up to the youth is the excuses amen which he doesn't like to hear either amen you get excuses like I don't have the abilities remember abilities aren't something that's built into you it's not something that's pre-programmed to stay the same your abilities can grow an increase when you learn but the only way to learn is to struggle is to make mistakes it's to fall but many of us don't want to amen another excuse that you get I don't have the resources you have all the resources you have your parents you have your pastors you have the entire church and God has all the windows of Heaven at your disposal that's not exactly an excuse you can use another one that I'm I'm personally acquainted with um I don't have the time when in reality all we have is time we have more than enough amen if we would just quit sleeping in so late then maybe we would have more time do what you have to do wake up earlier stay late just make sure you get done what you have to get done you better look at things and one thing to know that I've learned about the kingdom of God and how to have success um I learned this while I was kind of studying about shamgar aprendiest don't blame don't blame your lack of success on your instruments or your surroundings instrumentals and that's all he had but God used it and if you use what you have is God will give you more I don't think that shamgar ever thought that he was going to use that tour to kill 600 people but many times is our expectations whatever God has given you no matter how simple it might be if you have chance then just at least if you have a mouth then say Amen raise your hands pray for somebody and God will give you more and amen and people make the excuse that that God God wants to help you amen that God wants you to be still okay amen but God wants you to do all that you can before he helps amen he wants you to to push yourself to your limits not only for for him to see but for you to see amen the Bible's filled with these different examples of Simplicity of how God works in Simplicity and shamgar just had a farmer's tools Moses had the rod that he took everywhere with him and that Rod also parted the sea amen all David has all David had was a stone and that that little Stone yes was essentially what brought him to the throne I didn't mean for that rhyme it just came out foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] if we can turn to Judges chapter 3 verse 31 again and after him was Shem called the son of anes which slew of the Philistine 600 men with an ox goat and he also delivered Israel we're going to continue talking about shamgarh and the title that we put it's in Spanish it's in espanol it's called Tu puedes you are able and English is you are able in English and when when brother Tito told me that we're gonna talk about a new Bible character and I asked him who it was and he told me it was and he told me brother Brandon talked about him quite a bit um he mentions them 51 times in the Bible he has not mentioned many times you know but I I believe if if he was just mentioned uh very few times in the Bible he was a hero to God and he and he was worth mentioning you know I I I didn't see much about him in the Bible but I believe he did a a great impact in that time you know how he was just a ordinary Persona ordinary you know he was just a farm laborer you know he he he wasn't mad he wasn't uh he he wasn't a great person a a big Persona he was just a regular small person it was just a regular ordinary person you know he he was he was working his field he was working he was saving all his crops so him and his family can have something to eat for the winner umbrella Brandon talks about he says maybe one one day he didn't hear he he thought the Philistines were not going to come down and he heard them marching down you know coming down towards him he couldn't see them but he can hear them coming and these men were were warriors they were trained to fight foreign just chop somebody up real quick you know but you know but and and as samgard looked at his wife and his kids you know and he said how am I going to let them starved you know I I I I gotta do something about it you know I can't just stay there and you know I don't know how to use a uh excuse me if I say this wrong but a sword you know there's no way I I know how to use it no no no even if I had a shield I wouldn't know how to use it I don't know what am I gonna do you know he says he started walking back and forth pacing back and forth he knew that he couldn't wait for them to show up and take all his his his his his crops you know I I gotta do something about it and that's when God came to him and he reminded him of who he was that he was the seed of and if he can over if Abraham was over able to overcome he can overcome as well he can overcome the enemy and I can imagine him just looking around desperately well this is the way I don't know if you guys can put a picture of it up you know it's it's eight feet long it's used to to move the cattle around and that's all he needed yes with no experience to go and kill those 600 Philistines sold you know many times he tries to take us down he tries to tell us that we're not worthy he tells us that we are nobody that you that you're not able to do nothing you know but we have that same seed that same Seed of Abraham you know if he was able to use he was able to use Abraham if he was able to use Moses if he was able to use Joseph I mean Jose how much more can he use us that we have that same seat you know sometimes we ask ourselves you know I'm nobody knows but brother Branham says you're just in the perfect shape for God to use you don't need to be somebody you could be something so small you could be a sinner but you're just in perfect shape for God to use you why do you use me the way you use me oh here at church they're way better questions than I am sorry you know but why do you use me God there's better Christians here and you know and God tells me this if I was able to use Moses know that he was a drunk if I was able to use Moses that he was a stutterer you know if I was able to use Joseph that was a nobody yeah you know I was able to use a prostitute how much more can I do with you Brothers how much more God can do with us we should never question what God can do with them the fish you know but he he was used he was used to fear to free the Israelites too and how much more can he use us hey man don't let the world tell you who you are no le permitage if someone could just remember oh God told us we were before the foundation of the world don't let the world tell you who you should be God can still use you it doesn't matter how young you are important how old you are God can use you in so many ways 28 26 and I'm just going to read the last I Am With You Always and even into the end of the world he is with us every day it doesn't matter how many times we fail no important it doesn't matter how how many times we stumbled or cuantos versus God is still there you just have to let yourself to be allowed to be used and do the work that God wants to do with you Isaiah 41 10 says I will uphold it with the right hand of righteousness you know he will always hold us he will always keep us with him if he chose us since the foundation of the world how much can how much more again how much more can you do with us if he keeps bringing back your past you know I think we need to start reminding what his future looks like we need to tell him that he is that he's a bluffer okay I am not the bluffer you know but he is the liar thank you Brothers God bless you [Applause] is I was remembering sitting down what if we set the scene in a bedding house 600 Philistines against one Israelite who would you bet on it's the one that's more logical but God is God is a little strange significant God enjoys making from something insignificant to lift up his name so high and in this night foreign families it says he was a normal person and then shamgar was the third judge but this man before being a judge nobody he was we can say a nobody he wasn't anyone he didn't have an uncle like foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh brethren this element brother Brandon says that was all he had a stick y that's all he had um or you might not have anything brother Branham says he was tired I want to take them from your hands and sick Brothers yeah I could do something with us it depends it's up to you it's up to you how you want to be remembered is mentioned in a little piece of the Bible I want that in the book of Acts days have something written about me if you want a little part of that as well my mind the Philistine come and take what he had they said he says oh my mother aren't you tired this is a question aren't you sister yes I will tell me that I can't walk I can't do that he said God bless your heart all things are possible similar things are possible when it says all things it's all things I'm not a warrior you're not a preacher maybe you're not a singer needs to rise I'm sick and tired the odds is against me the odds are against us everything contra dioses it doesn't matter how many odds are against you God is with you not going to question all the demons [Music] he is with you amen Thomas take his word he says there's one thing I know I am circumcised I'm a Philistine I mean I'm in Israelite brother Branham says he says you're a sinner and this night you're a son of God you're a Son of God [Music] who made you who created to tell you who you are right Glory okay that is uncircumcised philistine I know that I'm right how many know that you're in the right tonight you must know what you're believing in brothers or you're rooted brother Branham says we make excuses with our weaknesses you know what one of our weaknesses are and what my brother my sister do that's one of our weaknesses that does not allow us to advance we can advance foreign I think that's one of the things that God gave me for text was to get out of our mind and the text was perfect strength by perfect because sometimes we think we're too great try it sometimes I think there's too much Fidel in me too much brother you know I'm not sure if there's too much of you for me I say that for myself to blame or guilty I'm the one that's guilty because I hinder God because I'm hindering God I always blame someone else to blame right amen is there's little things that we do and that's what we come to church for us is to find out where our fault is and the things that we might better ourselves by I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming at church that's why we live very defeated sometimes because we come with the wrong attitude foreign [Music] took everything away they heard them malnourished that they took away everything amen is what does being poor in spirit mean s that our heart be in the right place and spirit where we've surrendered everything to God and we don't feel we have anything of ourselves we don't have anything to lose we don't have anything to lose brethren for everything to gain amen yes I was saying what's more important than eternal life important than eternal life how can our trials be easier for us he says trials are harder for us because we haven't decided to surrender everything to God shamgar he was in a crossroad in other words get in Tania he had they say foreign there was no other way there's no other way is the only way God has provided for there to be success in our lives you have to place everything [Music] that's where there's a squeeze because we don't want no one to give us orders oh I'm the owner of my life how's the pastor going to tell me otherwise that the pastor is helping you sir to get to Eternity in other words he's helping you Perfection he is perfecting us sometimes we don't want the discipline but that's the way to go up [Applause] in your life [Applause] I guarantee you you'll be success in your lives please stand we'll be praying Celestial Heavenly Father we give you thanks for your word Lord please allow Ed allow us to make ourselves aside Lord I don't know how many here are tired I was always stepping on us that he's humiliating us It's Time Lord It's deep it's time to raise the flag raise the banner [Music] foreign [Music] I don't want to be a simple Christian Lord I want my name
