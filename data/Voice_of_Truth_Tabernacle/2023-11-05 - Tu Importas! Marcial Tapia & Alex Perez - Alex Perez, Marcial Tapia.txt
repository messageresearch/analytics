brother like you believe it this morning brother Bram says that your soul is worth more worlds let's open to the word of God Beau God's presence if you can follow me to 1 Corinthians 15 verse 21 they can put it on the screen also 1 Corinthians 15:21 let's read brethren for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive you can follow me to Luke 19:10 you can just follow on the screen for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost may God add blessing to his word to the reading of his word you may all be seated brotherr our subject is fighting for souls and for a title me and my brother Alex have titled this sermon with the inspiration of the Holy Ghost you matter I matter Brethren you matter everyone in here matters and also the ones outside matters because I believe with all my heart that there are many children of God out there there are many children of God out there there are many Souls crying crying for the holy spirit amen brother now my question what are you going to about it because you believe God is in his children now what is God going to do after this service what are we going to do I ask myself this what am I going to do after God spoke to me so our title is you matter am amen Brothers we thank God for our pastor how the Holy Ghost has been working with him and how that wakes us up that our soul matters God's Souls matter because for a Time the souls his children were with him am amen Brothers in some time we were with God now if we are here only and for the great love he has towards us that's the reason why we are here and that doesn't make us better than the ones out there no we should be so glad that God has us here hearing God's word and now I believe with all my heart that the souls out there are crying out are crying out for someone to them for someone to speak to them of the greatness of God yesen Amen looken let's bring this scene a little of Adam and Eve and I'm thankful to God because the spirit through speaking with our brother Eric it hit my heart when he shared this with me and that's where I want to take my thought now we're going to draw a picture this morning who was Adam who was Eve Adam was the son of God that God chose to be in that Garden of Eden yes brother now God God put Adam in that place for a job and inside of that after some time God decided to give him a wife wife that in that time was the female that we now know as Eve now why did I read this verse because this scripture says that sin came through a resurrection would come through a man also Amen brother now who sined who sinned first it was Adam who sin because sin is with knowledge if you do things knowing that is sin but the word says that Eve says that Eve was deceived Eve was deceived by the serpent by the Devil Himself that he got in that c now that devil is still Among Us he still is working and fighting against God's children now who would have thought such a perfect creation and that the devil could pervert in that clean Place only God's presence dwells and now Satan that is so subtle could get in that Serpent and could deceive the creation God set in that place now that's where Eve was Now Eve Eve was deceived but just meditate a little what Adam was going through when his wife when his beloved what he loved the most was deceived by that serpent what crossed Adam's mind what could you imagine that Adam was going through when he seen even that falling condition see her destroyed imagine Adam's pain that he had to redeem her had to cover her had to pay a price had to let go how much did it not to leave God's presence to redeem his wife imagine brother Adam was reflecting in that moment was God's characteristics for a soul for one Soul now brother let's bring it to our lives what are we doing with our families what are we doing with our children with our husbands and our wives those are souls that are Priceless nevertheless the devil has come into our mind so bother us and take us out of God's perfect when you're in God's presence when you're in God's presence everything is perfect yes brother when you come to church and the holy spirit moves everything is perfect everything is perfect when you leave these doors you face the reality of with problems with trials everything the devil has out there and that's what makes you think a little how much did it hurt Adam to let go of everything or leave everything to redeem his wife yes brother now everything is a perfect plan from God although we don't understand at the moment everything is God's perfect plan because if that hadn't happened we would not be here yes Breen Adam said I I I have to pay a price I need to do it no one else I got to do it God when he saw that how do you think God felt he must have had a to see what condition his children were and he also thought who I I will go I will go and pay the price he descended flesh and body to dwell in this earth and he paid the price for us for his children why because he loves us because he loves you he loves you loves us brethren that should make us be so know that it's God's love here with a purpose why is it hard to come to church and hear his word and why is it easy go to the world and be but look brother a Son of God it hurts to Son of God when he makes a mistake there's a pain in the Son of God look brother how the devil is that little by little he's keeping you dormant yes brotherr it's little by little it's the opposite of the word little here a little there yes [Music] brother the devil is the same same way now when the Lord Jesus decided to come for you and I it's because he loved me because he loved you yes brethren lookis Genesis 3 ver9 it says and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where are thou who it was God it was God searching for us it was God searching for it was God searching for his children today in this time in this hour in this moment it's God searching for you what will you do with that call God wants you and God is telling you where art thou amen Brethren that's what God has told me where are thou Marshall what are you doing yes Brethren because I'm a man as you are I make mistakes I think I'm going to speak brother also a little of the maniac of gadera who was this Gan brother brandham says he was a man brother Bram was drawing a picture that maybe this man went to church he was a good man reputation maybe as you and I are right we come to church are message [Music] believer all of a sudden we want to show that we're important but I tell you one thing brother the only one that's important is our Lord Jesus Christ Amen brother the pastor was telling us of this little man that weighed 150 pound just like this little man that almost weighs around 150 pounds the most that he was worth was 84 cents now this flesh you see standing up here is only worth 84 cents but what's inside this man there's a value of more than 10,000 worlds in this man there's a value that there's nothing in this world that can pay for it now we heard brother say a soul is worth more than 10,000 and in this message that I found says that they're worth 10 millions in other words, 1,000 time 10,000 oh brotherr we should Rejoice that your soul is worth more than 10 millions of worlds you are Priceless hallelujah hallelujah Brethren now that's why I understand why the pastor speaks so us because he about God's Souls hallelujah hallelujah yes brother your souls matter to God and if we are God's children God's Soul should matter to me do they matter to you how much do they matter to you have you thought about that Brethren if they don't matter if this has gotten to me that my soul matters to me how will the rest matter to me until you need to realize that my soul is priceless Amen brother to understand someone else you must understand yourself to know someone else's value you need to know your own value amen then Breen that tells me that need to take care of what God has given me now looken look at this here in this town in gader there was this man man of good reputation but brother Bram says all of a sudden he was in church maybe someone insults him maybe someone makes or Com or they began to criticize him and he found out he heard and asked himself how is it that in a church of the message that we believe in the Supernatural where the holy spirit says how can they talk bad about me how can they say that about me yes brotherr it happens too many it happens to me don't don't think you're the only one it happens to me also and I ask for forgiveness because I've realized how valuable you are to God how valuable your soul is I should be more careful I should walk speak different behave different because it's your soul and your soul is priceless and who am I to tell you how much you worth when God's word tells us that you're worth more than this earth now there was this man here who was going to be able to help him a man that had Legion that had many demons for one thing like that brother says that maybe he began to drink and there he caught a demon maybe he began to steal and he got another and maybe he was a little Lial and he got to the point says so where the demons dominated him but there was one man one man that hurt his cry that hurt that soul and didn't stay still he had to cross the sea Waters stormy seas yes Breen and there he was there he was on his way searching for for who that was crying out for a Deliverance there I was crying for a Deliverance that's how I was yes brother forgot where God has brought you from remember where you come from and that will help you that will help you feel for everyone else to cry with your brother amen Brethren the Lord Jesus Christ he knew there was a soul crying out when he got there when he got there he saw him he saw him and the demons did not wait from him because it wasn't time it wasn't time but for God the right time is when he descends on the scene he begins to work with his children then it's time many times us as humans we say it's not yet it's not my time yet but when it's God's time it's not your time because my thoughts are not God's thoughts nor my words it's his words glory to God there was that Soul crying that Soul was crying brother Bram says those demons gave so much strength to that he was three times stronger than a regular man he has more strength three times stronger from a regular man what about man of God filled with the Holy strength should he have to lift his hands to say Thank You Lord hallelujah hallelujah how much more should you have to say Thank You Lord thank you for your holy spirit thank you for delivering me thank you Lord for my healing how much more what do we need Church fours fours what has God called us for to save souls to speak to the people don't be ashamed amen were you ashamed of cursing were shamed of hearing you weren't ashamed of that no brother we were not ashamed of that no and now that we have the greatest God's love why can't we testify of what God is doing today in my life where God has brought me out of from how many things hasn't God healed how many things hasn't God saved me from oh brother there are millions of things we could testify of God bless you wow brother Marshall he's uh he's on fire today if you can just stand with me for a few minutes you can open your Bible with me just to stretch a little First Corinthians chapter 2 verse one and on read verse one and verse two and then you can take your seat you matter in this morning when you have if you can say Amen the word of God says and I brotherr when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified brother thank you the apost Paul after he had his experience with the pillar of fire his life changed never the same he was something happened in that trip on his way to persecute Christians he had a supernatural experience I'm thinking in English this morning brother and something happened to him something happened to him he was never the same after he had that experience the Bible says he went to Arabia for three years to make sure that the experience that he received was real he wanted to make sure that it wasn't a tale that it wasn't just a feeling an emotion he had he wanted to make sure that that experience was from God after those three years the Bible tells us and brother brandham opens up the picture when he returns to Jerusalem he is searching for Peter he searches for a man that had time spend time with Jesus because there's something special about a person when she spent time with Jesus the people of today let me tell you will notice when a person has been with Jesus we're no longer in the Dark Ages when people were doing things blindly not anymore people know enough now people know too [Music] much books where people find out and it's hard to speak to one soul today yes we are sincere today it's hard but when Paul descends to Jerusalem and meets with Peter brother Bram says that they saw eye to eye that their doctrines match so much that they may eye to eye and Paul could find out that his experience was real and time passes Paul had to express his experience he wanted to give a testimony because when a person has had an encounter with God when a person has had an encounter with God I believe they cannot stay quiet I believe they have to be that light that light for a dark world so Paul on his second missionary trip the Bible tells he went to Corinth cor Corinth is in Greece the people of Greece let me tell you they were very religious if you think you're religious for coming to church dressing well looking well the people in Corinth they were dedicated people to their gods they had their gods they had their Idols they had their synagogues and Paul moved by the Holy Spirit to go to Corinth in Greece the Bible doesn't tell how he got to Corinth nor the journey but the thing is that when he arrived to Corinth he is meeting people that knew a lot yes they had their de they had their gods and when Paul finds out what type of people live there I'm GNA give you an example the Pagan man back then the common man had three wives many of us we have enough with one but the common man had three wives his wife who gave him his children had his uh Cony no just he had a slave that he would just sleep with as many times as they wanted and then they had their concubine the one that he would go to put it up for exhibition and Paul finds out these people were lost and Paul says how can I present them Christ how can I make the people listen and pay attention to what I need to say are you following me till now so Paul begins to say these words verse one and I brother when I came to you came now with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God the first thing Paul realizes and catches is that he had not his own testimony he had it for dung everything he had done the past his education his credentials a Roman citizen he had it for T he had nothing of himself that's why he said testimony of God God did for you I did for you done for you I believe that's the problem today I want to show what I know abilities capabilities and people don't want to see that anymore resurrected Christ I ain't here I can be very faulty and I am but I'm not here because someone preached nice to me because someone encouraged me to be here brainwash me no someone proved Jesus Christ out of history and presented him now because we know a lot but we have not one evidence we cannot prove Jesus Christ is living today that's where the problem is so Paul found that out and he found out he couldn't only rely on persuasive words although Paul could be persuasive Paul was a doctor of the law if anyone could speak Peter couldn't even write his name but Peter had the power of Jesus Christ what the world needs it's a lived life Paul finds out he was an open book that's why Paul in his letters he tells the Corinthians ye are letters written in our hearts known and read for through men by men an Asian women just learn to read and says open books a Chinese woman who had just learned to read prayed saying Lord we are going to work among many people who cannot read Lord make our lives open Bibles so that those who cannot read the book can read it in us I don't know about you this morning but I'm an open book an open book and we ask ourselves why can't we rescue Souls we are speaking of rescuing Souls right Paul we can learn a lot from verse four says 1 Corinthians 2:4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom no no you this morning can you are very wise I respect that but you cannot make an impact in this life in this world we living the people don't need to see people that know a lot I know a lot of people know a lot about history know a lot about well that's not what people are looking for in a person and Paul understands and he says I need to come demonstration of the spirit and power you know what brother you have a demonstration follow that people can see when you've been with god brother Brom says give me five minutes if they have the Holy Ghost my problem sometimes is that I haven't understood I need to spend more time with him there has to be less of and more of God I need to Wayne so he can grow you know what church I find out that truly we do not love the souls we don't have love for love stir pain for the people says that the people are dying take them to Christ what we realize that when he understood the experience he had he realized that he would be the mediator for the [Music] people to see God when it's open to us we can say it and we are saying it but when the knowledge is open in us and we can truly understand that the people what they want to see is God and that you can be that person present a resurrected Christ then it matters when how we speak it does matter how I behave what type of language I have one occasion Peter wasn't converted Yet brother Edward so he was a little like this and Jesus Christ was about to be crucified and he was running away Brethren all of a sudden he joins a group and they ask him hey weren't you the one that was with Jesus no no no no no not me but I'm almost sure you oh that's how we are church not me I don't go to church your speech gives you up there was a brother that went to Mexico City to evangelize he had plans to visit his family but his excuse was to tell the pastor I'm going to go evangelize so the pastor could let him go don't worry that brother is not here and when the brother returned the p with your family they didn't even notice that I was a Christian brother Bram says and the message seeing his star even the title has a lot to speak brother brandham says what is the gospel what is the Gospel Church many say it's this Bible I tell you that it's this Bible people don't want to know a lot about this they want to see that here you know why I'm get in trouble but I begin to think when the angel tells John stop writing it's because you know what church it wasn't so much about writing anymore what was going to happen was going to happen in and human Epistles we'll leave that for the seven for those that like to study these things but brother what is the gospel the musicians can come the gospel come not only through the word but through Power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost and these signs shall accompany those that believe signs church signs follow you we're no longer in the Pentecost and the greatest was speaking in Tong signs to follow me life of Jesus Christ in human flesh in a man that is greater brother Bram says that's what we need today brother the world's asking today where is that God I ask you in this morning where is God Church where is god brother says where is that God one that used to be where is that God of History sometimes I speak with people and I know they know more about history than I do but people don't want to know so much about that anymore if the god of History isn't the same God today what good does a god of History do what do we gain in speaking of God of History God of yesterday we don't gain anything the entire world knows Jesus came to Earth and died that's not so much good news anymore it's not anything new no church brother Bram says we're reading from brother brandham what happened to the great Jehovah look brother people are asking themselves where is that great Jehovah the Bible where's that Mighty God that where's that man that raised the dead where is that God that can change my [Music] situation the people are dying church and you are the only hope I'm The Only Hope see this strikes my heart because I believe every one of us one way or another have failed in this [Music] area I haven't been a good representative of Christ I haven't been a good ambassador of Christ but that's the only way that you that the people might see Jesus we're waiting for the coming of the Lord right people are waiting for a God to descend from heaven and come and change their situation and you have believe we have that answer that the world needs the answer continues being Jesus Christ he is the same yesterday today and forever I believe he doesn't change he doesn't change Church he continues being Jesus Christ continues raising restoring Souls continues restoring I tell you Church in this moment you are still doubting today can be your morning I want to tell you and encourage you sometimes we ourselves are doubting the I tell you this morning still the same he doesn't change still deliver you resue you and give you what you need ask God for forgiv Lord the best representative you have maybe one Soul maybe I can be that person can see God through me God people need what happened says brother brandham what has happened Church the world has come inside us that's what happened that's why we can't recognize the people don't recognize us and I don't want to be a hypocrite person I want to be honest with God and say God as Daniel said we've [Music] sinned Daniel was representing with his people and he said we've sinned we've left you recognize who we are anymore bright stand back Son of God I a daughter of God has done something in me or has he not done in you think where you would be now if God had brought you God not had mercy on you where would you [Music] be it's time to reflect not for something or not for no reason the pastor by the Holy Spirit has given us rescuing lost souls want me to tell you something while you stand sometimes I need saving as I studied this message I said Lord but the one that is lost is me sometimes I'm the one that's lost sometimes I need be reminded Lord that you've done something for me change me first people see that change transform me first isn't that what we want Church transformation that's what Paul had imp he had all we need is one surrendered man to God this world doesn't need a lot of people needs and women surrender to [Music] God the altar is [Music] open let's worship him tonight to this this morning in my Pro tell them this morning I need you more than ever and you are more Lord I need you

we're in crucial times Brothers I was meditating last night our science has been growing and people don't even want to go out and do their shopping I see how the trucks come delivering groceries to where I live I sh to my wife later on we're not going to want to go out but this is all part of this it's a privilege to be part of this history of the Lord Apostle Paul said he would have desired to be here to the end and be part of History we feel privileged to be here at the end of the story meditating as well I was thinking of Jonah he didn't want to go and preach out in N I can imagine him saying why they're not but he had to go through death and resurrection that Journey I believe many times we oh we don't even believe in or go there to save Souls but we have to pass through death and Resurrection as well the greatest victory that Sansom had I don't know how many he killed or how many women he had the greatest victory that he had was when he died when we died to our own ideas and beliefs and our own intelligence I believe that's when we'll have the greatest Victory brothers that's something I felt on of God I'm going to be giving the announcements let us continue praying for
