[33:45] Christ God deserves all the honor and
[33:49] Glory when I'm
[33:52] here being here gathered one more time
[33:56] it's a blessing
[33:58] to be in the temple of
[34:03] God and truly it's something that we we
[34:06] don't have words to
[34:09] express the love that God has towards
[34:16] us today we'll start speaking of the
[34:19] character
[34:20] Jonah one of the things I like about
[34:24] Jonah is in the first chapter
[34:27] Jonah can
[34:29] recognize that he's the
[34:33] problem and that's what we need is to
[34:37] recognize that many times we are the
[34:39] problem it's not
[34:41] God it's not our situation it's not our
[34:45] brother our
[34:46] sister we are the
[34:52] problem you can open your scripture to
[34:55] Jonah chapter 1
[34:57] I'll be talking in
[35:01] English if when you have it if you can
[35:03] please say
[35:06] amen and it says like
[35:09] this the word of the Lord came to Jonah
[35:13] son of
[35:19] amiti go to the great city of Nineveh
[35:22] and preach against it because its
[35:25] wickedness has come come up before
[35:34] me but Jonah ran away from the Lord and
[35:38] headed for
[35:44] tares he went down to Joba where he
[35:46] found a ship Bound for that
[35:53] Port after paying the fair he went
[35:55] aboard and sell for
[36:01] tares to flee the
[36:04] Lord we can please by our
[36:07] heads dear heavenly father
[36:09] Lord Lord we thank you once
[36:12] again Lord for giving us your grace and
[36:16] your
[36:18] mercy Lord for giving us one more
[36:20] opportunity
[36:22] Lord to straighten Our
[36:25] Lives in the straight
[36:30] path to put our lives in the path that
[36:32] you have
[36:35] provided father without you we are
[36:38] nothing we worthless
[36:41] father but you you have made us
[36:47] wor father may we also recognize
[36:51] Lord Lord that there's not much time
[36:55] left we are at the end
[36:59] Lord Lord and and if if it's just one
[37:01] Soul
[37:03] father Lord may be me
[37:06] Lord Lord may be my may be my brothers
[37:10] Lord Lord but I ask that you may move
[37:14] tonight put this service in your
[37:17] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:19] Christ amen amen you may be seated
[37:22] brothers and
[37:24] sisters now I don't know if you know the
[37:26] book of
[37:28] Jonah or the character of
[37:30] Jonah you know many many people know the
[37:33] Book of Jonah by him being eaten by
[37:40] whale you know but there's more to Jonah
[37:43] than just
[37:45] that you know in the first chapter of
[37:49] Jonah God is God
[37:52] gave Jonah a
[37:55] commission
[37:57] he said go and preach to
[38:00] Nineveh because his wickedness has come
[38:02] up before
[38:04] me now how many
[38:07] here when God tells you
[38:10] something or you know what to
[38:12] do you know but sometimes we try to tend
[38:15] to go a different
[38:18] routes you know and that's what happened
[38:20] to
[38:21] Jonah you know
[38:23] Jonah he brother Brown says that Jonah
[38:25] was a a good
[38:29] person know he was a true man of
[38:32] God you know but he's just his human as
[38:34] you and I
[38:36] are you know and sometimes you know the
[38:39] Bible says that that Jonah tried to flee
[38:43] from the
[38:45] Lord but let me tell you
[38:48] something all things work for
[38:51] good for those who believe in
[38:53] God you know and as we read the Book of
[38:56] Jonah
[38:58] you know Jonah got aboard this
[39:01] ship that was heading for
[39:04] tares you know and and there was Sailors
[39:06] on top of
[39:08] [Music]
[39:09] it and Jonah was found
[39:14] asleep in the midst of a
[39:19] storm after going a different
[39:24] path he was asleep
[39:28] and that happens to that that does
[39:30] happen to us many
[39:32] times when we try to flee from what God
[39:35] tells us to
[39:37] do or what we're supposed to
[39:39] do and then we get into our little
[39:41] comfort zone just like Jonah
[39:44] did you know the Bible says that there
[39:46] was this big storm
[39:49] raging you know but here was Jonah
[39:53] asleep and we can put it this way in his
[39:55] comfort zone
[39:59] how many of us sometimes get in our
[40:00] little Comfort
[40:03] zones I think I think we I think every
[40:05] day we we go into our little comfort
[40:07] zone
[40:10] amen but this but this sailor told
[40:14] Jonah he told
[40:19] Jonah he said how can you
[40:22] sleep he said get up and call your
[40:25] God maybe he will take notice of us that
[40:28] we will not
[40:32] perish you know and this is the part
[40:34] where Jonah
[40:37] recognizes he recognizes that he was the
[40:41] problem wasn't God it wasn't the
[40:44] situation that he was
[40:46] in it was
[40:49] himself in verse 12 he
[40:54] says after they threw
[40:57] the Bible says that they they pretty
[40:58] much took their chances on who was to
[41:00] blame for
[41:06] this you know and and it fell on
[41:10] Jonah you know and then he says
[41:12] this says pick me up and throw me into
[41:15] the
[41:16] sea
[41:19] verse and it will become
[41:23] calm I know that this is my fault
[41:27] and this great storm has come upon
[41:32] you now in the message the Queen of
[41:36] Sheba it says like this and when when
[41:39] God gave Jonah the commission and he
[41:41] went down to Nineveh he found a ship at
[41:52] leisure so he couldn't get his take and
[41:54] his fair maybe down to end of a so he
[41:56] just went to tares and they found out
[41:58] that he got in
[42:04] trouble I think that's what's the matter
[42:06] with the Christian church
[42:11] tonight we're in
[42:14] trouble we've took the wrong
[42:18] road and this is exactly what happened
[42:20] to
[42:21] Jonah he decided to do things his own
[42:24] way he tried to do of will of
[42:29] God you know but that wasn't the perfect
[42:32] will of
[42:34] God and continue saying and God's not in
[42:39] trouble it's the church that's in
[42:43] trouble it's me that's in
[42:45] trouble God wants us to be all
[42:49] one wants us to have Fellowship one with
[42:54] another you know and I think think that
[42:56] God's perfect
[42:59] will you know I think God's perfect will
[43:01] is for us to be
[43:05] United to be
[43:07] together not to be
[43:10] cold amen
[43:12] amen we're a
[43:14] church we're a team we're a
[43:23] family and the message the same the same
[43:25] message say the queen of actually no the
[43:28] queen of the
[43:31] South it says now many people get the
[43:33] wrong conception of
[43:37] Jonah we we try saying he's a
[43:42] Jonah brother says I'd like to stop just
[43:44] for a minute Jonah was no bad
[43:51] person he was a real man of
[43:55] God
[43:57] there's nothing happens provincial to a
[43:59] true real true servant of
[44:08] God how many can say Amen it all works
[44:12] together for good to them that love
[44:16] God and Jonah was commissioned to go to
[44:21] Nineveh but that ship going to
[44:24] Tar I want you to pay
[44:27] attention wasn't the
[44:30] relief to the
[44:33] least
[44:36] resistance I don't know if you get that
[44:38] tonight
[44:40] Church wasn't the relief to the least
[44:46] resistance you know the message tonight
[44:48] is called resisting the will of
[44:54] God you know know and I believe that
[44:57] sometimes we
[44:59] resist what God has in store for
[45:02] us we try we try to tend to do things
[45:05] our own
[45:09] way but God has a different way for
[45:12] us it's not our
[45:18] way it wasn't the relief to the least
[45:24] resistance I believe that many of the
[45:26] times we try to find
[45:30] relief on some other
[45:32] things we try to find
[45:37] relief with our
[45:40] car our
[45:43] phone our
[45:45] work is that
[45:54] true
[46:00] Jonah you know Jonah was a very special
[46:04] person you know and throughout the
[46:06] scripture of chapter 1 2 3 and
[46:10] four you know in in the chapter
[46:16] two Jonah makes a prayer to
[46:20] God you know and remember that Jonah was
[46:22] already in the well in the belly of the
[46:25] well
[46:29] and he makes a prayer to
[46:31] God you know and God found
[46:36] favor in that
[46:39] prayer you know because God is a god
[46:42] that is
[46:44] merciful god is a god that is
[46:47] gracious God is a god that is giving us
[46:50] time he's given us borrow
[46:53] time cuz we're we're on borrow time
[46:55] brothers and
[46:57] sisters brothers we're at we're at the
[47:00] end of
[47:01] time there's not much time
[47:04] left so why are we still in the
[47:06] condition that we're
[47:11] in so
[47:13] so God found favor in in his in his
[47:20] prayer you know and throughout the the
[47:23] story of
[47:24] Jonah
[47:26] you know Jonah was commissioned to talk
[47:28] to
[47:31] Nineveh brother Brown says that it was a
[47:33] city of millions of
[47:37] people now can you imagine yourself
[47:40] going to
[47:42] Denver and God tells
[47:45] you I need you to tell the people to
[47:51] repent how many here would do
[47:54] it
[47:57] I think it'd be pretty hard
[47:59] correct you know but this is what Jonah
[48:01] had to
[48:02] do he was commissioned to do
[48:05] something it was God's perfect will to
[48:08] to go to for him to go to
[48:11] Nineveh you know and one of the things
[48:13] that got got Jonah
[48:18] mad you know was that when he gave when
[48:20] the message reached the
[48:24] king
[48:26] for the people to pretty much
[48:30] repent you know the Bible says that they
[48:34] everybody put on sackcloth even the
[48:41] animals now sa Claus is something that
[48:44] back
[48:45] then if not mistaken the
[48:53] Israelites it's usually made of black
[48:55] black goat
[49:02] hair it was used by the Israelites and
[49:04] their neighbors in times of
[49:07] mourning in times of
[49:16] mourning yes you know and the people did
[49:21] so you know and and God forgave the
[49:24] people of n
[49:28] but but Jonah questioned his
[49:32] mind how could God forgive
[49:37] people you know and then he thought into
[49:41] himself you know Jonah knew that God was
[49:44] a gracious and forgive
[49:50] forgive he remembered that God had
[49:53] forgiven Jonah
[49:58] you know and I believe that
[50:01] tonight you know God has found favor in
[50:05] us God had God sees something in
[50:09] you that the world can never
[50:12] see you know it only takes a little bit
[50:14] of Faith brothers and
[50:16] sisters you know to be able to do the
[50:18] perfect will of
[50:20] God because you have to trust
[50:24] God you have to trust God with the plan
[50:26] that God has for
[50:29] you amen
[50:32] amen I'd like to finish with this quote
[50:34] from Brother
[50:37] Bram and the message
[50:41] perseverance and if
[50:44] Jonah under those
[50:47] circumstances could have could have that
[50:50] much faith in
[50:52] God what about you
[50:56] brother brother Brown says that no one
[50:59] has had it harder than
[51:05] Jonah and I can show you what brother
[51:07] Bram
[51:11] says there's none of you
[51:15] here that bad under the
[51:20] circumstances so brothers and
[51:22] sisters let's aim
[51:26] let's
[51:29] aim yeah let's aim to do the perfect
[51:31] will of
[51:34] God let's ask God for
[51:37] guidance and not take that road that
[51:39] Jonah
[51:41] took not try to find a
[51:45] solution to something that God already
[51:47] has in store for
[51:50] us or try to find a different Road or a
[51:52] different
[51:54] path God bless you brothers and
[52:06] sisters God bless you
[52:10] Brothers the precious name of Lord Jesus
[52:14] Christ I see you very
[52:20] serious I'm making
[52:23] questions another day
[52:26] a young man asked me are you going to
[52:30] preach and I told him if I'm PR
[52:37] questions make questions so that you
[52:39] don't sleep glory to
[52:44] God our brother Timothy took a very
[52:47] important
[52:51] scripture that God spoke in my heart to
[52:54] speak is about
[52:56] recognizing it's a very small
[53:00] word can put it up on the
[53:07] projector that word that word
[53:14] recogniz that's his
[53:19] fault to recognize that something's your
[53:21] fault that's not
[53:24] easy
[53:26] focus on that word
[53:28] Brothers it's so
[53:32] important if you can read it there
[53:38] recognize Now read it
[53:46] backwards
[53:48] right left to right it
[53:53] says same way to left and
[53:56] back why Co
[53:59] no God isn't a god of
[54:03] coincidence that word is
[54:06] there so we can
[54:09] recognize when we're the
[54:13] problem how don't we like to recognize
[54:15] when they're the
[54:16] problem I don't like your
[54:19] brothers but we need to
[54:21] recognize glory to
[54:24] God
[54:27] myself there
[54:29] Brothers
[54:31] many how many struggling
[54:33] that there's a lot of us right glory to
[54:37] God continue
[54:39] talking on the character of
[54:43] Jonah we're gonna read in Jonah chapter
[54:46] 1 verse
[54:48] one if you may please stand
[54:54] Brothers so you can rest from
[54:58] sitting read the word of
[55:00] God says like
[55:09] this now the word of the Lord came unto
[55:11] Jonah the son of Emi
[55:20] saying arise go to n that great City and
[55:23] cry against it for their wickedness has
[55:25] come up before
[55:40] me Hallelujah but Jonah rose up to flee
[55:43] unto tares from the presence of the Lord
[55:45] and went down to Joba and he found a
[55:47] ship going to tares so he paid the fair
[55:48] thereof and went down into it and go
[55:51] with them unto tares from the presence
[55:53] of the Lord glor
[55:56] you may be seated
[55:58] Brothers we're seeing here that
[56:00] Jonah was a prophet
[56:04] right can a young man tell
[56:06] me
[56:15] question how many know what a prophet
[56:18] is the mouth of
[56:21] God the other other day they told me
[56:25] when we were here
[56:28] brother that we should preing away all
[56:30] the children and
[56:34] understand sometimes I
[56:39] preach make it down so everyone can
[56:42] understand so we know
[56:44] brothers that a prophet is a mouthpiece
[56:47] of so Jonah was a
[56:50] prophet he God spoke personally to
[56:53] him and what did he do when God spoke to
[56:55] him he disobeyed
[56:59] correct he said go to gy and he took to
[57:02] some other
[57:04] place how many times have we done the
[57:07] same how many can
[57:09] identify I identify with Jonah brothers
[57:12] because many times they told me don't do
[57:14] this and that's the first thing I
[57:21] do he thought he was fleing from the
[57:23] presence of God
[57:27] can we flee from the presence of
[57:30] God Psalms
[57:39] 139 shall I go from thy Spirit or
[57:42] whether shall I flee from thy
[57:51] presence if I Ascend up into heaven thou
[57:54] are there
[57:57] so God
[57:59] covers wherever you
[58:01] are wherever you want to
[58:03] hide you're never going to be able to
[58:05] hide from
[58:06] God and that's a good
[58:09] thing because many
[58:11] times we're doing bad
[58:13] things Jonah was disobeying dis beinging
[58:17] God but God was with
[58:19] him how many of us
[58:21] Brothers when we're in the world
[58:25] we're doing bad
[58:26] things we're fleeing from the presence
[58:28] of
[58:30] God and God was with
[58:33] us can
[58:35] say
[58:36] because that time where I was fleeing
[58:38] from your presence you were there with
[58:40] me GL glory to
[58:47] God blessed
[58:50] God you can see here that
[58:53] Jonah was fleeing from God
[58:56] he went and
[58:57] slept I'm going try to go here
[59:02] quickly it says God sent a
[59:14] storm they used to pray
[59:18] to they used to cry out to their
[59:22] gods they were crying out to their gods
[59:25] GL glory to
[59:28] God to get dead
[59:32] Gods blessed
[59:36] God in Psalms
[59:42] 1155 their Idols of of silver and
[59:46] gold their works of
[59:50] men they have mouths but do not
[59:53] speak they have eyes but do
[59:57] not they have ears
[59:59] yet they have no smell they have
[1:00:05] hands they have feet but do not
[1:00:07] walk they don't speak with their
[1:00:12] throat similar to
[1:00:16] the we have mouths
[1:00:19] correct say glory to
[1:00:23] God
[1:00:25] all those Sailors were
[1:00:27] there crying out to the
[1:00:30] gods they false gods are dead
[1:00:34] Gods true God was sleeping glory to God
[1:00:39] what happened this
[1:00:40] night church where they have dead
[1:00:44] Gods worshiping their God where we have
[1:00:47] the
[1:00:53] truth you have given
[1:00:55] reation thank you because we have the
[1:00:57] message of the
[1:00:59] hour should we not be thankful Brothers
[1:01:02] glory to
[1:01:04] God there was Jonah
[1:01:09] sleeping says the captain went to woke
[1:01:11] wake him
[1:01:13] up what are you doing claim to your God
[1:01:16] to your
[1:01:17] God but he did not know that
[1:01:21] God the only
[1:01:23] God but Jonah
[1:01:26] knew Jonah
[1:01:28] recognized what was the
[1:01:31] problem but what did Jonah
[1:01:33] say he said well I'll get
[1:01:36] up cast me to the
[1:01:39] sea cast me to the
[1:01:44] sea Jonah didn't know that God had
[1:01:47] prepared a
[1:01:48] fish it's than do the will of
[1:01:53] God
[1:01:55] I'd rather a
[1:01:58] fish didn't know he had that
[1:02:02] trans God wanted to take
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:06] him all things work for
[1:02:10] good you will say I went to the
[1:02:15] world the will of
[1:02:18] God didn't want you to go to world I
[1:02:23] wanted if we say that God wanted us to
[1:02:25] go to the world then the word of
[1:02:28] God is contradicting
[1:02:33] itself blessed is the
[1:02:37] man who did
[1:02:41] not
[1:02:46] wied do you know the word of God
[1:02:49] brothers so God gives us permissive will
[1:02:52] his permissive
[1:02:53] will
[1:02:58] the word left
[1:03:01] me God gives us the free
[1:03:04] will
[1:03:06] not that we go out
[1:03:10] there it's the permissive
[1:03:13] will God allows us to the world and
[1:03:16] dirty ourselves
[1:03:18] up and when we come
[1:03:20] back many times we value
[1:03:23] salvation
[1:03:28] tell you young man go to the
[1:03:30] world so you know what's good that's a
[1:03:33] lie the
[1:03:36] devil to go to the
[1:03:39] world tell you I went to the world and
[1:03:42] I'm
[1:03:43] fine and now I know what the mercy of
[1:03:45] God is that's not true
[1:03:47] Brothers true because I was in the world
[1:03:50] God took me out of the
[1:03:52] world God why didn't I know you
[1:03:56] earlier done so many things that I did
[1:04:03] wrong scars
[1:04:07] healed the wounds
[1:04:10] healed but
[1:04:14] Scar and the Devil comes and reminds
[1:04:18] you and keeps telling you what you
[1:04:22] did but Hees
[1:04:26] and that blood is for
[1:04:29] us cleanses us
[1:04:32] all can say glory to
[1:04:36] God glory to
[1:04:39] God Jonah was
[1:04:46] there he was cast into the
[1:04:50] sea and even those who cast into the sea
[1:04:53] were afraid to do so
[1:04:57] you all know the
[1:05:00] story that
[1:05:02] fish
[1:05:05] him three days and three
[1:05:12] nights and he was there and he did not
[1:05:15] die he had oxygen I'm not sure how that
[1:05:18] how that
[1:05:19] went but it was God
[1:05:22] there God was
[1:05:24] to take
[1:05:26] him take him where he wanted to take
[1:05:29] him many of the times
[1:05:32] Brothers we're fleeing from the presence
[1:05:34] of
[1:05:35] God sooner or
[1:05:39] later if we're his
[1:05:43] seed we to get to that
[1:05:47] place glor glory to
[1:05:53] God
[1:05:59] I can imagine there I
[1:06:01] can I can imagine
[1:06:09] Jonah among so
[1:06:11] much in the belly of that
[1:06:14] will because everything that that
[1:06:16] will would rot in
[1:06:19] there how would Jonah be fighting
[1:06:21] against all
[1:06:23] that
[1:06:24] how would you want to
[1:06:27] be I believe
[1:06:37] Brothers as he was taking care of
[1:06:48] Daniel he would not
[1:06:50] beated by all those gases from the
[1:06:53] whales
[1:06:55] that's what I think that's what I
[1:06:57] believe and God was taking care of
[1:07:00] him because someone rest so long without
[1:07:04] breathing he was there three days and
[1:07:06] three nights so was God taking care of
[1:07:09] him so there
[1:07:13] Brothers when Jonah when the fish sped
[1:07:16] him
[1:07:17] out
[1:07:22] brother
[1:07:26] the fish the
[1:07:29] God it was the will of God for the fish
[1:07:31] to spit him
[1:07:37] out time com
[1:07:41] out I just wanted to make a quick
[1:07:45] question this is a general
[1:07:49] question how
[1:07:52] believe that was eaten by a
[1:08:01] fish believe that Jonah was eaten by a
[1:08:04] fish I read something about brother
[1:08:08] BR beautiful and I want to share with
[1:08:13] you because I thought it was
[1:08:20] beautiful beautiful and I hope you can
[1:08:22] capture this and everyone
[1:08:26] a little girl one
[1:08:31] time I believe brother rean said
[1:08:39] this in four while
[1:08:43] Tabernacle a little girl was saved and
[1:08:45] she was coming up from the
[1:08:47] street she had the Bible in her
[1:08:50] heart and she was simply
[1:08:52] singing
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:09:00] with her with her face
[1:09:04] Happ and she was
[1:09:13] singing you can imagine that
[1:09:16] Brothers was
[1:09:19] happy it says that this young lady was
[1:09:21] happy going around along
[1:09:25] said saying the
[1:09:26] Lord I'm
[1:09:29] happy and said are you
[1:09:34] saved Sav me and I'm
[1:09:37] happy are you saved question she found
[1:09:41] another person are you
[1:09:46] safe old man that was an
[1:09:49] unbeliever
[1:09:51] standing and they came
[1:09:54] and asked why are you so
[1:10:00] happy when they why are you so
[1:10:04] happy why because Jesus saved
[1:10:07] me I was
[1:10:11] baptized win
[1:10:16] souls because
[1:10:19] Jesus I was in the
[1:10:22] world I had no right toal life but God
[1:10:26] died for
[1:10:28] me said Jesus saved me oh I'm
[1:10:32] happy are you
[1:10:34] saved he
[1:10:36] said there's no such
[1:10:40] thing that's all you know about
[1:10:45] it well do you believe that that book do
[1:10:47] you have in your hands she had the word
[1:10:49] of
[1:10:51] God sir I believe all of it
[1:10:56] with the Holy
[1:11:00] Spirit he asked do you imagine
[1:11:03] that about Jonah the big yes sir I
[1:11:06] believe it's surely
[1:11:10] true how can you believe other than
[1:11:22] faith I was inside the
[1:11:32] World perhaps brother Jonah will not be
[1:11:35] what was he trying to say that if it's
[1:11:37] not in heaven where will it
[1:11:39] be in
[1:11:41] purgatory in
[1:11:43] hell so the young lady okay said
[1:11:46] okay Jonah's in heaven I'll ask him
[1:11:50] there heaven and if he's in hell
[1:11:54] this other unbeliever God bless your
[1:12:02] brothers amen God bless you
[1:12:05] Brothers it's a blessing to see each and
[1:12:07] every one of you
[1:12:09] tonight amen if you could please
[1:12:13] stand and open your Bibles to Psalms
[1:12:20] 18 when you have please say Amen
[1:12:26] the title for
[1:12:28] tonight is resisting God's
[1:12:33] will if there's one good thing that if
[1:12:36] there's one thing that we're good
[1:12:39] at that is resisting God's
[1:12:44] will fleeing from God's
[1:12:48] will you see because as human
[1:12:51] beings we must recognize
[1:12:55] that we have a sinful
[1:12:58] nature and this sinful
[1:13:02] nature a
[1:13:04] desire for the things of this
[1:13:07] world sinful
[1:13:10] nature
[1:13:11] Aire for
[1:13:16] Pride all of these
[1:13:18] things but thanks be to
[1:13:21] God that he's taking care of
[1:13:25] us amen the word says like
[1:13:28] this in my distress I called upon the
[1:13:33] Lord and Cried unto my
[1:13:36] God he heard my voice out of his
[1:13:41] Temple and My Cry came before
[1:13:45] him even into his
[1:13:48] ears amen you may take your
[1:13:51] seats amen how great is God God's
[1:13:55] love you see even when we might be in
[1:13:57] the times of
[1:14:01] distress times of
[1:14:04] Trials God is always
[1:14:08] listening and he is always willing to
[1:14:10] listen to
[1:14:11] us because he wants to help
[1:14:14] us amen amen tonight we are focusing on
[1:14:18] Jonah the
[1:14:22] prophet Book of
[1:14:24] Jonah is one of the most extraordinary
[1:14:27] books in the
[1:14:30] Bible you see the Book of
[1:14:32] Jonah it might be a small
[1:14:36] book only four
[1:14:38] chapters you see but I believe that the
[1:14:42] Book of
[1:14:43] Jonah shows the
[1:14:46] compassion and unfailing
[1:14:50] love that love that that God has
[1:14:54] towards his
[1:14:56] children you see in Jonah 1 verse
[1:15:01] one it shows that the word of the Lord
[1:15:03] came to
[1:15:06] Jonah saying arise and go to
[1:15:11] n and cry that great City and cry
[1:15:14] against
[1:15:18] it for their wickedness is come up
[1:15:21] before
[1:15:22] me
[1:15:25] now the city of
[1:15:26] nineve you see Brothers the city of
[1:15:28] nineve wasn't a small
[1:15:32] City you see no brothers you see the
[1:15:35] Bible says that it was a great
[1:15:38] City it was a big
[1:15:41] city you see but this city of
[1:15:45] nineve was in was deep in
[1:15:49] sin it was a perverted City
[1:15:54] you see brother Bram
[1:15:55] says
[1:15:57] n was a gentile
[1:16:01] City that worshiped
[1:16:04] animals and
[1:16:06] idols and you see n's
[1:16:09] God was the god of the
[1:16:12] sea which was the
[1:16:17] whale and God
[1:16:19] here SS
[1:16:22] Jonah to cry out against this
[1:16:27] city you see but Jonah 1:3
[1:16:32] says but Jonah rose up to flee unto
[1:16:39] tarish and went down to
[1:16:42] jopa and he found a ship going to tarses
[1:16:45] so he paid the fair thereof and went
[1:16:48] down into
[1:16:52] it
[1:16:55] to to go with him Onish from the
[1:16:59] presence of the
[1:17:00] Lord so here we can
[1:17:03] see that
[1:17:06] instead of
[1:17:08] going to where God instructed him to
[1:17:13] go here we can
[1:17:15] see that instead of going to
[1:17:19] n to preach to the
[1:17:22] people of
[1:17:24] repentance we see that Jonah chooses to
[1:17:27] run away from
[1:17:33] God a man running from God's
[1:17:38] presence think about that
[1:17:40] Brothers a man running from God's
[1:17:45] presence you see this man was a prophet
[1:17:49] too this might s this might seem and
[1:17:52] sound bad
[1:17:55] but brothers and
[1:17:57] sisters the more that we think about
[1:18:01] this the more that we understand this
[1:18:05] story the more that we will see and
[1:18:11] recognize that we are just like
[1:18:15] Jonah we're so much like Jonah
[1:18:18] Brothers you see there's always a little
[1:18:21] bit of Jonah in US
[1:18:24] you see Jonah is an example for all of
[1:18:28] us you see each and every single one of
[1:18:31] us including
[1:18:33] myself you see we are always running
[1:18:36] from
[1:18:38] something we are always running from
[1:18:43] something you see brother brandham says
[1:18:46] we are always running from
[1:18:49] something we run from troubles
[1:18:53] we run from
[1:18:56] responsibilities we are prone to do
[1:19:02] that if we could be honest
[1:19:05] tonight and if we could be honest
[1:19:08] tonight sometimes we run from God's
[1:19:12] presence but we don't recognize
[1:19:15] it now maybe tonight you could think
[1:19:18] that you don't do
[1:19:20] it you see but God knows your
[1:19:24] heart you see Brothers how many
[1:19:27] times we arrive to
[1:19:30] church and left church the
[1:19:34] same how many
[1:19:36] times have we arrived to
[1:19:38] church spiritually
[1:19:42] dead without any
[1:19:45] blessings with the same condition that
[1:19:48] we
[1:19:49] were how many
[1:19:51] times have we arriv to church
[1:19:55] physically like right now like right now
[1:19:59] how many times have we arrived to church
[1:20:03] physically but our
[1:20:06] minds are outside of
[1:20:09] church Desiring to do something
[1:20:12] else Desiring to do something that isn't
[1:20:15] of the
[1:20:17] Lord Brother
[1:20:19] sisters
[1:20:20] youth we are living in a Time
[1:20:25] where the things of this
[1:20:27] world social
[1:20:30] media
[1:20:32] addictions
[1:20:34] Pride
[1:20:35] Idols these
[1:20:37] secul
[1:20:42] artists and all these fascinating
[1:20:46] things are separating us from God's
[1:20:50] love you see we are living in a
[1:20:53] time where our own
[1:20:57] desires the desires of our
[1:21:00] flesh are separating us from the love of
[1:21:05] God you see our our
[1:21:08] flesh likes to flee from the word of
[1:21:12] God you see our
[1:21:14] flesh our flesh
[1:21:17] loves to run away from God's
[1:21:21] presence
[1:21:23] if we could all be honest
[1:21:25] tonight I don't know if any of you are
[1:21:27] listening
[1:21:28] tonight it is easier for our
[1:21:33] flesh to do our routine
[1:21:37] work it is easier for our
[1:21:41] flesh to spend hours on social
[1:21:46] media scrolling hours
[1:21:51] away easier for our
[1:21:55] flesh to listen to these secular
[1:22:00] artists you see it is youth it is easier
[1:22:04] for our
[1:22:07] flesh to give most of our
[1:22:11] day to our own
[1:22:15] desires how difficult it
[1:22:18] is how difficult is
[1:22:20] it is for our is it for our
[1:22:24] flesh to pray every
[1:22:27] morning every
[1:22:29] night how difficult is
[1:22:32] it for our flesh to
[1:22:36] read and meditate in the Bible in the
[1:22:41] word oh Brothers our flesh doesn't
[1:22:46] care if we spend countless hours out in
[1:22:48] the
[1:22:50] world hours out there
[1:22:53] there doing perverted
[1:22:56] stuff our our flesh doesn't
[1:23:00] care Oh but our flesh
[1:23:04] trembles when you want to dedicate at
[1:23:07] least 30
[1:23:10] minutes of your day to
[1:23:13] God why because the
[1:23:17] flesh fle from the presence of
[1:23:21] God you see when God told
[1:23:24] Jonah to go and give the
[1:23:27] message of judgment to the
[1:23:31] N I believe that Jonah was
[1:23:34] scared to confront the people of
[1:23:38] nin you see Jonah didn't want to go to
[1:23:42] nin you see brother Bram says Jonah what
[1:23:46] was asked to go to a gentile
[1:23:51] City to cry out against
[1:23:56] him thinking that he would not be
[1:24:01] received because the Gentiles would
[1:24:05] think what's this Jew got to do with
[1:24:08] us you see so
[1:24:11] Jonah with all these
[1:24:13] reasons all these
[1:24:16] excuses you he
[1:24:18] chose to flee from
[1:24:21] God Jonah with all these
[1:24:25] excuses to not go where God wanted him
[1:24:27] to
[1:24:29] go see the Bible says that Jonah rose
[1:24:33] up to flee to
[1:24:36] tares from the presence of the
[1:24:40] Lord
[1:24:42] Jonah was running away from his
[1:24:48] responsibility you see Jonah couldn't
[1:24:50] face his
[1:24:51] responsibilities
[1:24:54] and in the same way
[1:24:56] Brothers we can't face our
[1:25:01] responsibilities God has given us a
[1:25:03] responsibility in this world God has
[1:25:06] given us a responsibility in this
[1:25:08] world to separate ourselves from this
[1:25:12] world to act different from this
[1:25:16] world you see but it seems like it's
[1:25:18] hard for the
[1:25:20] Youth separ
[1:25:24] themselves because maybe they don't want
[1:25:26] to lose their
[1:25:28] friends maybe they don't want to lose
[1:25:29] their
[1:25:31] reputation maybe they don't want to lose
[1:25:33] their
[1:25:36] status their
[1:25:38] popularity and because of that we choose
[1:25:42] we choose to flee from our
[1:25:46] responsibil you see we have to
[1:25:49] understand God is sometimes going to ask
[1:25:52] ask
[1:25:54] us to do things that we don't want to
[1:25:58] do God is going to ask
[1:26:02] us it's going to ask us to get out of
[1:26:05] our comfort
[1:26:07] zone you see because it seems like we're
[1:26:10] comfortable
[1:26:11] tonight it seems like we don't have to
[1:26:13] worry about anything
[1:26:16] tonight you see but I know brothers that
[1:26:19] we need a
[1:26:21] change you see Brothers youth we get too
[1:26:26] comfortable with the things of this
[1:26:29] world we rely too
[1:26:33] much of the things of this
[1:26:36] world you see why Brothers you see when
[1:26:39] Jonah went down into the ship into this
[1:26:42] ship thinking that he could Escape
[1:26:46] God Jonah thought Jonah thought that he
[1:26:50] could go he could go the easy way fre
[1:26:53] from
[1:26:56] God you see but God never promised
[1:27:00] us that this life was going to be
[1:27:04] easy you see God God is going to send
[1:27:09] storms God is going to send send
[1:27:14] trials God is going to send some
[1:27:17] things that in our
[1:27:20] perspective is seems like God doesn't
[1:27:23] care about
[1:27:25] us oh but Brothers we are
[1:27:28] blinded we are
[1:27:30] blinded see God is trying to get our
[1:27:34] attention God is trying to get our
[1:27:38] attention and I don't know if he has
[1:27:40] your attention
[1:27:42] tonight I want to tell you
[1:27:45] tonight you
[1:27:47] see brother brandham said that Jonah
[1:27:51] took an easy ship and went down a
[1:27:56] tar he went down in the hole of the
[1:28:00] ship and went to
[1:28:03] sleep he took the easy
[1:28:06] route the easy
[1:28:09] way you see but by the grace of God
[1:28:12] Brothers God send a
[1:28:16] storm to straighten up Jonah's
[1:28:21] path you know what
[1:28:24] youth sometimes God needs to send a
[1:28:27] storm to
[1:28:29] us sometimes God needs to send a
[1:28:33] storm in our lives so that he so that he
[1:28:38] can get our
[1:28:40] attention you see sometimes
[1:28:43] God needs to send that storm in our
[1:28:47] lives to shake us up a little
[1:28:51] bit times God needs to send that
[1:28:55] store in our
[1:28:57] Liv so that he can put us in the right
[1:29:02] path you see Brothers we let our
[1:29:06] flesh we let our
[1:29:08] flesh dictate what we
[1:29:11] do we let our
[1:29:14] flesh and our
[1:29:16] thoughts
[1:29:20] us see we come to church Wednesday
[1:29:24] Friday
[1:29:26] Sunday week by
[1:29:29] week by
[1:29:31] month you see but we can't let God move
[1:29:34] in
[1:29:36] us we close our
[1:29:39] hearts our hearts are so
[1:29:43] hardened to the point where we don't
[1:29:45] want that fellowship with
[1:29:48] God but we choose to flee from God
[1:29:53] you know
[1:29:57] Brothers these past few
[1:30:02] months I've been struggling struggling
[1:30:09] spiritually I
[1:30:12] felt separated from
[1:30:17] God I was
[1:30:20] imprisoned
[1:30:22] by my own
[1:30:25] thoughts and
[1:30:28] desires the
[1:30:30] devil got a good hold of
[1:30:35] me throughout these past
[1:30:38] months and I was bound by my own
[1:30:45] flesh I did
[1:30:48] things that I knew that I shouldn't I
[1:30:51] shouldn't be
[1:30:53] doing but yet I did
[1:30:56] it I told
[1:30:58] God that I wouldn't do certain
[1:31:03] things but
[1:31:05] yet I would do
[1:31:08] it and at some
[1:31:12] point I had to
[1:31:16] recognize that I was spiritually
[1:31:20] dying
[1:31:23] and the same
[1:31:24] way the same
[1:31:27] way I know that there are people
[1:31:31] here that maybe are
[1:31:34] bound by
[1:31:37] chains maybe tonight
[1:31:39] Brothers you are
[1:31:42] bound by your own
[1:31:45] desires by the the your own
[1:31:49] flesh you see Brothers
[1:31:53] we are in need of a
[1:31:57] change I know I need to
[1:32:01] change if you may please
[1:32:04] stand God wants to use
[1:32:08] us each and every one of
[1:32:12] us it's no coincidence that we're
[1:32:16] here you see it's no
[1:32:20] coincidence that you're in this place
[1:32:22] right
[1:32:24] now you see God could have chosen other
[1:32:28] people to replace
[1:32:31] you you see but God chose each and every
[1:32:34] one of
[1:32:36] you God chose
[1:32:38] you before the foundation of the
[1:32:42] world you see I don't deserve to be
[1:32:46] here you see Brothers I betrayed the
[1:32:50] Lord many times
[1:32:53] I've lied to the Lord many
[1:32:56] times in
[1:32:58] youth we close ourselves too
[1:33:03] much from the presence of
[1:33:06] God God wants that fellowship with
[1:33:10] us God wants to spend time with
[1:33:13] you God wants you to open those
[1:33:18] doors but our hearts are too cold
[1:33:23] why cuz we free from
[1:33:26] God why do we run from
[1:33:30] him when he is all that we
[1:33:34] need he is all that we need
[1:33:37] Brothers you see the Bible says that
[1:33:40] when you
[1:33:42] recognize that God is all that you
[1:33:47] have then you could then you will
[1:33:50] know that God is all that you
[1:33:56] need you see our flesh desires this
[1:34:01] world this flesh desires the things of
[1:34:03] this
[1:34:06] world oh but youth brothers and
[1:34:10] sisters not just the youth but every
[1:34:12] brother and sister in
[1:34:15] here we don't have to stay in the same
[1:34:17] position that we are
[1:34:19] in we don't have to stay in the
[1:34:21] condition that we
[1:34:23] are you see the same the same
[1:34:27] power that Rose God from the
[1:34:30] dead that same
[1:34:32] power in US you see how we have a we
[1:34:36] have a decision
[1:34:40] tonight we have a decision
[1:34:43] tonight do we want to leave
[1:34:46] different or do we want to leave the
[1:34:50] same brother Bram said and a man running
[1:34:53] from the presence of the
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:57] Lord preached in
[1:35:00] 1965 then we can't run from it
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:06] nowhere he'll be right there just the
[1:35:10] same you can do
[1:35:13] it you see by his provided
[1:35:19] Prophet the one he ordained to go down
[1:35:23] there and call that
[1:35:27] message now looked like he could have
[1:35:29] sent another another
[1:35:32] Prophet but he ordained
[1:35:36] Jonah you see
[1:35:38] Brothers God could have ordained other
[1:35:42] people God could have replaced
[1:35:46] me with a better
[1:35:49] person you see because I
[1:35:52] feel I'm the worst sinner in this
[1:35:55] world I don't deserve his
[1:35:59] love I don't deserve his
[1:36:02] Mercy oh but
[1:36:04] Brothers when God when
[1:36:07] Jonah was in the belly of that
[1:36:11] whale I believe that he was in his
[1:36:13] lowest
[1:36:16] points he was in the lowest deepest
[1:36:20] point but even at his lowest
[1:36:25] point even in the time of his Affliction
[1:36:28] and
[1:36:30] distress God heard his
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:34] prayer if God heard the prayer of a man
[1:36:37] that was in a belly of a
[1:36:41] whale how much more can God do for us
[1:36:46] tonight God promised
[1:36:48] us that he was going to give us a better
[1:36:50] future
[1:36:53] you
[1:36:54] see God knows what's best for
[1:36:58] [Music]
[1:37:00] us this world has nothing for
[1:37:04] me this
[1:37:07] world will never satisfy
[1:37:10] me there's only one
[1:37:13] person that will be able to satisfy your
[1:37:17] heart that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:21] you see
[1:37:22] Brothers the Lord when he opens
[1:37:26] doors no one can shut
[1:37:29] it when he opens
[1:37:31] doors no one can shut it the devil can't
[1:37:34] shut it friends can't shut it your
[1:37:38] friends can't sh
[1:37:40] it you see God
[1:37:42] tonight wants you to stop relying on
[1:37:45] your
[1:37:48] friends stop relying on the things of
[1:37:50] this world
[1:37:53] stop relying the desires of your
[1:37:58] flesh rely on
[1:38:00] him and you will find
[1:38:03] out that only in
