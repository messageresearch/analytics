[Music] [Music] brother sister and i will be your king your god it's because i just want him to get to the point so i can yell. when i begin to shout they lose the point there are two things that i want to i want to highlight slide 22 please remember jeremiah is now old he's in babylon and i found one thing in common of these three individuals look at what ezekiel five one says three one three one they say this is moreover he's already in babylon and he said moreover he said unto me son of man i'll find this is [Music] you know when something like this so dramatic that the people of israel were going through they were they were stripped they were stripped from their homes uprooted from their homes enough to get food or their belongings foreign the holy spirit has wanted us to speak on these things word of god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] when you're uprooted my question is what's going to be left to you if they stripped you what would they find what would be left if they would take everything would you still have the joy that you have today that's why they could prophesy but his delight is in the law of the lord and his law that he meditate day and night you don't

jeremiah and he sees that the designated time is is near and he jumps for joy to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sacrifice and ashes and i paid him to the lord my god i made my confession and said it's sinned [Applause] is when you know that you should do something you don't do it that we [Music] judgments [Music] oh [Music] what about my brothers a way out there were two
