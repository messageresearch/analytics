[16:28] foreign
[16:31] [Music]
[16:56] [Music]
[16:59] neither to have my pastor interpreted
[17:05] so i thank the lord and my pastor for
[17:08] the opportunity
[17:13] so just as you are standing let's enter
[17:15] into the scripture
[17:21] and it will be in genesis chapter 50
[17:23] verse 20.
[17:26] if you can say amen when you have it
[17:45] into english our title is pit
[17:48] prison palace
[18:00] the scripture says like this everybody
[18:02] has it
[18:03] but as for you ye thought evil against
[18:05] me but god meant it unto good to bring
[18:08] to pass as it is this day to save much
[18:11] people alive
[18:27] celestial thank you for one more day of
[18:29] service
[18:32] it's an opportunity that we can prove
[18:34] ourselves to you
[18:39] and lord as the word is being spoken
[18:43] may there be ears i receive the word
[18:46] lord
[18:50] and there be hearts that can sow this
[18:51] word lord
[18:54] corazon and lord may you be with my
[18:58] brother fidel and brother vidal yes
[19:03] and our interpreters as well
[19:07] we put the service in your hands
[19:19] amen amen you may be cedar brothers
[19:22] hermanos
[19:31] now joseph's story brethren la historia
[19:33] de jose begins in chapter 37 of genesis
[19:40] so the end of the book of genesis
[19:45] so that's a lot of chapters that it
[19:47] takes up
[19:50] now joseph's story
[19:52] of jose begins with a dream amen
[19:57] maybe some of our stories
[20:00] historias maybe also begin with a dream
[20:15] but then he faces a lot of
[20:17] disappointments in life
[20:32] that actually got to live out their
[20:33] dreams
[20:38] he had his dream
[20:40] and he saw it fulfilled amen
[20:44] but there's something different
[21:01] so joseph was the son of jacob
[21:05] and i just want us to understand the
[21:06] family structure
[21:10] and his uh son of israel lies actually
[21:13] in syria
[21:18] and great grandson of abraham
[21:23] is that clear
[21:25] so joseph is a teenager
[21:53] he was married to two sisters
[22:10] and then they both offer their
[22:11] concubines
[22:15] to jacob
[22:17] to have more children
[22:20] because at a certain point they were
[22:21] both infertile right
[22:38] and
[22:39] that's good jace joseph was a favorite
[22:42] child born
[22:46] favorite child born
[22:52] from the
[22:57] so we see how the favoritism is coming
[22:59] down right
[23:02] and everybody knew it
[23:05] and you see in most ways
[23:16] but kids can smell a mile away
[23:37] can you imagine is isaac here is that
[23:40] kisak
[23:41] imagine rico brother let's get personal
[23:44] here
[23:46] enrico
[23:48] got a cell phone before you did uh
[23:54] if i was you i would be angry right
[24:00] maybe they favored him more
[24:03] you know or these things can keep
[24:05] happening brothers
[24:08] but make it personal to yourself
[24:12] and in genesis 37
[24:16] it says verse 4
[24:19] and when his brethren saw their father
[24:21] love him more than all of his brethren
[24:24] they hated him and could not speak
[24:26] peaceably to him
[24:44] where no one could speak a nice thing
[24:46] about you
[24:50] maybe you grew up in a home
[24:52] full of criticism
[24:56] and negativity negativity and harsh
[24:58] angry
[25:26] can anyone identify with that
[25:30] you know
[25:31] now here's what happened
[25:36] joseph had a dream about being exalted
[25:38] and esteemed even more than he already
[25:40] is amen josette sueno
[25:43] yes
[25:45] remember the sheaves that were inclining
[25:47] to his
[25:51] and you think that he'd have sense you
[25:54] said
[26:36] and now joseph comes and says want to
[26:38] hear about my dreams
[26:40] [Applause]
[26:42] can you identify with that
[26:45] and imagine his brother saying sure
[26:47] joseph we just want to hear about your
[26:48] dreams
[27:03] of course i want to hear your dreams
[27:06] but imagine joseph
[27:09] he's a little clueless don't you think
[27:15] but fast forwarding
[27:18] they want to kill joseph because he tell
[27:20] them he's going to rule one day
[27:26] but then they decide to sell him into
[27:28] slavery
[27:31] and they take the coats
[27:36] they strip it from him
[27:39] and dip it in goat's blood
[27:43] and they show their father and jacob
[27:44] assumes joseph's dead
[27:49] so at age 17 joseph is taken to a
[27:52] foreign country
[27:58] sold to one of the egyptian officials
[28:14] and now after all the betrayal of his
[28:16] brother and abuse
[28:21] let's read genesis 39 2.
[28:25] just the first parts
[28:28] and the lord was with joseph
[28:31] estaba jose and wherever the lord's
[28:34] presence is
[28:37] the lord's blessings amen
[28:40] that's why he says he was a prosperous
[28:42] man
[28:44] prospero now suddenly the invisible
[28:47] upper story of god
[28:50] is intersects with the turn of events in
[28:54] the lower story where joseph finds
[28:56] himself
[29:10] and in some mysterious way god makes
[29:12] himself known to joseph
[29:16] jose and this is important listen
[29:20] prime your faith a little bit
[29:24] in ancient days
[29:27] the gods of ancient uh pagan places or
[29:30] pagan deities los dioses paganos they
[29:34] were associated with particular places
[29:40] the god of canaan the god of moab or the
[29:42] god of the philistines
[29:48] but the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[30:33] the lord was with joseph
[30:37] jose it's like the lord has been with
[30:39] you
[30:42] amen amen
[30:45] the god of abraham brethren
[30:48] wants
[31:17] now potiphar
[31:19] recognizes this godly president's joseph
[31:25] jose joseph has leadership
[31:27] administration and management skills
[31:33] and it didn't take long for him to put
[31:35] him in charge of his house
[31:39] and joseph is completely trusted
[31:41] joseph
[31:51] just when you think things are going to
[31:52] take a turn for the better for joseph's
[31:54] life
[31:58] it takes a little housewife turn
[32:00] solamente
[32:08] now we know that i'm a spot potiphar
[32:10] yeah
[32:12] who was
[32:41] and joseph's her new target now
[32:43] jose blanco
[32:46] now oh then real quick here
[32:49] when jesus went to receive the holy
[32:52] ghost he got sent to the wilderness
[33:09] and we say brother brandon we know says
[33:11] christ jesus is the type of joseph amen
[33:15] jesus and now he is tempted here but
[33:17] look how remarkably he answers
[33:29] how then can i do this great wickedness
[33:31] and sin against god
[33:42] [Applause]
[33:50] or even be
[34:14] and the key word of the story of abraham
[34:30] what is abraham known for
[34:32] the question
[34:36] so
[34:37] faith has to do with abraham right
[34:42] but faithfulness
[34:46] has to do with joseph
[34:48] jose abraham shows us faith
[34:52] and now his grandson shows how to be
[34:54] faithful
[34:59] now listen what happens to too many of
[35:01] us
[35:04] when disappointment comes
[35:08] we allow disappointments
[35:12] and i'm closing now if my brother can
[35:14] get ready
[35:28] disobedience
[35:34] well god didn't fulfill his promise or
[35:37] what he told me over there
[36:00] this isn't how the dream is supposed to
[36:02] go
[36:05] and because god let me down
[36:09] i'm gonna do what i wanted
[36:36] so how will we respond
[36:48] but i'm going to steal an ace from my
[36:50] brother vidal
[37:11] [Applause]
[37:16] okay now i know that this works
[37:20] god
[37:33] i said it's good to be here right
[37:36] i don't know if you guys captured what
[37:38] brother isaac just said
[37:42] our god is not a territorial god
[37:46] he has no limitations
[37:59] certain people have certain gods
[38:24] where he stays with our parents or with
[38:26] our brothers and sisters
[38:30] but we truly never take them further
[38:32] than that
[38:35] hey man god bless you again amen you
[38:37] always bendiga it's good to be here es
[38:38] bueno estado you're awake
[38:43] prison palace
[38:58] this
[39:10] if we can go please
[39:40] is
[40:25] from the troubles
[40:26] they lost problems that's when you start
[40:28] to reveal yourself
[40:32] so something different in you
[40:35] then that's when all hell breaks loose
[40:40] genesis verse 23
[40:45] and it came to pass when joshua was was
[40:47] come unto his brethren
[41:05] pit kilo now
[41:06] the pit was empty perro
[41:09] estaba i want you guys to know that
[41:13] was empty
[41:15] estaba
[41:16] and then the the beautiful part pero lo
[41:18] hermosodes
[41:45] hearing how dysfunctional our family
[42:27] he says it in the message the statue
[42:34] [Music]
[42:42] they were all good
[42:56] um
[43:20] [Applause]
[43:39] going to our brother isaac
[43:43] well parents have
[43:45] certain favorites
[43:48] i've heard that
[43:50] ben said to me here here and there um
[44:00] and
[44:01] uh-huh
[44:03] that's very hard
[44:05] yes
[44:06] it's
[44:21] but then
[44:23] going back to the story
[44:26] joseph jose there was something special
[44:28] inside of it was special
[44:31] parents could see
[44:34] please disconnect
[45:24] for the miracles and the works and the
[45:25] gifts that we have
[45:29] same thing with joseph
[45:43] [Music]
[45:55] because that takes us back to the very
[45:57] beginning
[46:12] take the
[46:17] [Music]
[47:08] was cast into que josefo echado was
[47:11] where joseph's hell started
[47:15] because all of this happened
[47:18] right after the gift
[47:20] despised
[47:35] an act of anger
[47:38] act of jealousy
[47:41] how many get angry here juan said
[47:44] i i'm the first one
[47:46] you may say brother fidel
[47:49] you're very quiet
[48:03] but it's when we get closer to god
[48:07] oh hell brexit
[48:11] let me tell you this
[48:13] the devil doesn't care el diablo
[48:16] if you start to think
[48:31] was making his thoughts into actions
[48:36] bearing fruit of what he had inside of
[48:38] him
[48:40] and let me take you here
[48:42] ruben his brother
[48:44] suermano wanted to do good el cariano
[49:00] we could say was the most angriest out
[49:02] of all
[49:06] the youngest brothers
[49:12] get everything that he wants
[49:26] he says in genesis 32 verse 22.
[50:24] had lo que el tenia that made him
[50:27] different
[50:29] from the rest of his brothers
[50:33] and not only his brothers
[50:41] he was made and put amongst other slaves
[50:43] in the house of potiphar
[50:48] but
[50:49] people can notice when there's something
[50:52] la gente puede
[51:07] see it right away
[51:10] but it wants uh to put something in
[51:12] joseph's hands
[51:19] now youth i want you to connect right
[51:22] many times
[51:24] we may think that we're nothing
[51:27] but the world can notice when there's
[51:28] something
[51:32] those influences of the world try to
[51:34] bring you in not
[51:47] jose is
[52:16] that moment of pressure
[52:19] depression or peer pressure
[52:22] try something new
[52:25] why are you like that
[52:27] why can't you be like the others
[52:30] because joseph
[53:22] [Applause]
[53:40] him one time
[53:44] and again
[53:46] and again
[53:48] after day
[53:50] and it came to the past and she spoke to
[53:52] him oh yeah
[54:36] uh
[54:50] [Applause]
[55:18] but what our god has
[55:20] made over material
[55:23] material that will sail down trial get
[55:26] one that gonna break bear any trials
[55:30] the devil is going to do anything diablo
[56:00] to say
[56:28] it
[57:10] amen why
[57:13] there's a lot there and joseph
[57:15] jose
[57:17] and the devil yeah diablo try to burn it
[57:19] out
[57:21] and many times he tries to burn out
[58:01] god
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:11] god bless everyone
[58:13] uh
[58:14] like brother gustavo saying
[58:17] gustavo
[58:19] and brother isaac
[58:21] you know joseph was a dreamer jose
[58:25] and uh
[58:26] the devil sure did try to burn it out
[58:32] you know and probably be the most
[58:34] the most heated moment of a young man's
[58:36] life
[58:42] yeah the the young man
[58:45] uh
[58:46] that's exactly what the devil tried to
[58:47] do it's an exact
[58:53] you know this was a very uh being a
[58:56] young man
[58:58] uh this is a very uh a very trying time
[59:01] in their lives
[59:26] that their dreams are going to be uh are
[59:28] are going to be uh achieved in church
[59:40] i think that their dreams are going to
[59:42] become a reality
[1:00:26] a young
[1:01:07] that he believed
[1:01:22] that god can work
[1:01:27] [Applause]
[1:02:32] amen amen i like that it appeared
[1:02:35] palestinia
[1:02:37] like joseph's dreams
[1:02:40] jose
[1:02:41] his dream
[1:02:42] it looked like it became a nightmare
[1:02:57] i didn't know that it was supposed to be
[1:02:58] like this
[1:03:00] is
[1:03:14] that's really
[1:03:29] up those drinks
[1:03:31] they won't be able to burn them up
[1:03:34] oh because i got something
[1:03:38] can't be burnt up
[1:03:40] i got the holy ghost
[1:04:11] meal and god gave this to me he's yours
[1:04:13] melody and you can't take it away
[1:04:17] amen amen
[1:04:19] i like that you know when joseph gets
[1:04:22] into this home
[1:04:36] to the penthouse
[1:04:38] a la casa del foso the pinch house oh
[1:04:41] penthouse pint yeah yeah la casa de los
[1:04:44] galandes yeah it's
[1:04:46] it's a really nice place
[1:04:50] so he you know i imagine joseph
[1:05:03] the devil always tries to give you
[1:05:05] something prematurely
[1:05:08] he's always trying to give you something
[1:05:09] ahead of time
[1:05:12] he he doesn't want you to work for it
[1:05:14] say that again he doesn't want you to
[1:05:15] work for it
[1:05:18] he he's always trying to give you
[1:05:20] something easy
[1:05:22] you know something that you don't have
[1:05:24] to work for
[1:05:26] but you know when you don't work for
[1:05:27] something
[1:05:29] you just give it a little bit of time
[1:05:33] and you'll find out it's worse
[1:05:37] it doesn't take a whole lot to find out
[1:05:41] that that what doesn't take very long
[1:05:45] to achieve
[1:05:48] it's not worth a whole lot mucho valor
[1:05:50] oh you know and and this woman yesterday
[1:05:53] a polish pop ponafore's wife
[1:05:56] you see what she tries to do
[1:06:00] you know that's what she tried to do is
[1:06:24] she didn't get what she wanted
[1:06:27] oh so she throws this this huge tantrum
[1:06:43] that affects
[1:06:45] you see she she didn't get her away
[1:06:50] and you know an ineffective joseph yes
[1:06:53] jose
[1:06:54] hey man amen
[1:06:58] she didn't succeed
[1:07:00] because we understand
[1:07:03] that in the heat of the moment
[1:07:07] you know and i hear the moment
[1:07:11] you know that that
[1:07:12] that
[1:07:26] it was greater than the lust of the
[1:07:27] flesh
[1:07:31] but there was something in the soul of
[1:07:32] joseph
[1:07:34] jose that was burning even more
[1:07:38] it was bait was burning even brighter
[1:07:54] and it doesn't
[1:08:17] because everybody maybe they're like oh
[1:08:19] i see there was something about that guy
[1:08:36] you know
[1:08:50] will take care
[1:09:18] he didn't
[1:09:30] you see god knows what you're going
[1:09:31] through
[1:09:59] when he sees that joseph's not tripping
[1:10:04] yeah he that he didn't skip a beat jose
[1:10:07] you are the atlantean
[1:10:09] elsie you're coming out that's just how
[1:10:11] just how god wants us to watch
[1:10:27] imagine he didn't even put up a fight
[1:10:31] he went straight to prison
[1:10:34] he was like say that again he was like
[1:10:38] if this is where god wants me el dijo
[1:10:57] a slang they were from god and they're
[1:10:59] yours this bible
[1:11:01] this message that's inside it's from god
[1:11:05] i don't care who says whatever i can
[1:11:07] look at each other i don't believe it
[1:11:08] that's fine
[1:11:10] but
[1:11:24] i'm the god
[1:11:48] she probably challenged joseph's manhood
[1:11:50] at the time
[1:12:34] he gives you the
[1:13:16] if hell didn't work
[1:13:20] then i'm gonna freeze them out
[1:13:23] i'm gonna freeze them out
[1:13:26] i wonder if
[1:13:27] i wonder
[1:13:31] how many haven't gone through the moment
[1:13:34] for the moment through a cold spell
[1:13:36] donde estam frios you're just cold
[1:13:39] implemented sound free you know when
[1:13:41] things get cold
[1:13:45] they get a little difficult
[1:13:47] because things start freezing up
[1:13:51] they freeze up second you can't clap
[1:13:53] your hands no more
[1:13:56] you know
[1:13:57] you can't do a whole lot of things when
[1:14:11] because your mind just froze
[1:14:52] when you're not seeing forgiveness
[1:15:32] [Applause]
[1:15:37] jose wherever he went
[1:15:41] wherever he was
[1:15:43] i want to let you know
[1:15:46] that this was the key question
[1:15:48] this was the key of joseph's life
[1:16:02] so when you have something that is
[1:16:04] proven
[1:16:30] something has been tested
[1:16:59] you went through this world
[1:17:14] wherever
[1:17:28] they continue
[1:17:53] his service was first to god
[1:18:09] jesus christ served sinners
[1:18:24] and
[1:18:38] because when something
[1:19:36] it was the chains
[1:19:39] that were trying to hold them back
[1:19:43] it was the devil's power
[1:19:46] that's what was fading
[1:20:30] much further
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:34] much more than than just preaching
[1:20:36] behind the poopy es mucho mas que solo
[1:20:38] predicated
[1:20:39] i want to let you know
[1:20:42] i didn't understand that you
[1:20:44] know you know for the longest time
[1:20:49] and you know i i underestimated right
[1:20:51] appreciate it
[1:20:55] i i you could say i despised
[1:21:26] just speak
[1:21:35] god gave it to me
[1:21:37] he gave me my name
[1:21:40] and you know when i uh when god gave me
[1:21:42] some revelation
[1:21:45] i found out what my name meant

[1:21:52] i love my name me
