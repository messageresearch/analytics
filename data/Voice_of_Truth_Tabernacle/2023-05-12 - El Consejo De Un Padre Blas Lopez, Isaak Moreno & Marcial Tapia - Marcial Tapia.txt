foreign [Music] Brothers now the days of David unai that he should die and he and he charged the Solomon and his son saying is and keep and keep the charge of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his cup and his Commandments and his judgments and his testimonies that is written in the law of Moses that thou mayest prosper and all that thou doest and withersoever thou turnst thyself cuatro verse that the Lord may continue his word which he spoke concerning me saying If thy children take heed to their way to walk before me and Truth with all their heart and with all their soul thee shall not fail thee there shall not fail these said he a man on the throne of Israel we're going to be reading Proverbs chapter 3 verse 1. this is my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for Lanes of days and long life and peace shall add to thee let not mercy and Truth for safety bind them about thy neck write them upon the tablet of thine heart so Thou shalt find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding one of my brothers that are adults as well your word says that those that are in Christ are New Creations youth here before your presence help me especially Lord don't take away every bit of my beans speak for my heart is these words help my brothers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Brothers it confirms it even more for me that's what the word of God calls foreign Brothers [Music] and the prophet says in general it's required of an emergency uh action to be for what brothers the state of death many times that in that state you want to call the whole world I want to call everyone and primarily um [Music] United races Brothers foreign Brothers [Music] blessed be the Lord are you happy Brothers I want to read a little bit of this Brothers I didn't give the text to my brother but I want to read this oh I lost it thank you is the message perfect strength by Perfect week he says here's something that Comforts us there's something here that encourages of weakness encourages us from weakness they say if we get to heaven if we're able to stand or get to the point where we stand before the presence of God along with his church will be standing amongst people that were weakness or cast away from them people that didn't know anything Dios it's not odd that God that God Compares with sheep they say he says the Sheep is the most defenseless and harmless animals Mercy uh insufficient there's not another animal like the Sheep that's unable Brothers Listen Brothers the squirrel can hide it in a tree the dog can bite back the line can rip apart completely insufficient then God takes that person and begins to mold them and in that person in that person's life he does what his hands he does that he does his work now they speak because those lips aren't his they're of God yes and that person God forms a character because that here in the pulpits what we're going to take there what we're going to take to Heaven our character we're going to take to Heaven because [Music] the character that I have right now I can't get to heaven brother foreign come on the Old Testament s [Music] God is good [Music] Jesus Christ Brothers El pastor that's Isaac foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and you're in his kingdom Seattle fuertes it's not that we're too weak but we're too strong we have too much knowledge and God wants to take that away from us he wants to take it is that right we're too strong surrender ourselves before him Brothers I'm going to stop here God bless you I'm really happy to be here this evening amen it's a must to worship God Amen and as a subtitle I put the counsel of the father amen as as our brother was talking in here we see here um that David was giving his last instructions to Solomon instructions we see that um David told them that he was approaching death amen and we see as I was studying this I was saying that when people pass away their last words are very important you see everyone wants to know what what their what their last words are going to be their last words are last Everlasting amen you you know usually we want to know what are they going to leave us um what are they going to tell us what advice are they going to give because they've been they've been through more you see we see uh if we could imagine if my brother if our pastor was up here sinost and if this was his last preaching I believe all of us would be more attentive all of us would want to know exactly what he's what he's saying we wouldn't want to know exactly every word exactly to that last preaching amen and I believe when David was giving advice to his son and what his father was telling them amen you see I see something that I see in here is that the Lord blesses those who walk in his ways we see that David was telling Solomon that he needed to worship God Amen to follow his Commandments to follow the written rules that Moses had had gave Davis and I don't believe David was telling them that because he didn't know God you know I believe Solomon seen David's testimony it was his son amen he lived with them I believe he knew about God what I believe he was telling them here that he needed a personal experience with God he needed something to stir up inside David wanted him to have David something that and Solomon my son learned to know the god of your ancestors intimately is worship them and serve him with your whole heart and a willing mind for the Lord sees every heart and knows every plan and thought if you seek him you will find him but if you forsake Him He will reject you forever is you see this is the new international version that I read here and David's telling them he wants him to know him deeply amen intimately he doesn't want just know David's God he doesn't want him just to know who who he is to David when he wants his son to have experience many times as youth is you see we come to church and when you're preaching is we see our parents in that in the in their steps of the Lord and we want to live off of their experiences but we have to have our own testimony amen my own experience we're going to stay in the same spot I'm going to keep sitting on these benches I wonder why we're in the same place amen amen and it keeps saying verse 10. so take this seriously aura you see in English it says so take this seriously you see David wants him to know that this is serious it's serious that he has a close relationship with God you see and I believe every single one of our parents wants us to have a close relationship with God Dave you know many of us have been in the world maybe or maybe been in both places we maybe come to church we have to choose one amen we can't be in both and it says the Lord has chosen you to build a temple as a sanctuary be strong and do the work and it says then David gave Solomon the the plans for the temple and its surroundings including the entry room the storerooms the upstairs room the inner rooms and the inner Sanctuary which was the place of atonement is David also gave Solomon all the plans he had in mind for the courtyards of the Lord's Temple the outside rooms the treasuries and the rooms for the gifts dedicated to the Lord is you see we see here Aquino zamos cuenta that David gave Solomon almost everything to build this Temple and a lot of the times my parents gave us you know the word they gave us Bible studies they give us advice they almost give us everything but the only thing that they don't give us then no the only thing that they don't give us or can't give us is the work after amen that has to be in US amen we're the ones that have to put the words to build a spiritual Temple spirit I was talking to my brother Alex today at the barber shop we're kind of speaking about the word and we have to build a spiritual Temple here we have to build something for God we go to and worship him and if we read first Chronicles 28 20 a little more down it says then David continued be strong and courageous do the work don't be afraid or discouraged for forgive me Brothers for the Lord God my God is with you he will not fail you or forsake you he will see it he will see to it that all the work related to the Temple of the Lord is finished correctly you see we see here David advise Solomon not to be frightened amen about the size of the taskra you know building a temple or being a king amen fear can't immobilize us many times amen it could prevent us from doing something because of the job the task is you know the pressure of the situations we have fear amen and because of that we end up freezing amen we don't do nothing Nuevo amen see he's the one that's going to give us a strain so start working amen but we have to do something and I want to read a story real quick maybe some have heard it amen it says one day your Fox becomes became very hungry as he went to search for some food it is he searched high and low but couldn't find something that he could eat finally he has his stomach rumbled he stumbled upon a farmer's wall uh at the top of the wall he saw the biggest juiciest grapes he had ever seen they had a rich purple color Rico telling the fox they were ready to be eaten to reach the grapes the fox had to jump high in the air paral cancer as he jumped he opened his mouth to catch the grapes but he missed tried again but miss yet again he kept trying and trying a few more times but kept failing finally the fox decided it was time to give up and go home he walked away he muttered I'm sure the grapes were sour anyway you see many times we're in church amen we don't want to do nothing amen because we say oh if we do something oh they're not going to notice it anyways why am I going to do something amen that's right before my time finishes just something else that I seen and this was that yesterday God keeps his promises amen if we read if we read verse 10 and First Kings chapter two and put him and say what first or second uh second uh First Kings chapter two it says then David died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David oh yeah I'll just read it let me real quick and David had reigned over Israel for 40 years seven of them in Hebron and 33 in Jerusalem Solomon became a king and sat on the throne of David his father and his kingdom was firmly established oh that's not it amen you see we see here that God kept his promise amen and you see we see God's going to keep his promises in our life well God promises he's not going to take away God keeps his promises because he can't take him back amen and one way I was listening to the to the title that our brothers put on um for tonight we must worship God Amen I believe one way that we that we could do that is by serving amen our brothers and being there for them not just in our Circle that we have no solos but getting out of our comfort zone I'm talking to new people amen foreign he went to the dining hall and saw that even though the food was plentiful everyone's Health was bad one more time he saw her he went to the dining hall and saw that even though the food was everyone's Health was bad it La Salud he whacked his brain for a clue to solve this riddle uh um Enigma he then found that the inhabitants were given long long-handled landos to use while eating give slower bro he then found that the inhabitants were given long-handled laddles to use while eating this was such a difficult and awkward way to eat yes that hardly any food reached their mouth as a result they were starving after several meals in Hell the man was suddenly transported to Heaven at first he was overjoyed then he went to the dining hall and was dismayed to find that the same laterals were used there it is however everyone looked happy healthy and well fed but then he noticed that instead of trying to feed themselves yes their inhabitants were serving each others the selfishness of those in Hell had rap had [Music] their thinking to only focus on themselves and the generosity of those in heaven had enabled them to think of each other and in doing save each other you see we see two situations some were being selfish in other words helping and serving each other you see and if we just help each other out amen would be much better off [Applause] Hermanos Stan brothers and as you're getting there why don't you turn to your side it is time for me to worship [Applause] the scripture says [Music] but the hour of cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him it's a difficult time we're living to be able to worship God in the time in the present times we're living I don't believe it's impossible with all of our hearts one thing I like about King David he was a worshiper who was the worshiper since he was born because that is what he was taught [Applause] but if you have a problem or if you have problems um Santo you know foreign day by day hold on much you know foreign now a miramos we see Como Fayo King David felt right that he had the face because when you fail a consequences there are consequences but I'm going to tell you this brothers that God will never leave us He Loves Us independent independently look independent of what we do okay because Brothers this flesh it's very stinky do the things of this world so the pleasures of this world don't criticize of any problems I am a witness I'm a man as Elijah says he was a man of passion I'm also a man of passion foreign hear King David he goes to call it all of his kingdom porque because he was going to express what God has shown to David now Brothers God has not given us to guide them to produce God has given us the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ and many times [Music] and I put it because many times we come very easy the devil has heard us that he has not allowed us to be free but it's time to be free to be able to guide our children to the things of God brothers so that our children can see so that our children can see is listen listen to me for a little bit King David couldn't do it because he was a man of war and had nothing too much possibly we Hermanos okay and it's going to place us to feel something uh beautiful we're going to be wasting our time because God doesn't move through feelings just as God chose you okay Hermanos okay Brothers I'm going to read a little bit here and it says like this is and of All My Sons for the Lord has given me many things he had chosen Solomon in my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel is for I have chosen him to be my son and I will be his father how beautiful Brothers with all over your heart and it says moreover I will establish his kingdom forever my Commandments and my judgments as at this day now he is telling him to stop we have to work amen Brothers come on you uh I have to do it by my own choosing and he says to be constant the and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you forever now he is telling them bro it is an inheritance that we can leave that inheritance and it's a chain reactions to serve God you're gonna have children and what are you going to give to your team what are your children what father does it not hurt them see a son who's a drug addict or out on the streets prostituting them to do whatever they feel like what parent is if you're not careful foreign look at the advice of David to Solomon [Music] for the Lord searches our hearts what does that mean to say Holiness do you think you can hide from God do you think that what you're doing Secret is is knowing that God is searching my heart how beautiful it is foreign I am a very needy person myself but Brothers tonight and be allowing himself to be guided as well amen Brothers I know we're possibly accustomed to feeling a lot of things but the older I get Sonos to fight off anything that gets in our way if it's unbelief any problem s if we cry then we cry what's the problem God gave us eyes to cry if our heart hurts what is the problem God gave us a strong heart problem s am I going to give my heart you will give it to someone else okay foreign [Music] now more than ever before [Music] Lord Jesus Christ [Music]

what type of heart are we serving him we can serve him with a halfway heart many of us are serving him that way with a complete dollar heart it was his last words but I believe for David it was something great for David it wasn't any other thing that he was telling him it wasn't out of his sleep meditated on it very much if you seek it you will find it think about that security what are you saying there's an assurance what are you saying you will find don't you like to know that is insured two levels it's an insurance I will find it it's an assurance penetrate that in our hearts take that into our hearts if we seek him we will find him but my God the god of your father how beautiful is enjoy the story of David he was a great man a giant is it's very little what we talk about there
