[24:33] ruth joyce
[24:35] we i want to send you greetings from our
[24:37] pastor back home in phoenix
[24:42] in phoenix
[24:43] he sends greetings to everyone
[24:48] and likewise my father he sends his
[24:50] greetings along with my mother
[24:52] my father my mother
[24:55] i don't want to take too much time
[24:58] i know
[25:01] and uh even though i think the youth
[25:03] should be able to last longer than the
[25:04] older folks
[25:07] [Music]
[25:08] but i know how it is
[25:11] i i'd like to still consider myself
[25:17] since i have you standing can you please
[25:18] turn your bibles to genesis chapter 24.
[25:26] and to my understanding uh what what uh
[25:30] the focus for this evening was going to
[25:32] be on rebecca
[25:37] in rebecca and that the youth have been
[25:38] preaching lately on the characters of
[25:40] the bible
[25:45] so we don't want to come and break that
[25:47] continuity that you have established
[25:48] already
[25:53] so we want to start in genesis 24 verse
[25:55] 57
[26:01] when you have it if you can say amen
[26:04] 57 reads
[26:07] and they said we will call the damsel
[26:10] and inquire at her mouth
[26:16] and in other words we're going to bring
[26:18] the young lady
[26:21] and we're going to ask her the question
[26:25] without influencing her seeing
[26:27] influence without pressuring her tim
[26:31] but to put the decision for the rest of
[26:33] her life in her own hands
[26:48] and they called rebecca and said unto
[26:50] her we'll thou go with this man and she
[26:53] said i will go
[26:57] rebecca
[27:03] so to give this a title
[27:29] we thank you so much for another
[27:30] opportunity to be in your house lord
[27:32] gracias foreign
[27:34] to be worshipping here with like
[27:36] believers of the faith father
[27:41] that that love you so much lord
[27:45] that can serve you every day of their
[27:46] life
[27:50] and young people that make the effort to
[27:52] be at a youth service
[27:56] some of which don't even need to be told
[27:58] to come
[28:31] and we put everything in your hands in
[28:32] the name of the lord jesus christ
[28:36] amen amen you may be seated
[28:40] i'm going to just read 58 one more time
[28:42] well
[28:45] and they called rebecca and said unto
[28:47] her wilt i'll go with this man go ahead
[28:49] bro
[28:52] yeah
[28:54] pregnant
[29:06] so we should all know that rebecca is a
[29:08] type of the bride
[29:18] and i know that here this evening this
[29:19] is the voice of truth tabernacles
[29:24] and and i know this here is the bride
[29:28] and tonight i'm going to call you all
[29:31] rebecca
[29:34] rebecca i hope that you're identifying
[29:36] with rebecca espero
[29:54] and we know that the messenger was our
[29:56] prophet william branham
[30:00] william mary and branham and the message
[30:02] was to look for a bride for his master
[30:19] rebecca's here tonight
[30:22] uh will we go with this man
[30:25] hombre will we go with this man
[30:28] and rebecca said
[30:31] that i will go si
[30:33] i will go with that message
[31:15] that we're going to speak to you this
[31:17] evening
[31:19] there are like types of messengers this
[31:21] evening
[31:23] messengers that do not bring their
[31:25] messages
[31:28] messengers that do not bring messengers
[31:29] that do not bring their orders
[31:33] but they bring a message from the king
[31:36] del rey they mean a message from the
[31:38] lord
[31:40] and they're bringing that word
[31:43] unto the rebecca la rebecca unto the
[31:47] bride that we have this evening
[31:51] so now going to the message
[31:53] brother branham says
[31:56] he says what if a woman won't come with
[31:57] me elijah
[32:01] like it says in the bible when he's
[32:02] asking well what if the woman the bride
[32:04] doesn't want to come with me
[32:09] it was a very valid question
[32:12] because like we said the option is yours
[32:14] young sisters
[32:18] you said the young man the option is
[32:19] yours
[32:22] so rebecca could have said no so rebecca
[32:26] but i believe he was a little more wise
[32:27] than that
[32:30] he was he was told
[32:33] brother says
[32:35] he said then you're free of this oath
[33:07] so in other words he knew that she
[33:09] wouldn't say no
[33:11] yes
[33:13] because the angel of the lord was going
[33:14] to be with him
[33:17] and that holy spirit that was with him
[33:20] that holy spirit that was with our
[33:22] prophet
[34:02] and he met the beautiful rebecca
[34:17] they're getting in consecration to come
[34:19] bring a message
[34:23] it's just like right here he says how he
[34:25] begins praying
[34:28] he's waiting for the leadership of the
[34:29] angel of the lord
[34:33] because he's about to meet these
[34:34] beautiful rebeccas that brother
[34:35] branham's talking about
[34:39] that are going to one day be the bride
[34:41] of jesus christ
[34:45] you've got the potential today
[35:14] so like we said the minister's only here
[35:15] to deliver a message
[35:20] just to invite you into the lord jesus
[35:22] christ
[35:24] invite you to be a bride to the lord
[35:25] jesus christ
[35:28] of christ
[35:55] that's what i'm here for brother says
[35:59] and what was our brother branham
[36:02] he was our prophet
[36:04] he was the messenger
[36:06] he was the angel
[36:10] all these titles all these gifts
[36:14] and amen to every single one of those
[36:18] but at least to me
[36:20] but i believe
[36:22] greater than all those things
[36:32] [Music]
[36:38] here to
[36:52] a leader
[37:20] to serve the duty he was set forth
[37:25] and that was just to send a message
[37:29] there's a king seeking a bribe
[37:34] there's a lord seeking a wife
[37:38] and he's only looking for one kind of
[37:40] bribe
[37:44] for virtuous rebecca's to take as his
[37:47] queen una rebekah
[38:00] and the gift of serving it comes in many
[38:02] different ways
[38:05] you know as we were taking that long
[38:06] 15-hour drive over here
[38:10] [Music]
[38:12] we were talking a little bit about
[38:13] serving
[38:16] and the gift of serving
[38:18] and yes it comes in very different forms
[38:21] different formas
[38:22] was just telling us
[38:25] that he's got amazing ministers that
[38:27] come and speak to you all week in and
[38:28] week out okay
[38:30] ministers
[38:33] but this is only a part of the work up
[38:34] here
[38:38] he said i depend more upon what they do
[38:40] off the pulpit than on the public
[38:52] was sent with the ministry to serve and
[38:53] deliver messages
[38:58] and he fulfilled
[39:11] and rebecca too had a ministry of
[39:13] surveys
[39:17] her her serving
[39:20] is when she came and she gave water to
[39:22] those camels
[39:25] my brother was telling me in the back
[39:31] how much water each camel depended upon
[39:35] cameo you know we're joking in the back
[39:36] thinking wow this rebecca must have been
[39:38] a pretty strong woman
[39:43] i don't know if she had big muscles or
[39:45] she carried it on her head
[39:50] one way or another that gift of serving
[39:52] gave her the strength to do what she was
[39:54] sent to do una forma
[39:58] not just that she was sent to feed a
[40:00] laser the messenger
[40:05] so how is that messenger in her home
[40:08] so i found
[40:43] and you don't need an invitation to get
[40:45] to that wedding
[40:48] because you are the bride you slandov
[40:52] you're the one that's getting married to
[40:53] that king
[40:56] brother branham says
[40:58] he said once again
[41:00] go get that bride
[41:04] that's the duty
[41:29] 1962-1962
[41:33] july 8th julio ocho brother branham says
[41:38] and quickly as soon as she heard about
[41:39] isaac
[41:43] in cuando escucho de isak
[41:45] before she had ever saw him antes
[41:51] she said hey adijo can you guess what
[41:53] she said
[41:55] i will go yo
[41:57] like we read in the scriptures i will go
[42:15] all you had to do was believe in jesus
[42:20] rebecca didn't have to see those
[42:22] features
[42:27] rebecca didn't have to hear that
[42:28] masculine voice that was good
[42:32] she didn't have to see that big body
[42:33] noise
[42:35] but she just accepted the message that
[42:37] was given to him
[42:40] and she put into effect this tiny little
[42:43] thing that each and every one of us
[42:44] should have
[42:46] es
[42:49] which is faith
[42:52] she put her faith in that messenger
[42:55] she put her faith in that message
[43:50] see that was abraham's brother's child
[44:07] showing that the church in the last days
[44:12] will be blood relation to jesus christ
[44:19] that's talking about us tonight
[44:33] that's why we turn our hair to see
[44:35] where's it coming from
[44:39] because we are predestinating
[44:43] when we as sheep
[44:45] we hear the pastor's voice
[44:48] and
[45:14] it's now that his blood flows through my
[45:16] veins
[45:44] that blood made me his kindred essa miso
[45:48] his kindred miso
[45:51] that blood may be a part of his dna
[45:58] so when the laser
[46:14] he was told specifically not to go out
[46:16] into the world
[46:20] go to the canaanites
[46:24] the the sodomites and whatever was out
[46:26] at that time
[46:29] he was told no no no you go to my people
[46:34] [Music]
[46:36] our prophet was sent unto the churches
[47:08] to bring out a bride for himself
[47:11] and he said rebecca come out
[47:14] bridegroom awaits you
[47:17] but continues
[47:19] and rebecca is rebecca as soon as she
[47:22] heard of isaac
[47:25] she there was something in her that
[47:26] pulled her straight to him
[47:31] and though she hadn't seen him or
[47:32] nothing
[47:36] she yet wanted to go by her own choice
[47:42] away from her mother and away from her
[47:44] brother
[47:47] is your mother have you forsaken your
[47:49] mother and father tonight as they say
[48:05] to put on the name of our lord jesus
[48:07] christ tonight

[51:30] do you believe that
[51:32] you young people came here tonight
[51:48] to hear that call of the holy spirit
[51:53] brother branham says that's the reason
[51:55] why i think today

[52:19] people yes
[52:25] they've made their decisions brother

[52:30] they're going to go out and go out
[52:33] regardless if the rest of them don't go
[52:35] out independent

[56:00] amen
[56:17] from being able to make that decision
[56:20] this is a question
[56:22] this is the question
[56:25] will you go with this man
[56:27] this is a question
[56:38] [Music]
[56:40] i like what our pastor told us about two
[56:41] fridays ago this is
[56:56] i like what the pastor said he says is
[56:57] you know the devil makes us think many
[56:58] times that we have we still have time to
[57:00] settle with the lord
[57:02] in other words
[57:05] the devil plays with our minds
[57:08] he plays with you and i
[57:10] say he tells
[57:22] how many how many uh children are dying
[57:24] of the war
[57:29] and today is a day to make that decision
[57:35] you haven't accepted the lord jesus
[57:36] christ in your heart
[58:06] is
[58:34] we still have time to settle with the
[58:36] lord
[58:45] he makes us think that things are going
[58:46] to remain the same that is the devil's
[58:48] strategy
[58:51] stink brothers
[58:53] that everything's going to be okay
[58:58] we're going to be okay
[59:01] but let me tell you tonight
[59:15] today is
[59:30] and how this
[59:44] [Music]
[59:55] [Music]
[1:00:09] i remember that i was very young
[1:00:55] there are there are characters
[1:00:58] there's abraham the father
[1:01:00] isaac the son rebekah rebecca the bride
[1:01:04] eliza the servant
[1:01:06] hermano
[1:01:08] and laban
[1:01:18] and one thing that catches my attention
[1:01:22] isn't abraham's decision
[1:01:25] abraham had to take how to make it
[1:01:30] he he he realized that his son needed a
[1:01:32] bride
[1:01:36] and
[1:02:18] or it says in verse two it says and
[1:02:19] abraham said unto his eldest servant of
[1:02:21] his house that ruled over all that he
[1:02:23] had yes
[1:02:27] so he sent eliza
[1:02:30] and this is a number one point
[1:02:55] like this and the servant took ten
[1:02:56] camels of of the camels of his master
[1:02:58] and departed for all the goods of his
[1:03:00] master were in his hand
[1:03:03] and they already explained to us of the
[1:03:05] of the gifts
[1:03:07] these guests brothers
[1:03:09] amongst these gifts
[1:03:13] when is the will of god
[1:03:27] and the most tremendous thing was how
[1:03:28] they felt
[1:03:42] when
[1:04:09] says and he said oh lord god of my
[1:04:10] master abraham i pray thee send me good
[1:04:12] speed this day and shoot kindness unto
[1:04:14] me and to my master abraham
[1:04:18] and there was a servant
[1:04:20] and he began to pray
[1:04:24] and he began to pray and
[1:04:38] i heard these people
[1:04:50] and the wind begins to blow
[1:04:52] it
[1:05:04] i know the judah scripture yeah
[1:05:20] and the wind blows
[1:05:47] because god vindicates
[1:06:28] i believe that there's examples here
[1:07:10] bracelets on rebecca
[1:07:27] is these characters uh what is uh the
[1:07:29] mother of rebecca
[1:07:31] and laban
[1:07:34] it says that the mother typifies a
[1:07:35] church
[1:07:37] they were they were uh putting a a snare
[1:07:54] taker
[1:07:56] and in parentheses
[1:08:00] maybe maybe levin wanted a little bit
[1:08:02] more money
[1:08:05] so then
[1:08:39] with us a few days at least at least 10
[1:08:41] after that she shall go
[1:08:45] that's what the devil does
[1:08:47] he tells you wait that's woven you're
[1:08:49] young
[1:09:02] it's pretty much he's pretty much
[1:09:03] telling him let's tell him to wait a
[1:09:05] little bit
[1:09:07] but rebecca brothers yes
[1:09:11] she was waiting brother
[1:09:18] she had already spoken with eliezer
[1:09:20] yeah
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:23] and she already knew who her isaac was
[1:09:29] and and look at this brother
[1:09:31] nada and there's nothing
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:10:13] and day after day we reject him
[1:10:17] rebecca rebecca
[1:10:19] rebecca rebecca
[1:10:25] she's simply by what she heard from
[1:10:26] elijah
[1:10:40] because she knows
[1:10:56] oh
[1:11:10] to tell you i stopped to suck there's
[1:11:13] your isaac
[1:11:15] and this is how she was
[1:11:18] she that's how she was yes
[1:11:22] and he said don't don't keep me here
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:06] because we're so
[1:13:16] to play
[1:13:28] and if the rapture happens today
[1:13:44] i'm thinking about going to go get a
[1:13:45] coffee
[1:13:48] or going to the outside to go talk with
[1:13:50] a brother or sister
[1:13:54] don't misunderstand me it's fine
[1:13:57] but this is more important
[1:14:25] i haven't regretted
[1:15:07] don't think that there's more time
[1:15:17] [Applause]
[1:15:47] and that's the question brothers
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:16:14] and this is where rebecca looked up or
[1:16:16] lifted her up her eyes
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:37] there is nothing that can take the place
[1:16:38] of the lord jesus christ no no no no no
