Micah chapter 5 verse 2. Israel though they'll be little among the under thousands of Judah a year out of thee shall come shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel whose goings forth have been from old from Everlasting let's pray Brothers Lord Jesus Christ giver and creator of Life first and foremost we give you thanks for every one of your marvels of your miracles for your grace moving freely take away any incorrect word from my mouth and that my brothers but they don't take me by what I say what I'm trying to convey what I'm trying to express thank you for everything congregations and along with my brother Alex this small talk came to me pick and yeses small things yeah um if you can put the image up you can put the image up on the screen okay let's see if you can see it is [Music] this is simply just a small diagram or an image and this is amongst others right that was before they were taken into captivity and one of these prophets or some of these prophets they were able to see that first temple Solomon constructed right and then comes these profits that were prophets during the time of captivity is Jeremiah yes um they took them captive and he lived there for around 60 years and when he leaves there he's uh he's an elder already but then he comes or then comes the the prophets from the post captivity and that's um now these two haggai and Zechariah and they're able to see or their their task was to encourage the people for the Reconstruction to encourage encourage them to forget what happened [Music] not be regretting but they that they look forward that they have a new vision but that I want to meet it right now the book of haggai is and Zachariah they speak about a very special person a person is right we've just read the scripture that scripture that says it says for who has despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and this captures my attention if you can put the following image iberan Ada and shall see the plumber in the hand observable he is also a type of the seventh messenger of the seventh Angels what is a plummet made it construction a plummet is a basic instrument used in construction work in construction they know what a plummet is also a tool that's used in high Precision it doesn't need any kind of adjusting with this weekend we can see if the if the wall is completely vertical straight up and down if it's not off to the side a little if it's not off center is also being the seventh angel s placed in charge it says [Music] in other words just as the seventh angel did because there came a moment when the word of God is derailed in the last days in the wrong way they they the Gracia this is a message of Grace but it's also a message where it reconstructs everything where all that had that had gone off to the side look many times at the plans of God we want them to align with us with our way of living but it's not that way it's us what has already been spoken glory to God Amen brother now look but there's another thing here that captures my attention in Zechariah 4 10. um priesthood last Sunday with her brothers for who had despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice that's where we're going to basis our thought off of when they begin to rebuild the Temple those Elders that they were able to see the temple of Solomons because they they begin to see that that temples was buildings it didn't look like anything they had seen before and that's when they begin to unappreciate those Small Beginnings those small things we as Christians we we serve a great God a majestic a God that's powerful a god that is however God even God with all of this greatness all of this he has a great love for lopeño for the small things for the things that are small he puts his eye on small people in small places including the son of God he didn't equal himself to be the same as God as something to grab a hold of but he made himself small to give us salvation look the kingdom of God or the work of God it doesn't start in the great things or in the greatest thing but it starts in the smallest Community God begins in the smallest in the smallest of things his kingdom and that in one day that it would cover the entire Earth it begins with an elder and a sterile woman with Abraham and Sarah and with the promise Isaac do you see how God starts with the smallest things he doesn't unappreciate Abraham being an idolater a bit of that right he also starts and it grows his people a small people right look what Deuteronomy 7 7 says the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you you were more a number than any people for you were the fewest of our people but because the Lord loved you and because you would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers have the Lord brought you out with the mighty hand and with and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt now look at how God starts from the smallest thing is and he he elects these 12 common men ombres these illiterate without having studied but he takes him to something right right and this end of the year this time of the end of the year Christmas is drawing close icosas there are things that we get more importance too but we forget the small things we forget the small things and we focusas Grandes on the great things on the bigger things but God says truly the day of small things is coming but up until that point let's not let's not disregard but they are small things and look mm-hmm sort of I will observe a bell termina the construction he finishes building the Temple but God Tiempo Express afterwards afterwards amen he sends the greatest of his temples and the person of the Lord Jesus Christ significant in flesh yeah I'll see us in my door is preparados these men were prepared they they unappreciated or despised thank you they couldn't see that God was going to dwell but there it was there was God crying and they couldn't see it but you know his children they will see those small things I perceive that you're a prophet is my parents and my ancestors speak of a promised Messiah of Christ just because anything is small okay perceptively that is not noticeable Jesus but Jesus said that even a sparrows OS who has two of them sold for a fourth of a penny and not one of those little birds could fall to the ground without God knowing it Joseph God notices little things how many times you say I can't do very much about it the conditions of today but just a little kind word to someone an invitation a little testimony little kind Smiles or agreeing to a pastor significance might mean more than you think it does the late King George visited the provinces and while he was in the province of British Columbia all the teachers turned the children out from school that they might go and see the king and being that His Highness the King was there why they they all had the flagship the tools play their patriotic feelings towards him is the little children were supposed to weigh the flag as the king passed by and after the king would pass back the teacher came out and found one little bitty girl standing over on the corner with her little head against a Telegraph and we've been like her childish heart would break and the teacher went to her para controller to comfort her and she said what's the matter honey could you not wave your flag foreign she said I did Wave My Flag and I did see the king but I was so little that the king didn't see me but it's not that way with Christ how insignificant he sees every move Lord Hallelujah he disposed he disposed of all of his greatness to give salvation to us that's not let's not despise the the Small Things great things come forth yes God bless you Brothers [Applause] invite you to stand so you can stretch foreign who has believed our report is and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed is for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he shall hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him is Ro femenos presiado he uses spies and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not amen you may be seated is their mentality and way of seeing things have changed they no longer seen the second temple as something great they told himself this is all we've done is this is and God doesn't see much value in it all right their perspective was changing the leaders they were changing foreign but there would come a day it's a time in which people are preparing for Christmas and it's impressive to see the people of what they give priority to [Music] does the sister not buy anything different whoa come on it's astonishing to see how the people Nothing of importance [Music] perhaps some good tools to use and although it works they want something new foreign and the things that actually have value we see them as small brother Brandon says in the message why little Beth for him he says I'm so glad that even just a little insignificant things in the Bible is the insignificant things in the Bible means so much that God sees is great the prophet continues to say foreign ER matters of the law because he's quoting a scripture of how the people in the time that were there they were giving so much importance to the temple they cannot systems but they weren't focusing on the small things they had seen the first temple is how was the church how's the people going to go to this miserable don't we have that same mentality sometimes together because what you did yesterday at night then when you're in church what do you do in church sometimes these brothers that matter more and they have a greater impact are you with me this morning that he chose a small place a small town to live in or to be born God is so simple yes [Applause] that he chose to both reveal himself and hide himself in Simplicity God is so simple yes that people overlooked that simplicity foreign what God is doing Israel when the people of Israel is that was going to come and deliver them from slaves God sends to them a baby I'll go insignificantly something insignificant look Brothers sometimes we we get Pride for it we both because we know the message because we know God this is so true trying to point ourselves trying to say that this is a mystery well really it's something very simple it looks as though it's simple but it's something very profound very deep inside many people said and I asked the question what is the message what is the message where is the message where's the message this morning amen foreign stop doing who has believed our report people were unable to understand the reports what God wanted to transmites something that must be announced because it wasn't the way that they wanted it to come on we say no it's because how does God have this program and it simply just doesn't fit in our mind s they were unable to imagine unable to capture in their minds that God was changing in dispensation that God changes but his not his mind dispensations that's why I can't stay with the message of the past you know when God is changing we're living in the end times and there are people are waiting for something that's already here amen ities sometimes we don't understand such small things this is message Brothers he says in the message or he says simple he says God hiding himself Siempre acido enumildad the way that God works with the man has always been in humility you're in the wrong church but I'm not going to say that is for people that are simple listen prophetic but with a prophetic ear oh my God thank you so much simply it's not that you come with your cheapest clothes try to look nice I've seen so much I've seen people that dress so nicely that don't have a dollar in their pocketives another um yeah it's okay let's look at what brother Branham says the way that God works with the man has always been in humility he never works with a man in great theological terms that's where the problem lies with us the religious churches they're pulling their hairs out over theological things foreign over one doctrinal point tell me of an occasion no it was that way he's never done it He makes himself simple but man wants to make him complicated He makes himself great by making himself humble it's good and that's how God works God works in simplicity and this is sometimes we forget that Brothers sometimes we get the spirit of oh I'm of the message I have the highest level of revelation today because the people of that time they were never able to understand that the deities would be in a man is people were looking for something Supernatural would be incarnated in a man in the in the boy how tremendous God hiding himself in simplicity says I don't have too much time studying this message I know that there are more theologians when I started I went directly to the seals because I wanted the The Good the the more the meat it's been by your grace and you called it son and you came to redeem me what are the small things for you sufficiency come forward I'm closing is they couldn't understand the deity because as a deity revealed itself it wasn't in the way in which they expected it to be foreign [Music] [Music] I'm at nowhere sometimes we create complexes and things you create your own world that God has never created your own ideology yes sir God has nothing to do with it yes God says he begins to take out what he has not created sir Tiempo navigo and then this Christmas time [Music] do you want your house with your declarations that's okay Brothers [Music] what is the true meaning [Music] where should we be [Music] yes at this time in this end time foreign [Music] we're gonna have a greater impact if people were to tell you I see something different you don't celebrate Christmas like the rest of it may God help us in these times [Music] with the spirit of the world this I'll be closing brother Branham says [Music] this deity is in you I'll repeat it he says that the deity is in us and that's what they couldn't understand that's what people can understand that's what people can understand in our profit they couldn't [Music] in the denominational Church they can accept that God manifests himself in flesh over 2000 years and that's the that's the wrong part that's the area is that they have a historian they deny that the day of today God continues to manifest himself in flesh [Music] a little more in the world but ye shall see me [Music] don't fear little flock [Music] because unto years to understand to know the kingdom to understand Brothers It's Not only to see but to Nowhere to understand it [Music] until the end of the world Christ in a Manger gives a question and he says Christ in a Manger yes [Music] it's okay that you have something that that means Christmas that's okay don't just have presents have something significant [Music] let's see what they give me no brother Branham says [Music] but Christ in you hallelujah hallelujah and he says we're not we're not worshiping but Christ to you [Music] he says we're worshiping Christ in you you know what he's saying and he says the Holy Spirit [Music] the hope of Life who is the hope of life foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] we it hasn't been manifested where we ought to be he says [Music] what would a great day be like when we're truly manifested you're manifesting yourself right now we should be manifesting what we are but what about when that day comes when you are completely like him this is message Brothers [Music] for me to be completely like him you have the same life and that life is in the body [Music] that's worship Him Brothers [Music] and that God help us so that in this time so throughout this time you can have a significance a correct meaning of what Christmas is please stand up my brother and start worshiping him start right there [Music] amen this was our Glory yeah [Music] [Music] you ain't situation foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
