[22:52] 11.
[22:54] [Music]
[23:07] for the opportunity
[23:20] and those congregate
[23:24] it says like this
[23:29] is
[23:32] Mio
[23:41] disquieted Within Me hoped on God for I
[23:44] shall yet praise him who is who is the
[23:46] health of my countenance and my God
[23:52] this is the apostles chapter 13 verse 21
[23:55] and 22.
[23:57] as a title this evening my brothers and
[24:02] myself this is
[24:05] waiting upon your day waiting for your
[24:08] day this is
[24:17] and after with the desire to King and
[24:19] God get God gave unto them Saul the king
[24:22] of the son of sis a man of the tribe of
[24:24] Benjamin by the space of 40 years
[24:39] and when he had removed him he raised it
[24:41] raised up unto them David to be their
[24:43] King to whom also he gave testimonies
[24:45] that I have found David the son of Jesse
[24:47] a man after my own heart which shall
[24:49] fulfill all my will you may be seated
[24:53] may the Lord
[24:58] we've already preached to us previously
[25:01] Israel was in a situation
[25:04] we're going to put it that it was
[25:07] they wanted to denominate themselves as
[25:11] the rest of the Nations
[25:16] and because Samuel was old yeah
[25:21] as a priest or judges
[25:24] but they weren't doing it according to
[25:26] the word of God Dios
[25:40] even though he was King of the Jews he
[25:44] was a king of Israel
[25:47] and we see in Deuteronomy 17 14 and 15.
[25:50] see what Moses wrote
[25:53] before they crossed the Jordan
[25:56] verse 14 says
[26:07] when they are coming to the land which
[26:09] the Lord thy God giveth thee and shall
[26:11] possess it and shall dwell therein and
[26:13] shall say I will say the king over me
[26:14] like as all the nations that are about
[26:16] me
[26:29] in any way set him King over thee whom
[26:32] the Lord thy God shall choose one from
[26:34] among thy Brethren shalt thou said King
[26:36] over thee thou mayest not set a stranger
[26:38] overly which is not thy brothers
[26:42] so here we see that the word of the Lord
[26:44] is perfect perfect because God is
[26:46] perfect
[26:47] God is not going to be surprised
[26:50] he's not going to be surprised by
[26:52] anything we're thinking
[26:54] anything we're doing
[27:00] we do things that we don't want our
[27:02] parents our brothers
[27:07] but the one we have to hide from we
[27:09] can't hide from
[27:11] and we're only going in circles
[27:16] and we can
[27:27] you're free
[27:30] no they wanted a king
[27:35] in the first Samuel 9 16.
[27:40] 17
[27:48] that he was going to send someone
[27:51] that he was going to be the king of
[27:53] Israel
[27:54] so God was working
[27:59] and chapter 9 says
[28:02] that the father of saw he he lost some
[28:06] some oxen
[28:09] but there we see the hand of God
[28:12] [Music]
[28:13] because uh Saul's father
[28:17] he didn't send to service
[28:29] verse 16 says
[28:50] Pueblo
[28:53] tomorrow about this time I will send the
[28:55] Amanda of the land of Benjamin and thou
[28:57] shall anoint him to be a captain Over My
[28:59] People Israel that he may save my people
[29:00] out of the hand of Philistines for I
[29:02] have looked upon my people because their
[29:04] cries come unto me and when Samuel saw
[29:06] when Samuel Saul the Lord said unto him
[29:09] behold the man whom I spake to thee of
[29:11] this this same shall reign over my
[29:13] people
[29:16] I want to read a quote from the prophet
[29:18] uh
[29:21] in this great warrior David preaching
[29:23] 55.
[29:27] yes
[29:35] but now Israel wanted to impersonate the
[29:37] other people and that's what the church
[29:38] wants to do to him personally they come
[29:40] back slitting condition in this
[29:41] condition then what did they do is
[30:02] they went to find their King and when
[30:04] they did they found the biggest
[30:05] handsomest man they could find great big
[30:07] seven footer with black shaggy hair dark
[30:10] sparkling guys that would be attractive
[30:11] to the people and they thought he'll
[30:13] make a wonderful King is
[30:33] But as God said to Samuel looketh
[30:36] but as but God said to Samuel man look
[30:38] at on the outward appearance but God
[30:40] looketh on the heart when Israel uh
[30:42] selected their King they wanted a great
[30:43] big handsome strong looking fellow with
[30:45] big shoulders and straight standing Head
[30:47] and Shoulders above all of his armies
[31:07] but when God selected his King for them
[31:10] a little Ruddy sapling looking kind of
[31:11] fellow looked a little like a and
[31:14] that was God's pick of it what a
[31:16] difference see the difference in it
[31:17] that's just the way God does things
[31:18] sometimes in such ways as so country so
[31:21] different from what we think
[31:26] with these things in the Bible in the
[31:28] message
[31:37] God chose their King
[31:41] but how can we find the center
[32:15] according to
[32:18] the heart of man
[32:20] the way that they chose him
[32:23] not the way that God wanted it
[32:26] hold up no
[32:28] cuando
[32:30] cuando
[32:32] Saul is so
[32:40] he told him
[32:47] he told them various things that were
[32:49] going to go on on his way home
[32:51] and one of the things that he told him
[32:54] was that when he was
[32:57] that he would wait seven days
[33:04] there he confirms
[33:07] that God changes so they say it says
[33:12] it
[33:14] is
[33:39] no
[33:41] no this is
[33:42] and it was so that when he had turned
[33:44] his back to go from Samuel God gave him
[33:46] another heart and all those signs came
[33:48] to pass that day
[33:50] so there we can see that God was with
[33:52] David or with Saul
[33:56] now in his first battle
[34:00] it says that he came with the with the
[34:03] donkey socking with the donkey
[34:05] noticias and when they gave him the bad
[34:07] news
[34:09] says that the power of God Came Upon him
[34:12] and
[34:13] so in God
[34:16] is supporting the kingdom of Saul
[34:20] but all
[34:22] right
[34:24] but unfortunately it's talking in weight
[34:30] why because when he was in
[34:33] surrounded by the Philistines
[34:40] and the fear had gone had overcome
[34:46] because the Army was it was uh separate
[34:50] he was
[34:51] it was deserting
[34:54] and seven days had been given already
[34:57] had wasn't arriving yet
[35:00] and so then sometimes
[35:03] why don't we wait on God
[35:06] because we get desperate we get fearful
[35:11] and we can't wait
[35:13] can't wait on what God has for us
[35:18] all the Bible says
[35:21] if you were just waited
[35:26] nueve Samuel 13 9 says
[35:45] and he turned seven days according to
[35:47] the set time that Samuel had appointed
[35:48] but Samuel came now to Gilda and the
[35:50] people were scattered from him and Saul
[35:52] said bring Heather a burnt offering to
[35:54] me in peace offerings and he offer the
[35:56] burnt offering
[35:57] sometimes
[35:59] and Desperation
[36:03] they make us screw up
[36:07] to take wrong decisions
[36:09] not waiting upon the guidance of God but
[36:12] it wasn't that way with David
[36:15] knew had a way
[36:20] peaceably
[36:45] foreign
[36:54] [Music]
[37:43] but the Lord said unto Samuel look not
[37:45] on his countenance or on the height of
[37:47] his stature because I've refused him for
[37:49] the Lord to see it not as man see it for
[37:51] man looketh on the outward appearance
[37:52] for the Lord looked down the heart
[37:57] but the Bible says that Samuel was going
[37:59] to anoint a king
[38:01] the prophet says
[38:04] that when his when his dad is when his
[38:07] father and mother is
[38:10] when when they're when they came
[38:12] and they seen their tallest son
[38:16] they said all the crown would look
[38:18] really
[38:19] and his wife
[38:21] that through the prophet bro
[38:29] sometimes the emotion
[38:31] when you get emotional
[38:36] now waiting upon the will of God and
[38:39] we're seeing it here
[38:41] then because of their emotions
[38:44] they went by their natural way of seeing
[38:47] along with Samuel
[38:49] because God hadn't told him
[38:52] but he just said
[38:56] the Lord says
[39:00] he was afraid to anoint a son of Jesse
[39:03] sometimes youth
[39:13] when the emotion takes you out of the
[39:15] way of God the guys then that's when
[39:17] it's not okay
[39:19] let's place an example
[39:22] sometimes
[39:24] when there's a lot of people from
[39:26] various ages
[39:29] young man begins to talk with the young
[39:31] lady
[39:32] then another one with another and
[39:34] correct
[39:36] I don't think it happens here but I mean
[39:40] sometimes that are already talking with
[39:42] the youth
[39:44] they're encouraging the others
[39:49] look at that brother
[39:51] and they get happy they get excited and
[39:55] they don't wait on God
[39:57] you don't want to wait on God
[40:12] of God
[40:40] how highly God has commended these
[40:43] Saints of the Dark Ages
[40:47] as Lambs led to the slaughter fielmentes
[40:51] lovingly Faithfully
[40:54] that is all they wanted out of life
[40:57] your service to their lord
[41:00] how great was to be the rewards
[41:04] I say that David knew how to wait on God
[41:07] I don't want to mean I don't mean to say
[41:10] that he he just sat on a bench and
[41:11] waited he had already been called
[41:29] he took action
[41:32] but he waited on God
[41:36] with his reflection
[41:38] my brother can get ready
[41:44] it says the most important is for you to
[41:46] recognize God as a as your only King
[41:49] and that you do what he asked of you
[41:54] God will give you in your time all that
[41:57] you need the Elizabeth God bless you
[41:59] [Applause]
[42:00] thank you
[42:04] amen God bless your brothers
[42:11] please open your Bibles to Isaiah
[42:13] chapter 40 verse 31.
[42:24] first of all I want to give thanks to
[42:26] God
[42:28] no for allowing me to be here along with
[42:30] you Brothers
[42:32] I don't deserve to be here
[42:35] in reality we all don't deserve to be
[42:37] yeah
[42:40] but it's by God's grace
[42:42] that we are here amen Brothers I also
[42:47] want to give thanks to my pastor
[42:49] for giving me the trust to be behind
[42:51] this Puppet
[42:55] Man he's over there in Denver at least
[42:57] in Denver
[42:59] let's keep our brother John in prayer
[43:03] amen amen and the word of God says like
[43:06] this
[43:07] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[43:09] renew their strength
[43:14] Isaiah 40 verse 31.
[43:28] they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles
[43:46] and it says like this it is I waited
[43:50] patiently for the Lord
[43:59] [Music]
[44:04] amen Brothers amen Hermanos the title in
[44:07] which me and my brothers is
[44:11] waiting for your day as esperando sudia
[44:15] I believe that I will have my day
[44:17] but I also believe that you will have
[44:20] your day too
[44:22] man we are on the Bible character which
[44:24] is
[44:26] you know which I already I I believe
[44:28] that all of us should already know that
[44:30] story
[44:32] you know from the beginning
[44:35] well I don't want the story of David
[44:39] I wanted to just be a story in the past
[44:42] I wanted to bring it to our time
[44:46] no I believe that we're all not perfect
[44:49] we all have our doubts we'll have our
[44:53] flaws we all have our struggles too
[44:58] and if there's one thing is that we
[45:02] struggle with
[45:03] or we don't like okay there's someone
[45:06] who can identify it is
[45:09] if there's one thing that we don't like
[46:22] you see God can work in us
[46:25] but we have patience
[46:27] because God works
[46:30] when we are waiting
[46:32] no we can learn a lot from King David
[46:36] you see David wasn't a perfect man
[46:42] you see but what stood out of David
[46:45] was that David was a man
[46:49] confirmed to the heart of Christ
[46:53] you see he was a man who was faithful to
[46:57] Christ
[46:57] and he had a patient
[47:00] you see when David was anointed
[47:06] from that day and forward
[47:26] you see David I believe that he begins
[47:29] to start having the right expectations
[47:32] and the correct vision
[47:35] correct because of the presence of God
[47:40] many other times we have goals we have
[47:45] dreams that in reality is in
[47:49] disagreement
[47:50] with our true calling
[47:53] to what God has brought us
[47:56] and for a while Brothers
[47:59] we start working
[48:02] we are working
[48:04] for something that has nothing to do
[48:08] with our true calling
[48:11] level in which we were created
[48:13] you see but when we find that encounter
[48:16] with God
[48:17] when we have that experience
[48:21] we will start to realize
[48:23] that we invested too much time
[48:28] the things that we didn't need to invest
[48:30] in the first place
[48:34] and we start to realize that we invented
[48:38] we invested money
[48:40] we invested strength and efforts
[48:44] and things that are not even close to
[48:46] our purpose
[48:49] we will realize
[48:51] that what God has for us
[48:54] what God has foreign
[49:06] there is no foreign
[49:09] to describe Our Calling foreign
[50:22] thank God getting David ready for
[50:24] something great
[50:27] God Was preparing David
[50:30] to be a great king
[50:32] you see we must understand
[50:35] that's the loneliness
[50:37] and the difficult times
[50:40] that we're going to go through
[50:42] it is just God
[50:45] getting us ready for something
[50:48] and although we might go through trials
[50:52] although we might go through struggles
[50:55] although we might go through the fire
[50:58] although we might go through pain
[51:01] in the midst of that
[51:04] God is preparing us for something
[51:08] the life of young David shall be forever
[51:49] see God wants to use us
[51:52] and you know what he can use it
[51:55] he can use use each and every one of you
[51:59] because he knows what we are capable
[52:03] with him by our side
[52:06] you see God wants to use our gifts
[52:09] because we all have gifts foreign
[53:10] yes
[53:18] amen amen when David was anointed king
[53:22] David didn't become the King right away
[53:26] he had to wait 15 years
[53:29] prior to his anointing the espresso said
[53:32] on here though although the spirit of
[53:34] God came to David okay
[53:37] David didn't go running off saying I am
[53:40] the new king of Israel
[53:43] you see he was anointed
[53:46] however he stood still
[53:50] and waited on the Lord
[53:52] you see David is an example of patience
[53:57] the Holy Spirit was upon David
[54:01] had that power
[54:04] but he waited
[54:06] he stood still said in the same way
[54:10] Brothers
[54:11] we're in so much of a hurry sometimes
[54:14] Brothers
[54:16] when we amen
[54:55] so then God can use our gifts
[55:00] we should stop being the man or woman
[55:05] right that once that you want to be
[55:09] start being the man or woman
[55:13] that God wants us
[55:16] stop being the man or woman
[55:19] that pleases themselves yes
[55:25] that pleases the Lord
[55:28] stop being the
[55:31] Persona that looks for their own
[55:33] pleasure
[55:34] and start seeking
[55:37] what pleases the Lord
[55:40] let's stop walking in our own time
[55:45] and start walking in God's time
[55:49] you see Brothers not only no solamentes
[55:53] are we
[55:55] impatientes when it comes to letting God
[55:57] use us
[56:00] as these instruments
[56:03] but I believe we're also impatient
[56:06] when the bad times come unto us
[56:11] you see then David when he fought
[56:15] Goliath
[56:16] David didn't see David
[56:20] didn't see Goliath's strength
[56:24] because he already knew which God had it
[56:29] you see Brothers
[56:32] it doesn't matter no importa how
[56:35] powerful
[56:36] the depression
[56:38] it doesn't matter
[56:40] how how powerful the addictions might
[56:43] look like the anxiety
[56:46] you know although the pain and the
[56:49] struggles will be in front of us
[56:53] we should know that we have something
[56:56] greater
[56:58] behind us
[57:00] amen Brothers
[57:03] I want to read a quote by Brother
[57:05] Branham
[57:06] and it's called perseverance
[57:10] preached in 1962.
[57:14] and it says like this
[57:16] the trouble of it which with we people
[57:21] we're in too much of a hurry
[57:24] it's just got to be done right now
[57:28] can't come back no more
[57:30] and we when you get that in your mind
[57:34] you're going to lose
[57:37] you're on losing grounds right there
[57:42] nothing to stand on
[57:45] you must be patients
[57:48] they that weigh upon the Lord foreign
[58:03] foreign
[59:03] don't be in a hurry
[59:07] waiting watch your observing listen take
[59:11] the scriptures
[59:16] and if it's not right
[59:18] hold on to it if it's not right tell me
[59:23] so I can get it right
[59:26] amen Brothers there was a difference
[59:28] between David so
[59:33] Hermanos
[1:00:26] God bless you if you just uh opened your
[1:00:30] Bibles
[1:00:33] to first Samuel de Samuel chapter 16.
[1:00:42] um
[1:00:43] how many is happy with the Lord
[1:00:46] hey man he's good amen
[1:00:50] first Samuel 16.
[1:00:52] first one says
[1:00:55] it says and the Lord said unto Samuel
[1:00:59] how long will it thou mourn for Saul
[1:01:01] seeing I have rejected to him from
[1:01:02] reigning over Israel fill thine horn
[1:01:05] with oil and go I will send thee to
[1:01:08] Jesse the bethlehemite for I have
[1:01:10] provided me a king among his sons
[1:01:26] so then Samuel said how can I go if Saul
[1:01:30] hear it he will kill me and the Lord
[1:01:32] said take and heifer with thee and say I
[1:01:34] am come to sacrifice to the Lord
[1:01:37] is
[1:01:47] and then we'll jump to verse 13.
[1:01:52] it says since then Samuel took the Horn
[1:01:54] of oil and anointed him in the midst of
[1:01:57] his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord
[1:01:59] Came Upon David and from that day
[1:02:01] forward so Samuel Rose and went to Rama
[1:02:04] is
[1:02:15] I was looking up the word Rama
[1:02:20] and it means a height
[1:02:24] you know so uh after the spirit of the
[1:02:28] Lord Came Upon David
[1:02:32] he took him to higher places
[1:02:36] amen amen
[1:02:38] you see when God does something uh
[1:02:43] you know he doesn't
[1:02:46] um I believe that he's a God
[1:02:49] that uh doesn't reveal himself to
[1:02:52] everybody
[1:02:54] not everybody not everybody's uh God's
[1:02:57] not going to reveal himself to everybody
[1:03:00] amen amen and when he does certain
[1:03:03] things
[1:03:04] he likes to do them in secret
[1:03:08] amen amen I believe that with all my
[1:03:10] heart
[1:03:12] you know the day that um that Samuel or
[1:03:15] that David was anointed
[1:03:18] uh you know uh the Lord obviously he uh
[1:03:22] he was dealing with Samuel the prophet
[1:03:24] yes
[1:03:27] because that's how God deals with uh
[1:03:29] with the people
[1:03:32] he deals with them through prophets amen
[1:03:37] when God when God wants his secret to be
[1:03:40] revealed
[1:03:42] the Bible says he Reveals His Secret To
[1:03:45] His prophets
[1:03:47] amen so he started dealing with his
[1:03:49] Prophet
[1:03:51] because his Prophet uh was uh was
[1:03:54] fearful
[1:03:56] he was scared of what Saul was going to
[1:03:59] do
[1:04:00] if he found out that Samuel was going
[1:04:03] for another king
[1:04:07] amen amen so he uh he does a secret you
[1:04:12] would say a secret anointing Anton says
[1:04:17] it wasn't publicly
[1:04:20] equal but it was something private
[1:04:23] you know I think we're living in a time
[1:04:26] where everybody wants things to be
[1:04:29] public
[1:04:33] that wants to do things
[1:04:37] he wants to do things in secret
[1:04:40] you see we got it you know this is a
[1:04:42] youth service
[1:04:44] you know and uh
[1:04:46] no look around
[1:04:49] everybody wants you know everybody wants
[1:04:52] to know who they like dogs you want
[1:04:55] everybody to know who you like
[1:04:57] you want everybody know you know that so
[1:05:00] so likes me
[1:05:03] that's not a god
[1:05:32] you see not everybody knows about him
[1:05:35] not everybody has them
[1:05:38] because that's the way God
[1:05:41] that's the way God works
[1:05:44] you see that's why you can't find gold
[1:05:47] absolutely everywhere
[1:05:50] because God love God chooses where he
[1:05:53] puts it says that God chooses where to
[1:05:57] put his Secrets
[1:06:00] God chooses where to put that secret
[1:06:02] anointing
[1:06:05] Buenas
[1:06:13] they're done in secrets
[1:06:15] and secretary amen amen you know they're
[1:06:18] not out there you know or you're putting
[1:06:20] yourself out on social media
[1:06:24] and everybody knows what you're doing
[1:06:27] everybody knows where you're going
[1:06:30] hey you know they just they just show
[1:06:33] you the highlights
[1:06:36] they're not showing you the the bad
[1:06:39] times
[1:06:41] amen amen
[1:06:45] see the difference between Saul and
[1:06:47] David foreign
[1:07:17] [Applause]
[1:07:52] you know what weather
[1:07:55] uh whether the people
[1:07:57] whether the people respond to my
[1:07:59] preaching or not
[1:08:01] I really don't care
[1:08:04] because I care I care what God wants
[1:08:08] look at your skin I care about what's
[1:08:10] pleasing to God I mean
[1:08:13] please water
[1:08:55] tawa
[1:08:57] brother Branham says this is
[1:09:00] he says now I've always tried to when I
[1:09:03] come down here
[1:09:05] but when I'm at home to talk about
[1:09:08] something not just to be talking
[1:09:11] or not something that would please the
[1:09:14] people
[1:09:17] I've tried to speak about something that
[1:09:19] would please God
[1:09:23] and help the people you see
[1:09:27] for help that we could all no matter
[1:09:30] what church you belong to
[1:09:32] import
[1:09:34] denomination
[1:09:36] that you could be helped for a closer
[1:09:40] walk with God
[1:09:45] and that's a reason of being here
[1:09:49] it's a closer walk with God
[1:09:53] you see that's what brother Branham says
[1:09:55] that's okay
[1:09:57] know that he wanted he didn't want to
[1:09:59] please the people
[1:10:02] now you know we don't preach a gospel of
[1:10:05] just uh oh that they're just going to
[1:10:07] tell us what we want to hear
[1:10:10] because that's not going to help us
[1:10:18] and just hear all about the good things
[1:10:21] that that I want to hear about it
[1:10:23] that's not going to make me better
[1:10:26] that's not going to make you better
[1:10:30] that's not the good thing
[1:10:33] we all have flaws here
[1:10:42] amen amen
[1:10:44] foreign
[1:10:48] I want to read another quote
[1:10:50] uh from brother Brandon
[1:10:53] it's in the message here you him
[1:10:56] he says notice the tutor brought the
[1:10:59] message to the father and said
[1:11:02] the child is progressing right or wrong
[1:11:06] then if it came up
[1:11:08] now no matter what the outside people
[1:11:11] had to say about this child
[1:11:16] not disturbance on the farm had to say
[1:11:20] he tried to work every way to please the
[1:11:24] father
[1:11:27] no matter what the world has to say
[1:11:30] about you
[1:11:32] it says work to please God
[1:11:36] do everything you can to build the
[1:11:38] kingdom of God
[1:11:40] you see that's what we got to do
[1:11:44] you see we gotta please
[1:11:48] because everybody's gonna have a day
[1:11:52] you know we're waiting for that day
[1:11:55] but some of us are waiting
[1:11:58] for for a day of healing
[1:12:02] others are waiting
[1:12:04] for a day where they can overcome their
[1:12:08] Temptations

[1:12:13] where they meet their wives
[1:12:17] are meeting their husbands
[1:12:19] so we're all waiting for a day
