[25:49] we'll be reading in Matthew
[25:55] and we'll be in uh
[25:59] chapter 28
[26:07] um
[26:09] believe we're going to do a little bit
[26:11] of reading this morning
[26:13] we greet our brothers
[26:16] they are watching online
[26:20] man sister Church
[26:30] Matthew chapter 28 verse 1.
[26:34] DC and it reads
[26:37] is
[26:47] in the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[26:49] Dawn
[26:51] toward the first day of the week Came
[26:53] Mary Magdalene and the other married to
[26:55] see the Sepulcher is
[27:06] and behold there was a great earthquake
[27:08] for the angel of the Lord descended from
[27:10] heaven and came and rolled back the
[27:12] Stone from the door and sat upon it is
[27:19] countenance was like lightning and his
[27:21] Raymond white as snow
[27:28] and for fear of him the keepers did
[27:31] shake and became as dead men
[27:42] and the angel answered incident to the
[27:44] woman fear naive for I know that you
[27:46] seek Jesus which was crucified
[27:54] he is not here for he has risen as he
[27:58] said come see the place where the Lord
[28:01] lays
[28:03] we'll continue reading more let us bow
[28:06] our heads
[28:18] to receive your word I started to be
[28:22] willing to
[28:23] pay attention
[28:25] for what you have for us
[28:45] it is your word
[28:59] we have titled our message
[29:03] we are God's attributes
[29:06] we are God's attributes
[29:09] could you repeat with me
[29:12] it's not a Sunday school
[29:15] but I want to make sure
[29:18] I want to make sure that you repeat that
[29:23] repeat what I am saying
[29:27] the attributes of God
[30:03] with them
[30:30] doesn't matter how great the storm is
[30:33] just how his disciples
[30:36] Jesus Christ was with them and
[30:40] everything was well
[30:42] sometimes we're found that way for a
[30:45] while
[30:46] Jesus Christ has been with us
[31:03] I'm not gonna calm the storm this time
[31:09] that's how it happened with the
[31:11] disciples
[31:13] three and a half years he spent with
[31:15] them
[31:17] all of a sudden they learned
[31:20] but even Jesus Christ
[31:24] these three and a half years
[31:27] he prepared them for that moment
[31:47] they were still blinded to them
[31:54] had to show his actions
[31:57] so he went to the cross
[32:04] that some disciples
[32:06] nombre you can put my name there you can
[32:11] put your own name there
[32:13] they began to deny him
[32:18] they weren't as close to him
[32:21] they couldn't touch him
[32:24] he couldn't hear his voice anymore
[32:27] they couldn't touch him
[32:30] they didn't feel his presence
[32:33] and they began to to stray away
[32:38] if you see brother
[32:42] angel came to the Sepulcher
[32:48] when this Angel descended
[32:53] were afraid
[32:55] they were afraid and they ran how my
[33:01] father used to say
[33:04] why do I want my legs let's run let's go
[33:11] because they were not prepared
[33:14] they weren't prepared
[33:17] and here
[33:19] what what happened
[33:22] but there was a small group
[33:26] a very small group
[33:32] of so many millions
[33:34] only Jesus Christ
[33:37] came to a very few
[33:40] Anton says
[33:47] before a tough situation the human being
[33:51] normal
[33:52] normally is
[33:55] what's normal
[33:58] it's the reflex of the human being
[34:01] but the angel told the woman tranquilas
[34:05] relax assistant Don't Be Afraid
[34:09] don't be afraid
[34:12] because this is for you
[34:17] entices
[34:31] verse 7 says and go quickly and tell his
[34:34] disciples that he has risen from the
[34:35] dead and behold he goeth before you into
[34:37] Galilee there shall you see him lo I
[34:40] have told you I
[34:48] I know there are discrepancies in the
[34:51] gospels
[34:54] some don't mention exactly how it
[34:57] happened
[34:58] they just give you a little tease
[35:02] some uh change it for you
[35:08] some say one thing happened before the
[35:11] other thing
[35:14] as our brothers told us this morning
[35:19] so the first one he appeared was to Mary
[35:22] Magdalene
[35:34] where it says
[35:37] it's better if we all read it
[35:41] because I may be mistaken
[35:44] you can be mistaken
[35:47] but God's word is not mistaken
[35:54] pulco
[36:04] the first day of the week come with Mary
[36:06] Magdalene Ernie early when it was dark
[36:08] until the circle currency the stone
[36:10] taken away from the Sepulcher again in
[36:13] this scene here
[36:15] I see three believerses
[36:23] verse 2 says then she runeth and coming
[36:25] to Simon Peter and to the other
[36:27] disciples
[36:28] and there was three there remember
[36:33] God needs Witnesses
[36:41] be in every business
[36:44] foreign
[36:56] out of the Sepulcher and we know not
[36:59] where they have laid him
[37:02] foreign
[37:15] did outrun Peter and came first to the
[37:18] sepulch
[37:20] the other one was more excited than
[37:22] Peter
[37:25] since Peter denied the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:29] I see Peter backsliding
[37:35] you know when the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:37] resurrected Plus
[37:41] already one of his disciples
[37:45] had committed suicide
[37:56] Place Judas and Peter parallel person
[38:02] I know brother puts Jesus and Judas
[38:05] parallel
[38:10] but Judas didn't give himself the
[38:13] opportunity
[38:14] I know
[38:16] I want you to understand this
[38:19] I know he was the son of perdition
[38:23] but he didn't give himself the
[38:26] opportunity for God to forgive him
[38:30] you know many times we are about
[38:34] to commit spiritual suicide
[38:38] I can see Peter she is
[38:42] if the Lord Jesus Christ didn't come
[38:45] arise from the sephorus
[38:47] sooner
[38:49] he would end the same as Judas
[38:58] you know I spoke with some brethren you
[39:00] know this is
[39:06] and I would say have you noticed uh
[39:08] there's some brothers that used to come
[39:10] to church and they don't come anymore
[39:15] and sometimes you see them in the
[39:18] grocery store
[39:20] and they're kind of hiding from you
[39:26] it's not that one is living a better
[39:28] life
[39:30] but there's a guilt are you not are you
[39:33] are you
[39:34] there's a burden of Shame
[39:38] and sometimes we cannot remove that from
[39:41] ourselves
[39:42] and that's what Jude is
[39:46] Judas could not take that burden off
[39:50] and didn't give himself the chance
[39:56] and sometimes we don't give the
[39:58] opportunity to him that has fallen
[40:18] we're the ones that went to uh tell him
[40:21] of the situation he was in
[40:23] the members of his church
[40:28] and they accused him of secret sin it is
[40:33] brother Branham says they were mistaken
[40:37] God was testing job
[40:41] amen
[41:02] cuando
[41:08] uh
[41:09] four of John 20.
[41:19] closed line yet when he not in he was
[41:22] the first disciple he got there he
[41:25] looked around
[41:27] didn't say anything and left
[41:31] so Peter coming looked around me can say
[41:34] watch no no
[41:37] both of them didn't see anything
[41:42] Peter looked and left
[41:45] the other disciples returned
[41:58] that other disciple which came first to
[42:01] the Sepulcher and he saw and believed
[42:06] this disciple didn't have to see him
[42:12] all he did was seen and believed
[42:19] and it doesn't say
[42:22] Peter had his doubts
[42:25] that's how we are sometimes
[42:30] because sometimes we prove that there's
[42:32] doubt in us
[42:35] that's why the Lord Jesus Christ came to
[42:37] prove something
[42:40] but sometimes we're proving that we're
[42:42] doubtfulness
[42:50] knew not the scripture that he must Rise
[42:52] Again from the dead
[43:00] without at the Sepulcher weeping and as
[43:04] she wept she stooped down and looked
[43:06] into the circle
[43:10] and see two angels in White City
[43:19] because she was waiting
[43:24] and the promise
[43:31] Los Angeles
[43:38] and see two angels in white sitting the
[43:41] one at the head and the other at the fee
[43:43] where the body of Jesus had Lanes
[43:47] and said unto her woman why weep is thou
[43:50] is
[43:53] she said unto them because they have
[43:56] taken away my Lord and I know not where
[43:58] they have laid him Jesus
[44:01] says Jesus said unto her okay
[44:08] she's supposing him to be the gardener
[44:11] situations
[44:17] thou has borne him since tell me where
[44:21] thou has laid him and I will take him
[44:23] away Jesus
[44:24] said unto her Mary
[44:48] when the Lord Jesus Christ begins to
[44:50] call out in the resurrection
[44:52] he will call them by name
[44:56] says how long will the resurrection I
[45:00] don't know
[45:01] I just know that he's calling
[45:04] and I will rise
[45:07] so we see
[45:26] what had happened really happened
[45:30] Anton says
[45:35] the Lord Jesus Christ found two men
[45:37] walking towards Emmaus
[45:40] Jesus never told him go to Emmaus
[45:43] she just told him stay still
[45:46] stay still
[45:48] oh see God's glory
[45:52] there were two on their way
[45:54] and Jesus found them
[45:57] and open their eyes
[46:01] they had to return
[46:04] Locos
[46:09] sometimes we don't say God and count
[46:12] will take off
[46:14] we see a Revival there
[46:17] and there we're headed
[46:20] when that Revival isn't for us
[46:24] God has everything we need here
[46:33] that was doubting
[46:39] sus Amigos maybe his friends sus
[46:42] Hermanos Brothers
[46:50] he's alive and he said
[46:54] Not until I see the holes in history
[47:03] then I'll believe
[47:09] the Lord Jesus Christ Sir Thomas
[47:15] why are you that way Thomas
[47:17] why are you there
[47:19] why don't you believe your brothers
[47:25] why Thomas
[47:29] I need do I have to come
[47:31] again from the circle
[47:33] and show myself again to you
[47:40] a
[47:41] El Sayo de Pasqua program says in the
[47:44] Easter seal
[47:46] you know
[47:48] paragraph 31.
[47:50] no second English
[47:52] this is
[47:58] our purpose to prove his word the truth
[48:05] there was only one man that could do
[48:07] that yes and that was Jesus
[48:11] and he come and proved that to be the
[48:14] truth
[48:16] is
[48:24] all the superstitions of other religions
[48:28] where gray man has rise
[48:32] man has raised up and said great
[48:35] marvelous things
[48:37] but for everyone in the grave religion
[48:41] Christiana
[48:47] for our Christian religion is the only
[48:50] one who has an empty tomb yes
[48:53] and that proves to me
[48:58] the god of the living
[49:02] is
[49:15] proved through the years
[50:15] why did he return
[50:30] But as God
[50:42] God bless you brother
[50:44] [Applause]
[50:52] let's read in the Book of Job
[50:56] what a tremendous word how many love him
[51:01] so our brothers we wish them a happy
[51:04] Easter
[51:07] [Music]
[51:10] joy to celebrate alongside with them and
[51:13] every one of you our sister Vicky and
[51:16] her family we wish her a happy Easter
[51:19] Job 38
[51:21] the end we know the scripture very well
[51:25] chapters 38 verse 4. this is
[51:32] where was that when I laid the
[51:34] foundations of the earth declare of thou
[51:36] has to understand
[51:42] measures thereof if thou knowest or who
[51:45] has stretched the line upon it
[51:48] says
[51:51] we're upon are the foundations or
[51:53] fasting or who lays the Cornerstone
[51:55] thereof
[51:56] on
[52:01] when the morning star sang together and
[52:04] all the sons of God shouted for Joy
[52:07] now to speak of this Easter
[52:11] I want to return
[52:15] that was in heaven
[52:18] you know there was an Eastern Heaven
[52:23] the Bible says that the lamb was
[52:29] before the first Easter was celebrated
[52:32] it was celebrated in heaven
[52:35] it was a celebration
[52:40] when God wrote the names
[52:54] celebrating
[52:56] what he had done for us
[53:04] because it's good
[53:12] I believe there's people that shout
[53:16] September 16.
[53:19] this is our Victory
[53:23] this is our Victory Day
[53:44] so wake up on an Easter morning
[53:48] and not be able to shout
[53:52] she is risen
[53:55] fear
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:30] [Applause]
[54:36] the first history was celebrated before
[54:38] the foundation of the world
[54:41] there we shouted
[54:44] there we gave our Victory shouts well
[54:48] brother Branham says
[54:51] that God was alone he was Elohim
[54:56] the self-sufficient
[55:00] but inside him there were attributes
[55:04] inside his mind there was iron there was
[55:07] you
[55:09] they were in thoughts like ours
[55:12] there were attributes
[55:15] God doesn't have thoughts like we do
[55:19] in his mind thoughts don't change
[55:28] about to manifest
[55:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:47] but he was in the form of God
[55:51] and in the form of government
[55:56] he manifested angels and he became God
[56:02] now you would think
[56:06] because we're speaking about a vision
[56:08] and you were thinking
[56:10] well that's the maximum
[56:13] that's what the devil desires
[56:18] Satan's greatest Vision
[56:23] was to become God
[56:26] that's what he desires
[56:29] he said that if I succeed to be gone
[56:33] he fought everything
[56:36] lost everything
[56:39] because he wanted to be God
[56:42] nevertheless
[56:44] when God became God
[56:47] when Elohim became God
[56:51] he had not yet displayed all his
[56:54] attributes
[56:55] God became God
[56:59] because before having worshipers
[57:19] and he said how can I become more than
[57:23] God
[57:24] how are we sometimes very short
[57:29] we're very short-minded and say the day
[57:31] that I have all I want
[57:33] God had everything he wanted
[58:35] and simple the message God hiding in
[58:38] simplicity
[58:40] of course
[58:45] I'm gonna skip a little ahead
[58:48] foreign
[58:58] I'm going to read in the message God's
[59:01] provided a way of approach to fellowship
[59:05] and I wonder about that then if we go
[59:08] back to the beginning
[59:10] all things begin in Genesis
[59:15] and in Genesis we find out that God
[59:18] creative man for his fellowships
[59:21] God loves to come down and to fellowship
[59:23] with his people
[59:24] I'm going to skip a little more Dios
[1:00:27] foreign
[1:00:33] see here see this here
[1:00:37] when God was God Los Angeles when he
[1:00:41] formed Angels
[1:00:43] he was barely starting
[1:00:48] so fulfill everything that was inside
[1:00:52] and him was the attribute of a father
[1:00:55] Yes or yes
[1:01:28] he could not display
[1:02:15] and he said so that I can become more
[1:02:18] than God
[1:02:20] this blows my mind
[1:02:23] for me to be greater than a God
[1:02:26] I'm gonna become a man
[1:02:33] so that I can become more
[1:02:51] now God hiding in simplicity
[1:02:55] these elements NL uh
[1:02:59] um
[1:03:02] at that time Jesus answered and said
[1:03:06] I think Theo father Lord of Heaven on
[1:03:09] Earth
[1:03:13] these things from the wise
[1:03:19] even so Father for they seemed good and
[1:03:21] I saw it these are these are basically
[1:03:23] uh
[1:03:26] you know God is so great
[1:03:29] he hides himself in Simplicity
[1:03:34] and then he reveals himself in the same
[1:03:37] thing he hides
[1:03:38] God is so great
[1:03:40] he can make himself simple yes
[1:03:45] that's what makes him great
[1:03:52] to God
[1:04:07] it was the most wisest plan
[1:04:13] that anyone could have thought of
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:18] that
[1:04:19] they have not even

[1:10:17] Resurrection the resurrection is
[1:10:22] the attribute of God manifested
[1:10:27] when the attribute of God was manifested

[1:10:38] that he is a savior
[1:11:05] and shined on the seeds underwater
[1:11:12] all they needed was the Rays of the sun
[1:11:15] to shine all right
[1:11:17] and that's what Jesus Christ did
[1:11:20] when he resurrected
