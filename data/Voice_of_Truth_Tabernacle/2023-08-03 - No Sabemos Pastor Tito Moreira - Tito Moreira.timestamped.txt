[21:18] Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou
[21:20] has a name that thou livest and are dead
[21:31] we watch phone strengthen the things
[21:34] which remain that are ready to die for I
[21:36] have not found that works perfect before
[21:38] God
[21:39] let us pray
[21:45] once again we enter in this church age
[21:47] of
[21:48] sardisan we ask for your guidance
[21:53] yes you speak to us
[21:57] thank you for allowing us to be gathered
[21:59] with my brothers
[22:01] everything you do in our lives
[22:27] Lord Jesus Christ
[22:32] amen
[22:36] we're speaking on the Sardis Church age
[22:44] we are finished going through the
[22:46] different verses
[22:48] of the Sardis Church
[22:51] now we're only giving a summary
[22:54] if you remember
[22:56] Iglesia every church
[22:59] had a messenger
[23:04] and there was something wrong they were
[23:07] doing
[23:08] something good they were doing
[23:11] and they had a reward yes
[23:17] these four things
[23:21] today we'll find out what they were
[23:23] doing wrong
[23:25] last week we spoke about the Messengers
[23:34] foreign
[24:04] [Music]
[24:40] patience reveals we don't know
[25:32] the older
[25:48] I hear that you
[25:50] have it every everything
[25:53] you understand everything that's
[25:55] happening
[25:57] but I don't blame them
[26:00] in that situation
[26:03] I thought I knew things
[26:20] better than ever
[26:22] but I realize I don't know a lot I don't
[26:26] know
[26:30] one thing we do know is
[26:33] that we love this message
[26:55] he knows
[27:01] then he will help
[27:15] they're great
[27:19] but God fills every one of them
[27:23] um
[27:29] he says I know that works
[27:31] in other words you think you live but
[27:34] are dead
[27:36] another recommendation is
[27:41] in other words pay attention
[27:45] open your eyes
[28:11] many things you have
[28:13] that are
[28:44] we find out there's a gap in our
[28:47] knowledge
[28:51] we find out that we don't really know
[28:53] those things
[29:00] can someone here explain to me how a
[29:02] zipper works
[29:08] but when we ask you explain it
[29:11] you realize well
[29:14] no say I don't know
[29:17] how
[29:18] does it work I don't know amen amen
[29:26] we find out there are so many things
[29:31] we most likely don't know how they work
[29:40] we don't understand what truly makes it
[29:43] work because
[30:43] most no one knows what's behind all that
[30:45] is
[30:51] that there are many things we don't
[30:53] understand
[30:55] many things we don't know
[31:02] I believe this is one of the things
[31:09] it's important
[31:13] to review what you've learned
[31:22] so you can learn more what you think you
[31:25] know
[31:28] many things
[31:43] perfection
[31:49] now many of us
[31:53] ES
[31:56] many times can't even explain
[32:02] why people don't want to be around us
[32:05] sometimes
[32:07] I'm gonna get in here a little porque
[32:11] because I find out
[32:16] before you take a step
[32:19] from patience to Godliness
[32:29] Como
[33:12] let's set them as they can be husbands
[33:16] be the mother of the house
[33:22] it can be any type of leadership Familia
[33:30] speakers
[34:13] foreign
[34:53] [Music]
[35:10] [Music]
[35:29] when you are
[35:38] that's what we're doing
[35:43] he wants to bring us once again
[35:55] we're not better than the rest is
[36:09] areas
[36:20] your
[36:31] loss
[36:32] or devaluing you
[36:36] is implemented
[36:38] that person does not want to be around
[36:41] them or following them are you with me
[36:48] at One Superior they act Superior
[36:52] personas that type of people
[37:00] they simply think they know more que
[37:03] valenas they're worth more
[37:06] than
[37:07] they can more than everyone else
[37:15] I believe that's why God humbles us
[37:19] puts us at a stop
[37:32] now I will stop you a little bit
[37:37] before everything
[37:45] for taking it
[37:48] we used to understand
[37:50] that you don't know
[37:53] it's not by God's grace
[38:06] and normally he refuses
[38:15] but someone that knows
[38:25] they think they're better
[38:27] that's why God stops
[38:30] it stops the sardisian church
[38:39] it turns us to the beginning
[38:47] I'm not better than my brother my sister
[38:50] I am not better than my brothers
[38:53] if you think you are better
[38:56] you will have very little patience for
[38:59] them
[39:00] amen amen
[39:04] normalmente normally
[39:08] when someone thinks they know Allah
[39:13] is critical
[39:17] Norm normally it's more crucial or he's
[39:20] more critical or tough with everyone
[39:22] else yes
[39:25] and they are softer with themselves
[39:29] many times we judge people
[39:33] by their actions
[39:36] and we judge ourselves
[39:39] by our intentions
[39:56] us to be tougher with the rest
[40:00] and easier with ourselves
[40:13] we want to have all the patients of the
[40:15] world
[40:20] because what I intended to do is
[40:29] we only want to see what they do what
[40:33] they didn't do is
[40:34] with me brethren
[40:39] a person that thinks they know a lot
[40:56] a person that thinks that they know a
[40:59] lot
[41:00] won't hear the rest are with me
[41:08] God says to the Sardis Church
[41:18] hear what the spirit says unto the
[41:20] church
[41:21] we all have a literal here
[41:28] very few have a spiritual years
[41:34] truly hear the rest
[41:41] when you say
[41:58] [Music]
[42:33] but truly they don't want the pastor's
[42:35] opinion
[43:05] I know better
[43:37] they say that we only hear or listen to
[43:40] 50 of that that comes into our brain
[43:46] of that 50 that comes into our mind our
[43:49] conscience
[43:51] we only understand 50 of that
[43:57] means only 25 of everything we heard
[44:09] we don't understand them
[44:38] Amen to that
[44:55] they always only remember the jokes you
[44:57] said
[44:58] or they're good stories
[45:02] I'm just kidding brother
[45:07] now look
[45:11] someone that will hear someone else
[45:14] will learn a lot
[45:17] somos
[45:23] many times it's not lack of intelligence
[45:27] it's not that you're not smart
[45:30] many times they say you don't know how
[45:33] to listen
[45:35] so many problems we go through
[45:39] it's only because we don't hear well
[45:46] muchos de los problemas many of the
[45:49] problems
[45:51] it's because we don't hear what we're
[45:54] being told
[45:55] and if we do here
[45:57] we don't accept it and if we accept it
[46:02] we don't do it
[46:09] very a few people that understand
[46:11] something and do it
[46:15] but listen
[46:22] if you stop for a moment
[46:28] we need to learn to stop you see it and
[46:32] say
[46:33] maybe I can learn something
[46:44] if you really truly listen to your
[46:47] brother
[46:49] you will notice
[46:52] that you understand them better
[46:56] and if you succeed to understand your
[46:59] brother more
[47:00] you will be more patient with them
[47:05] if there's a reason why we don't have
[47:07] patience
[47:08] is because we don't understand them
[47:11] someone say Amen
[47:15] the reason we're not patients
[47:19] the reason I'm not patients
[47:28] it's because sometimes I don't
[47:30] understand anything
[47:44] their way
[47:47] I have very little patience
[47:51] okay
[47:53] but when you can understand someone you
[47:57] say wow I never knew that I didn't
[48:02] understand that
[48:03] so I didn't know that
[48:08] the reason you have yourself so much
[48:10] patience
[48:12] because you know things others don't
[48:14] usted
[48:32] the reason why we're not patient with
[48:34] others is
[48:36] because we don't understand them
[48:41] because they're not like we are foreign
[48:43] things
[49:03] it's hearing each other
[49:09] are you with me
[49:11] hearing
[49:14] this is
[49:15] to say I'm gonna stop here
[49:18] I'm gonna sit down
[49:21] I'm Gonna Be watchful I'm gonna learn
[49:26] something about my brother
[49:30] why is he struggling so much
[49:34] why does it seem he's in the same
[49:36] picture every year
[49:39] I'm gonna hear him out
[49:43] I'll try to understand him
[49:46] but
[49:47] we won't hear Gucci Mane listen
[49:51] we will never listen
[49:55] truly listen not just here
[50:00] truly listen
[50:04] if we think that we already know
[50:09] if I think I already know how much I
[50:12] already know my sister
[50:14] oh this brother is
[50:19] [Music]
[50:26] and I don't take the time to say brother
[50:28] sister
[50:30] what is happening
[50:32] what's going on in your life
[50:44] as long as you think you know
[50:48] you won't listen your ears
[51:03] takes takes us down from the horse
[51:08] he blinds our eyes
[51:12] we can learn wow
[51:34] I need to learn
[51:45] we need a beginner's mind
[51:51] that's what God is trying to do through
[51:54] patience
[51:58] I'm not sure how many guys
[52:03] but sometimes
[52:10] put us in a problem
[52:14] so our ears can be opened
[52:17] and now we say well Lord teach me
[52:21] something
[52:22] yes I thought that I knew okay
[52:26] what I knew I didn't know
[52:30] show me teach me
[52:33] show me what I'm doing
[52:35] what's going on in my life
[52:49] if you don't become as children no
[52:52] foreign
[53:47] know everything
[54:14] [Applause]
[54:38] your wisdom amen
[54:42] man
[54:46] is
[54:48] to learn to listen more than speaking
[54:53] we need to learn to listen
[55:02] truly listen
[55:15] we are not listening
[55:19] have you um
[55:22] how many times
[55:26] because we're thinking about everything
[55:28] we need to do
[55:35] so we learned to listen
[55:41] we must learn to listen what we speak
[55:45] someone that speaks more than what they
[55:47] listen
[55:48] it's because they think they know more
[55:53] she doesn't see you as simple as that
[55:57] is
[56:00] someone that speaks more than what they
[56:03] listen
[56:04] it's because they think they know more
[56:10] me
[56:16] call me
[56:22] help me hear that smooth voice of yours
[56:25] are you that man
[56:26] I know they see Tanto help me not say so
[56:29] much
[56:32] I think we would get rid of so many
[56:34] problems
[56:36] if we didn't speak so much
[56:39] and we only heard earlier
[56:43] speak when we need to speak
[56:46] but listen well
[56:55] foreign
[57:02] [Music]
[58:16] don't make me post
[58:19] foreign
[59:57] of God
[1:00:12] what God has said
[1:00:33] and I was with you in weakness and in
[1:00:36] fear and in much trembling oh brother
[1:00:41] do you realize that's where God
[1:00:45] that's where God can help us
[1:01:09] not in our own knowledge
[1:01:14] I don't know anything
[1:01:23] many of us don't even have time to pray
[1:01:54] then wait
[1:02:16] it's hard to wait foreign
[1:02:32] amen
[1:03:40] waiting on God
[1:04:09] we're such in a rush
[1:04:14] that's why God can't reveal more
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:18] we can't stay still
[1:04:25] we're in the age of entertainment
[1:04:30] when it's something entertaining us
[1:04:33] every moment
[1:04:38] if we knew that that was what's hurting
[1:04:42] us so much
[1:04:46] sometimes we're like my children
[1:04:48] I'm bored they say no say I don't know
[1:04:52] what else to do
[1:04:56] just because they're not on tablets
[1:05:00] there's so much to do I tell them
[1:05:03] go sweep
[1:05:06] go learn something
[1:05:08] well that's how we are sometimes
[1:05:12] we can't stay
[1:05:14] it's hard to stay still
[1:05:18] but it's in Stillness
[1:05:21] where God can reveal
[1:05:24] where you can hear God's words
[1:05:29] when you make time
[1:05:33] God makes time for you
[1:05:42] Be watchful says God yeah
[1:05:48] and strengthen the things which remain
[1:05:50] that are ready to die
[1:05:54] for I have not found thy works perfect
[1:05:57] before God
[1:05:59] is
[1:06:01] God is telling them
[1:06:04] stop
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:49] don't do anything else without hearing
[1:06:51] from God stop
[1:06:55] if you learn this
[1:06:58] you will learn
[1:07:04] that patience
[1:07:07] is
[1:07:09] so useful
[1:07:11] so mighty
[1:07:17] so many demons
[1:07:23] that will be defeated
[1:07:26] mucho not because you're able to do so
[1:07:29] much
[1:07:31] but because you know how to wait on God
[1:07:35] problemas
[1:07:38] there's so many problems we have today
[1:07:43] simply because we couldn't wait
[1:07:46] we didn't know how to listen
[1:07:49] we didn't know how to watch
[1:07:55] let's all stand
[1:08:00] everything begins
[1:08:03] with you saying
[1:08:06] no se I don't know
[1:08:10] I don't know
[1:08:12] so many things Lord
[1:08:16] is
[1:08:18] teach me to listen to
[1:08:20] listen to you
[1:08:22] so listen to my brother
[1:08:32] my wife
