[31:55] amen God bless every one of you
[32:01] it's a privilege to be
[32:03] here and a great
[32:08] responsibility I'd like if you could
[32:10] please open up your
[32:12] scriptures to Genesis
[32:18] 241 we're speaking on a love
[32:22] relationship and as a subtitle
[32:28] I'm going to put I'm a part of him I'm
[32:30] part of
[32:32] him here in Genesis
[32:36] 24 we find a very beautiful
[32:42] picture we see an old
[32:48] man giving uh or giving we see an owner
[32:53] giving a a very harsh task to his uh
[32:56] servant
[33:01] Genesis 241 says like
[33:08] this and Abraham was old and well
[33:10] stricken in age and the Lord had blessed
[33:12] Abraham in all
[33:24] things and Abraham said unto his eldest
[33:26] servant of his house that ruled over all
[33:28] that he had put I pray thee thy hand
[33:30] under my
[33:40] thigh and I will make the swear by the
[33:43] Lord the god of Heaven and the god of
[33:44] the earth that thou shalt not take a
[33:46] wife un my son or the daughters of the
[33:47] Canaanites among whom I dwell
[33:59] but thou shall go into my country and to
[34:00] my country and take a wife into to my
[34:02] son
[34:14] Isaac and the servant said unto him per
[34:17] Adventure the woman will not be willing
[34:18] to follow me unto this land must I needs
[34:21] bring thy son unto the land from which
[34:22] thou
[34:26] camest
[34:28] Abraham and Abraham said unto him beware
[34:30] that thou that thou though bring not my
[34:34] son thither
[34:49] again the Lord God Of Heaven which took
[34:52] me from my father's house and from the
[34:53] land of my Kindred and which spake unto
[34:55] me and that swear unto me saying unto
[34:57] seed while I give this land he shall
[34:59] send his Angel before thee and thou
[35:01] shalt take a wife unto my son from
[35:12] then and if the woman will not be
[35:15] willing to follow thee then Thou shalt
[35:16] be clear from this my oath only bring
[35:19] not my son there there again
[35:26] the and the servant put his hand under
[35:28] the thigh of Abraham his master and
[35:30] swear to him concerning this
[35:33] matter if we can take another
[35:37] scripture Revelations
[35:43] 197 we find here in this
[35:48] picture a great responsibility given to
[35:50] this
[35:52] serpent now the servant wasn't just any
[35:55] servant
[35:59] this servant was the eldest of all the
[36:07] serpants and he was the one that was in
[36:10] control of all of Abraham's
[36:13] inheritance he was his
[36:18] Steward Revelations 197 says
[36:29] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[36:31] honor to him for the marriage of the
[36:32] Lamb is come and his wife had made
[36:34] herself
[36:37] ready you can have your
[36:41] seats may the Lord have the blessing to
[36:43] his
[36:46] word the word to arrange
[36:52] says is to prepare to prevent to dispose
[37:03] another meaning of arrange in the
[37:05] dictionary is to dress with care to
[37:09] Adorn
[37:13] um I chose to take this
[37:20] scene following what our pastor brought
[37:24] previous a virtuous woman who will find
[37:31] and he
[37:32] commented I
[37:36] believe that they were all the
[37:39] characteristics that God was looking in
[37:42] a
[37:44] bride for this last
[37:46] day in other
[37:49] words that
[37:52] scripture perfectly
[37:55] describes the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[37:57] Christ
[37:59] for this last
[38:04] day here
[38:08] Eleazar looking for a
[38:12] bride for his master's
[38:18] son brother brandham says that Eleazar
[38:20] was beginning to
[38:25] sweat this was not any ordinary
[38:38] task of all the things that Abraham had
[38:40] put under eleazar's
[38:44] care this was the most
[38:48] difficult because he
[38:54] knew that he couldn't fail his master
[39:00] but he came out with this with this
[39:11] task and I liked it because one of the
[39:13] things we find in the
[39:16] scripture brother brandham also
[39:18] expresses
[39:21] it is that here goes his
[39:24] messenger with the message
[39:27] of looking for that damor that young
[39:31] lady and to still wait for that young
[39:37] lady to First accept to have a talk with
[39:42] him that she could be still
[39:47] enough so that she could hear the
[39:49] message that he
[39:53] brought and another important thing
[40:00] is that she beli the message this
[40:01] messenger
[40:06] brings and the most difficult
[40:11] thing because if we look at a a couple
[40:16] nowadays we realize that the first thing
[40:18] is
[40:22] attraction but in this case the
[40:24] situation wasn't so
[40:27] he went to go speak to her of
[40:31] him look I'm going to tell you a
[40:34] story my dad
[40:40] says that he was in the apostolic
[40:46] church and he was looking for a young
[40:50] lady and one of his friends came close
[40:52] to
[40:54] him and began to describe to him this
[40:56] young lady
[40:59] and he told her how Christian she
[41:02] was my dad says and I take him by his
[41:07] word that he fell in love with my
[41:10] mother prior to meeting what a beautiful
[41:14] picture beauti picture this shows
[41:19] me how it was with
[41:22] Rebecca is that she just
[41:25] heard and he or he heard and he loved
[41:29] her and in the same
[41:32] way
[41:34] now brother brandham
[41:36] says in the
[41:39] message the evening
[41:42] messenger he says
[41:45] this in paragraph
[41:52] 243 God has always considered the
[41:55] character not the members
[41:58] and we do the things the opposite way we
[42:01] count
[42:02] members good
[42:03] clothing nice paying
[42:07] people in instead of
[42:12] character was beginning to break a sweat
[42:14] a
[42:16] lot until he found character that is the
[42:20] way it
[42:22] is who would he go to
[42:25] counsel and he went to go trust in
[42:28] God character for
[42:31] what character for Isaac the
[42:35] Bride of which the the church is a type
[42:38] you know
[42:40] it that was the natural Seed of
[42:44] Abraham this is the real seed of abrah
[42:49] now now if elz are the messenger looking
[42:51] for a
[42:53] bride and trying to find character
[42:57] if that man has
[42:59] come a messenger in the last
[43:03] days trying to find the bride for
[43:07] Christ he won't look for a membership to
[43:09] a
[43:12] denomination but he'll look for a
[43:13] character that's
[43:15] willing
[43:19] listen first good
[43:24] character then to prepare her to find
[43:26] herself with Isaac
[43:29] after he found
[43:31] character if you read all of the of
[43:34] chapter 24 of
[43:37] Genesis then it
[43:42] was then it was to get her to stay still
[43:46] along to hear his message about
[43:53] Isaac here we first find elaser looking
[43:56] for character
[43:58] and he's prayed to the
[44:00] Lord Lord the young
[44:03] lady that she do this that she do this
[44:06] and this and
[44:10] this the sign that she's going to be
[44:12] that young lady for your
[44:15] son so she went he went near that
[44:19] well there was
[44:21] Rebeca in the evening time
[44:25] [Music]
[44:28] but looking for a bride in the
[44:31] evening and he found
[44:33] her and he found that her that
[44:37] she she didn't think of herself and
[44:40] say what are you asking of
[44:44] me that I give you
[44:47] water woman you are a man take it out
[44:50] for
[44:51] yourself right but no she said yes my
[44:56] Lord
[44:58] I will give you
[44:59] water and all of your camels as
[45:04] well here we found our pastor telling
[45:07] us he says go back to the message and go
[45:13] back it's the Holy Spirit through the
[45:17] angel she didn't have
[45:20] time to begin to ask
[45:23] herself why is he asking me these things
[45:28] why is he asking me not to cut my
[45:32] hair why is he asking me not to be like
[45:34] the
[45:35] woman she didn't have
[45:38] time the message and she took
[45:43] action he didn't have to tell her what
[45:45] to
[45:47] do it was already
[45:50] in the character of serving or the
[45:53] characteristic of serving what a
[45:55] beautiful picture brother
[45:58] today we live in a
[46:01] society that
[46:02] says if you give me I'll give
[46:05] you if you walk I'll walk as
[46:08] well that's the way it is
[46:10] now and each time it gets
[46:16] worse that messenger the last
[46:19] days the evening
[46:22] light will first find the
[46:25] church where they'll believe the m
[46:27] message and look for
[46:30] it can you understand what I'm telling
[46:33] you
[46:35] look if you go to this
[46:37] message the evening time
[46:42] messenger is preaching to us in January

[46:46] 63 and he's telling the
[46:49] church this

[58:35] him the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[58:38] [Music]
[58:43] Christ and if you can take me or follow
[58:45] me quickly we give thanks to God for the
[58:46] opportunity gives us Genesis
[58:49] 2:22 we're going to read it
[58:52] quickly Genesis 2:22
[59:09] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[59:11] from the man made he a woman and brought
[59:13] her unto the
[59:20] man and Adam said this is now bone of my
[59:23] bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[59:29] she shall be called woman because she
[59:30] was taken out of
[59:32] man now we see
[59:35] here that God was looking for a
[59:40] bride now this bride must be a part of
[59:44] him so as I was telling you the
[59:47] messenger he only brought the
[59:49] message this
[59:52] bride fall in love with his Lord with
[59:56] that should be near to
[59:58] him I remember when I fell in love with
[1:00:00] my
[1:00:01] wife I just wanted to be near to
[1:00:04] her I wanted to be near
[1:00:07] her almost nothing separated me from
[1:00:12] her the bride wants to be close to her
[1:00:15] group amen
[1:00:17] amen and I ask
[1:00:22] myself what makes a bride get away from
[1:00:25] her Lord
[1:00:28] what makes a bride get
[1:00:30] away because even the Bible
[1:00:34] says Draw N to me and I'll Draw N unto
[1:00:39] you referring to that scripture brother
[1:00:42] R
[1:00:44] says that this this
[1:00:47] bride the way in which he draws close to
[1:00:52] him he's always she's always thinking of
[1:00:54] him
[1:00:57] she's always conversating or talking
[1:01:00] with she's always in her news in her in
[1:01:06] her she doesn't have time for anything
[1:01:11] else time for the news of the
[1:01:14] world doesn't have time for social
[1:01:18] media too much time for social
[1:01:21] media and more us that we're younger
[1:01:24] than you
[1:01:27] much time we have so much
[1:01:31] time that at any hour we could be on
[1:01:34] social media at work in the car
[1:01:41] driving we can be on social media but
[1:01:44] this
[1:01:46] bride always thinking of
[1:01:49] him now when we speak of a bride let me
[1:01:52] tell you
[1:01:56] that the devil is also preparing a
[1:02:01] bride says in the message the God of
[1:02:03] this evil
[1:02:05] age and
[1:02:09] Satan he will soon take an intellectual
[1:02:13] bride what is brother Bram trying to
[1:02:15] tell me
[1:02:18] here Satan is trying to bring or take an
[1:02:21] intellectual bride
[1:02:28] only has her thoughts in her head and
[1:02:29] she leaves them
[1:02:33] there will exalt this this great
[1:02:37] one Speaking of
[1:02:40] Satan who is the
[1:02:44] Antichrist the hierarchies will place
[1:02:47] him on a
[1:02:50] throne and the whole world will Marvel
[1:02:53] at
[1:02:53] it what I see there
[1:02:57] I've always asked
[1:02:59] myself
[1:03:01] why if I made a promise
[1:03:03] to if I would make a promise to
[1:03:06] go I'm going to surrender completely to
[1:03:10] you this year is my
[1:03:13] year I'm GNA keep from doing
[1:03:16] this stop doing this other
[1:03:19] thing and for years and
[1:03:22] years we spoke with brother Ardo in the
[1:03:24] morning
[1:03:26] just losing
[1:03:27] time wasting time
[1:03:33] Brothers the Bri should be in a high
[1:03:37] place we should be in a high
[1:03:40] place I should be in a higher
[1:03:44] place but we've lost
[1:03:46] time why have we wasted
[1:03:49] time intellect because we want to do
[1:03:51] everything intellectually
[1:03:56] we only
[1:03:58] promise but we don't take any action
[1:04:00] towards no
[1:04:02] action the Bride of
[1:04:05] Satan she looks beautiful she looks
[1:04:09] precious but she takes no
[1:04:13] action action getting closer to
[1:04:19] God and then brother Brom
[1:04:22] says then Christ will come
[1:04:27] two can't exist at the same
[1:04:29] time you can't serve one serve the other
[1:04:33] as
[1:04:35] well make a
[1:04:38] decision sooner or later brother in your
[1:04:42] life you will have to make a
[1:04:45] decision maybe you say well I don't do
[1:04:47] anything

[1:04:52] my position and everything's fine
[1:04:58] that's how you were in heaven as
[1:04:59] well in your
[1:05:02] position and
[1:05:04] glorious until there was found or S was
[1:05:07] like that glorious and in his Splendor
[1:05:09] until
[1:05:11] there sooner or later there will be
[1:05:13] found fall in
[1:05:15] US must be stripped from
[1:05:20] us I have nothing wrong with me there's
[1:05:22] no fault in
[1:05:24] me my friend
[1:05:26] brother sister since you were born since
[1:05:30] you were born this this
[1:05:35] um first John
[1:05:38] says first
[1:05:46] john6 if we say that we have fellowship
[1:05:49] with him and walk in darkness we
[1:05:51] lie and do not the truth
[1:05:59] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:06:00] the light we have fellowship with one
[1:06:06] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:08] his son cleanseth us from all
[1:06:10] Sin from some sins
[1:06:13] brother or from all sins brothers from
[1:06:16] all
[1:06:18] sins did read it right from
[1:06:21] all if we say that we have no sin
[1:06:26] deceive
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:28] ourselves don't deceive
[1:06:33] yourself and the truth is not in
[1:06:37] us we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:06:42] and
[1:06:43] just to forgive us our
[1:06:47] sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:06:50] unrighteous if we say that we have not
[1:06:52] sinned
[1:06:55] him a
[1:06:57] liar his word is not in
[1:07:01] US brother BR continued
[1:07:05] saying two cannot exist both of them
[1:07:08] cannot exist at the same
[1:07:09] time and his kingdom will be taken and
[1:07:13] he will be
[1:07:15] destroyed and Christ the word of God of
[1:07:20] which the woman is a part of the man's
[1:07:24] body they are are not one they're two
[1:07:27] they are
[1:07:30] one and the bride the the church the
[1:07:33] church word the word
[1:07:37] church the people called from here and
[1:07:40] there from
[1:07:41] all caused by his
[1:07:45] name will be brought together in in the
[1:07:48] body of
[1:07:51] Christ and the king of the an will be
[1:07:53] taken and destroyed
[1:07:55] and Christ will take the throne he's
[1:07:59] speaking of the God of this evil age
[1:08:01] okay
[1:08:05] amen and he will sit upon the throne of
[1:08:07] his father
[1:08:09] David and he will re upon the Earth for
[1:08:11] a thousand
[1:08:14] years then he will present the church to
[1:08:18] God without blemish or
[1:08:23] wrinkle now he begins to describe the B
[1:08:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ and he begins
[1:08:28] to
[1:08:29] say why the long
[1:08:35] hair this is why the long
[1:08:38] hair why the long
[1:08:42] hair because she is a part of
[1:08:45] him because you are part of
[1:08:47] him now
[1:08:50] notice his long
[1:08:54] hair there's a Nazarite vow to the
[1:08:59] word I'll describe the bride of Christ
[1:09:10] now says I'll describe the bride of
[1:09:12] Christ
[1:09:17] now we' described the
[1:09:20] anti where the Bride of the
[1:09:24] anti so religious and
[1:09:28] intellectual now the humble bride of
[1:09:32] Christ simply believes the
[1:09:35] word she believes the entire
[1:09:39] word whoever she might be there are
[1:09:43] individuals is us you it's me say it's
[1:09:49] me
[1:09:56] I imagine there's many of them sitting
[1:09:57] here
[1:09:58] present many are
[1:10:00] hearing there through the
[1:10:04] internet and I hope that I myself
[1:10:07] brother that every one of
[1:10:09] you a part of that
[1:10:11] bride I hope that many and
[1:10:18] hopefully and all that are ordained to
[1:10:20] be that will
[1:10:21] be because it is their nature
[1:10:28] they see that the word can only
[1:10:29] recognize the
[1:10:33] word denomination or
[1:10:36] perversion it knows the
[1:10:38] difference it is the bribe you
[1:10:42] see it can't recognize
[1:10:46] anything a grain of wheat can be nothing
[1:10:48] more than a grain of
[1:10:50] wheat he will continue to be a grain of
[1:10:53] wheat and then he will keep being a
[1:11:02] and a weed can never be a
[1:11:06] weat however it's it's it's still
[1:11:08] watered by the same
[1:11:11] anointing it's still it's not a
[1:11:14] weat as I said it the other
[1:11:17] day speaking of the of the tree with the
[1:11:20] different branches
[1:11:22] in when I see that brother bram's here
[1:11:24] explaining
[1:11:27] the story of the prodal son comes to me
[1:11:29] theal
[1:11:32] son he was a part of his father's
[1:11:36] family one day this
[1:11:40] son he didn't feel a part of that
[1:11:42] family and he said to his father
[1:11:46] father look look at how we are as
[1:11:51] children we claim the benefits that we
[1:11:53] have
[1:11:56] accept the
[1:11:57] responsibilities of being children or
[1:11:59] sons of who we're Sons or children
[1:12:03] of and he says give all that pertains to
[1:12:06] me something belongs to
[1:12:10] belongs belongs to
[1:12:14] me the son said father give me all that
[1:12:16] belongs to me father said you know what
[1:12:18] here it
[1:12:20] is here's what belongs to you and he
[1:12:23] left there in Luke 15 he went
[1:12:27] far where no one could see him no one
[1:12:30] knew him to do his
[1:12:34] things he didn't feel a part of this
[1:12:38] family maybe something happened in his
[1:12:41] life something happened in his
[1:12:47] life someone might have
[1:12:50] discouraged he seen
[1:12:53] something I don't know
[1:12:56] maybe there was a
[1:12:58] disagreement something maybe terrible
[1:13:00] happened in his
[1:13:02] family he left
[1:13:04] very he wasted all that he had he lost
[1:13:07] his time wasted his
[1:13:12] time and being
[1:13:15] there he get a little closer to
[1:13:19] his and that's what God wants of us
[1:13:22] brother to get closer to him
[1:13:28] some of us is hard to get
[1:13:30] close we're further we're the furthest
[1:13:32] from
[1:13:33] him but this this young
[1:13:36] man he began to get closer to
[1:13:40] home he got just close enough to see
[1:13:43] maybe the front
[1:13:49] porch he asked for work at his father's
[1:13:52] estate
[1:13:55] and then they they gave him a a job to
[1:13:57] feed the
[1:13:58] pigs and then he he came to
[1:14:01] himself the situation in which he found
[1:14:06] himself he looked all around him he
[1:14:10] found himself in the field and he said
[1:14:14] oh I think I'm
[1:14:16] bride it seems I'm a Son of
[1:14:20] God many of us have
[1:14:22] been and it's a process
[1:14:27] to become the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:29] Christ but he
[1:14:33] recognized and he
[1:14:36] acted he didn't stay oh I know that I'm
[1:14:39] wrong and I'm very
[1:14:41] wrong I'm very
[1:14:43] wrong and yeah I'm gonna keep doing
[1:14:47] what no but he go he got
[1:14:52] up first he recog
[1:14:56] he was in a miserable
[1:14:59] State and then he remembered that his
[1:15:01] father had an abundance of
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:06] bread how did he when did he recognize
[1:15:08] that when he there in the
[1:15:11] F he recognized who he was and then he
[1:15:14] began to cleanse himself he began to
[1:15:17] cleans all of that mud
[1:15:25] satisfy him that
[1:15:28] did because the food that he
[1:15:32] needed was a higher
[1:15:36] food this Earthly food it didn't have
[1:15:38] the
[1:15:39] taste he got up and
[1:15:42] said I'm G to go to my father's house
[1:15:46] and he got up and
[1:15:47] went and what happened with his father
