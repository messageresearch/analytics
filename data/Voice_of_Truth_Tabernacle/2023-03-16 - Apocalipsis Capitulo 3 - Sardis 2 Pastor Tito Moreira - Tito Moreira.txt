entering into this artist's age once again um [Music] to give a small tribute to our sister Margarita okay God called her home to be with him yesterday she was with us here first time so we consider a part of this congregation and we are we're happy for the life that she lived and the example she gave is I believe it also goes with what we are speaking about the patience the and then there like well understanding the the stage that we are in desperate to go wake up to the moment that we're living in sometimes we're so occupied in doing things that we don't we don't detain ourselves we don't stop we don't stop to think what we're if we're doing really matters our mind is so occupied doing things that if we don't stop and analyze our lives and we asked and all this is am I truly doing what really matters because if not one day we will realize we might have that it was not worth it I believe it's important to uh stop and open eyes listen he hasn't even listened to what the spirit says for the time that we're living and ask Lord paying attention to what you want me to do Anton says then I I want to pay attention I want to listen to what God is saying and I've got sentenced this this lady and God wanted to take her part of our Lives I want to pay attention I want to stop [Music] I don't want to just let this go by and think oh I have other things to do but be alert to what God is doing and speaking to come forward and speak some words of sister Margarita is and we thank God for her life to meet her afterwards has been here God bless you I said I was not gonna cry but the good thing is I'm here in at home yeah you know me it's very difficult um partir to uh to partner to see someone leave that you love me you know if I believe in God right now it's because I had God in my home I had him in my mouth in my home I would I would speak with him in simplicity is left or she died because of a short time of Separation The God decided to take away my mother 's grandmother with her in one way or another you treated her well we go to the barbershop we'd go together is you would share stories with me I just share this is so you just know the caliber of of women that you were speaking of is this happened in 1997. when my father passed away I remember I don't know a hurricane they were difficult times for for me as a person since my father passed away I remember it was very cloudy it was a hurricane many people passed away and one of the things that impacted me of my my grandmother is this that I will share with you she suffered very much by her husband in many ways she was mistreated yeah her husband had a a lovers in the same around the same place where she lived a little bit higher than that my grandmother or my grandmother would see my my grandfather just go bye she would see him go by with with his lover that's what she was very saying who wouldn't right [Music] but one of the things that impacted when my father passed away I remember we're going up a little higher where my father lived up in the area where we lived Persona and my grandmother and I even most famous [Music] and where the hurricane went through and everything is a lot of water going through the street the water was very strong and I remember as if it was yesterday I was a very young a person was coming toward us and it was the mother of our brother adelpho yeah I remember that she approaches I remember a lot due to that and that lady approached my grandma and my grandmother approached her and I remember my uh my grandmother asked her for forgiveness that has been mistreated is [Music] I want to thank everybody and God is real brothers let's see it through my grandmother I could talk very much and I'd like to through this means just in greetings all the sisters and take them for what they did when my grandmother was here Living God bless you foreign [Music] thanking each and every one of you um thanking our Lord Jesus Christ for giving me the opportunity the great privilege and honor they were doing to be able to be raised in a home of a daughter of God when you are happy with being familiarika raised in a rich family oh he says hi Jose or maybe uh Sons or Daughters of a king I'm happy to have been raised there where a son and daughter of God was I want to thank my lord for that I think the people that a smile a hug words of encouragement for her when she was here with us um to thank you for that um we're very close to her you know yes one of them was our sisters grandmother would be okay they gave her a thanks or a birthday gift she wanted to go to Disneyland my uh my wife she took the time and took her to Disneyland and I want to thank you for what you did for her I'd like to read a scripture are you an apocalypses in the Book of Revelation 21 verse 4. the scripture says like this foreign and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away um my grandmother margarita Corazon she had a great heart she loved us to take care of her children not only did she adopt us but my brothers but her heart was greater than that in one day a little girl I remember a little a little girl a little baby foreign and she loved her it's our uh our sister Rocio she had such a great heart okay foreign I remember we made her at home it was a little like a tit per se Elizabeth I had a had an aluminum roof she asked me to do that and she wanted to sell in in that place to sell eggs in order that she could raise us that's why she didn't prosper in business she was a great woman her last days the ones that were around her they were able to see the angel of the Lord before her and that confirms she was a daughter of God when she was asked she was ready to go with the Lord so it's not a single doubt in her heart she said I'm ready foreign she was a great example for me um as my brother said if we are here today is because one day a woman like her stood up for God and as Paul told Timothy circus as I saw of faith in that woman that was not that was not a fake and and that woman was that type of thing either of faith that was not uh may the Lord bless you [Applause] do we give our uh [Applause] the Bible says we have a great cloud of witnesses that encourages keep going it can be done why could you are going to be able to as well continue fighting the good fight and finish the race almost uh just change it up a little bit we're going to enter into the Sardis Church Revelation 3 1 once again we're in the fifth Church the fifth Church the age of Sardis the time of the Reformation at the time of Martin Luther where the Protestants were born and the seed that was founded by this nation that this nation created that created this that created this nation is and unto the angel of the church and Sardis right these things said he the the hath the seven spirits of God um I want to focus on the seven Messengers in the seven spirits this evening the random tells us seven spirits speak to us of seven men you see them in Revelation 1. there's the seven angels to the seven churches this is very evident that the word they refers to men uh Associated spiritus those seven spirits and Seven Stars I want you to notice this is two attributes but also tells us in the stars the Bible also also mentions them as seven eyes it only mentions two things of them spirits and the Seven Stars but they're also seven eyes and also seven lips it is very evident the word they refers to Men of course there will be anointed for God's Ministries are not in the power of men synonyms it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous Ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men in other words it's only one Holy Ghost but in seven minutes there's seven manifestations they're not seven different spirits but seven different anointed or commissions you can read it again it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous Ministry of the similar spirit in the lives of seven men they say s with whom God identifies himself very closely God identifies himself with them God has identified himself with those seven spirits they are his eyes they are his lamps because the next phrase causes the Seven Stars which are already known to us as the seven Messengers in chapter one that those the Seven Stars are the seven angels so just review that chapter later is the star was meant to reflect light at night for the Sun they all did this through the holy ghosts so we see that the seven spirits actually referred to the one spirit of God working out the will and word of God in different Generations I would like to take the moment to see why God mentions them in this age well he brings This to Memory in this song what does it have to do what's the status yes because we're studying the virtue of patience that God has an anointing for each other in other words God gives each age what they need for that age of Ephesus for the spirit church God knows God knows we'll go through different stages in our lives in the spiritual churches they didn't need a poem in Iranians with each and every one of us needs yes God knows what I need no today is higher things than what even the message back to the original word of God in the time of Luther is if you would have been in the time of Luther you stayed around and you were one of them okay that said so I want to know all the Mysteries I want to know the Book of Revelations but something preached at something higher something something stronger usted you would have put a Luther aside what else a simple message he's the messenger of all this church isn't that what we do many times in a very simple message that wasn't for me yes somebody eat something else the God is not in Rush before I can give you more the seven Messengers they did not give the same thing it doesn't mean it was the same Holy Ghost Santos from Paul to Brothers foreign [Music] Dios Liberty service God anoints the Son of God or the the man of God that is placed under the guidance of God to give the church as they need that's what God is telling to start his church he's telling them I am the eyes and I see what you need and I send the correct what's the correct nutrients in order to give you to in order to get you to the stage you're going through right now we are many times brothers that we want something else we think we need something else I know what you need to jump to another state yeah over there when I'm not even at the first step yet [Music] foreign because if you ignore where you're at least if you don't open your eyes to the place where you are you what you won't know what you what you know you think you know but you're living in another place [Music] that aren't for that time it's not enough for them foreign [Applause] brother Brown Hallelujah foreign know it is God is saying Hombres I have those seven men in my hands Seven Stars it gives you Direction how am I going to do it how am I gonna get there following the star s I'm following my own thoughts my own desires my own preachers so tell me things I want to hear the big churches and then they do uh their studies Suave you like a preacher that speaks softly to give people questionnaires to make the church brighter do you like when they greet you when you go in or else when someone funds the church according to what the people around Jesus Christ [Applause] they would show me a living Christ [Music] o who cares if it's a Luther an that's what I need if God sent me a loose maybe that's what I need it that's what many of us need stop thinking about so much Mysteries thinking about where your life is and realize that you have a lot to go you have no more time and then you better yes because if not you won't arrive over there to the churches out there what does he say God says what you need now today today John 16 12 says John 16 12. I have yet many things to say unto you said the Lord Jesus but you cannot bear them now this is you just had more to give them but it wasn't uh because it wasn't that right time they couldn't they couldn't take them in Mysteries we haven't even arrived to justification many times matured yet then I can give you a little bit more the prophet continues saying the last paragraph this is the same Lord identified himself with men in the Incarnation is again identifying himself with the man by his Spirit within him man speaking of these seven spirits El Senor es the seven spirits filled Spirit-filled Messengers are the Lord they may be repudiated questions lead to human minds they may not even seem to qualify [Music] respective nevertheless they are The Messengers for their age God used in Abraham says use the Moses he murdered that's Jesus Christ he also saw that so God use that location s who cares if Martin Luther baptized in the name of the didn't baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you didn't need that at the moment that's not what the people needed it's not what they needed so as we get upset here at church it's preaching too simple um some get upset because of that and they say oh brother he's angry maybe that's what you need don't complain is errors yes I never told you I was perfect I didn't put myself God placed me here I didn't put you here I didn't put you here I'm not begging you to stay here that God has to the churches more perfect with God amen hallelujah glory to God that's what patience is about the God has me here for a purpose as for me at the moment is to pay attention so what God wants to tell me today no he's going to tell me tomorrow me today the service will be what you make of it yes Brothers sometimes God won't move the mountain [Music] what I'm telling you sometimes the only way it's mine of yours sometimes the only way it's time to shorten our trials as they listen our trials insurance is to lengthen our patients sometimes the only way shorten our trials is to lengthen our patients La Manera sometimes the way to lengthen our trials is to shorten our patients the shorter our patients the longer our trials because God says you're not paying attention you are in a hurry you're ready to go to another state I could take the trailer way because you're not paying attention the musicians can't come forward numbers 21 4 says and they journeyed from Mount hore by the way of the Red Sea to Encompass the land of Adam and the soul of people was much discouraged because of the way yeah and as people speak against God wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness but there is no breadth of this light bread God wanted them to eat light bread and they didn't want it what's behind that voice just shall live by faith [Music] shall live by faith but there was enough power there so anybody that received that message would be in the rapture and go in the rapture how tremendous is our God [Music] if you would please stand [Music] they say he says when they became impatient and they complained about that like this the Bible says the Lord sent them fiery serpents serpientes and most people of Israel died foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] they complained they became impatient and God said you know what is it so you can have something to complain about I'm going to send you some serpents you don't want to give you uh you receive what I want I want to give you um you don't want the man that I sent you yeah I will send you some serpent sip because you want to hear you I don't want what I want you can look I want what he wants the power of the Holy ghosts may be that what he wants from my life stay still yes wait on God [Music] sometimes that's the hardest thing it's classic kid is to stay still when it appears like God's not doing anything it seems like it's the most difficult thing is to wait on him [Music] but believe me you are being changed the Bible says that the patience produces Perfection of our faith [Music] I don't know what stage you're in but one thing I do know is that God is trying to speak to you and tell you something don't think that he stops speaking so then he stops doing but he's trying to do something right where you're at maybe it's not what you want but it's what you need and the best thing we can do something that you want to speak to me let's see tell me Lord oh Lord help our church help me Lord nothing greater than the mess engers [Music] what are we doing I'm hearing what we want to hear [Music] um [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're welcome [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] they decided you're welcome [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Matthews [Music] call Migos [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] if already [Music] [Applause] [Music] gracious [Music] [Applause] oh thanks he called me now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] the service we're going to do another special offering to try and pay off the land is but he who can get more um I know that God's Gonna bless him foreign [Music] [Music] because we've already received something amen in the evening
