[27:22] cuantos
[27:36] [Applause]
[27:39] how many thankful children are here this
[27:41] morning I am thankful with him
[27:47] Jeremiah
[27:50] verse 20.
[27:53] Jeremiah 8 20.
[28:10] I want to speak on restoring a broken
[28:13] bride restaurant
[28:16] restoring a broken bride
[28:19] Jeremiah 8 20. you have a brother
[28:27] the Harvest is past the summer has ended
[28:30] and we are not saved
[28:41] for the hurt of the daughter of my
[28:44] people am I heard I am black
[28:46] astonishment has taken hold on me
[28:49] verse 22.
[28:52] foreign
[29:23] simply reconnect with you
[29:28] and be consecrated once again
[29:31] I believe every Sunday service every
[29:34] service the
[29:39] hello
[31:06] are receiving Restorations
[31:23] a watcher and as a watcher in this place
[31:26] I have to ask myself the question
[31:34] how much restoration
[31:39] has happened in our lives
[31:44] because something is to speak about
[31:46] restoration
[31:50] and something else is to truly receive
[31:53] restoration
[31:56] it's easy to speak on restoration
[31:59] is
[32:02] restoration is very difficult
[32:05] it's a process
[32:07] that's painful
[32:09] it's a
[32:12] processarily you must go through
[32:16] a lot of heartbreak
[32:22] so you can truly become fully restored
[32:28] and that's the place we don't want to go
[32:30] in no queremos
[32:38] sometimes we want God to take us the way
[32:40] we are
[32:42] and that's where the job starts where
[32:46] the work starts but many times
[32:50] for God can begin a restoration
[33:05] he can now restore
[33:09] now God does received
[33:16] but he can't work
[33:20] until we are broken
[33:25] I want to speak on this Pride
[33:28] the Bible speaks
[33:31] the Kingdom
[33:33] of Heaven is
[33:38] foreign
[34:06] [Applause]
[34:38] marriage of the Lamb is come
[34:40] and his wife hath made herself ready
[34:45] and so her was granted that she should
[34:47] be already
[34:53] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[34:55] of Saints
[35:03] and the angel told me blessed write the
[35:05] names of them that are invited to the
[35:06] Lamb's wedding supper
[35:09] and there we see once again
[35:17] that God is comparing this time
[35:23] there's a bridegroom and a ceremony a
[35:27] ceremony in a wedding there's a
[35:29] bridegroom and a bride all right
[35:36] we're speaking on restoring
[35:50] and I John saw the holy city New
[35:52] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[35:54] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[35:56] her husband
[36:00] in English it says a bride adorned for
[36:03] her husband
[36:05] and then verse 9 says
[36:20] and there came unto me one of the Seven
[36:22] Angels which are the seven vows follow
[36:24] the seven last plagues and talk with me
[36:25] saying come hither I will shoot Thee the
[36:28] bride the Lamb's wife
[37:25] but all of this is
[37:35] is already in God's word
[37:39] we are the bride
[37:43] we've made a covenant question
[37:50] he's made us a promise
[38:08] that we were here
[38:27] in First Corinthians 15
[38:30] God Compares or the Bible Compares
[38:35] Jesus Christ Jesus Jesus
[38:39] to Adam
[38:42] it actually says he was the last Adam
[38:46] the second act together
[38:48] that means the last Adam
[38:53] Jesus so if the Bible is comparing Jesus
[38:59] there has to be a similarity
[39:02] between the first Adam and the last time
[39:07] Adam from Genesis
[39:09] and Jesus Christ
[39:13] Matthew John 1 whatever you want to call
[39:16] it
[39:22] [Music]
[39:34] if you read the previous verses you'll
[39:36] find out speaking about Jesus Christ
[39:39] I want you to understand
[39:48] we can see history repeat itself with
[39:51] the last Adam the Bible says
[39:55] from Adam came forth the woman
[39:58] now this is very important
[40:03] Adam's bride came out of himself
[40:06] I want you to notice this is
[40:10] not good for man to be alone
[40:48] the Bible says I shouldn't be alone
[41:08] the word
[41:17] it says it is not good for man to be
[41:19] alone
[42:19] La Costilla and the rib from Adam
[42:29] I don't think it was just any type of
[42:31] I'm gonna take this
[42:33] I think that's why you have to sedate
[42:35] him a little
[42:37] because it would be something painful
[42:41] when Jesus Christ died
[42:43] it wasn't something easy
[42:48] when he was placed on that same bed the
[42:51] Bible says
[42:56] pierced him on the side yes
[43:00] opened his side
[43:03] don't tell me it was something easy
[43:06] he was in pain
[43:12] and they still Pierce him on his side
[43:18] they pierce him on his side
[43:21] water and blood come out
[43:24] foreign
[44:05] from Brokenness
[44:10] Lord Jesus Christ
[44:25] make it seem very easy
[44:28] I ask myself how
[44:32] want to know how much no doleria how
[44:35] much didn't it
[44:37] how much wouldn't that hurt if that
[44:39] happens to us
[44:46] I understand there were many things that
[44:48] are now a day
[44:50] I believe God does everything perfect
[44:55] she had to break off a rib
[44:58] rib
[45:12] hi
[45:16] ferente that's different
[45:21] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ was
[45:24] born had her birth
[45:29] on such a painful day
[45:33] Hermosa it wasn't a wonderful day
[45:37] it was wonderful for a Christian yes
[45:40] wonderful for the children of God yes
[45:44] but Jesus Christ was in pain
[45:48] he was in pain
[45:56] every one of those uh
[46:00] every one of those
[46:03] one of our iniquities
[46:22] comes into life
[46:25] man
[46:26] a new moment in a moment of Brokenness
[46:30] is where the bride was born
[46:36] I should tell us something
[46:42] what hertzgar the most okay what hurts
[46:46] Jesus the most is his bride
[46:56] important this is very important
[47:07] that he could not deceive Adam
[47:11] is
[47:19] because he was married to the image of
[47:22] God
[47:23] pero la mujer but the woman
[47:26] ever if
[47:30] she came a little more different
[48:11] to the woman
[48:39] his bride
[48:47] the serpent was used for this
[48:51] you know if he attacked the woman he
[48:54] knew if he attacked the woman
[48:56] he would attack the man
[49:04] if he attacks the Bride of the Lord
[49:06] Jesus Christ
[49:09] he is attacking God's plan
[49:13] the devil can't go against God
[49:19] simply he can't
[49:22] but the devil does know
[49:25] he can go against Pride
[49:31] he hinders God's plan
[49:36] ovia because the bride
[49:39] is
[49:40] the one on earth now
[49:43] the bridegroom has left
[49:46] and the devil took advantages
[49:59] standing here on Earth
[50:01] the bride
[50:04] she is representing him
[50:08] and the devil knows
[50:11] he attacks the
[50:14] brideos attacks God's plan
[50:24] pride is so important
[50:33] are the same
[50:38] hold on now
[50:43] Adam didn't find his bride
[50:46] the advance his bride came out of France
[50:52] so the woman was Adam
[50:55] um
[51:05] foundation so the rest can take a little
[51:07] meat from here
[51:12] the woman was not found
[51:15] right
[51:18] she was not found foreign
[52:36] he
[52:41] can take the man
[52:51] that's why the bride is an attacked
[52:54] bride
[52:55] La Novia is
[52:57] the Bride is a broken bride Elementary
[53:03] says the body of Jesus Christ is
[53:08] the illness and body that is most in
[53:11] need
[53:12] in other words
[53:16] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:23] and the most in need
[53:33] because sometimes we speak of a higher
[53:35] things
[53:38] speak on the condition we're found in
[53:42] restaurants
[53:57] oh you'll be quiet there
[54:00] but that's the truth is
[54:07] second Corinthians
[54:10] 2 Corinthians 11
[54:13] verse 1.
[54:25] for I am jealous of you you with Godly
[54:28] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[54:30] husband that I might present to you as
[54:31] chess as a chaste virgin to
[54:44] Christo but I Fearless by any means as
[54:46] the serpent beguiled if through his
[54:48] subtlety so your mind should be
[54:50] corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[55:04] for if he that cometh preaches another
[55:06] Jesus whom he whom we have not received
[55:08] or if you receive another Spirit which
[55:10] you have not received for another gospel
[55:11] which you have not received ye might
[55:13] well bear with us
[55:17] the first church
[55:22] the Bride of Jesus Christ was already
[55:24] been deceived
[55:56] all of that
[56:06] you're very mistaken
[56:10] very mistaken
[56:15] now look what happened
[56:19] as the woman Eve
[56:23] is Posada
[56:24] was a bride
[56:30] because marriage has not been consumed
[56:33] yet
[56:38] long enough
[56:43] the serpent entered
[56:47] and the next time we see the woman
[56:50] in the next chapter
[56:53] or a few verses later
[56:57] we see her broken
[57:00] we see Eve broken
[57:07] um
[57:11] she realized she was naked
[57:16] she realized she lost everything
[57:21] and we see Adam
[57:27] having to redeemed his bride
[57:33] he comes
[57:36] and the entire creation fell
[57:43] let's see the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[57:45] Christ for a moment
[57:46] she was born
[57:50] in
[57:54] La Cruz the surgery began at the cross
[57:58] and then life came in here
[58:03] life came in on Pentecost day
[58:07] that's when the life came inside
[58:10] that's when the Holy Spirit descended it
[58:13] is
[58:20] that we're divided broken
[58:24] this is important this is important
[58:28] it's important there to understand
[58:32] how the pride comes
[58:36] it's important to understand our
[58:38] conditions
[58:43] at the first churches was a church full
[58:46] of powers
[58:54] [Music]
[59:19] she was cut off completely
[59:23] pero
[59:34] um
[59:36] but my point don't worry if you don't
[59:39] understand the details
[59:41] my point is that it's a broken bride
[59:45] El Diablo the devil
[59:48] goes against the bride
[59:51] with everything he's got El Diablo
[59:55] the devil goes against us
[1:00:14] and if he can succeed
[1:00:17] to break this price
[1:00:26] is annihilated
[1:00:41] Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:00:44] so broken
[1:00:48] Lord Jesus Christ is broken
[1:00:53] we are a broken body
[1:00:56] says
[1:01:49] and
[1:01:52] the way they were tortured
[1:02:00] here they go Senor to see Jose I say
[1:02:04] Lord your children are so broken
[1:02:09] matrimonious I see the marriages
[1:02:11] the lives
[1:02:15] Lord we're so broken
[1:02:21] the devil has
[1:02:23] has ripped us apart
[1:02:27] the devil has taken advantage
[1:02:31] of the little that we give sometimes
[1:02:37] and the Devil comes in when you give him
[1:02:39] a space
[1:02:42] he does everything he can
[1:02:46] buy everything he can to destroy us
[1:02:53] that's the devil's job
[1:02:59] but God needs a broken bride
[1:03:03] dios
[1:03:05] a broken bride
[1:03:08] is
[1:03:16] a future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:03:18] and Earthly bride
[1:03:21] um
[1:03:23] I'm going to start on the third
