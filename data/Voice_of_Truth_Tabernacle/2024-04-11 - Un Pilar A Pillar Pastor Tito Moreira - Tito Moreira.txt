very amazing let us open our Bibles to the Book of Revelations chapter 3 we greet each one of you expecting that the gra grace of God has been keeping you and helping you and giving you strength in the very difficult time we're living but the Grace has saved us the grace will take us through to the end he will finish the work Revelation 3:10 Phil we're going to continue with the Philadelphia Church because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take th crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth into the churches let us pray Lord Jesus Christ each member that each person that assisted uh we put them in your hands every mind and every heart be in the right place I already hear something from you this most certainly we all need something from you there is no one here that is perfectly right there's something in our soul that is crying out may possibly be that our body may not be but our soul is crying out there's a hunger for you Lord there's a desire for you to help us a little bit more we put ourselves in your hands help us we ask name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may be seated phph trying to get to the end of the Philadelphia Church we've been on Philadelphia for a time now it's a very important a very interesting age and we've been learning on this sixth Church age of the seven that book of Revelations speaks we are on the sixth one Phil Philadelphia and we know and we also are speaking on the sixth virtue the Sixt that second Peter chapter one speaks of six virtue is does anybody remember six virtue godl I go to we forgot we're learning on godliness what does godliness mean Amen to be like God godliness means to be like [Music] God godliness means to be like God so we're getting to the end of what God is telling this church age and he is telling them about the reward the rewards of godliness when you have obtained godliness when you have fought to know him when you have let go of all form of godliness when you have been been real sincere with God and you see him real in your life you get to Godliness there are rewards there are benefits there are things that God gives us there's a reason why God wants us to get to Godliness it's not just to have godliness it's because there's benefits for the child of God and he begins to say in verse 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience in other words because you have kept my name you have kept what I said what I am you grabbed hold of it he says I will also keep thee from the hour of Temptation let me tell you that there are times when you you take care of what God has G given you there are moments where he is the one that is keeping you in the message the unconditional Covenant that God made with the people says someone said brother Bram when you was off those eight months was going through some difficult times some hard times and he was out for eight months he wasn't in in the work that time I almost to break down he's almost collapsed almost died says did you keep no did you keep your religion words did you keep your religion says says no sir my religion kept me in other words My Religion kept me let me tell you we're all going to get to a point in our lives where we've given great effort we have struggled we've done the best we could and even then we will fail many times our efforts our strength won't be able to our strength won't be enough we'll realize that in those moments God says because you give efforts because you gave the best that you could now I will keep you come on Brothers this isn't just anything this isn't just anything brother VI he keeps us when we can't keep him for our strength isn't enough he says because you've done the best you can because you have believed in me because you've continued believing perhaps your strength is little but now I will take care of you now I will keep you when he should have left us when he should let us go he says I will not let you go I will keep you because you've done the best you can how tremendous I begin to think a little bit on Noah how many times he perhaps wanted to give [Applause] UPS perhaps you may said I I I spent a long time building this Ark how many how many days I imagine getting there with his hmer with his saw and the wood and the construction of the Ark maybe he uh he he took a deep breath he said do I want to continue or not 120 years 120 years or not have you ever come to service you're on the bench but it seems like you're there but you're not perhaps you may have wanted to go back home let me tell you but you you you remain there you you you stay there Lord I'm going to do everything possible do the best that I can and when Noah was going through that great storm he was going through the hour of Temptation he may have said the good thing is I didn't give up good thing is I kept going to service one day you will say the good thing is I kept going to service per may be difficult right it may seem that you you don't what are you so worried about but one day you will look back when you see the others the others thrown along the way Great Tribulation comes upon this Earth You will say thank you Lord that you kept me that I continued going to church come on Church stay strong this this evening if you're planning on giving up just just keep going forward one day it will be worth it one day it will be worth it says because I was kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the out Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth God will not ask you to do something that you are unable to do he will take care of that but he will ask of you to do what you [Applause] can you may you may not be able to do anything in that day the day of Great Tribulation the great and terrible day of the Lord you won't be able to do much on that day but now is when you can do something today is when you can do something right now is when you can say Lord help me right now I want to serve you now I want to do what I can right now and when that day arrives that you and I won't be able to do a whole lot you will be able to say Thank You Lord because now you will keep me it's worth it to serve God it's worth it to give it's worth it to read our Bible lamp is a is a Light lamp is is your to my feet that's what keeps us it may seem like nothing is happening say what good does he do to come to service or read but let me tell you a little by little you are building your Ark you are constructing what will take you to heaven little by little you are constructing you are fighting for your salvation amen amen sometimes it seems like we're crawling but at least we're going verse 11 he says behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take that Crown says I come quickly I believe he's coming quicker than we can imagine he's coming quicker than we think do not get relaxed it's the most difficult time but don't relax there's not a whole lot of time left there's not a lot of time left church the more difficult that seems to get that is the evidence that there's not a whole lot of time help me God in these difficult times remember why I'm doing what I'm doing there's not a whole lot of time left grab hold of it grab hold of what you can grab hold of your faith he says behold I come quickly then verse 12 says him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God pillar is in English call them in Spanish call them in Spanish says he that him that overcometh will I make a a pillar brother Bram says in the Philadelphia Church age this pillar a pillar or a foundation foundation in the temple the house or the house of God the Temple of my God or the house of my God it's a pillar the foundation these are those that took the word which they heard in verse eight and went back to the foundation he's speaking on of a pillar of a column know something that that holds up the the the building surely connected to the highest part of the building and the lowest a pillar is connected of the the structure of of the frame it is so essential it is what strengthens the building is what can uphold the weight and it's connected to the foundation and to the whole structure from the top to bottom that is the pillar brother bam says it's a column these are those which took the word and they heard it and and went back to the foundation he says now let's get Ephesians 2:19 over at the church of Ephesus you know you have to go back to Ephesus that was the beginning is that right let's go back to Ephesus where Paul was the church that he established and let's see now where we're at the church of Ephesus let's go back now and see what this Foundation is back there see what Paul said about the foundation back in that first church age there now he's talking to the Ephesians now therefore you are no more strangers or foreigners but fellow citizens with the saint and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Lutheran of or or the Baptist now wait I got mixed up didn't I oh but are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being himself the Chief Cornerstone everything went in at the door Jesus and he that overcometh will I make him a pillar in other words part of the foundation what does a pillar mean means to be a part of the foundation going back to the foundation being connected to the original let me tell you if we need something right now connect to the original I want the modern Doctrine I want the original doctr the original word the original life come on Church Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever I don't want another Jesus Christ want the original Jesus Christ I will make you a pillar you will be a part of the foundation says what will I give him I'll put him in the do in the doctrine of the the apostles and prophets from the beginning and give him the Revelation what the prophets say about him counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father oh church I don't know if you're understanding what the prophet's saying will have the same Revelation that the apostles hadu I don't know if you believe that or not perhaps you don't desire it but who what kept them what made them what they were because they were men that were so filled with the holy spirit because why why were they men filled with the Holy Ghost because they had the right Revelation they understood something of God knew the Lord Jesus Christ face to face they walked with him they were with him they knew his nature the word of God says here if you obtain godl I will connect you you will understand what the apostles understood this isn't just anything this isn't just anything Brothers that's to have the Revelation that the apostles had the ones that laid the foundation the pillars of this gospel you become one with them wow I don't know if this is something big for you or not you are a part of the structure and you understand what they understood it's difficult for example somebody new that comes into this church it's difficult for them to understand what it means to be here today to have this building somebody new arrives and they come and sit down they don't understand the beginnings of a Voice of Truth Tabernacle they they weren't there they weren't there when when God placed on my heart to to initiate or start Voice of Truth Tabernacle move from one place to another to help my father and to start Voice of Truth Tabernacle they don't understand what it was to have services at 3:00 p.m. because that's when they rented the building to us in a small room we couldn't have services in the morning they don't understand but it was when we moved to Colorado to just leave everything forsake everything and start over again they don't understand when we cried out for a new building a place of our own someone that barely arrived they don't understand those pains understand those sufferings those moments until they begin to connect to the church they begin to understand where we come from what we've gone through it hasn't been easy what the apostles went through wasn't easy they gave their life they gave their life they literally gave their life they literally paid sufferings and lashings so you and I could be here today they rejected them they mocked them look at them for a moment look at Paul how many times they tried to kill they put him in jail look at him incarcerated with cold and once they let him go he wouldn't stay still he continued and he looked for another place to go and take the gospel many times we don't understand because we're here comfortable we don't understand where it all began and God says I'll give you understanding I will connect you to the foundation to the beginning of everything you will not understand significance of the moments of success unless you've been a part of the lowest times until you've experimented the low moments you won't understand the the the the high moments the High Times the good times a pillar somebody something that's connected to the low and to to the to the high parts something someone that not not only uh not only understands the moments of success but someone that understands the lowest moments as well when everything we see was not here yet there was a foundation there was something solid something that was founded that's what a pillar grabs hold of of those low moments of the difficult moments you won't understand for example you you'll never understand what it means to uh to see the grace of God in your life unless you connect with that Jesus that was crucified through by which came the grace you have to see the pain that Jesus went through you have to connect yourself with that cross you have to connect with every lash that he received every all the pain he felt when he felt as though every bone was breaking if you don't connect to that you don't understand the grace you don't appreciate Grace that's why Grace becomes a disgrace because people have not understood what theyve received don't understand what Jesus did for us oh Brothers if we need something today connect with what he did for us connect with the cross connect with the great love he had for you and I brother brandom he says in the message the Mighty God unveiled before us he says I was with John the Baptist and before them critics I seen the spirit of God descending I heard the voice of God say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased yes sir I sure was identified with him that's exactly right was identified there at at the grave of Lazarus when he raised up [Music] Lazarus I was identified with the woman at the well when he told her her sins yes sir I surely was identified with him and his death and I was identified with him in his first EAS I raised with him from Death you have to identify yourself with that moment when he gave life and hope to a world full of Darkness that that had no Redemption had no fellowship with their creator you need to identify and say had it not been for him I would not be here how can you identify you have to have the same Spirit you have to have that spirit that makes you do the same things that he did oh Brothers everyone can say if I had been there that day if I was there at that moment I wouldn't have denied the Lord Jesus but we deny him daily we deny him even when we come to church yes sometimes there's unbelief amongst us we are standing we are standing with that great multitude that heard him on on that M when he gave that great preaching of the Beatitudes there at the Sea of Galilee put yourself there what do you think of him what do you think of that man what do you think of that man that said that said blessed are those that are poor in spirit what do you think of that bearded man what do you think of him will you follow him will give will you give your life for him will you just be one of those that heard him and you went home and that that was the end of it I don't want to be like that I want to be with those that followed him brother brandham says was with the 120 in the upper room I was identified up there with him with them could you identify with them think about it before you say Amen have you been waiting for the Holy Spirit have you stayed have you stayed waiting upon the holy ghost waiting for the Holy Ghost have you stayed at the altar can you identify with them perhaps not perhaps we haven't waited enough perhaps we're with those that get desperate we get impatient impatient and we may say perhaps it's not for me who do you identify with it's until that same spirit is in us that we begin to connect with the 120 there's something in us if we are a part of him Brothers there's something that will connect us something that may that will say if he can then I can if they waited I need to wait as well they believed I need to believe as well should be something that connects us something that tells us it can be done it can be done we're not alone it can be done Church we're not going to do we're not going to be like them that just heard Jesus and didn't follow him until the I want to follow him to the upper room I want to connect with them I don't want to just talk about I want to be with all want talk I want to be a part of what God is doing oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah she says I was with the 120 in the upper room I was identified up there with them oh I feel religious I was identified there I'm one of them oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah if we have the same father if we have the same Spirit we need to be one of them as well I am one of them I was identified I got the same experience they had oh hu Hallelujah perhaps some of us could say oh I feel sad I don't believe I'm one of them perhaps I haven't had the same experience but maybe there's something in you in the depth of your soul that says I desire to have that experience that they had I was there when it happened to be a true Christian I witnessed the mighty rushing wind coming I witnessed that I felt the power of God as it shook I was with them that spoke in tongues I felt the didn't come in there I was with them I was identified with them when the Holy Ghost began to speak through tongues with them I was with Peter before the critics in Acts two when he preached a great sermon I was identified with him yes sir saying that we were there as well a true child of God connects to the original connects back there because he knows that he comes before the foundation of the world hallu Hallelujah brother we don't just connect to the day of Pentecost tell where were you when I founded the Earth you were a part of that Foundation a child of God connects oh Church a child of God connects the rest of the temple of God a child of God connects with the foundation connects with what Paul preached connects with the original message Brothers you can't do but nothing else but say Amen when you hear the original word there's something within you that connects there's something that connects something that tells you that says I'm going back I'm a part of them if I came with Paul I would stand with Paul oh Brothers come on Church come on Church we're cowards sometimes yes they were the same before they Reed the Holy Spirit but there's something when you receive the Holy Ghost there's something that says I'm not a coward I'm like the ones that stood for Jesus I could be a coward before receiving the Holy Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost you are no longer C you are one of them you are one with one with Peter one with John you were on the a of Patmos with John if you connect you understand you understand you appreciate it you appreciate you come to church you say thank you God thank you God this is the least I could do want to stand for you once again in this difficult time in this hard time just like Paul he would stand at this time I want to give me that nature give me that desire to stand in this time oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah the Bible says having this great cloud of witnesses all the children of God have had to fight in their generation to receive the holy spirit in their generation see yes we will not be an exception to that God says you have to live the same life you have to suffer the same way to pay the same price it's not so that we would be slothful brothers they didn't pay the price so that we could be slothful or lazy I I there are millionaires that they leave everything for their children and they never have to work they never have to give an effort but brother brandom says that God doesn't have grandchildren he has original sons and do and everyone has to come the same manner have to come in the same manner if Paul fought pet was crucified if James was cut in half imagine being sought in half if they had to do that then who are we to have an easy life Brothers perhaps they won't saw you in half but you have to kill yourself you have to kill your will kill those desires you have to give your life for this message you have to show that you're a child of God We complain about the problems complain about our life oh Lord forgive us forgive us it's time to connect ourselves to what they were in the beginning to what the true child of God is to feel what they felt to understand them to understand someone you have to go through the same [Music] thing and we're suffering and we're we're we're become traitors it seems like we can't we withstand anything but godliness be like him to be like the children of God it allows you to understand to understand comprehend what they were able to understand I believe it's worth it to give it all for him doesn't matter the price I have to pay it is worth it even what is going on right now it is worth it say it's worth it it's worth it do you believe it's worth it it's worth it it is worth it the musicians can't come forward when you are a pillar you are an essential part you understand that you understand that God needs us right God says I will make you a pillar a pillar is something essential for the building without it the building is not right I tell you if you're a child of God God needs you God needs you he needs us to stand firm oh church sometimes we don't realize how much God needs us I was meditating what if I would have already given up you ever thought
