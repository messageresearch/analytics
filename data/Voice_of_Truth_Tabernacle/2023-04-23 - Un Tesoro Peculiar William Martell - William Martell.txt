Colorado Springs Colorado was able to bring a few uh Brethren from there and then we have visitors also from Greeley and and uh and from Denver International I thank them for coming as well for the invitation this morning I know it's been a while since I've been here I was trying to remember I think it was about five years is what we kind of concluded a lot of buildings been going on yeah but I got to enjoy part of the service this morning and I see a lot of building going on yeah I believe the word of God is abundant and the edification of the body of Christ is prevalented I don't want to keep you standing for a long time so if you take and turn with me in your Bible to the Book of Exodus chapter 19 we're going to take four verses verses three through six and it reads like this and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel Israel ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine voice and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel let us pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord once again for your mercy and Grace this morning we thank you for providing a place for us Lord to meet in thy divine presence we ask Lord as we have taken a portion of thy words [Music] and open it up Lord and give us the context Lord bless each one that believes Thy word father and if there are any here Lord that do not know you Lord or or and and your word Lord may they come to know you today we commit ourselves to you Lord in this time of service asking for forgiveness of our shortcomings that there'll be no hindrance lord of the moving of thy Spirit speak to us now Lord as only you can Senor for we commit ourselves to you asking you these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated I'd like to read once again verse 5. and from this particular verse we're going to draw our title this morning and Moses writes one more time Moses right and and it's said here now therefore if ye obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure vosotros me Especial unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine I like to title this morning's message there are many things that we can say this morning but time does not permit so I'll just try to hit high points but as we believe in what God is doing in our day he has a Ministry that he uses these are the Servants of God yes they don't lift them so we rely upon the word of God we rely upon the spirit of in my own studies and when I am inspired on a particular message I use that sermon as my my reference point so many times I'll have quotes from that sermon what I like to do is I like to give those sermons because the children of God do not just eat the word of God on Sundays the Believers do not just trust God one day out of the week we do not just look for the spiritual food and due season one day out of the week so we like to make time to Feast on the word of God throughout the week so there's two sermons the first sermon is 5308 31. titled God talk to Moses the second sermon is 6005-15 yes the rejected King I'd like to title this morning's message did I give the title already peculiar A peculiar treasure and just for the background now but uh uh we see that that Moses is having a conversation with god this is after after they have come out of Egypt how many knows that Moses was the servant of God the beliefs that Moses existed nobody ever met Moses in here you don't see this actually happening but yet your faith believes as we see this story unfolds I want to lay this foundation for this message this morning that when when God is speaking to Moses that there were many experiences that Moses had before God spoke to Moses before God spoke to Moses out of the burning bushes and there was a reason why the burning bush happened the experience of The Burning Bush was set for Moses but God had this plan to speak to Moses All Along we heard a little bit about the plan this morning this has always been part of the planet for God forgot to have an expression and as Moses is is growing up in the land of Egypt I want to emphasize that he was not Egyptian he grew up amongst the Egyptians where he realized he was somebody else from another [Music] it was never supposed to be that but we do have a god this morning and if you're still in bondage this is so Moses God is dealing with Moses Anton says and he he notices something on a mountain and he sees a bush that is burning but is not consumed so he recognizes the light and that's what is attracting him yes and he doesn't know so he realizes he's got to get a little closer for him to get a little closer stop what he's doing see what this bush that doesn't burn is not being consumed so he starts because the servant of God is not taking the people of God to a different place of experience is the same place [Applause] God calls him so God speaks to him first in his heart just like God spoke to us Puerta we walked into a church service and heard the preaching of the word and it was the word of which is God speaking to our hearts yes then we begin to hear God and that's what happened with Moses they step they they have left now Egypt but I want you to understand something greater in the Servants of God that when God speaks to one of his servants most of the time it is for the benefit of who he's the messenger too as far as Hittle so God is speaking to Moses speaking to his heart benefited Moses from the burning bush that benefited Moses from the mountains that benefited Moses but it was for the children so all this is going on Ministry and calling of Moses amen amen it was for the benefit of the people of god let's take our text so he tells Moses that he calls Moses and he says this is what I want you to say to the house of Jacob tell the children of Israel that ye have seen what I I did unto the Egyptians you see the children of Israel were Witnesses of the power of God they were Witnesses of the Miracles they were Witnesses because they were there experiencing this firsthand this is why the gospel many times we can relate and we begin to identify with this word that's been increments now he's pointing out now that that you saw what I did to the Egyptians what what God did [Music] listen now God Specializes especially in those things not impossible it was an impossible appearance wow the Israel's in trouble now problems oh wow this this man or this woman or this child is in trouble what are they going to get out of this same way Israel got out of it is what God did to the Egyptians amen he says you saw what I did unto the Egyptians how did I bear you upon now somewhere along the line here in Exodus and I I I believe it it uh I don't have it written down but there is a passage of text that God says to Israel that your enemies if you'll obey my voice will be my enemies your adversaries will be my side this is what God is showing the children of Israel with the Egyptians didn't start out as their enemies they weren't enemies but then there arose a pharaoh who knew not Joseph and that's what drew the people of God into slavery yes and if you notice laws that get passed and things that we have to deal with yes they don't have a relationship mandatos so he says your enemies are going to be my enemies took everything everything [Music] we we can't foreign to go worship God and they back themselves up against the Red Sea yes [Applause] and this is what I really like God is he's he's the ultimate strategisters he he have to read how do you say it like re-plan ET like plan a and plan B and the plan a doesn't work then we go to plan bunches and we don't need another guy the plan is the word of God and as they're ladder their their backs are against us and they're facing towards where God's leading them yes [Music] foreign foreign but God is speaking to him he's saying come down today God does battle for you because they were being led into the Wilderness he put himself between his children the kingdom of God is the children of God and the cloud is standing stand between the children of Israel Egyptians from the Egyptians that separates us from the agility the cloud was not for the Egyptians from the Egyptians amen amen the Egyptian Egypt was a type of the world and in this type the Egyptians the the the the people of Egypt were chasing after Israelites chasing after the people of God now when they were in Egypt but when they came out of Egypt the Church of God so the Egyptians were chasing after the Church of God and the enemy chases after the Church of God and when it chases after them it is not because it's your friend he just was chasing after Israel to score them and to kill them it is surrender to the leadership of God because when you're doing what God tells you to do if you understand to calm you when you're Restless amen amen I want to read a quote una Sita from the message of the hour God talked to Moses 5308-31 and and it reads like this now remember Egypt is the world and the children of Israel are the Church of God the world is behind them we're facing towards the word right fulfillment of the promises of God we're facing we're being part of the plan of God brother Branham says now the world is looking for good mixers but God's looking for separators for those who will separate themselves I'm gonna pause right there that's just like Moses nobody the Egyptians didn't teach him you know what you should go back to your people and say yeah you should start living right now you should do what's right that's what pulls you let's look at Ohio State it's not a different God it is the pool was from the inside and he made a decision because of the word that was coming to him that you and how many knows what it is first before God gives his word it's a thought yes yes we begin to think a little bit differently if I could just get a little closer sir but if it stays with the word that's the word of God it's the thought of God you can't come back so God's looking for separation for those that will separate themselves while we were yet sinners before we even confessed the sacrifice was already made sure in Egypt the lamb was offered God Made A Difference he made the difference he separated the Israelites he separated us from the Gentiles we are called to be a separated and made the difference in them and God's people is a separated a holy Nations so the world will never understand get over it septelo you never be like the world because you were made for you [Applause] so just don't think about the world think about God that's the main thing watch this oh man he tells Moses hey lady someone says to tell this to the children of Israel Israel and he says that that see what I did to the Egyptians On Eagle's Wings do you remember the wings right do you remember the wings the prophet taught us it was Old Testament and New testamento the prophet taught us that the law is a shadow of things to come so even in the symbol that God is using to speak to the children of Israel of God in the Old Testament that new testamento Just Like Us in the New Testament we identify God and his people and what he's done they in the old testamento always looked for something that God was going to do in the future brothers and sisters we are the future we are these this this new testament Bros somebody's going to fulfill that might as well be me as well be one of them if you stay with the word the Old and New Testament what did he bring them to do Moses didn't bring them to another Nation he brought them to the Mount of God he brought them to the place where he had a personal experience with God experience our Prophet said that no man deserves to be behind this sacred desk experience amazing but as we've heard all the children of God have got to have a burning bush experience experience is not limited to the ministry God didn't just want to speak to Moses he used Moses to speak to Israel says the friends to the bridegrooms you know they just don't whatever it is in the natural don't have the nerves you know she said hi to me everybody she shook my hand she's in line shaking everybody's head I know but this was different what is that something on the inside right and the word that God gives was for the children of Israel Israel I mean this is the great part of it to me Moses isn't excluded he's one of the members of the children of Israel that's right and when he's giving this word the word of God Moses is saying exactly what God is saying to him when you read a little bit better it tells you it tells you how he did it Moses being the prophet of God messenger of the days the Church of God Grande as Moses going to speak to every member of the church Israel but what did he do but okay he was called so he decided to return the gesture Anton says and he called the elders and they weren't just any Elders the Elders of the people they didn't have any other ulterior motives one more time ulterior motives they didn't have any other uh plans motivos another plan they didn't have a different place they were just going to say the same thing that Moses told them to say so they call the children of Israel and they repeat the same thing Anton says looking for a different message Lord God amen amen look it figures he says now therefore this if ye will obey my voice indeed now this isn't just obey my voice may my voice indeed so it isn't just like say amen amen it isn't just like I agree with this it is it just that I I could see what he's saying but indeed is to do what it says it's to do it to obey my voice indeed prove that you're obeying the voice whose voice is it come on depends on what's being said depends and the anointing behind it this word is amen amen amen obey my voice indeed all right and keep my Covenant now this is important that is as God is giving his word he's giving it to Moses to give to the elders and the children of Israel so it's important that God trusts the man that he's giving the message now that friend has got to make a judgment call All right we don't just want anybody to interfere with this this scene this circumstance so who he gives it to as a friend has also got to be worthy men to keep with the same message that his friend first gave me God doesn't doesn't change his mind about his work this is why his voice is so important foreign and in this plan God sees it all yes and what we are seeing before our very eyes they can't redo the Old Testament coming out of Egypt so God confirmed amen [Music] it's spoken about you this is the word of God is fulfilled in your day before your very eyes members in particulars that are supposed to have this word fulfilled in their lives that means don't discard it don't discard the Covenant that I've giveness don't discard the Covenant that I agreed to no service well how long is it going to take brother Williams yes sir God's timing is perfect I'm good with it um amen amen amen amen look at how important it is to stay with the word we we it's important to say what the word says thousands of years hundreds of years later we see the psalmist David writing a song and in this song 135 4 El salmos for the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself and Israel Israel for his peculiar treasure Generations later King David is holding on to the same words but he's keeping the Covenant that God gave us but speaking the covenants keeping it in the forefronto put it on a shelf and store it away amen amen and it's the same plan for us today the only difference is the dispensations [Music] and we find and pick it up in the new testamento the New Testament isn't listen to this brothers and sisters it isn't a different word it isn't a different God it's a different dispensation first Peter 2 9. but ye are a chosen generation yes sir a royal priesthood Unholy Nations what does it mean to be peculiar okay significance basic definition means not ordinary definition anybody ever feel like they're odd like not ordinary I'm just not like everybody else God knows you know what God's not like all the other so-called Gods out there in Egypt either he brought him to himself Peter says that he should show forth the Praises of him who called you it's the same word it's the same God cause to show forth his purpose to reveal irrever his praises to reveal the Praises of him that has called you today Pueblo we worship God because of an experience not just because we just I was raised in church so I just raised my hands because we're identified identified it's not even the way we dress it's not even the way we worship what makes us peculiar is what causes us to do those things an experience with God coming out of Egypt and he called them out of Darkness into his marvelous life out of Darkness into his marvelous life out of Darkness into His Marvelous I said this to a man the other day and I'm going to close with this as I was speaking to this man I got on to talking about the peculiarity of God's people it's it's God himself but it's not like God himself over there it's God himself in his people his people having fellowship with him and I I I told him I says and this is the power of God the way that he he likes to show himself how he has chosen Israel or chosen the church his word to them and you know first we're like Moses you see God got his attention that's why he left Egypt but he wasn't on the mountain when he left Egypt he wasn't in the presence of God when he left Egypt who made the decisions he heard our Prophet say it took 40 years for Egypt to put in him how to be a good Egyptian yeah see he was a good Egyptian but he was an Egyptian could you imagine if you really figured out who he was and what he was going to be like if he was a good Egyptian and he realized he's a child of God how much when he knows where he's really supposed to be and this light is shining in a bush yes but the light is calling him not with an audible voice but with interest with inspiration on inspiration with with a a an emotion consentimiento of Faith they're fair that I I need to turn aside and see what that's about he had to believe he could he could get there before it went out I believe that he I however long it's going to take for me to get there I'm going to keep my eye on it I'm going to I'm keep I'm going towards it and God knowing the whole time that he was going to talk to Moses oh he saw what he didn't say hey look there's God in the form of the pillar of fire there in the bush he didn't say that he was like man there's this bush that's burning I did surely everything I've been doing has been for a reason right over there it's not being consumed I gotta check this out foreign for the ground that you stand on is Holy Ground Santa is that's the same grounds of time give you yourself stood on Monday nobody could ever take away from you nobody could ever explain it away from me you took off your shoes Dios Hallelujah The Peculiar treasure El Tesoro special is a treasure that is possessed or owned by someone and this peculiar treasure that Israel is yes is owned by the same person as as the Bride of Jesus Christ is owned by La Novia de Jesus Christ we are A peculiar people it means an acquisition something that has been purchased and we are told in our Bible that we are not our own that price was Ultimate yes where God sold everything that he has he gave up everything that he has as God couldn't change even though he gave everything up even though he became a man he should not stop being God because he doesn't change he left eternity Elohim Elohim the position of almighty God he left that to begin creation but it didn't change and that was God wasn't done he saw a man fall he saw the whole purpose of creating and he says I got to make this right I've always wanted to have fellowship with them to have fellowship with them to save them now I could do it from up here but I really want them to know how much I really care important I'm gonna go where they are right where you are many of us hit rock bottoms right where we were is he wasn't so holy he says oh man them people are messed up yes Lord they got problems yes Lord SI senor where else could I go but [Music] and watch what he says even the world tried to condemned that was caught in the very Act of sin right woman where's thine accusers they're gone neither do I condemn you know the very one that could have condemned and he didn't condemnon now I don't know if all of you can identify with what I'm saying but I want to say this right where you are if you will answer the call that God has put in your life regardless of what you've gone through regardless of your circumstances if you will just answer the call knows how to deal with it knows where he has you may not be called for this position or this other positions God's place that he called me foreign don't wait any longer but leave all that he's provided for you with every headbound if you're here this morning and you know now maybe you heard something about the grace of God but now you're beginning to experience the grace of God you're facing towards the lights the call of God yeah don't let another day go by why would you rather stay in Egypt to be a slave in Egypt when there is so much more God has provided foreign where you have to have everything in order you can't leave the country anymore without having everything in order you gotta have things in order going in a Rapture is superior to that you are not going in a Rapture without having everything whatever you lack now get in order now if you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord there ain't no better way better day than today if you need to come to the altar to repentance there ain't no better day than today God if you need the Holy Ghost there ain't no better day than today if you need another experience or a greater experience there ain't no better day than today you can't leave in
