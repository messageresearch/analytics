ties in the office okay I'm missing this song think about it [Music] and think about his grace [Music] great is the measure of our father [Music] s go about his love let's think about his good Ness oh think about his dreams [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] Hermanos God bless you brother problems you've probably already seen what's on my head significa but knowing what it means it's God upon us and I liked how our Pastor said let's be a little different yeah [Music] and that's to preach in Spanish and it's something I believe every person is wanting to do something better something different to better themselves I also want to identify with my brothers I'm not sure when God will allow me to see them but it doesn't mean that when I can go I start practice if you can follow me to Philippians 1 verse 6 yes [Music] allowing me and my brothers to preach [Music] being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ I'm not sure if this brings you Joy or gladness and where he begins he has to finish I will be making a prayer and his presence amen I give you thanks not deserving anything but you gave us the best gift your only begotten son Lord you love so much Lord is and why shouldn't we give the best of ourselves surrender them to you I ask you take control of your servant and my other brothers we surrender this service we ask all these things and the previous time I said are watching yes God put them in my memory and in my heart although they're not here physically I have them in my heart we miss you and we love you Josue so not our brother Felix and brother Josue together we got this title the resolution he is a resolution that he is a resolution yes we're closing the year now and I asked our pastor what do you like for us to preach we continue with the characters of The Bible and he please in having an end of year a subject and I said well if God allows I want to touch on every character we've spoken of yes and through the Holy Ghost God led me and I went to Google and I was looking for an article that would give me more resolutions why people fail in their uh New Year's dresses because if there's someone that fails in their resolutions because I believe there's a federal that failed so I found this article [Music] and he gave me 16 reasons why you fall short but of these 16 I want to share five years and the first one is you put the cart before the horse and the next one says you don't enjoy the process third is you don't track your Pros progress fourth you have no social support and the fifth one I love how it sounds in Spanish [Music] you know you're what but not your why okay rhyme [Music] no that's not the reason a I we're angry says well like Moses he allows us to make mistakes so that later God will show himself allows it for a reason it is the message remembering the Lord he says decision it's right there the first quote Oh if there's a decision to be made let esperemonos let's wait remember what kind of decision we think he would make [Music] then let that be our decision if we get history let's remember he was never in a hurry then says if we get over anxious remember he dwells in eternity time means nothing to him it's the motive and objective of our hearts more say no let's remember him give me if it's hard to understand me but um but what I understand and it's great what our brother Brandon says that time means nothing to him many times and and uh the end of the year comes and we feel now we can now is my time that's where we're failing because we're waiting for the situation and that's the only way God can work also works in disorders and God has shown it many times God allows them to for sure more than 40 years foreign of continuing to the second point you don't enjoy the process that's tremendous because many times there are two sides of the coin and especially youth we use this often I'm in the process as my mother says well you're not going to stay there out of that process she has a strong character is brought my process but when I think about this I say God how did Abraham do it 25 years enjoying the processando you need all the tools [Music] [Music] there's a difference also helps us through the process every day he Rejoice even if he didn't see results and if we're Abrahams for Father Abraham seeds then we take every promise God man amen amen no importance no matter how ridiculous it looks like how it could not happen but if God said so now Abraham when he was supposed to have this foreign foreign [Music] battle star Allegre but if you can be glad just that you're waking up or getting up yeah and doing more than what you used to Cristiano I believe a Christian if God allows him to stop speaking yes the small things small things God works in more it says you don't track your progress and I believe as youth that's something we should do yo Mexican more than anyone I identify with this is because we know we aren't what we should be but as our sister said we aren't what we used to be either foreign [Music] [Music] and he knows that you're giving your best effort he yeah and he knows that you will fail pero but he has given us his word so that we're in whenever we're in that dark moment yes sir with the right words maneuver us from that mentals I'm not sure if anyone has been in that dark moment where you feel the worst greatest hypocrite in church feeling that you don't do anything right feeling that you let the whole world down yeah and I'm opening my heart a little here feeling every time people see me they see a two-face but by God's grace Uno [Music] Psalms 1 1. but by God's grace he gave me this one Psalms 32. I don't have it there in English but I'm going to say it in English blessed is he whose transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man who the Lord does not impute iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no deceited you know what iniquity means knowing to do what's right yeah doing wrong or evil and I believe this verse the scripture is a great gift God has given me knowing I would be in a dark moment knowing that I would commit iniquity but he knew I needed to know something he gave me such a great gift his only begotten son is can be here sitting God bless you brother God bless you Brothers the title is the resolution is him if we could just give a clap offering to brother Gustavo Gustavo he did such an amazing job I I look up to him even though he's younger than me yeah I I look up to him your last middle the way he serves God he helps out in many different places and I believe that he is a blessed young man and something that he said in this verse on the good things God has given us it's not the exact the verse were you reading I'm just I'm just repeating what he said and and then I like the last part of the verse that he read amen well he begins he will finish that means he will not leave something halfway done where he starts okay well God starts he will finish and if you can open your scriptures to James chapter 1 Ayan Santiago UNO verse 17 verse I would like to thank God for this opportunity for putting this trust in Meza every gift and every perfect gift is from above and they cometh down from the fathers from the father of light and who it variableness neither a shadow of turning I wanna I I when when I found out I was going to preach the this week I I started talking to the brothers what were we going to talk about and I thought we were going to continue talking about the Bible characters that he already had talked to brother and he wanted us to talk about something about the end of the year and as I started to meditate you know I started to think about it you know um since it's the end of the year you know it's a time that people give a lot you know a lot of people give gifts you know we start checking our resolutions what we what we said we're gonna do at the beginning of the year we want to say we say oh that I that I accomplished the goals that I said I was going to accomplish and I said like some of us in the beginning of the year we say I'm gonna lose weight and we end up eating more yeah you know we end up gaining more weight so we must have peso you know some of us say I'm gonna save more money this year I'm going to try to get my credit score you know we or when Christmas comes around you know it's Christmas is this weekend we're always waiting to see what kind of gift we're going to receive you know we want we want to get get what we we want to receive what we're hoping we want to receive we so sometimes we're like oh I want this I want that all right and when we don't receive it sometimes sometimes we get mad I remember when I was a kid you know I I used to tell my parents I want this I want that I want the fastest remote control car in the whole neighborhood you know and they would just give me clothes so when I started working you know I started buying myself something nice every year for Christmas you know I would treat myself you know but I I believe as us Christians you know we received the best gifts more than 2 000 years ago I said and that was is Jesus Christ as we know he didn't come around this time you know we as we know he didn't come around this time as the world makes it seems you know but we re but but when he came he he gave us the best gift that anybody could ever receive it's better than any car as my whole cake it's any better than any piece of jewelry is better than any pair of shoes any purse any iPad anything he is the best thing that he could give us and I believe that is the best thing foreign and he he surrendered everything at Calvary he said it is finished he said it is done and he went down to the depths of house and he conquered every demons conquered every sickness and he came back up and he came back and he poured himself in his children he poured every single of himself and his children and that is the best thing that we could ever receive I I think that's to be the that we should all be grateful for them but I am happy that there is no sickness that can beat me that can beat me brothers and sisters there is no demon that can take you down and say God it is yours there is nothing that can take me down nothing that can stop me there is nothing that can beat me to the ground because you already took everything for me you know and sometimes like Christmas you know I'm saying this for myself you know God is just waiting for us he is waiting for us to receive him no sir all those good things that you have foreign I want to give myself God to you I want to give myself more to God you know I'm tired of failing I'm tired of stumbling I don't know who else is tired of that year after year we go through the same thing we say we're gonna do something and we don't do it we go again year after year and say God I'm gonna do this forget about those goals about putting up your credit score is saving up more money hey I don't know about you but I won 2023 I want to surrender more to God you this is the last service foreign [Music] what are we doing with the Holy Spirit you know I wasn't going to probably speak this week please maybe that's why I want to speak to my children that's how I want to help I see let's get on you that that's how I want to surrender myself it doesn't matter how how dirty I am you know God still wants to use you like that Garfield wants to use you little by little I want yours he doesn't expect you to come perfect he wants you to be a working process [Music] and he will be there to help you I want to close with this quote foreign expectations expectations preached in 1953 the only thing you have to you have to do is look at Calvary and accept what God has already done for you there it is it's already finished it is finished then I was saved Anton says Salvo I I would say I was saved 20 years ago no I will save 1900 years ago 20 years ago when Christ died he paid the penis he paid for of both sin and sickness and sickness is in attribute attribute of sin foreign if we see everything that he's already given us everything that he has blessed us with if we would just give him a little piece of our time even if it's just three seconds a day I don't care foreign just to say thank you guys you know he would appreciate that but he wants us to give him more he wants us to give more to him if we could just surrender everything to him that's all I have brothers [Applause] is Christ hey man um I appreciate him a lot yes his brother Felix an example I see them and they gave me courage to continue in the steps I believe to every one of us we should be an example he wants to speak specifically to one person I would like to read Ephesians 2 and verse 4 it is amor a God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead incense had quickened us together with Christ by Grace you're safe and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hey man amen is Mercy is when we found out we're gonna bring an end of your thought um this was what was in my heart and it was perfect brother Felix tonight um in the previous years a four-year yo message and I feel very blessed to be here Mercy I'm here Grandes [Music] have great great youth leaders great musicians ushers sound everything is a great blessing in my heart because we're here again because we're still in the battle guess the problem I'm not sure what your problems well you're still here in church maybe this you wanted to leave God still has you here I'm not sure Brothers wanted to throw the towel well you're still here this year I truly have nothing to say I still feel thankful to God the best way to thank God is with my life foreign it seemed like I wasn't going to preach this and also me because that's what the devil wants the devil doesn't want to hear it we aren't perfect yo okay um I saw that I was gonna Iglesia Grande song lyrics it was our church was a great church um you know I'm very happy I know I'm not the owner foreign for me it's been the best year of my life I moved here God provided Fernando yes no you don't understand sometimes I didn't understand at the beginning Minnesota foreign with me because I don't want the youth to go through what I've gone through you know one more time I want the youth to be here in church it's foreign has a lot of things to deceive our youth with this is the last youth service to God the world is not good youth there's a lot of Sorrow out there is and they want to feel better and they drink they get high scores just to feel better and I understood that because I did it I remember when I was sitting drunk that's it and I I would say is that it you know message in the beginning I felt weird when I was I fell out of place you know it's not the place we're in the best place to die for us receive did you come with an expectation tonight yesterday I spoke with my mother and I felt something strong pain and sadness you're not saying and I asked God why do I feel this way I'm not sure feels that way might be someone else tonight to God he is the answer to our problems I want to read a quote from Brother Branham musicians can come and the message the certain secret going away of the church foreign I now wish to give my testimony and my surrender to the Lord Jesus which I have done last night and the Pastor said well I'm glad to hear about that John is you know that you have finally decided to come and give yourself to the Lord forgive me the pastor's house of Manito sentimientos because we don't want to hurt your feelings and we

you have come forward I'm going to surrender yourself to the Lord Jesus to serve him he said thank you Pastor says algo then I just want to ask you something is what sermon did I preacher what text did I use or what song was sung in church what made you decide to do this and as the man looked at him in the face with tears running off his cheeks said pastor Mones Pastor was none of your sermons though as good as they were none of them a knife I've said everything to him I've called him a holy rollers a religious fanatic and everything and it don't bother him a bit but he lives so finally in my heart all along he has won a place I want to be like that man yes and that's the reason that I asked him I wanted the Christ that he said do you see Pastor God does work through the passage to get his church ready he works through the songs together he works through you get his church ready foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] around [Music] your way without knowing about Jesus what type of Life do
