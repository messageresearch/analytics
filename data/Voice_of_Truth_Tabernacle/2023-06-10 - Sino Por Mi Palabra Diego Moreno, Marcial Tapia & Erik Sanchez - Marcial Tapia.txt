Uncle I mean it's a familiar scripture at least I hope it is um and it reads like this it says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet El profetely before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse amen amen so God chooses Elijah amen I believe that God chose the right man for the right time amen and brother Branham Elementary he puts this in a very awesome way that I really like brother Branham says he says that Allah Elijah heard the still Small Voice and he says this in the message what do is thou here it is in 1959 he says we've had the Thunders we've had the fires we've had the Russian women and the earthquakes send us this still Small Voice that's what we need listen Brothers we need that still Small Voice a still Small Voice amen I believe that that's what God was trying to do here in this situations is that God was trying to steal the people of Israel to get them back to him amen and I think that oftentimes when things happen in our lives it's not that God's being unfair with us or that he's angry or trying to punish us okay but when God takes things away God is trying to steal us so that we can hear that still Small Voice God works in Stillness amen he stops the rain he stops the Harvest to get everyone to be still and to recognize that he's the true God there's a scripture here yeah I just want to read for a quick reference it's a Psalms 46 10. and it reads like this is be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the heathens I will be exalted in the Earth at the end of the day God gets all the glory amen whether or not we give it to him that's our choice right amen another thing that I noticed was that when God speaks there's something out there that has to respond when Elijah the rain wouldn't come down so in this story it was the nature that responded amen but in our time we know that it was a deep calling to a deep we know that it was Brother Bruno's message and that something has to respond and this was a mystery to me for a really long time I didn't understand what a deep was and I still kind of I still I'm kind of starting to understand it a little bit more yeah any time I read it but what I'm able to capture from what brother Branham says it's a call and and it's a call from God yes so and he says that God wouldn't make that call amen but the way amen [Music] amen God is good Brothers amen it's in the times when God speaks to us that we have to be still often times I wanted for God to just an audible voice just come and speak to me but God in himself if he never spoke to me in an audible Voice or through a sign or something that I knew perfectly well it was for me he wouldn't be wrong because his word is enough the Bible says that greater is he who did not see and still believed amen so if I never I never see him down here Anton says then I know for sure I'm gonna see him up there yeah man praise be to God amen amen now we just have to question ourselves again is whether or not we're going to allow them into our lives and if not then what's the reason that we're not going to let him into our lives amen for Israel they didn't have them in their lives because they had a God in his place amen and maybe we have another God In This Place sometimes we're the god ourselves we worship ourselves and there's no room for God Amen I take pride in my education um but I've realized that I've only gotten this far by the grace of God so anything that we do it always points back to God whether or not we acknowledge that that's our choice amen but if we don't serve God we're going to be serving something else I would rather serve a God who knows and cares for me and something that's Eternal something that's going to last then something that I very well know that it could not be here the day of tomorrow amen that's all I have God bless you is [Applause] Vita foreign as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor Reign these years but according to my word so we're going to stay on this phrase but according to my word um what a wonderful scripture Vida and what a wonderful life now we know the Bible doesn't tell us a lot of how he was brought up or raised we believe God does Supernatural things focusing on the news but I just want to share a little on Elijah how he appears I believe God's word because I believe when the devil thinks the devil thinks he has when the devil thinks he has us not always sends someone esteem the seed of God is now this was in the years now if you want to find out about history go and find out about history it was a time where there was so much yes now they are together and the Bible says [Music] word of God the message without an eye hold up do you think you could leave this building you heard this word come to me follow me come to me now you can open your eyes because I'm leading you as a leader from the conditions from this Darkness we won't leave that is now how many youth have not been filthy or dirty but now as a question how many of the ones here we fail daily yes that's wonderful so be sincere that we need of God's house we can't make it alone because I'm a message Apostle Paul says this is important now this man's father was a bad King Samaria who did evil on the sight of the Lord above all that were before him the Lord above all that were before him imagine the type of King leading Israel how these people in a great confusion so an Earthly kingdom yes for this flesh that pleases this fleshosos or enemies now that's what helps us control ourselves now we're all tempted not because we're message Believers we think we're holy amen sometimes the devil lies I'm a message Believers yes you should be careful amen Brothers and it came to pass as as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins it was very light for him of all that he did he got used to it he got away from the things of God Holiness and get more filthy yes you're used to it foreign okay after this man got married he went and served is and after he served him says he worshiped him and then now Elijah they had gone away from Godly things from Holiness from worshiping from harm yeah that's how it happens to us we get used to coming yes I'm falling asleep because that also foreign [Music] transfer us amen brethren amen we're only speaking what do you need in this night [Music] there should be a pain in us and on this Earth in this night all right amen [Music] sir amen my time is over and this is youth according to his word [Applause] God bless you brother forgive me for taking a bit of time I don't want to interrupt my brothers I'd like to just thank God foreign thank you very much with is now we're on Elijah um my wife told me Dios how much did God didn't love the spirit of Elijah five times we'll use him five times he has used his Spirit four times and that's something tremendous [Music] how much did God love this man that he used him over and over now look if you see the Bible there aren't any great presentations for this man in in in Primera de Reyes and First Kings this man appears on the scene but not a lot of mentioned about it is or a great last name he just appears on the scene on the contrary foreign thou are anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so perfect that was perfect from the day that thou was created so iniquity was found in the multitude is by the multitude of that merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and now has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy the old covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee you know I believe the real seed of God The Real Son of God presentations yes there's simpleness the prophet says and he wore camel skins maybe with a tan skin of the heat that was the man God wanted to use Hermanos as our brothers said than his ancestors he began to worship this God bail yesterday and you know this God was the god of fertility then he meets Jezebel and Jezebel adorable worshiped this uh goddess assured Ash astroth the mother of all the gods but then God comes and says we're going to test the goddess and according to my words for three and a half years and make rain but nothing would happen nothing would happen there was three and a half years of drought wow everything foreign now look and it's a dimple and that time they lived off with the ground cave and for a consequence they needed water they weren't as we are in this time that maybe if I don't like what my mother cooked me what a Burger King Chick-fil-A no no no no no no they had to sustain them on what the ground gave them but the ground was dry there was not a drop of rain the skies were clean there was no signs of classes for the cause the sin of this King and of the people of Israel right I don't know if you have the pictures of the Gods that was uh garpeo I said yours this God is that's the guard they began to worship for them I was the god of fertility knowing who Jehovah was he turned his heart to these Gods the next picture the goddess of all gods the one Jezebel worshiped well let me tell you something there isn't anyone foreign [Music] Branham says see what our brother Brandon says he was ahab's Pastor no no whatever referring to Elijah Elias includes Elijah was the pastor of ahabel he was the pastor of Jezebel yeah but he was a man that told her where she was living that's correct he was her pastor she hated him nevertheless he was the gift for her provider from God said tell her her sins and she failed to see it you know what I'm speaking about look forgive me for saying this is many times we come to church we don't take our pastors seriously many times how many believe that brethren but many times ignoramus we ignore them what God has given okay God puts in our mids continue saying and then Jesus came listen and Jesus Jesus was the gift of God for Israel Mundo for the world that's correct Jesus Jesus was God's gift for so God love the world I gave his only began you believe it soon we have a pastor moreover and he is named Jesus now look in that time this is dark a lot of people began to die or died of starvation and then here's a widow knocking at her door but God will never leave or never forget his seed s we want to close with this the musicians can come referring to the Widow brother Branham the Widow made the cake and gave it to the prophet is she made for her and her son and ate for many days where did that come from how did they get there referring to the cakes can someone scientifically explain where more flour and oil came from how they came into the vessels now like a Time came o where she only had a little bit left but when this Prophet Elijah came I hear you to her yeah she is could have more days to live and that God is that created the squirrels was that same guy that never let that vest that jar Sebastian be empty he can make your situation be a little difficult but if you take his word and you are certain that he is God foreign [Music] cloudy Earth when you see the picture from a distance it seems like the most horrible thing is it's like if the clouds got mixed is you can see that from far but when you get close to the picture the picture changes and this is similar the picture is similar the same thing happens in the difficult times if you see the thing from a distance from Bria you will see a shadow but when you see God and you are certain years the Lord flapping his wings all of a certain time seems to be dark all of a sudden it seems we don't want this is being born in this message caliber hey hey [Music] all of a sudden the Dell wants to get us away and the picture looks dark looks complicated looks like there is an angel of the Lord I believe you'll see Jesus I am with you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] look I was going to speak more on the way but only God knows he changes things the Widow just like Abraham was required or demanded to give everything they had and put it on the altar of sacrifice a little she had put it on the altar of sacrifice his son he was going to sacrifice the messenger says was picking up the fireworks I was attacked with the Lord Jesus Christ carrying his own sacrificial for his own sacrifice if there's a little bit of unbelief if you feel you're getting cold God bless you [Applause] [Music] are brothers foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah no more
