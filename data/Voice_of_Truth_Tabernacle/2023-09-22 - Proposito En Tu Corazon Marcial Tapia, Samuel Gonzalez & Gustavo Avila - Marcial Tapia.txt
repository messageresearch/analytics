understanding science in such as her ability in them to stand in the king's Palace in whom they might teach and learning and the tongue of the children verse 8 is but Daniel purpose in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat nor would the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself Brothers um by Your Word your Holy Spirit but uh in a man [Music] because in this time how hard it is for the Youth so it hurts Daniel that takes courage God is a gentleman to choose and the truth is sometimes we don't care what the word says it says that's the truth is foreign in English to not defile themselves that's true Brothers what defines a young man is his word and you stick to that is there it is look I'm gonna read this message the scripture on the wall this is not to defy ourselves you forget about that promise because truly um this is the truth the word of God it's that simple see that's right when I go through trials I have so many words so much words and if I do it to the side it's worthless it doesn't help me Dios is outside the word of God yes the devil takes advantage and he does with us how he pleases because we don't stay with his word simple message Brothers I won't Shout pero namas more the love of God is you're worth more than this is for brothers diados it won't be shaken up

stump anywhere it was corrected upon your feelings that's right but when I walk back on the word of God is [Music] amen Brothers if we stay in his word remember anything for you tonight it just my soul needs that's good and glory to God because by the time I was run out my brother please pass God bless you amen God bless you Brothers man God bless our brother Marshall please stand up and if you please open your Bibles to first to John chapter 2 verse 15. those you have it please say Amen love not the world neither the things that are in the world any man love the world the love of the father is not in him verse 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lusts of the eyes and the pride of the life is not of the father what is of the world Amen you may take your seats brothers and diving into the word Brothers talked about this last week so we can see in Daniel chapter one The Kingdom of Israel was taken over and conquered by Babylon poor Babylonia under the rule of King nebuchadnezzarena Daniel chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 says Daniel Capitol in the third year of the reign of Jehovah Kim King of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it is verse 2 and the lord gave Jehovah king of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God yes which she carried into the land of shinar to the house of his God and he brought the vessels into the Treasure House of his God already that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's seeds principles after conquering Israel you see the Bible says that he also took treasures and captives back to the kingdom of Babylon you see in the Bible shows was captured and taken to Babylonia along with others including the three Hebrew men you see but they weren't taken as prisoners he was looking for young men and understanding science and such has had ability and then to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learnings and the tongues of the Sheldon that they would be easier to influence mama Holiness this world wants to influence us this world wants to pressure us and squeeze us into this movie and to this lifestyle you see it's easy for the Youth to be influenced it's easy for us young people to be influence and if I could be honest tonight we are being influenced by the world and we don't see it you see we could be influenced by friends call me to church and making it a religions you see the devil is not playing around you see the devil is waiting waiting to devour us and he's trying to influence you see we don't see this our phones can influence us sometimes you see sometimes youth areas we spend most of our day we did most of our day to our phones to our daily routine when I say this for me too because this has happened to me there are days where I gave most of my days TV television and all this routine and we can't even give God five minutes of our days spend time with him you see it's sad Brothers sad but it's true but when we lose our foreign you see we are on the verge of spiritual death each day it's fine that we are dying spiritually we are slowly distancing ourselves from God you can fool me maybe you can fool me you're careful God knows what's wrong with you you can say you're fine you can say oh I don't need to come to the office you see but we we are living in times where we need to live in prayer day by day you see we aren't advancing you we are advancing we are moving backwards we don't take accountability of that the devil didn't do it and this is because each of their names centered on the true God you see no matter how hard no matter how hard King Nebuchadnezzar tried to educate obligates and influence these influences although he lived in a corrupted Place sometimes what we need in life is a commitment a commitment with God this is not enough Brothers but Brothers we think that we have all you see there will be times of difficulties I must do that and it will get harder to overcome and as youth it's hard this world will try its hardest to influence it's hard is to influence each and every one of us hearing receiving and acting preacher 1960. God don't like compromisers does he want his church to look like the world he doesn't want it to act like the world he doesn't want to have anything to do with them but only to preach the gospels God wants separators the church wants mixers you see this world has nothing foreign I have does it mean that God doesn't have doesn't have nothing for you it's not about God bless you [Applause] if the prophet of God said in 1977 after that he saw no light you know you'll lose we're 50 years into that you could ask yourself what type of Darkness we are in today estamos I don't know if you desperate desperately I don't know if you're awake after that I don't know after this if you're expecting God to come down here and I think that's the only way some of us are going to wake up sometimes sometimes sometimes I made the prayers when I say God reveal yourself to me in a great glorious way gloriosa but many times God is in front of us in such a simple way that we look over it time it time and time again purpose in your heart stay with me I will your purpose in my heart amen that's our desires are you purpose something and that's something that's something concrete now we'll take you through this world [Music] God's not going to lift you up and pass you over it our God is a God that has been tested by fire okay has gone through the fire and come out of it my question is do you want that guy that helps you go through the fire the fire of this world that just simply wants to burn you up consumer that's the question tonight now we're talking about Daniel and and meditating on Daniel and Daniel you know you you hear what brother Samuel says King Babylon Babylonia I was looking for a certain type of young people we already know that means the world Amen the world the devil is looking for a type of people amen if they can please put it up one more time reverse four and I got nothing of myself I'm simply an echo repeating something that's already been told to us but yeah I believe we have to be reminded by day that's why he says give us this day our daily bread amen he said children in whom was no blemish are you with me tonight and understanding science so when I look at this I see that these young men already had knowledge they had understandings but yet later on after the 10-day fast then now you know the the those God gives them wisdom he gives them three things and skills of literature so my question is how can someone no more if they already knew let's just say everything like many of us I know everything I know that I know this I know that don't tell me that Mama don't tell me I already know that's our excuse that's our answer foreign [Music] myself [Music] video Luke chapter 6 says ye love them which love you Luke chapter 6 verse 32. look at it now for if ye love them which love you what thank you what they think have he yeah for Sinners also love those that love them which do good to you what thank you come on but love your enemies and your reward ing Grace I think they had a great rewards I believe they had a great reward from God because again to obtain and know more of God you have to go what he went through the trials that this world puts on us show that great godly attribute and I believe through those 10 days these four men would put it into trials they were able to obtain such a knowledge when the King Nebuchadnezzar can notice them oh brother did you capture that that was the only way after those 10 days where they were able to be distinguished you could tell somebody foreign they're going through a hard time maybe trusting somebody for every trusting in their family but after all that a reward at the end is waiting for them I'll tell you a true reward something that this world can't give you but I believe the children of God they desire to go through the trials and come out with something more than themselves I know they betrayed your trust that you have to look at them after that this was this It could only be gone I believe that these Hebrew men oh change something Supernatural that the king himself recognizes has spent time obtain of their gods and live with their God be with your God the title is purpose in your heart it's a choice who you open up to uh yeah tonight what is your choice this is God do you want to serve because maybe you may say oh yes I I may not know my Bible yeah because they may say oh that's how you you're supposed to be okay from Genesis to Revelations well let me tell you something about my profits it says in the message The Works that I do bear witness of me he talks about a brother that came to him and told him he says well preacher you don't know the Greek words I said I don't know the Bible right can you please put it up right here again he says you don't know the Bible right if you know this word don't mean this it means that that's right this book is fine that's right this book is fine but I'd rather know s [Applause] later on it was needed for dawa cause later on we can see in chapter two a deep calling to the Deep amen oh okay if you can just imagine yourself a non-believer king Babylonia asking for something Supernatural and what about us knowing the message having the weapons and tools right in front of us and not taking advantage of that opportunity let me show you an unbelievable we can see what these four men went through the purpose that they had later on [Music] the word of God says understanding of visions and dreams amen many times we obtained things that we don't know for what I go through trials but later on this is something I'm barely capturing out here God let you be called womanizer yes a drug addict a Hypocrites nobody I don't understand why but it's not up to me maybe God has a bigger purpose for me later on there's a young man or a sister out there that may need of someone that went through that understands that has the wisdom and understanding of how it is or what it is it says right here Daniel chapter 2 verse five asking for something super nice it says the the thing is gone from me up to this point the kingdom had a bad dream that nobody could tell him he says it's gone from me this is if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof verse five he said um he says you shall be cut in pieces and your house shall be made in dunghills this world can't satisfied the Deep the Deep desires of the heart Los Angeles in chapter 10 in verse 10 sorry it says before the king and said there is not a man upon the Earth that can show the king's matter therefore there is no King Lord no ruler there is such thing as any magician or astrologer or Chaldean they themselves didn't even know there's just something odd to them this is something rare stop being Supernatural that was beyond the human ability is a master in the Supernatural he's a master in the Supernatural I've seen it in my life I've seen it in many other lives it have been fully transformed this is the Chaldean still talking and it is a rare thing that the King requireth this is and there is none other that can show it before the king accept the cards whose swelling is not with flesh oh it's because they didn't
