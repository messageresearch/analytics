Corinthians chapter 12 a privilege to be in God's house and it's a privilege to come and worship our creator how many love him this morning amen as long as he is here that's what matters that's all that matters 2 Corinthians 12 verse 2 reads in the following way 2 Corinthians 122 I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter of such in one will I Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in my infirmities let us pray Lord Jesus Christ we are thankful once again to come into your presence with the correct atmosphere the correct attitude correct desire Lord that's the way we come close to you not thinking we know everything no sir but humble needing you to teach us Lord we put ourselves in your every heart every mind looking at you in this morning we ask that you help us in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may be seated we have been speaking about the coming of the Lord PR time that I preached I preached about this is not it repeat this is not it so I want to follow up with that thought this morning the Lord has put in my heart to speak about the other side repeat the other side where are we headed to the other side this world is not our home this is not what we're expecting I believe one of the reasons that we come to church it's to come in the atmosphere where the other side is more real to us sometimes this side of Eternity seems too real but let me tell you on the other side this is not it there's another side I believe there is proof that there's another side to begin the holy spirit is the evidence for the believer that there's another world there's another land the queen of there's not a person in the world that ever come from behind the current into this light that we live in called life but what wonders where he goes when he goes beyond here have you ever wondered ask yourself what Happ happens when we leave this earth sooner or later one way or another we will leave this earth whether through death whether the transformation of our bodies whether however God decides but we will leave this worldless atmosphere and I'm going put it this way these Dimensions be speaking about Dimensions also because we want to see where someone goes when they pass away we want to see that Dimension brother brandham says but what wonders where he goes when he goes beyond here it's just the Instinct in a man to do that we all seek we want to know what's beyond the curtain we're searching for that sooner or later at some time in our lives we are conscious one day we will leave this earth the devil wants to keep us entertained in this life so that we don't think on the one that's coming but times come it could have been when we were on our death bed it could have been when someone else passed away but many times I believe it happens when we have a tough great loss when we have a tough loss we ask ourselves is this everything what happens after this when there's a great loss I don't know if this happens to you you begin to not want to be here I don't know if that's happened to any of you but when you don't find flavor when you used to think that would be the greatest here all of a sudden you lose it all of a sudden it's outside of your reach there's a feeling that drowns you and tells you I don't want to be here anymore what's the point of being here Brothers when you've lost everything let's put it like this when you've lost the greatest thing in your life has someone lost a son a daughter father a mother a great loved person very loved by them brother Brom when he lost his daughter and his wife he didn't want to be here said Lord take me also what's the purpose of being here and this not only happens when we lose a loved one but this also happens when we lose hope in this Earth as it happen to you see your life around you see your circumstance and you say is this everything I have not another desire to be in this place come on Church sooner or later I believe God's son needs to come to the point where the things of this world precious to him they have no value I believe God tests his children in such a way where they're willing to let go of everything just like he did with AB your family your Homeland then he said leave your son ishma and then he tells give me your son Isaac God wanted to make sure loved the God's business more than the things of this Earth and God takes us to a place in our lives of this world have no value may God take us to that place we fight for temporary things we fight we get angry we effort ourselves for things that aren't going to When God says when we should fix our sides on the things from up above sooner later if you're a Son of God you want to see the other side what's the use in speaking of him what's the use of me to preach and sing about him not only do I want to prach Brothers not only do I want to preach about heaven and Eternity let me tell you I want to make it there I want to make it there there's no use in anything else we strive for we fight over this and that what's the use of all of that if we don't make it what's the use brother fight over so many things all that matter is I want to know the other side I want to know waiting for me on the other side it doesn't hurt to leave this world doesn't hurt when I cross the other side there nothing stopping me nothing telling me to stay here that it be so great my desire to be on the other side may it simply be joyful yeah I want to make it there you get I want to make it there you know I believe we need to understand the other side is real times God will break or heart brother brandom says God will break your heart and you need to love him so much that you trust and believe in him even though he breaks your heart because he will not give you everything in this life I want you to understand that God's not going to give you everything in this life he will give you everything just not in this life so I see a man here named Paul he says I Know a Man in Christ we believe he's speaking of himself but maybe he's speaking about something similar to what brother brandom saw maybe he saw his own theop maybe he succeeded to see himself in a different dimension did you know that you are also in another dimension your theophany your body is in another dimension so it says I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago caught up into the third heaven the first thing I like about this verse is that he says this happened 14 years ago and I asked myself what an impact was this for Paul after 14 years having this experience he was so impact acted it was so strong in his heart still and I see the parallel with brother Bram he went beyond the current of time he said since then I cannot be the same and I tell you church if we can taste a little of what's on the other side if God can show us if God could open our eyes a little more I believe he can do it he can open the mind of our spirit the mind of our heart I believe he can give us a taste a little a little from the other side so when a year goes by and another year goes by and another and 10 years 14 still something in our heart know that that is real that we can never be the same that's what we desire believe that's what the Holy Ghost is went beyond the curtain of time and when sister when sister hope went she said she tells this is the holy spirit this is the holy spirit don't you realize what the holy spirit is peace of Eternity oh Hallelujah peace of Eternity when you accomplish to come in the Holy Spirit a piece of eternity when God's atmosphere descends you know you're in another place the Bible says we're in Heavenly places seated with Christ Jesus die can come into Heavenly places can only be in the right atmosphere says 14 years ago such and one caught up to the third heaven verse four says how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter brother Bram ask a question and the message questions and answers prach June 28th 1959 yes in 2 Corinthians 12:3 Paul said he knew a man that was caught up into the third heaven forgive me the question was is there more than one Heaven question and he said yes in second iians 123 Paul said he knew a man that was caught up into the third heaven and over in Revelation and so forth there's more than that repeat there's more than three now when we speak of Heavens brother Bram in another message types it as atmospheres di or Dimensions di Dimensions now we presently live in three dimensions to what we can taste or try or feel the dimension of space the dimension of matter and the dimension of time all of those affect us you know it's matter because not floating you know if they hit you you feel something that's matter you know you're being affected by time because every every day we age every day we lose hair every day we get a new wrinkle every day we feel new symptoms so you know you're being affected by time so if we can see space matter and time we see we're affected by all of them but they're not the only Dimensions affecting we're the only ones we have access to but we'll see brother Bram mentions seven dimensions the fourth dimension is the dimension and science where the spirits are where the demons are where the television where the radio is Wii the internet you don't see it between us a lot of information going through your devices have access to that they can obtain information and process it but you and I can't see it right right and the same at there's the spirits the demons where the our thoughts affect our mind sometimes we think all of our thoughts are ours but many of our thoughts are anointed or sent by from Hell there are demons that get swn in our mind but I don't want to speak too much on that maybe the next time now The Fifth Dimension are the ones that died and are lost because they didn't die in Christ and Christ means you died in Christ you went into him not that you only believed in him but that you were in him you were part of him and then the sixth Dimension so one I want to focus on are the ones that have died in Christ brother Bram says in the patmas vision speaking about John and also on Paul he says God transmitted him I don't believe he was took like Paul now open to the third heaven and things or like the precious Holy Spirit did a few years ago here a few weeks ago let me see in other words I was afraid of death and the Holy Spirit taken me over and showed me what it was I want you to begin to see this brother because brother brandham says there has been three Exodus how many remember the first Exodus it's in the book of Exodus delivering Israel from Egypt delivering them and placing them putting them in the promised land the Jordan a type of death are you with me brother now the second Exodus was when the Lord Jesus Christ came and delivered the Jews delivered them from their Jewish tradition and law and then he put him through the Apostle PA because Brown says P fire came in every Exodus then he put them in Grace brother says in this time in this time the third is bringing us out of denominations and putting you in and in one situation he says and lifting them because the promised land is a type of Heaven it's a type of Eternity maybe it's not a perfect type it's a type of the Holy Spirit yes says that in many occasion but he also speaks about lifting us and I'll be reading a few of those things but brother Bram says this and notice God took Joshua before he took the people of Israel to the promised land God sent Joshua and Caleb and others to go spy the land are you with me do you remember that story I don't have to return numers and the rest and Joshua was chosen by God because he went to the prom showed him the Promised Land he saw the gra he saw the he saw the on the other side of he returned and when he returned he tells the people the land is good is don't fear everything is well on the other side brother Bram says I was afraid of death that's what the prophet says he said I was afraid of death and the Holy Spirit taken me over and showed me what it was aren't you thankful to God in this time a man to the other side to show what was and tell us the land is real God is real what he has said is the truth preached is not in vain what I believe is real let's give thanks to God he showed me you've heard the testimony then when I came back then death where is your stinger transmitted to see what was just beyond the curtain he let me come back to tell you that Beyond there we're not Spooks and Spirits listen what the prophet is saying he let me come back to tell you that Beyond there we're not Spooks and God wanted him to tell us God wanted you to know this would benefit me to tell you we're not Spooks and Spirits We're Men Women young never die never get sick just beyond the veil death can do no more to you and pull you right into that place hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah death is the portal death is the gates come out of this Dimension come into the other [Applause] dimension now John was transmitted from the ow of in the spirit over into the Lord's Day is the day of man men are fighting but the day of the Lord will come when these kingdoms will become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ then there will be the great Millennium the Lord's Day the day of his coming his judgment that will be the Lord's day this is the day of that's the reason they slam you around and do what they want to do but there will be a time call you they call you now Holy Roller and fanatic there be a Time come they won't do that they'll scream they'll whale fall at your feet the Bible said in Malachi 4 you say we do you believe it you he says even walk out on the ashes after they're burned up leave them neither root nor Branch exactly what the Bible says the righteous shall walk up upon the ashes of the wicked that's exactly they not leave nor root nor Branch nothing to come back to and they'll be done aren't you happy to know for God's children is not so God's children will come back I'm not sure if you don't believe it it's children will come back the prophet what the Bible says or you don't want to be one of them come on church this Earth was made for us I know I'm jumping ahead a little because I want to speak of the sixth Dimension but I want you to understand the prophet went beyond the other side to tell us we're not SP Spirit we're not SPS we're not there without doing anything there was a purpose they were hugging huju they weren't just laying around sleeping around there was activity brother BR says and we will come back and even steps on the ashes what ashes the ashes that were left on this Earth it's so real this is man's day that's why there's so much evil so much sin and sickness cancer wickedness but the Lord's day is coming the Lord's day is coming and it will be a different world a different planet a different reality brandom says the message Fellowship by Redemption here is what happens then if you die now according to the word of God you go out of the existence of people who can see you into his presence and there you live you can look back you're not in the world no more you're in another world and then what do you do you're like those Souls under the altar saying Lord how long will it be see you'll never be an angel you wasn't made an angel you were made men and women so you're longing to come back because you can see then when you get up here and say well I see what it's all about I know why I had to die I know why that taken place oh hallelujah hallelujah maybe we don't understand it we understand why so many evil things have to happen we don't understand why so much pain has to happen but let me tell you on the other side brhom says you can look back you can look back now I understand Lord now I understand what I did my mind will be clear my thoughts will be different thoughts let me tell you no wonder Paul said I heard words possible to utter here GL to the name of the Lord it's something this world wouldn't understand something this mind couldn't understand understand God's things but one day I'll receive a new mind new thoughts hallelu and we'll look back we'll say Lord you were right I complained I complain I cried right Lord Brother brandom repeats we weren't made to be Angels Spirits we were made to be men men and women God has made us God made us that way for but brother brandham says you never die Jesus said he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life you can't die you can't die you die to the Mortal part but you're alive here your spirit's right here with Christ then you say Lord how long is it because you wasn't made to be there you wasn't made that because you're a human being and you're longing to come back into this body perfect again we'll speak more on that later and he said just a little while longer now I know brother Bram later clarifies this is speaking about the Jews also this uh but I believe there's scripture that to every Mortal in other words we can learn from this for us he said just a little while longer until your fellow servants has suffered like the martyrs did back there then you will return comaling down how tremendous plenty to learn only here after you go out of this body out of the light and petroleum and what you're made up of you go into the fourth di out of that into The Fifth Dimension then the sixth Dimension then God is in the seventh Dimension you're right under his altar God is in the seventh we're right below that in the six when we then when God lets your spirit loose it picks up what comes out of the sixth Dimension to the fifth come out of the light into petroleum out of petroleum into the the senses and here you are back on Earth again a brand new person not old and broke down never to be sick your hair will never turn you'll never be wrinkled you'll never separate no more you'll never die you never be hungry never have a worry Walk With Your Love shake your hands and eat drink build housesit live and forever in the presence of the Lord that's what you got this morning because you heard the word of God Brothers let me tell you one more time this is just the preparation before the other side I was watching all the preparations done for the my birthday party on Friday and I say wow so much preparation was needed for three hours just for three hours and sometimes with think about this life and wonder why do we need so prepation this life is only a preparation we will be on the other side don't be AF don't worry I know it looks like it's a lot we're headed to Eternity an eternity where we will work for God do something for God there at least a thousand years so we need preparation I need preparation if you're not preparing you have nothing to prepare for but I want to prepare I want to know there's another I need to be Lord you need more need more fath I need to grow need to reflect beat me more I am your [Music] reflection message confirmation and evidence so they came out of up out of Egypt and they came to a place called Kadesh Barne I believe it was a there that Joshua great warrior among them went over to spy out the land he crossed Jordan and went over to the other land I like that the other land and came back with the evidence that the land was good that God's word was perfect his promises was true and he had the evidence that the land was there he had hold of something the land was exactly what God promised to can you imagine Joshua and Caleb so many years in bondage and the prophet Moses arrives and he tells them God is going to take us to another land God has a different place for us I imagine he C to I imagine they said if Moses said it I believe it the prophet said it I believe it I believe it hallelujah hallelujah I believe what he preached I believe what he said brother says and Joshua to that but he didn't know so he went to the other side and he had the evidence the confirmation that the land was there he had held to something or could hold on to something let's hold on to that this life is pointless without it but it makes all the sense if we hold on to that now I understand why we must go through because there's something greater waiting over there he had hold of something that the land was exactly that God promised two men was packing a bunch of grapes hallelu Hallelujah the grapes represent wine where they make wine and wine represents Revelation and God allowed in this time not just take the prophet beyond the current of time or he lifted him with seven angels to Heavenly places he gave him Bunches of Grace gave him the word the Revelation the people could taste of it oh hallelujah hallelujah the people could taste you notice we're not t a pcal holy ghost or a Wesley and Holy Ghost we're tasting the holy spirit with the Revelation with the Revelation pure word of God for our Hallelujah they're not old graes fresh graes that God given us in this time and there we receive our Holy Spirit that's where we receive it the fresh word of the hour it was a confirmation that God had kept his then Israel crossed the Jordan and went to the promis land and Joshua divided up the land for they were in peace they Nation they had their churches they planted their CS they raised their children they took them to church and they lived happy and God put fear in all the na other nations of them and they were great people going to jump ahead paragraph 36 then one day come to the paragraph 37 but he come to his cish barnea the Judgment SE was KES Bara the Judgment seat was KES bar and he came to Kish where upon Him bore he bore the sins of the world but he crossed also the Jordan that we call the Jordan of death he went over into the other land and was dead for three days and three nights he died Till The Sun quit shining oh Lord he died till the Earth had a nervous breakdown it shook the rocks out of the mountains he died and on the third day he rose back again with the evidence that there is a land where a man can live and not die he returned back from that land there is life after deathu Hallelujah Jesus Christ showed us that there's life after death we shouldn't have a doubt we shouldn't doubt it in question life after death now he says to his disciples I'm going to give you the earnest of this I'm going to give you the confirmation as they did to Abraham with circumcision but wait up there at Jerusalem until you have got the confirmation until you have the evidence and they waited on the 10th day there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind that filled all the building where they were sitting and they were all filled with the Holy Tong of fire sat upon them the musicians can come tongues of fire sat upon them and they were all filled and began to speak with other languages as the spirit gave them utterance what was it it was the evidence that our Joshua Jehovah savior had returned from the dead and given us an evidence that when we die we live again on the other side confirmation confirming giving the evidence of it let us all stand did say Leon random the brandom [Music] says 3 then one day down come the great Chief Captain the Lord Jesus and he began to tell them of another land he said in my father's house is many mansions if it was not so I would have told [Music] you and I'll go and prepare a place for you and come again to receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also in other words like this you have been loyal to the cause but you have to die but there's a land that man lives and don't die there is life after [Music] death what a promise to the people it was astounding and astonish [Music] many the holy [Music] spirit this time is our [Music] evidence is our Piece of [Music] Heaven is our deposit or down payment it's God telling you if here in my presence can have peace can have joy can feel loved this is only a little of what you will feel over [Music] there if you don't have the Holy Spirit it's time that you have it that is your down payment that is your evidence that's your confirmation let me tell you we need a little bit of I'm honest I'm honest I need a little bit of confir I knew the people needed a little bit of evence God knew they needed that strive a little more so the devil didn't take him out of the way God knew the Propet need that evidence he said he felt tired he said he felt afraid he said he felt [Music] doubting but he says after that I need to strive and I'll be honest I need a little of that evidence I need his love his holy spirit sink my heart that it remind me that it remind me why I'm fighting why I'm leaving this world behind why am I leaving leav the letting go of the things I say I love because there's something greater because all that is good is waiting for me there [Music] ohren brother brandom was [Music] told no one else than with Divine love can come in here and he says this [Music] I would trade every gift every gift if God offered me Divine love in a second I would trade [Music] them to obtain Divine love because I know Divine love is the way I'm getting in there that nothing else
