this morning maybe see it for a moment [Music] to know we have a people coming with the expectation on behalf of God Amen [Music] first of all I want to thank our brother Titus foreign for your fine attentions uh one of my members might stay behind how well you treat us but if they stay behind they stay in good hands soy content of the election I'm very happy that great a number of the church could be here to know that this place is small but Iglesia local for the number of the local church [Music] not only that but locally we have understood that you have two Services due to space [Music] and we thank the local church members to give us space to be here in this morning thank you very much when I think on what a service or church is is a rejoicing this is the messenger says that we were made to worship Him and that's every one of ours of us our duty when we come to church even if you don't like the song leader so you're in your duty to worship God Amen if they can replace you with a mannequin then it's serious amen amen imagine singing to God and the song says I lift up my hands and your hands back there in your pockets you're not living while you're singing you know when you surrender there's something that happens this is not a scolding this is a commercial to answer into what's coming yeah her inner feelings or delicate the word the bride says Amen to the words so let's recognize who we are I'm remembering the black man that was brought from his land a slave Cristiano brother Brandon types that man in the life of a Christian he knew who he was brother you don't know the problems I had in the morning even my wife beat me with the pan important it doesn't matter but when you two come to church you come to worship this is the way I worshiped worship before you can Brothers well you're gonna look strange in heaven it's a natural is the type of the spiritual yesterday we were in the park and we were rejoicing meeting each other but there was also another flock of ducks there was no way to silence they were also in a fellowship yes or yes [Applause] and the next service amen I'm a mannequin or am I a worshiper you come to a restaurant chips and they bring you chips and salsa when you come to the restaurant that's just to begin with until the meal arrives but sometimes the sauce is spicy the salsa is spicy so we thank God that he brought us safely to see our friends the last time he interpreted me and I said I feel sorry for him he's gonna have to go again pray for him a Bueno let's please stand hello Internet so the brother watching on the internet my name is pastor of Jerusalem Tabernacle we come from Tucson a buenos I come accompanying 25 people yeah brother last time you came you came with brother Montoya right I told them no he came with me not I with him it's something we wanted to do a long time ago and for certain reasons we couldn't and the church would always remind me when are we going to Colorado and this last camp in Phoenix Tabernacle my son Isaac is by the person he is he when he returned he told me um my friends from Colorado yes and they also tell us and when are you coming and I said what's promised is dead we told them we would be here and we're here now he but if God gives us more lives let's hope God allows us to be back Romans chapter 8 verse one and then we'll read verse 6. I hope you can be patient with me Romans 8 1 then verse 6. this is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit is minded as death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace let us pray kind Heavenly Jesus I ask you to call me Lord I can express the picture in my mind and May your children be helped please be with us in the name of Jesus we ask amen amen you may be seated if we could title our message we will title it being the image of Christ look I might not finish without certainly certainty I might not finish but knowing we were on our way here and we were threatened uh with the possibility of being in the program in the service you know you prepare if you need a song leaderman brother in Tucson that says let's untune this song or he needs to preach into his um so I began to ask the church is there a certain thought they want to know about no no no no no there wasn't a clear answer is specifically and I didn't have a specific message to speak this morning but Lord we are here I just don't want to get up here and yeah entertain the people that's not my job my job is to preach the gospel on Friday after my son was done testifying a scripture come to me and now I had something foreign and I said well I got something now there's something when the fellowship almost ended last night I came to my brother Josue and when I got close to him the title came to me it was a title that he used in one of his preachings and I said here it is may God forgive you they're there for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now we'll see scripturally what the spirit is the people say it's the holy ghosts because our message is being the image of Christ amen amen and for success for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now let's turn to Revelation chapter 3 verse 22 it is I hope you're looking for Revelation it's the last book I hope you're not in Genesis there's people that say where's matthew New or Old Testament and I say well I at least it doesn't say Matthew's in Tucson foreign let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches okay so when we see the scripture we find out that occupying the spirit is occupying the words because here is saying who happen here let him hear what the spirit says so the spirit speaks the way we think is by the spirit because but he just didn't do things the way we sometimes do things first he thought it is that's what he was doing in eternity before he brought in Adam thinking about everything he would bring thinking about you your eyes everything you are hello he was thinking about it how ungrateful are he's spent an eternity thinking about every leaf of every tree the colors supposedly well all trees are green in in the spring but not all have the same green darker green or light green God was thinking about us every vein that's in the leaves God was thinking about God is a god of details he was thinking about you and your characteristics even what you would go through and how he would watch for you everything God planned everything important and he said I'm going to send the most important so when we see here it foreign Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now to be image of Christ is image of the word your motto should be the word seriously yesterday look when you begin coming to church you say I want to be like the brothers to start it's fine to be like but if you knew what the brother did when no one sees him foreign and your Pokemon is I can make mistakes not that I can I do them there's someone that says brother we're not perfect well depending what Perfection we're talking about seriously yesterday because if the Perfection is for no one to make mistakes then no one will be perfect the Perfection the Bible speaks it's for you to believe the word and live it yes yes the Bible says they hope that job was perfect and righteous before God but not before men this is yeah you made this in this mistake why was he perfect because he always said the word and God as his modeling example but without a doubt I was single no no no no I wasn't single I was already married and they invited me to preaching California Garcia so I went with Greg Garcia yeah they invited me to preach and he said wait boys I'll make a program and I'll let you know okay so I stay still and no one told me anything else and later the brothers were expecting me over there to preach and I didn't go nobody told me anything so um they were complaining to me and I exposed to them the situation and I told my pastor told me to wait until he gave me instructions and while the brothers were there waiting for me and I told him why were you waiting for me if the pastor never told me so I went to speakers and to top it off he told me hey weren't you supposed to be in California preaching and I told him you told me to wait for your indication and he told me oh that was true he said now I realize that I'm my God you'll see and I said oh really not only do I forgive but I forget yes no extra now if you're in the group of the ones that are crazy yes that little group of people that believe in the message and believe in a messenger and a prophet is now let's search what the messenger says because the prophet messenger gives the instructions and now we find a group of interpreters that he did not mean to say this what he really meant to say or what he meant to say was what he said yes or yes now you remember the story of that of that cousin or when the owner of the of the property came of the ranch that was looking for a bride it is they even had boots and pistols and the man that was looking there said no I see this in Chicago I'm looking for something different he said he said he went out and he was searching and he saw this woman throwing water out he came close and started a conversation and in the conversation he saw that she had the characteristics of a wife and he says that she captivated him with his with her words and she was all nervous her garments were dirty because she was cleaning but in that conversation he dare tell her will you marry me is he playing with me is he joking with my mind but he was serious certain time she said he said she prepared she began to prepare herself yes and her cousins told her and look each other he didn't mean to say that the bride has a messenger received a message from Eliza what he said is [Applause] Just One More Time Lord can you allow me to read a couple quotes seriously yes or yes let me find it brother thanks to God for tech technology preached in 1963-0-120 in the evening paragraph 76 and 77 says this is how the messenger says how many of you believe the messenger but it's gonna benefit us I'm gonna tell you a quick testimony I fear needles and that's why I I don't like getting sick you just have a disease and they say that needles hurt but help the quickest brother they call me the turkey because I can take all the pills but hopefully they don't inject me uh injections hurt they they help seriously yes yes that's how the message is but it helps it says see Dios um that's how the devil is yeah and the clock is running and there's tension is that we put the preacher nervous he makes The Interpreter nervous and if he doesn't make them nervous he makes a person back here nervous yes he is is she no longer and if he can accomplish that he makes Universe nervous now you know them people over there they do that they watch this that's not your example Christ is your example he said giving you an example let him be your example yes now you say Christ is the one that was at Calvary now here's the quote this is Moses was the word in his days William yes or yes foreign we'll go to the message the world is falling to peace only the title scares you the world has fallen to pieces if it's falling apart there's no secure place but God made an exit God made a safe place God always provides a place the word amen amen the world is falling apart preach 1963. o412 is let's read paragraph 160. this is but no thought is up for you allow it to dwell in here the thoughts that were in Christ and that's the word as human beings we have good ideas but the one that's right is the word amen amen let's go to another quote they're all pointing to the word and the master is the token foreign in the morning and let's read paragraph 345 it is and the prophet says in this quote let me be a brother a brother to a brother let me be an example of examples look when I mentioned Christ automatically because Christ and the world are two no no okay I'm in the wrong church then Christ in the world or how many res now often we can change what the word says right so instead of twice we can say the word I began to play with your mind now this is he it says I'm gonna switch it here a little bit me because the word of God and Christ are one seriously yes or yes let me be a minister to the ministers foreign what does the devil think about us maybe he has wrong information seriously yes or yes schools no brother look I want to motivate your face you have a model and that's the word but see what happens when they give the wrong information says that Peter was telling John okay and Peter told him everything that Paul did Juan is John heard all that and he nourished of everything that Peter said about Paul is and it happened that John's uh he had a flat tire by Paul's house and he remembered that Paul lived in the neighborhood find out if he has a jack because I need one and as he was going he was remembering all the erroneous things that Peter told him about Paul and he thought about himself says when he showed up knocked on the door Paul opens the door and when Paul sees him he says I'm glad to see you and John was reasoning everything Peter told him and that he said if you want don't even borrow your jack absence sometimes they give you wrong information about the brothers be the word let's continue here let me show to the world that this word is Christ is and the only way I can do it is coming to him because I can't do it myself you can do it and you become one and then it lives itself out you are in Walking episode of Jesus Christ when he has got complete control control of you to make every word may that be may this be our objective what does brother Branham say COC yes or yes what does the Bible say when the preacher comes up you're following him the teachers the evangelists you are judging them by the words if they're in the word what they're preaching seriously yes but you don't judge the messengers you take what he said and say Amen so we need to be involved so much in the world to how many of you has it ever happened and because his movie begins to tell a story that brother Brandon relates and then the nerves changed the lower paper wasn't his intention and you say in your mind no it he didn't say like this he said it this way seriously yes or yes you know nervousness is betraying the brothers you're trying to see where he's leading you or what's his point but you're so informed in the world that you already know the story COC yesterday no you already know no it's not like that I myself when I see my own videos I say I has this I missed it right seriously yes and when I say the truth I say Amen there's tremendous to preach no one like him you gotta think that you're the best and cheer yourself or do the youth not stand in the mirror and then they jump to east side and then and in their mind others no one like me seriously yes sir yes and I would look at myself in the mirror and in my mind you're driving crazy in the desert Ed that's how you need a thinking Christian Life the same thing I believe the message and I live for it seriously yes or yes yes or yes it's part of let you in the world be one and then it'll live itself out Jesus Christ you are a walking episode of Jesus Christ when he has got complete control control over you to make every word let's read now in questions and answers Hallelujah sessions this was preached 1964 August 23rd por la Manana in the morning we'll read in paragraph the ocean see give me a second brother I'll go okay it's foreign it's a same message by evening message 1964. and the messenger says you know questions and answers now being a theologian being trained nothing came with that sermons nothing had to do with that what made him different foreign the same thing as repeating in other words if the word comes to dwelling we are the word of the day seriously yes or yes it says that is the evidence of the Holy ghosts when God reveals it to you you stay lobe and you see it does say the Lord and you accept it yes not where you are respect or what you were it but it's what God has done for you Aura now is there is the evidence tremendous tremendous right Lord Jesus may God help us you know why we're here because we want to come close to God we want to please God you want to be right with God the evil I do find out it's in me not wanting to do it I desire to do good seriously yes or yes but I'm going to tell you this before and I was accompanying brother Jr he was doing some work and supposedly I was helping him and when we finished we were in the parking area there was some Vehicles there is and has it happened to you that you can use your peripheral vision as it happened to you right and then as I was walking foreign don't say Sir um I saw this person coming close and I perceived that they were gonna come out to meet me so I was spraining so fast and what I thought that's what happened in between the vehicles and I was watching him and when he arrives there was a reaction I right away and someone comes to bother you is and all of a sudden the lion comes out the real me that's why we come to church may God help us may we be original yes or yes amen amen to not worship just because the other one is worshiping himself because someone else shouted amen amen don't be no one else's Echo if you're going to be an echo yeah be the echo of the message say what the message says amen amen I want to read in the message birth pain just uh uh title or the word pain is preached 1965 or 124. is paragraph 168 [Music] he doesn't realize the eyes of the Lioness are watching him sisters to see what those messages says we're going to balance and align him right now Excuse me yes sir yes [Applause] someone around here and who told the preacher that the word cleanse us help us but let's give space to the word I mean let's give thanks to the world this last quote and my time has ended Hallelujah a Luz a la Iglesia Novia palabra the word must deliver the word bride Church yes or yes if the word is gonna deliver or give birth can you imagine an elephant giving birth to a chicken Common Sense tells you another elephant will be born yes or yes foreign amen Kevin is the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for Christ remember we give thanks to God for every open Church yes or yes but we must recognize if we could reach someone through these means foreign algeron Como subiendo de suspies like that forgive me them that fell asleep and all the ages will make up that bright that come out on the word that that they come out on like from your feet coming to your head she gets greater and more you have to have as the body grows up so does the body of Christ grow up amen amen one unites and the other United States and the one that believes all the words and he says oh they even say things about you right to be bride you don't need to know so much it's good that you're just like the other one that is congregating that doesn't believe anything yesterday because every church has three types of Believers so there's three fellowships that we have to believe every amen we believe it we believe the
