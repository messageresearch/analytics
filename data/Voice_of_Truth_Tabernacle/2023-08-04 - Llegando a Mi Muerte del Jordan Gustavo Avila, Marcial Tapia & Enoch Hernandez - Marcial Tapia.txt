you believe that tonight [Music] come on now foreign [Music] presence Simon yes Lord yes [Music] preach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with such a group of people like you going on uh show love patience determination determination even when they don't feel like it right there's just something about a son and daughter of God sometimes they just can't control things they just simply have to pour it out it's truly again a privilege to be amongst you okay I see loving faces I just have shown me love and mercy time and time again hey man if you can open up to Second Kings that's going to be where we bring our main subject tonight with our beloved Brothers [Music] and the reads like this and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha with from gilgales and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thou thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethelise can we say a Christian Life Christiana it's not a mediocre like it's not a normal life a lot from you but it also gives you a lot back our God is not a God that owes anybody and tonight we're going to see a life that is worthy to live up to okay to live up to amen I I let us go to the author of the word now beloved father padre and holy spirit yes all in one God we never deserve you but yet you chose to be part of our Lives I don't understand it maybe in my whole life we never will but it's not up to me to understand it's me to Simply believe simply believe what you did for me what you're still doing and what are you gonna do tonight take this vessel as well as the other two and take this church this people is that they don't come from because if they did then they're living disappointed I believe they came for for you because they I believe they prayed having a need to hear the answer of that needs we ask you to make yourself presents in your holy name I pray Jesus Christ amen you may be seated the title if we can put one tonight is getting to my Jordan death yes okay can you say it with me getting two by Jordan yeah I mean I believe that we all have to get to that Jordan there in order to God to fully take control of us reading and studying the chapter two of Second Kings we know the the story that's going on where Elijah is about to leave and tonight my goalie it's just to show you the everything that Elisha went through is his encounter there's this one quintro where his life completely changed fully around I'm going to share a couple key notes where Elijah knew that Elijah donde Elias had something different to offer then and Elijah knew he had a purpose to fulfill but he didn't know what exactly that was something we know that we've all we're all told we have a purpose young people young ladies young men we're told that every single day many times we have the question you know his purpose through everything but it had to be him also wanting to mean letting God show him Elijah wasn't scared to face the unknown Elizabeth because he was about to enter into a chapter of life where his mentoring we can say a father figure um not knowing what to do maybe we're all going to get there one day we're going to be our mom and dad not knowing what to do tonight with this is hopefully you can find out what we need is when that time comes Elijah goes into the unknown confidence [Music] foreign foreign [Music] it's truly me Is We I have an appointment right here right now with God I don't know what's going to happen but I ain't gonna leave the saying I'm Gonna Leave determined with something new and something different in my life amen all right amen all right wake you up a little bit but he says in the message the second hand rope he says but notice here they come out and Elijah when he came by yeah his time just about fulfilled for him to come by where he was at he said now you stay here I'm going I'm going to go up to gilgal up here now brother bam says this you see he tried to discourage him many times in our lives we're going to have loved ones that maybe not intentionally no intentional but they try they discourage us sometimes you know it's going to happen and many times when there's a blessing laying right ahead says the devil tries everything he can to discourage us we go through trials and tests and brother Brandon gives us a key right here being spiritually minded spiritual he knew that he had a purpose and he wasn't going to leave him he said as the Lord liveth in your soul living I'm not going to leave he said brother Brown says I like that this is one of these Americans I like that determination and while reading this God gave me this angle God will let you settle yours I'm going to say God will let you settled you hear that there's a gentleman [Music] he's not going to force you he's gonna Force he's gonna let you be go your past whatever you want but I love how brother Brandon brings it in this angle brother Brandon preaches this message a second rope twice and he preaches this one and I believe in uh Phoenix and then one in Jeffersonville you stay be here and settle down and be a good teacher of Theology and so forth he said how tremendous is God gives us the opportunity we all have the opportunity to continue your life with them or without him it's our own choice like I said one day we're going to be out with Mommy and Daddy and we're gonna have to make a choice [Music] but knowing that God is truly by itself foreign [Music] eyes to flow through us for someone else that's what he likes want it for you like shock he wanted that life foreign is that what living is because again many people have professional lives professional you know there's nothing wrong with that you know they have great careers they're well known if you can say but being in the barbershop that you get to talk to people and I ask them what do you do for a living this is oh wow that's a great life that's a great career oh I'm gonna go home sit on my couch and turn on my TV television all day yeah all day I've worked hard I feel like I've done enough I don't want that type of life foreign not perfect again it was not only one [Music] many times the devil asks us that a Revival service what are you gonna do Elijah didn't know everything exactly how it was gonna go Elise but inside of him I believe there's something about the genes of children of God you can't explain it but there's just a piece there's just a piece that tells you it's okay it's all right relax because I believe foreign that's all he wants for you man time zones if I can to leave you with this I'm gonna maybe switch a little bit I heard this is from a preaching of uh of this Minister the ministry it's called Divine confidence and many times I feel like we some need of that yeah to be able to be confident where we're standing even though they may point fingers and say his life maybe he's not living up to the life of the word there's no no no no no no no but I'm going to read you this real quick the devil what he wants to do is get you in a place where you're struggling and he could convince you yeah that you're in a place that you're not okay do you get that yeah because that's the that's the whole job of the devil to try to stir you up and maybe implant some doubts [Music] make you questions all he cares about is that you believe that the word of God is applicable yesterday if the word of God is applicable manana but it's never applicable today because once he knows that you can believe that the word of God is applicable to you today then he knows he has no power he has no power because then what you say like Elijah said let the god of Elijah show himself I I say this let the god of William Branham show himself tonight because I know what can you say and I believe that the word of God is the same yesterday today is applicable to me to my life [Applause] Hermanos is Bueno Gloria Dios is a pleasure are you glad to be here how many youth came this way can you lift your hands because my message is foreign [Music] amen amen and as a subtitled I'd like to place he kept his eyes it's important brother it's important that you don't lose your focus so have your eyes to the pastor all the time because we know God is with our pastors we must face the circumstances by ourselves because we will find ourselves at some point in our lives we must cry out sir watch brother Holiness youth Amen brother now [Music] the Wonders foreign [Music] foreign Corazon [Music] now what did he do Alias he's told Elijah Elijah give me one second I just want to dismiss myself from my family and what else did he do what did he do matoros how many times we think okay our dreams mucho we worry a lot even us as ministers when we see there's a need somewhere we always think about the money and how many days do I need to stop working it's two thousand dollars but I'm not gonna earn them brethren [Music] you aren't the only ones how many are suffering struggling one way foreign that's what God sent us foreign okay Gloria dios Lord of God so Elisha got rid of everything if he did it that we can do it also if he started everything he was going to let go of iMac and nevertheless then we can do it also foreign [Music] all of that happiest person the happiest questions oh brother with us Glory hallelujah hallelujah brother he kept his eyes on Elijah and now where do we keep we grab our iPhone or any cell phone I spent two and a half hours Jesus Christ I'm closing now is a second hand rope preached 1956. and El tayer you know God usually puts us in the shop and trims us up he didn't alter his ropes and that's what he does today he Alters foreign foreign don't be confused let's not be confused that's why we don't see God because we see ourselves what we do is and that's in our nature whenever I want someone says I can't find anything to do for people to see me hermoso hermosoes it's beautiful when we do it for love with all of our hearts and we can see God in Simplicity may God use you greatly and yes you can do it and we can do it we can't get rid of anything from Indigo God bless you [Applause] God bless you understand to read Second Kings 2 12. I don't have so much fire like these two young men what I'd like to be a little more calm this is the Manera it says the following way levio and Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes clothes and rent them in two pieces he took Apostle the manso of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan yes and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had Smith in the waters they parted hither and dither and Elijah Elisha went over says we should identify ourselves with every character from The Bible and I'd like to identify with Elisha God calls man like God called Adam in the Garden of Eden restaurant but our nature is to hide right because our sin is always upon our face is I go way back in my life when I was 20 years old I remember my father called me and said come son me who is the um the Holy Spirit has sent me to Mexico City would you like to accompany me and I was just wondering well the Holy Ghost sent you at the same time [Music] if the holy spirit is sending him that same holy spirit is sending you [Music] I left whatever I was doing [Music] um and I started to help my father in the ministry dosanos for two years then my father accompanied me to Phoenix and he leaves me under the care of brother Bernie Garcia for the Bernie G Garcia tells me something and he says Enoch Elementary I'm going to give you the same training as brother Enrique Anaya wow for me that was a very tremendous I say it as a joke but it's very true one of the very first things I did was wash dishes to sweep the house attend the elders he would make us help people repair homes and other things it wasn't as I thought it would be one time I heard her brother Garcia train brother Anaya he said I never fed Anaya food to his mouth he said I took him and he killed yes that's how it should be with every one of you use for one day for you to become a leader you must be under Authority you need to learn to obey us to learn to make mistakes you need to learn so put yourself aside I remember Garcia even brother Garcia sometimes he would send me to gather use that were in drug homes it didn't fit in my mind what am I doing here pick up a person and I would be afraid going to places like that but I was willing to do whatever he ordered me to Garcia one day brother Garcia told me Enoch I don't want robots I want people by the same Holy Spirit to tell you I want him to tell you what you should do came to my life but when my father passed on I lost my objective my goal that's why it's importante it's important that we do what Elisha did Elise Elisha never saw the man I'm watching The Man I began to remember foreign have I not given five years of my life to his ministry why does he treat me that way Christian walk is not easy and many times man Mexico esparame he said wait I will send to call you everyone knows my story seven years past he never called me but I was in that worldliness and I began to see who truly said those words the Holy Ghost through my pastor I also understood that God was calling me back to the Christian walk that's why here Elijah is in a situation his Pastor is being taken away from the scene his robe falls on the ground and there is foreign or nothing wow thank you God glory Holderman Garcia brother Garcia once said we went to Nacogdoches is and he said Can two youth accompany me yeah companion to use a company or he said to you to accompany me and I'm the youngest one of them but one of them is the other is myself are married [Music] but he said before he even thinks about it first of all has to learn to be a leader young ladies hombres young man are you following God in flesh in a man oh wow commencitors young ladies if you have feelings for a young man a young man that cannot minister to himself you are looking in the wrong place it's necessary to look for our parents advice and parents can recognize you can seek your pastor's advice because we don't know everything yeah [Music] father [Music] [Music] waiting for to make you fall medicine my brother was telling me I can't understand the use you're born in the message the world I didn't want to offend him I simply said the scripture says maybe the devil will not attack you in yourself God [Music] and that's why he said I want a double portion foreign [Music] you may stand ing says in the message second hand robe is he
