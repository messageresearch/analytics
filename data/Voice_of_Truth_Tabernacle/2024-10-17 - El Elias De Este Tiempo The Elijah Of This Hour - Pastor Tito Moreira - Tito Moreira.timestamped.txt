[24:32] and at the end of the service brother
[24:33] Felix and brother Fernando will be
[24:35] speaking a little bit since
[24:40] for I just want to focus a few minutes
[24:42] on what we've been speaking on Wednesday
[24:45] how many love the word of the Lord
[24:49] Brothers how many of you like to learn
[24:51] about this
[24:54] topic especially the church age we're
[24:56] speaking of
[24:58] because it's the church
[25:00] age the
[25:03] time speaking of the
[25:07] calendar the time which was our turn to
[25:10] live yes or
[25:12] yes the age of
[25:15] L the seventh Church age the seventh
[25:20] age that's the age you and I live
[25:24] in it belongs to
[25:27] us and we can
[25:30] identify and we can see ourselves in the
[25:34] scripture do are you interested in are
[25:37] you interested in
[25:39] KN what which Angel was for
[25:44] you which message was for
[25:47] you if God sent something for me I want
[25:54] it I'm gonna say it again if God sent
[25:56] something for me I want
[26:03] it and God sent
[26:07] it through an
[26:09] angel God sent a
[26:12] message through an angel for this age
[26:17] for this
[26:19] time God doesn't speak to the
[26:22] church God speaks to the angel of the
[26:27] church does not speak to the
[26:30] church speak to the angel of the
[26:35] church thanks God we follow the angel of
[26:37] the Church of the age of
[26:42] laa there are people without the
[26:47] message because they haven't found out
[26:50] which the what is or which is the angel
[26:52] of this age
[26:58] they base themselves on previous
[27:02] Angels or previous evangelists that have
[27:08] come but it's important to identify the
[27:11] angel of this
[27:16] age to know the message that God sent
[27:19] for
[27:20] us if you don't know the
[27:24] angel you cannot receive his message
[27:29] and God will not send the message to the
[27:32] church God has a way of
[27:39] working and the way he works is he
[27:41] chooses one man who to
[27:44] speak and this
[27:48] man takes the message to the
[27:51] church do we agree till
[27:56] now if not they will be another
[27:59] preaching another
[28:02] time and until the angel of the Church
[28:04] of Lans
[28:09] write for those that have been reading
[28:11] or listening to
[28:12] the the preaching by brother
[28:17] brandham you know brother brandom
[28:22] says I won't read it because I have
[28:24] other things to read
[28:28] hopefully you're reading the message of
[28:30] the age
[28:32] of you understand that's your homework
[28:36] right you should be
[28:38] reading one of those
[28:41] messages one of the messages you should
[28:43] be reading is the age of
[28:48] lcia and brother Bram says a me the
[28:51] messenger would be one like Elijah
[28:58] I want to take
[29:01] that and support it with the word of God
[29:04] with the
[29:05] Bible there's a messenger for this
[29:10] time brother BR says he would be like
[29:13] Elijah
[29:17] uh now it's important to
[29:21] know that the seventh messenger is
[29:26] special you know God works in
[29:29] patterns God works in
[29:32] patterns and he
[29:34] says he's Alpha and
[29:38] Omega and there's something
[29:41] important about the beginning of
[29:44] something and the end of something
[29:48] else that's why he says I'm Alpha and
[29:53] Omega a is the first letter of the
[29:56] alphabet in the Greek GA
[29:59] Omega is the
[30:01] last the
[30:03] alphabet I'm the beginning and I'm the
[30:08] end we see there's something
[30:12] special about what God does in the
[30:16] end we can see it in the
[30:19] creation the first day the second day
[30:22] third
[30:24] day we see how God was
[30:26] advancing repeat God is
[30:29] advancing that's his pattern that's his
[30:32] way the sixth day day
[30:36] arrives he says let us make
[30:39] man what did he
[30:42] do did he do the most important
[30:44] first no he was
[30:47] advancing something happened in the
[30:49] beginning
[30:51] yes that's very similar with what
[30:53] happened in the
[30:55] end we'll speak later about that
[31:00] because we can see the logos on the
[31:01] first
[31:02] day we can see it on the sixth
[31:05] day when he made a
[31:10] man but God is
[31:14] advancing and God begins to culminate
[31:17] all things in the
[31:21] end the seventh messenger is not the
[31:23] same like the
[31:25] rest he's similar to the first
[31:30] which we know which one was the first
[31:32] messenger PA
[31:35] Paul Paul was a
[31:38] prophet
[31:40] irus Wesley up to
[31:43] Wesley we not
[31:46] prophets but the
[31:49] seventh we saw it last
[31:52] time the seventh is a prophet
[31:58] so there's something special about the
[32:02] seventh there's something that God wants
[32:04] to do now one of the
[32:07] reasons that the seventh
[32:11] angel is very
[32:14] important because he
[32:17] introduces the coming of the Lord Jesus
[32:21] Christ he's the one that gives a
[32:25] transition repeat he makes the
[32:27] transition
[32:29] to what's
[32:31] next now another age isn't next what's
[32:35] next the coming of the Lord that's
[32:38] what's
[32:40] next so it's not a easy responsibility
[32:43] responsibility it's a big
[32:48] responsibility and God needed somebody
[32:52] great is that
[32:56] right the Bible says
[32:59] that God did the
[33:01] same in his first
[33:05] coming before his first
[33:09] coming God sent an
[33:12] Elijah repeat before the first
[33:16] coming God sent an
[33:21] Elijah need three times to hear
[33:24] it some don't hear the first time did
[33:28] you know that the first time like we
[33:31] didn't realize what was
[33:35] told repeat in the
[33:38] before repeat before the first
[33:41] coming God sent an
[33:44] Elijah let's say it
[33:47] again before the first
[33:50] coming God s and
[33:53] Elijah we will
[33:55] see that that Elijah
[33:59] was John the
[34:02] Baptist and the Bible
[34:05] says that from all the
[34:09] prophets from all of God's
[34:11] men Jesus Christ said
[34:17] in there had not been a man like John
[34:21] the the
[34:23] greatest until that
[34:25] time was John the
[34:34] APAP if that was in his first
[34:40] coming why would it not be like that the
[34:42] second
[34:44] time we're waiting for his second coming
[34:52] right so I believe God was going to send
[34:54] a great man
[34:57] not just
[35:00] anybody now the
[35:04] Jewish the Jewish have
[35:09] Elijah at the same
[35:13] level with Abraham and
[35:15] Moses the three
[35:22] men that the Jews honor and hold very
[35:26] high are Abra
[35:28] Moses and
[35:32] Elijah and you would say why
[35:36] Elijah why this man
[35:40] Elijah did you know that the Jews honor
[35:42] Elijah so
[35:45] much that every
[35:49] Passover they have this Feast called the
[35:53] Passover they prepare the table
[36:00] and always leave an empty
[36:03] chair when they're going to have the
[36:06] Passover and a wine glass on the
[36:10] table and that
[36:12] chair that's
[36:17] empty is because they wait for
[36:21] Elijah and they leave the door
[36:24] open they leave the door open
[36:28] they leave an empty
[36:30] chair and they leave a wine
[36:35] glass and the door
[36:38] open is for
[36:42] Elijah it's not necessarily for Elijah
[36:44] to walk
[36:45] in they're waiting for the
[36:49] Messiah you know the Jews still wait for
[36:51] the
[36:55] Messi and they know
[36:58] what we're about to
[37:05] read they know Elijah must come before
[37:08] the Messiah
[37:11] does this is not something that only we
[37:16] believe the Jews have believed it since
[37:18] the Old
[37:20] Testament because the Old
[37:22] Testament
[37:24] finishes speaking
[37:28] that before the great and Dreadful day
[37:29] of the
[37:33] Lord God will send elij the
[37:37] prophet let's read it there in Malachi
[37:41] 4 Malachi
[37:52] 4 now to some of you this might just be
[37:55] a summary
[37:57] or just a
[38:04] review but I believe there's some here
[38:06] that haven't heard
[38:10] it we greet everybody watching through
[38:12] the
[38:20] internet we have people inan and Peru
[38:23] California that I know of Phoenix and
[38:26] also our brothers in Phoenix
[38:28] Phenix that are connected right now and
[38:32] may God bless
[38:35] them let's read Malachi 4 verse1 and
[38:41] on for behold the day cometh that shall
[38:44] burn as an
[38:54] oven all the proud and all that do
[38:57] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[38:58] that cometh shall burn them up sayith
[39:01] the Lord of hosts that it shall leave
[39:03] them neither root nor
[39:08] Branch speaking about a special
[39:15] [Music]
[39:18] day it's not speaking like of a day
[39:20] let's say of October
[39:24] 16 but it's also speaking about a period
[39:27] of
[39:28] time called the day of the
[39:32] Lord the day of the Lord or
[39:35] Jehovah repeat the day of
[39:37] Jehovah the day of
[39:40] Jehovah we just read
[39:43] it are you reading your Bible yes you're
[39:46] here you're present
[39:49] yes the day of Jehova shall burn as an
[39:54] oven it's not a nice day right
[40:00] well for the wicked it's not a nice
[40:01] thing for the children of
[40:04] God verse two
[40:13] says but unto you that fear my name
[40:16] shall the son of righteousness arise
[40:18] with healing in his wings and you shall
[40:20] go forth and grow up as Cals of the
[40:22] stall
[40:30] and you shall tread down the wicked for
[40:32] they shall be ashes Under The Souls of
[40:33] your foot feet in the day that I shall
[40:36] do this sayith the Lord of
[40:43] hosts remember ye the law of Moses my
[40:45] servant which I commanded unto him in
[40:47] ARB for all Israel with the statutes and
[40:49] judgments
[40:59] behold I I will send you Elijah the
[41:02] prophet before the coming of the great
[41:03] and Dreadful day of the
[41:07] Lord the day of the Lord is great and
[41:12] Dreadful it's a day where God Will Take
[41:18] Action take action against the proud
[41:20] against the
[41:22] wicked against the devil against sin
[41:29] the day the Lord will bring his
[41:31] judgments to this
[41:35] earth now I ask
[41:38] you did this day happen
[41:43] already I'm not talking about 24 hours
[41:46] I'm talking about a space of time or a
[41:49] period of time did it happen
[41:51] already has earn burned has there been
[41:55] judgment has the sin disappeared
[41:58] appeared no
[42:00] right so that day hasn't happened thanks
[42:04] to
[42:07] God because he is extending his
[42:11] grace but verse five
[42:16] says behold I will send you Elijah the
[42:20] Prophet this is a little
[42:23] odd for you that haven't heard this
[42:26] before
[42:28] this is a little odd who is
[42:34] Elijah we find Elijah for the first
[42:39] time in First
[42:42] Kings chapter
[42:47] 17 now one and
[42:51] seven are very bound to
[42:54] Elijah if you notice
[42:58] [Music]
[43:00] first we find Elijah in First Kings 17
[43:06] verse1 then we find John the
[43:10] Baptist with the spirit of
[43:14] Elijah in Luke
[43:21] 17 and then we see Jesus speaking of the
[43:24] Elijah that would come later
[43:27] in Matthew
[43:35] 17 and then we find out the seventh
[43:39] angel that would be an
[43:41] Elijah and Revelation
[43:47] 107 something that I think is not a
[43:51] coincidence First Kings 171
[44:01] here's where the Bible introduces and we
[44:03] meet Elijah the
[44:17] Tish and Elijah the tipai who was of the
[44:20] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as
[44:22] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[44:24] whom I stand there shall not be do nor
[44:26] reain these years but according to my
[44:37] word we see Elijah and in the age of laa
[44:41] brother brandham describes Elijah a
[44:43] little Elijah the
[44:46] Tish we see Elijah
[44:49] theb in the book of
[44:52] kings and we see his
[44:55] ministry what type of ministry
[44:58] what type of person he was I repeat
[45:03] it he was such an extraordinary
[45:06] character that the
[45:10] Jews the Jews have a chair specifically
[45:13] for
[45:14] him for Moses not for
[45:17] Abraham but for
[45:19] Elijah why number one
[45:28] because Elijah was the seventh I'm sorry
[45:30] the second person that was raptured in
[45:32] that
[45:33] way the first one we know was
[45:36] Enoch then we see
[45:38] Elijah and he was raptured
[45:41] also this is something
[45:47] extraordinary we listen to this like if
[45:49] this was old news we've heard it over
[45:52] and over too much
[45:58] but they knew Elijah was raptured
[46:03] alive that he was raptured
[46:06] alive it was a sudden
[46:11] Rapture if you read when Elijah the Tish
[46:13] was
[46:14] [Music]
[46:16] raptured we know that they were even
[46:18] speaking
[46:20] with they were still speaking with
[46:22] Elisha
[46:27] when all of a sudden there came a
[46:29] whirlwind and took him away on a
[46:34] chariot you
[46:36] [Music]
[46:39] remember this is something
[46:42] extraordinary so we know that
[46:44] Elijah elah Tish the
[46:48] original is tied to the
[46:51] Rapture repeat
[46:54] Elijah is tied
[46:57] the
[46:58] rapture we understand
[47:01] that read the story of Elijah
[47:07] tishbite we know after he was
[47:19] raptured a descended and we know it had
[47:21] the spirit of
[47:25] Elijah that l on
[47:28] Elish and
[47:34] El had the same works and wonders
[47:38] Miracles a similar
[47:41] [Music]
[47:42] Ministry like Elijah the tishbite
[47:46] did so we can see
[47:50] Elisha like the second
[47:53] Elijah repeat
[47:55] elishah was the second
[48:00] Elijah now I'm going to ask you a simple
[48:05] question was Elisha's name
[48:09] Elijah what was Elisha's
[48:14] name
[48:16] Elisha it's simple I'm not trying to
[48:18] trick
[48:20] you but the reason why I ask you
[48:24] that is because some people think
[48:29] if an Elijah will come in our
[48:32] age his name needs to be
[48:37] Elijah but we see it's not
[48:42] so it's the spirit of
[48:47] Elijah who is the holy
[48:50] spirit with Elijah's
[48:53] Ministry that would come
[48:57] through a
[48:59] man that man did not to be named
[49:03] Elijah he is his name could be William
[49:13] brandham what we do
[49:20] know not only Elisha had Elijah's spirit
[49:29] Elisha was Elijah's
[49:32] disciple but then he had Elijah
[49:35] [Music]
[49:40] Spirit but Luke 11:7 let's read it
[49:44] quickly Luke
[49:48] 117 the story of John the
[49:51] Baptist of John
[49:56] say the Baptist because that's what they
[49:58] called him because he
[50:04] baptized so we don't confuse him with
[50:06] John the disciple the loved or the
[50:09] Revelator but John the
[50:13] Baptist do you remember John the
[50:21] Baptist he was six months older than
[50:24] Jesus uh
[50:29] so his mother was pregnant six months
[50:31] before Mary
[50:33] was and before his mother Elizabeth was
[50:38] pregnant an angel appears to his
[50:41] father and this
[50:45] Angel tells his
[50:47] father
[50:50] Zachariah speaking about
[50:53] John this son that would come
[50:57] named
[51:03] John and he shall go before him in the
[51:06] spirit and power of
[51:08] Elias repeat with the spirit and
[51:12] power spirit and
[51:17] power now was his name gonna be Elijah
[51:20] or
[51:21] Elias what was going to be his name ju
[51:25] John
[51:27] John would be his name
[51:30] but he would have the spirit and power
[51:33] of
[51:35] Elija just like
[51:38] Elijah just like just like Elijah and
[51:42] elsh in other words the same
[51:45] Ministry that Elish had that Elisha
[51:50] had a similar
[51:53] Ministry John the Baptist would also
[51:56] have
[51:58] are you with
[52:01] me
[52:05] now this is John the
[52:10] Baptist do you
[52:18] know a little of what John the Baptist
[52:24] did we know he baptized on the Jordan
[52:26] River for
[52:30] repentance but there was a special job
[52:33] he
[52:37] had and he would prepare or forerun the
[52:41] way for the
[52:44] Messiah prepare the way for the Lord
[52:46] Jesus
[52:49] Christ and we'll speak on that later
[52:55] also but he was Associated also with a
[53:00] coming with a coming of the Lord Jesus
[53:04] [Music]
[53:06] Christ I want to read something from the
[53:08] prophet
[53:13] here the message the Lan Church
[53:17] age speaking about Elijah
[53:20] TI not a learned
[53:24] person Elijah was not a learned person
[53:29] the John was not a learned
[53:35] person Luke 167 the Bible said that he
[53:38] was the child was as soon as he was
[53:41] born he took to the
[53:46] Wilderness was in the wilderness till
[53:48] the day he was showed to
[53:50] Israel that's
[53:52] right Luke
[53:55] 167 the 80th verse if you want to mark
[53:57] it
[54:01] down this Prophet will also be a moody
[54:03] sort of guy
[54:07] Elijah after he had a great
[54:10] meeting nobody could get along with
[54:13] him Elijah had
[54:16] spells when he went out there and called
[54:18] fire down out of
[54:21] heaven and burn up the altars of ba and
[54:24] everything he run Into the Wilderness
[54:27] and said
[54:30] Lord I'm no better than my fathers let
[54:32] me die is that
[54:35] right he sat under a juniper
[54:38] tree and after the great
[54:41] Revival now he wanted to die and
[54:45] John when they cast him in
[54:48] prison this foul
[54:52] woman he sat back there and began to get
[54:54] moody
[55:05] I believe P or one of them
[55:09] said his Eagle Eye got filed over in
[55:14] jail he sent some of his
[55:18] disciples and while he had declared in
[55:21] said there's the Lamb of
[55:24] God that takes away the the sin of the
[55:30] world John saw the pillar of fire
[55:32] hanging over him like a dove and come
[55:35] down settled upon
[55:38] Him witnessed it all and
[55:42] said that's the Lamb of
[55:45] God and said I have need to be baptized
[55:49] of you and why you coming to
[55:52] me Jesus said suffer it to be so now
[55:59] so now we
[56:04] see Elisha was similar to
[56:09] Elijah John the Baptist looked similar
[56:11] to
[56:14] Elijah so if another Elijah would come
[56:16] in our
[56:19] time you have to be similar or look
[56:22] similar to Elijah the prophet
[56:24] also are you with me brother
[56:30] had to be the same Spirit and the same
[56:34] power now let's read Matthew
[56:44] 17 Matthew 17 from verse 10 and
[56:50] on these are scriptures the majority of
[56:52] you know
[56:56] but we always need to review the
[57:00] these to make sure we're on the same
[57:05] page Matthew
[57:11] 1710 chapter 17 of
[57:17] Matthew speaks to us of a
[57:19] Transfiguration of the Lord Jesus
[57:21] Christ it was a special event that
[57:24] happened
[57:29] we know that God took the three of them
[57:31] who were
[57:35] they we heard it what two weeks
[57:41] ago Peter James and
[57:44] John when God was going to do something
[57:46] great he would take Peter James and
[57:50] John and he took them with
[57:52] him and there he appeared
[57:58] I'm sorry there appeared Moses and
[58:01] Elijah his face like the
[58:05] sun repeat his face like the
[58:10] sun now his face or countenance like the
[58:13] sun we're going to
[58:17] see speaks about the day of the
[58:23] Lord about the day of the Lord
[58:27] but the thing is that they saw this
[58:30] scene and when the scene
[58:33] ended Moses and Elijah
[58:38] disappeared and all of that
[58:42] happened and his disciples asked him
[58:49] saying why then say the scribes that
[58:51] Elias must come must first
[58:54] come they were a bit
[58:57] confused up to that
[59:02] moment the disciples didn't not have
[59:04] Mark
[59:05] MTH the New Testament did not
[59:08] exist the Bible they did
[59:11] have was from Genesis to
[59:14] Malachi less books 39 books let's
[59:20] say 39 books they
[59:24] had and they knew very
[59:31] well that elah had to come before the
[59:34] great and Dreadful
[59:36] day so then they're
[59:39] asking where's
[59:41] Elijah thou are the
[59:46] Messiah and it looks like the day of the
[59:48] of the Lord is
[59:55] not so where is Elijah or why were we
[59:57] preached to for so
[1:00:00] long scries the Pharisees and all the
[1:00:04] Jews that Elijah need to come
[1:00:08] first they were a little
[1:00:11] confused this wasn't making sense to
[1:00:16] them they knew Malachi 45 and6 very
[1:00:21] well it was a scripture that was They
[1:00:24] Knew by heart
[1:00:27] that
[1:00:29] Elijah they were waiting for
[1:00:34] Elijah did you know the
[1:00:42] Jews they have Elijah as very
[1:00:46] interesting
[1:00:50] character many rabbis tell that they
[1:00:53] seen
[1:00:54] Elijah they write in their
[1:00:58] that elah has appeared and has shown
[1:01:00] them certain things
[1:01:05] um some see as he appears in one way and
[1:01:08] in a different
[1:01:11] [Music]
[1:01:13] way these are well recognized rabbis
[1:01:16] that say they've seen
[1:01:20] Elijah because God kind of uses Elijah
[1:01:26] in different
[1:01:29] forms but either way they
[1:01:32] knew and
[1:01:35] believed to their own way of
[1:01:42] thinking sooner later Elijah the Tish
[1:01:45] needs to
[1:01:48] return to announce the coming of the
[1:01:53] Messiah that's why today they leave the
[1:01:56] door
[1:01:57] open it's not for him to walk in
[1:02:01] necessarily but they know when Elijah
[1:02:06] returns they want to run out and meet
[1:02:08] him as soon as
[1:02:10] possible so they leave the door
[1:02:12] open so they can be
[1:02:16] prepared to go and meet
[1:02:21] Elijah that's how strongly they're
[1:02:24] waiting for Elijah
[1:02:29] so it's not a surprise that they would
[1:02:30] ask this
[1:02:32] question so long we've been waiting for
[1:02:36] him what happened
[1:02:41] here we're leaving the door
[1:02:44] open to meet
[1:02:49] him and
[1:02:50] if wants to walk in and drink some wine
[1:02:54] he has a chair ready
[1:02:59] but they were waiting for Elijah very
[1:03:03] strongly so their question does not
[1:03:05] surprise
[1:03:08] us verse 11 and Jesus answered and said
[1:03:11] unto
[1:03:15] them Elias truly shall come
[1:03:19] first and restore all
[1:03:23] things repeat
[1:03:26] Elias truly shall first
[1:03:28] come and restore all
[1:03:33] things this is speaking future
[1:03:36] tense not past
[1:03:40] tense here's where the denominations get
[1:03:44] confused because they
[1:03:47] think churches normally
[1:03:53] teach that verse 11 and 12 speak of the
[1:03:56] same
[1:03:59] one but verse 11 is speaking on someone
[1:04:02] coming in the
[1:04:05] future and verse 12 is speaking of
[1:04:07] somebody that already
[1:04:12] came verse
[1:04:15] 11 up to that point had not
[1:04:20] happened but verse 12 had already
[1:04:23] happened there two different
[1:04:26] people verse
[1:04:28] 11 is speaking of a future
[1:04:32] Elijah elas truly shall first
[1:04:37] come in English I like how it says it
[1:04:39] better shall it first
[1:04:43] come and restore all
[1:04:46] things you cannot put that in past
[1:04:51] tense that Elijah had not come
[1:04:54] yet the that would restore all
[1:04:57] things but Jesus tells
[1:05:00] them Elias shall come
[1:05:11] first and then he throws them a curve
[1:05:14] ball and he tells
[1:05:16] them to confuse them a little
[1:05:21] more but I say unto you that Elias is is
[1:05:24] come already
[1:05:26] now this is another
[1:05:28] Elijah one will
[1:05:31] come and one
[1:05:36] came verse 11 is an Elijah that shall
[1:05:39] first
[1:05:41] come and 12 is one that came
[1:05:46] already then he says but
[1:05:49] have oh I'm sorry and they knew him not
[1:05:58] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:05:59] listed likewise shall the son of man
[1:06:02] suff suffer of
[1:06:07] them I don't know about
[1:06:15] you I might not understand Hebrew like
[1:06:18] my first
[1:06:22] tongue but I think we need Revelation to
[1:06:25] understand what he
[1:06:28] said and I believe that's what they
[1:06:30] received in verse
[1:06:33] 13 because Jesus doesn't tell them that
[1:06:36] was John the
[1:06:38] Baptist he left it like a
[1:06:41] mystery well thanks to
[1:06:44] God that his bride will
[1:06:48] understand they understood
[1:06:55] then the disciples understood that he
[1:06:57] spake unto them of John the
[1:07:00] Baptist I imagine they began to speak
[1:07:02] between
[1:07:04] them what is the Lord talking about here
[1:07:07] and one of them must have
[1:07:10] said I think he means John the Baptist
[1:07:14] because John the
[1:07:15] Baptist meets all the
[1:07:18] requirements Jesus didn't have to tell
[1:07:21] them I believe it's the same thing in
[1:07:23] this
[1:07:24] time there are
[1:07:26] people as much that you prove to
[1:07:31] them that William Bram meets all
[1:07:35] requirements there are people that will
[1:07:36] never see
[1:07:38] it but there will be
[1:07:41] people see brother William bram's
[1:07:45] life and will
[1:07:47] notice or find out by
[1:07:53] Revelation that the Elijah that would
[1:07:55] come was brother
[1:07:58] brandham it needs to be a revelation
[1:08:05] brother verse
[1:08:09] 11 Elias truly shall first
[1:08:15] come first before
[1:08:21] what because if he's speaking of
[1:08:23] something first speaking of something
[1:08:25] that's going to happen
[1:08:29] before and it's the same thing we read
[1:08:31] in Malachi
[1:08:33] 4 behold I sent you the prophet
[1:08:36] Elias
[1:08:39] before the great and Dreadful
[1:08:42] day before the great and Dreadful
[1:08:45] day brother Bram
[1:08:48] says in the age
[1:08:52] ofia John the Baptist was an Elijah
[1:08:57] we all agree
[1:08:59] right the Bible told us we just read
[1:09:03] it John the Baptist was an
[1:09:08] Elijah but the great and Dreadful day of
[1:09:10] the Lord come after John the
[1:09:14] Baptist no it
[1:09:16] didn't the Earth hasn't burned yet the
[1:09:20] judgments haven't fallen on the
[1:09:23] earth the Great day of the Lord has not
[1:09:26] happened
[1:09:30] yet so Malachi 45 is not speaking of
[1:09:33] John the
[1:09:35] Baptist speaking of the future Elijah to
[1:09:41] come so will there be an Elijah before
[1:09:44] the great and Dreadful
[1:09:50] day
[1:09:54] well let's stop there please
[1:10:21] stand I
[1:10:25] there's many
[1:10:27] ways to
[1:10:33] identify that brother brandham is the
[1:10:36] Elijah of this
[1:10:42] time there's so many
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:48] identifications if you look for it
[1:10:50] you'll find
[1:10:52] it we see the first Elijah
[1:10:55] the
[1:10:58] tishbite controlling
[1:11:01] nature that's the first thing we read
[1:11:03] about
[1:11:05] him is that he's controlling the
[1:11:08] nature he says there will not be
[1:11:12] rain according to my
[1:11:18] word that's something that was special
[1:11:21] about
[1:11:23] Elijah he was controlling
[1:11:27] nature and we know that even here in
[1:11:32] Colorado we see our present
[1:11:36] Elijah that stopped a
[1:11:47] storm that's not it that's not the only
[1:11:50] thing we
[1:11:51] see but greater things than that
[1:11:57] but that fall in line with Elijah's
[1:12:02] Ministry restoring the
[1:12:07] altar introducing the true God that's
[1:12:11] what Elijah
[1:12:14] did he says I'm going to prove to you
[1:12:16] who the real God is you remember you
[1:12:21] don't when he had a
[1:12:24] Revival he had a
[1:12:26] Revival with all the
[1:12:30] denominations yes brother brandham
[1:12:35] says he gathered all the
[1:12:37] denominations all the false
[1:12:41] prophets and prove who the real God
[1:12:44] was that's the same thing John the
[1:12:47] Baptist did John the
[1:12:49] Baptist
[1:12:51] introduced the true Messiah
[1:12:55] the true word of
[1:12:58] God and in our
[1:13:00] time we had an
[1:13:03] Elijah rival after
[1:13:07] Revival proving who the real God
[1:13:15] was we could last a
[1:13:22] week speaking about similarities of
[1:13:25] William brandham and Elijah
[1:13:30] tishbite but God has brought us our
[1:13:33] Elijah
[1:13:37] already and may God reveal to
[1:13:41] us that it settles in our
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:46] heart don't believe just because the
[1:13:49] pastor
[1:13:51] says don't believe just because a good
[1:13:53] preacher say
[1:13:56] go and find out
[1:13:58] yourself make
[1:14:01] sure messenger for this day
[1:14:06] is don't believe it just cuz your father
[1:14:08] does just cuz your mother
[1:14:12] does go and do your own
[1:14:16] investigating go and
[1:14:20] know the messenger God sent you for your
[1:14:23] time
[1:14:25] God
[1:14:26] promised and he has fulfilled his
[1:14:30] word now it's necessary that
[1:14:35] we the Elijah of our
[1:14:41] time
[1:14:44] amen God bless you brother

[1:24:18] family that was the last
[1:24:22] time Titus asked me how do you see
[1:24:24] Mexico
[1:24:27] now since
[1:24:30] then and I said it looks better
[1:24:34] today because the last time I
[1:24:38] came there was cars on fire next to the
[1:24:42] road burnt cars burnt cars next to the
[1:24:46] road and there was a lot of
[1:24:53] crosses and this time it look very
[1:24:55] different from what I saw it the last
[1:24:57] time I was
[1:25:01] there it was a very good experience for
[1:25:05] me it was my first time going to Oran
[1:25:08] like I
[1:25:12] said After experiencing this trip with
[1:25:14] brother Fernando his wife and my
[1:25:19] wife and our pastor and other brothers
[1:25:21] that went with
[1:25:22] us it was a
[1:25:29] blessing I want to thank brother Edgar
[1:25:31] and his wife sister Blanca for opening
[1:25:33] the doors of their home to
[1:25:38] us it was a blessing to get to know them
[1:25:40] more and stay with
[1:25:43] them on
[1:25:48] Saturday brother Titus asked us toh
[1:25:51] share something during the service
[1:25:58] impossibility
[1:26:07] impossible that can be
[1:26:12] possible and I believe in this
[1:26:15] time there's a lot of cases like
[1:26:21] that that we think that there's many
[1:26:23] things that can't be
[1:26:26] possible but they can be
[1:26:30] possible and it's if you
[1:26:34] believe not depending on what's
[1:26:39] happening but it's on how much you trust
[1:26:42] God or believe in
[1:26:45] God that's what the our theme
[1:26:51] was and I was thinking and meditating
[1:26:53] about something
[1:26:56] as we were sharing about Abraham that
[1:27:00] day Abraham waited 10
[1:27:05] years
[1:27:09] 25 Abraham waited 25 years for the
[1:27:12] promise of God to
[1:27:18] come and sometimes we get tired over
[1:27:21] waiting one day
[1:27:27] we we wait one day and we say
[1:27:34] well but if you
[1:27:36] wait and
[1:27:40] believe and keep
[1:27:43] believing God can make it
[1:27:48] possible doesn't matter how impossible
[1:27:50] it
[1:27:52] looks God bless
[1:27:56] you and thank you for your
[1:28:00] prayers it was a beautiful
[1:28:04] experience to meet all the brothers in
[1:28:09] Uruapan
[1:28:14] amen we're very happy to be
[1:28:17] back um it just
[1:28:22] me not because I didn't enjoy over
[1:28:26] there but for my legal
[1:28:29] status the devil puts things in our way
[1:28:33] or in the mind of of in our
[1:28:36] minds and he makes it
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:44] difficult I don't want to get too much
[1:28:46] into detail on my experience at the
[1:28:49] airport but I fought struggled and
[1:28:52] fought and battled against the
[1:28:58] enemy just to tell you that my fight
[1:29:01] from s from Denver to San Diego never
[1:29:03] took
[1:29:05] off and the battle started since
[1:29:09] then I want to thank my
[1:29:14] wife she never lost courage never lost
[1:29:17] hope never lost
[1:29:20] faith that's what motivated me to
[1:29:22] continue
[1:29:26] we spent over two days at the
[1:29:31] airport but thanks to God we were able
[1:29:34] to go and
[1:29:35] return with God's
[1:29:38] help I'm happy with
[1:29:41] God with my pastor and the
[1:29:47] support uh the paperwork wasn't
[1:29:52] easy but thanks to to God and my
[1:29:55] pastor The Impossible was made possible
[1:30:04] um we were in the theme of uran in uran
[1:30:08] believing the
[1:30:13] impossible it was a theme the people
[1:30:15] inan had to
[1:30:22] listen and I was able to share with
[1:30:24] brother Felix on
[1:30:30] Saturday I shared a few stories in the
[1:30:32] Bible where the impossible was made
[1:30:35] possible Felix Felix brother
[1:30:39] Felix shared his
[1:30:42] testimony that was a true
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:48] blessing also the preaching of brother
[1:30:50] Vidal and our pastor the following day
[1:30:56] we know that Souls were
[1:30:58] delivered people were restored and
[1:31:03] healed we know we have a family
[1:31:10] there we want to thank for all their
[1:31:12] attentions towards
[1:31:18] us and if I get more into detail tell
[1:31:21] you of more than 50 plates they served
[1:31:23] us over there
[1:31:26] they overfed
[1:31:28] us and it was a true
[1:31:32] blessing have gone you already know how
[1:31:36] they treat you over there the ones that
[1:31:39] haven't gone
[1:31:41] yet I encourage
[1:31:45] you maybe there's some that can't
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:50] go but your support is not in vain with
[1:31:52] the pastor
[1:31:54] with the money or helping with
[1:31:58] money all of that is worth
[1:32:02] it to see the situation how they live
[1:32:05] over
[1:32:06] there I'm not going to feel pity for the
[1:32:09] Breen because I feel pity for the
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:15] devil over there it's a different
[1:32:19] world I see how the children live
[1:32:23] don't live stuck to their cell
[1:32:29] phones my wife and I can share that we
[1:32:32] played more than four hours playing
[1:32:33] volleyball with them
[1:32:39] nonstop even the children forgot to use
[1:32:41] the
[1:32:42] restroom they had so much
[1:32:45] fun so the brothers ended up joining the
[1:32:48] game it was a great blessing
[1:32:54] one more time we thank uran the Church
[1:32:57] of
[1:32:59] Uruapan for all their love and
[1:33:01] attention to my pastor
[1:33:09] Pastor that without you none of this
[1:33:11] would be
[1:33:17] possible and my wife and I returned home
[1:33:20] with the desire and the hope to be able
[1:33:22] to go back there
[1:33:26] and if I can share to you a little of my
[1:33:29] legal
[1:33:30] status on the trip we
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:35] made I was able to acquire a legal entry
[1:33:38] to the United
[1:33:40] States through the marriage with my
[1:33:45] wife I'll be able to receive residency
[1:33:55] that right now is from about two months
[1:33:57] to two
[1:33:59] years through the Journey of six
[1:34:04] months so we hope in God and trus in
[1:34:09] God that next year we can return
[1:34:12] toan God bless you
[1:34:14] [Applause]
[1:34:22] brotherr amen
[1:34:27] one of the
[1:34:30] things that I can see how God places
[1:34:33] everything in
[1:34:38] order is that truly we didn't need to
[1:34:47] be fando well he went because that was
[1:34:50] the dates they approved for brother
[1:34:52] Fernando to go um
[1:34:56] but our brother called
[1:35:03] brother he said on that day he
[1:35:09] felt he said he's been many years just
[1:35:12] listening to the
[1:35:16] tapes but he said on that day he felt to
[1:35:19] speak to the people of the
[1:35:20] church because he wanted to go to church
[1:35:24] he didn't know we were
[1:35:29] there but on that day he said I want to
[1:35:32] go to that church and that's the day we
[1:35:34] were
[1:35:38] there and that's he told us that he
[1:35:41] wanted me to be his
[1:35:47] Pastor so I believe God placed
[1:35:49] everything in order I didn't plan
[1:35:51] it so may God bless you
[1:35:56] um brother Ed's
[1:36:02] birthdays and to the brothers in as
[1:36:14] well hopefully we'll show in the videos
