[21:20] DS second Samuel
[21:22] chapter 12 verse 10. Diaz
[21:26] [Music]
[21:29] it says like this
[21:31] they say I see now therefore the sword
[21:33] shall never depart from thine house
[21:35] because thou has despised me and has
[21:38] taken the the wife of Uriah the hittai
[21:41] to be thy wife
[22:00] evil against thee out of thine own house
[22:03] and I will take the wise before thine
[22:05] eyes and I will give them unto thy
[22:07] neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives
[22:10] in the sight of this son
[22:13] is
[22:24] [Music]
[22:26] big one
[22:33] thou has given great occasion to the
[22:36] enemies of the Lord to blasphemy the
[22:38] child also that is Born Into thee shall
[22:41] surely die
[22:42] foreign
[23:49] thank you and we ask of all these things
[23:54] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[24:00] God bless you once again
[24:03] it's truly privileged and honor to be
[24:05] amongst the Saints
[24:08] the title of our time of this preaching
[24:11] this morning
[24:14] the responsibility of Free Will
[24:17] responsibilities
[24:25] and I'm going to read one more scripture
[24:29] Joshua chapter 24.
[24:34] we give thanks unto our pastor for
[24:37] entrusting Us in this evening
[24:40] to speak to his beautiful people
[24:44] are you happy to be here
[24:49] key are you here estaki that's good yes
[24:53] and the word of God says like this
[24:55] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[24:58] him in the sincerity and in truth and
[25:01] put away the gods which your father
[25:02] serve on the other side of the flood and
[25:04] then and in Egypt and Survey the Lord
[25:09] is
[25:24] unto you to serve the Lord to you this
[25:27] day choose you this day whom ye will
[25:30] serve whether the gods which your father
[25:32] served that were on the other side of
[25:34] the flood go ahead
[25:40] Vice
[25:43] Cielos dioses Padres
[25:54] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[25:57] land ye dwelt but as for me and my house
[25:59] we will serve the Lord
[26:03] and amen amen now if we notice there it
[26:07] says choose you this day
[26:12] brother Branham says that God allowed
[26:15] man God has allowed a law of choosing
[26:21] and a free moral agency
[26:24] and God has left the law of Free Will
[26:28] here in this earth
[26:31] a beloved Prophet also says that when he
[26:35] did that
[26:38] he left free will
[26:41] celebrate man equal unto God El is
[26:47] a minor God yes foreign
[27:50] Nathaniel's telling them the
[27:52] consequences of that one choice
[27:58] he tells them that the sword shall never
[28:01] depart from thine house
[28:04] and then in verse 11 it says I will rise
[28:06] up in an evil against thee out of thine
[28:09] own house
[28:16] and as you continue reading the story of
[28:19] David there
[28:21] we know that amnon and his sister that
[28:25] what happened there
[28:34] where the his brother slept with his
[28:37] sister amen
[28:39] you can see verse 11 there being
[28:42] fulfilled
[28:47] in you say in the verse 11 yes
[28:51] and I will take thy wives before Thine
[28:54] Eyes
[29:00] again it's not me it's what the word is
[29:03] saying exactly
[29:07] and he says and give them unto Thy
[29:10] Neighbor this is
[29:18] thank you
[29:20] to sleeping with the 10 concubines
[29:24] in which King David Left Behind when he
[29:27] fled Las cuales
[29:30] again
[29:32] the consequences of a choice
[29:40] again we go back to the title the
[29:43] responsibility of Free Will
[29:45] responsibility
[29:47] and thanks be regards
[29:51] he had a perfect plan set up already for
[29:53] each and every one of us
[29:57] and you knew all the decisions that we
[29:59] were going to make good or bad yes
[30:04] and again he had to leave this order or
[30:08] this this love of Free Will and then
[30:16] to freely choose to pick what you want
[30:19] to do
[30:39] you're truly not knowing god in his
[30:42] fullness
[30:45] knowing those attributes that he's had
[30:48] inside of him
[30:50] they had to be proven one way or another
[31:00] and that's why he left the law of
[31:02] choosing pores
[31:08] because again we would be like the
[31:10] angels
[31:11] Los Angeles because then we would we
[31:14] wouldn't be able to sing those songs
[31:15] that we sing now
[31:18] my provider
[31:36] knowing everything that was gonna happen
[31:40] in everything perfectly planned out for
[31:43] us
[31:45] we know if we choose God
[31:49] it was never us choosing God truly
[31:54] it's got a part of God in us choosing
[31:56] him
[31:59] again God wants us to have an education
[32:02] in his life
[32:07] to learn later on
[32:15] because we know later on
[32:19] ruling
[32:46] he says now we're all born a free moral
[32:49] agent to make any decision that we each
[32:51] wish too
[32:59] God just does that
[33:03] because he must put every man on the
[33:06] same basis or he put the wrong or he put
[33:08] the wrong man he put the first man on
[33:11] the wrong basis
[33:26] he says see we're just exactly tonight
[33:28] like Adam and Eve
[33:48] say it again when he chose to sleep
[33:56] gracias well thanks be to God that God
[33:59] uses the mistakes of man perogacious
[34:04] to make something great out of that
[34:08] the prophet says life and death
[34:12] we can make our own choice
[34:15] it's up to you to make it
[34:19] that's the way Adam did it is
[34:23] you see they made the wrong choice
[34:29] and now by the whole Human by the whole
[34:32] race of human race under death
[34:38] the penalty of death and then God came
[34:42] down in the former man taking the death
[34:44] and paid the penalty of death that is
[34:47] subjected that desire to be free could
[34:50] be free
[34:55] foreign
[35:52] just pull us out through something and
[35:54] say I'll save you whether you have
[35:56] whether you want to be saved or not
[36:06] then he put Adam and Eve on the wrong
[36:09] basis
[36:13] you see but but each one of us has to
[36:17] choose this day between death and life
[36:25] again we go back to the Free Will
[36:30] and God cannot be a a just God
[36:35] if he made man fall
[36:38] permit
[36:40] and then later on try to come and be a
[36:42] redeemer
[37:12] he
[37:15] fornicated we know that foreign
[37:43] is
[38:47] don't be surprised later on of the
[38:50] consequences
[38:53] again we always ask ourselves why
[38:58] did this happen
[39:03] again we can't understand why because
[39:10] that we have a God that not only is he
[39:14] our judge
[39:16] but he also is our father
[39:19] the religious World paints us paints him
[39:22] as just simply a judge
[39:26] but this message shows us that not only
[39:28] is he a judge knows
[39:31] he's also a father
[39:34] I guess he corrects his son when he
[39:37] makes a mistake
[39:39] he corrects his daughter when they make
[39:42] a mistake
[39:44] but also being a father
[39:46] he also provides a way back
[39:51] he provides them the ways back to him
[39:53] with open arms
[39:55] again
[39:57] [Music]
[40:00] knowing all the decisions we will make
[40:02] one day foreign
[41:02] we'll choose something that we think is
[41:05] okay
[41:08] but we truly don't look at the greater
[41:12] picture
[41:16] and see it later on the consequences
[41:18] what that may happen
[41:23] again
[41:25] the people of Israel didn't have to go
[41:29] through all the chaos
[41:32] when Absalom came into Power
[41:35] let's kick David out
[41:40] we don't have to suffer we don't have to
[41:44] go through hardships
[41:51] because the only thing remember that
[41:54] we're taking from this Earth is
[41:57] the character right
[41:59] and God allows all these bad things
[42:31] you know how to forgive someone
[42:35] maybe never desert forgiveness
[42:43] someone that never deserved
[42:46] someone that never deserves
[42:49] an opportunity but that's why God allows
[42:53] all this foreign
[43:02] indigo
[43:06] [Applause]
[43:12] Manos
[43:15] God bless you Brothers
[43:18] uh
[43:22] the Holy Spirit Works
[43:26] brother Gustavo was pretty much reading
[43:28] my notes
[43:31] if you could follow me the second Samuel
[43:33] chapter 12. amen
[43:36] hope you're feeling at home
[43:40] seem a little serious this evening
[43:44] we've come to learn from the word of God
[43:46] Amen
[43:48] to come with expectation
[43:51] a
[44:07] okay
[44:10] and David's
[44:13] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[44:14] against the man and he said to Nathan as
[44:17] the Lord liveth the man that hath done
[44:19] this thing shall surely die yes
[44:23] 13. it is
[44:34] and David said unto Nathan I have sinned
[44:37] against the Lord and Nathan said unto
[44:39] David the Lord also has put away thy sin
[44:41] Thou shalt not die
[44:45] and one last scripture in the Book of
[44:47] Psalms chapter 51 verse 14.
[44:50] I'll be reading it in English and it
[44:53] says deliver me from blood guiltiness
[45:05] deliver me from blood guiltiness
[45:11] oh God thou God of my salvation
[45:15] salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud
[45:17] of thy
[45:20] righteousnessia now I want to focus here
[45:23] on this word
[45:25] we're still talking about David
[45:28] Bathsheba and Uriah
[45:31] um
[45:33] but this is more when David is repenting
[45:37] now
[45:39] um
[45:44] You can already understand it by just
[45:47] the word right it's
[45:50] the fact or state of being guilty of
[45:53] murder or Bloodshed is
[46:09] Lord Jesus Christ sovereign
[47:00] um
[47:01] from a sharing his death
[47:04] we are all guilt we can all be guilty
[47:08] I'm taking it slow so we understand both
[47:11] things
[47:13] David who is guilty of uriah's blood
[47:16] David
[47:19] and we can also be guilty of Jesus
[47:25] Christ I just want the youth to
[47:27] understand this also
[47:30] those who rejects
[47:33] the spies
[47:35] neglects
[47:37] the claims of the Lord
[47:40] [Music]
[47:41] those who refuse to bow to Jesus
[47:48] they're actually mocking Jesus they
[47:52] scorched him
[47:54] and put him to death rights and speaking
[47:58] against his gospel
[48:00] into writing his servants
[48:04] and denying his deity
[48:08] and then refusing to believe in him
[48:17] of crucifying the Lord Of Glory
[48:21] because if the Way I Live Now I was
[48:24] living back then
[48:26] [Music]
[48:29] my life would prove me me Vida that I
[48:33] would crucify Jesus
[48:36] that's personal to me
[48:40] we have committed the action of
[48:42] crucifying him
[48:45] but the blood
[48:48] cometh upon to our condemnation guys
[48:56] unless by faith it comes upon us
[49:01] to our acceptance
[49:04] and forgiveness so the blood can do two
[49:08] things
[49:10] I'm going very slow for you brother
[49:13] either the blood of Jesus will fall on
[49:16] you
[49:19] and cleanse your hearts
[49:28] and the blood of Uriah
[49:31] was condemning David
[49:34] he had blood guiltiness on him
[49:41] now uh something that can just stand out
[49:46] all right I'll go
[49:47] saliente about the story that's the
[49:50] Historia is that we can stop while we're
[49:53] ahead okay
[49:56] and bad things happen to good people
[50:01] um
[50:12] and there's consequences to our actions
[50:15] as our brother was saying consequences
[50:19] now first David had two opportunities
[50:24] if you didn't know David was ahead of
[50:27] his sinus
[50:30] or it could have been ahead
[50:34] he had two opportunities
[50:37] when he saw this woman showering
[50:42] when he was on the rooftop
[50:45] the first way he could have been ahead
[50:49] um
[50:53] he should have been on the battlefield
[50:57] not walking on the rooftops
[51:01] but anyways once he saw that woman
[51:05] he could have left
[51:08] but he didn't
[51:11] he asked about her
[51:14] and he found out she was married he said
[51:19] and he asked to bring her
[51:23] but his mind was already made up
[51:27] and on what he wanted
[51:30] that's why it was hard for him to leave
[51:32] foreign
[52:21] um
[52:22] what is it 27 12.
[52:26] says a prudent man for seeth the evil
[52:30] and heideth himself
[52:32] but the simple pass on and are punished
[52:38] this is
[52:50] we should be prudence
[52:53] and seeing the dangerous and making
[52:56] certain choices
[52:58] decision if we don't know we'll find
[53:02] ourselves paying the penalty later
[53:07] there's always a consequence
[53:10] whether it be sooner
[53:15] it can be a short term or a long term
[53:21] and now Uriah as a good person and don't
[53:24] say
[53:25] I admire you
[53:28] I wish my brother Eric didn't speak
[53:31] about Uriah as much
[53:34] because I wanted to speak about him
[53:37] but Uriah lost his life
[54:01] when
[55:01] having service brother
[55:03] we're in spiritual warfare
[55:06] spiritual when God's Army is here
[55:10] and the devil is going to catch us as an
[55:13] easy prey out there
[55:17] you know we have to be with the army
[55:19] with the yeah with the sheep together
[55:23] the flock defends itself
[55:27] and Uriah was saying
[55:31] that he could not go with his wife
[55:35] he could not enjoy what the soldiers his
[55:39] brothers could not enjoy
[55:43] he said if these servants can't and I
[55:46] can't either because
[55:49] that was his own wife
[55:52] you know that makes me know
[55:55] that he saw her more than a wife
[56:00] perhaps a daughter of God
[56:03] has a sister you know to be faithful to
[56:07] his post of Duty
[56:10] and now there's consequences to our
[56:13] actions all right consequences
[56:16] the results of David's adultery result
[56:21] had multiple consequences
[56:25] although he tried to prevent them
[56:29] anyone try to prevent
[57:29] you shouldn't feel that that can't
[57:31] happen peligro
[57:46] another reason why I believe this
[57:49] happened
[57:52] Revelation 3 2 says
[57:56] apocalypse is
[57:59] watchful and strengthen the things which
[58:02] remain
[58:06] that are ready to die for I have not
[58:09] found that it works perfect before God
[58:13] now for David to be relaxing
[58:18] as my brother said um Eric he said David
[58:22] was bloodthirsty
[58:53] mind emotions and actions
[58:58] but David's laziness and rooting this
[59:01] out
[59:09] trans lapa into a laziness of calling
[59:13] and purpose
[59:16] our brother Eric was talking about
[59:18] distractions
[59:21] he got distracted by Fame
[59:26] and success we were speaking with
[59:30] brother Fidel maybe he got used to
[59:32] winning
[59:35] maybe you got used to coming to church
[59:37] and having Victory all the time
[59:41] you know you got used to the good things
[59:45] but that shouldn't be we don't know
[59:49] David
[59:51] was a warrior
[59:53] to establish and lead a God-fearing
[59:56] Nation
[1:00:01] for like the most of us
[1:00:04] must have grown tired
[1:00:07] how many get tired of church
[1:01:08] now eventually all of David's decisions
[1:01:11] were done poorly
[1:01:15] foreign
[1:02:07] except that you have a sinful nature in
[1:02:11] accept accepted
[1:02:14] acceptable except that you have a simple
[1:02:17] question
[1:02:19] while on Earth
[1:02:21] you will be sinful
[1:02:24] and so the Lord the Rapture comes
[1:02:28] but guard your hearts
[1:02:31] and don't come into that routine
[1:02:35] if I can leave you with this verse
[1:02:39] it's Romans 8 28 says we know that all
[1:02:42] things work together for good to them
[1:02:44] that love God
[1:02:49] now the Royal bloodline kept coming
[1:02:52] through Solomon
[1:02:56] it didn't matter what David's
[1:02:59] consequences were
[1:03:02] yes uh his child died
[1:03:05] you know the same thing continued
[1:03:08] happening in his life adultery
[1:03:14] David
[1:03:37] and
[1:03:39] all things work for good
[1:03:41] doesn't matter how vile
[1:03:45] how evil
[1:03:48] David wanted to kill the man that took
[1:03:51] the little sheep in the parable
[1:03:58] but Nathan responds to him with Grace
[1:04:04] you shall not die
[1:04:09] what if somebody told you that yes
[1:04:12] can you be in the steps of David tonight
[1:04:17] when you would desire someone's death
[1:04:21] and they're talking about you
[1:04:24] yet they forgive you
[1:04:27] it's tremendous
[1:04:29] God bless you yeah
[1:04:41] Hermanos
[1:04:50] Superstore
[1:04:55] foreign
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:03] how many Davids are here
[1:05:07] I don't hear too many Davids
[1:05:13] I hear a lot of Davis when they say that
[1:05:16] David Cook
[1:05:18] but when they say that David failed
[1:05:23] then no one says
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:30] where none of us are exempt to
[1:05:33] sinus
[1:05:35] here this verse it says in seconds
[1:05:39] this is when it came to pass after
[1:05:41] Europeans
[1:05:43] at the times when kings go forth to
[1:05:46] battle estamos hablando we're talking
[1:05:49] about David and look the scripture says
[1:05:56] that it was during the time that the
[1:05:58] Kings go to bed
[1:06:00] now this gives to me
[1:06:03] is that there's a Time
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:19] it wasn't the correct time
[1:06:22] and there's sometimes that we also
[1:06:25] we're thinking
[1:06:28] that it's time foreign
[1:07:27] and
[1:07:31] we hear it
[1:07:50] nothing moves you
[1:07:54] because you have cold it's cold because
[1:07:57] you haven't guarded yourself because
[1:08:00] you've made yourself into a routine
[1:08:04] you lost your focus routine
[1:08:11] the focus is love
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:18] so we lose our Focus for why we do
[1:08:20] things yeah we come to church
[1:08:26] there we lose our focus
[1:08:29] and we no longer know why we come
[1:08:32] you will come to see a good preaching
[1:08:37] I want to see God on the scene
[1:08:40] yeah
[1:08:41] I got so tired
[1:08:43] I'm just playing church
[1:08:46] because we can play Church all the time
[1:08:52] wanna see God
[1:08:56] honestly God on the scene
[1:09:01] let the sick be healed
[1:09:04] because the gospel that
[1:09:07] is the gospel we die for
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:13] and there David was
[1:09:22] he was kept unguarded he let his guard
[1:09:24] down
[1:09:26] they say
[1:09:28] yes
[1:09:33] that David got up from his bed and went
[1:09:35] walked on the roof of the Royal House
[1:09:40] and he began to take a little stroll
[1:09:45] when he had to be on the front lines in
[1:09:48] battle
[1:09:49] and many times we here Brothers
[1:09:53] we have to be in the front lines of the
[1:09:56] battle
[1:09:57] and we send their brother to the front
[1:10:00] instead
[1:10:01] let the brothers and sisters
[1:10:04] and we're there at home
[1:10:08] I didn't feel like coming to church
[1:10:10] today
[1:10:12] nothing's gonna happen
[1:10:15] the devil is like humidity
[1:10:19] by little by little he starts working
[1:10:22] and he's going to begin to call you
[1:10:26] David was
[1:10:28] he was relaxed in his bed
[1:10:33] and Uriah tells him my Lord
[1:10:38] how do you think
[1:10:44] Meanwhile my brothers are in a bottle
[1:10:47] I don't know if that doesn't happen
[1:10:50] well their brothers are pushing us
[1:10:53] and many of us are sleeping
[1:10:57] we're not waiting on anything
[1:11:04] our Pastor said on Friday he said
[1:11:08] sometimes we think nothing is happening
[1:11:11] let me tell you something tonight if
[1:11:14] something is happening
[1:11:17] or you're gonna leave worse
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:33] sorry you know
[1:11:38] Psalm 51 says that David says that
[1:11:41] return to me the joy of my salvation and
[1:11:43] I was thinking I see that David
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:49] even though what had happened
[1:11:53] he was already he was dragging something
[1:11:55] priorities
[1:11:58] because you're not going to lose the joy
[1:12:00] of yourself
[1:12:02] not over a sin
[1:12:04] remember one thing would lead you to
[1:12:07] another yeah
[1:12:09] it'll lead you to another
[1:12:21] the message considering our path
[1:12:26] perhaps you had a real experience in
[1:12:28] your heart this is for me Brothers
[1:12:38] and your heart burned after having
[1:12:40] received the Holy Spirit in your life
[1:12:42] there David was who knows
[1:12:45] a couple verses
[1:12:49] he fought
[1:12:51] against the Giant
[1:12:55] all right
[1:12:58] we begin to hear the gospel
[1:13:02] we begin to hear over Jesus
[1:13:05] who is with his hands
[1:13:08] that loves us with all of his hearts
[1:13:18] and it comes to the point
[1:13:21] that you lose your focus
[1:13:28] it comes to the point of your house
[1:13:36] but when you lose
[1:13:40] when you don't no longer dedicate
[1:13:43] we no longer dedicate
[1:13:46] when you don't hear her
[1:13:49] she doesn't hear you yeah you guys don't
[1:13:52] hear one of them
[1:13:54] you begin to fall on the routine daily a
[1:13:57] daily routine
[1:14:00] and you lose at the essence of it
[1:14:04] because we get into a routine
[1:14:07] and that's how we are in church
[1:14:10] wow
[1:14:12] [Music]
[1:14:15] he said
[1:14:18] he says but one way or another you got
[1:14:20] away from him
[1:14:23] the ones that get away are us
[1:14:27] he never sets himself apart from us
[1:14:33] it doesn't matter
[1:14:38] it doesn't it doesn't matter that he'd
[1:14:40] fallen so much
[1:14:42] maybe he felt so bad
[1:14:45] I don't know if you sin but I have but
[1:14:48] when you say yeah
[1:14:54] something's not right within me I failed
[1:14:57] you said my loved ones
[1:15:04] there is something in your heart yeah
[1:15:16] he told him
[1:15:19] that's what that's what um
[1:15:30] but within yourself
[1:15:33] you can say Lord or you'll say Lord
[1:15:37] forgive me
[1:15:43] I don't deserve yourself I think I don't
[1:15:47] deserve your mercies oh Lord
[1:15:51] forgive me once more
[1:15:58] maybe you didn't dedicate the adequate
[1:16:01] amount of time
[1:16:03] to be in communication with your lord
[1:16:07] maybe you dedicated more time to
[1:16:09] Facebook
[1:16:10] or Instagram
[1:16:18] let me tell you there's something that
[1:16:21] feels you more than that and it's the
[1:16:23] word of God
[1:16:24] when you grab it
[1:16:26] you take it and you put it inside of
[1:16:30] your heart
[1:16:31] and he begins to work in your life
[1:16:44] but sometimes we get into a stage of
[1:16:47] routine
[1:16:48] and it's a very stubborn routine or
[1:16:52] stage
[1:17:06] he says that the doctor discovered in my
[1:17:09] lungs I had two blacks Pumas I asked him
[1:17:12] do you smoke he said oh this is he said
[1:17:14] oh yeah I do smoke
[1:17:16] and I told him why don't you stop
[1:17:18] smoking why don't you
[1:17:36] but it's the same thing with the Devil
[1:17:42] it's the same thing in the spirit
[1:17:47] we're seeing that that's gonna kill us
[1:17:51] that it's separation
[1:17:56] and David okay
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:02] and he seen that he was insane
[1:18:07] all right
[1:18:15] closing with this Fresno I shared this
[1:18:18] in Fresno
[1:18:19] hello
[1:18:21] hate versus love
[1:18:26] forgive me Brothers but this is what
[1:18:28] God's place in my heart
[1:18:31] this is what God has given me
[1:18:35] when I hear the prophet that he says
[1:18:38] that the messenger them his message are
[1:18:40] won
[1:18:43] me
[1:18:57] have I truly lost that love
[1:19:00] Lord forgive me I tell him
[1:19:04] have I lost the love for your children
[1:19:07] oh brother
[1:19:11] and I say Lord
[1:19:15] don't allow for that to get into my
[1:19:18] heart
