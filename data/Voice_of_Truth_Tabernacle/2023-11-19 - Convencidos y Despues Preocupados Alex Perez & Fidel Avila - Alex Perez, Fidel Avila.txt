day oh I live oh I a new song and [Music] of I I could never be open up your in the book of St John chapter 1 be reading from verse 31 and on God bless everyone here in this place if there's someone here it's the first time here may God bless you the theme that we're taking on Sundays fighting for the souls and along with my brother Fel chosen the subtitle that we've titled convinced and then worried scripture you can say Amen we can begin reading John chapter 1 verse 3 31 the scripture says like this verse 32 says and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode upon him and I knew him not but he that s me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record that this is is the Son of God again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him and heard him speak and they followed Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Master where dwellest thou he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the 10th hour one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ the bless word you may be seated John the Baptist a couple days before he had experienced the greatest Revelation he had had in his life God had prepared him for 30 years to use him for six months God had given him a an experience that was Unforgettable to be able to introduce the Messiah to be able to see that great Revelation the Holy Ghost come down as a dove and to rest upon him it was a marvelous time for John he had fulfilled his purpose John was so happy that he knew within himself that he had fulfilled his calling for which God had called him when John was here on Earth he had followers people followed John and amongst that Gathering of followers that John had there were two disciples there as the Bible narrates one of them was Andrew and brother Bram says that the other one was Phillip and they followed John the Baptist and and they in fact were present when John has this great Revelation and he says Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world they were there they were present but as the Revelation was not for them the Revelation was for John and that captures my attention that every man every woman has to have their experience personal experience brother brandham says convinced then concerned uh speaking of that experience John had nobody else saw it but John just think of [Music] that the Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dust and rested Upon Jesus and nobody saw but John because the promise was made to John so then we see a man named John the Baptist who has his Revelation who has his experience he had seen the Messiah recognized who the Messiah was but there were two disciples that wanted their own experience as well and I want to tell you this morning that you and I we can't live on the revelation of someone else I can't live on my pastor's Revelation I can't live on the revelation of someone else I need an experience a firsthand experience brother Bram says we don't want a a religion is second-handed no brothers I don't want a religion I don't want to live in church just because they tell me just because they tell me that Jesus died for me that God sent a prophet in my time I need you need to make sure to be convinced that this is for you something that somebody else has experienced brother Bram says John the Baptist had had his Revelation his experience but there were two disciples that they stayed with that they had that curiosity is that man named Jesus if this morning there' be people this morning that say I want to have my own experience I need to know this man named Jesus brother Bram continues saying and we are living off of their testimony we said a couple weeks back speaking on the Apostle PA that he came with the testimony of God came and spoke of that testim he came and said what God had done God had sent Jesus to Die For Humanity it was a testimony John had spoken of the testimony that he had experienced there was a man named andreww needed his own experience his own experience his own testimony we can't live on the experience of our brother this takes me to think on Andrew you know that Andrew was the first disciple of Jesus registered here in the Bible it shows that he was one of the first that follow Jesus and it catches my attention how these two disciples they asked Jesus where do you dwell there was a certain curiosity in them they wanted to know more about Jesus the world wants to know more about Jesus that I don't have the time nor the uh do I put in the effort to show more of Jesus we said a couple weeks back that the people they just don't want to just hear they don't want to just hear words we have to take him out of history and present him now and days and in the mind of Andrew there was that Curiosity that little that little Splinter and it's uh beautiful when a person follow in advance and what they truly feel in their heart I tell every one of you if you have the desire to seek more of God then do it don't let anything stop you don't let anything hold you back don't hold yourself back don't worry about how you're going to come Church speak to a people that knows come you're welcome there are words of life there are words that we want to share with you on behalf of God that God still wants to deal with us this takes me to What My Title is I realized that Andrew was a person that had to be convinced so that he could later so that he could later be worried you see I was looking a little bit I seen I was looking what kind of worries do people have for this new upcoming year and one of the worries if you allow me the people that are running for the presidency they're worried that the people are going to believe and they can make a great case people can say that's going to be my president people are worried to be able to find the way in which the people might believe and that they'll vote for them there are people that are worried about the economy what's going to happen what's going to happen is going to go up down there is a lot of worry that that is upcoming there's a YouTuber there youth here you'll understand me he is so worried that his ratings are for his ratings to go up that he's willing to do anything any dumb thing for the people to say wow he is worried to gain a a a greater following this is the time that we're living there is worries but for the things that don't aren't important as our pastor things that are in fact dead at the end of it all they are death there are fathers head of families that don't know what to do with their kids that's one of the worries their are fathers and mothers that they don't know what to do they're worried there are families that are on the brink of divorce and they're thinking who's going to stay with the house and who's going to have the car if you look up uh worries of 2024 that they show up on Google people need to hear a person that is convinced of what they're believing I asked myself am I truly convinced because you know what church the truth of the matter is that they don't believe truly not convinced Tru believe we're confessing and this left me a little stumbling a little bit people are worrying so much about many things I remember the story of Jesus when he was 12 years old his parents were worried because they couldn't find him and you know what the thing that you worry about is what's moving you what worries you if it worries you to pay the bills then I'm going to make sure that I have a good job this the time that we're living in you that's what's going to move you that's why we can't rescue a soul because perhaps they don't and I want to tell you this morning we have to be conv came for a soul it was open to us from the beginning the pastor told us more than 10,000 worlds we have to go in and capture that Vision there's a purpose for on a but to fulfill a purpose hallelujah hallelujah you find Jesus and they tell him they find Jesus and he tells us I'm just kind of summarizing what happened Jesus we were so in anguish we have days looking for you and Jesus responds to them and he tells them did you not did you not know that it's necessary for me to be in my father's business I believe brothers that we're getting to the time where we have to find out what truly matters to us I ask you this morning what moves you what moves me I stayed here in worries because people are worrying about so many things right now what church I've realized that nothing can fill us nothing brings more happiness to my soul truly church then when I see a person who is lost and comes to the feet of Jesus yes brothers because that brings me to understand that God is still working he says it's convenient or I must be in my father's business and I realize Andrew had to convince I imagine what Jesus told amongst throughout that whole night to take him to the point that when he comes out Jesus was staying dwelling what he first does is he goes and finds his brother look there is something that happens I believe that there is something that happens when you truly believe something when you truly believe something you're not easily moved and I I begin to think about a lot of people that say that they believe something that they believe the message that they believe this but later on they're not there anymore and I asked myself Tru had a conviction they had something that really anchored them and I say no no perhaps it can't be because when you believe something when you're convinced of you can't stay quiet you can't stay quiet you have to speak you have to share it it doesn't matter yes I believe you no I don't the world is looking for people that believes what they what is being confessed the pastor told us something in the back room there and it's true sometimes we believe more of a lie because they present it in a way that it's the truth and we that have a great truth they convince us just by a little bit Andre Andrew did the same as Paul like we said the previous time the last time Paul went to Arabia Arab to search if his experience was true do you remember and and Andrew he did the same he went with Jesus and he made sure he had to be convinced that that was the truth when you're convinced then you begin to talk to people as our brother Fel comes forward I'd like to just leave you with this with this thought brother Bram says now Andrew became very very concerned because he stayed with him all night and was convinced hallelujah hallelujah and then when he became convinced that he was the [Music] Christ then he was concerned about somebody else I could stop worried and it's fine we're worried about ourselves amen how tremendous and I believe that every man every woman every boy or girl that ever stays long enough that you're convinced we don't stay long enough reation down and we leave oh hallelujah hallelujah and to be convinced that it is right and that the Holy G so hard heart something happens in your heart Revelation com and you're the Holy Ghost Ming burning your heart that you can't stand still and let these people die like this in shame and sin my prayer is that we be convinced first and foremost worry about the lost souls God bless [Applause] you God bless you if it's for him give it even stronger than [Applause] that convinced and then worried we give thanks unto our pastor for the confidence and before talking on what God has placed in our hearts forgive me I there's sometimes sometimes we preach like when the when the test that comes to test your faith that's where it's it's tested because we can preach we can talk you can preach to someone but when the test or problem where your faith has to be tested my faith has to be I have to show you got to show and who or what you have truly convinced in what you have believed it's all right what the sister or brother have believed that's all right brother brother beautiful but the most important thing this morning is yours your soul if you're convinced the devil's trying to convince you the devil's trying to fight for your soul he's not going to stop he's fighting 247 trying to convince you he wants he wants you to go with him in this morning what has convinced you that's the question we must ask ourselves what's con what's conquered us what's made us fall in love graas thank you thank you to our pastor to be behind his pulpit and thank you to each and every one of you who is praying for the family it's not easy it's difficult times I didn't want to come to preach like humans we have feelings because the why does the person cry the scriptures teaches me when Jesus Christ saw Lazarus that the scriptures says there's nothing wrong with that but now the question is what has convinced us you know I believe for you to fall in love with something you have to be convinced you want to know why I'm here I could have been anywhere else you want to know why I'm stand because I've been convinced and what I what I preach what I preach I have to live it and I can't live out there it's nice living out there but here with us go God has made me follow with him you know he's convinced me I was thinking how many times the devil hasn't tried to kill me and I was remembering that the devil has tried to kill me many times but he still hasn't yet because he hasn't been given the permission but I been I started to think and think of how many times the devil has tried to kill me and you start to think how many times the devil has tried to kill you I was thinking when I was a young boyx in Mexico one time a donkey dragged me I was a little boy and I wanted to stop the donkey and the donkey was with a rope around his neck and an innocent little boy try to stop I want to stop the donkey and the Rope was hanging down I don't know how but the the the cord around leg and took me and he took me downhill a donkey had didn't have brakes it was on and it was on rocks on a steep hill I don't know what happened but that rope was made loose from my leg I believe it was the angel of the Lord right there was watching over me in another occasion I was drowned in the sea in another occasion I almost drowned in the river in another occasion in the hurricane where my father passed away a week before before my father passed away I went to go live with my grandmother and the hurricane and my father passed away God was taking care of me was God was convincing me even though what's inside the Bible it's true it has to come to life has to come into reality this life has to come into reality in my life this what the gospel has to come into reality in our life in another occasion the devil trying to kill us with my uncle my uncle the one that passed away last night the devil tried to kill me in the desert but my God had something planned for me things didn't end there now in this morning you may be going through problems you maybe go through problems in your marriage you can be go through family problem maybe in a job you're worried but in this morning I believe with all my heart because there's balm here brother no no it's not me it's his word he promised it and he will fulfill it as darkest things may get your life may get as much as the devil tried to kill you car and spiritually God still hasn't given him permission because God is still trying to convince you he tries to convince you in one occasion there was a woman a woman with a blood issue she wanted to touch the mantle cuz she knew she was convinced there was no doubt in her heart that if she touched the border of his m simply by touching it she would be healed and she accomplished it simply she touched the border of his mantle in another occasion there was a damsel SC says she was from this from a place called Samaria this woman surprises me shocks the Samaritan woman gets me a little bit crazy there's things I don't understand like our pastor a while ago told there's things that we're not going to completely understand there's things that I'm not going to understand I don't understand why my God took my uncle at 56 years old full of life his heart was young that's why he he lasted so long in agony because his heart was young and this woman this captures my attention the the Lord Jesus Christ said to the disciples go through don't go through Samaritan ways don't go he said to them he said don't go but then it say oh it's necessary for me it's necessary for me to pass by our Pastor said he wanted to go personally and in this morning he wants to convince you personally he doesn't want you to have a second he wants you to be convinced by himself that he wants to convince you you know my uncle he preached to me he lived me the grace of God we were able to work with him and I'm happy for that but you know one thing he is a in a better place he's in a better place he's no longer in pain with that cancer that he had he's no longer suffering but things don't just stay there Brothers this gospel what he preached to me what he liveed to me I had to bring it to manifestation CU what I can't live it's not only what's preached over there it goes to the it has to come to you take it take it in your heart grab all to it on your heart with all your strength and then an experience come to your life and then you may say no longer do I live but Christ livees within me for me to die is a not not anybody could say that when you're certain when we're convinced but many times we come to church we're falling asleep you want to know why because many things haven't been made real to us the time comes when things come to reality we speak of death and we say we're going towards it but when it comes to reality when when you find it or face it face to face when you find it face to face many of us are healthy thanks be to God when death comes to reality in your life it's better yet you be convinced today is the day if you're not convinced that you have the Holy Spirit brother today is the day that you can't come and take it what hinders you what hinders you that you take of the Holy Spirit what hind you if the word says that he shall provide the holy spirit for us what hinders the word is not the problem in that I'm still not in fullness brother Bram says this now you you cannot match the enemy I'm gonna read you another quote look look he says you know I believe the holy spirit is speaking something to us here because many of us aren't still convinced we're convinced of many other things many other we're many we're convinced of many other things but we're convinced of the incorrect things and brother Fidel you say why do you say that because we're we're we're read letters written letters you may deceive the brother or sister but look there's a spirit within you which happens to be this the conscience as well the day that you depart from here that that Spirit goes back to the father but that same Spirit be in the conscience the day of judgment will come and will come and expose all things to you those that's for those that have died without Christ in their hearts that's for those that are still not yet convinced but if in this morning you're convinced and you know in your heart you're rooted like when the storms come and that boat that has that anchor well anchored deep deep as high go to the left and to the right the devil shakes them from left to right tears down trees way but this boat shall remain your boat shall remain because you've been convinced the prophet says you know what what I believe I I believe that people are not convinced that Jesus is coming soon oh that hit me God hit me right there I believe that people are are not convinced that he's coming in this age we say oh yes especially when we're young oh I'm 16 I was 16 now I'm 40 and brother blast says Santo what are we doing with our time time is running out well we l we we least expected our hair is falling out hair coming out our body's hurting now what are we doing with our time brother brandham says I do not believe that they are convinced that he is coming in this age I think that is why they are not worried because they are not completely convinced correct they are not convinced of why he is with them if they were they would return to his word please stand brother Bram says there another quote you cannot match the enemy I can't match myself but I remember I'm living under a promise you maybe not be able to win the devil in many battles maybe the devil's gonna beat you in many battles we see Samson Satan defeated him Satan defeated him in many that the devil defeated many of the children of but they were convinced that there was a promise now in us there is a promise that there's a resurrection although these bodies May diminish he will speak the voice and you and I we'll get up we'll rise up again we'll be able to see other we'll be walk we we shouldn't fear we should be strong and be convinced in this morning of what you and I have believed if you're not convinced don't leave don't leave this place don't leave without Jesus Christ in your heart don't leave because when you're in the in the bed of death that's hard Brothers how many times have we not said nothing happens to me when would I imagine that this would happen but it came into reality you this body it's not Eternal your soul if it be predestined ET is eternal let us pray father Lord I give you thanks Lord CU we can rest there's only Rest In You Lord thank you Lord for convincing us thank you for convincing me that you are real if there could be someone in this morning Lord that hasn't accepted you as their savior as their lord as their red as they're all if there be someone here may they be able to express from the depth of their heart that without you there's nowhere else to go there's no other way other place to rest but other than you I put and if there's
