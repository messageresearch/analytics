[1:08] But the [música] six saints doesn't see
[1:10] that at all.
[1:11] It's so far beyond it. It's so much
[1:15] higher than it is
[1:17] until it don't even have any reasons at
[1:20] all with it. We believe it
[1:25] beyond anything that the five senses
[1:28] would have to say about it.
[1:32] Get ready for a healing service.
[1:35] See, we believe it. You walk by that
[1:40] six.
[1:42] You talk that six sense. You live that
[1:46] six sense.
[1:49] You die that six sense and r that six
[1:53] sense that super sense
[1:56] something that's in you that's different
[1:58] from what the natural man is. The
[2:01] natural man only has these and they're
[2:03] all right.
[2:06] submission saints.
[2:09] If the natural mind says reads the word
[2:11] of God and says that is the word of God
[2:14] is speaking the truth. But if it reads
[2:16] and say it's not all the word of God or
[2:18] or it's was something it was one time
[2:21] but it isn't now then that six sense
[2:23] comes in and says he's the same
[2:25] yesterday today and forever. Amen.
[2:29] That's the difference.
[2:32] That's why that so many people fail to
[2:34] be healed.
[2:37] They're trying to come with an
[2:40] intellectual conception.
[2:42] They say, "Oh, I do this or I believe
[2:47] this and so forth." But if that six
[2:50] sense is saying that, then there's
[2:52] nothing ever shake them from that six.
[2:58] The six sense is come upon the human
[3:02] being to make them deny anything that's
[3:05] contrary to the word of God.
[3:08] Any symptom,
[3:11] any symptom that's contrary to God's
[3:13] promise, the sick sense is mad.
[3:20] If the Christian that's barned again,
[3:23] and the first thing, you know, some
[3:25] infidel, unbeliever gets around to the
[3:27] Christian and said, "Now look at here,
[3:30] there's no such a thing as that Holy
[3:31] Ghost. You're just mistaken in that.
[3:34] You're crazy if you believe such as
[3:36] that. There's no such a thing as it.
[3:39] That sense goes right straight to
[3:43] let me show you in the Bible where you
[3:45] can't receive the Holy Ghost. You see I
[3:47] can show here where the disciples uh got
[3:50] it. But uh but well you say look at the
[3:53] six of you say but he said the promise
[3:55] isn't to you to your children. Well that
[3:57] meant their children there mean for you.
[4:00] It isn't for you but that sense knows
[4:02] better.
[4:03] Why it's already in you?
[4:06] They said it too late. You've already
[4:09] received it.
[4:13] People who talked through is no such a
[4:15] thing as the Holy Spirit. don't know
[4:17] what they're talking about.
[4:20] Like a boy once being an apple and was
[4:23] asked about infidel debating a meeting.
[4:27] He said, "What do you want? What do you
[4:29] want up here?" He said, "I want to ask
[4:30] you a question."
[4:31] while he was eating the apple and
[4:33] enjoying it. A very simple sort of look
[4:36] like a delinquent person with the hair
[4:39] hanging in his face and one tooth out in
[4:42] front an old dirty overhaul jacket. He
[4:45] said just one question I want to ask
[4:47] you. The infidologist said there is no
[4:50] such a thing as gone. It's all emotions.
[4:54] There's nonsense to it. Is all it is and
[4:57] the voice said I want to ask you a
[4:59] question. Is this apple sweet sour?
[5:03] He said I know I'm not eating it. He
[5:05] said that's just what I thought. Walk
[5:08] right that back. How do you know when
[5:10] you haven't tasted the Lord? How do you
[5:13] know when you've never received the Holy
[5:15] Ghost whether he's real or whether he is
[5:17] not?
[5:19] How do you know where there's faith and
[5:20] power? How do you know there's not joy
[5:23] unspeakable and full of glory when
[5:25] you've never tasted the sin?
[5:29] The six sense leads you to that. The six
[5:32] sense declares that to you. There's no
[5:35] intellectual powers at all ever bring
[5:37] that to you. The intellectual powers
[5:40] will reason and say psychology. It's
[5:42] something this way. It's emotion with
[5:44] the people. But when the six sense comes
[5:47] in, it denies all of those things and
[5:50] moves the person straight into the
[5:52] wisoms of God.
[5:54] He that come to God must believe that he
[5:56] is and a reward of those that diligently
[5:59] seek him.
[6:01] By faith, by faith.
[6:04] Abraham by faith. Isaac by faith, Jacob.
[6:08] All by faith.
[6:11] It's a six sense that does it. Six sense
[6:15] denies all symptoms, anything contrary
[6:19] to God's word, any feeling, emotion.
[6:23] Somebody say, "Oh, well, I was prayed
[6:25] far, but I just don't feel any better.
[6:30] Six would never stand still for that.
[6:35] Six and say it's a
[6:38] feel better. I'm getting well.
[6:41] God said so that
[6:45] amen
[6:48] God said so. Six only feeds on the word
[6:51] of God. That's super sense. It's super
[6:54] above the senses. It's a greater sense.
[6:58] It's a faith. It's a power that stars
[7:02] and
[7:07] it's something makes you do things that
[7:09] you never thought you would do.
[7:12] It's the six, the super sense. You get
[7:16] prayed for say you got a criple hand,
[7:18] you get prayed for your hand. You come
[7:21] up there and you believe that God's
[7:22] going to heal you. The pastor prays for
[7:24] you. You go back. The old natural man
[7:27] will say this. You don't feel any
[7:29] different in that hand. You're no better
[7:31] than what you ever was. But the six
[7:33] sense comes along and said that's
[7:37] you've been prayed for. That settles it.
[7:42] Amen. Like a woman come to a meeting one
[7:45] time and she come to her meeting two of
[7:47] them. They cross the platform. They seen
[7:50] the desernments.
[7:52] Them women were just
[7:54] swall up. They were both real
[7:57] Christians.
[7:59] One come up in the spirit time and said,
[8:03] "You are suffering with a stomach
[8:05] trouble."
[8:07] And her face lit up. She said, "That's
[8:10] true."
[8:12] Uh, and the Holy Spirit said through me
[8:14] said, "And it's an aler. It's caused
[8:17] from a nervous condition. You've been
[8:20] examined by a certain doctor and he said
[8:22] that you could not have that I had to
[8:25] have an operation have it cut out. She
[8:28] said every word of that is a truth. Then
[8:31] seen she's such a great believer and it
[8:34] said your name is Miss So and so you
[8:36] come from so and so and such and such a
[8:38] place. She said that is the truth.
[8:43] What was it the six catching it?
[8:47] The six and the Holy Spirit was standing
[8:49] side by side.
[8:51] The Holy Spirit was speaking the six
[8:53] saying amen. There it is. Something has
[8:56] to happen.
[9:01] When Martha run out to find Jesus
[9:06] and when she said, "Lord, what's the six
[9:09] sense?
[9:11] If thou would have been here, my brother
[9:12] would not have died.
[9:14] But even now, whatever you ask God, God
[9:17] will give it to you.
[9:20] There's a six sense.
[9:22] Jesus pulled himself together said, I am
[9:25] the resurrection life. He that believing
[9:28] in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
[9:31] live. Amen.
[9:34] Whoever and believeth in me, shall never
[9:36] die. Believe thou this. What are you
[9:39] going to say? reasoning there's a man
[9:41] leing out of dead and the worms is
[9:43] crawing through him but he's just got
[9:46] through saying he was the resurrection
[9:48] and the life that's god's word
[9:53] six sense beyond the doctor's care
[9:56] beyond the thoughts of scientific
[9:58] research they found they find all
[10:01] reasonings and c them down
[10:05] it's witnessing to god's word i am and i
[10:09] will I was I am now the resurrection of
[10:13] life.
[10:15] Amen. He that believeth in me though he
[10:18] were dead yet he shall live and whosover
[10:21] livet and believe it in me shall never
[10:23] die. Believe thou this. He said Lord six
[10:29] I believe that you are the son of God
[10:31] that should come into the world.
[10:39] Oh.
[10:40] Oh my
[10:50] god.
[10:57] Super sense was God. There was something
[10:59] telling Martha that she seen him, she
[11:02] know him. She recognized him to be the
[11:05] very Messiah. And she know if she could
[11:08] only get to him, if she could only get
[11:11] close to him and present the case.
[11:16] Just hear one promise come from him.
[11:18] That's all she wanted
[11:21] when he said, "I am the resurrection
[11:23] life. He that believe it in me though he
[11:26] were dead." That's all Martha want to
[11:28] hear.
[11:30] All she wanted because the six sense the
[11:33] super sense her faith was moving her to
[11:35] confessing
[11:39] this woman when she left the platform it
[11:42] was say the Lord go home and eat Jesus
[11:47] Christ makes you well
[11:51] she went home
[11:53] that night a friend of hers living in
[11:56] the neighborhood was third or fourth
[11:58] behind
[11:59] She had a big knot on her neck
[12:03] and here she come all trilled about her
[12:08] neighbor was going to be healed that
[12:10] bothered her so much. This is one of the
[12:13] hundreds of cases, thousands of them.
[12:16] And this big knot sticking out on her
[12:17] neck and she come up. I said, "No one
[12:20] would have to desern that."
[12:23] But you're happy about something. You've
[12:25] been thrilled because that woman setting
[12:27] over yonder is a neighbor of yours. Holy
[12:31] Spirit, she thought, how in the world
[12:33] could that man know that? It has to be
[12:36] something to reveal it to me.
[12:40] When that was said, it said you're
[12:42] thinking about the

[31:38] mundo no me verá.
[31:41] Más vosotros me veréis,
[31:43] porque yo estaré con vosotros
[31:47] y en vosotros.
[31:49] Y yo creo que estamos ciertos de que
[31:51] Dios es el que nos habla.
[31:54] [música]
[31:55] Estamos ciertos que Dios es el que va a
[31:58] traer su palabra
[32:00] porque a nosotros no nos cuesta trabajo
[32:02] creer que es Dios en carne. [música]
[32:08] Nuestro hermano Eduardo Beltrán,
[32:10] interpreter,
[32:13] grande es el [música] amor de Dios.

[36:29] [música]
[36:36] Señor los bendiga en esta noche.
[36:38] [música]
[36:42] Es un privilegio muy grande poder estar
[36:44] en la casa del Señor.
[36:49] Creo que estamos
[36:51] muy felices, ¿verdad?
[36:53] Yo estoy muy feliz
[36:57] de poder estar aquí, poder adorar al
[36:59] nombre del Señor Jesucristo.
[37:05] Abran conmigo. Tengo unas escrituras. La
[37:08] primera está en Génesis 18
[37:22] y luego vamos a pasarnos a San Lucas,
[37:25] capítulo 1,
[37:28] verso 37 y 38.
[37:34] Dice Génesis 18:14,
[37:41] es una pregunta,
[37:44] dice, "¿Hay para Dios alguna cosa
[37:48] difícil?"
[37:57] Y Lucas 137
[38:00] y 38 dice así.
[38:08] dice, "Porque nada hay imposible para
[38:12] Dios."
[38:16] Entonces María dijo, "He aquí la sierva
[38:19] del Señor,
[38:23] hágase conmigo conforme a tu palabra."
[38:29] Y Hebreos 138,
[38:33] Jesucristo es el mismo de ayer,
[38:37] hoy y por los siglos.
[38:43] Pueden tomar sus asientos, hermanos.
[38:49] Dios nos ha estado hablando
[38:54] bastante a través de esta semana de
[38:56] servicios.
[39:01] Hemos tenido como un buffet
[39:06] una variedad,
[39:11] una variedad, hermano.
[39:13] El primer tema que se nos predicó,
[39:18] la fe perfectamente posicionada.
[39:25] Ahí nos empezó el Señor.
[39:28] El segundo tema,
[39:30] ¿habrá algo difícil para Dios?
[39:37] Luego el tercer tema, el cuarto tema,
[39:42] todo o nada.
[39:45] Amén.
[39:46] Luego
[39:48] nos predicaron dejándolo todo para
[39:52] recibir
[39:57] y el domingo
[40:00] no una visita, una morada.
[40:07] Y ayer,
[40:09] pero Dios.
[40:11] Am.
[40:13] Entonces, Dios nos ha bendecido en
[40:15] grande manera a través de todos estos
[40:17] días.
[40:21] Hemos tenido bastante palabra
[40:24] y en esta noche
[40:27] Dios me guió a quedarme con el tema
[40:29] exactamente como el Espíritu Santo se lo
[40:32] dio al pastor.
[40:38] El Dios de lo imposible.
[40:43] el Dios de lo imposible.
[40:47] Y le voy a leer algunas cosas que él me
[40:49] inspiró mientras estaba ahí un día de
[40:51] estos.
[40:58] Él es el mismo que creó los cielos y la
[41:01] tierra.
[41:06] Él es el mismo que se llevó a Enoc
[41:08] cuando salió a caminar con él. En
[41:10] aquella tarde,
[41:14] él es el mismo que le dijo a Noé,
[41:17] "Construye un arca."
[41:21] Él es el mismo que llamó a Abraham y le
[41:23] dijo, "Sal de tu tierra y de tu
[41:25] parentela."
[41:30] Él es el mismo que le dijo a Jocabet que
[41:33] ese niño llamado Moisés era libertador.
[41:41] Él es el mismo que llamó a Moisés a
[41:43] través de la zarza.
[41:47] Él es el mismo que trajo las plagas en
[41:50] Egipto a través de Moisés.
[41:55] Él es el mismo que abrió el Mar Rojo a
[41:58] través de Moisés.
[42:01] Él es el mismo que trajo codornices para
[42:05] que comiera el pueblo de Israel.
[42:10] Él es el mismo que dio un carnero a
[42:12] Abraham para que no sacrificara a Isaac.
[42:18] Él es el mismo que abrió el Jordán en
[42:21] los días de Josué.
[42:25] Él es el mismo que derribó las murallas
[42:27] de Jericó.
[42:31] Él es el mismo que fortaleció a Sansón
[42:34] antes de morir, apoyado en las paredes
[42:37] del edificio filisteo.
[42:45] Él es el mismo que mató al gigante a
[42:48] través de David.
[42:52] Él es el mismo que sostuvo a Elías y a
[42:55] la viuda en tiempo de Ezequía.
[43:01] Él es el mismo que sanó a Naamán, el
[43:04] sirio.
[43:07] Él es el mismo que se llevó a Elías en
[43:09] carros de fuego y gente de caballo.
[43:18] Él es el mismo que estaba en Eliseo
[43:20] dando vida a través de sus huesos.
[43:26] Él es el mismo que que le dio un hijo a
[43:29] Ana llamado Samuel cuando no podía
[43:32] tenerlo.
[43:37] Él es el mismo que prometió al profeta
[43:40] Elías.
[43:43] Él es el mismo que liberó al endemoniado
[43:46] gadareno.
[43:50] Él es el mismo que expulsó siete
[43:52] demonios de María Magdalena.
[43:57] Él es el mismo que liberó a la mujer
[44:00] samaritana.
[44:03] Él es el mismo que dio la vista al ciego
[44:06] Bartimeo.
[44:09] Él es el mismo que resucitó a Lázaro
[44:12] cuando ya tenía 4 días de muerto.
[44:17] Él es el mismo que reprendió los vientos
[44:20] y callaron.
[44:24] Él es el mismo que resucitó al tercer
[44:27] día.
[44:30] Él es el mismo que llenó a los 120 en el
[44:33] día de Pentecostés.
[44:38] Él es el mismo que dio sanidad al cojo
[44:40] en el templo llamado la hermosa.
[44:46] Él es el mismo que trajo una orquesta
[44:48] del cielo a Policarpio antes de que lo
[44:50] quemaran.
[44:55] Él es el mismo que le dio al que le dijo
[44:57] al hermano Bradam, "Habla y di a la
[44:59] tormenta que se detenga aquí en
[45:01] Colorado."
[45:07] Es ese mismo que le dijo al hermano
[45:09] Bradam, "¿Cuántas ardillas quieres y
[45:11] dónde?"
[45:15] Él es el mismo que sanó al hombre que
[45:17] adoraba el sol allá en la India a través
[45:20] del hermano Brad sanó.
[45:25] Él es el mismo de mi pastor aquí
[45:27] presente.
[45:30] Él es mi Dios.
[45:34] Él es mi Dios.
[45:36] Él es nuestro Dios. Él es el mismo.
[45:41] Oh, bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[45:48] Todas esas cosas me da Dios por
[45:49] inspiración.
[45:55] Leímos Lucas
[45:59] 137 y 38
[46:03] y luego leímos Génesis.
[46:07] Vamos a tomar Lucas ahorita.
[46:11] Ya miramos que él es el mismo.
[46:14] Él es el mismo hoy, aquí, ahora.
[46:21] El hermano Bradam cuando predicó Jehová
[46:23] de los milagros,
[46:26] él tomó esas escrituras de Lucas,
[46:30] Lucas 136, 37 y 38 tomó.
[46:36] Y cuando predicó, "Hay algo imposible
[46:39] para Dios,
[46:43] tomó Génesis 18:14.
[46:50] Así es.
[46:53] Él cuenta Jehová de los milagros.
[46:58] El profeta cuenta
[47:00] que ellos habían, José y María
[47:04] habían ido al templo
[47:08] y habían escuchado un poderoso sermón
[47:11] del Rabí.
[47:14] El rabí había predicado
[47:18] que Dios antes había hecho muchas cosas
[47:21] poderosas.
[47:24] Él había llamado a Abraham.
[47:27] Él había traído pan del cielo.
[47:31] Él había traído codornices al pueblo de
[47:34] Israel.
[47:36] que él había hecho cosas poderosas,
[47:41] pero terminó diciendo, "Ese tiempo ya ha
[47:44] pasado."
[47:48] Y eso no desonó bien a José.
[47:51] Dijo José, "Yo creo que él arruinó su
[47:54] sermón
[47:56] al final cuando dijo,
[47:59] "Ese tiempo ya pasó.
[48:07] Todos los domingos
[48:10] leen, tienen estudios de la Biblia.
[48:14] Va María y toma el pergamino,
[48:18] se lo da a José para que lea
[48:22] y José se va a Isaías 96
[48:28] acerca del niño que es nacido.
[48:33] Cuando María escuchó,
[48:37] dice el profeta, ella suspiró.
[48:44] le dijo, "A ver, José cariño, léeme otra
[48:47] vez."
[48:52] Le leyó otra vez Isaías 96.
[48:57] ¿De qué está hablando aquí el profeta?
[49:01] Está diciendo que una mujer de las de
[49:03] nosotros tendrá al Mesías.
[49:09] Eso hizo sonrojar a María.
[49:13] Sus ojos se le pusieron brillosos.
[49:17] [aplausos]
[49:19] El lunes en la mañana
[49:22] ella iba rumbo al pozo,
[49:26] 100% pensando en esa escritura,
[49:30] pensando en esa palabra.
[49:33] ¿Quién irá a ser esa mujer?
[49:36] ¿Cómo irá a suceder este milagro?
[49:41] Ella iba en su camino, dice el profeta,
[49:45] no había nadie, solamente ella iba ida
[49:48] mirando para abajo, pensando, pensando
[49:51] en la escritura.
[49:55] De repente miró algo destellar,
[50:01] pensó, "Quizás algún metal brilló por
[50:05] acá.
[50:09] o algún casco romano,
[50:13] pero estaba 100% concentrada en esa
[50:16] escritura.
[50:22] Cuando de repente
[50:25] miró una luz ya más real,
[50:29] el gran Grabiel,
[50:32] salve.
[50:35] Salve,
[50:36] detente,
[50:38] muy favorecida,
[50:41] eres bendita entre todas las mujeres.
[50:49] Es correcto. Amén. Amén.
[50:53] piénselo.
[50:58] Hay algo, hermano, cuando uno piensa en
[51:01] la palabra,
[51:03] hay algo que lo magnetiza.
[51:07] Hay algo que Dios viene a la cena.
[51:13] [aplausos]
[51:14] Ella iba pensando en esa escritura
[51:18] sin pensar que ella era esa mujer
[51:23] que iba a producir ese gran milagro.
[51:31] Aleluya.
[51:34] Bendita tú eres.
[51:38] Tendrá, darás a luz un hijo y llamará su
[51:41] nombre Jesús.
[51:44] ¿Cómo sucederá esto?
[51:48] Puesto que yo no he conocido varón.
[51:52] El Espíritu Santo vendrá sobre ti y te
[51:55] hará sombra.
[52:00] Y ahí le repitió, le dijo, "Tu prima o
[52:03] tu parienta Elizabeth
[52:06] también está esperando."
[52:10] Dice el profeta Elizabeth, "Ya tenía 60
[52:13] años.
[52:15] Zacarías tenía 70 años
[52:19] y le dijo, "En la conversación el ángel
[52:24] le habló de Elizabeth
[52:27] y luego le dijo, porque no hay nada
[52:30] imposible para Dios."
[52:36] Y María dijo, "Hágase
[52:38] así como lo has dicho, así empezar.
[52:44] Entonces yo me preguntaba muchas veces
[52:50] a
[52:53] cuando se dio este tema,
[52:58] ¿qué tienen estos hijos de Dios
[53:02] que son así?
[53:06] Y me hice esa pregunta mucho, ¿qué
[53:08] tienen estos hijos de Dios?
[53:12] que son así.
[53:17] Y Dios me enseñó a mí
[53:20] que ellos en primer lugar creen en su
[53:23] Dios.
[53:26] En segundo lugar creen en ellos.
[53:32] En tercer lugar, creen en sus promesas.
[53:39] [aplausos]
[53:40] creen que es posible.
[53:42] Ellos lo creen,
[53:45] ellos se identifican con eso.
[53:49] Por eso lo creen y lo recibe.
[53:55] Oh, bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[54:00] Otra cosa, si lo quieres notar, ellos
[54:04] saben lo que quieren.
[54:08] Ellos saben lo que piden.
[54:12] Ellos saben por qué lo piden.
[54:16] Ellos saben por qué lo quieren.
[54:22] Oh, bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[54:25] Alabado sea el nombre del Señor en esta
[54:27] noche.
[54:30] Oh, aleluya,
[54:31] aleluya,
[54:32] aleluya, aleluya,
[54:34] aleluya,
[54:35] aleluya,
[54:36] aleluya.
[54:37] Hermano, voy a decir algo.
[54:44] Los hijos de Dios
[54:47] tenemos un potencial por dentro.
[54:54] Escuche esto. Los hijos de Dios tenemos
[54:56] un potencial por dentro.
[55:01] Somos hechos a la imagen de Dios.
[55:04] Somos hechos a la hechura de Dios.
[55:14] Hay un potencial por dentro.
[55:18] Amén.
[55:20] No deje que el lo engañe.
[55:24] No deje que el lo tenga atado.
[55:32] Hay un potencial dentro de nosotros
[55:36] que necesita ser activado.
[55:43] Muchas de las veces aún podemos estar
[55:45] aquí y no saber lo que Dios ha puesto
[55:49] dentro de nosotros.
[55:55] El profeta dijo,
[55:57] "Nosotros somos dioses aficionados,
[56:02] pequeños Mesías,
[56:04] Dios es junior.
[56:07] Somos pequeños creadores.
[56:11] No deje que el le mienta, no deje
[56:14] que el le engañe.
[56:17] su potencial de lo que él ha puesto
[56:20] dentro de usted.
[56:26] Oh, bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[56:33] ¿Cuántas veces decimos,
[56:37] "Estamos enfermos
[56:39] y es que Dios así me quiere tener."
[56:45] ¿Ha escuchado eso?
[56:48] Yo mismo lo he dicho,
[56:51] pero la revelación va en progreso.
[56:57] La revelación va en progreso porque él
[57:00] va creciendo dentro de nosotros.
[57:06] Cuando usted lee
[57:08] la restauración del árbol novia,
[57:11] dice el profeta, regrésele al
[57:15] todo lo que él ha traído sobre su vida.
[57:20] Usted tiene el poder para regresarle al
[57:22] lo que él ha traído sobre su
[57:24] vida.
[57:28] Hay cosas que no nos pertenecen a
[57:30] nosotros.
[57:32] Nosotros fuimos hechos para ser libres,
[57:37] fuimos hechos para traer cosas a
[57:39] existencia.
[57:45] No somos personitas [risas] cualquiera,
[57:46] hay pecadores, hay somos hijos de Dios.
[57:51] Somos hijos de Dios con un potencial
[57:54] grande que ha puesto dentro de nosotros.
[57:59] Aleluya.
[58:01] Así es. Oh, bendito sea el nombre del
[58:03] Señor.
[58:09] Qué grande es el Señor.
[58:18] Yo le decía al Señor,
[58:21] "Señor, yo quiero predicar de un Dios
[58:25] vivo,
[58:29] porque tú eres un Dios vivo.
[58:32] Tú a mí me has probado que eres un Dios
[58:35] vivo que trae cosas a existencia.
[58:43] No queremos venir a la iglesia no más a
[58:45] ver qué pasa. No, yo no quiero eso. Yo
[58:48] quiero ver un Dios vivo que me escucha,
[58:51] que me responde, que está conmigo. El
[58:55] Dios de milagros, el Dios poderoso.
[59:02] Oh, bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[59:12] en un abismo llamando a otro.
[59:16] Dice el profeta de Dios,
[59:20] dice,
[59:22] "Antes que hubiera un árbol,
[59:30] antes que hubiera un árbol,
[59:32] tenía que haber tierra
[59:35] donde estuviera ese árbol."
[59:38] Y Dios primero creó la tierra.
[59:42] Y la tierra estuvo llamando y llamando y
[59:45] llamando y llamando y llamando y
[59:47] llamando y llamando y llamando hasta que
[59:50] vino el árbol la existencia.
[59:57] Ponga todo lo que quiera que haya en la
[59:59] tierra. La tierra produjo todo lo que
[1:00:02] hay en la tierra.
[1:00:06] Dice, "Y estuvo llamando y llamando.
[1:00:08] Usted quiere un milagro. Usted quiere un
[1:00:11] milagro de verdad.
[1:00:13] [aplausos]
[1:00:14] Está en usted. Si hay un abismo que
[1:00:17] llama, hay un abismo que responde. Si
[1:00:20] usted quiere sanidad, hay un Dios que lo
[1:00:22] puede sanar.
[1:00:26] Amén. Amén.
[1:00:30] Oh, bendito sea el Señor.
[1:00:35] Si hay un alma clamando,
[1:00:38] hay un Dios que va a responder.
[1:00:41] Pero Dios me enseñaba
[1:00:44] que todo lo que él ha creado es
[1:00:45] sobrenatural
[1:00:48] y hay cosas que él ha hecho por nosotros
[1:00:51] aún cuando no andábamos muy bien.
[1:00:55] Pero hay cosas me enseñaba que él no las
[1:00:58] va a hacer hasta que esa persona se
[1:01:01] rinda completamente.
[1:01:06] Y me enseñó a Ana,
[1:01:09] ¿recuerdan a Ana?
[1:01:12] Ella se rindió completamente en el altar
[1:01:16] y trajo a existencia un hijo.
[1:01:21] [aplausos]
[1:01:24] Oh, bendito sea el Señor.
[1:01:26] me recordó a mí
[1:01:29] cuando yo tenía 30 y algo de años ya,
[1:01:37] él me recordó.
[1:01:41] ¿Te acordas cuando
[1:01:44] ya tenías tus años y te querías casar?
[1:01:52] Eso hace Dios.
[1:01:56] Yo describí una carta al Señor.
[1:02:00] Hermano, se han escrito muchas cartas.
[1:02:03] Crea que es posible.
[1:02:06] Crea que es posible.
[1:02:08] Tráigalo a existencia.
[1:02:12] [aplausos]
[1:02:13] Crea que es posible.
[1:02:15] ¿Por qué cree que le estoy recomendando
[1:02:17] a los hermanos el mensaje tu casa?
[1:02:21] No saliendo me entend porque a veces
[1:02:23] miramos perdida la cosa.
[1:02:26] No tenemos fe suficiente.
[1:02:28] Es posible.
[1:02:34] Yo le escribí al Señor una carta.
[1:02:38] Le dije, "Señor, ya quiero conocer a mi
[1:02:40] esposa.
[1:02:42] Porque yo sabía que si Dios tenía una
[1:02:44] para Adán,
[1:02:46] él tenía que tener una para mí.
[1:02:52] Y me decía, aunque me decía, "No, usted
[1:02:54] no se va a casar
[1:02:56] porque usted no va a los servicios
[1:02:57] especiales Arizona, porque usted no más
[1:03:00] se mantiene aquí en el tabernáculo."
[1:03:03] Y yo dije con mi boca, "Ella vendrá
[1:03:06] aquí. Yo no tengo que ir a buscar a
[1:03:08] nadie.
[1:03:13] [aplausos]
[1:03:13] Que sea un poco blanca, Señor.
[1:03:17] Que sea doncella, Señor.
[1:03:20] Sí, Señor. Lo digo.
[1:03:22] Es verdad.
[1:03:26] Es el Dios que nosotros tenemos,
[1:03:27] hermano.
[1:03:29] Este es el Dios que nosotros tenemos.
[1:03:32] Es un Dios vivo, es un Dios grande, es
[1:03:35] un Dios fuerte. Es un Dios poderoso. Es
[1:03:38] un Dios que trae cosas de existencia. Y
[1:03:41] usted también puede traer cosas de
[1:03:43] existencia.
[1:03:46] [aplausos]
[1:03:49] Es el Dios que nosotros tenemos.
[1:03:52] No andamos aquí no más hay culto tras
[1:03:55] culto, no más hay
[1:04:01] serio.
[1:04:04] Oh, bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[1:04:09] Es posible.
[1:04:16] Qué grande es él.
[1:04:21] Le dije, "Señor, antes que llegue, dame
[1:04:23] un carro."
[1:04:28] y me lo dio.
[1:04:30] Gracias al pastor que me dio donde
[1:04:32] tenerlo.
[1:04:35] Después le pedí otro carro, me lo dio.
[1:04:39] Cuando me casé no tenía mucho dinero,
[1:04:43] las llantas de mi carro
[1:04:46] estaban acabadas. Le dije, "Señor, enví
[1:04:48] a una persona con $2000.
[1:04:53] Yo necesito dinero.
[1:04:57] Llegó una persona, hermano. Esto es
[1:04:58] verdad. Mi esposa aquí está.
[1:05:03] Exactamente. 000 me llamó, me dijo,
[1:05:05] "¿Sabes qué? Te tengo una noticia.
[1:05:09] Ha llegado un sobre con 000.
[1:05:13] Es el Dios que nosotros tenemos.
[1:05:15] No deje que el te engañe.
[1:05:18] Crea en este Dios. Crea en este Dios.
[1:05:22] Crea en este Dios está vivo hoy, aquí
[1:05:25] ahora.
[1:05:32] Oh, bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[1:05:36] Hay algo dentro de los hijos de Dios que
[1:05:37] le dice que es posible.
[1:05:41] Hay así o no les pasa a ustedes que algo
[1:05:44] le dice que es posible,
[1:05:46] que es posible,
[1:05:48] que es posible. Hay algo que se afianza
[1:05:51] dentro de nosotros que nos dice que es
[1:05:53] posible,
[1:05:55] que la palabra de Dios es verdad.
[1:06:04] Oh, bendito sea el Señor.
[1:06:07] Nos regresamos a Génesis 18:14.
[1:06:13] Oh, bendito sea el Señor.
[1:06:16] Qué Dios que tenemos.
[1:06:20] ¿Qué Dios tenemos?
[1:06:23] Rechace su enfermedad,
[1:06:26] rechace todo eso que el ha
[1:06:28] traído. Devuélvase
[1:06:33] no le pertenece a usted.
[1:06:36] En Génesis 18:14,
[1:06:39] la escritura que leímos primero
[1:06:43] es muy tremendo.
[1:06:48] El profeta narra,
[1:06:51] en el caso hay algo imposible para Dios.
[1:06:57] Dice que
[1:06:59] Abraham estaba sentado
[1:07:02] en la puerta de su tienda.
[1:07:06] Escuche esto.
[1:07:10] Ya habían pasado 25
[1:07:13] años.
[1:07:15] Escuche,
[1:07:17] ya estaba completando casi los 100 años.
[1:07:22] Sara tenía 90 años.
[1:07:32] Y me gusta como el profeta lo dice,
[1:07:35] porque dice, él estaba esperando día a
[1:07:38] día,
[1:07:39] minuto a minuto,
[1:07:42] que él se le apareciera otra vez ya para
[1:07:45] confirmarle lo que le había prometido
[1:07:48] desde hace tiempo
[1:07:50] y él no iba a desaprovechar la
[1:07:52] oportunidad.
[1:07:54] Así es de Así es de que cuando Dios
[1:07:57] llegó
[1:07:59] con los otros ángeles, los otros se
[1:08:00] fueron para Sodoma, pero él hubo uno que
[1:08:03] se quedó,
[1:08:08] él inmediatamente le dijo, "Espéreme, mi
[1:08:10] señor, voy a ir, voy a prepararle algo
[1:08:12] de comer."
[1:08:17] Fue a traer un ternero, se lo dio al
[1:08:19] mayordomo para que lo preparara.
[1:08:22] Le dijo, "Sara, ese es el tiempo de
[1:08:24] nuestra visitación.
[1:08:29] Estaban comiendo, comieron.
[1:08:37] Sara estaba atrás de la tienda
[1:08:40] escuchando la conversación."
[1:08:43] Dice el profeta, "Ella tenía una actitud
[1:08:45] horrible, horrible, horrible.
[1:08:51] Porque en ese tiempo
[1:08:53] el pasto se había secado,
[1:08:56] las fuentes de las aguas se habían
[1:08:58] secado.
[1:09:00] Ella miró a la esposa de Lot
[1:09:04] una vez
[1:09:07] y miró que ella andaba bien arreglada y
[1:09:10] tenían todo
[1:09:12] y le había estado diciendo a Abraham,
[1:09:14] "Seguramente te equivocaste.
[1:09:19] Ella se quedó no más escuchando la
[1:09:20] conversación
[1:09:22] y el ángel le dijo,
[1:09:24] "¿Dónde está Sara, tu mujer?"
[1:09:31] y le dijo, "Según el tiempo de la vida,
[1:09:33] te voy a visitar
[1:09:37] y ya tendrás tu hijo."
[1:09:40] Pero Sara ya estaba detrás
[1:09:44] diciendo,
[1:09:46] "M, a estas fechas
[1:09:49] ya ha pasado el tiempo. Tengo tiempo de
[1:09:52] no estar con mi marido. Estoy muy
[1:09:54] arrugada, vieja, acabada. No puede ser
[1:09:57] posible.
[1:10:00] Escuche esto. Escuche esto. Escúchelo
[1:10:04] bien.
[1:10:07] Dice el profeta de Dios
[1:10:09] que el milagro, la fe de Abraham,
[1:10:12] escuche esto, escúchelo, escúchelo,
[1:10:14] porque nosotros a veces decimos, "Es que
[1:10:16] a veces no creemos ni en nosotros
[1:10:18] mismos, hermano. Menos vamos a creer en
[1:10:20] alguien más."
[1:10:23] Dice, "La fe de Abraham produjo el
[1:10:26] milagro
[1:10:29] en el vientre de ella, aún cuando ella
[1:10:32] no lo creía."
[1:10:36] Escuche eso,
[1:10:41] piénselo.
[1:10:43] La fe de Abraham produjo el milagro en
[1:10:45] ella
[1:10:48] aún cuando ella no lo creía. ¿Será
[1:10:51] posible que la fe de Job salvó a los
[1:10:53] hijos?
[1:10:54] ¿Es posible que la fe de Job salvó a sus
[1:10:57] hijos? No le des sus hijos al
[1:11:03] Le digo, la fe es poderosa, es más
[1:11:07] poderosa de lo que
[1:11:10] es sumamente poderosa.
[1:11:17] Oh, bendito sea el Señor.
[1:11:20] Él es mi Dios.
[1:11:22] A mí nadie me puede venir a decir que no
[1:11:24] es real.
[1:11:25] Es real. Es real.
[1:11:28] Él es real. Él es un Dios vivo.
[1:11:32] Es un Dios poderoso.
[1:11:40] Oh, Señor.
[1:11:41] Oh,
[1:11:45] con razón Bartimeo el ciego, no quería
[1:11:47] desaprovechar la oportunidad.
[1:11:51] Él dijo, "Esta es mi gran oportunidad.
[1:11:54] Yo no voy a dejar pasar esta oportunidad
[1:11:56] porque yo anoche he soñado toda la noche
[1:12:00] que yo puedo ver.
[1:12:06] Y aún cuando su voz se ahogó entre la
[1:12:09] multitud,
[1:12:11] él se arrodilló. Jesús, hijo de David,
[1:12:14] ten misericordia de mí.
[1:12:22] Oh, bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[1:12:30] Bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[1:12:33] Un
[1:12:33] Dios vivo.
[1:12:35] Qué hermoso.
[1:12:38] Qué hermoso es el Señor.
[1:12:41] Qué precioso.
[1:12:43] Me encanta enamorarlo. Me encanta
[1:12:45] decirle que lo amo. Me encanta decirle
[1:12:48] que es lo más grande.
[1:12:50] Es mi padre, es mi amigo, es mi
[1:12:53] consejero, es mi guía, es mi todo.
[1:13:00] Ay, Señor,
[1:13:03] bendito sea su nombre.
[1:13:08] La fe es tan poderosa
[1:13:11] que el Señor me guió a revisar otra vez
[1:13:15] cuando él le habló a la higuera.
[1:13:19] El primer ser viviente, Mateo,
[1:13:24] él lo narra un poquito diferente.
[1:13:28] Dice allí dice, él le dijo, "Si dijeres
[1:13:30] a esta higuera
[1:13:32] y a este monte"
[1:13:35] dice,
[1:13:37] "Pero este otro ser viviente,
[1:13:42] dices Pedro le dijo,
[1:13:45] "Señor, la higuera que tú maldiste se ha
[1:13:49] secado. Habían pasado una unas horas
[1:13:52] nada más.
[1:13:56] Usualmente la muerte de un árbol
[1:13:58] se nota primeramente en las hojas,
[1:14:01] luego en las ramas, luego en el tallo y
[1:14:05] después en las raíces.
[1:14:08] Pero esa se murió de de las raíces
[1:14:14] y él le dijo,
[1:14:16] "Tened fe en Dios." Mira lo que le dijo.
[1:14:21] Tened fe en Dios.
[1:14:24] Porque cualquiera que dijera este monte
[1:14:28] era un monte real. Dice el hermano Brad,
[1:14:31] él señaló al monte de los Olivos.
[1:14:35] Era algo real, algo, un monte que estaba
[1:14:38] enfente de él.
[1:14:40] Cualquiera que dijera a este monte,
[1:14:43] quítate y échate en el mar y no dudare
[1:14:46] lo que dice, lo que diga, le será hecho.
[1:14:49] Y no dudar en su corazón.
[1:14:51] ¿Ve
[1:14:54] usted que no estamos todavía en un nivel
[1:14:55] de fe alto todavía?
[1:14:59] Ahí vamos. Ahí nos lleva.
[1:15:03] Que se agarre el porque
[1:15:05] inmediatamente lo vamos a parar.
[1:15:09] Inmediatamente lo vamos a parar.
[1:15:14] [aplausos]
[1:15:18] Oh, hermano, eso es poderoso.
[1:15:22] Oh, bendito sea el Señor.
[1:15:24] Que que el Señor nos suba en fe. Yo le
[1:15:30] estaba diciendo al Señor en oración,
[1:15:32] Señor, sube a tu pueblo en fe, que mire
[1:15:36] lo poderoso que tú eres, lo grande, que
[1:15:39] se desate eso que has puesto dentro de
[1:15:41] ellos.
[1:15:46] Ya no más nos trabajamos unos días y ya
[1:15:52] muy poquita fe. No más duele la cabeza y
[1:15:56] anda ahí caído. Muy poquita fe.
[1:16:00] Sí hay, pero muy poquito.
[1:16:06] No más no tenemos dinero. El carro se
[1:16:08] arruinó.
[1:16:11] Muy poquita fe.
[1:16:15] Que Dios nos suba, hermanos,
[1:16:17] que Dios nos ascienda.
[1:16:21] Yo le estaba diciendo al Señor, "Señor,
[1:16:24] si has puesto algo más en mí para ti,
[1:16:28] muéstramelo y sácalo.
[1:16:31] Sácalo y úsalo para el beneficio de tus
[1:16:33] hijos.
[1:16:36] No me quiero ir de aquí. sin manifestar
[1:16:39] lo que él ha puesto dentro de mí.
[1:16:43] Hay muchos potencial en el infierno que
[1:16:45] nunca se desarrolló para el Señor.
[1:16:52] Yo no quiero ser eso.
[1:16:56] Si él me dio hablar en lengua, yo quiero
[1:16:58] hablar en lengua.
[1:17:01] Si él me dio profecía, yo quiero
[1:17:03] profetizar.
[1:17:05] Si él me dio para ser un maestro, yo
[1:17:08] quiero ser un maestro.
[1:17:10] Si él me dio para ser un evangelista, yo
[1:17:13] quiero ser un evangelista. [risas]
[1:17:16] Que él despierte lo que active lo que ya
[1:17:19] ha puesto dentro de nosotros.
[1:17:25] Pónganse de pie, por favor. No deje que
[1:17:28] el engañe.
[1:17:31] Usted fue hecho para ser un Dios.
[1:17:37] No deje que el le mienta,
[1:17:40] que no eres nada, que estás pobre, que
[1:17:43] estás enfermo. No dejes que el
[1:17:45] regrese de todo eso.
[1:17:49] [aplausos]
[1:17:51] Oh, nuestro Dios es un Dios vivo hoy,
[1:17:53] aquí ahora.
[1:17:56] Yo le decía, "Señor, permítenos en la
[1:17:58] iglesia predicar de un Dios vivo.
[1:18:06] Ya tenemos la palabra, resta creer la
[1:18:09] palabra, resta ir más allá de la
[1:18:12] palabra. Ya tenemos la palabra, es el
[1:18:14] fundamento, es nuestro todo, pero
[1:18:17] tenemos que ir más allá.
[1:18:21] Oh, Señor.
[1:18:23] Bendito sea el nombre del Señor.
[1:18:28] Aleluya.
[1:18:29] Aleluya.

[1:19:00] nosotros, no solamente en el edificio,
[1:19:03] sino aquí dentro de nosotros.

[1:19:22] a su pueblo, Señor, en grande manera. Mi
[1:19:25] deseo que nos suba a otro nivel en fe.
[1:19:29] Su profeta, su profeta, Señor, probó
[1:19:33] que esta palabra es verdad.
[1:19:35] Cada mensaje él habla lo sobrenatural.
[1:19:40] Oh, Señor, gracias.
[1:19:43] Bendito sea su nombre en esta noche.
[1:19:46] Muchas gracias, Señor.

[2:01:07] Aleluya.
[2:01:10] Dale gracias por un momento. Solo dele
[2:01:12] gracias ahí donde usted está.
[2:01:16] Gracias, Señor.
[2:01:18] Gracias, Padre,
[2:01:20] por todo lo que has hecho por [música]
[2:01:21] nosotros.
[2:01:23] Gracias por darnos estos servicios,
[2:01:25] Señor.
[2:01:27] Gracias por darnos estas bendiciones.
[2:01:31] Gracias por darnos este ayuno, Señor.
[2:01:34] Ha sido bueno con nosotros.
[2:01:37] Oh, aleluya.
[2:01:38] Aleluya.
[2:01:39] Gracias, Señor.
[2:01:45] Pienso que todos podemos decir,
[2:01:48] nuestra fe no está donde estaba hace 21
[2:01:52] días, ¿verdad?
[2:01:54] Nuestra fe no está donde estaba.
[2:01:58] Hace 7 días.
[2:02:01] Dios nos ha levantado nuestra fe.
[2:02:05] Dios nos ha ayudado a creer por más.
[2:02:08] Ayudado y ha enseñado a creer por más.
[2:02:20] Podemos darle un aplauso a todos los que
[2:02:22] han estado aquí días. [aplausos]
[2:02:31] [aplausos]
[2:02:33] [música]
[2:02:39] Dios bendiga a todos
[2:02:41] esfuerzo,
[2:02:44] los todos los que han estado [música]
[2:02:45] sirviendo también
[2:02:48] en estos días.
[2:02:50] Muchos de nosotros ya no tenemos mucha
[2:02:52] voz.
[2:02:54] Nuestro cuerpo se siente cansado,
[2:02:56] pero nuestra alma se siente bien llena,
[2:03:00] bien llena.
[2:03:03] Oh, iglesia, vamos a escuchar muchos
[2:03:06] testimonios, milagros,
[2:03:10] sanidades [música]
[2:03:12] de lo que Dios ha hecho en estos días.
[2:03:17] Mañana
[2:03:19] va a ser un poquito diferente.
[2:03:22] Mañana
[2:03:24] no vamos a predicar casi. [música]
[2:03:29] Solo tengo un pequeño pensamiento
[2:03:32] que quiero compartir con ustedes, pero
[2:03:35] va a ser algo rápido
[2:03:38] y luego vamos a entrar a la comunión
[2:03:42] y el lavamiento de pies.
[2:03:47] Y vamos a dar una oportunidad más
[2:03:51] después de la comunión [música]
[2:03:54] y lavamiento de pies.
[2:03:57] Vamos a hacer una voy a pedir a todos
[2:03:59] los ministros y a los ancianos que se
[2:04:01] [música] preparen
[2:04:04] y vamos a hacer una línea de oración
[2:04:08] [música] después de que nos hayamos
[2:04:11] puesto bajo esa sangre.
[2:04:15] y arreglado bien con nuestros hermanos,
[2:04:18] que no haya nada dentro de nosotros,
[2:04:21] no haya nada que nos estorbe.
[2:04:24] Vamos a hacer una línea de oración
[2:04:26] después de eso
[2:04:28] y eso va a ser con la culminación
[2:04:30] [música]
[2:04:31] de estos días.
[2:04:34] Así que lo vamos a hacer un poco
[2:04:35] diferente,
[2:04:37] pero eso es [música] lo que Dios ha
[2:04:38] puesto en mi corazón.
[2:04:40] Si hay algo que lo pueda estorbar,
[2:04:44] ¿por qué no lo arregla?
[2:04:46] Porque si si eso
[2:04:50] puede estar deteniendo
[2:04:55] la bendición de Dios sobre usted, sobre
[2:04:57] sus hijos, sobre su familia,
[2:05:01] ¿por qué no arreglarlo?
[2:05:04] ¿Por qué no asegurarnos? [música]
[2:05:10] de que hemos hecho todo lo que podemos
[2:05:13] hacer.
[2:05:16] Si hemos hecho todo lo que podemos
[2:05:18] hacer,
[2:05:20] entonces hay confianza en Dios,
[2:05:24] porque no hay nuestra nuestra
[2:05:25] conciencia, dice la Biblia,
[2:05:28] no nos redarguye de nada.
[2:05:31] Entonces podemos venir y pedir cualquier
[2:05:32] cosa.
[2:05:35] Entonces esa última línea de oración
[2:05:38] [música]
[2:05:39] en especial va a ser para sanidad.
[2:05:42] ¿Sabía usted que la Biblia dice
[2:05:45] que
[2:05:47] muchos están enfermos
[2:05:51] y debilitados
[2:05:53] porque no sabemos aprovechar la
[2:05:56] comunión?
[2:05:59] La Santa Cena,
[2:06:01] la Santa Cena y comunión, lavamiento de
[2:06:04] pies.
[2:06:06] Hay sanidad allí, hay liberación allí.
[2:06:10] Qué mejor tiempo que ahorita.
[2:06:13] Cuando hemos limpiado nuestras mentes,
[2:06:15] hemos limpiado nuestras vidas, hemos
[2:06:18] estado pasando tiempo con Dios. [música]
[2:06:21] Es un buen tiempo
[2:06:23] para pedirle a Dios que nos ayude, que
[2:06:27] nos libere.
[2:06:28] [música]
[2:06:28] que nos sane. Así que eso es lo que
[2:06:31] vamos a hacer mañana.
[2:06:34] Y [música] este
[2:06:37] gracias a todos ustedes, hermanos,
[2:06:40] que estuvieron haciendo todo el esfuerzo
[2:06:43] [música]
[2:06:44] después de su trabajo,
[2:06:46] cansados,
[2:06:48] pero había algo dentro de usted
[2:06:52] que sabía que estos no eran cualquier
[2:06:54] servicios.
[2:06:56] sino que Dios los colocó para nuestra
[2:06:59] ayuda.
[2:07:01] Así que [música] Dios los bendiga.
[2:07:04] Igual las puertas van a abrir a las 6:30
[2:07:06] para el que guste venir a orar, los que
[2:07:08] están cerca [música] y puedan.
[2:07:14] Servicio comienza a las 7:15. [música]
[2:07:23] Para aquellos que están planeando hacer
[2:07:25] la comunión, [música]
[2:07:30] les recuerdo
[2:07:32] que se examinen
[2:07:35] lo que nos enseña la Biblia.
[2:07:38] Si hay algo dentro de nosotros,
[2:07:40] arreglarlo.
[2:07:43] Si no nos hemos bautizado,
[2:07:46] hay que tratar de hacer eso primero
[2:07:50] y luego venir
[2:07:53] limpios
[2:07:55] y también venir al lavamiento de pies
[2:07:59] con nada en nuestro corazón,
[2:08:02] contra nuestros hermanos,
[2:08:05] contra cualquiera,
[2:08:09] porque eso estorba el Espíritu Santo.
[2:08:12] Traigan una toalla si planean hacer
[2:08:14] lavamiento de pies.
[2:08:22] También les anunciamos que el 22, el
[2:08:24] jueves,
[2:08:27] va a haber un compañerismo
[2:08:31] a las 5:30.
[2:08:34] Ah, si planea [música] asistir, por
[2:08:36] favor, registrarse.
[2:08:39] [música]
[2:08:40] Y el viernes no vamos a hacer servicio
[2:08:43] aquí
[2:08:45] [música]
[2:08:45] hasta el domingo.
[2:08:50] Amén. Vamos a ponernos de pie.
[2:09:01] Tenemos a un Dios tan real. [música]
[2:09:05] Mi corazón
[2:09:07] está tan contento por su presencia.
[2:09:09] [música]
[2:09:18] Nuestra hermana Elena [música] dice,
[2:09:20] "Pido oraciones, ya que estaré saliendo
[2:09:22] para Uruap en este próximo sábado. Que
[2:09:25] sea Dios en todo.
[2:09:32] Vamos a inclinar nuestro rostro.
[2:09:35] [música]
[2:09:35] Vamos a ponernos delante del Señor,
[2:09:39] dale gracias
[2:09:41] por sus bendiciones,
[2:09:44] por permitirnos completar [música] estos
[2:09:46] s días de servicio,
[2:09:51] por todas sus bendiciones.
[2:09:54] Sepa que el va a querer venir en
[2:09:56] contra de usted
[2:09:59] y ha estado viniendo
[2:10:02] a una hora. Yo estaba batallando con
[2:10:04] ciertos espíritus,
[2:10:07] pero él es más,
[2:10:10] él es más grande, él es mayor,
[2:10:14] el que está en nosotros es mayor,
[2:10:17] pero el tiene que hacer su
[2:10:18] trabajo,
[2:10:20] pero no se deje.
[2:10:22] Rechácelo,
[2:10:23] rechácelo. Usted tiene el poder para
[2:10:27] rechazarlo,
[2:10:28] para, como decía nuestro hermano
[2:10:30] Eduardo, para regresarle todos sus
[2:10:32] demonios.
[2:10:36] No se deje.
[2:10:38] Dios ha sido real en nuestras vidas.
[2:10:42] Vamos a ponernos en las manos del Dios.
[2:10:45] [música]
[2:10:50] Amantísimo Padre Celestial,
[2:10:53] Señor,
[2:10:55] gracias, Padre,
[2:10:57] gracias por todo, Señor.
[2:11:00] Gracias por estar aquí cada día, Señor.
[2:11:04] Padre,
[2:11:07] tú respaldas el esfuerzo de cada uno de
[2:11:10] mis hermanos, Señor.
[2:11:15] y los honras a cada uno de sus esfuerzos
[2:11:17] de ellos.
[2:11:20] Gracias, Padre.
[2:11:23] Señor Lord,
[2:11:26] ponemos esas manos levantadas, Señor,
[2:11:31] bajo tus pies, Señor.

[2:11:35] también,
[2:11:38] Señor,
[2:11:41] que tú seas cumpliendo sus necesidades,
[2:11:43] Señor.
[2:11:45] Que no pase, Señor, a nadie,
[2:11:48] Padre.
[2:11:50] Cualquier cosa que mis hermanos
[2:11:51] necesiten, Señor,
[2:11:54] que tú seas con ellos.
[2:11:58] Gracias, Padre,
[2:12:01] porque este día, Señor,
[2:12:04] ha sido un día más de victoria, Padre.
[2:12:07] Señor,
[2:12:09] contigo todo se puede, Padre.
[2:12:13] No hay nada imposible para ti,
[2:12:16] Señor.
[2:12:18] Aumenta nuestra fe, Señor.
[2:12:21] Padre,
[2:12:24] que esa fe, Señor,
[2:12:27] sea tan fortalecida, Padre,
[2:12:30] para que ningún viento venga, Señor,
[2:12:33] y nos pueda derribar, Padre.
[2:12:37] [música]
[2:12:38] Que esa fe, Señor,
[2:12:40] está fundamentada en tu palabra, Padre,
[2:12:44] que eches raíces en nuestros corazones,
[2:12:46] Señor.
[2:12:48] Gracias, Señor.
[2:12:50] Guárdanos, Padre.
[2:12:53] Nos vamos de aquí, Señor,
[2:12:56] pero que tú estés en nuestros corazones,
[2:12:58] Padre.
[2:13:00] Gracias, Señor. Nos ponemos en tus manos
[2:13:05] en el precioso nombre
[2:13:07] de nuestro Señor Jesucristo.
[2:13:13] Sean tan amable [música] de tomar su
[2:13:14] asiento.
[2:13:18] Somos despedidos [música] y vamos a a
[2:13:21] guardar reverencia
[2:13:24] al Espíritu Santo.
[2:13:26] hermanos que se van a quedar orando y
[2:13:29] cuando salga que hay que guardar
[2:13:30] silencio.
[2:13:32] Guarda silencio.
[2:13:38] No sé por qué,
[2:13:42] oh Señor, tú me [música] tocaste.
[2:13:46] No sé por qué
[2:13:50] en mí [música] tú te fijaste,
[2:13:54] pero
[2:13:56] sí [música] sé. Oh, qué grande es tu
[2:14:01] amor
[2:14:02] por mí. [música]
[2:14:06] Mi corazón
[2:14:11] está agradecido. [música]
[2:14:14] Mi corazón
[2:14:18] [música]
[2:14:19] está aquí rendido
[2:14:22] y contigo
[2:14:25] siempre.
[2:14:27] Oh, [música] quiero,
[2:14:28] Señor,

[2:14:36] y porque [música]
[2:14:39] fuera
[2:14:42] de ti

[2:15:54] todo [música] el día y en ti yo siempre
[2:16:01] quiero,
