[19:32] we're thankful for one more day of life
[19:35] put ourselves in your hands
[19:39] Lord may your word be spoken
[19:42] the way your Prophet has brought it
[19:47] in the name Lord Jesus Christ
[19:50] amen amen
[19:55] I'd quickly like to go into the
[19:58] scripture
[20:02] they're in first Thessalonians 4 15.
[20:07] we will continue speaking
[20:12] what our pastor has been preaching
[20:19] this is
[20:20] the falling way
[20:23] senor
[20:26] okay
[20:33] for this we say unto you by the word of
[20:36] the Lord that we which are alive and
[20:38] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[20:40] now prevent them which are asleep
[20:42] foreign
[20:55] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[20:58] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[21:00] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[21:02] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[21:16] then we which are alive and remain shall
[21:19] be caught up together with them in the
[21:21] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[21:23] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[21:28] you can follow me please Sir John 10
[21:31] verse 1.
[21:37] I like to call this uh preaching
[21:45] he will call and I will answer
[21:48] this is uno
[21:52] John 10 verse 1 says
[21:55] foreign
[22:20] of the Sheep
[22:31] and the sheep hear his voice and he
[22:34] calleth his own Sheep by name and leaded
[22:36] them out
[22:44] and when he puteth forth his own sheep
[22:47] he goes before them and the Sheep follow
[22:49] him for they know his voice
[22:57] and a stranger will they not follow but
[23:01] will flee from him for they know not the
[23:03] voice of strangers estates
[23:10] this purple spake Jesus unto them but
[23:12] they understood not what things they
[23:14] were which he spoken to them
[23:22] then said Jesus unto them again verily
[23:25] verily I say unto you I am the door of
[23:28] the sheep
[23:29] you may be Cedar brother
[23:34] I'm gonna go very slowly
[23:37] yes
[23:41] Sunday school Sunday morning
[23:45] there's no need to shout
[23:48] to run
[23:52] but I bring a thought with me
[23:59] pastor says a man without a pastor
[24:05] will not be in the resurrection
[24:13] and the reference of the references I
[24:16] have with what I be speaking is
[24:24] in the message the Good Shepherd of the
[24:27] sheep my brother Branham preached 1957.
[24:32] the Sumerian Church age preach 1960
[24:37] Jesus Take insights with Jesus 1962.
[24:45] in 1964 why it had to be Shepherds
[24:51] and the message why it had to be
[24:54] Shepherds
[24:56] brother Branham begins to describe
[25:00] what a Shepherd is
[25:04] Pastor in English but the word Shepherd
[25:07] in English
[25:10] is
[25:12] a compound word
[25:16] the first is sheep
[25:19] that means a sheep
[25:23] and her that means heard
[25:26] Shepherds
[25:35] is
[25:42] they have Fellowship so much with their
[25:45] sheep
[25:47] that they get to smell like sheep
[25:53] and sometimes they even laugh like sheep
[25:57] Italian
[26:26] so be sacrificed
[26:39] there he says
[26:44] Isaiah 53 verse 6 he said
[26:49] all we like sheep have gone astray todos
[26:53] all
[26:57] so we all count ourselves in there
[27:04] everyone turned away
[27:06] from his own way
[27:10] everyone got their own ideas
[27:16] everyone walked according to what they
[27:19] thought was the best for them but even
[27:21] there this is
[27:26] and the Lord hath laid on him the
[27:29] iniquity of us all
[28:20] and he starts to say why did he appear
[28:23] to Shepherds
[28:26] why did he not appear to the theologians
[28:31] peoples Scholars from back then
[28:35] esperando those that were expecting him
[28:37] yes and he says
[28:42] because they had added
[28:45] their way of thinking
[28:48] to how they believed that he would come
[28:54] see
[29:01] any man could have thought of it
[29:03] and he came in the form
[29:06] of a lamb
[29:16] the first he would have done foreign
[29:51] and he says
[29:55] watch the prophets
[29:59] how they dress from sheepskins
[30:03] watch Moses
[30:06] a prophet and Shepherd or pasture
[30:27] because that was his calling
[30:30] this
[30:31] Brandon says
[30:36] why Shepherds dress with sheepskins
[30:46] foreign
[31:05] will come to remove the sin of the world
[31:08] pero
[31:10] cuando Senor Jesus Christ for when the
[31:12] Lord Jesus Christ came
[31:16] he came in a very humble way
[31:20] to the theologians of that time
[31:23] they over saw that
[31:59] people that were fishermen humble people
[32:01] amen amen
[32:04] Oda now
[32:09] we should understand one thing okay
[32:18] Jesus Christ has an army
[32:22] army our ranks there are positions
[32:28] but all of these positions
[32:32] inside a church
[32:35] should respond or answer to a pastor
[32:39] porque
[32:40] is
[33:01] in the message
[33:03] the Good Shepherd of the Sheep
[33:05] this is
[33:19] if the barrier puts you underground and
[33:22] dig six feet under you
[33:26] foreign
[34:03] a stranger though not follow and though
[34:06] says
[34:07] so there's a condescendence
[34:11] in this co-descendants
[34:16] we have the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:18] primeramente first of all and Don says
[34:24] and then the messenger is next yesterday
[34:30] pastor and this
[34:33] messenger is a prophet Pastor yes
[34:39] gives his message
[34:43] again to whom to theologians
[34:47] alos pastores to the pastors or
[34:50] Shepherds yes those pastores and these
[34:52] Shepherds and dragon
[34:54] give their message
[34:57] to the Sheep
[35:00] that's that's how it goes look
[35:07] a pastor
[35:26] and
[35:29] follow me
[36:04] so bring you back in
[36:09] the difference between us and this
[36:13] because when we see the drug addict we
[36:17] criticize him
[36:19] we see the prostitute
[36:22] criticize her
[36:25] when someone goes astray
[36:28] we talk about it we criticize
[36:40] like one of his flock
[36:45] so when Jesus Christ is saying
[36:49] my sheep hear my voice
[36:53] hear my word yes this is
[37:01] what the shepherd Pastor speaks
[37:05] and recognize That's The Voice
[37:08] of Jesus Christ foreign directly
[37:45] foreign
[38:59] [Music]
[39:06] I see this and see you as simple as that
[39:22] we have to discuss something I said
[39:27] [Music]
[39:29] look in the message taking sides with
[39:32] Jesus
[39:33] paragraph 23
[39:36] this is
[39:38] and he's trying to explain
[39:41] the order of the church it is
[39:49] now we're going to start off with the
[39:51] early church Iber
[39:55] strange
[40:02] down to what they did and then I can
[40:04] show you the vision that I have for the
[40:06] future
[40:09] the prophet is
[40:12] a vision he had for them
[40:18] he knew it was coming even after his
[40:20] death okay
[40:27] each one of these churches
[40:31] he left someone who was in order
[40:35] remember there's an order
[40:39] a man that was trustworthy
[40:43] a man that was known Pastor as a pastor
[40:48] Shepherd
[40:53] then after this church
[41:01] or then after this church then become
[41:04] other little churches come out of it
[41:09] young men and old men raised up and
[41:12] become churches out of them
[41:16] the man that was over the first church
[41:18] was called
[41:20] and then his
[41:22] that went out from him his children
[41:27] was called Shepherds or pastors
[41:32] a pastor and this is the jagara Serpa
[41:35] store before becoming a pastor El Diago
[41:40] first he is a sheep he said yes Isaiah
[41:43] 53. pastor
[41:54] Lolo
[41:59] Prophet Pastor is
[42:06] the pastor
[42:08] maestros or the report teachers the
[42:12] Evangelist
[42:14] everyone is
[42:16] in a congregation
[42:18] all the Ministries al pastor to the
[42:22] passage and after the pastor
[42:25] he said
[42:28] and there is
[42:36] if God has ever called you to be a
[42:39] pastor
[42:42] mere
[42:49] attending a church
[42:51] no no no
[42:54] oh
[42:57] because brother Titus is my pastor
[43:00] because I say that that has nothing to
[43:03] do let's see what the prophet says
[43:08] why did he choose pastors
[43:14] paragraph 224
[43:17] you say is
[43:23] now we know every time that the
[43:25] crucified crisis accepted
[43:28] there's a new birth
[43:33] says there's a newborn sheep
[43:38] or Los Angeles there are songs in heaven
[43:41] for the Angels
[43:46] the Angels sing again
[43:49] they say
[43:52] um
[43:57] you say well I lived a good life
[44:01] so they're the apostles
[44:06] but it wasn't born again until they
[44:09] received the Holy Spirit
[44:14] it wasn't even converted until they
[44:17] received the Holy Spirit
[44:20] you remember the night before the
[44:22] Betrayal or on the Betrayal
[44:26] um
[44:41] Peter had followed him for three and a
[44:44] half years
[44:50] born again
[45:02] a pasture
[45:07] watch what I'm gonna tell you brethren
[45:24] become a sheep
[45:27] is the Lord's flock
[45:32] because there is no seed in here
[45:35] but if the holy spirit
[45:38] that was once in Jesus Christ
[45:41] your pastor and Don says
[45:46] I can receive the Holy Spirit
[45:48] [Music]
[45:53] amen amen
[45:56] amen
[45:58] God bless you
[46:01] [Applause]
[46:06] amen
[46:09] amen
[46:17] esta manana
[46:24] with a tremendous message we've heard
[46:27] respondere
[46:30] call and ask your answer
[46:32] is
[46:36] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 21
[46:39] says like this is
[46:48] for instance by a Man Came Death
[46:53] Resurrection de los Muertos my man came
[46:56] also the resurrection of the Dead
[47:01] through a man a death entered
[47:07] but also the resurrection of the dead
[47:10] has to come through a man
[47:16] verse 22.
[47:22] even so in Christ shall all be made
[47:24] alive
[47:25] one more scripture hope capitulo
[47:30] Job chapter 14.
[47:33] verse
[47:38] 14.
[47:41] Job 14 verse 14 says like this
[47:46] is
[47:49] if a man shall if a man dies shall he
[47:53] live again
[47:59] all the days of my appointed time will I
[48:02] wait till my change come
[48:05] palabra
[48:07] what a tremendous word we have read
[48:11] uh job was a man okay
[48:16] just as you and I
[48:19] am
[48:21] things had happened in his life
[48:24] he was a man
[48:28] that had experienced pain
[48:33] he had experienced Brokenness
[48:47] that's right
[48:52] there were many questions in the in jobs
[48:57] because job would see nature
[49:02] he would see the cycle of that nature
[49:05] oh you can see the trees
[49:09] when in the springtime they would
[49:11] Blossom or Bloom
[49:13] they would look so beautiful
[49:18] he saw how they flourished in that
[49:21] Springtime
[49:23] and in the summer they continue to be
[49:26] beautiful
[49:28] but then the fall would come in
[49:32] he would see how those leaves
[49:35] would begin to change colors
[49:38] begin to fall off the trees
[49:41] and then the winter Cameo
[49:46] it would dry up
[50:07] the winter would come in
[50:11] and how that tree appeared to be dead
[50:17] within the springtime would come around
[50:19] again
[50:20] and it appeared like that
[50:23] although it appeared
[50:26] it appeared like there was no life
[50:30] the life would come up again
[50:35] when he saw all those things
[50:38] only saw his condition
[50:43] he asked himself
[50:45] por que Lombre why man dies
[50:51] if a man dies shall he live again
[50:56] compare with nature jobs
[51:17] sitting there
[51:19] sitting there sick there's noodles
[51:28] his children had passed away
[51:34] his properties had been had been
[51:36] destroyed
[51:41] what reminded him
[51:44] curse your God and die
[51:47] how tremendous
[51:51] but God's plan
[51:54] is it's very tremendous
[51:59] because God likes
[52:02] a momentos take us through moments
[52:06] where we know
[52:09] that we can't depend on it
[52:15] and of the men that God has placed
[52:20] I'm going to read a quote
[52:25] this element brother Brown says
[52:30] when they say
[52:33] Hobe and Sumas Grande a job in his
[52:36] greatest English
[52:40] this morning uh job was our character
[52:46] Elke
[52:52] that when he was in the deepest of his
[52:54] distress
[52:58] when all of his riches have gone from
[53:00] him
[53:02] his children was dead
[53:06] his body was broken
[53:14] and he was in the greatest distress that
[53:16] he was ever in is
[53:23] how tremendous
[53:26] tremendous
[53:44] I think about death
[53:50] resurrection and I began to think on
[53:52] about how we speak on the resurrection
[53:55] I think about my life
[53:58] I I I Tres Casas
[54:03] you know there are three things that
[54:05] happened to us before we depart from
[54:07] this Earth
[54:15] you know there are three voices
[55:14] has to be quickened already
[55:17] all right
[55:19] when I think and Hope on job
[55:25] and seeing his condition
[55:29] and seeing how God works
[55:32] Como Dios
[55:34] how God worked in Abraham
[55:38] is
[55:41] God could have chose a young man and a
[55:44] young lady
[55:45] to say to themes out of you will come
[55:50] generation
[55:52] the great generation or a great uh
[55:55] descendancy
[55:57] but God chooses
[56:01] of things that seem to be impossible
[56:06] to demonstrated
[56:37] his own word
[56:57] his wife she was an elderly woman
[57:02] the time of our life had passed for her
[57:05] she was barren
[57:07] or she was dead
[57:14] and God wants to reflect his powers
[57:19] who wants to show that he is
[57:30] this morning
[57:52] I'm in
[57:58] attention hope Joe catches my attention
[58:03] brother Brandon says
[58:08] it was at that at the greatest hour
[58:12] foreign
[59:10] man
[59:12] acovertiso
[59:14] Como El cuarbon and Jolo recipe and to
[59:18] the Coal Shed where I received it
[59:22] God has a place
[59:25] and a purpose
[59:31] I want to tell you a place of time and a
[59:35] purpose
[59:37] there are occasions
[59:43] where we feel so separated
[59:48] death is also a separation from God
[59:52] but God has the time
[59:54] is
[1:00:00] when he had a job in this condition
[1:00:06] he had him on the sacred Sands
[1:00:09] algo
[1:00:16] where he was going to reveal something
[1:00:18] to him that would never go away
[1:00:22] don't you think God Brothers
[1:00:29] of conditions
[1:00:32] feel like we're worthy
[1:00:37] we feel like maybe this isn't foreign
[1:01:01] because we're not where we should be
[1:01:03] pero
[1:01:06] is
[1:01:07] but these words give me a give me uh
[1:01:10] they encouragement
[1:01:11] because it doesn't matter how low we are
[1:01:14] no important
[1:01:21] many times
[1:01:33] they will never forget
[1:01:35] a
[1:01:44] H Jesus
[1:01:45] out there hello
[1:01:47] he gets you on those places
[1:01:50] where there is no devil
[1:01:53] Hamas
[1:01:56] no devil can ever come
[1:01:59] the devil can't get there
[1:02:01] I'll tell you this morning
[1:02:10] hearing his words
[1:02:15] the devil has no luck or he has no luck
[1:02:18] there he said
[1:02:21] he says
[1:02:26] the resurrection is a revelation
[1:02:29] Brothers
[1:02:33] they say El
[1:02:37] levels
[1:02:39] he gives you something on those stands
[1:02:42] back there a model the experiencia
[1:02:51] set of experience that you'll never
[1:02:53] forget as long as ages roll on
[1:02:57] La Resurrection the resurrection
[1:03:00] is
[1:03:05] and Revelation comes through his word
[1:03:08] there's no other way Brothers
[1:03:16] it's not jumping
[1:03:20] personal revelation you have with God
[1:03:24] and as it's been said this morning
[1:03:27] Resurrection no Resurrection
[1:03:32] when I see the pastor many times
[1:03:38] of the fault
[1:03:44] the pastor since we were children
[1:03:51] and that's how we were
[1:03:55] how difficult it is
[1:03:57] you see Beyond the Veil remember
[1:04:41] is through a man
[1:04:46] things that you may perhaps not
[1:04:48] understand when
[1:04:49] I see the pastor
[1:04:54] I think I'm the one that gives them all
[1:04:56] those gray hairs
[1:04:58] official
[1:05:00] because how difficult it is
[1:05:05] to set aside those curtains but it's the
[1:05:09] way of God
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:39] look Brothers
[1:05:41] a
[1:05:45] music I recall when I was at home with
[1:05:49] my wife
[1:05:53] and our pastor came to speak with us
[1:06:03] I have a certificate of a pastor as well
[1:06:08] but the truth is these brothers that we
[1:06:10] were dead
[1:06:12] and the word the words
[1:06:15] there's no way that you can bring life
[1:06:18] it has to be through the body
[1:06:21] Brothers
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:37] it's through the pastor here already
[1:06:45] nothing began to bring life
[1:06:47] that's the only way
[1:06:50] it comes down it tells us
[1:06:56] come out of this place
[1:07:00] you better start liking them
[1:07:03] because there's no other way
[1:07:06] things
