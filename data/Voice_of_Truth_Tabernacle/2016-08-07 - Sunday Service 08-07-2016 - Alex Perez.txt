you are privileged not because you deserve to not by your good works or deeds but because God you had something in you and God chose you and God chose you for Praise of his glory we are worshippers we should be the best worshippers in this earth amen be reading in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 great Sunday school this morning hallelujah hallelujah God bless our brother Jesus may the Lord continue giving him moreis Genesis 1 verse one I can't let this pass by me to give thanks to the Lord for our P for the opportunity he gives us to share his pulpit how wonderful when you know your pastor know there's things he can tell me we're connected very deep with our pastor he might say something that could correct us but you don't take it as something you thank him because he's taking care of us what a wonderful relationship the Lord bless him wherever he is with ouren from Kansas let's read from verse one to verse three I hope you had breakfast this morning amen Amen brother okay God's word says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and there period on your Bible all right it's very important to read commas and periods it says that not even an ink of of it will pass it will pass it has to be fulfilled okay verse two says and the Earth was without form and void there's a pause there right stand but you'll take your seats right now I want you to see that God creates the Heaven and Earth and then there's a period and in verse two then says and the Earth was without form and void we continue reading and darkness was upon the face of the deep there was a deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters verse three says and God said let there be light and there was light how many believed God's word how many believe it's the Eternal Word of God you may bow your heads and let us pray father in these moments we come before your presence we believe your word is already blessed Lord your word has words to raise us but now I ask you in this morning that this word be made flesh in us that your word be quickened in us because if not Lord It's just words I don't only want words we want your quickening spirit to Quicken Us in this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Breen thank you if you turn your page and Isaiah chapter 65 hallelujah how many are here this morning Hallelujah you understand me now when I say for here I hope your body spirit and soul are here it's important Isaiah 65:1 17 says for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind if we can have a theme this morning I want you to be meditating in this small thought a new creation okay can you repeat it this morning a new creation please one more creation all right the first creation that God created if you see in Genesis 1:1 the Bible says that God in the beginning created the heavens and the Earth you find the word created in verse one Genesis 1:1 and God created the heavens and the Earth okay all right the prophet speaks to us of verse one and verse two something happened there because when God creates something God does not create something out of order God doesn't create something with void when God creates something he creates it perfect if you meditate in Genesis 1 126 when the Bible says let us make man unto our image and likeness the prophet says that that man was perfect was perfect there were no mistakes in this man there wasn't darkness in this man there weren Shadows on this man this man of genesis: 126 was made to the image of God now we've spoke or I've began to speak of light light bre how we said the past the previous time it's very important the light brother in our lives in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth but in verse two brethren we see that this Earth is in disorder and void Amen brother I have to put a foundation because it's fine to scream and worship God but I want you to catch something I want it's important C how it's flowing so it makes sense in your heart the prophet says a preaching can make a sinner repent teaching places a Christian we want to place the children of God who are you am I and if I can tell you this morning if you are a son of God you have a supernatural life just like the prophet had like the Lord Jesus Supernatural light every son and daughter of God amen amen can I continue okay are we good till now in verse three hear me God says let there be light and there was light says the Bible okay I've taught you we've been taught that when or When God says let there be light the prophet says there the logos came out of God okay the word of God came out if I can say between words I have not started my message but if I can say it in parenthesis God's word always brings light always brings light now hear me what I'm about to say it brings light when the word is for your hear me right you cannot feed yourself or or shine a light on yourself from another light from an old light the light of yesterday it's not good for the light of today you need to live in the light of the day the light of today that light the one who that brings light to your life one who brings light to your heart it brings light to a dark life I used to have a a dark life I was in churches I would preach I believed I felt the Holy Spirit I felt it I would fall in this flesh but my soul was [Music] dark but one day a light shined on my heart that went and spoke to me and said there is a light before the foundation of that had been deposited in you and now you can shine and give life that is why a Son of God when he walks in a dark place that place turns into light because the Son of God light to humanity it brings life to this Eden of Satan are you understanding me Hallelujah we are light okay I have to teach because if not for your worship because in denominations someone jumps and we all start brother Ronnie knows he came out of a great church there you come in a church no here we enter like if we're attending a funeral the the the songs begin and you start turning but there isn't life there because the light is in this day hallelujah hallelujah is is that right brother cor yes knows too I know we all [Music] know but that there's a substance in what we're speaking okay listen to me Hallelujah continue praising the word of the the name of the Lord the first thing that that was created in the creation was the light the last thing that was created was the man I want you to see this the the prophet says the first thing that was created was the light the light of the word of God loose the word of God is light but it has to be in your right fulfilling why because I cannot apply what life in my life that was back then that light shined there that line Shin there I need the light of today as our brother said now okay the first thing that was created was the light after the light we knew we know the first man came Genesis 126 for them who like to note down Christian has to bring bring three things to church Genesis 1:26 God creates the first man and the first man says the Bible created to the image and likeness of God what is God what is God what is God God is Spirit can we agree that God is says God is a Spirit Worship in spirit and truth it's necessary to be worshiped the first man was a spirit we know but here the prophet says that the last creation was the man the man on this Earth the man was formed we know that the man of Genesis 126 was created Spirit but Genesis 2:7 we know that the Bible says that God formed another man a man of the earth good right it's just a message okay the thing here is how to connect this first light with this with the man of Genesis 2:7 because this light and this man have to be United you have to unite to that first light that light created what came out of God has to unite to you you that are dust you that were formed Out of the Dust this light has to unite to you so it can cause something are we good okay all right let's continue onward in Isaiah 65:1 17 see what the Bible says remember that my thought is a new creation for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind the Bible speaks to us of a new creation Peter spoke to us of a new creation Isaiah spoke to us of a new creation John spoke to us of a new Earth and a new new heaven that in Genesis 1 God made everything perfect there the devil got his hands in the devil gets his hands in and when the devil was when his throne was taken away from heaven where was the devil in heaven and Revelation says a battle in heaven we know the Bible right okay his throne was his throne was taken down to the Earth and when he got here to the Earth his process began to also make an Eden of Satan and Eden where he would receive worship remember what the devil wants more is worship why because God he is the only true God and the one who should be worshiped here we worship the almighty God we don't worship anything else my glory my strength and my honor for the only true God I hope we're all agreeing here so the devil begins his Eden as our Pastor said we know there was the fall and then the process of his Eden begins we heard of our pastor that it took the devil 6,000 years to make his creation to make his Eden are you following me now you and I are found here here we are you live in Earth in the Eden of Satan you don't have to believe it I'm not here for for people to believe if you believe God's word you'll believe what we're saying the word has to give testimony that we're speaking the truth this is the Eden of Satan the devil in infiltrated and that first creation of God okay he began to get his Filthy Hands in Hallelujah Eden of Sayan as our Pastor said the question here is what do I have to do how will the bride fight what do you and I have to do as Believers of this message Christians that we supposedly say we are and I believe we are Christians I'd like to read a quote from the prophet see what the prophet says how the devil began to make this world his Eden speaking of this Earth the prophet will explain what's happening only it's just the atmospheres that are around it okay let's analyze this they are only the atmospheres the devil very wisely came and began to work with the atmospheres of this Earth hear me right he began to work with the [Music] atmospheres and the sin that is upon the Earth we know that there is sin there's sin in this world okay all right God wants to create a new creation am amen God wants to do something and he will there is a millennium where you'll be able to live a thousand years but follow me this morning don't get lost so the prophet begins to speak of this new creation and the prophet says there are only the atmospheres around and the sin that is upon the Earth the one who who will be destroyed the ones who will be destroyed now in our mind we think that because God will create a new Heaven and a new Earth sometimes we have the concept concept that God will destroy this one this Earth totally completely completely that there will be a atomic bombs nukes and will dissolve this entire planet Earth we're learning and understanding that God is not going to do that God does not destroy his first creation God does not destroy his first creation that is why if you were created in the first creation you will not be destroyed that will live and Rule upon this Earth let's continue there's a lot to be [Music] said now we notice that in heaven means that the atmospheres are above okay so we're speaking Brethren that God will bring a new creation but he will not destroy this first Earth or first creation but it will be an annihilation all the atmospheres in this Earth because brother let's be real the atmospheres of this Earth anoint us almost every day yes or no the atmospheres in which we live anoints it almost every day come to church tired the Breen is crawling come to church the husband fighting with the wife or the wife there are problems there difficulties headaches I can't bear this body those are the atmospheres you and I live under see yes brother am are there wit is there any Witnesses here yes right but God wants to create a new creation God wants to cleanse this atmosphere and he will do it has to be purified with fire aren't you glad for this that one day the headaches will stop there won't be any bad atmospher brother you won't be struggling with the devil everything will be glory everything will be praise see you can't even say glory to God now but I understand there are the atmospheres that we're barely getting started what are you going to do while there's a new creation while this globe is purified with fire what will you do with these atmosphere see see in the message here a there's a man who can start a light a fire because we believe that the sons of God have a remember and follow the line we're starting of we're speaking of Sons and Daughters of that while the atmospheres are full of Darkness there are sons of God walking remember this a Son of God can walk in the light hallelujah hallelujah the light comes from God the word the light came by the spoken word if you don't speak it if it does not come out of your it has no effect you think maybe God will heal me someday but it can't fit in your lips if you don't confess because the spoken word that has power on your life has power to deliver us when you're feeling tired speak to yourself I am a son of God I rebuke these negative atmospheres I am a Son of God a light here in me believe it brother believe it you'll see what happens later on yes God's word says let there be light when there wasn't light she sent the light to separate the Shadows from the light let's elaborate in this let's elaborate in this because I'm sure you don't understand this let me give you let me share to you a little of what God has given to me I know that this is dust I was formed from the dust of the earth you were formed from the dust of the Earth this body we came from the dust and we will return from the dust the atmospheres ENT body right the atmospheres that are are surrounding us right now they are connecting with this Earth with this dust this here the negative atmospheres come it's true Brethren and they want to continue to the spirit and if they get to the soul well it's done so the Bible and the prophet are saying this when there wasn't any light he sent the light to separate the Shadows from the light I realize that this dust is a shadow is a shadow it's true there ain't nothing good in here there ain't nothing good in this dust but God wants to separate this dust wants to open this so the light of God can enter in the soul because that's where the life is this word says the prophet demands he said he let go of the heaven so he can let the sun shine let's apply to our lives you have to move this dust let the son of the the son of the word of God this word can make contact with his light inside if it does not make contact he will never produce the life of Jesus Christ you can jump you can worship God but you will never produce life I want the life do you want the life you want the true emotions feelings Christ in US glory to God I haven't even gotone to my theme yet and his word today as the brother said today today it's the one that separates brother we want this to be separated because these atmospheres of the Eden of Satan wants want to stick because this dust is from the earth the dust calls the Earth but the spirit is calling something else his word today is the one who separates the atmosph of unbelief says the prophet what does this mean that sometimes you're calling these because of your unbelief yes every time that I'm doubting God's word there's a negative atmosphere because what the devil wants to do it's for you to not believe the word of God and when you disbelieve the word of there's unbelief in you things believe or disbelief that's when you create that but the question continues what can we do what can we do while there's a new Earth and a new Heaven forgive me when this world will be annihilated all the atmospheres what will we do in the meantime I'm starting my message see what the Bible says and second of Corinthians 5 ver ver 17 I hope you enjoy the word like I said we can have a service of Revival of jumping but that won't change your life I'll just make you have a good time here we want a change of our nature therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new now I'm barely entering brother into it listening to a preaching of a a brother preached 4 hours and at the end of four hours he says I'm starting if you see there's also a new creation here there's a new creation in you when you are in Christ the prophet says how are you in Christ churches give you a handshake in church they give you a flyer and they say welcome you're a member of Christ but the prophet tells us to be in Christ you have to be born again enter in the body of Christ and that makes you a new creation you are a new creature when you are born again not only of water I baptized Hallelujah 15 years ago but I barely received the Holy Spirit not too long ago he's speaking of a new nature when this nature is changed to a divine [Music] nature how many who believes in a new nature hallelujah hallelujah if you see in second Corinthians right where we're reading it looks like Isaiah 65 because God works with this Earth just as he deals with the Earth because the Earth God works with the Earth the same way God wants to make a purification upon this Earth are you listening are you following me so you now you if you have been born again the Bible and the message back up that you are a new nature okay a new creature yes creature you are there has been a birth in the soul here you continue the same right but in your soul something has been born there's a new man that born of God that man does not doubt that man does not doubt Amen to God's word because has been born from the word the one on the outside doubts right on the inside that leaves God's mouth all right there's a new nature here if you have been born again now I'll read a quote and you tell me what you think not now maybe later read from the beginning we're speaking of a of a nature right when we've been born from the spirit of God God is not weak in one place and strong in the other if you have a little shadow of God in you maybe the minimum of God sometimes we want God to give me more God the prophet says if you have the minimum the problem is that sometimes we don't even have the minimum can we be honest this morning if you have the minimum of God then you have all of the Power you have enough power in you create a world and go and live in it are you guys following me tonight do you believe what the prophet says if you have the minimum of God you have the power in you to create a world go live in it we continue but of course that power is controlled by faith if it we would all have our own world living in it here the prophet says something tremendous I still don't see anyone with an with a faith someone with enough Faith to say brother I created a world and I'm going to go live in that world if not the prophet says we would all be over there faith is a revelation we maybe don't have that revelation and go live in it okay all right may we still don't have that Revelation still don't have that Revelation world and go live in it realize how much power it's there's left in me amen amen brotherr okay let's continue brother how many you say glory to God to the word hallelujah are we doing good till now we just read that there is enough power in you to create a world and live in it see what the prophet says today we don't have to to pray for more power Lord give me more power to overcome Temptations what you need is to be born [Music] again you have enough power to create a new Earth what we need it's faith for that power amen Amen brother don't ask for more power all of God's power is already in you ask for faith faith is revelation so you know and realize how much power there's in you okay Hallelujah are we in one agree Accord that we cannot make a world world and go live in it Amen brother if not we wouldn't be here who is still sticking to the things of this world okay all right well what can we do what can we do boy you are a new creation if you've been born again you are a new creation here is what God told me to tell you this morning here is where I almost finish hallelujah hallelujah we don't have the power forgive me we don't have the faith you already have the power but you don't have the exact Revelation yet to create a world right it's it's it's true but here's what God told me and I'd like to tell you maybe you might not have enough Revelation to create a world and go live in it but ask for Revelation so that in this Earth so in this world you begin to create atmosph a new atmosphere a new world in you here ask for revelation so you begin to create a world in this world yes brother you can build uh create a world here we're creating we're creating already Heavenly places with Christ Jesus we're already create a world here an atmosphere that is not contaminated with the edting of Satan can we say brother we live in the edting of Satan you're not being involved in the Son of God is light the Son of God lives and it's like a city where there's light believe create your world here do you believe it do you believe it Create Your Atmosphere Brethren you can do it if you have enough Revelation it can come out of you an atmosphere where you can see things differently I am a new creature as in in as much I will begin to build a world in this Eden of San I'll Make a Garden of Eden here because the Garden of Eden is God is already living here the devil does not live if you are born of God God is in you God Lives in You and God cannot dwell in darkness God does not dwell in God lives in in as much begins to build uh create your atmosphere and one day one day you'll say brother I created my world there I began creating my world here but I finished and it's there bye later yes the Son of God has the potential to create and begin a new atmosphere as our Pastor said in this Eden of Satan we live in the world but we're not of the world we're from another kingdom I have a king and he lives in this Kingdom am give an Applause to the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ I'll be closing with this verse Revelations 211 the musicians can come up amen and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw I John saw s the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven I I need to say this I need to say this what are Heavens what does the prophet speak of Heaven at Heavens are atmospheres okay all right well then let's put here and I John saw the holy city there's a city Brethren New [Applause] Jerusalem descend from God out of atmosphere keep reading out of coming down from the atmosphere of God okay prepared as a bride adorned for her husband I'll have to speak of this verse later but there's a bride there's a city there's a New Jerusalem and everything begins here the Rapture comes from the inside the prophet said everything comes from the inside your new birth comes from the [Music] inside everything comes from the inside Amen Brother begin to create on the inside this city this New Jerusalem amen who was in this city who was this New Jerusalem it was the Bride of our Lord Jesus Christ adorned adorned for her husband there's a bride that's preparing herself now there's a bride that's preparing herself she's adorning herself with the dress of the Bride the bride has a dress the dress is the word and the message of the hour she is dressing for her husband although the world despise [Music] her although the world put her aside think of her as [Music] nothing Bri is preparing herself a bride is edifying a city a world where God [Music] dwells would you like to build this world why don't you stand in let's worship God a few [Music] moments I hope you took something today if you didn't take anything take this
