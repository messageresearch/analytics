sharing with us I believe it's a miracle is mentioned some things about the church and what's going on with them let's read there in John 11 28. and when he and when she had so said she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the Masters come and call it for thee hey Noel as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him this is now Jesus was not yet coming to the town but was in that place where Martha met him the Jews and which were with her in the house and comforted comforted her when they saw Mary that she rose up Paisley and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there Maria cuando llego Jesus then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have you laid him they said unto him Lord come and see Jesus Jesus wept then sir the Jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore again groaning in himself coming to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it Jesus Jesus said take away the stone Martha the sister of him that was there Satan to him Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead for days believe thou should see the glory of God says Jesus then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I think see that thou has heard me oh yes and I knew that thou hears me always but because of the people who stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me yeah and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth sudario and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave Claws and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go when Jesus resurrected him he didn't resurrect him for the that entire time throughout that entire time he had an illness until he died when Jesus resurrects him he didn't resurrect him he resurrected completely whole and he lets us know everything Lazarus went through era para La Gloria was for God's glory so God would be glorified and we believe everything our brother John went through foreign [Music] foreign bendiga Mass to you even more what a blessing I'm privileged to be here on this beautiful night be patient with me if I speak a little bit the situation but we asked God to help us and re-establish my speeches like the pastor foreign amen amen we thank the pastor for this privilege this blessing to be here I'm very happy beloved I

understand Brethren that the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather until the further ends of the Gospel so that my Bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places El Senor es and many of the brethren in the Lord waxing Confident by my bonds to speak the word without fear yeah God has been glorified and I give glory to God for the trials no I say thanks thank

someone thank you also yeah thank you amen it's a great pleasure to see Brothers I feel my heart is too excited thinking about what God has done with me visit him in Aurora and you see him now a couple months later we cannot deny what God does we're ready to disconnect him as he said [Music] they didn't see any possibilities but God makes a way where there isn't amen amen uh let's read there in the book of numbers as you are nor some of you might not Wednesdays it's a Bible study normally apocalypses and regularly we've been speaking on Revelation in specifically iglesiasis specifically the seven Church ages of Revelation now we're going to put that aside number one for hearing brother John also there's other things happening in the church and what we're going to speak is for every member um if you're visiting God bless you uh I hope this is and frying you something out of the norm uh hopefully you can receive something numbers seven this is and I came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the Tabernacle and had anointed and Sanctified it and all that instruments thereof both the Altar and the vessels thereof had anointed them and Sanctified them and today that the princes of Israel heads of the House of their fathers who were the princes of the tribes and were over them that were numbered offered now I'm going to read it faster now friends [Music] and they brought their offering before the Lord's covered and 12 oxen a wagon for two of the princes and for each one of one and ox and they brought them before the Tabernacles is saying take it off take it of them that they may be able to do the service of the of the Tabernacle of congregation and thou shall give them unto the Levites to every man according to a service um foreign for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed even the princes offered their offering before the altar and his offering was one silver charger the wait thereof was 130 shekels one silver ball of 70 circles after the Shrek of the sanctuary both of them were full of fine flower mingled with oil for meat offerings one spoon of 10 shekels of gold full of incense and for sacrifice of peace offering talks in five rounds five he goats five lambs of the first year this was offering of not Sean the son of Amina dab is on the second day Nathaniel the son of zor Prince of issachar did offered Plateau de he offered for his offering once over charge of the way whereof was a 130 shekels one silver bowl of 70 shekels after the shack of the sanctuary both of them follow Farm flower mingled with oil for a meat offering one spoon of gold of 10 shekels full of incense one Bullock one ram one Lambo the first year for a burnt offering um offering and for sacrifice of peace offering to walks in five rounds five he goes five lamps of the first year this was offering of Nathaniel the son of zor system you continue reading this chapter you'll realize mentions every item these princes gave um does anyone know is the longest chapter in the entire Bible uh and and and more than 100 verses speaking what God's word is almost our entire chapter is on God's word I don't believe it's a coincidence it's the longest chapter okay I believe speaking of God's word is one of the most important things and it does deserve the longest chapter of the Bible of God's word is over God words what God's word the second longest chapter of the Bible hear me you should know right okay this is I've mentioned it before foreign second longest chapter in the Bible is this one Numbers chapter seven what is this chapter if you read it you might get bored principles it's naming every item every prince offered porque Dios Tanta tantos why does God need all this space here to name the offerings of these princes I believe if he wrote it there is because it matters to God is importante because it's important what matters to God Numbers Chapter 7 is the second longest chapter in the Bible and I don't think it's a coincidence I think God is trying to tell us something importa that it matters to him [Music] what a son or daughter of his gifts to him no I know when we speak these things we got a little uncomfortable yes as well I'm not a fan of speaking about money and those things unfortunately for some of us the Bible speaks more about money and what it speaks about heaven or hell so and speaking about money I'm speaking the word of God is that fine with you I want to give you a little bit of backstory and where we are um what is headed our way and God's will as you know I say s 10 years ago actually 11 years now relocated us to Colorado [Music] and we arrive without not knowing anyone is my brother Marcos would cook breakfast for me uh eggs with sausage is there a this place was even still too big for us um as the pero um God hasn't left us a purpose for moving here when we moved we took a step of Faith was a great step of Faith yeah I'm gonna say greater than a step was a great leap we prayed a lot for that decision prayed and Christ prayed and cried we cried a lot all of a sudden we get scared but we believed and we're sure it was God and when we moved we found out with time that God brought us here with a purpose or many Souls moved us through many signs and we were sure it was God I believe 11 years later we can say it's worth obeying God we're taking a step of Faith making a sacrifice you can say it's worth making a sacrifice God hasn't left us and blessed us amen amen I think it was 2017. if I'm wrong correct me please stay there's been many problems uh he also the neighbors of that property uh um the famous George Familia and his family he is not sure what's going to happen the 18th of this month 18 or 19. we have a meeting with our lawyers and their lawyers and try to have an agreement somewhere foreign and expand this place at a good price um is [Music] this is a report so we've given them an offer this is 750 000 770 000. sorry 70 770 000. este Para a realtor the realtor told me that someone gave him a verbal offer the cash okay of 750. so we want her to offer more than one of them would have to get a loan uh Anton says so we offer them [Music] also have another offer written down so far they have our offer and someone else's offer pero the Realtors said that they liked us and they're considering our offers the board of directors who get together and decide which offer they want from now till Sunday they'll have maybe more offers that's the first part let's say they accept our offer enters then the next phase is to make sure we can get the loan I spoke with some banks that was Fargo I was a Wells Fargo Banker Banks they usually don't help be involved in those things I went to two other Banks and they're open to helping us with the loan and Don says um uh [Music] there's other people responsible um seeing our situation and finances the they're trying to make sure that we can receive a loan all right as possibly now it's possible on down payment they might require a down payment [Music] they said for a church it can be all the way up to 30 percent and I tried to make it 25 percent for the cost of the church can go is 20 but maybe 25 um Lando if someone does a math 25 of 770 is how much uh 190 about 190 right price is um speaking about 190k uh so you give a down payment for the loan [Music] but what's likely is that we might need to give a deposit to get the loan so when we speak about figures like this we all get nervous we all get very nervous um Para para parallels using our money to pay for the lawyers and engineers and everything else is so we have to almost raise all this money uh entonces you guys have a high chance the building where you'd have seen it the biggest problem would might be just parking lot there's a lot of parking around um can you put some of the pictures 56 um is there this is [Music] it's like a bow it's like about 20 000 square feet you know what happens he was going to choke with the amount of money we're gonna give pero um they're about 20 000 square feet and for a perspective everything that we have here [Music] kitchen the rooms we have 3 300 square feet so we're talking about multiply this is how much more spacers over there um so we're speaking about a great church and 70 770 is a gang into bargain or bargain forgive me it's a very good night for these measurements many of the buildings the size are around 2 million and they're even smaller um this is another smaller Sanctuary they have next to the main sanctuary um okay I think easy 350 people only in the sanctuary about 400 when you fit chairs in it's them conference rooms Library rooms rooms for children restrooms and everything else um he is a lot of space you can get lost it has a basement the same size as the sanctuary another room on top of that not just the sanctuary the whole building this basement um so um assistance I want you to prepare this is the way God leads us if they accept a different offer he he is that's all I believe God has everything planned here and everything else so it's not stopping us we're going to keep working but if they accept our offers we're gonna have to move quickly so come up with that money this is 192 000. 192 500. um um hold on the these so now there's no plans of selling the properties [Music] we can keep using it as a fellowship foreign El Primera obstacles the first obstacle is the second will be qualifying for the loan and the third one is the deposit the down payment all right with me okay um we're not speaking of any numbers we struggle to raise 25kland speaking about a different place in different country it's our place in our city is the future of our children everything else Anton says um let's say okay if we divide 192. and 60 men let's say that foreign and it's not so complicated Anton says um uh [Music] is everything for us um so I warn you with this I I advise you but uh so you can prepare porque sinus because if they accept our offer in and we qualify for the down payments so inside of 30 days 30 40 days have that down payment ready Anton says um something to pray about something that you meditate on um and if God does not provide it was not his will law foreign that's the case brother um and I just received a good news to know God's given you a beautiful church and I saw you in God's love and the faith we should already have impossible I know it might seem impossible all things are possible speak the word yes and that church will be yours Korea so I believe okay considencia nothing is a coincidence there are many things I point that God's moving how God showed us this church before we spend money here we haven't signed the contract here yet we're ready to move uh God is awesome so they're sending more souls so I don't think it's a coincidence I believe God is moving now it's only up to us then we are aligned in God's plan knowing we're doing God's will um live one thing I've always told you okay my brother Brandon God does not owe anyone the Bible says in Galatians so he shall reap Port Antonio if there is one thing God does not forget that's what we do for his work you know where we are but everything is everything else is up to us I tell you this is building a church today it's more than a million and a half and let's say we decide later today as he came in yeah not more than six yes we are more than six years not everybody works yes I'm especially just seeing our brother in that work daily jobs um [Music] later you can ask me directly if you like pero is I hope you're excited because I'm excited one way another side but God's moving remembering that we need something amen I pregunta like her write down a question if they accept our offer yeah I'm gonna ask for another visit so we can all go yesterday and visit the church um so now those who have gone I've heard good comments uh and they are also excited again um let's just sing one song will be dismissed qualifier that we can do this we can do this amen okay uh um cash um you can use a credit card to donate there's no problem um but it's not a lot because we've been using it for everything with the lawyers and the engineers and giving payments everything else we definitely cannot depend on those um oh no because there is [Music] hi [Music] please [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] hello I [Music] am yours damn again [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen iciones we're going to be reading the petitions okay to the lawyers we have been paying them every time they charge us um foreign if we decide to rent another place we're talking about eight thousand to ten thousand dollars a month those are the buildings that we have been looking at we're talking about eight to ten thousand dollars a month in cambios so if we get this loan um we're looking at about six thousand dollars a month in tons is e e yes and that's something that's going to remain constantly mucho um a lot more space than what the buildings offer nowadays [Music] and then the things that we have to do to this place we're talking about fifteen thousand dollars so you can just have an idea um there's a lot of possibilities and there's many different ways and I believe between everybody we can give an idea let's put as an example of the acceptance offer we let go of this this opportunity and we're not going to know when when is the next time because there's not a lot of churches especially in that condition um I'm going to be reading the petitions may God take her and bring her back safely amen let's be praying foreign thank you um we're happy to have brother Hector here with us um is the esteviernes this Friday we're going to have a service a little difference it's going to be a worship service and we want to come with a desire to worship so the desire to worship the desire is simply to come to come with a good spirits and say Lord I am going to come and work very Brothers have been preparing so the service it's going to be different there's going to be some sitting in the back and then in the middle we're going to make a circle for those that want to get a little deeper into the worship um and to create that atmosphere so that's this Friday um [Music] that is this Friday our heads is if you have a petition that you weren't able to write it and you would like to identify by raising your hand and you can do it Orlando and we're going to be praying okay gracias thank you Heavenly Father for another day that you have granted us Lord gracias Padre thank you Lord foreign and you will
