[25:51] chose
[25:54] a war is near Proxima
[26:00] you know Gideon was a man of Valor era
[26:05] you know what does Valor mean
[26:08] you know it means qualities of a hero
[26:12] you know and it's a a person with her
[26:16] heroic courage
[26:20] when he is facing danger
[26:24] especially in battle especially
[26:33] he
[26:35] he God called him
[26:39] because he knew that he was a man of
[26:41] Valor
[26:42] is
[26:44] you know he was full of Courage
[26:47] but if we look at verse 13.
[26:51] you know he says he says he said but
[26:55] Lord but if the Lord is with us
[27:02] why why has this all this has happened
[27:05] to us
[27:07] where is all the Wonders
[27:11] there are ancestors told us about it
[27:16] he is talking about his his ancestors
[27:19] which was the Israelites when they took
[27:21] him out of egyptus
[27:25] but the Lord is has abandoned us he said
[27:31] foreign
[28:31] love those we go to people's homes
[28:34] you know we see it boom right there in
[28:36] somebody's wall
[28:38] you know God is the same yesterday and

[28:46] see it boom
[28:47] God is God is the same yesterday today
[28:51] and forever
[28:54] you know it's something so common
[28:56] you know God God is able to help if God
[29:00] was able to do something for them
[29:03] and be able to help Gideon you know how
[29:07] much more can he do with us
[29:13] thank you
[29:15] sometimes we say there is no way God can
[29:17] use me foreign
[29:51] see young man Holiness and young woman
[29:55] you know we make mistakes
[29:58] you know but God wants us to be men and
[30:01] women of Valerie valientes
[30:07] you know God wants to use us in great
[30:10] ways
[30:12] see if he is the same God that was in
[30:14] Genesis 1 1.
[30:18] he is the same guy that is here today
[30:25] that's
[30:26] in judges 6 23 it says
[30:30] and the Lord said unto him peace be unto
[30:34] you thee and fear not that you shall not
[30:36] die
[30:40] you know
[30:42] he told him
[30:45] he told Gideon
[30:47] go down where you know go burnt those
[30:51] altars
[30:55] wait sorry I I messed up
[31:02] talk
[31:04] he he went and told him go burn those
[31:07] don't go tear down those altars of Belle
[31:09] is
[31:11] he went and did that before he went to
[31:14] work
[31:16] he went he went and did that before he
[31:18] went to battle foreign
[31:42] foreign
[33:22] it doesn't matter what's going on in my
[33:24] life
[33:25] it doesn't matter about the doubt that I
[33:28] have no important it doesn't matter how
[33:31] what the circumcised look what the
[33:32] circumstance look like
[33:36] but you have to say God
[33:39] you need to use me necesitas
[33:43] you know you have you have to just go

[34:27] what God wants
[34:28] you know today I was I I wanted to sit

[34:34] you know but I remember what I needed to
[34:37] do for God
[34:39] and that's to give a war to the enemies
[34:45] you know you're not going to take me
[34:47] from these things of this Earth
[34:49] You know sometimes that's what we need
[34:52] to do
[34:53] we just don't need to let ourselves hold
[34:56] back
[34:59] you know we're men and women of Courage
[35:01] almost Hombres that valentia you know
[35:04] God just just didn't chose us just to be
[35:06] just anybody
[35:08] you know God chose us to be someone
[35:10] special
[35:12] to be Warriors of God
[35:15] and to fight for God
[35:19] I want to read this quote
[35:24] every innocence from it from to a mighty
[35:28] to a mighty mighty man of God a man of
[35:31] Valor going down to deliver look at
[35:33] Gideon what happened yes sir he going
[35:37] down with a crooked with a crooked state
[35:40] to take over a nation he did it yes he
[35:43] did
[35:44] God told him to no matter how unreal it
[35:48] seems
[35:49] you just know what God tells you to do
[35:52] and you'll find out that that his word
[35:55] is still the same
[35:58] is
[36:16] you know we just have to it doesn't
[36:19] matter how unreal it seems
[36:22] how much we say oh God can't use us
[36:27] it doesn't matter we have to trust in
[36:30] God
[36:32] and know that his word is the same
[36:35] it doesn't matter how unreal it seems
[36:40] we just gotta trust ourselves in God
[36:43] and say God you're going to use me
[36:51] if God used one man
[36:54] you know to gather those soldiers
[36:57] you know how much more can God use you
[37:04] we just have to give our courage
[37:11] God just use me
[37:13] you know it doesn't matter what the
[37:15] world says about me
[37:18] it doesn't matter how much I fail
[37:22] just know God can use you
[37:27] just know that God can use you and he
[37:30] will help you out
[37:33] that's all I have for today Brothers
[37:38] [Applause]
[37:48] God bless you
[37:49] man it's always good to be in the house
[37:52] of God Amen
[37:53] and if we can open our Bibles to the
[37:56] Book of Judges chapter 6 verse 11.
[38:06] I'm gonna go ahead and read it
[38:09] and there came an angel of the Lord and
[38:12] sat under an oak which is was an ofra
[38:14] that pertaining to joash the abyss right
[38:17] and the sun Gideon thresh wheat by the
[38:19] wine press to hide it from the
[38:21] midianites
[38:37] and one more verse in the book of
[38:39] Galatians chapter 5 verse 7.
[38:46] it says
[38:49] you did run well who did hinder you that
[38:52] you should not obey the truth
[38:57] [Music]
[39:00] amen may God the blessings to the
[39:03] reading of his words
[39:06] amen so we see here in the in the verse
[39:08] that we just read
[39:12] Palace who hindered you okay
[39:19] what stopped you
[39:21] what kept you from going further amen
[39:26] and in the case
[39:28] you find that he was in a place of
[39:36] comfortable to his situation
[39:41] he knew that each year that they were
[39:43] going to come and take all that he
[39:49] hasn't figured that he just might as
[39:51] well prepare for it amen
[39:56] and you find that when you're in a place
[39:58] of comfort
[40:01] when you're in your comfort zone
[40:04] your mentality is narrow
[40:09] we uh
[40:14] you're in you have tunnel vision
[40:18] amen but God isn't going to give you
[40:20] Eternal Vision
[40:22] God wants to show you more of what he
[40:25] has
[40:27] sometimes we're so narrow-minded with
[40:29] what we want amen
[40:33] sometimes we're so narrow-minded with
[40:35] what we want
[40:37] but we don't see what God has for us
[40:41] and that's a dangerous place to be yes
[40:46] I think it's the most dangerous place
[40:50] if you want to progress amen
[40:53] amen because Comfort is the is he is the
[40:56] worst enemy of
[41:00] Progresso why because nothing gets done
[41:02] when you're coming
[41:06] being being comfortable leads to no
[41:08] growth
[41:11] I I was reading and as I was researching
[41:14] Comforts
[41:19] I read a quote that I really liked
[41:24] amen and it says it feels good to be
[41:26] comfortable
[41:29] no flowers grow there amen Christian
[41:32] Flores where there's no struggle
[41:34] Brothers there's no growth
[41:38] amen and your comfort zone is
[41:40] essentially designed to make you feel
[41:42] okay
[41:47] amen and perhaps Gideon didn't feel 100
[41:49] safe in his neighborhood
[41:55] I mean since he was hiding you know
[42:00] amen he didn't he didn't really have a
[42:02] desperation though
[42:05] you didn't have a desperation to change
[42:08] his living circles
[42:11] by living under the rule of foreign
[42:52] it
[42:59] was like separating the grain the edible
[43:02] part of the plant from the from the part
[43:03] that you can't use
[43:10] and what we can take from this
[43:14] is that God starts with the little
[43:16] things amen
[43:19] Amen brother Brown says in the message
[43:21] God projecting his love
[43:24] um
[43:25] brother Brown says we are taught
[43:30] it's not the big things that we do
[43:34] it's the little things that we leave
[43:36] undone
[43:38] hey man I know personally for me it's
[43:42] not praying in the mornings amen
[43:44] I know that it's hard for me
[43:47] sometimes I wake up in a good mood you
[43:49] know energized
[43:55] and I I go down to pray
[43:58] and I fall asleep for 15 minutes
[44:01] or my legs fall asleep
[44:04] what happens you know and uh or it's not
[44:07] uh spending adequate amount of time with
[44:09] God amen
[44:12] amen all it takes is 15 minutes to
[44:14] change your life
[44:16] I don't know about you but I think it's
[44:18] a pretty sweet deals
[44:22] for 15 minutes for uh an eternity with
[44:25] him amen
[44:28] amen or maybe it's not Consulting god
[44:30] with any any decisions you make
[44:35] no matter how big or small they are
[44:37] important
[44:40] amen into thresh is essentially to
[44:42] separate
[44:45] so you're separating the grain from the
[44:47] plants
[44:51] amen and God found him alone
[44:54] amen because God was separating him from
[44:57] all the unbelief
[45:00] because at the time the people that the
[45:03] the people of Israel they they were they
[45:05] were believing in foreign
[45:38] [Music]
[46:07] amen so then we see that the Angels
[46:10] seeing something in Gideon that Gideon
[46:11] couldn't even see in himself
[46:16] and then we see that God sees much
[46:18] further than what we can amen
[46:22] amen and a lot of times I wonder um
[46:26] what if I understood the whole plan of
[46:28] God for my life
[46:32] um
[46:34] you know I feel like I wouldn't believe
[46:36] him then
[46:39] because I want to see how it would be
[46:41] possible
[46:45] you know how all that would happen you
[46:47] know
[46:49] but a lot of times it's not just it's
[46:51] not maybe not understanding amen
[46:55] just believe in God anyways
[47:01] that faith is when you can't explain how
[47:03] it happened amen
[47:11] amen we see that getting made all kinds
[47:13] of excuses about himself
[47:18] he said that he was incapable
[47:21] and God I'm sure that it made him feel
[47:24] bad when God told him he was a mighty
[47:25] man and he was hiding
[47:30] um
[47:33] but that just goes to show that when we
[47:35] make excuses
[47:37] God looks to make
[47:41] progression may have displayed himself
[47:44] as somebody that couldn't
[47:46] person
[47:49] qualities
[47:58] that just goes to show that it doesn't
[48:00] matter what anybody else thinks of you
[48:03] if you just keep your eyes on what he
[48:05] thinks of
[48:12] amen amen amen blessed be the name of
[48:15] the Lord
[48:18] amen
[48:19] God doesn't want you in a relaxed State
[48:23] [Music]
[48:25] because when you're in a relaxed State
[48:27] and this is foreign
[49:20] and I like what brother Branham says in
[49:22] the message I am the resurrection in the
[49:24] life
[49:27] he says see just as soon as I believe
[49:32] he said he can't help me till I believe
[49:37] I've Got to Believe In confess
[49:41] and then God's under obligation to his
[49:44] words
[49:49] you can do all things
[49:52] foreign
[51:20] [Music]
[51:21] you need to start making some noise
[51:24] because essentially it was a noise that
[51:27] that won his first battle foreign
[51:53] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:58] amen and I want you to notice that in
[52:00] that story that they didn't profess
[52:02] anything of their own
[52:04] um
[52:10] to take his word with him amen
[52:14] amen so don't when you have her in you
[52:17] you're enduring a trial
[52:20] don't profess anything of your own
[52:23] profession
[52:25] don't try to go It Alone
[52:28] go to God
[52:30] go on your knees to him
[52:35] that's what he's there foreign
[52:41] [Music]
[52:44] right amen amen God bless you brothers
[52:47] that's all I have do you live
[52:51] [Applause]
[52:55] amen amen God bless you Brothers
[52:59] so happy to see you every one of you
[53:00] tonight is
[53:02] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[53:06] I just want to start off by saying
[53:09] no youth colonists you know we're so
[53:13] blessed to be here you know sometimes I
[53:15] gotta remind myself of this is
[53:20] you know you we're so blessed to be here
[53:24] because there are many young men and
[53:26] women out in the world
[53:29] doing drugs they were young young women
[53:33] over there being prostitutes
[53:37] there's a lot of addicts in over there
[53:40] outside
[53:45] that we are still here
[53:48] and we're still fighting
[53:51] you see and this is why we're different
[53:53] from the world
[53:55] because we continue fighting
[54:04] hey man I'm just gonna get right into it
[54:06] because I don't have a lot of time
[54:10] if you could please open your Bibles to
[54:12] Judges chapter 6 verse 13 and 16
[54:15] questions
[54:26] and it says like this
[54:29] said unto him
[54:32] oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why
[54:35] then is all this befall in us
[54:41] and where be all his miracles which our
[54:44] fathers told us
[54:49] saying did not the Lord bring us up from
[54:52] Egypt
[54:55] but now the Lord has forsaken us and
[54:58] delivered us into the hands of the
[54:59] midianites
[55:05] verse 14 and the Lord looked upon him
[55:10] and said go in this thy might and thou
[55:13] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[55:16] midianites have not I sent thee
[55:19] is
[55:25] and he said unto him
[55:39] and I am the least in my father's house
[55:45] and the Lord said unto him
[55:48] surely I will be with you
[55:52] tonight as one
[55:55] manitas
[55:58] amen amen
[56:03] amen ah man a war is rising
[56:08] approxima how many Believers are here
[56:11] tonight I recognize
[56:14] there is a war Rising
[56:18] the Bible says that God brought us into
[56:22] this world
[56:25] you see God brought us to a battlefield
[56:29] because we are soldiers of the Lord
[56:33] and
[56:35] one of the soldiers
[56:38] of the Lord
[56:40] which I want to talk about tonight which
[56:43] we are focusing on
[56:47] you know how our brother Felix said
[56:50] no giri was a man of Valor
[56:54] and which Valor means
[56:57] not afraid of fighting the battle
[57:00] foreign
[57:31] [Music]
[57:47] foreign
[58:35] amen amen
[58:37] and one of these tests
[58:40] was mirian
[58:43] itas the Bible says that this nation is
[58:49] risen up against Israel
[58:53] and the children of Israel
[58:56] had done evil in the eyes of God
[59:00] and because of that
[59:02] God Allah
[59:09] so because of this
[59:12] year after year
[59:14] the midianites would come in at Harvest
[59:17] Time
[59:19] and either take or destroy what was
[59:22] Israel because
[59:29] and you see and in this way
[59:32] Israel was so impoverished
[59:36] Israel was so oppressed
[59:40] in such a way to
[1:00:38] it was kind of hard to see this
[1:00:42] follow us because the people of Israel
[1:00:45] people who not only knew God
[1:00:50] people who not only had experiences
[1:00:55] I've seen the Miracles and wonders of
[1:00:58] God
[1:01:00] but for some reason
[1:01:04] the people forgot what God was
[1:01:09] you see they forgot they forgot the God
[1:01:13] who did Miracles
[1:01:18] who not only did wonderful things
[1:01:23] but who delivered them from the enemies
[1:01:26] and many of the times foreign
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:03:41] because the
[1:03:57] for what
[1:03:59] but what they were going through during
[1:04:00] those times
[1:04:11] that when they were at the point of
[1:04:14] having victory
[1:04:16] Victoria
[1:04:19] you see maybe we were about to see the
[1:04:22] the results of our prayers
[1:04:32] is a spirit
[1:04:34] is a spirit that comes to steal as soon
[1:04:37] as
[1:04:38] to fill our heart lives with fears
[1:04:42] you see that's why there's so many
[1:04:44] frustrated Christians
[1:04:47] that's why there are many brothers and
[1:04:50] sisters
[1:05:22] but we don't reap
[1:05:42] you see there is always something
[1:05:47] there is always something that steals
[1:05:50] our blessings
[1:05:52] is there anyone like Israel here tonight
[1:05:58] when we were about to have victories
[1:06:04] when we are about to have that Victory
[1:06:08] here comes in
[1:06:10] youth Communists Satan El Diablo always
[1:06:14] manages
[1:06:17] to to steal what belonged to us
[1:06:24] still our blessings
[1:06:26] this is what brother Brandon says
[1:06:45] he said then sir if God is with us
[1:06:47] where's all of his mighty Miracles
[1:06:53] the prophet told us that he was the god
[1:06:56] that brought us up out of Egypt
[1:07:02] he spoke to land he delivered us
[1:07:07] he's a god of Deliverance
[1:07:10] and if he ever was God
[1:07:14] he's still gone
[1:07:40] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:07:43] forever
[1:07:46] Jesus Christ
[1:07:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:55] you see Brothers
[1:07:57] the Israelites
[1:08:00] didn't believe in God's promises
[1:08:04] all they wanted to believe was God's
[1:08:06] blessings
[1:08:09] and they thought that because they were
[1:08:11] called Children of the Lord
[1:08:16] whatever they wanted foreign
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:09:16] foreign
[1:09:57] you see Brothers we are his instruments
