[27:02] we give thanks to god for the
[27:04] opportunity he's given us to be here
[27:09] and the pulpit that has been uh
[27:11] given to us this morning
[27:16] we get thanks to god our pastor for the
[27:17] trust
[27:46] for thus saith the lord that after 70
[27:48] years being accomplished at babylon i
[27:50] will visit you and perform my good work
[27:52] towards you
[27:53] and causing you to return to this place
[28:10] verse 11 says for i know the thoughts
[28:11] that i think toward you saith the lord
[28:13] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[28:15] give you an unexpected end
[28:20] this morning we're going to be speaking
[28:22] on the last days
[28:27] god has not finished
[28:42] these moments
[28:45] we put ourselves in your hands
[28:49] recognizing that we're insufficient
[28:53] we don't have the capacity to speak
[29:53] and what the the deportation of the
[29:55] people of israel to babylon
[29:57] babylonia or the people of israel being
[30:00] in babylon
[30:05] and we've just read here that they were
[30:06] about to have be 70 years
[30:10] god was preparing
[30:12] to do something
[30:14] with the people of israel
[30:45] [Music]
[31:28] not because he stuck his foot in the
[31:29] expression
[31:50] [Applause]
[31:58] is
[32:10] a different vision
[32:36] the first was in 605 bc
[32:38] irrecordamous de que
[32:44] we remember that daniel and the three
[32:46] hebrew man
[32:50] they were a part of that first exile
[32:54] and also the royal family
[32:59] and in that time jehoiakim was the king
[33:01] of israel
[33:04] if you read the bible you'll come across
[33:06] these names
[33:08] and to
[33:11] [Music]
[33:29] [Music]
[33:55] and not only him but the majority of the
[33:57] people came with in that in that second
[33:59] invasion with disease
[34:02] it was the greatest invasion that year
[34:04] paranthesis
[34:06] joaquin and at that time the king
[34:08] jehovah
[34:13] joaquin
[34:15] the first one is jehoiakim and the
[34:17] second one is
[34:27] [Applause]
[34:30] he came from israel and went to babylon
[34:41] i wouldn't call it a third invasion
[34:43] because there wasn't very many people
[34:45] implementing
[35:08] and the little people people that stayed
[35:10] there on that third exile
[35:14] the bible says that they fleed okay
[35:19] we have to go through these things
[35:22] because it's good
[35:24] to know where we're standing
[35:29] it's good to get excited but we need to
[35:30] understand the word as well
[35:40] and what everything that had that had to
[35:41] remain
[36:24] the purpose of
[36:50] and we prefer a different solution
[37:48] and because
[38:22] [Music]
[38:57] from the pagan palace
[39:12] amongst the
[39:26] is
[40:08] of israel
[40:20] and i tell you this as a little as a
[40:22] little nugget
[40:36] and the bible says that it was near er
[40:38] of the children
[40:42] amen amen
[40:49] psalms 137 the bible says
[41:05] the people that live in the second exile
[41:09] how much they have felt
[41:31] just think of the pain that these people
[41:33] were going through
[41:36] and the bible begins to say
[41:38] psalms 137
[41:42] by the rivers of babylon
[41:45] tamus
[41:58] that's right
[42:29] in the midst thereof
[42:35] when they played the harp there in
[42:36] jerusalem
[42:39] all that left them
[42:56] required of us a song
[43:00] the same people that had them captive
[43:01] cantatus alabanzas
[43:03] victoria sing your songs of victory
[43:20] [Music]
[43:24] that you sing
[43:38] saying a senior song is a victory now
[43:46] and they that wasted us required of us
[43:52] that's what the world does
[43:56] [Music]
[44:04] is
[44:32] sing us one of the songs of zion
[44:47] if i do not remember that you let my
[44:48] tongue clean
[44:50] in other words
[44:55] allow me to forget about zion
[45:02] they were thinking about
[45:13] [Music]
[45:27] [Music]
[45:44] the house
[45:56] no longer come to the house of god
[46:10] to forget what from where i'm supposed
[46:11] to be at that's right
[46:21] remember oh lord the children of adam in
[46:23] the day of jerusalem
[46:26] yes
[46:32] who said raise it raise it even to the
[46:34] foundation thereof
[46:37] in other words
[46:39] don't forget

[47:35] thy little ones against the stones
[47:38] in matthew 24 brothers

[53:59] there
[54:04] being 25 years of old ezekiel
[54:07] five years go by hermanos
[54:11] the people of israel had forgotten about
[54:13] jerusalem already
[54:20] but god remembers his promise
