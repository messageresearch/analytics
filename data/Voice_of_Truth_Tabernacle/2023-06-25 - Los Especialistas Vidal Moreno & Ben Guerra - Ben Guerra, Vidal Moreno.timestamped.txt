[28:35] God
[28:37] when you're in Fellowship
[28:41] there's nothing else that I can share
[28:45] I love speaking about it he's been with
[28:48] me
[28:50] I don't get tired of speaking about him
[28:54] we send greetings to our brothers
[29:03] may God bless them
[29:06] if you may open your Bible with me
[29:11] it's my turn to preach with our brother
[29:13] Ben amen it's a privilege let's open our
[29:18] Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4.
[29:23] uh verse 11 to 13 then versicolo
[29:33] it reads like this
[29:37] and he gave some Apostles and some
[29:40] prophets and some evangelists and some
[29:43] pastors and teachers
[29:49] evangelistas
[29:51] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[29:54] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[29:56] the body of Christ
[30:04] so we all come in the unity of the faith
[30:06] another knowledge of the Son of God unto
[30:09] a perfect man
[30:11] into the measure of the stature of the
[30:12] fullness of Christ
[30:15] is
[30:28] for the honor and privilege foreign
[31:10] would leave Lord satisfied
[31:14] satisfied because we heard your voice
[31:17] Lord when we give you honor and Glory
[31:20] yes in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[31:23] amen amen uh
[31:28] for a title
[31:30] uh brother Ben and I remember
[31:33] we uh we titled this we're a member of
[31:36] speech we're speaking on God's team
[31:40] and uh you know for title
[31:43] we were kind of in the same thought
[31:45] estamos he said something that I had
[31:48] already thought
[31:50] so we just went with uh for a title
[31:52] import
[31:53] The Specialist
[31:59] because I believe uh God does things in
[32:02] a special way
[32:04] and because we have a special God
[32:08] he has special people
[32:11] amen amen uh you know uh I I I uh I'm
[32:16] one of those people
[32:17] that I uh I enjoy uh you know I I want
[32:21] to talk about you know about our trip on
[32:23] Friday a little bit
[32:26] you know we went uh white water rafting
[32:31] you know what here at the poodle River
[32:35] yeah and then nobody ever done it before
[32:39] and uh I always always wanted to do it
[32:44] you know and uh it's just something
[32:46] about the waters
[32:48] you know I think every son or daughter
[32:51] of God
[32:52] there's something about those Waters
[32:55] you know that that just that just uh
[32:58] that just attracts the child to God
[33:01] maybe not physically
[33:04] but but spiritually
[33:07] that's that that's why we're here
[33:09] foreign
[33:43] [Music]
[34:03] it's gonna be my fault
[34:06] so I tried to stay calm and collected
[34:08] don't say this man okay
[34:11] um
[34:11] and uh and you know the the guys
[34:15] when they asked you know if that's the
[34:17] waters we're gonna go into
[34:20] when they asked him if those were the
[34:22] waters we're going to go into
[34:24] one more time when they asked if when we
[34:26] asked him if those were the waters we
[34:27] were going to go into
[34:29] Salos yes
[34:31] they said yes
[34:33] and uh they're like has anybody ever
[34:36] been white water rafting
[34:40] and uh and we all said no
[34:44] so they weren't worried
[34:47] so when I saw that they weren't worried
[34:50] I I wasn't worried either
[34:54] you know and I just kind of bring that
[34:56] you know to God's word
[34:58] see God called you
[35:01] and you know and if he's not worried
[35:04] you shouldn't be worried either
[35:08] you shouldn't be worried about what's
[35:10] coming your way
[35:12] we don't preach last year
[35:15] we preach God's truth
[35:17] yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be a rocky
[35:20] sometimes
[35:29] yeah there's going to be the waters are
[35:31] going to be you know are going to be
[35:33] hard sometimes
[35:35] the waves are going to come up
[35:37] and you know yeah we might get you know
[35:40] a little startled
[35:41] but don't worry
[35:43] because you were called for this
[35:46] we were all called for this if you
[35:49] weren't called by God
[35:51] I don't believe you would be here
[35:54] and it wasn't just any calls
[35:57] but it was a Divine call
[35:59] you see and when and you know we read
[36:02] you know about the fivefold ministry
[36:03] here
[36:05] you know I was reading you know and and
[36:08] it says in Ephesians 4. it says and he
[36:12] gave okay
[36:14] you know so when you give something
[36:18] you know it's it's a gift
[36:22] it's something that God
[36:50] he still called you to be here you see
[36:54] because the ministry that that was that
[36:56] this fightful ministry
[36:59] how do you know given by God
[37:02] is actually going to help build and see
[37:05] it's going to help build the church
[37:08] everybody that's here
[37:11] their faith needs to get built up
[37:15] it's going to be built up
[37:18] see God doesn't bring you here
[37:20] and he doesn't he doesn't he's not gonna
[37:23] tear you down
[38:12] you see when the man is preaching
[38:15] not only when the man is preached
[38:54] is it it's in the message the guide
[38:59] he says this he says the God isn't going
[39:03] to take you isn't going to take one over
[39:05] this way and one over that way
[39:15] he's going to keep you together
[39:17] and if we'll just let the Holy Ghost
[39:20] keep us together
[39:25] if we just don't let the devil pull you
[39:27] off on the wrong road
[39:32] says
[39:40] the Holy Spirit the guide of God that
[39:45] will guide us to all the truth
[39:47] that's right that's yes it says but you
[39:51] got to follow your guide
[39:53] you see we gotta follow our guys
[40:00] amen amen you see we're living in a very
[40:03] special time
[40:05] you see and the thing of it is
[40:08] for a very special time
[40:11] although it is a dark time
[40:14] I believe it's a special time
[40:17] you see and whenever you know we when
[40:21] whenever God calls us into this time
[40:24] I believe he has to have a Specialists
[40:29] you see a special operations
[40:33] special
[40:35] ops you guys know that play Call of Duty
[40:38] you know what I'm talking about
[40:40] you guys know the play Call of Duty you
[40:43] guys know what I'm talking about
[40:46] you see so you know a special time
[40:50] requires a special people
[40:53] and not to take away what's already been
[40:55] done
[41:28] [Music]
[41:54] with everything one of you
[41:57] say this oh because I believe that God
[42:00] didn't call us yes not to back out from
[42:03] this but to take a step back you know
[42:07] but I kind of get a rush
[42:11] but you know that that goes
[42:15] forwarding me
[42:17] when I see something that I enjoy
[42:19] we're not doing something in our life
[42:22] see when I'm building people
[42:26] something inside of me man just gets me
[42:28] going are you going through them because
[42:31] I could see I know there's more inside
[42:33] of you
[42:35] no do I know no but God knows see that's
[42:40] why he called you
[42:42] you see when we get all stirred up and
[42:44] scared
[42:47] I know you're sad and God knows that
[42:51] there's something else there okay you
[42:53] see this man right here
[42:55] this ain't the best
[43:34] you see everybody named in here
[43:40] is needed
[43:49] you see in order to take us
[43:53] to where we need to go
[43:56] we know we know we know that we know
[43:58] it's Apostles prophets
[44:02] pastors and evangelists
[44:04] you see it and if that's not revealed to
[44:07] you
[44:09] you ain't going nowhere
[44:11] because it's for the it's for the
[44:13] perfecting but the perfecting of the
[44:16] church
[44:17] if that hasn't been revealed to you
[44:20] then you're not gonna go where you think
[44:22] you're going
[44:24] because this is God's word it's not mine
[44:28] that's what God says and he said it
[44:31] through his Apostles
[44:33] amen amen we're just we're just helping
[44:36] out we're just doing our jobs
[44:39] amen amen Amen
[44:43] brother Burnham says this is
[44:47] talking about a guide again
[44:50] he says now what God knows where he's at
[44:54] says regardless of the weather
[44:56] you see he's equipped to do that
[45:00] he knows what he's doing
[45:02] he's familiar with everything
[45:05] he knows the looks of everything
[45:08] so he could just be in the darkness
[45:11] and he could feel any certain things
[45:16] you know when you have that kind of guys
[45:20] because I think that people can can see
[45:25] when somebody scared
[45:28] and when they're not sure
[45:30] when they're not sure
[45:33] what's happening I believe people can
[45:36] sense
[45:39] and you know when we were getting on
[45:41] that raft
[45:43] I was watching the guide
[46:00] and you know it was there was not a
[46:03] doubt in my mind
[46:05] you know that he was a man of God
[46:07] you know and that he and that God was
[46:10] with them you know God's with his people
[46:14] provide his leadership
[46:16] he's going to provide the help
[46:18] but you have to be willing
[46:21] to accept him
[46:23] to accept him
[46:26] even with his faults
[46:29] I still believe God
[46:33] that doesn't mean anything
[46:35] we're all going to make mistakes
[46:40] you see when you recognize that we're
[46:44] all human beings and we all make
[46:46] mistakes
[46:47] we all get scared every once in a while
[46:50] you know then you're on your way
[46:53] you know instead of criticizing oh we
[46:57] should help you shouldn't do something
[47:00] at times you know the reason that you're
[47:02] criticizing
[47:04] it's because you ain't doing anything is
[47:07] it because if you did something
[47:09] you wouldn't have time to criticize you
[47:12] wouldn't have time to criticize the
[47:13] sisters
[47:16] you know you're going to get criticized
[47:18] either way
[47:20] you know if you work out
[47:23] you get criticized because you work out
[47:26] and if you didn't work out
[47:29] you would still get criticized
[47:31] so if I'm gonna get criticized I want to
[47:35] be found doing something for the Lord
[47:38] that's it yes that's what I want to do I
[47:42] want to be create a phone to be
[47:43] criticized
[47:44] I want to be criticized for doing
[47:46] something for the for the Lord foreign
[48:18] [Music]
[48:31] as as we were when we got into the rafta
[48:38] our guide was the one that was steering
[48:40] from the back
[48:43] he was the one that was steering
[48:55] it was just if he told me if he said if
[48:58] he said forward too
[49:04] then you would row two times
[49:08] oh there was a moment in our raft
[49:12] I know what was going on in somebody
[49:13] else's
[49:16] but there was one moment in our raft
[49:21] he saw that that you know the people
[49:24] were startled
[49:27] and he starts
[49:34] and you know some people were just
[49:36] locked up
[49:39] they didn't do anything
[49:42] the thing of it was
[49:45] Nosotros
[50:42] the people El Pueblo the the people that
[50:46] that you know that have positions here
[50:48] in the church
[50:50] we're just doing what God told us to do
[50:53] you know but uh
[50:57] although you may not preach
[50:59] that doesn't mean you're not a part of
[51:02] God's team
[51:04] but that doesn't mean
[51:07] you may not have you know the job of
[51:10] somebody else
[51:12] but that doesn't mean
[51:14] that you're not a part of the elite
[51:18] that's right that's yes you know the
[51:21] elite or the Specialists
[51:24] they're all they're all one
[51:26] we're all one you were apart
[51:30] of a very special team
[51:36] by the Holy Ghost
[51:38] you know and although the times
[51:43] sometimes you don't feel like Rowan
[51:48] sometimes old man you might just have
[51:50] the world will grow just one time
[51:54] that could make the whole difference
[51:57] it could make the difference in the life
[52:00] of somebody
[52:01] if if you just if God calls you to do
[52:05] just one thing
[52:06] you see just just do it they do it with
[52:10] all your hearts does he do it with the
[52:12] best that you can
[52:13] I don't do it so that somebody can see
[52:16] you again but do it because it's in your
[52:22] heart to do it because God put it there
[52:25] you see because in the end
[52:28] that one thing that's one thing that you
[52:32] did
[52:32] they make the whole difference in the
[52:35] world
[52:38] to that one person you see you don't
[52:42] know you don't know who you're helping
[52:44] sometimes
[52:45] you see there's one guy in the Bible
[52:48] and it's Andrew yes Andres you know
[52:52] Andrew they don't talk a whole lot about
[52:53] him
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:12] foreign
[54:19] thank you brother Vidal for beautiful
[54:22] words
[54:24] for the Titans for a beautiful message
[54:26] this morning
[54:29] amen thank you for the confidence that
[54:31] you would have in us to speak behind
[54:33] your sacred desks
[54:37] how are you this morning
[54:41] it's low cold in here
[54:44] so what's the problem
[54:48] are we not moving around enough
[54:51] matter are we not giving God the glory
[54:55] amen I I know Friday was it was hot in
[54:59] here
[55:01] amen and I know God's Spirits here
[55:04] and I know he has control
[55:07] do you love him
[55:11] you think it's by some coincidence
[55:15] that you're here this morning
[55:20] why did you come this morning
[55:23] asking God for
[55:26] say that again asking the Lord for okay
[55:29] or did you come for no reason
[55:33] proposito did you come because they made
[55:35] you come over again
[55:37] did you come under some obligation
[55:41] you know we come in expectations
[55:46] that's our part
[55:49] then God has to do his part
[55:53] and you say what if I was made to come
[55:56] to church
[55:58] you know many times the parents are
[56:01] doing what they're told to do muchas
[56:05] what the word says
[56:08] and many times many of us came to church
[56:11] that way
[56:15] but it just took that one service
[56:19] that I did not want to be in service
[56:24] that's something
[57:23] you conquer the end
[58:24] the scripture says will he find faith
[58:30] when he returns
[58:33] so this group here this morning is
[58:37] he going to find faith
[58:41] now you could say you have faith
[58:45] now let's test it this morning
[58:48] yes
[58:53] is there anything too big for guys
[59:00] you know many times we come
[59:03] and we ask the people
[59:06] are you sick
[59:09] well you know the reality
[59:11] if you weren't sick is
[59:15] thinking
[59:17] well maybe I am
[59:21] but you know if God heals you today
[59:26] you're probably gonna get sick again
[59:30] but let's look a little bit further
[59:33] if God finds your soul today see
[59:39] dioses
[59:41] you're never going to be sick again
[59:45] spiritually it's something that changes
[59:51] he's not an Indian giver
[59:55] he's not going to take it back
[59:58] but the brothers were talking about
[1:00:00] something
[1:00:02] they said when we come to second service
[1:00:05] on Sunday
[1:00:08] they said there's not room for the
[1:00:10] people
[1:00:11] they said some of us has to wait back
[1:00:14] there
[1:00:15] so what's the problem
[1:00:18] what's the problem
[1:00:21] of a little dispute going on
[1:00:25] where's the face
[1:00:28] where's the Fate this morning
[1:00:33] there's nothing impossible if you need a
[1:00:37] church say that again if you need a
[1:00:39] church
[1:00:40] you've got to speak the word of God
[1:00:43] because there's no more people
[1:00:46] that could fit in this place
[1:00:49] now the problem that I see
[1:00:52] we can't find any more souls
[1:00:56] wow
[1:00:58] right brother yes
[1:01:03] Manos
[1:01:15] we say pray about it
[1:01:18] but that's not what God Said
[1:01:23] what did he say
[1:01:26] come on help me out here
[1:01:30] what'd he say
[1:01:33] says speak the words
[1:01:38] many people are afraid to speak the
[1:01:39] words
[1:01:42] because you know why they're afraid
[1:01:44] because they're afraid it's not going to
[1:01:47] come back
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:01:52] and then they say wow you know people
[1:01:54] are going to look at us
[1:01:57] like if we're not Believers
[1:01:59] because it didn't come to pass
[1:02:01] you know what Abraham waited 25 years
[1:02:07] that's all that people see is
[1:02:10] they say 25 years
[1:02:13] I can't wait that long it is
[1:02:19] oh 25 years we have plenty of time for
[1:02:21] it to come to pass oh it is
[1:02:26] but there was something great
[1:02:29] it's not the greater that took place
[1:02:36] but you see something happen
[1:02:39] you see one day
[1:02:42] Abraham he was sitting in bed
[1:02:46] but then he wakes up
[1:02:49] and he sees his wife
[1:02:51] and he has to look again
[1:02:57] know what's going on here
[1:02:59] he saw a young lady
[1:03:02] that was laying right next to him
[1:03:05] it's just that calling God on the scene
[1:03:09] you believe every word
[1:03:13] that comes out of God's word
[1:03:17] you believe every word
[1:03:32] why are we afraid
[1:03:39] why are we afraid
[1:03:44] whatever you need this morning
[1:03:52] Don't Be Afraid
[1:03:54] don't be afraid
[1:03:56] you know we we we don't need a lot of
[1:03:59] time this morning
[1:04:01] words
[1:04:04] it's what God has in store for you
[1:04:08] there's a lot of things that have taken
[1:04:11] place
[1:04:13] and I'm tired of waiting
[1:04:16] I'm tired of making excuses
[1:04:21] but I want gosh
[1:04:24] you'll be manifest before
[1:04:29] church into existence
[1:04:40] we had an agenda here
[1:04:42] but God canceled
[1:04:46] we were going to talk about the book of
[1:04:48] Ezra
[1:04:49] but let's talk about it another time
[1:05:14] and they said let's build
[1:05:18] let's build a temple here
[1:05:21] a temple that they will never forget
[1:05:28] that if their children
[1:05:32] and their children's children
[1:05:34] forget who God was
[1:05:38] let them remember this day
[1:05:42] let them remember
[1:05:45] that's your God your church
[1:05:48] God called into existence
[1:05:52] remember this day
[1:05:58] and the scripture says
[1:06:00] we're not talking about a sacrifice
[1:06:05] we're not talking about a temple
[1:06:09] but that they may remember
[1:06:12] where they came from
[1:06:15] they wouldn't forget
[1:06:19] there's a lineage here okay
[1:06:23] but what things happened
[1:06:25] what things were so great foreign
[1:08:33] he trembles
[1:09:23] will not forget
[1:09:25] a
[1:09:34] this team has more than this than this
[1:09:37] church
[1:09:39] there's a fightful ministry that's been
[1:09:42] worldwide
[1:09:45] they laid the foundation
[1:09:52] of evangelists
[1:09:54] teachers
[1:09:58] for our strength
[1:10:00] so you say what's happened brothers
[1:10:09] and his name was William Branham
[1:10:12] and he laid the foundation for us
[1:10:17] there was a time that
[1:10:19] his existence gets through existence was
[1:10:23] in dangerous
[1:10:28] yes brother what are you doing say that
[1:10:30] again yes brother what are you doing
[1:10:33] we're raising your faith this morning
[1:10:37] because I can't ask you to have faith
[1:10:41] now we put it in God's hands
[1:10:45] God this morning
[1:10:47] he's going to raise your faith
[1:10:50] because water the prophet of God says
[1:10:53] what is the hardest thing to do
[1:10:57] come on
[1:10:59] I okay
[1:11:03] I can't hear you brother another child
[1:11:05] hey you gotta say it like you mean it
[1:11:09] come on brother you got it
[1:11:13] no no no I don't believe that
[1:11:16] you got to get me to believe it
[1:11:20] don't look around don't look around I
[1:11:25] want you to believe it this morning I
[1:11:27] want you to stand like you believe it
[1:11:29] come on brother
[1:11:33] foreign
[1:11:41] it's impossible for one man to believe
[1:11:44] another did you all hear that this
[1:11:46] morning
[1:11:47] now we're starting to believe
[1:11:51] for one man
[1:11:53] to believe another man
[1:11:55] I believe that man I don't believe he
[1:11:58] believes this man
[1:12:01] now let's call God
[1:12:07] we want to think it's an emotion
[1:12:11] so don't get confused while we're doing
[1:12:13] this morning
[1:12:16] there's a difference between faith
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:51] so there was a time
[1:12:53] that the prophet's existence
[1:13:08] you see this nation
[1:13:12] was built upon the promise of God
[1:13:15] foreign
[1:13:39] and when they lay that foundation with
[1:13:41] with the Israelites
[1:13:45] and they said
[1:13:47] every generation we don't want to forget
[1:13:49] what's happened at this place
[1:13:56] now now let's let's bring it to our
[1:13:59] nation
[1:14:00] I know as a nation
[1:14:03] God closed the door for us
[1:14:07] and as individuals we still have a
[1:14:09] chance
[1:14:12] but you know the prophet was not here
[1:14:15] yet
[1:14:18] but his existence was in Jeopardy
[1:14:23] why do you say that brother
[1:14:26] because the prophet of God talks about
[1:14:29] George Washington
[1:14:30] George Washington he said he was at
[1:14:33] Valley Forge this is
[1:15:19] Jesus let me seek the Lord in prayer
[1:15:22] foreign
[1:15:47] Josue
[1:15:55] and he said wait a minute
[1:15:59] God promised Joshua the only problem
[1:16:03] that now one man would be lost
[1:16:08] he said if that same God Did It for
[1:16:11] Joshua he says
[1:16:13] he said he could do it for me
[1:16:17] and in his hand yes
[1:16:21] they went on a promised land
[1:16:27] they came back with the fruits
[1:16:36] then he could do the same for my mind
[1:16:43] and that's why this nation stands today
[1:16:46] yes
[1:16:50] that's a very touching story
[1:16:54] but without that happening
[1:16:57] we will never receive the prophets
[1:17:05] wow amen
[1:17:10] that he could turn his phone off after
[1:17:12] five o'clock
[1:17:16] but when you're having your parties
[1:17:23] for this congregation
[1:17:30] for the abomination of the people say
[1:17:34] that again for the Abominations of the
[1:17:36] people
[1:17:37] he's the one that cries
[1:17:45] so many times it may seem easy
[1:17:49] but they're the ones crying
[1:17:57] stay life in this place
[1:18:01] so they went back
[1:18:05] and they found the clothes of George
[1:18:07] Washington
[1:18:10] George Washington and they had bully
[1:18:13] holes
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:50] no but it's you mamas serado
[1:19:50] beautiful
[1:19:56] I want to say a prayer for this church
[1:19:58] Iglesia
[1:20:02] it's not know some
[1:20:04] coincidence that we're here
[1:20:13] you know there was one of our elders at
[1:20:15] the church had
[1:20:16] had made a comment to me
[1:20:23] he said why do you like keep on going
[1:20:25] back to Colorado
[1:20:32] and you know
[1:20:35] sometimes you find the love for the
[1:20:37] people
[1:20:41] you don't know why
[1:20:45] but you know the love Is Just
[1:20:47] I love this place I love this church
[1:20:50] I have a really close buddy here
[1:20:57] Vidal
[1:21:00] you know why I like to fellowship with
[1:21:01] the brothers
[1:21:07] because I feel like when I'm with him
[1:21:11] I feel like we're Joshua and Caleb since
[1:21:16] why do we talk about brother
[1:21:21] we just talk about God's words
[1:21:24] you know that's the joy we have
[1:21:27] you can ask our wives
[1:21:30] they're out doing they may be shopping
[1:21:33] or whatever and we're sitting on the
[1:21:34] side of the street just talking about
[1:21:36] God's word
[1:21:40] we talk about the dumbest things
[1:21:45] but then we figure out how God's word
[1:21:48] has to do with it
[1:21:52] that's why I love this place foreign
[1:22:07] I don't know
[1:22:09] but the brother has a pure love inside
[1:22:11] of him
[1:22:14] so there's something that pulls me to
[1:22:17] this place
[1:22:20] people don't got to understand it
[1:22:23] God draws me here
[1:22:32] is
[1:22:41] we didn't even touch on anything
[1:22:45] because there was a deep calling to the
[1:22:47] deal
[1:22:49] I believe with all my heart
[1:22:53] he's going to give you your church
[1:22:56] and I don't believe you're going to have
[1:22:58] to wait 25 years
[1:23:02] but you got to believe it
[1:23:05] let's go to the Lord this morning
[1:23:08] remember it's not an emotions
[1:23:13] her gracious heavily followed
[1:23:17] Lord you know my heart this morning
