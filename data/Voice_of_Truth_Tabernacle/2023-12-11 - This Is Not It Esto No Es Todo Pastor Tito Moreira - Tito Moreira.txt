angry and he prayed unto the Lord and said I pray thee Oh Lord was not this my saying when I was yet in my country therefore I fled before unto tares for I knew that thou are a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and our great kindness and repentance thee of the evil therefore now Lord take I beseech thee my life from me for it is better me to die than to live then said the Lord doest thou well to be angry uh Jonah had a high temper very angry so Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city and the Lord God prepared a gourd and it made it come up over Jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd but God prepared a warm when the morning Rose the next day and it smoke the gour that it withered and it came to pass when the sun did arise that God prepared a vemon East Wind and the Sun Beat upon the head of Jonah that he fainted and wished himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live and God said to Jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourd and he said I do well to be angry even unto death then said the Lord thou Hast had pity on the gourd for that which thou Hast not labored neither mest It Grow which came up in a night and perish in a night anales and should not I spare Nineveh that great City where are wherein are more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and left hand and also much cattle let us pray Heavenly Father we give you thanks Lord for one more opportunity you give us come to your Holy Temple Lord and worship you that's what we were made for that's what you made us for Lord to come and worship you Lord not just here in church but anywhere we are you deserve the best from us Heavenly Father we don't want to give you a halfway worship we not form people Lord we want to be people that are hot people that give everything for you in this morning Lord to show you how much we love you while we hear your word may our hearts be open to your voice Lord our spiritual ears be open to hear you Lord and answer true worship our God is still alive that our God is still real that our God is in our midst that we don't serve a dead God we serve a present God a god of today a god of a God of this moment in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated we send greetings to our brothers in that are watching us may the Lord bless them and God bless you here Vicki and her family anyone else watching worldwide we're happy to be here brother I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord the subject we are taking on is on the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and we've been speaking on the resurrection and we've taken the Book of Jonah so learn more about death and Resurrection because Jesus himself did it Jesus himself took Jonah's story talk about his own death and Resurrection he said just as Jonah was in the belly of the well for three days and three nights so shall the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights so God took the story of Jonah to tell us more of the Resurrection it's not easy to bring a lesson from Jonah's life Jonah was a very odd character but I believe in the odd is where God is where the strange things are that's where God is because God is a stranger God and God's children are odd although you don't believe it you are an oddball Oddball believing this message coming to church on in the weekend when you could do other things we're oddballs and his children are oddballs and Jonah is an oddball I see a very odd man at the same time I see a very angered and frustrated man the Bible says that in the latter days this is second Timothy chapter 3 and verse two and the latter day says for men shall be lovers of their own selves CET boers proud disobedient parents unth thanful Unholy without natural affection says truth Breakers false accusers then it also uses this word also incontinent says Fierce despisers of those that are good when I read these things I notice this age these latter days would be a generation that was would be frustrated an angry generation and truly we're living in that time we see everyone unsatisfied angry and frustrated we are a generation that's unsatisfied I see Jonah and I see him unsatisfied I see him very bothered frustrated I see him as a man that was not happy I think it represents our time of our age an unsatisfied generation unsatisfied marriages unsatisfied parents with their children bothered with our sisters with our brothers don't tell me it's not as a pastor I see it people seem as time goes by more the more Angry we get anything gets us angry anything bothers us anything makes us look like we're fired up with the person we're bothered with our church we're bothered with our pastor you say brother Titus people are always bothered with me bothered with the brothers bothered by this bothered by that and why are we so bothered I think that's the question God ask Jonah why are you so bothered so unsatisfied why is there so much anger in you and the Bible said it that in the latter days there would be Tru Breakers that's the spirit of this time we see Wars all around why are there so much War why there many people that are angry we look at Israel and what they're going through such an angry people with them everyone around them want to kill them want to annihilate them why is there so much hate why is there so much hate we see the people everyone has their own opinion some saying that Israel is wrong because they're defending because they're killing children because they're killing women but they don't realize the only way to destroy an enemy is by not having compassion and others say that Palestine is wrong Hamas is wrong everyone choosing signs you look around the world everyone's choosing everyone is bothered by something and I look at in the spiritual World everyone is bothered by something gone a spirit of unsatisfaction and anger but you know what the children of God also must have a grown in them there should be something where they're not satisfied I say there are signs of the end time they are signs something is not right in this life the Bible says Romans 8 verse 15 I'm going to skip for the moment verse 20 because the creature itself also shall be delivered be delivered from the bondage of corruption and the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travelleth and pain together until now forgive me for we know that the whole creation granth and travelleth and pain together until now I believe if there's a groan if there's unsatisfaction it's because there's something better come on church I believe if there's unsatisfaction in US there's a Gran inside us because there's something better aren't you glad to know there's something better this world is filled with unsatisfaction the Bible says that the days of man are bitter are unsatisfactory that's right am and the closer we get to the end time the more dissatisfaction there will be and more groaning there should be in God's children should be a groaning in God's children to know and say I want to be delivered I want to be delivered already this world can't give me what I need this world satisfy me not what I want when I see Jonah A little I think I think there was a great dissatis action inside him because he didn't understand what God was doing he didn't understand God's plan maybe he was bothered because he did not see God's justice maybe he said God where's your Justice n Assyria n was the capital of Assyria of the country of Assyria Assyria would be such a dreadful enemy to Israel it was a perverted place a Place full of wickedness even n's own King tells them to the nites leave your evil when they heard Jonah's message the king said leave your evil the king recognized how much more God it was such a Savage place maybe it wasn't so much a strange thing for Jonah to say Lord where's your Justice have you ever asked Lord where evil so much wickedness in this life so many things that shouldn't be the way they are come on church I'm speaking to a body that knows that knows this body this world that knows that our life our life is filled of mistakes the people make so many mistakes and you ask yourself God where's your Justice why are things this way you ever ask yourself the question why is it this way why did my life have to be this way come on church just look at your own life sometimes the devil fogs our vision sometimes he why does God allow you to go through this no no yes or no Brethren is that not isn't it that way that's why we're so unsatisfied because we can't understand God's plan we say why God why didn't you give me what I asked why didn't you make me go through this why this sickness I ask myself what brother John do oh I'm sorry I think brother John I see that you've asked yourself Lord why why have I been needing to go through this I believe we have all last ourselves real for a moment if Jonah was something at least he was honest Jonah asked him are you angry he said I'm very angry at least he was honest and many times we don't realize we don't want to say like but there's something inside us that is unsatisfying that's why sometimes we've given up many people that have given up they don't want to keep F they don't want to fight they come to church and they just do the minimum come on church and do the Min many of us given up on God we've given up on the church up in our [Applause] situation because we've told ourselves why why God why are things the way they are Jonah had a short Vision he wasn't seeing what God was God's plan to destroy nin do you know it was fulfilled 40 years later God did 40 years after Jonah preached then God destroyed n so God is not a liar God knows what he's doing he doesn't have to explain everything to Jonah to say look this is what I'm planning but Jonah was bothered because he didn't understand God's plan many times we are bothered and unsatisfied why because we fail to notice that this isn't everything this is my title this isn't this is not it there we go this is not it this is not it is not tell your neighbor this is not it I believe if God told Jonah this Jonah would have had a different perspective if God said Jonah this is not it don't be angry I have a greater plan I'm not showing everything to you this is not it your neighbor tell your neighbor this is not it what God will give us this is not it let me tell you brother need to tell the devil this is not it we need to have a revelation this morning need to let that frustration go we need to let our thoughts be clear for a moment while we hear God's voice this is not it sometimes we are disappointed with ourselves Amen brother sometimes we're disappointed but God tells us this is not it sometimes the devil tells us oh how sorry for you you have to answer Satan this is not it not what I should be yet I am not what I will be that's right this is not it this is not it if there's an unsatisfaction is because this is not it brother brandham in one occasion he says uh the message Moses the message blind B I was combing what few hairs I had left on my head uh speaking with with his wife she said to me Billy she said you're getting baldheaded honey I said I know sweetheart but I haven't lost a one of them she said what I said I haven't lost a one she said where are they at and I said I'll tell you something sweet you might not know if you'll tell me where they was before I got them I'll tell you where they are waiting for me to come to them they were somewhere is that right wherever they was they're waiting for me and then he says a new body is waiting there someday not only for me but all that love his appearing that's right someday the old Mortal will take away and the immortal will take it place the sorrows and sickness heartache will fade away to a new body I want you to see see while we worry for this one while we worry for this one because we haven't realized of what's to come because when we understand there's something coming that this is not it that this is not it this is not my reward this is not my true life this is not my reward so I shouldn't put so much importance because this is not everything PR is to come is on the other side is waiting for me I don't have to worry I see a very worried Jonah a plant a gourd That Grew he got so attached to it we got attached to the things of this world when they are temporary things and we notice that when we lose when things don't come out the way we want when they leave us when they fail us we get so angry so sad when the brother lets us down when the pastor isn't what church isn't what it should we get angry we get frustrated but God is teaching us he wants to reveal to us don't worry for that is not your reward that is not it it's not what I want to give you don't worry the brother fails press on fails Press On press on press on don't be attached to that not what I want to give you I have a new body for you cancer don't worry SI don't worry your bones worry don't worry not the true one this is a lie a lying vanities Jonah said this is not it this is not true there's a new body waiting tell you there's a new body waiting for are you happy for that there's a new body waiting for you brother brandham says the sorrows and the sickness the heartache will fade away to a new body Health forever and in the presence of God won't that be wonderful then we'll all have one big happy birthday won we celebrate it forever until that time may God smile his richest blessings upon you until that moment endur in other words till that moment comes we forget we come to be tested we forget that this is not heaven repeat this is not heaven this is not heaven we forget that Jonah forgot happy with the gour he wasn't happy when God saved the nites he wasn't happy when God thought about them but when the gourd grew he was so glad let me tell you Jesus Christ do not be gladdened by the the demon subject he said Rejoice our Nam are WR Book of Life someone can give you ,000 get glad someone can give you glad over that lose that or later or later there something else waiting for [Music] you let me tell you this I want you to understand this the world will never be enough the things of this world will never be enough I'll repeat that I want you to understand you won't look for the resurrection how many want to be in the resurrection you need to look for it you need to understand this world will never be enough this world will always disappoint you I don't care who it is how it is what they give you this world will never be enough chch I'm waiting for someone to acknowledge that this world will never be enough wife will never be enough my husband will never be enough my brother will never be enough never ever [Applause] ever so don't get attached don't get attached to it it's until we recognize here's the point it's not until we recognize that the best is yet to come it's until we recognize that The Best Is Yet To Come then what we have now will be enough I'm going to repeat that it's until you recognize that The Best Is Yet To Come then what we have will be enough The Best Is Yet To Come say The Best Is Yet To Come come on brother tell the devil The Best Is Yet To Come the devil can only last so long just three days and three nights and The Best Is Yet To Come the days of the devil are waning my days are just starting hallelujah oh Hallelujah the days of the devil are ending they're the last days for who for the devil for SI for sickness they're the first days they're the first for the children of God The Best Is Yet To Come God has only given us the down payment say God has only given me the down payment and brother bradam says and if this is the down payment what will it be when we have everything if this is the down payments what will it be when we get everything oh this is enough to say to say Lord I will keep fighting a down payment is

brother bram's wife is here she is uh dying and she's on her deathbed and brother Billy calls her and she said why did you call me why did you call me Bill I said what do you mean she said oh I was so

an Orient and big birds a flying from tree to tree said it was such a beautiful place you know what I think I think God let her break into Paradise just as she was going over and she said you know Bill that religion we have been talking about since we received the Holy Ghost and I said yes she said don't never cease to preach that she said stay with that she said that's the thing and I or what is the sister saying here she is telling brother Billy Billy you know what we preach that of the Holy Ghost that that you preach about the Holy Ghost that is what will bring us here that is what will help us get there never stop preaching that says don't ever cease to preach that stay with that oh brother if we should preach something it's the Holy Ghost if we should preach something it's the Holy Ghost we can all speak psychology Earth bless jobs and everything else that will not satisfy I will not take you over there but you preach the Holy Ghost the Holy G what the rest can't the Holy Spirit can take you to Eternity the Holy Spirit you see why the dev wanted to separate him from the Pentecostal he didn't want him to go preach to the Pentecost because they believed in the Holy Spirit they believed in receiving the Holy Spirit brother Bram was sent to the he was sent to preach the Holy Ghost he was sent to tell us nothing of this Ro will satisfy us but the holy spirit is enough that is what your soul needs it's what C your it's what tranquilizes US until we make it there and I said honey if I would have probably listened she said yes Bill she said now look honey I am going fast but
