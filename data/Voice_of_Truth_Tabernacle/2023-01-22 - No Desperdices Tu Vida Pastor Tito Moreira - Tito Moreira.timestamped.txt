[35:31] transgressions from us
[35:36] like as the father pitted his children
[35:40] I'll be focusing in verse 14.

[1:07:44] the Bible says who doesn't sit down
[1:07:47] before building a building
[1:07:49] and calculate the cause
[1:07:52] start today
[1:07:55] many of us are waiting for something

[1:09:14] planifications
[1:09:22] that you never did anything
[1:10:21] and say here in my Lord
[1:10:28] that exists
[1:10:36] whether Brandon says
[1:10:39] about Moses
[1:10:43] many times we're afraid of making
[1:10:45] mistakes
[1:10:47] but Moses
[1:10:53] he says I give more to someone that
[1:10:55] tries
[1:10:59] I give more to someone that tries
[1:11:03] than someone that never tries
[1:11:09] we can say Moses was a failure to begin
[1:11:16] again
[1:11:20] was part of God's plan
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:36] want to use them

[1:16:29] lives have been wasted
[1:16:35] to lose everything
[1:16:40] that's the truth foreign
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:18] all right
[1:17:24] what are we doing
[1:17:28] we wasted too much why do you want to
[1:17:32] wait longer now okay
[1:17:37] do something
[1:17:46] he doesn't want nibblers
[1:17:50] who doesn't want people I'm gonna try
[1:17:52] this here try that
[1:17:55] people that aren't committed
[1:17:58] David
[1:18:00] was committed
[1:18:03] all the great men that did something for
[1:18:05] God we're committed or surrendered
[1:18:10] crazy but he was committed Jose
[1:18:16] um
[1:18:55] there was another family
[1:18:58] foreign
[1:19:03] they died of old age and said
[1:19:08] I spent a great time in my life
[1:19:11] collection
[1:19:14] I collected all the baseball cards I've
[1:19:16] wanted
[1:19:18] and I spent most of the time
[1:19:21] that's a tragedy
[1:19:48] what difference did they make
[1:19:51] um
[1:19:56] that's why people can't find happiness
[1:19:58] because
[1:20:00] happiness is only found
[1:20:03] giving everything for God so I there's
[1:20:07] joy
[1:20:08] when you surrender everything is
[1:20:19] I won't Reserve anything
[1:20:22] don't give a true commitment Lord
[1:20:26] to something that's worth it
[1:20:33] God wants people with a passion
[1:20:36] compassion with a passion
[1:20:40] I know that their Joy is in the Lord
[1:20:45] we don't have to be complaining
[1:20:48] throughout my life
[1:20:52] it's a waste of time to be angry
[1:20:59] here
[1:21:08] you could do something good
[1:21:25] for the Eternal things
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:33] God wants people with a passion
[1:21:37] if it's worth it it's worth to give
[1:21:40] everything
[1:21:59] this Chinese boy said Mr Taylor I have
[1:22:02] felt that my call in Christ
[1:22:16] my Bachelor of Arts and then go for my
[1:22:19] PhD and all I have to have my doctor's
[1:22:22] degree
[1:22:25] Mr Taylor said go now son
[1:22:28] say go now
[1:22:34] don't wait till that time comes
[1:22:38] you'll waste away too much of your life
[1:22:43] I think that's right
[1:22:46] I agree with Mr Taylor
[1:22:48] he says go now
[1:22:52] I'm not trying to support my ignorance
[1:23:01] for Education Without salvation
[1:23:22] if you don't know nothing no more than
[1:23:24] how we got lived yeah
[1:24:26] do it now Lord
[1:24:48] I'm closing with this now
[1:24:52] God wants us to be happy in what we do
[1:24:56] God didn't call us
[1:25:01] look that will be our greatest happiness
[1:25:06] the soul
[1:25:08] tiene
[1:25:11] Feliz has something that makes it happy
[1:25:14] yes
[1:25:16] and that is fulfilling God's purpose
[1:25:20] it proposal principal and the main
[1:25:23] purpose is
[1:25:26] Distributors of the purposes of Our
[1:25:29] Lives it's to give glory to God with our
[1:25:32] lives
[1:25:36] and God wants that not because he has a
[1:25:39] great ego no Perkins
[1:25:44] not because he enjoys it he does like
[1:25:47] that glorify him but because he knows
[1:25:50] that that is where our happiness is
[1:25:55] used to our fullness
[1:25:59] won't be wasted
[1:26:02] we will take the greatest risk
[1:26:05] if our life is
[1:26:09] basic because we haven't had Faith it's
[1:26:12] the truth
[1:26:23] and let me tell you life will stop being
[1:26:26] basic
[1:26:30] Ally estamos
[1:26:36] but many times we're sados angry
[1:26:42] because we're not doing what we want
[1:26:49] it
[1:26:51] let me tell you this David had a dream
[1:26:55] he was a man of Dreams
[1:26:59] or spiritual
[1:27:02] s
[1:27:04] he had a dream to build God a temple
[1:27:09] no one asked him and who says
[1:27:17] but you know he came out of David's
[1:27:19] heart to do this
[1:27:21] God didn't ask David to build the
[1:27:23] temples
[1:27:33] more from us
[1:27:36] what else can I do for you
[1:27:41] what else can we do for you Lord
[1:27:44] and He dreamed and said
[1:27:48] I want to build God a temple it's
[1:27:52] hard you know what God told him
[1:27:58] no David
[1:28:00] yeah
[1:28:01] I know it's a good dream
[1:28:18] not for a builder
[1:28:21] notos you know this so many times God
[1:28:25] tells us I didn't call you for that
[1:28:27] and we don't want to do anything else
[1:28:30] now
[1:28:30] [Music]
