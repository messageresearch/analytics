[Applause] [Music] amen [Applause] [Music] how many are happy to be here tonight how many can say God's love is so great amen [Music] um I just want to say this real quick um he says the main thing is love God and he also says and humble yourself amen um it's oh it's very good to be here again once again and then just team you guys man I just want to thank my pastor brother Tito just for giving us the trust in me my brother's here are brother Emmanuel and our brothers amen um if we can just open up our scriptures in this night to Proverbs 22 4. man when you have it may you please say Amen this says like this it says the humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life is amen Lord gracious Heavenly Father Celestial Lord we just want to give you thanks Lord we're letting us be here tonight and for allowing us Lord to just glorify and honor Your Name Lord hope my brothers and sisters Lord are you also and hope me and my brothers Lord our brother Emmanuel and our brother Isaac Lord may we just let ourselves aside Lord my words are nothing Lord yours are what matters Lord important thank you Lord just take control of this service [Music] you may be seated so as I was just um I was beat or I got asked to preach and um well I'm like a shy person so I'm not that comfortable with like just speaking but the Lord just knows what he's doing um I just want to speak about uh humbleness um I think that we are sometimes just need to just be humbled in life sometimes we go above ourselves and we just think that we're better than everyone else is that's not the case [Music] um I just want to start off by saying what humility humility means humility means forgiving loving and caring for others just yourself and then it also says humility also means letting God take charge of your life and whatever we can't do he will significa is I just really like this because if we want to be humbled in life we need to learn how to forgive um I think that's very important because every time we get spoken to or anything that just comes in our way it's really hard to forgive our brothers um I just want to read a quote from brother Brandon here and get the message humble myself it says and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around okay it's used um sometimes we have that arrogant Spirit come at us then we don't know what to do we just wanna insult our brothers and well brother Branham also says if they're all wrong don't you ever build don't don't you never build up a conflict against that Persona it says you be sweet and kind and then I like what it says here it says remember God loved you when you were in your sins it says and if the spirit of God's in you you love the other person when he's been wrong um we we sometimes just um let that arrogant Spirit just come at us and then we forget how to be sweet and kind amen um but if you really want to be humbled just like God worked through you but I'm just use you amen amen um as well I just want to also speak on loving um um as we read here said loving your brother yes they're wrong um sometimes we just don't want to love them sometimes we probably always want to be right correct um hello subtypes your brother may be right and you're just wrong and then you just don't want to love them you probably always want your way and um if they're wrong you just feel good about yourself just because you were right don't don't feel that Spirit now no no no no no no no no amen amen there it says here this is a key faith is the substance it says you see a man humble and loving and good to his neighbors this is and a good citizen a good fellow and a good man and a and a Christian man full of love and humility Christianity it says you watch that man says that's right he is good charitable long-suffering it is you can talk about him it's all right he forgives you don't make any difference to him Brothers Hermanos sometimes it's just something says something to us and then it just all of a sudden just wakes on us and then we just start acting like a bunch of um well just we don't think right at the moment amen he says you you can talk about him but it says it's okay because you just forgive you sometimes you just have to have that humbleness in ourselves when someone talks about us we just got to keep it humble forgive them and just don't let it do any different unto you okay just keep that same humble spirit in here then sometimes oh hey this is um we think we have humbleness in our lives but sometimes we we either fake it um I think that when we fake it it's just it's just really like I would just say it's more you wouldn't be able to love your brother why because it's on the outside that's your that it shows that you're being humbled um then when it comes to uh um when it comes to like an actual uh to be around one another Persona and then someone says something to you it may it may not seem like it hurt on the outside but on the inside you probably want to kill your brother and I think that when we want to kill our brother we just let ourselves not get controlled over by the Lord right there was this one preaching that I was listening to um it was by our brother I think his name was brother Fred Mullins I think Fred Mullen he says that the devil can use you just job's wife they hope when job's wife said why don't you just curse your God then he says then he also says that um that's when Faith started pumping up you know this was um he says you speak like one of those foolish um and um I think many times the devil starts using us because we let ourselves be used we don't have that humble spirit and um there's just really many other things that just comes against us sometimes we just don't see it he says this is um I also want to read this other quote it says you know people want power and really they don't know what power is because they really don't know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Powers see how humble you can get um just get away from Mario worldly thinking and humble yourself before God apart and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise so see because you have you have uh bent over to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ to humble yourself before him that's really power it is now let me tell you in this night if you want power from God let's just see how humble you can get um sometimes we want to be on top and then Garth just brings us back down sometimes we want to be on top but we don't know how to act uh and sometimes we just need humbleness is the only way up is down you want to have real humbleness just just love the Lord um as well as um okay it says um it says so always he that humbles himself God will exalt Joseph he that exalts himself God will bring to a base he'll bring him down always keep humble and be little in your own side is says be little in your own sights don't think of yourself as someone great man because then once you think of yourself something great then that would just take over you and then when you go out you think you'll be something great but your in reality you're nothing man it says no matter what God does for you just see how much more humbler you can be all the time the more God blesses you just keep getting more humble all the time hey man sometimes we we receive something and we just go out and just think that we have it all and brother says that's not the case can you receive more you gotta be more humble you got to be more humbleria amen amen just as you can get something uh physical in life and then you can go out and think you have everything already but you just just aren't humbled I guess at all no no no no you just won't be humbled if you think you're all this and that no no no even spiritually if you if you receive something you have an experience with God and you think you have at all but you also don't you don't have it man you just gotta keep being more humble in other words don't be a showa hey man just whatever God gives you okay just be more humble it says just keep getting more humble all the time and one more thing it says I like I like it when it says like just keep getting more humble or all the time God will continue to bless you as you keep getting more humbler he says he can continue to bless but when you get to a place that you think you haven't got it you're on your road says that's right you lose your influence amen um I'm gonna be closing now and um I just want to read this verse in this last quote here it says in Luke 14 11 says for whoever exalted himself go ahead shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted then it also says in the in the same message says you show me a church that's humble he says not an arrogant church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and the power of God he says that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God and letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise and then you don't have to make a lot of noise all you got to do is just keep humble vendiga [Applause] God bless you brothers and sisters saying more on we chose our brother Luis is preaching for that again I feel like we need humbleness to even listening to even talk up here I remember uh last Wednesday you know I was like feeling ill uh and I I see that I get a text from Brother telling me if I'm ready you know I told him yeah but I am feeling better for a minute there my sickness did go away and then I came back uh no I think God sent me that sickness because I didn't know what I was gonna say up here you know a couple days later about Jonah and I read his story and I feel like all of us have a piece of him stand up yeah or and if you could turn to your scriptures on Jonah 1. verse one two one four one verse oh no no and may you say Amen when you have it now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amiti saying arise go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me is but Jonah rose up to flee into tart tarshis and from the presence of the Lord and went and down to Joppa and he found a ship to go to tarshis so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them and to tarshis from the presence of the Lord you may take your seats as you see here that Jonah was called to go to Nineveh and speak his word but instead of doing that he went as far as he could but I said I feel like a lot of us being caught for something and we just run from it and uh you know sometimes we run to to word to which is to money to just the world we just try to get as far as way as it could and uh I don't think that's fair for God sometimes he has to send a storm to us just to get us back and when that doesn't work he sends a big fish that's right no as uh Jonah was in that fish for three days and three nights he cried out a prayer for God pretty much repenting himself and uh as he was repenting it doesn't tell us why he ran away from Nineveh yet no this is and uh you know uh God that's spoken to the fish to vomit him up and uh brother Brandon says that he says that Nineveh was a place of millions of people and he had to bring the word to that is when I first read uh Jonah it was like a long time ago I thought he was uh just because he was afraid but that wasn't the case I think he was just being selfish because it says that he knew that God was merciful and he was graceful and that kind of made me laugh when I first read that yes how would you not want her to be merciful he just saved you from that fish right there no and you know what we run from him and we run to the devil with open arms and the devil loves to pervert yes you know there's like schools in Ohio escuelas in Ohio that have uh satanic clubs crazy how the devil just works his way in anything you know I did go to a Christian School and even there you can run from the devil yeah that again and even there you can run from there yeah you could run to the you go to the restroom and nine times out of 10. you know there'd be like smoke coming out of a stallion not because they were a fire but no we're smoking uh I wasn't like seventh grade this girl in my class yes was giving a kid from the 11th grade beer alcohol that just shows that you can't run from the devil [Music] no he can run from God foreign [Music] 9 11 came and they made like bigger fences no no only people with with papers and come true and I feel like that's how we are with God now first we put a pile of rocks then we only let like prizes and things he'll give us they shouldn't be like that though it should be open right no uh when uh came to Nineveh and when he preached his word the prophet said it was so great everybody humbled themselves and they all were like sackcloths it's an issue and even the cows Forum yeah Jonah was so mad he asked God to kill him no I thought that was like so crazy to me God just use it to save a hole who plays full of millions of people the personas and uh and you just want to be killed you use Nineveh was a capital of Syria and Assyria was pretty much Israel's enemy and you know when I first read that yes that's why I thought Jonah was scared to go foreign no I like to read a quote from the prophet is and it goes like this look at the prophets look at Jonah when he was on the road to Nineveh and taken a boat to tarshis he disobeyed God and he was thrown out of the ship and a well swallowed him foreign and he gave his prophecy so much professor with a city the size of Saint Louis Missouri over a million population some of them didn't even know right and left hand is and the street screaming with this prophecy like that until the people repented in such a way they put sackcloth on their animals animales oh and I think that's how we had to Humble ourselves as well you know he had to do what God has called us here we shouldn't wait for that storm to come because that storm is going to hit hard and I know there's a lot of testimonies out there of people who waited and I'm not sure they would like to do that again but but sometimes that storm does give us character's character and uh I thank God Kevin gotten to that point where I've been hit with that big storm I thank him for taking care of me wherever I go from school from Escuela know from even 4-H which is like a program where I a program the 4-H you know even in God looks for people for character uh no sometimes when I search for for a cow I have to look how straight its back is how it works you know and uh how it's even faced you know like how its legs are formada no you like even before they're young you could tell how big they're gonna get I will notice just by looking like above their legs and that's how God looks at us at us and he sees how how big our character will get yeah and we always have room to improved our Prophet says that the end times will be like Sodom and Gomorrah I believe in that time and I believe we're in that [Music] and are we just gonna keep running accordion Arena no because we had to chase God it's not okay we shouldn't be running from him because there's a point where the running stops where that dead end comes you're either gonna have to choose him or the world in this little life and it's not picking Avida for eternal life some people say they're wasting their time it's just this big of a life we have instead of eternal life so what are you really wasting is that's right I just like to leave you with this don't run from him but Jason that's my that's my time and thank you for your time [Applause] God bless you Brothers give me a few moments how are you this evening I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're grateful for the opportunity foreign first of all I want to thank everyone foreign [Music] he brought us very much at the stop of running pillars in the church and not be a burdened your personal Mente I personally in Spanish because I feel like I say with with more with more feeling I know that I've been a burden in this place at times I've acted like a virgin maybe you don't know but I confess it is but for this coming year yeah and matrimonial in marriage as the prophet says matrimonious the pillars are the marriages we all have our New Year's resolutions we're going to do it we're going to exercise that's everybody's Federal hide anything from him [Music] without socks or shoes [Music] before you enter they asked if you had a heart conditions or cholesterol or those types you could enter into that place so said you struggled to wake up to get up to be on time but as our brother Eduardo says it's all in the mind amen amen we have to have our bodies subjects not the mind to the body yes so as um I don't know if that helps somebody but I took it in the spiritual sense because I have a problem that I don't believe at all foreign [Music] [Music] it was just a man that was going to put on the horse he said open your arms everything at all you have to be in service service [Music] ready for service just judging on the thought of pillars so you can understand me I'll just let the prophet um express Philadelphia and he says in the in the Philadelphia Church you have it in Spanish yeah yeah they said now he is not only giving crowns but he says that these and the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God but what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body being as a temple it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us now he is going to make the Overcomer a pillar in that Temple and then he asked what is a pillar but okay a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the super structure is right yeah in English says superstructure and unless this is not just a building it's a superstructure so he says that puts the Overcomer right in with the apostles and the prophets for it says in Ephesians 2 19. for therefore now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone fundamento de los Apostles now that might have been a lot for the younger youth this is we are God's body here and God's body needs pillars we need people to support the superstructure God's plan God's body and that is that is my goal next year yesterday I I want to be a pillar not a burden no I don't know um if anyone has that same feeling but in closing we understand that there are things that get in the way and then the musicians can come you may stand there will always be there'll always be problems there will always be trials there'll always be battles but second Corinthians 4 says hi for a light Affliction which is but for a moment what you're going through okay what I'm going through is a light Affliction and it's just momentary working for us to far more exceeding and internal weight of Glory with every fight Gloria we we are we become heavier in glory Gloria you carry weight of of glory and where you're going through there's nothing too big for God there's something that the one thing only God can't do yes and that is fail and as our brother Emanuel said Diablo you came flee from the Devils Diablo you can't flee from the dead he will always be attacking but I believe as a soldier you should face him although the problems in the in the trials may come they may feel like War but there are warriors here okay although you may not recognize you don't believe it like Warriors here amen not only Warriors but for warriors or the Free World we are free in Christ and free Warriors and they don't have Rivals like our Lord Jesus there's no Rivals there should be no rival for his dirt his children and if you're not a free Warrior you can begin the Year Con Liberation with the freedom or Deliverance is we all need more Deliverance I need deliverance we need to Humble ourselves as our brother
