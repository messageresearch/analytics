got me not here [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the the Vallejo and our sister for the internet and everyone watching us through the internet we uh you can open your scripture the book of Zechariah Chapter Four and we'll be reading from verse 6. it reads like this then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerebabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit said the Lord of hosts is great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it is moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel may have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts had sent me unto you las manos is for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth let us bow our heads in prayer Heavenly Father Celestia we're so grateful Lord this morning for your goodness and your love fathers that you show to us just ask that you speak Lord through your words just received Lord uh the great things that you have for them because you give great things we put ourselves in your hands we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and at the end of the service may all honor and glory be together we ask this in your precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated this morning I just wanna take a little bit of just take a thought we're still in the last days we're still in the book of Zechariah and you know our pastor and some of the brothers have been sharing in this book and I just want to uh just want to open it up and there in chapter four or something that really caught my attention you know it's when the angel uh he comes and uh and he he awakes us out of out of his sleep if I'm not mistaken that's who he who it is yes and and uh um you know and just kind of looking at this and uh just seeing how he was he was sleeping you know because he was living in a time you know where I believe that you know people had had gotten real comfortable you know they just they just get get comfortable and and then uh you know that's the Diego was saying on Friday you know he says uh being comfortable is is a pretty dangerous state to be here you know I don't believe that we were called to be in a state of comfort because you know when you're comfortable nothing gets done yeah nobody does anything you know when people are just relaxing but he's awakened out of his sleep and you know the Angel and the angels just declares a vision to him shows him a vision and uh you know he he lets them know you know that um this is uh this is something that that it was happening hey you know I just want to read again I want to start I want to start there in verse 7. where he says you know who art that old great mountains yes thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereofs crying Grace Grace unto it but you know it was the time where like I said they were just uh it was they were just relaxed you see the the foundation had been laid and you know it's it's great when we have uh when we see progress and fundamental foreign amen amen you see sometimes you know we start doing something and you know we get full of excitement but you know we don't go past the past what the first phase amen amen you know what the people they saw they saw these great mountains these are great obstacles you don't come in one way or another and uh and before you know it you know it just kind of smashed them they just it just smashed there the the their uh their hopes esperanzas and uh and you know they just can't everyone kind of stop stop doing work they stop doing their service you know they just uh they just just pretty much gave up for a while and you know it was it was I I believe it got to where it was a chaos you know and you know I think we're living in in a a very similar time you know I want to read a quote from brother Brandon oh maybe he says this in that quote let me uh it says he says this he says see you know just speaking about the time and the age that we're living in you know and uh you know just for a title before I get ahead of myself I want to title it conquering in chaos amen amen how many know what chaos is just it's yeah it's it's disorder that's that's all then you know and it brings confusion you know it brings us so many things into our lives you know when there is chaos you know we know that God is not there because God is not a god that is all disorders amen amen a god when when he speaks he he speaks into the chaos and he brings order or there amen amen and that's why we're here because you know we've gotten a little chaotic amen amen how many have been there you know what you just don't know what's going on so you don't know where you're going oh you don't even know if you're a Christian sometimes God speaks at him and he brings you back he brings us back you know that's that's the time that we're living you know a time of Chaos in a time of where you know the world doesn't know what's going on amen amen I'm gonna read this quote real quick it says I don't believe that a person just happened to be here by chance it says now just think it says when you come to the world everything had to be for prepared for you or pre-prepared this is for you it says I don't hardly understand how that how we that we could think that a God that could prepare all these good things for us would not we could not put trust in him they said it says that if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust him to prepare the things that is to come the Eternal things it seems I say very strange it says I believe that heaven is a real place that's a nice paragraph it says uh no I believe that heaven is a is a real place just the same as this is a real place that's the wrong quote this is for God started us in our spiritual growth in this place is and I believe that heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't sit up there for eternity and just sit there on a cloud it says we don't just strum our heart for all all from here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things and we're going to live it says we're going to work we're going to enjoy it says we're going to live we're going to life to a real eternal life we're going to a heaven a paradise but just like Adam and Eve foreign and that's why chaos exists for us to existence because there's going to be somebody there's going to be a son or daughter of God that is gonna come out and we'll be called conquerors I don't care what it is oh you will conquer stands in the midst of the chaos amen amen I believe it a 100 percent and I believe that when he's been he's speaking here who had laid the foundation he wakes them up out of sleep you know because I believe he had a colleague just like every one of us you see you you may have just begun foreign all right when we uh talk about a calling as Sarah Babel had a calling we have to understand that we were all not all called to do the same thing somewhere called the preach others were called the cuts others were called to to play instruments all of this record this thing we all have something different we do you know and even if you're not doing anything anything uh you know else I believe we were called to encourage one another question this kind of story comes to mind it was about it was about four brothers [Music] you know he runs and he calls friend he goes and he goes and gets help and then uh the other one you know he's over there he's a he trying to throw a stick to his brothers and then you know the dad comes you know and he saves the Sun and uh you know he he or calls it to her and he calls them all to accounts and he and he sits him down what'd you guys do when he fell in question one of them says well I ran to go get hell you know and then the other one the next all this is that well I just I just grabbed a branch and I tried to bring him in you know and then the youngest one he was just a little guy he couldn't do a whole lot but I I was motivating him and I can tell you this morning you know I think we're all in familiar paths here there's a lot of things that we haven't seen yet a lot of things we haven't done perhaps muchas and you know it's harder to do yeah when there's so much obstacles there's so much uh there's so much negativity I mean I could just imagine this man they had laid the foundation that's what the Bible you know and it just kind of just it just starts wearing you down it just it just it just wears on you come okay that's exactly what what happens to get wore out because you know it's if it's if it's not one thing it's another question if it's not the children it's the brothers and then you ask yourself why is this happening he wants to bring it out he wants to bring the best things but you may not know [Applause] [Music] wahoo before it actually started before I started my career Mi Carrera they actually uh read um a list of a lot of things that I took to be a lineman okay and uh they were they were pretty they was pretty rough yes you know I think that uh I think there should you know be a list because everybody has their list what it takes to be a real Christian I believe it oh we're not here we're gonna lie to people I'm not up here to lie to you and tell you but then it's gonna be it's gonna be nothing but roses oh you know I mean I'm not gonna tell you that I'm gonna tell you it's gonna be rough it's gonna be hard it's gonna be cold sometimes we are not here by foreign foreign because the list was rough these requirements weren't easy you required you to not be scared of heights it requires you to wake up in the middle of the night but when the conditions were below freezing uh when when the conditions oh we're very windy when there was tornadoes are you weren't gonna be able to run like everybody else you were gonna have to go and you were gonna and you and you had a calling and you had the answer to the call you know we all have a choice here you can answer to the calls or you can walk away you don't want the time by the time the the schooling was over One More Time by the time that the schooling was over um you know by the time we I had finished the school terminal Escuela there was only six left yeah says and uh of those things you know some of them tried it they got jobs but there's only five remaining but you know there was a lot of them were honest with themselves we try to talk them into it hey man it's gonna be okay and then one guy I remember he told me he said I can't do it man I like my sleep no he just he didn't he didn't want to wake up like man I'm not gonna go out there man I like sleeping that's just what he liked to do that's what he enjoyed he enjoyed that more you know then you know going into the into the work get into where it gets real tough into Christians sometimes you run into Christians and uh you know you you'll tell them what you believe I ran into us I ran into a sister one time and uh you know she was warning her husband yeah and uh she was like hey uh you better watch out man she was like those people they're not playing and I just kind of started laughing because she realizes she was playing church but that's what she said they're not playing man they're for real yeah you believe that it should be the same thing here he says glory to God Amen he says now out of this first key that we have receded of the Lord it's the one that says blackout it says okay there comes another and slightly less wonderful truth is I said I said that the true church would always try to be like it was in the book of Acts like that is exactly right we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there is complete blackout of Truth in the last days when the Lord is about to appear this is the question now arises in our minds does God forsake his own and let them follow into a state of complete deception the people that are called to live in this time of chaos foreign Una foreign oh you start getting tired but I knew you see when the phone was ringing that that's what I had signed up for okay that's what I signed up for my team and so I was willing to accept that because under those conditions that's what he's gonna do foreign amen it's uncomfortable I want to let you listen it won't always be that way what the Bible says that I was gonna be all right amen amen that's what he says that there are greater things ahead yeah foreign [Applause] it's one of those moments but you can't be afraid of heights Eagles they're not afraid to fly I'm not afraid I'm not afraid of the struggles foreign foreign I'm coming [Music] you let him know you're coming nobody said you had to stay quiet you may find yourself [Music] but God said he was gonna be with us when he was plucked out of the fire hey man amen he said that he was not he couldn't be consumed okay Satan could not consume him he could not be consumed foreign foreign [Music] he doesn't he doesn't know that desire anymore he killed it he killed it completely consumed it amen amen I'm closing now yesterday I gotta give myself some time come on when we talk about conquering in chaos I've come to realize one thing people are always uh speaking I've heard this you know so many times is no it's not fair it's not fair is it okay this person esta Persona you know lives like this and God still blesses him it's not fair that he gets away with doing wrong okay and nothing happens to him it sounds like asaph the musician it's a character he's like why is why is it that this Persona why is it that I serve in church yeah and I try my best intento mejor and then I look out there in the world and they have an abundance of riches they have an abundance of us so much and I'm barely I'm barely making it I'm barely hanging on Apen it's not fair you know I've I've come to understand I've come to understand here in this place that we were all called to do something it is I realized that life may not be fair but that doesn't mean that God isn't fair sometimes we gotta carry some weight we gotta carry weight that others won't carry you know there's times you know as strong as as I may look you know at night [Music] because it gets hurt you know I'm tore up inside I don't know what to do you know but one thing I've learned is that I can't depends I can't depend on what they tell me or how good they say that I am okay okay that's not gonna help me I can't depend on my wife foreign [Applause] but I'm hoping foreign [Music] foreign and I believe he'll do it because he said he would foreign amen amen
