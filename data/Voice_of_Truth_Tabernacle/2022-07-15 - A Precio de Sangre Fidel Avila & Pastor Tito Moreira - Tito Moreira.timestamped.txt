[51:37] the scripture says
[51:39] that he saw the blood captain understand

[58:26] salmo
[58:27] psalms 105.
[58:30] i'm sorry can i get here
[58:33] verse 23.
[58:40] psalms 105 23.
[59:01] israel also came into egypt and jacob's
[59:04] sergeant in the land of ham
[59:08] multiplicos
[59:12] and he increased his people greatly and
[59:14] made them stronger than their enemies
[59:16] cambio
[59:25] he turned their heart to hate his people
[59:27] to deal subtly with his servants embryo
[59:35] he sent moses his servant and aaron whom
[59:37] he had chosen
[59:45] they shoot his signs among them and
[59:47] wanders in the land of him
[59:55] he sent darkness and made it dark and
[59:57] they rebelled not against his word
[1:00:02] he turned their waters into blood and
[1:00:04] slew their fish
[1:00:10] their land brought forth frogs in
[1:00:11] abundance in the chambers of their kings
[1:00:18] terminus he spake and there came dive
[1:00:22] divers sorts of flies and lies in other
[1:00:25] coasts lesiogra
[1:00:30] he gave them hell for rain and a flaming
[1:00:32] fire in their land
[1:00:39] he smote their vines also and their fig
[1:00:41] trees and broke their trees of their
[1:00:42] coasts
[1:00:46] notice the destruction god brings
[1:00:50] notice how god is destroying
[1:01:22] people
[1:01:26] and they continue living a lavish life
[1:01:28] no no
[1:01:35] it hurt them so much
[1:01:54] you speak and the locusts came and
[1:01:56] caterpillars and that without numbers
[1:02:04] all herbs in their land and devour the
[1:02:06] fruit of their ground
[1:02:16] also the firstborn in their land the
[1:02:18] chief of all their strengths
[1:02:21] in other words he took away their
[1:02:23] strengths
[1:02:30] he brought them forth also with silver
[1:02:32] and gold and there was not one feeble
[1:02:34] person among their tribes
[1:02:36] egypt
[1:02:38] was glad
[1:02:40] when they departed
[1:02:46] when they departed
[1:03:21] for the fear of them fell upon them
[1:03:27] now we see egypt's story
[1:03:30] the story of exodus
[1:03:34] egypt is the type of the world
[1:03:39] and god allowed his people
[1:03:42] go
[1:03:55] because the bible says
[1:05:32] has
[1:05:48] i believe that's how the people of
[1:05:49] israel felt
[1:05:52] so they didn't see no points
[1:06:02] eternal
[1:06:28] it's very different to the freedom the
[1:06:30] devil offers in the world
[1:06:36] he mentioned when he's in prison
[1:06:40] i am so free in prison
[1:06:44] i'm
[1:06:45] you
[1:07:52] because until you realize how much of a
[1:07:54] slave you are
[1:07:58] so this nature that we have is
[1:08:01] dominating dumb nature we have esta
[1:08:04] naturales
[1:08:05] this dumb nature we have
[1:08:22] people live is
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:10:15] on the final tenth plague
[1:10:18] he says
[1:10:25] the angel of death will pass
[1:10:29] [Music]
[1:10:38] he's gonna hit them where it hurts the
[1:10:40] most
[1:10:42] but i want you to understand
[1:10:44] that's what the devil does
[1:10:47] that's what sin does
[1:10:49] i know god allows it
[1:10:52] but i want you to understand
[1:10:54] god
[1:10:55] is life
[1:11:52] because sometimes we need to
[1:11:53] if you always handle that they can see
[1:11:55] it with the picture and got it
[1:11:59] that at the end everything ends with
[1:12:01] death
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:20] and the devil takes everything you have
[1:12:22] alfinale at the end
[1:12:28] like albert fidel said after he makes
[1:12:30] you fall in love
[1:12:33] he only wants to destroy you completely
[1:12:45] and he says this will be the final
[1:12:46] plague
[1:13:02] because freedom
[1:14:30] one by one oh you know i don't believe
[1:14:32] it
[1:14:37] oh
[1:15:22] killed
[1:15:30] and fill their homes with blood and
[1:15:31] alcohol
[1:15:32] it was something horrible
[1:15:34] bonito it wasn't nothing
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:57] [Music]
[1:16:03] of the
[1:16:04] tabernacle you know the tabernacle
[1:16:10] was a place god provided in the
[1:16:11] wilderness
[1:16:17] you said that at the gate or entrance of
[1:16:20] the tabernacle
[1:16:23] in other words at the entrance of the
[1:16:24] church
[1:16:26] there was an altar
[1:16:28] there was an altar
[1:16:32] named the altar of sacrifice
[1:16:36] and at the entrance
[1:16:46] this place that was the most important
[1:16:48] for israel
[1:16:51] when you enter through the doors
[1:16:59] in a choir
[1:17:32] [Applause]
[1:19:04] his children
[1:19:18] watch
[1:19:24] el sacrificio the sacrifice
[1:19:30] era was substituted the substitute
[1:19:48] was their firstborn
[1:19:53] can anyone here say
[1:19:56] i was the one that had to die
[1:20:01] we don't deserve anything or to be here
[1:20:04] amen
[1:20:06] and god is showing them
[1:20:09] this is the price of your sins
[1:20:16] how terrible
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:21:10] that deserve to die
[1:23:10] the price was too high and painful
[1:23:17] brother branham says
[1:23:37] some 1900 years ago there was an old
[1:23:39] rugged cross going down through
[1:23:41] jerusalem dragging out the bloody
[1:23:43] footprints of the bearer
[1:23:45] enzo camino hacienda
[1:23:59] he couldn't go no farther
[1:24:14] and worship god
[1:24:19] it's because he paid the price
[1:24:26] if we can come
[1:24:43] someone paid the price
[1:24:46] because he paid the price
[1:24:55] he did not deserve
[1:25:40] but he gave himself
[1:25:42] he gave himself entirely
[1:25:45] the bible says
[1:25:47] when god gives him the instructions
[1:26:35] i'll meet more for himself
[1:26:37] he saw everything he did
[1:26:39] every one of them
[1:26:44] to enjoy
[1:26:48] true joy
[1:27:00] and he called me
[1:27:30] but i want
[1:27:58] he said i
