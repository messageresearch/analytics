[22:59] ROM Romans 8
[23:02] R Romans chapter
[23:07] 8 we'll read from verse
[23:10] 35 I'm glad to see
[23:14] everyone we're getting close to the end
[23:17] of the
[23:19] year and I think it's great time to
[23:25] testify I'm sure we had battles
[23:33] maybe some
[23:38] failures but above all the Lord has
[23:40] preserved us till
[23:42] now and it's good to speak of
[23:49] him people need to know and hear what he
[23:52] has
[23:55] done you and I can't help them
[23:58] but he can help
[24:00] them that's why we should speak to them
[24:03] about
[24:04] [Music]
[24:05] him we do not point to
[24:08] ourselves everything has been God God
[24:11] has been everything God has been
[24:13] everything
[24:16] amen I want to read verse
[24:20] 35 who shall separate us from the love
[24:23] of
[24:24] Christ tribulation distress
[24:30] pers nakedness Peril or
[24:34] sword as it is
[24:38] written for thy sake we are killed all
[24:40] the day
[24:42] long we are counted as sheep for the
[24:47] slaughter now in all these things we are
[24:49] more than
[24:52] conquerors through him that loved
[24:56] us for I'm that neither death nor life
[25:01] Angels
[25:03] principalities
[25:04] powers or things present nor things to
[25:08] come nor height
[25:12] nor nor any other
[25:16] creature shall be able to separate us
[25:18] from the love of
[25:21] God which is in Christ Jesus our
[25:26] lord and I want to read this quote from
[25:28] the
[25:30] prophet that says this about God's
[25:33] love and I'll let you have your
[25:38] seats this is the love of
[25:41] God no wonder the poet
[25:46] said would we with ink the ocean
[25:52] fill and were the Skies of parchment
[25:56] made
[25:59] and every stock on earth a
[26:13] quill and every man a scribe by trade to
[26:16] write the love of God above would drain
[26:18] the ocean
[26:23] dry nor could the scroll contain the
[26:26] whole
[26:29] though stretch from Sky to
[26:32] Sky that is God's love
[26:34] brother say that is God's
[26:38] love see the love of God says brother
[26:46] BR after man had fallen and deliberately
[26:49] opened the door to the
[26:51] enemy now put yourself
[26:55] here because we deliberately
[26:59] many times I've opened the door to the
[27:03] enemy and he come in and marred
[27:07] him set death in
[27:12] him still God was not willing to be
[27:16] defeated he came
[27:18] down and started all over
[27:22] again he was going to make that man
[27:26] again that is the love of
[27:29] God we should speak of what he has done
[27:33] let us pray Heavenly
[27:36] Father put ourselves in your hands
[27:39] Lord Lord as we hear some of these
[27:42] testimonies may they be of benefit and
[27:48] edification motive us to press on but
[27:51] above all
[27:53] Lord we want to glorify your
[27:56] name
[27:58] because you're the one that deserves all
[28:00] glory and
[28:01] honor you're the reason why we're still
[28:05] standing and everything we have is by
[28:07] your
[28:09] grace because we have more than what we
[28:14] deserve because you haven't paid us
[28:16] according to our
[28:18] sin nor to towards our
[28:23] iniquities you helped us Time After Time
[28:26] Lord
[28:29] and I believe it's worth it to speak
[28:31] about you like brother brandham
[28:35] said if they have accused me of one
[28:38] thing is to speak too much about
[28:43] him and brother B says we can never
[28:46] speak too much about him so
[28:49] Lord put these testimonies in your
[28:53] hands in the precious name of the Lord
[28:55] Jesus Christ amen amen
[28:59] May and our sister Sharon can
[29:09] begin God bless
[29:15] you this is one of many testimonies I
[29:21] have in
[29:26] 2012
[29:30] the enemy tried to derail me from the
[29:33] ways of the Lord that God had prepared
[29:35] for
[29:37] me and I began with a pain in my
[29:42] stomach my father took me to the
[29:50] hospital and they told me that my colon
[29:53] was
[29:56] inflamed
[30:14] so I felt my pain was at a level five
[30:16] and I told my father and they gave me
[30:18] treatment and they sent me
[30:23] home and as they went by I said you know
[30:26] what
[30:29] I couldn't eat
[30:32] anything everything I ate I would
[30:37] vomit and the pain continued to
[30:41] grow until a week went
[30:44] by and I told my
[30:49] father I feel like something swells in
[30:52] my
[30:55] stomach if you don't take me to the I
[30:57] don't think I'm going to make
[31:00] it my father took
[31:03] me I remember it was on a
[31:07] Saturday we lived close to my
[31:10] uncle and they took me to the
[31:13] ER I couldn't speak
[31:17] anymore because of the strong
[31:21] pain and they did an
[31:26] exam they did an
[31:30] ultrasound and they still couldn't find
[31:34] anything but the next
[31:38] day they found out that in the
[31:43] ultrasound my appendicitis was
[31:50] leaking and they transferred me to El
[31:54] Paso uh they put a catheter on me
[31:59] and then they returned me to the
[32:04] hospital and when they returned me to
[32:06] the hospital my skin was turning
[32:12] red because my stomach was about to
[32:15] explode on the
[32:19] inside so they called the doctor in the
[32:24] ER and on Monday
[32:28] I was in an emergency
[32:37] surgery because it had exploded and it
[32:39] was in affecting my areas inside me or
[32:43] ruptured inside
[32:46] me I was in a lot of
[32:54] pain and they did a bigger incision than
[32:56] normal
[32:59] more because they had to cut my
[33:01] intestine panc
[33:04] pancreas and my
[33:08] stomach I spent in the
[33:11] hospital almost a
[33:19] month for all of the damage of the
[33:22] appendicitis had done
[33:25] uh it was difficult when I
[33:28] had operations or
[33:30] surgeries
[33:40] um but I'm thankful with God despite
[33:42] going through all those
[33:45] problems God was always there for
[33:49] me my parents had to
[33:52] work and I had to stay in the
[33:55] hospital
[34:00] and it was a tough situation because
[34:01] there was no one there to help
[34:05] me use the restroom or get
[34:13] dressed but I give thanks to God because
[34:15] he's always been there when I need him
[34:17] the
[34:21] most and I know he'll always be there no
[34:23] matter what the enemy
[34:25] says
[34:28] I know he's always been my
[34:30] hero and that's why I love him more
[34:32] every
[34:35] [Applause]
[34:44] day God bless
[34:47] [Music]
[34:50] you I want to give my testimony how God
[34:52] has worked through me all these
[34:55] years
[35:01] I was always raised in a Christian
[35:06] household and for being rebellious I
[35:08] left
[35:14] church but before that I told the Lord
[35:17] give me permission I'm going to
[35:24] go but let me return well don't let me
[35:27] return with a broken limb or anything uh
[35:29] damaged from
[35:33] me and that's how he did it he returned
[35:36] me he returned me
[35:43] whole I'm praising the Lord now because
[35:46] all of these years the Lord has been
[35:47] with me
[35:51] now when I told the Lord I want to serve
[35:53] him
[35:55] better
[35:57] I told him to put me in a place where I
[35:59] could do my
[36:04] best he he gave me a dream and I could
[36:08] see where the Sun would
[36:12] rise Washington and I thought it was in
[36:16] another place I was in
[36:19] Washington and it wasn't there and my
[36:21] heart told me it wasn't
[36:23] there when I came to Colorado
[36:27] my heart told me it's in
[36:32] Colorado and God has been with me this
[36:34] far I came by
[36:37] faith we didn't have anywhere to
[36:41] stay but God had everything prepared for
[36:47] us brother Titus had an apartment ready
[36:49] for us and
[36:53] everything it wasn't just for us but it
[36:55] was for us in that time
[36:59] time we came only believing in the
[37:04] Lord and that's how the Lord has been
[37:06] dealing with
[37:09] me everything I've asked the Lord he has
[37:11] granted
[37:15] me I can't say God doesn't
[37:19] exist because God has been in every
[37:22] moment of my
[37:25] life every person God has put in my
[37:28] path is for a
[37:35] blessing and I'm very glad and thankful
[37:37] with the Lord for everything has given
[37:39] me in these years
[37:43] here this is the first part and I'll
[37:45] tell you the second part of my husband
[37:47] later God bless
[37:50] [Applause]
[37:55] you
[37:59] God bless you
[38:04] Brothers I'd like to share with you my
[38:10] [Music]
[38:12] experience how my sister said we were
[38:14] raising a Christian home all my life in
[38:16] this
[38:21] message my mother tells and I'd like to
[38:24] tell when I was born
[38:28] I was born with
[38:31] allergies a lot of spots on my body I
[38:34] was a very young
[38:37] girl all of my
[38:41] life it was always kind of shameful for
[38:47] me because I would go to sleep more and
[38:50] I would wake up with a rash on my face
[38:52] or a rash on my throat all of my body my
[38:56] head
[38:58] everywhere it was something
[39:00] impossible to
[39:03] overtake for me it was a tough
[39:08] burden I didn't understand why that
[39:10] happened to me or why
[39:17] me I remember always cried and asked God
[39:19] to heal
[39:20] me I didn't want to live that way no
[39:25] more
[39:27] my mother tried to treat me with
[39:29] anything took me to the
[39:33] doctor everything normal everything was
[39:38] normal one time in
[39:42] church I was 15 and the Pastor
[39:49] said raise your hand who wanted to be
[39:53] baptized who had the desire to be
[39:55] baptized and I
[39:57] did I did it with all my
[40:01] heart and I remember that day went to
[40:03] the
[40:08] river brother baptized
[40:11] [Music]
[40:12] me and as I was in the
[40:17] water I raised my hands and said
[40:21] Lord here I give you I give up my
[40:24] sickness I don't want it anymore
[40:27] I can't stand this
[40:29] anymore entire life all my
[40:34] life I couldn't withstand the pain
[40:39] the the shame that people would stare at
[40:44] me that
[40:47] day I raised my
[40:53] hands and I said deler you everything
[40:56] heal me I don't want this
[40:59] anymore and they took me to the waters I
[41:02] was
[41:07] baptized I remember when I stepped
[41:10] out I felt
[41:17] different and I not remembering about
[41:20] the rashes or the
[41:23] allergies because with the breeze
[41:28] when there was a fresh
[41:32] Breeze it would rash my
[41:35] [Music]
[41:37] skin or the dust I was very
[41:43] [Music]
[41:45] allergic I remember it was at
[41:50] night to go out late at night with
[41:52] [Music]
[41:55] the
[41:57] and we would get together at a coffee
[41:59] place and drink and
[42:02] talk I remember the wind was
[42:08] fresh and I didn't get any
[42:15] rashes and I said I can't see them
[42:18] because you could tell on my
[42:21] skin and I said I don't see them
[42:25] anymore
[42:26] and I said it left it's
[42:29] gone until this
[42:32] day I don't have that I don't have
[42:37] it so I tell you
[42:40] youth God does
[42:44] exist he can heal you from any
[42:48] sickness just have
[42:53] faith and this is one of many
[42:54] testimonies I have about my life
[42:57] life God bless
[43:00] [Applause]
[43:10] you God bless you Brothers good
[43:17] evening I'm here to first of all give
[43:20] thanks to everyone
[43:25] here
[43:26] my family and I have been congregating
[43:28] here alongside everyone since
[43:36] February you have been very loving and
[43:39] received us as brothers and I give you
[43:40] thanks and also thanks to the
[43:46] pastor I have in my heart to tell about
[43:49] two
[43:55] testimonies
[43:57] the first one is uh in April 2019 I was
[44:01] 36 years
[44:03] old and I had a
[44:12] stroke and this is something that was
[44:14] very unexpected for me because I had no
[44:16] risk
[44:23] factors I went to go uh warm up my car
[44:26] one morning and then all of my right
[44:28] side was foggy and I got
[44:35] drowsy and I went to go lay
[44:47] down and I was calling uh my work to
[44:50] call in and say I couldn't come in and
[44:51] they told me that it sounded like I was
[44:52] having a stroke that I should go to the
[44:54] hospital this was a
[45:03] three days later they did some exams in
[45:05] the hospital and they said I did have a
[45:07] stroke on my left
[45:23] side I had a pain
[45:29] um then I had a pton for Amo Valley in
[45:33] the Superior part of my
[45:45] heart and I went to the cardiologist and
[45:47] he told me I had no reason to suffer a
[45:54] stroke
[45:56] they told me it was higher probability
[45:58] to have a stroke giving birth to my
[46:01] daughters and thanks to God it wasn't
[46:04] that
[46:06] way so they corrected that
[46:16] issue and I'm thankful to the Lord
[46:18] because there was no uh damage left on
[46:20] me in my
[46:24] body I'm not sure why the Lord wanted to
[46:27] test me that
[46:36] way I I know the complications that
[46:39] patients can go after having a stroke
[46:41] but thanks to the Lord by his
[46:44] grace that was not my
[46:48] case so I thank the Lord for
[46:54] that
[47:00] my second testimony is in January 2021
[47:02] when I went to go do the second part of
[47:04] my uh nursing exam nursing program or
[47:08] nursing
[47:10] program
[47:20] um I had a lot of obstacles uh to cross
[47:23] due to a decision that I made
[47:34] I can tell you this because my faith has
[47:36] grown and it's elevated and I'm better
[47:38] spiritually
[47:42] now and this trial was that I trimmed my
[47:48] hair that was the last time I trimmed my
[47:54] hair
[47:56] and what happened after was
[48:02] undeniable because there were
[48:03] successions that happened that the Lord
[48:05] put in my
[48:13] path the first one was that my car was
[48:15] uh warming up outside to leave to
[48:20] work and some uh young people came and
[48:23] they stole my car
[48:31] but three or four days later I found my
[48:34] car without any
[48:46] damages and by this time I had already
[48:49] left my job and left all my benefits
[48:51] because I was going to begin the nursing
[48:53] program that was 5 minutes from my house
[49:02] and something else that happened that
[49:03] was uh like a tough
[49:09] punch is that I failed a Psychiatry
[49:18] class this for me before having a a
[49:22] stronger faith I couldn't even talk
[49:23] about
[49:24] this
[49:28] because a human ego is very
[49:33] [Music]
[49:39] weak because I had never felted a class
[49:41] I've passed every class in my life with
[49:43] A's and B's and this was the first time
[49:45] that failing a class hurt my
[49:54] ego
[49:56] and that was tough because humanly I was
[49:57] struggling I had a a tough
[50:10] anxiety before this I didn't have
[50:12] compassion for people that said they
[50:14] suffer with anxiety because I never had
[50:16] it so I say they can do something with
[50:19] to overcome their
[50:24] anxiety
[50:28] until you experience that in your own
[50:29] flesh then you can have compassion for
[50:31] the others because now you know how it
[50:43] feels the next thing that happened was
[50:45] that my daughter Mimi was seven years
[50:51] old and she fell and uh cut her waist
[51:00] and I took her to urgent care to get
[51:18] stitches this was very traumatizing for
[51:21] me because I took her to urgent care
[51:22] with an open wound and I could feel the
[51:25] I could see the W moving wound moving
[51:27] and I was just saying this was your
[51:36] [Music]
[51:48] fault the next thing that happened was
[51:50] through the course of three or four
[51:52] months we had a misunderstanding with my
[51:54] husband and we had some time that we
[51:56] were not even talking to each
[52:07] other it went on for about four months
[52:10] but uh that should not be the case
[52:12] because we live in a Christian home and
[52:13] we shouldn't um be fighting that
[52:21] way and none of us would intent to make
[52:29] peace I was living a
[52:33] hell I was living a hard
[52:43] anxiety I felt very ashamed I felt like
[52:46] I couldn't tell anyone or someone to
[52:48] support
[52:51] me so it was one of the worst moments of
[52:54] my life
[52:57] but now I can testify
[53:00] here that the lord gave me back
[53:10] everything to God my vehicle is a
[53:12] minimum but it's
[53:14] material but I recovered
[53:19] it my daughter is fine and it was only
[53:22] stitches she needed in her
[53:24] waist
[53:31] the Lord allowed me another opportunity
[53:32] to graduate and have a
[53:39] job but the most important and ways in
[53:41] my heart the
[53:46] most is that my faith could give a step
[53:54] forward
[53:57] because I've always been persistent in
[53:59] life and in professional
[54:02] things but that same gift of
[54:06] persistence I should be able to apply it
[54:08] to my
[54:19] faith I couldn't given this testimony if
[54:22] my faith would have not gotten stronger
[54:25] because I was
[54:30] embarrassed but now I can say I'm not
[54:32] embarrassed because I haven't trimed my
[54:33] hair since
[54:39] then the Devil is a devil and he brings
[54:41] us
[54:44] thoughts I've learned to tell him leave
[54:46] me
[54:48] alone and the Lord give me this
[54:52] Victory so thank you so much and God
[54:54] bless
[54:55] [Applause]
[55:03] you
[55:05] amen we give another clap offer to our
[55:08] Lord Jesus
[55:09] [Applause]
[55:14] Christ thanks to the Lord for the
[55:19] testimonies I believe when we testify
[55:21] about God our faith
[55:24] grows our faith
[55:27] grows and everyone else's Faith grows
[55:34] also because the small things and big
[55:37] things matter to God how many believe
[55:42] that God cares about small things and
[55:45] cares about big
[55:46] things so we
[55:51] Rejoice we can't wait to hear the second
[55:54] part of our sister Jenny's testimony
[55:58] am I thought she was going to say it but
[56:00] next
[56:06] time Glory God for
[56:11] that we thank the sisters that uh came
[56:15] forward God bless
[56:20] them I believe the men also have things
[56:23] to testify of
[56:27] it's just that sometimes the sisters are
[56:30] more
[56:31] Brave so may God bless them
