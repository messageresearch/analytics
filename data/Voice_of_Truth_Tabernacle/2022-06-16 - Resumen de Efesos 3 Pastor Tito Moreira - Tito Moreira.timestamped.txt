[21:54] galatians 1 15 says
[22:02] when it pleased god who separated me
[22:04] from my mother's womb and called me by
[22:06] his grace
[22:07] let us pray
[22:09] celestia heavenly father
[22:19] [Music]
[22:26] do you call it
[22:28] keep working in our lives lord gracias
[22:30] thank you lord
[22:32] yes
[22:35] because right now this is another
[22:36] another opportunity
[22:52] this evening
[22:56] that you would operate
[23:04] you would do as our soul is needing
[23:10] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[23:11] amen
[23:13] you may be seated
[23:18] we're speaking on paul
[23:20] he
[23:28] because he's the first messenger
[23:31] angel he's the first angel
[23:34] of
[23:48] i'll take advantage of this reviewing
[23:50] parable
[23:53] to speak on things i didn't speak on the
[23:54] first time
[23:57] always something more to speak always
[23:59] something more to search out uh aura
[24:01] pablo es el menzajo
[24:31] the church of the ephesians represents
[24:33] the fundamental defense represents the
[24:35] foundation of the faith
[24:38] say with me the church of ephesus
[24:40] represents represents
[24:43] the foundation of faith
[24:54] [Music]
[25:13] everything else depends on how strong
[25:16] you will not receive virtues
[25:18] if you don't have faith
[25:22] you won't receive knowledge
[25:23] if you don't have faith
[25:26] you won't receive temperaments
[25:28] if you don't have faith
[25:31] everything else requires faith
[25:35] so we want to speak on that uh
[25:37] brother branham
[25:46] a little bit about faith
[25:50] and how the faith
[25:53] ties in with love so
[26:23] la vida de pablo the life of paul nos
[26:25] habla acerca
[26:27] speaks to us of the man of faith
[26:32] pablo paul
[26:35] was a mantar
[26:50] it could face any
[27:30] he faced many things
[27:46] they left him as as dead
[27:52] i'll have the name in english
[27:56] that's where he was stoned
[27:59] and they left him as a dead man honey
[28:14] and he
[28:25] [Applause]
[28:38] and faces these are these
[28:39] men of witchcraft
[28:42] sorcerers
[29:02] a few times
[29:08] but it didn't matter to him he kept
[29:10] speaking about what god had given him no
[29:11] important french encounter of
[29:13] intellectuals he didn't care to face the
[29:15] intellectuals
[29:21] he would face the scholars
[29:37] many times
[29:45] [Music]
[29:48] he survived a a great multitude of
[29:51] people that come up against him equando
[30:06] the roman governors reyes judeos jewish
[30:10] kings
[30:12] not once did he ever back off
[30:17] paul never backed off
[30:34] dead
[30:36] many times at the point of death
[30:41] people terrorized around him
[30:45] but he had that
[30:47] perfect desire
[31:03] the building is is founded on
[31:06] perfect but the brand says in perfect
[31:08] faith
[31:12] and so when a man lives by faith and
[31:14] walks by faith
[32:40] to them with this perfect face
[32:48] so is it now with those who have perfect
[32:50] faith are a mystic to others
[32:54] we
[33:21] but what the spirit says
[33:47] now this phrase is given to the seven
[33:49] church ages
[34:18] he goes right on just
[34:59] and that's by faith
[35:28] when
[36:15] [Applause]
[37:20] here anything else
[37:29] hold on now
[37:33] pablo paul
[38:14] and called me by his grace
[38:29] the perfect faith is based on something
[38:34] perfect what is a perfect faith based on
[38:36] establish
[38:38] based on the grace of god
[38:56] you have to go through the three steps
[38:57] of of grace three stages of grace
[39:02] many times
[39:05] you go to justification
[39:10] and then the new birth
[39:12] is
[40:07] do you want to have this type of faith
[40:09] brothers
[40:11] you want to make sure you have it
[40:15] here
[40:17] perfect faith is basis
[40:22] but grace
[40:30] and you had he quickened who were dead
[40:32] in trespasses and sins
[40:47] he considered himself the worst of
[40:49] sinners
[41:14] [Applause]
[41:18] oh
[41:32] the lord jesus christ
[42:02] than a prostitute
[42:13] and the people
[42:26] about what he had done
[42:42] on hundreds or thousands
[42:45] the declaration
[42:46] of
[42:47] a decree to kill
[42:51] against the children of god
[42:53] the bible says
[43:37] how many how many killings did he or
[43:39] judgments he didn't have upon him
[43:44] of god
[43:47] because of what he had done
[43:50] when paul speaks these words
[45:16] together
[45:25] [Applause]
[45:44] [Applause]
[45:57] this is so fundamentally
[46:28] perfect you won't have the perfect faith
[46:34] this element brandon brother branham
[46:36] says
[46:55] notice
[46:56] now another perfect faith
[46:59] paragraph 49
[47:00] sit there notice now another perfect
[47:02] faith is the master of all circumstances
[47:04] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[47:22] you
[48:32] you won't have perfect
[49:42] listen to me grace
[50:22] foreign
[50:27] [Applause]
[50:38] throughout everything
[50:52] you understand
[51:03] loved by god
[51:20] because he understood the grace
[51:26] do you see him on brandon brother
[51:28] branham says
[51:30] for example like uh
[53:38] is
[54:34] genuine love will create a confidence in
[54:36] his word
[55:04] that time in her testimony
[55:10] i'm not what i wanted
[55:12] to say that i'm not what i used to be
[55:14] hey yes
[55:16] she knows she'll come somewhere
[55:52] gives me confidence in him
[56:20] he's got a purpose in doing it
[56:25] he's seen something in me
[56:52] he saw something in me
[57:00] is helviol with me and if you saw
[57:02] something in me
[57:10] it doesn't matter if nobody else sees it
[57:15] it doesn't matter if i don't see it
[57:18] see alviol with me if he saw something
[57:20] in me
[57:22] god's not something in you
[58:06] he could have took
[58:19] no one can do it
[58:40] that creates faith
[59:01] you'll never have faith
[59:16] when he pushed
[59:25] [Applause]
[59:43] he knows what he's doing
[1:00:40] your
[1:02:04] you
[1:02:15] lord
[1:02:31] divine love towards others
[1:03:02] i'll see if god touches them
