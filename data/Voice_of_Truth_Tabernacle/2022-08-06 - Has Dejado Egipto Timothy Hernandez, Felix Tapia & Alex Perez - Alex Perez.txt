[Music] yes guys [Music] foreign [Applause] you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then shall then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine one more scripture in the book of Exodus verse 1 and 2. and God spake all these words saying I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage we thank you for one more opportunity one more opportunity to surrender ourselves to you and give you more of us as you would be with my lips there would be a blessing to your people put all this in your hands and Savior Jesus Christo we have placed it have you left egyptus Viejas have you left your old ways have you left your old thoughts amen have you left the world or if I could ask you or do you still can uh are you still in bondage because we could have it all but we continue being uh being slaves the people of of Egypt the people of Israel after they had broughten them out of of the Red Sea they had a slave mentality they had a slave mentality it's like being being in a cage where somebody tells you you have it all but you don't you don't get out of here the definition of a slave is it's one who lacks their own freedom and rights because they are absolutely subject to the will and control of another person who was their owner who can buy or sell them as if they were merchandise number two is the person who is dominated by a passion or by a vice that he needs to live or to feel good Israel the people of Israel says in other words it's a great story where the Lord brings the people out of Egypt facing and defeating Pharaoh offices offering a wave Escape through the blood of the land brings out his people and takes them through the through the waters of the Seas into the desert where they would they were complaining and murmuring vemos que dios we see that God he shows his mighty hands he shows what he is what he is capable of doing how many this evening trust in God because I believe if the people of Israel would have trusted in God yes and accepted his grace what would have happened what happened it wouldn't have happened amen all right man the next one is Exodus 19 Verse 6 says and he shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel says and Moses came and called for all the Elders of the people respond and then late before they face all these words and the people answered all that the Lord had spoken we will do Pueblo and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Moses although I come unto thee in a thick Cloud that the people may hear when I speak with them and believe thee forever and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord now God is brings the people of Israel he shows him he shows he's manifested in a thick cloud and we see here it's very important because just like the Lord was in that cloud foreign [Music] but like I had I said they left them at the slaves amen in Exodus 32 of verse 1. and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mountain the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt we want not what has become of him brother Branham tells us that Moses it was the type of Christ we have our own ideas and we have our own idols amen how is it that is the people of Israel yeah there's even a thing is yours and and God giving them everything even then they they decided to put God they put the Lord who had taken them out of Egypt they set him aside we want nothing to do with you they are contrary they win they made their Idols they said let us live as we lived previously let us live like we lived so that's when they made their Idols if I could put it in a spiritual form the Lord wants muchas he has taken us out of many things at one point we thought we weren't going to come out says as a dog returning to his vomit so will fool return it to his folly as the dog returning to his vomites amen amen sometimes we leave the things but even but but yet we have not left them completely if the people of Israel I could have simply trusted in him if the Voice of Truth Tabernacles could just trust in God [Music] so then we don't allow God to do what he wants to do with us amen amen I know many of us don't want to dwell in dry lands amen amen Glory in the message the Lord keeps all his appointments and just like Israel is when they were shouting the victory at the bank of Jordan yes they were within a four days Germany oh from the promised land is they didn't realize that they were going to take 40 years why was it the grace had provided a prophet for them a lamb of sacrifice a Deliverance but yet they wanted Allah they wanted to be able to do something they wanted to put their hands in it this was the the greatest error that they had committed in Exodus 19 where they rejected Grace and accepted the law and then what did they do he allowed them to stay in the desert for 40 years and they had children there and and for 40 years that's that's where they were God is in our midst Brothers in US amen see if I could put it this way Nosotros are the ones that don't allow God to work in us we don't allow God to move this is because of our old mentality it doesn't allow us to take us that doesn't allow us to advance it leaves us God wants to take us the Lord wanted to take the other people to a Promised Land we are the problem our old mentality amen I am the Lord your God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage that's right amen in the message foreign I am grateful this evening with our Lord God that was at one time on Mount Sinai sorry because I have it in English that one stood on the mount and taught the Beatitudes and raised from the dead is in our midst tonight and taught the beauty and raised from the dead is in our midst tonight and it's the same yes he was then yesterday and he foreign and to think that he is the god of Heaven would humiliate himself to come down and associate with such as myself and us here poor people not much of this world's goods and just illiterate and yet he loved me so you know he came down and saved me by his grace nothing I deserve or could not do but he saved me because before the foundation of the world he predestinated me to be safe own foreign [Music] amen thank you God bless you if you can please turn your page to Exodus chapter 16 verse 2. I'll leave it all the eggs I'd like to thank God and the trust for the people put in me um and the whole Congregation of the children of of Israel murmured against Moses may God have blessings to his word I'm going to continue talking about Moses and the children after they they crossed the Red Sea cuando and they began to murmur when they started walking in the wilderness in the wilderness they began to murmur against God and Moses because it was just a dry desert there and they thought you brought us out of out here to die yes and they they they they had thirsts then they had nothing to drink that's what it says in the Bible brother Branham says they begin to complain you took us out of Egypt to stay here and die in the desert you know over there and in Egypt and egito they had a lot of things they had fruit they they they they they had grapes you know they had all kinds of things and there in the desert they found themselves with nothing absolutely and that's why they were complaining you know Pharaoh had just doubled their their tally you know and and they they had more things but Moses was already unified with God and he could see the Promise something that the children of Israel couldn't see I go que Pueblo de Israel because they were still insane even though they were free at that point is punto they wanted to go back and they wanted to be slaves again even though they just had seen the miracle of God of the Red Sea just opening them and they're able to walk through it you know they still wanted to go back to Egypt you know because they had everything there you know Egypt is the type of the world I want to share this quote it's in a message a total Deliverance is okay okay I have it in English bro yeah okay this is that's the way uh Moses and his group did they got over there and got under the blood you notice until they got under the blood there was no total Deliverance Moses himself he was unified with God but Israel wasn't there still was sin and they murmured against Moses and they said why why do you do this you bring more trouble upon us because Pharaoh just doubled their tally of Brixton and so forth that was Moses he was completely in the hands of God totally delivered from the from sheep herding to herd God's sheep he was totally delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because there there was still murmuring among them they were still complaining even though God delivered them they wanted to go back you know because they couldn't see nothing you know they were just in a dry desert you know there's no water for them to drink and they thirst yeah they want they they wanted to go back and be slaves instead of being having freedom and see and just like today you know we are fortunate to live in a country where there is freedom estamos have been decisions you know but brother Branham says we're a million miles away from being free um the enemy makes us think that we're free he uses that to deceive us he said you have the freedom you want this is and you could do whatever you want here in this place in this free country you have the freedom to have whatever you want come on and that's how he gets in our mind when we make mistakes he says you can't fix it just stay in the world go back to the world you have everything you have there you can have everything you want you're gonna have money you're gonna have drugs you can have whatever you want it is all yours you know it's not worth it being Christiano that's what the devil tells us it's not worth it being a Christian there you don't have all what you have here you you're just there in a dry place you don't have nothing there no tiene is and out here you can have whatever you want yeah and he gets in our minds and he says it is not worth it and just like the children of Israel God is doing great things here at church he's doing he's changing people's lives you know he's doing Miracles here you know he is doing wonderful things you know but there's things they but that the devil doesn't want us to see those things he tells you it's more comfortable to live in the world you know you have it all there [Music] my my he says you are comfortable out there why go to church why Surrender Your Life to God but God wants to take us out of the worldly thing but sometimes we just want to stay there we're closed off we refuse to accept what God is doing is what he wants to do with us he wants to do wonders he wants to do Miracles he wants us to help him change lives he wants us to go and find Souls three there's no salvation for this world you know but there is a lot of Salvation and souls out there are still souls he wants something greater for you he doesn't want it to stop here there's still a long road amen I think it's time that we let go of these things of the world [Music] you know I was thinking the other day you know I need to stop and let go of things and bring other people for my problems um and say and take responsibility for my own problems that it is you know but it is my fault that God cannot do certain things in my life you know that's what we need to do we need to quit blaming the people around us say God it is just me and you he is South we ride brother that's right we need to take God's promises even though we're in the desert and we can't see nothing we just see dried dirt and rods you know we don't see water novemosawa but we need to unite ourselves with God like Moses was United with God even though they couldn't see nothing on chaos even though the Israelite children couldn't see nothing but Moses could see the promises of God you know that's what we need to do look at the promises that God gave us and there is nothing that can take it away from us you know we were meant to be slaves we were meant to be slazier in this earth God made us different it made you unique he made you special even though you don't see it in you know classes your name is foreign [Music] places straight I will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in Sunder the bars of iron is and I will give the the treasures of darkness in Hidden Riches of secret places that thou mayest know that I the Lord which called thee by thy name and the god of Israel Escondidos the same God that took the children of Israel out of Egypt which is the type of the world it is the same God that can take us out of the world he is the same God that can restore us he is the same God that could make something different you can say brother there is no way I can change there is no way you can change me there's no good there's no hope for me and you know just like a cricket stick yes you know you can't straighten it out but you know what cricket teams draw straight lines you know you could straighten out yourself you just have to let God in who's the God come into my life he is here tonight he can restore you even though you may not see anything you know God is here to do Miracles God is here to give you a new story brother Branham and the message Unity of one guard in the in the one Church um you can live here and you can't leave here tonight with riches that no money could ever buy is you can unite your heart with Christ Jesus Jesus he can come into your soul and take the control room no matter what comes and goes you'll be in a you'll be happy the rest of your days [Music] you know things of the world they come and go they waste those things that you're a slave too you know your jobs your cars they all run out but God never runs out God never runs out and how are you going to leave tonight are you going to leave a slave or are you going to leave someone that's United with God just like Moses was he was United with God you have the opportunity here tonight even if it's just you uh even if you have probably never come out to the altar uh you know it could be you buddy you know you can just ask God I don't want to be a slave no more I don't want to be a slave to this world I want to get out of Egypt and I want to start something new with you guys we're going to have a new relationship man God bless you amen glory to God amen I'm gonna ask you to stand um you can stretch a little bit amen numerous Numbers chapter 11 verse four amen how many are happy for what the Lord has already given us amen so good with us Numbers chapter 11 verse 4 says like this La Quinte extra questions and the mixed multitude that was among them felt a lusting and the children of Israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat de los pepinos de los Melones Los pueros Los Angeles we remember the fish we did eat in Egypt freely the Cucumbers the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic bread but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all beside this manner before our eyes God chose Israel I like something that brother Eric said this is that God chose the people of Israel honors his word [Applause] he wanted him to be an example to the rest of the Nations God had made a covenant with Abraham idiots and God brought the people of Israel okay and the reason that God has so much patience with us because he loves us he has chosen Foundation what you're able to do I hope you believe it tonight God chooses the people of Israel he loves the people of Israel God takes the people out from Egypt through a prophet but the mentality of these people as our brothers have said the most difficult is to leave our old mentality God always wants to bless but as our brothers say that I've spoken nosotroses it's no longer God but it's oneself that keeps God's blessings away it was difficult to leave the old mentality that mentality of leaving your your comfort zone you know with you there's another error that these people made when they left the Bible says in Ecclesiastes he says what is the cause of the former days we're better than these in other words do you know why because in US returning we're returning not only to the mentality for 430 years they didn't know anything but Egypt is that right young men and young ladies have eggs they were born many of them in Egypt they grew up around idols so many facts they grew up with oh I like the way this this young man he lets his hair grow I like how Pharaoh lets his beard grow out you are special waiting for the Deliverance the world keep walking I die there you have to advance foreign where there is no vision El Pueblo the people perish when I think of Israel and I I I think on why they never understood what God wanted me to do with them look God loved them brothers and God loves us perhaps it's wrong in my way of thinking but I believe that if Israel the Commandments of God there would have been the most tremendous people on the face of the Earth now our election it doesn't determine and I believe that we are or what God has told us God has to send his law the law s the law when God gives it to the people of Israel for them to understand look because with our law there is no order without a law there's no orders give them his word his law so like they could understand that they're different and maintenance they maintain the order of this church is that correct the law brings structure Brothers they are a person that is is the word of God reminds me of my position then I would be a reckless person but the word of God my position in Christ foreign foreign [Music] there's a manual for my life [Music] if they would have understood that what God wanted to do and God had to send a man Moses to give them their word when you think of Moses you always think of the law the law was not bad did you know that even is healthy you'd be skinny foreign nombre right that's sometimes when we think about we think of a man that was that was so tremendous you know he was a man like you and I said the only thing that was different from Moses is that he believed God and he grabbed a hold of the promises that's all that you and I have to do it's that simple estan simply get a hold of his words foreign on Moses I want to say this is the musicians come forward when Moses began he was a he was a rebellious man an angry man just as many of us right Egyptian s but along his journey he began to change because the trials Brothers [Music] if you can see it the correct way if you visualize this is gonna help me of the people of Israel and God wanted to kill them he wanted to exterminate finish them off you know what they're so hard we're so rebellious because everything is changing are better than the times you have now let's never say that both of those beginners Moses came to the point in his life history [Music] that was rebellious that was angry he began he got to be a man like me humble [Music] Amoroso loving is willing to give his life do it don't destroy them [Music] God help us [Music] help us for the better [Music] that our mentality change that our focus is the word of God not as a book of laws as you benefit for your benefit do you see how things change is he wants me to be different that's what God wants worship Him thank you [Music] necesito [Music] I want to be better [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause]
