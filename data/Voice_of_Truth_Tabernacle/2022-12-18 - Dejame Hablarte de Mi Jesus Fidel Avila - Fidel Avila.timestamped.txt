[28:51] brother
[28:52] Lord

[30:33] at this moment
[30:38] and even members from church
[30:42] are more focused
[30:45] on the things that happen in the world
[30:49] but I do not blame them
[30:53] that's as far as a person concerns
[30:57] you cannot blame people
[31:00] because that's as far as they can see
[31:03] they can't see further
[31:06] we will be speaking today
[31:08] my subject this morning
[31:11] I titled it in English because I I love
[31:14] it more let me tell you about Jesus
[31:18] Jesus

[32:28] we're only celebrating
[32:45] put this on my nose but what is a myth
[32:49] and
[32:50] imaginary story lives

[34:56] come on how did he make me Rich
[35:00] you might not have a lot of money
[35:07] he made you rich
[35:13] one of his purposes
[35:20] one of the purposes he came to Earth
[35:24] was to understand us
[35:38] experience it
[35:40] is
[35:41] by himself in himself the pain the
[35:46] poverty
[35:48] he couldn't understand you
[35:51] had to come down
[35:54] and came in the form of a child
[36:23] he could have snot come out
[36:26] right
[36:28] people can't understand
[36:33] themselves
[36:35] he came with a purpose

[36:58] he did it for his love
[37:04] it's for you
[37:10] it's for you
[37:12] foreign
[37:15] he did it for me
[37:24] he being rich became poor
[37:28] having everything
[37:30] lacking nothing
[37:33] he left his throne
[37:41] Isaiah says
[37:48] he's the spies
[38:01] come with all of this in him
[38:05] how is it possible for a child
[38:08] born in a manger
[38:11] came with this inside of him

[47:08] that child is
[47:11] that was one of the purposes
[47:15] so that we could get close

[49:31] I wish he was on Earth
[49:40] you can understand your purpose on this
[49:43] Earth
[49:53] brother pranam says
[49:55] now watch Hebrews 3 1.
[50:00] the Bible says that he is the high
[50:02] priest of our confession is that correct
[50:06] now that's Professor yes
[50:19] he can do a thing for us until we accept
[50:22] it is
[50:54] amen
[50:59] God has healed me God has delivered me
[51:03] of something
[51:05] I believe there are witnesses here
[51:12] hello
[51:23] is that right he can do a thing
[51:27] no matter what it is
[51:31] you've got to accept it by faith first
[51:34] that's where it is
[51:37] you want to be delivered there's the key
[51:40] accepted by faith
[51:46] it will manifest
[51:49] o
[51:52] and believe it and
[52:03] confesses
[52:10] correct intercessions is that right
[52:19] [Music]
[52:47] the most intimate place
[52:49] I guarantee you that he will understand
[52:54] you
[52:56] because his word is true
[53:02] this is
[53:04] he sympathizes with our sickness
[53:10] as far as I know that it's the truth how
[53:14] many believe the angel of the Lord
[53:16] how many believe the angels
[53:20] we should take this
[53:24] the Second Step
[53:27] forgive me the first point was to
[53:29] understand this
[53:31] I can spend a lot of time but I want to
[53:34] finish
[53:35] the second point was to save us to
[53:40] rescue us
[53:55] we can be in church and loss that's the
[53:59] truth
[54:01] was in the same church that Jesus was
[54:04] and he was lost
[54:10] he came to rescue us
[54:14] because we didn't have access
[54:16] that privilege because it's a privilege
[54:26] to come into His presence
[55:06] just because it pleased him
[56:05] my God
[56:07] is real foreign
[56:29] he is here
[56:34] this is
[56:39] below
[56:51] Rejoice greatly shout he said
[56:55] it says shout out daughter of Jerusalem
[56:58] let's bring it here to us
[57:03] let's sing of Jubilee
[57:07] because a child was sent to us
[57:13] that you and I would have access
[57:20] Behold thy King cometh on City
[57:23] Salvador he is just and having salvation
[57:28] and riding upon an ass sovereign
[58:19] see him
[58:21] oh wait a minute oh brother
[58:25] people are going crazy for what's
[58:27] happening in the world but let me tell
[58:30] you
[58:31] there's nothing better than our Jesus
[58:34] there's nothing better than our Jesus
[58:38] you think soccer
[58:40] is going to take away your illness
[58:43] you think Santa Claus
[58:47] Santa Claus you think Santa Claus
[58:50] will take your sorrow
[58:52] depression
[58:54] all the demons
[58:56] you think Santa's gonna take that from
[58:59] you no sir
[59:04] something that they exaggerated
[59:06] but my Jesus is real
[59:10] and you are sure
[59:15] because you have experience
[59:20] no experience in your life
[59:24] he rescued us brethren
[59:30] they say
[59:33] um
[59:36] and the message Redeemer Redemption what
[59:39] did he redeem is
[59:46] my soul and your soul from hell
[59:52] aren't you glad for that
[59:56] because we were on our way there
[1:00:05] maybe you were on your way straight to
[1:00:07] heaven but I was
[1:00:10] you'll see I was
[1:00:13] I was poor brethren
[1:00:15] economics
[1:00:17] economically also poor I remember when I
[1:00:21] was a child
[1:00:25] and my grandmother buys
[1:00:28] cereals with my brothers
[1:00:33] we'd get a super small portion of
[1:00:36] something a small cornflakes
[1:00:40] we would spread them out I remember
[1:00:58] sometimes that's how God's grace is
[1:01:01] we have so much of him
[1:01:04] that of his grace we make a disgrace
[1:01:09] that we think God will forgive us
[1:01:11] we think he will be there for us all the
[1:01:14] time
[1:01:15] that's a lie of the devil
[1:01:37] because God's grace is still upon you
[1:01:42] this is
[1:01:47] brought back everything Adam lost
[1:01:50] what did Adam lose
[1:01:52] what did Adam lose
[1:02:01] one of the things was love
[1:02:10] Adam lost a lot cuando hello
[1:02:17] when he put you in a pawn shop
[1:02:20] he changed us
[1:02:22] he changed everything
[1:02:26] and he put us in a pawn shop
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ
[1:02:34] was his King his Redeemer
[1:02:37] who redeemed
[1:02:39] Every curse of the devil and this
[1:02:43] morning
[1:03:01] God redeemed you
[1:03:14] ready he redeems your soul
[1:03:18] he redeems your body your sick body
[1:03:26] how many are sick this morning
[1:03:30] a lot of sick people
[1:03:34] forgive me
[1:03:39] he redeemed his soul
[1:03:44] he redeems the sad and angry spirit
[1:03:50] maybe you don't have a need um
[1:03:54] maybe by God's grace you have everything
[1:03:56] you have a home a vehicle
[1:04:00] let me ask you
[1:04:02] what about spiritually
[1:04:26] there's time for everything
[1:04:32] but when we put something first before
[1:04:34] God there's the mistake
[1:05:20] what was the purpose
[1:05:24] if God took a filthy vessel olympio and
[1:05:29] washed it
[1:05:31] and is he just gonna store it
[1:05:40] I
[1:05:53] was even a thief
[1:05:57] but those glasses were very pretty there
[1:06:01] that's fine they look nice
