momento yes oh my you [Music] [Music] [Music] song [Music] [Music] true [Music] fully tried and true be one more time lord prepare me to be to be me [Music] with thanksgiving [Music] oh sanctuary for you amigo [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] r m [Music] the [Applause] [Music] god bless you um we're going to open our scripture um the book of ephesians chapter six versions let's read the word it says like this at least i see it says finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might just put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil diablo we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen uh you may be seated uh for a title brother uh fidel and i and uh you know it we leave it as a question uh you know i was uh just kind of thinking that we're still talking about the the temple being built and uh you know how the foundation had been laid and uh we know the foundation of all things is is the faith and you know i was just kind of studying and uh just kind of thinking on certain things oh you know uh the devil el diablo he's not really gonna bother you he's not really gonna gonna hinder you in any kind of way unless you claim you know you claim to believe in god's words and you know and you know they they think that you know it's it's more of like a picnic if piensan quest [Music] you got to get past those things because i believe oh that this is the battleground this is this is life or death you know and that's that's what i believe you know let's just read against the rulers of the darkness on a higher level to live a higher kind of life and when we come here you see and and there's uh you might have a little a disagreement with your brother [Music] it i don't want to be the devil's entertainment amen amen now when we when we sit there and we we talk about the spiritual warfare i want to read something brother branham says in one of his messages i think it's uh god revealing himself in simplicity and brother branham says this is he says it's a warfare estonia because the greatest warfare is going on is a spiritual warframe since now when god know this was going to come to pass [Music] just like the united states does for their army welcome we give a man a helmet to wear because we know he's going to use it we give him a spade to dig in oh we know it's a big it's about a 90-pound pack on his back [Music] but the army knows they've got to train him for that because he's going to need friends we gotta take the whole word of god because we're going to need it we've got to use every word that's in there not only [Music] but it goes as [Music] that's what he was attacking he was not attacking the man he was a turkey oh what the man said he believed he actually declared i want you to understand is coming of this when the devil sees something is coming that's when he begins to work because that's when he brought he brought the oppression that's when he tried to push [Applause] [Music] and that's when the fight actually begins when your faith is declared but if you don't have any faith instead not the nfa all those things can't be revealed to you the read the bible i go to church finally i want you to understand a man sharpened at the countenance of his friend [Applause] hey man a man you see when iron sharpens iron but there has to be a form of contact you see and then [Music] you say there what happens is that uh they cannot sharpen themselves and then they pick and and then there's that it's it's they're dull and stands in filo and god can't use something that's right i see yes you see the bible says that the word is sharper than a double-edged sword and what he's actually wanting to do it and seek it because he wants to sharpen you up you watch the sharper you walk he wants you to become an instrument instrumental a sharp principle instrument that can is word but in the person and a persona because there's no weakness in god's word i believe your creole got the word of god it's all power estonia it's all powers he you know just kind of talking about um the the power hey avlando solo sovereign you know uh the devil interrupts el diablo he tries to interrupt god's plan it says and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea and so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep matthew 8 it's in there it says it says but he was asleep and then it says this and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish in your salvation and he says unto them why are you fearful oh ye of little faith you see i want you to know this but the bible says we're moving is amen amen well i'll just leave the place for brother fidel fidel god bless you [Applause] is [Applause] then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by mine nor by power but by thy spirit say the lord of hosts for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would the scripture i want you to understand i need to analyze i think the majority of times in picnic we're in a picnic we're in the playground if you notice the [Music] god's word is a sword but we use this sword in the wrong way use that sort of wound our brother that's sword my children anyone a minimum a man brother la palabra the word says brothers that's what that's how we do that we're is we're evil and we take refuge [Music] [Applause] god for forgiveness that's not important brethren were not meant to stay halfway we were made to finish the work we weren't made to be cheap christians we weren't made for that oh somos we either are oh no more we aren't we were made to overcome hermano you were amazed [Music] you're not i want you to understand the word of god is not only a sword it is a sword is a weapon it's a strategy captain my [Applause] yes and this is how i see it how will you win the war 365 days is your heart the people's defects criticize because you criticize all the time or you 365 days you he's already sold himself brother and the sister is not even in the account diablo the devil beats you megan beats me [Music] [Music] but god because it will make you a better christian or you'll become more unbeliever than what you are i'm not sure who you're living with [Music]
