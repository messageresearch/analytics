[24:20] the
[24:35] the Vallejo and our sister
[24:39] for the internet and everyone watching
[24:41] us through the internet we uh
[24:44] you can open your scripture
[24:49] the book of Zechariah
[24:52] Chapter Four
[24:56] and we'll be reading from verse 6.
[25:01] it reads
[25:03] like this
[25:06] then he answered and spake unto me
[25:08] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[25:12] zerebabel saying not by might nor by
[25:15] power but by my spirit said the Lord of
[25:18] hosts
[25:20] is
[25:29] great Mountain
[25:31] before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a
[25:34] plane and he shall bring forth The
[25:35] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[25:38] Grace Grace unto it is
[25:50] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[25:53] me saying
[25:55] the hands of zerubbabel may have laid
[25:58] the foundation of this house
[26:00] his hands shall also finish it and thou
[26:03] shalt know that the Lord of hosts had
[26:05] sent me unto you las manos is
[26:15] for who hath despised the day of small
[26:17] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[26:20] see the plummet in the hand of
[26:22] zerubbabel with those seven they are the
[26:26] eyes of the Lord which run to and fro
[26:28] through the whole earth
[26:39] let us bow our heads in prayer
[26:44] Heavenly Father Celestia we're so
[26:46] grateful Lord
[26:48] this morning
[26:49] for your goodness and your love
[26:53] fathers that you show to us
[26:57] just ask that you speak Lord through
[26:59] your words
[27:21] just received Lord uh the great things
[27:24] that you have for them
[27:27] because you give great things
[27:34] we put ourselves in your hands
[27:37] we ask this in the name of the Lord
[27:39] Jesus Christ
[27:40] and at the end of the service
[27:43] may all honor and glory be together
[27:46] we ask this in your precious name
[27:50] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[27:53] amen amen you may be seated
[27:57] this morning I just wanna take a little
[28:01] bit of just take a thought
[28:05] we're still in the last days
[28:08] we're still in the book of Zechariah
[28:13] and you know our pastor and some of the
[28:16] brothers have been sharing in this book
[28:21] and I just want to uh just want to open
[28:23] it up and there in chapter four or
[28:26] something that really caught my
[28:27] attention
[28:30] you know it's when the angel uh he comes
[28:35] and uh and he he awakes us out of out of
[28:39] his sleep
[28:42] if I'm not mistaken that's who he who it
[28:45] is
[28:46] yes and and uh
[28:50] um you know and just kind of looking at
[28:52] this
[28:53] and uh just seeing how he was he was
[28:56] sleeping
[28:58] you know because he was living in a time
[29:02] you know where I believe that you know
[29:04] people had had gotten real comfortable
[29:08] you know they just they just get get
[29:10] comfortable
[29:12] and and then uh you know that's the
[29:15] Diego was saying on Friday
[29:18] you know he says uh being comfortable is
[29:21] is a pretty dangerous state to be here
[29:24] you know I don't believe that we were
[29:27] called to be in a state of comfort
[29:32] because you know when you're comfortable
[29:34] nothing gets done
[29:37] yeah nobody does anything
[29:39] you know when people are just relaxing
[29:43] but he's awakened out of his sleep
[29:51] and you know the Angel and the angels
[29:55] just declares a vision to him shows him
[29:57] a vision
[30:00] and uh you know he he lets them know
[30:04] you know that um this is uh this is
[30:07] something that that it was happening
[30:10] hey you know I just want to read again
[30:14] I want to start I want to start there in
[30:16] verse 7.
[30:18] where he says you know who art that old
[30:21] great mountains
[30:26] yes thou shall become a plane
[30:30] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[30:32] thereofs
[30:36] crying Grace Grace unto it
[30:40] but you know it was the time where like
[30:43] I said they were just uh it was they
[30:45] were just relaxed
[30:47] you see the the foundation had been laid
[30:51] and you know it's it's great when we
[30:54] have uh when we see progress and
[30:57] fundamental foreign
[31:12] amen amen you see sometimes you know we
[31:15] start doing something
[31:18] and you know we get full of excitement
[31:21] but you know we don't go past the past
[31:24] what the first phase
[31:28] amen amen you know what the people they
[31:30] saw they saw these great mountains
[31:35] these are great obstacles
[31:38] you don't come in one way or another
[31:43] and uh and before you know it
[31:46] you know it just kind of smashed them
[31:49] they just it just smashed there the the
[31:52] their uh their hopes
[31:55] esperanzas and uh and you know they just
[31:57] can't everyone kind of stop stop doing
[31:59] work
[32:01] they stop doing their service
[32:11] you know they just uh they just just
[32:13] pretty much gave up for a while
[32:16] and you know it was it was I I believe
[32:19] it got to where it was a chaos
[32:22] you know and you know I think we're
[32:25] living in in a a very similar time
[32:28] you know I want to read a quote from
[32:30] brother Brandon
[32:33] oh maybe he says this in that quote
[32:39] let me uh
[32:41] it says he says this he says see you
[32:44] know just speaking about the time and
[32:46] the age that we're living in
[32:48] you know and uh you know just for a
[32:51] title before I get ahead of myself
[32:55] I want to title it conquering in chaos
[33:00] amen amen how many know what chaos is
[33:06] just it's yeah it's it's disorder that's
[33:09] that's all then you know and it brings
[33:10] confusion
[33:12] you know it brings us so many things
[33:15] into our lives you know when there is
[33:18] chaos you know we know that God is not
[33:22] there
[33:23] because God is not a god that is all
[33:28] disorders
[33:30] amen amen a god when when he speaks
[33:35] he he speaks into the chaos
[33:38] and he brings order
[33:41] or there amen amen and that's why we're
[33:43] here
[33:44] because you know we've gotten a little
[33:47] chaotic
[33:50] amen amen how many have been there
[33:53] you know what you just don't know what's
[33:55] going on
[33:56] so you don't know where you're going oh
[33:59] you don't even know if you're a
[34:00] Christian sometimes
[34:03] God speaks
[34:06] at him and he brings you back
[34:09] he brings us back
[34:12] you know that's that's the time that
[34:14] we're living
[34:15] you know a time of Chaos in a time of
[34:19] where you know the world doesn't know
[34:21] what's going on
[34:26] amen amen I'm gonna read this quote real
[34:29] quick
[34:30] it says I don't believe that a person
[34:34] just happened to be here by chance
[34:39] it says now just think
[34:42] it says when you come to the world
[34:44] everything had to be for prepared for
[34:47] you or
[34:49] pre-prepared
[34:55] this is for you
[34:57] it says I don't hardly understand how
[35:00] that how we that we could think that a
[35:03] God that could prepare all these good
[35:05] things for us would not we could not put
[35:08] trust in him they said
[35:20] it says that if he brought us in this
[35:23] chaos that we're in now and prepared the
[35:26] good things of life for us here how much
[35:29] more can we trust him to prepare the
[35:31] things that is to come the
[35:46] Eternal things
[35:47] it seems I say very strange
[35:52] it says I believe that heaven is a real
[35:55] place
[35:57] that's a nice paragraph it says uh no I
[36:01] believe that heaven is a is a real place
[36:03] just the same as this is a real place
[36:10] that's the wrong quote
[36:12] this is for God started us in our
[36:14] spiritual growth in this place
[36:17] is
[36:27] and I believe that heaven is a place
[36:29] just as real as this
[36:31] where we don't sit up there for eternity
[36:34] and just sit there on a cloud
[36:42] it says we don't just strum our heart
[36:44] for all all from here ever but we're
[36:48] going to a real place where we're going
[36:50] to do things
[37:01] and we're going to live
[37:04] it says we're going to work
[37:08] we're going to enjoy it
[37:10] says we're going to live
[37:13] we're going to life
[37:15] to a real eternal life
[37:19] we're going to a heaven a paradise but
[37:24] just like Adam and Eve
[37:31] foreign
[38:31] and that's why chaos exists for us to
[38:34] existence because there's going to be
[38:36] somebody
[38:37] there's going to be a son or daughter of
[38:39] God that is gonna come out and we'll be
[38:44] called conquerors
[38:49] I don't care what it is
[38:51] oh you will conquer
[38:55] stands
[38:59] in the midst of the chaos
[39:02] amen amen I believe it a 100 percent
[39:07] and I believe that when he's been he's
[39:11] speaking here
[39:14] who had laid the foundation
[39:17] he wakes them up out of sleep
[39:21] you know because I believe he had a
[39:23] colleague
[39:25] just like every one of us
[39:27] you see you you may have just begun
[39:31] foreign
[40:17] all right
[40:22] when we uh talk about a calling
[40:25] as Sarah Babel had a calling
[40:28] we have to understand
[40:30] that we were all not all called to do
[40:33] the same thing
[40:36] somewhere called the preach
[40:39] others were called the cuts
[40:42] others were called to to play
[40:45] instruments
[40:47] all of this record this thing
[40:50] we all have something different we do
[40:53] you know and even if you're not doing
[40:56] anything anything uh you know else
[41:00] I believe we were called to encourage
[41:02] one another
[41:03] question
[41:09] this kind of story comes to mind
[41:12] it was about it was about four brothers
[41:30] [Music]
[41:50] you know he runs and he calls friend he
[41:53] goes and he goes and gets help
[41:55] and then uh the other one you know he's
[41:59] over there he's a
[42:01] he trying to throw a stick to his
[42:03] brothers
[42:07] and then you know the dad comes you know
[42:11] and he saves the Sun
[42:13] and uh you know he he or calls it to her
[42:16] and he calls them all to accounts
[42:20] and he and he sits him down
[42:26] what'd you guys do when he fell in
[42:28] question
[42:30] one of them says well I ran to go get
[42:33] hell you know
[42:34] and then the other one
[42:37] the next all this is that well I just I
[42:41] just grabbed a branch and I tried to
[42:43] bring him in
[42:46] you know and then the youngest one
[42:49] he was just a little guy
[42:52] he couldn't do a whole lot
[42:59] but I I was motivating him
[43:10] and I can tell you this morning
[43:49] you know I think we're all in familiar
[43:52] paths here
[43:54] there's a lot of things that we haven't
[43:56] seen yet a lot of things we haven't done
[43:59] perhaps
[44:01] muchas
[44:03] and you know it's harder to do yeah
[44:06] when there's so much obstacles
[44:11] there's so much uh there's so much
[44:13] negativity
[44:16] I mean I could just imagine
[44:19] this man they had laid the foundation
[44:25] that's what the Bible
[44:44] you know and it just kind of just it
[44:46] just starts wearing you down
[44:49] it just it just it just wears on you
[44:52] come okay
[44:57] that's exactly what what happens
[45:00] to get wore out
[45:03] because you know it's if it's if it's
[45:06] not one thing it's another question
[45:09] if it's not the children it's the
[45:11] brothers
[45:19] and then you ask yourself
[45:24] why is this happening
[45:32] he wants to bring it out he wants to
[45:36] bring the best things
[45:43] but you may not know
[46:13] [Applause]
[46:17] [Music]
[46:46] wahoo
[47:33] before it actually started
[47:36] before I started my career Mi Carrera
[47:40] they actually uh read um a list of a lot
[47:43] of things
[47:47] that I took to be a lineman okay
[47:53] and uh
[47:55] they were they were pretty they was
[47:58] pretty rough yes
[48:01] you know I think that uh I think there
[48:04] should you know be a list
[48:10] because everybody has their list
[48:14] what it takes to be a real Christian
[48:19] I believe it oh we're not here we're
[48:22] gonna lie to people
[48:24] I'm not up here to lie to you
[48:28] and tell you but then it's gonna be it's
[48:31] gonna be nothing but roses
[48:37] oh you know I mean I'm not gonna tell
[48:40] you that
[48:41] I'm gonna tell you it's gonna be rough
[48:45] it's gonna be hard
[48:49] it's gonna be cold sometimes
[49:16] we are not here by foreign
[49:55] foreign
[50:28] because the list was rough
[50:32] these requirements weren't easy
[50:35] you required you to not be scared of
[50:38] heights
[50:41] it requires you
[50:43] to wake up in the middle of the night
[50:48] but when the conditions were below
[50:51] freezing
[50:55] uh when when the conditions
[50:58] oh we're very windy
[51:01] when there was tornadoes are you weren't
[51:04] gonna be able to run like everybody else
[51:08] you were gonna have to go and you were
[51:11] gonna and you and you had a calling
[51:14] and you had the answer to the call
[51:17] you know we all have a choice here
[51:20] you can answer to the calls
[51:24] or you can walk away
[51:28] you don't want the time by the time the
[51:30] the
[51:32] schooling was over
[51:34] One More Time by the time that the
[51:36] schooling was over
[51:43] um
[51:44] you know by the time we I had finished
[51:47] the school
[51:50] terminal Escuela there was only six left
[51:53] yeah says and uh
[51:57] of those things
[51:59] you know some of them tried it
[52:02] they got jobs
[52:05] but there's only five remaining
[52:09] but you know there was a lot of them
[52:12] were honest with themselves
[52:14] we try to talk them into it
[52:19] hey man it's gonna be okay
[52:22] and then one guy I remember he told me
[52:26] he said I can't do it man
[52:28] I like my sleep
[52:31] no he just he didn't he didn't want to
[52:33] wake up
[52:34] like man I'm not gonna go out there man
[52:37] I like sleeping
[52:40] that's just what he liked to do
[52:43] that's what he enjoyed
[52:45] he enjoyed that more
[52:48] you know then you know going into the
[52:51] into the work
[52:53] get into where it gets real tough
[52:57] into Christians sometimes
[52:59] you run into Christians
[53:02] and uh you know you you'll tell them
[53:04] what you believe
[53:06] I ran into us I ran into a sister one
[53:09] time
[53:10] and uh you know she was warning her
[53:12] husband yeah
[53:17] and uh she was like hey uh you better
[53:20] watch out man
[53:22] she was like those people they're not
[53:25] playing
[53:26] and I just kind of started laughing
[53:30] because she realizes she was playing
[53:32] church
[53:35] but that's what she said
[53:37] they're not playing man they're for real
[53:40] yeah
[53:41] you believe that it should be the same
[53:44] thing here
[54:09] he says
[54:15] glory to God Amen he says now out of
[54:19] this first key that we have receded of
[54:21] the Lord
[54:22] it's the one that says blackout
[54:24] it says okay there comes another and
[54:27] slightly less wonderful truth
[54:30] is
[54:38] I said I said that the true church would
[54:41] always try to be like it was in the book
[54:43] of Acts
[54:47] like
[54:49] that is exactly right
[54:53] we have discovered that
[54:57] the word also teaches an invasion of
[55:00] error until there is complete blackout
[55:08] of Truth in the last days
[55:12] when the Lord is about to appear
[55:15] this is the question now arises in our
[55:18] minds
[55:20] does God forsake his own and let them
[55:23] follow into a state of complete
[55:25] deception
[56:07] the people that are called to live in
[56:09] this time of chaos foreign
[57:27] Una foreign
[58:28] oh you start getting tired

[58:37] that that's what I had signed up for
[58:39] okay
[58:42] that's what I signed up for my team and
[58:46] so I was willing to accept that because
[58:53] under those conditions
[59:50] that's what he's gonna do foreign
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:15] it's uncomfortable
[1:00:19] I want to let you
[1:00:21] listen it won't always be that way
[1:00:32] what the Bible says
[1:01:05] that I was gonna be all right
[1:01:09] amen amen that's what he says
[1:01:21] that there are greater things ahead yeah
[1:01:26] foreign

[1:07:54] come on
[1:08:00] when we talk about
[1:08:03] conquering in chaos
[1:08:08] I've come to realize one thing
[1:08:13] people are always uh
[1:08:16] speaking
[1:08:18] I've heard this you know so many times
[1:08:21] is
[1:08:25] no it's not fair
[1:08:29] it's not fair is it okay this person
[1:08:33] esta Persona you know lives like this
[1:08:37] and God still blesses him
[1:08:40] it's not fair
[1:08:44] that he gets away with doing wrong
[1:08:47] okay
[1:08:50] and nothing happens to him
[1:08:55] it sounds like asaph the musician
[1:08:57] it's a character
[1:09:03] he's like why is
[1:09:05] why is it that this
[1:09:08] Persona why is it that I serve in church
[1:09:11] yeah and I try my best intento mejor and
[1:09:15] then I look out there in the world
[1:09:18] and they have an abundance of riches
[1:09:22] they have an abundance of us so much
[1:09:26] and I'm barely I'm barely making it
[1:09:31] I'm barely hanging on Apen
[1:09:34] it's not fair
[1:09:36] you know I've I've come to understand
[1:09:41] I've come to understand here in this
[1:09:43] place
[1:09:45] that we were all called to do something
[1:09:49] it is
[1:10:21] I realized
[1:10:24] that life may not be fair
[1:10:29] but that doesn't mean that God isn't
[1:10:31] fair
[1:10:33] sometimes we gotta carry some weight
[1:10:37] we gotta carry weight that others won't
[1:10:39] carry
