[26:50] symbol
[27:04] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[27:05] and understand all mysteries and all
[27:07] knowledge and though i have all faith so
[27:09] that i can remove mountains and have no
[27:11] not charity i am nothing
[27:15] else

[27:30] me nothing el amore sufrido
[27:41] charity suffers long and is kind charity

[28:31] be prophecies they shall fail where
[28:33] there be tongues they shall cease
[28:35] whether there be knowledge it shall
[28:37] vanish away
[28:38] let us pray father celestial father
[28:44] first of all my heart is so grateful
[28:48] for how good you have been towards us
[28:52] you have been good with us in our church
[28:56] helped
[28:59] [Music]
[29:10] i ask you for my brethren over there
[29:12] that are connected
[29:15] to california likewise our brothers from
[29:17] california
[29:21] and the others that connect around the
[29:22] world lord senor que tu puede
[29:34] precious name of the lord jesus christ
[29:36] amen amen
[29:38] you may be seated
[29:57] a lot of love and we are very grateful
[29:59] towards them um
[30:04] the subject i spoke on over there uh
[30:09] it's so real to them as it is to us as
[30:11] well
[30:14] the only thing that will endure
[30:16] is is love reputable
[30:19] repeat this after me
[30:36] the only thing
[30:40] the only thing that will endure is el
[30:42] amor is love
[30:50] the only thing that has enough strength
[30:51] to
[30:52] to endure
[30:55] is love
[31:16] it will come against
[31:30] because his time is winding down
[31:33] and you know
[31:38] when you have the last seconds last
[31:40] minutes
[31:42] you want to give it all
[31:44] and the
[32:12] he doesn't have much time left
[32:17] and he will attack us with everything he
[32:19] can
[32:21] the bible speaks to us
[32:25] there were four times
[32:40] horse
[32:43] was the red horse
[32:45] and it was the the bit of black
[32:48] but in this last time
[32:52] horses together
[33:07] but i've found out of one thing
[33:43] [Music]
[34:03] is
[34:20] that is exactly what has been attacked
[34:22] in our time el diablo the devil
[34:26] knows
[34:29] that love is the only thing
[34:59] and i spoke to the the brethren
[35:07] the child of a mother
[35:10] i've shared it here previously
[36:23] because let me tell you the emotions
[36:24] they don't last very long
[36:28] emotions don't last very long
[36:31] for serving god
[36:34] through emotions or because of emotions
[36:59] [Music]
[37:06] in church
[37:09] instead of taking you out
[37:13] because he knows that if he has you in
[37:14] church he has you deceived
[37:18] but he wants you in a lukewarm state
[37:42] [Music]
[38:44] partner
[38:46] i was listening to that this morning
[38:50] a pardon is not a partner unless you
[38:52] receive it as a pardon
[38:56] and love is not love
[38:58] unless
[39:15] [Music]
[39:54] but he got a hold of her
[39:57] and and sarah says

[40:03] i want to let you know
[40:06] although you have my
[40:07] father in your hands
[40:36] [Music]
[41:31] such a lukewarm state
[41:35] how can we solamente

[48:06] [Music]
[48:17] first of all i'd like you to please
[48:19] stand and i'll open your uh your
[48:21] scriptures with me
[48:24] the book of luke chapter 2 verse 49.
[48:29] when you have it you could say amen
[48:32] amen
[48:41] [Music]
[48:52] we'd like to thank our brothers and send
[48:54] a lot of greetings and love
[48:56] and thank them for everything that they
[48:58] did for us
[49:03] just so that you would know how you
[49:04] treated us
[49:06] how they treated us
[49:11] i'm not a half the person
[49:13] half the person that they are or the
[49:15] people that they are
[49:16] you know necesitable
[49:18] and i needed to see that
[49:22] scripture says like this and says
[49:25] jesus
[49:29] uh he said unto them him speaking to his
[49:30] mother uh mary cuando alvidaro
[49:34] they left him in the city
[49:42] how was it that you sought me was he not
[49:44] that i must be about my father's
[49:46] business
[49:48] you may be seated
[49:54] the the business of the lord jesus
[49:55] christ son lost my
[50:13] [Music]
[50:24] my pastor spoke of before i i came up
[50:26] here es es lo que paso that's what
[50:29] happened
[50:36] and quickly i'd like to thank the
[50:37] brothers
[51:35] because i needed help
[51:39] and quickly just to testify
[51:42] okay
[51:47] you all heard that since last year i've
[52:04] is love
[52:07] even says that faith
[52:10] and the knowledge
[52:14] maybe my obedience will cease one day
[52:19] and that's why the lord knew i had to go
[52:21] to this trip what a camp because
[52:27] during the preaching of brother tito on
[52:29] sunday estoy
[52:44] and it became a revelation
[52:47] because the lord revealed it
[52:50] maybe not the first time that i heard it
[52:55] but the second time he did reveal it to
[52:56] him
[52:58] brother
[53:05] imagine if you had two drops of blood of
[53:08] the lord jesus christ in your hands
[53:27] to those drops of blood of the lord
[53:28] jesus christ
[53:32] but more even more special
[53:35] is what that blood brought or bought
[53:40] and if you
[53:54] i don't know if you're
[54:24] but
[54:25] because of love
[54:31] before it was a routine to come to
[54:32] church it was and it was through
[54:34] obedience
[54:36] just in being
[54:47] because something more precious than the
[54:49] blood of the lord jesus is here
[55:09] [Music]
[55:33] work
[55:37] and we have to take care of what god
[55:38] does
[55:41] because they're the the lord's business
[55:45] to take care of the father's business
[55:58] and a small flame has been lit a flame
[56:00] of love pero
[56:03] but a little bit of love is still love
[56:07] god bless you
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:25] i would like to tell the youth from here
[56:27] um
[56:42] at
[57:09] we can't be double-minded or
[57:34] serving in church
[57:36] don't undermine that he knows
[57:45] [Music]
[57:53] siandonhoven so i being a young man
