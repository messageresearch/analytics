tonight can we give a clap offering to the Lord Jesus Christ amen amenu amen I believe the Lord is here why because you are here Brethren I can see God in you and I believe we are a thankful people when we come to worship the king of King and Lord of lords reading the words just as we're standing we'll be reading in chapter five of The Book of Daniel we'll continue with the biblical characters and you know our character is Daniel let's read from verse one and on and it says Bazar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his Lords and drank wine before the [Music] thousand Bazar whilst he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and the silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar have taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives and his concubines might drink [Music] therein then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem and the King and his princes his wives and his concubines Drank in them let us pray brother blessed loving Heavenly Father Lord we come before your presence we have read your word Lord your word is true your ways are just help us in this evening Lord may your word have an effect every one of us that we not leave empty Lord you that are the king of glory help us treasure your word Lord help this word Lord manifest in our lives that we testify Lord that there's a living God and a God that continues to work same yesterday today and forever you thanks Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated brother we're going to speak a little of this feast but before I would like to tell you I believe that as the Bible says he was a man with a purpose Danel had a purpose in his heart I don't know what purpose you came to church if you came to receive from God or you just came to be seen because many times brother we don't come to church with an expectation it doesn't matter who's preaching God's word brother it's living and edifying at least one word has to have an effect in our hearts and to say Lord if I've let you down if I something wrong in this evening I want to ask for forgiveness to please you that's why I'm here to serve you because this Daniel brother I believe he wanted to serve God the time he was in Babylon he did not mix himself with people what he did was he was a man of Prayer he pray three times a day he trusted in God he knew he knew God who delivered him from those people that we see since the beginning how Nebuchadnezzar got to Jerusalem and besieged it there was war and there was many casualties but they brought the people to Babylon Jerusalem who is Jerusalem Jerusalem is the city of the great God how many believe that Jerusalem is Holy anyone that curses Jerusalem will be cursed who blesses Jerusalem will be blessed that's what I believe with all my heart Luke 17e says I like it because the prophet and my brother Fidel I remember he read it the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is and Every Man Press into it so this is an effort lie brother is an effort you are an overcover today I believe you were an overcomer today not here because brother BL was going to preach I believe but that's what God wants it a privilege and a pleasure to be here along with our pastor a great pleasure brother Matthew 11:12 says from the days of John the baptis until now the kingom of violence take it by force how many violent Hallelujah brother these are the on that God there's a reward for all of these Brave Revelation 3:21 this is not just overcoming now every day of service at our homes wherever share God's word the prophet said a true fellow through God's wordu Hallelujah brother it says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne brotheru hallelujah what a joy will that be when we finish this race and the Lord tells us welcome faithful servant oh to the joy of your salvation Joy of your salvation in this very moment you would be in that Joy because not anyone giv salvation anyone give salvation I tell you because I'm a witness I tell you because I've witnessed God's power I'm going to read one more scripture of how Nebuchadnezzar was also a witness of that many have read the entire Book of Daniel brother nezzar was the king he was a proud King he like good things he wanted to be like God he wanted to be in charge he wanted to be like God forgive me brother are we happy Brothers my pastor used to say the one that used to be my pastor he passed he used to say it's true I'm preaching to you here I can also see your face I can see if you're happy if you're angry smil praising God I'm not speaking on my own account speak on my own God's word and the message of the because we know the Lord Jesus Christ search the scriptures because the eternal life is this is eternal life this is not just any word abzar had to [Music] recognize bless be the Lord Brother says and at the end of Nebuchadnezzar here I'm G to tell you one thing I was just telling my pastor brother Titus I compare myself to Nebuchadnezzar I was a man that was very I was very proud have witnesses here are brothers that I I would like to fight a lot I was very Nezar brother he was the king and he was he had a lot of money you understand he would order a lot of people but he was prideful in his heart he thought he would become as God so God cursed him God told told him that his dwelling would be with the beasts in the field he would be showered with the de of it says that his hair he was a mad man do you understand what a mad man is that was me brother but what is it say here at the end of the days a man without God isn't anything a young lady young man without God isn't anything the prophet says a man without God and this is worse than an animal Abazar was says izzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and my understanding returned unto me hum anyone that is prideful brotherr so not to make our John the Baptist said I need to wa I don't have to do anything for Jus grow for the Lord Jesus to grow for God can do the work in US you have to become nothing not to think that you're better than someone else or I know more than they no oh hallelujah [Music] hallelujah he does not come in through those those windows he descends from his glory there was a feast here sent to bring the sacred cups of vessels he was also a arrogance and a young man he was a young man he was a man with money he wanted to have a feast he did have a feast we're going to so he had the feast brother sent to bring the vessels those vessels were sacred he began to drink from those he thought God was not watching him why brother because he lived in a palace the prophet of the hour says is the sixth seventh wonder of the world it was aity with big something extraordinary in the future home and the the prophet says that they were was a copy of the newus that was a copy of the New Jerusalem there were Gardens that were hanging there was a path that led all the way to the throne there was a copy of the you and I will dwell with how many believe that brother hallelujah hallelujah to his name are sent and he thought God was not watching but brother God sees everything you could deceive the pastor me your brother your wife your mother God can't be mocked God can't be mocked remember God is watching doesn't matter where you go from on high and he descends from his glory he is here in this moment I believe it I believe it with all my heart so he began to drink he was drunk and said I'm the one in charge here nothing's going to happen hand appeared the word of God says some fingers writing on the wall you've read the scripture right all of those people when they seen that was something Supernatural that is something superal I believe it with all my heart I another time I'll tell you of a super so that hand wrote something on the wall let me read it to you brother blessed be the Lord a lot of time left time goes by quickly time goes by quickly now in this very moment we are in eternity we are in eternity brother believe it Brothers thanks be to God God is good and this is a writing that was written may may of faren this is the interpretation of the them may God has numbered th Kingdom and finished it thou areces that are found wanting Paris thy kingdom is divided and given to the MS of Persian and Persians Brethren he was found wrong he was found shorted oh bless I don't want to be I don't want to fall short in the presence now this is a a living testimony now is the time to be in accounts with the Lord the balance is still set and God is weighing us because the prophet says the devil counts his own when you see a big multitud say the church is prospering but no God weighs the spirit he weighs his own and he knows what caliber you're made out of my time is over brother I'm G to let our pastor come and God bless you amen please stand for a moment let's read chapter six of Daniel now Daniel Daniel 6 we'll be speaking on the lion might have seen in a cartoon or a movie or you've read it I'm not going to read the entire chapter but we know it's about Daniel that's who we're talking about this scripture takes place after the kingdom of Babylon is removed and conquered by Persian MS and now it says that they Place Daniel as one of the governors it pleased Darius he was the king of the Persian mes to set over the kingdom and 120 princes which should be over the whole Kingdom and over these three presidents of whom Daniel was first now notice there was 120 presidents let's say over all the king it was not only just one country it was many countries 12 over those countries and over those 120 there were three men and one of them was Daniel that the princess might give accounts unto them and the King should have no damage [Music] then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent Spirit was on him and the King thought to set him over the whole realm you may be seated now let's dive into the lions den that's where we want to want to get to hopefully we want to introduce Daniel here again and how he made it to the lies Den now the Bible tells us in verse three that Daniel was preferred above presidents and princes because an excellent Spirit was in him it was not his intelligence what made him special although he was very intelligent it was not his riches it was not his knowledge something different inside him from the rest God's children are different from everyone else I don't understand today how we want to be the same like everyone else Daniel didn't care to be the same like everyone else Daniel was happy being different from the rest what made him better what made him stand out it wasn't his knowledge the Bible says the spirit that was in [Music] him what put him in that position what lifted him to such a point was that he was a spiritual man youth don't be afraid to be spiritual over your education over your knowledge over your status your friends seek to be spiritual what took Daniel to where he was was was that he was a man that had communication with God he knew what worship was they looked for him not just because of his knowledge but because he could interpret Visions because God spoke to him in the previous chapter the chapter brother Blas read we know that Bazar calls Daniel and says Daniel I've heard that God listens to you oh hopefully the people can know that God listens to his children let me tell you God listens to his children start tells Daniel Daniel I heard that you can interpret dreams that you speak with God he looked for him because he spoke with God that's what had him in that place because he was a spiritual man don't be afraid of being spiritual they offered him everything I'll dress you with fine cloth I'll give you this I'll give you that I'll make you the third in the kingdom and Daniel says I don't care about any of that I don't care what you can offer all I want is what God can give me that's the type of man Daniel was he was a praying man he was a spiritual man verse four says then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could but they could find none occasion nor fall for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against his concerning the law of his God in other words we have to do something against his religion we have to do something against his Devotion to God that's the only way we'll make Daniel stumble what do they do they went to the king and told the king king there is none like you there's none like you King everyone to honor you and no one ask anything from any other God for 30 days for 30 days that no one ask anything from any other God I'm I'm sure they imagined that Daniel would not stand 30 days without praying to God their surprise was that he couldn't even stand a couple hours without being with his God the King was in agreement and it says in verse 10 now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and look watch Daniel watch what a courageous man now when knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time now look here Daniel did this all the time this was his custom before he went to the Lion's Den he was prepared because he had communication with God he didn't start praying when he got to the Lion's Den he prayed every day three times a day number one I believe he prayed so many times because he knew he needed so much from God in an unknown land let's say let's say he was with foreigners with different uh strange Traditions he had been there for a long time but I imagine just like it is today as time passes the trials get tougher and we need God not once a week not three times a week every moment couldn't wait a day without his God I believe in the place he was he recognized need from his God May there be people today that recognize the great need of God in their lives there's youth brothers that there's adults and fathers parents that recognize that we can't survive with just coming to church no I need him every moment without him I can't number two I believe he prayed three times a day to his God following what Solomon said in First Kings chapter8 and on Solomon many years before many years before Daniel King Solomon the king of Israel he dedicated a temple to God and while he dedicated his Temple the glory of God came down and I believe the prayer he made was anointed by God and now he speaks of the symbol or significance of the temple the temple was in Jerusalem and he says in verse 46 if they sin against thee for there is no man that how many can acknowledge this how many Sinners are in here there are some that maybe need to lift two hands maybe two feet if they sin against thee and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the [Music] enemy so they can carry them away captives unto the land of far or near now notice here what happened with Daniel and [Music] Israel yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whether they shall were carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinned and have done perversely we have committed wickedness and so return unto thee with all their heart and with all their souls in the land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city which thou H has chosen and the house which I have built for th name it says then hear thou their prayer their suppli in heaven thy dwelling [Music] place and maintain their cause notice Daniel knew this scripture Daniel knew thaton prayed one time when this Temple was in his glory glory of the Lord filled this Temple and he believed in Solomon's words that if they were carried away Daniel was carried captive but if they turned their face the city of Jerusalem although it was far from them although they could not see although they couldn't see it although the city was in ruins the temple in rues were not destroyed hallelujah hallelujah brother the temple Promises of God were faithful there was a man that believed them that man was Daniel he believed God's promises and he open his windows to face Jerusalem to pray towards Jerusalem he wasn't challenging anyone that was his life that was his C life trying to be seenly his Devotion to God brother you don't have to act different outside who you are if you're a Son of God if you're a Christian Don't Be Afraid come on Church come on you to be who you are don't be afraid of where you come out don't be afraid of what you believe you will hear from and maintain their cause and forgive thy people they have sinned against you all their transgressions transgress against you and give them compassion before them who carried them captive how tremendous how tremendous Daniel was a witness of this scripture he could testify and say I have kept God's word I stood up for God's word he has stood up for me for they be thy people and thine in which thou broughtest forth out of from the midst of the Furnace of iron this is what Daniel had in his heart oh hallelujah hallelujah brother what a brave man what a strong man in his faith he maintained in prayer he maintained in prayer and prayer maintained him he maintained in the faith of God that they took everything away from him I believe he prayed because it was something they couldn't take away they took his friends away they took his family they took his land away they took everything away but he was decided would they wouldn't take that away would there be youth here Lord raise you and women here they can't take this away from they can't take my faith they can't take my prayer stand for their God Daniel keeps saying chapter verse 14 the gossipers came and told the king and the King could not retract then the King which he heard these words was sord dis pleased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him the to deliver him then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king know oh King that the law of the am and Persians is that no decree nor statute which the king establishe may be changed then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him in the of lions now the king spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee verse 17 says and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the King he sealed it with his own sign and with the signate of his Lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel now look capture Daniel they take them to the take him to the king he has no remorse not asking for Aid he is isn't afraid let me tell you when you've served God you have no remorse you stood up for God up for God when youve served God doesn't mean you haven't made mistakes we going to make mistakes for God even then tell you have to be ashamed of your God be ashamed of everything else from your God something proud about of God we serve let me tell you sometimes it seems that we're more PR proud of our vehic our shoes our clothes let me tell you there should be something it's the type of God we serve I'm proud of is my God Paul said if I can be if I can boast of something it's about my God because my God has never left me my god when I was unlovable God forgave so many times so many times PR hallu Hallelujah someone here that say that I serve proud he's done for me I am not anything I'm not anything but he is everything he did not repent there was no remorse in him he didn't ask for help he knew he did the right thing and when you know you've done the right thing when you know you've tried when you know you haven't been playing Church when you know you've asked God for forgiv sincere with God Don't Be Afraid of Anything don't be afraid of anything when they put him in the denave no say I don't know may I'm gonna be eaten by lions I don't want to look maybe he closed his eyes maybe close his eyes or the growl of the Lions they kept these Lions starving to devour anything in the denel knew that I imagine he close his eyes than God May heard the footsteps of the Lions the breath of the Lions and then after hearing he began to feel them I imagine maybe a lion or two or three got so close that he could feel their breath the hot breath of their mouth brandom says the message blind you can never put a saint anywhere but what God will come be with him one went into a belly of a wh God came and was with him three went into a fiery furnace God went and was with them one went into a lion's den God went with him you can't hide a saint from his godde a saint from his God worth serving that's why it's worth that's why it's worth will be stand for your God he won't leave you he won't forsake you trust in this evening TR in this evening have you believed in trust in him have you testified on him trust in your God come on Church asking for someone trust in their God you need to know that he has heard you come on church you've prayed to him you've prayed to him you've prayed to him how many times have you prayed he has heard you three times a day Daniel Prayed not a deaf God is God that listens to his children trust I feel that we come to church we come here trust in our God trust in our God trust he loves you oh youth he loves you trust say brother Titus I can't trust because I fell too many times I fa too I've sinned too much I understand I understand that we all fa we all sin but the Bible says if you pray to me I will forgive you you say I've sinned I can't trust in God I can't have trust but how much has he forgiven you I want to tell you I want to tell you tonight trust in God he will carry you when you can't carry yourself God does not need anyone to defend him he defends himself he knows how to defend his children God knows how to defend his word when you have held on to him when you have depended when you have said Lord I can't depend on my action I can't depend on my Deeds I failed you too much and I'll grab on to you now when you can't no longer when you can't defend yourself hold on to him hold on to his word hold on to his love TR in the type of God you Ser God is looking to trust him whoever draws believes that there is believes that he is true that he will stand for you said brother tius I haven't felt him I haven't seen him brother it's been a long time but in the time he will be there oh hallelujah hallelujah when you can't get up to help you up in the time you can't see the she will be there God's provided way at the end time says Daniel for the cause of God was thrown into a lion's den he needed a fence but God sent him an angel what a difference that was God's provided way he needed a f but God gave him an angel you say brother I need my healing I need money I need this I need [Music] that only God knows what you need God knows what you need he will send what you need he says what a better fence it [Music] was better than you ask for anyone that can say Amen to this he always gives you better than what you ask for hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah something better for you something better for you God gave Daniel something better I imagine that all of a sudden the growlings from the Lions those groanings groanings turn into snoring all of a sudden all the lions were still God didn't take him away from the problem but gave him a security in the problem I think Daniel that at night slept like no other night I believe he slept like a baby I believe that day he realized safest place he could be because a safe place isn't a specific location a safe place is God's love I repeat that the safe place is not a location it's not to have money it's not to have healing not that your body is healthy the safe place God's love God loves you if it's in a belly of a whale as long as he loves I am safe if it's next to a lion but as long as he loves me I am safe his love is my safety his love is what gives me peace I don't have money I don't have what I want rest have I have his love church is there someone here can say that's where I want to be I imagine that Daniel said never have I felt this safe he needed a fence and God sent him an angel God gave him something better he gave him an assurance he gave him and Assurance Blessed Assurance everything is well nothing is impossible it seems impossible but for God nothing is difficult gave him of his love [Music] oh gave him of his presence gave him of his spirit all of a sudden Daniel looked said I've never felt this [Music] safe imagine he found a spot next to those lions simply put himself in the God's love he was sleepy he was not [Music] worried a brother from the message that is in Israel now and he said the god of Israel does not sleep the god of his children doesn't sleep my God doesn't [Music] sleep sh the shoutings of King Darius Daniel Daniel was the morning it was the next day Daniel Daniel did your
