blessed we are Pastor when I give thanks to our pastor for giving us the opportunity to be here gracias thank you and also we pray for them wherever they're at now may God help them and may they be a blessing wherever they're at now okay there's a title that we put from the the message that I would like to speak today title is what is this love yo siento kids it is something you think about because what is This Love that God has for us let us read a scripture says John 3 16. when you have it you may say Amen this is for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believeth in him shall not perish but have he everlasting life uh you may be seated brethren I believe that God wants to come down here where where we at now is for that to happen we have to create an atmosphere where he can come down and move if you come with problems or things give it to him give it to him smile to your brother or sister besides you and give them a a nice little smile we should be happy our pastor just preached to us there is no reason for you to be sad no I purchase there's no reason to be sad we have a great love okay which is our Lord okay would like to start speaking a little bit of what God has been dealing with me God works different with every in each other well with me he's been working this way Familia my family we weren't a very loving family in ton says so Pastor will go or our brothers will go go and visit there in Napa uh pastoras our pastor used to tell us or tell me brother Samuel I love you buenos dias and for me it was like he was actually just telling me good morning I couldn't really understand the word I love you for me it was something normal something common but God on me is that love is God using him for us and I've seen that that love it can only be the love the love of God I've seen it in my wife foreign good and he's always showing himself if you can't really release and now I understand it but I really couldn't understand it now I see it I would like to read a quote so we can understand a little bit more the love of God this message is the cruelty of sin preach in 1953 these entrances puedo imaginarme so there I can imagine seeing that poor little Eve Miranda see in or looking at adamio her long blonde hair hanging down her back uh they were hanging down her back those big bright blue eyes yes they look like these guys where God had made them is the tears pouring down mixing with the blood of the garments and flapping down around her body Eva this is her [Music] his is and there the tears mingling falling as it run through the uh cheek skins blood dripping down blood all right now says you have to depart of my presence I can see Eve and Adam with their arms around one another going moving out like this yes then all cheekskins flopping against their legs bloody on their legs and tons then I can see all that space which was God is God has no beginning of days ending of years he's forever and forever I can see all the Great Space be beginning to move together like this is moving down to Eternal chair like that ibajo and then it moved right down as he began to the eye and Little Couple going down the garden and of Eve Les bloody skins dropping against their legs he couldn't spell and yo he couldn't stand it and it moved down and it moved down Trio and then he spelled amor l-o-v-o love yours God so loved else he just couldn't see them go that's how the love of God is great we have something so great that I hope that we can understand I could just imagine Eve crying she was something she was crying with a big burden in her heart something bitterness youth I remember in one of my hard times you guys have to be ready because the devil will come against you with everything he has and remember this one time our Brethren went to visit us in Napa [Music] I thought I had it all I told myself I'm good with God I believe I'm okay then a trial came uh before me one of the biggest trial of uh ever faced one of my biggest mistakes sometimes you tell your brother your dad or your mother I promise you I will not let you down but when you're when you truly tell God I will not let you down and you let him down foreign [Music] the same thing happened to me I was lost I was lost in this situation I was looking for God foreign departed for me just like he told them that they had to be departed from his presence I also departed from his presence but Brethren or India nowadays he has shown me his love one more time I've seen it I've seen it I could probably say I've also touched it just like God couldn't see them departed from Eden I believe he suffers when he sees us he paid a very great price I I wanna imagine it this way uh for a lot of days I've been thinking about it and I can imagine it this way I I kind of see it and place it like the devil's in one side and God is in the other side both are looking the things that we're going through here on Earth the devil's trying us for us to fight idios mirando and God watching is implemented and simply saying let them go they are my children no no no the devil says no no no I'm gonna try que Los Padres that the parents well hate their children and the children hate their parents I'm gonna try to do evil things with them in the heart of God has been said let them go they are my children leave them alone no chaos Anton says and they're arguing the devil says and God's response what do you want then ask me what do you want the devil responds there's one thing I would like quiero to Sangre I want your blood and this love that God has towards us he it made him it's okay it'll be my blood even though the devil will tell God they're gonna spit on you you're gonna turn the back on you they will spit on you and do do bad things but the decision of God was the devil was telling him the devil was telling them that we were going to turn our backs and we have because with our attitudes he was saying the truth but to a certain point that he's coming back for you just like you feel lost and take care of yourself thank you and God bless you [Applause] foreign [Music] we have to come too you're the word of God to feed ourselves because the word of God is food for us this is from the mouth of God when we come to this place Brothers I'm gonna and I struggled very much with the message in various times Brothers [Music] and you have chicken tiene foreign we lack the faith because he already died for us many times we say well I just don't know how to pray Brothers I've done it as well there was a little boy that's all he was saying was the alphabet es that's all he was saying Brothers he says let's read a scripture Second Kings with the help of God are we happy Brothers for internet and all the brothers that are watching us to the internet do we have a Brothers the word of God says like this paraquenos is now there were four men with Leprosy at the entrance of The City Gate they said to each other why stay here until we die MOS is if we say we'll go into the city the famine is there and we will die if we stay here we will die so let's go over to the camp of the aramians and surrender if they spare us we live if they kill us then we die noches at thus they got up and went to the camp of the irimians when they reached the edge of the camp no one was there yes to hear the sound of Chariots and horses in the great Army so that they said to want to look the king of Israel has hired the hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us yes so they got up and fled in the Dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys they left the campus it wasn't ran for their lives The Men Who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp entered one of the tents and they didn't drink they took silver golden clothes and went off and hit them they returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also bien foreign says for what is there anyone that can tell me no one remembers it says that the king of the syrians they began to eat the donkeys and it says that the head of a donkey it says that it was worth 80. let me see how much so I'm not lying to you pieces it's worth 80 pieces of silver right you're remembering now right those lepers so we can speak to people about Jesus Christ what do you do is my friend my friend is uh go and tell her go and tell her I also have that pain we have to take the gospel glory to God those lepers were there they had them and they said you almost said what are we gonna do okay let's eat all this food and they ate a little bit and they went and got more and hit it again and then they went and hit it again yeah and that's when they said we're doing something wrong we have to go and take the good news they're dying over there our brothers are over there dying am I our brothers are dying Brothers our family is dying Brothers and what are we doing for them I have a family family in Mexico a lot of family that they're dying but I don't lose hope one day seeing them here hallelujah and I'm sure when he went when he left his father every morning would go and look for him to see if his son was coming home because he knew that he was going to come home and I also don't lose hope that one day Hermanos see my brothers and my family coming to the feet of God glory to God just as those lepers did God bless you [Applause] guys the words of life how many he believed that there is a powerful God is a unique God is a God that loves his people This Is Love for us God has nothing if you can tell me what what of your life that God has forsaken you you can tell me in no time in no moment God has forsaken me God has been with you since the day you were born until today and why sometimes we doubt God or we forget if God has never forsaken us just like our brother Sammy said there is no reason to be sad God is with us the love of God there's no reason to be sad amen we have something great that I hope that we can understand God has never forsaken convince lady young man as brother and sister God loves you if you today or if this past week you've thought that God does not love you or God has forsaken you let me tell you God has not forgive us forsaken you guys God has not forsaken you okay what love is this that God he loved us so much that he sent his son Romano Romans 5 8 says like this but God demonstrates his love well we were still sinners Christ died for us Christ died Christ died for you Christ died for me verse of John 4 9 says like this this is how God showed his love Among Us I want you to make it personal in this God showed his love foreign for you and he sent his own and only son into the world that we might live through him this is love knowing not that we loved God Hernandez not that Timothy Hernandez love God look at Jacob not that Jacob loved God he loved us and send his son as an atoming sacrifice for our sins he knew you were you'd be here in this moment and what a what if God is waiting foreign how many love God I'm gonna read the paragraph a preacher said this is he is the king of the Jews he is the king of Israel he is the king of righteousness he is

forget who is God we forget what God is able to do God loves us church God loves each and every one of them God has not Forsaken and he will never forsaken you our God medios my God he is a God undescribable all right now I reflect in my own life and I start thinking how many times God always has taken me out on the US dollar from where I've been and I know a lot of us we could say the same thing we can say that God he has taken me out of my problems of my sicknesses of whatever life throws at me God has never forsaken his people but sometimes and Amigos we become enemies of the crossed of Christ sometimes we become enemies of the Cross of Christ but even though even then even then I want to say Cristo even though even then Christ he's still loving us even then Christ opportunity is still giving us another chance every day to give another step man the musicians can come forth brother Branham it says like this and the only way he could do era was to send Christ proposition he might come the prophet speciation of our sinsidos for that those who had been elected he could come bring to him in glory could you imagine God running his office so loosely well maybe someone will
