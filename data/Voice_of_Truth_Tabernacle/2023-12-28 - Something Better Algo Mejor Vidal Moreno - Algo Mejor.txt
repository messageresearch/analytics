[Music] God bless you uh good to be in the house of the Lord amen how many you're happy to be here let us uh open our Bibles um we opening um to the book of uh book of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 15 and 16 uh preaching on the the end of year uh the title is something better but amen amen amen uh Hebrews 11:15 verse 16 uh says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city we'll go to uh the Gospel of Luke Chapter 2 we'll be reading verse 25 and Luke 2 verse 25 and 26 Lucas cap it reads like this say and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ that let us bow our heads in prayer Heavenly Father uh we're grateful Lord for the opportunity you give us uh to speak your word Lord we ask that you anoint the lips that will be speaking the um as well as for my interpreter and ask that you just uh just move in the hearts of your people Lord we realize it's a Wednesday but it's a blessed day when we can come into your presence and we are just grateful for the opportunity you give us Lord to be in your presence once again just uh we are thankful Lord we ask that you see the needs of your people father those that are watching through the internet as well Lord those that are sick Lord those that are hungry those that are thirsty for right we ask that you just bless them where they are Lord and we just ask that you just give them their healing we just thank you for everything May at the end of the service your Holy Name be glorified we ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen uh you may be seated uh yeah I was uh talking with our pastor back in the back and uh uh one of the questions I used to ask myself uh when I would read uh uh the message messages expectations uh one of the things I'd always ask myself was why why does brother brandham talk about this man so much he he he preached on him quite often as a matter of fact probably sa more than 10 or 15 times he preached message expectations not exactly sure but it was it was more than 10 times for sure and uh one of the things you know that I I really uh God led me to uh to preach on of Simeon uh was uh you know how how devout you know he he was to what he did and uh you know he the history says that he was an elderly man nobody knows exactly how old he was uh but some people uh some people say that he could have been over the hundred years of [Music] age but nobody knows for sure and that just uh shows you know how devoted he was you know to uh to the Lord and how devoted he was to to the service of God and uh you know you have to really uh God really has to honor someone like that when you stand at your post of Duty I imagine every time he went to the to the temple uh I'm sure his legs hurt you know when you get up there in age it seems like everything hurts uh but uh he didn't allow his conditions or his circumstances you know to get in the way of what was told to him amen amen you see because God had revealed to him something you know that he would not see death you know until until he saw the consolation of Israel how many come expecting something this this uh this service I I I know it's a Wednesday but I believe it's a good day any anytime you can come to the house of God it's a good day I I believe that I believe God could work on a Wednesday just like he can on a Sunday it don't matter if you come expecting something then God can do it it just got to has to be revealed to you you know and this is the type of Revelation that that Simeon had amen amen you know we're getting close to the end of the year and uh you know uh Simeon was getting close to the end of his life oh but that didn't stop him from going to the house of God he may not have seen what he he was expecting yet but it didn't stop him you see you may not have seen what you're expecting this year but you can still have it you know if you're expecting amen amen you know the thing about it is a lot of times is that you know uh he was he he was he was expecting he was waiting for the consolation of Israel amen amen you know so that was the Revelation you know that he was expecting to obtain you know because when we come to church a lot of times you know God deals with individuals amen the Bible says it was revealed unto him that he was going to see the consolation of Israel Not only was he going to see it but he was going to hold it he was going to have it in his hands amen amen you know I I wouldn't that be something you see if what you were expecting you could possess you see his his sight may have been dimon you see because he was older in age you see but the but the eyesight of his faith it never damned it never weakened you see his legs may have been feeling shaky when he'd go to the temple but but he but his faith did not weaken because he wasn't looking at what he felt or the circumstances he was in or how much money he had or that he wasn't happy about what he got or didn't get he wasn't living in that moment you see he was looking ahead and that's how we should live see we shouldn't be looking at our circumstances we should be expecting something better amen amen he wanted something better we should want something better you know uh this time of year you know it was uh was telling you know uh some of the brothers while back you know there they're kind of hard for me sometimes you know grow growing up we we didn't we didn't get a whole lot you know there wasn't a whole lot to expect you know um one of the things you know that uh that that I guess that that affected me you know I I I honest I'm going to be honest with you I I I grew up to to hate days like like holidays like around this time I'm not trying to be a grinch or anything you know but uh I uh you know that green guy you know that on the cartoons you guys know you know but you know I I don't Christmas passed anyway I can't take nothing but uh the thing of it is is that you know I growing up as a child I wouldn't get a whole lot you know and that was kind of difficult it's kind of difficult to see other people getting things you know and uh you know I'd look outside and I see everybody else playing with their toys and you know you know we wouldn't really have very much uh but but you know so I wasn't really expecting a whole lot you know when I was younger you know but I think that God was building character the whole time amen you know I could live with or without you know the gifts you know but one thing I can't live without is him I can't live without Jesus you know he's the source of everything I have you know Paul said I am what I am by the grace of God you know and so God's been good amen he's been good you know he's you know if we didn't open anything else up you know we open up some tamales you know this uh this Christmas you know but but even so God's been good amen but you know even greater than that the greatest thing that he has been able to give us is that he has opened up his word that's the greatest thing God can do is to open up the word because that's the greatest thing that you can have he's opened up the word to his children amen amen he's opened it up and that's what makes me desire more I cuz I know there's something better amen amen but a lot of times we think that he's done uh but you know I I remember growing up you know I was barely you know starting to get to know the message and uh one of the things I I remember uh quite well was that you know the Lord revealed to me you know what I should do in my career and uh you know I remember I went in and I put in my two weeks notice you know I was trying to do the right thing and uh you know one of one of my the boss you know he he told me he said you know what he's like you leave and he's like I'll never hire you back you know and I remember telling him uh this I said uh you know uh Cliff cuz his name was Cliff Cliff uh you know I don't leave a place of of I don't leave a place you know uh so that I could come back to it you know I I I I I leave it because there's something better out there now I was just I was believing that there was something better out there you see I was expecting there was something better out there but you know I I didn't have it quite yet you see they had just told me about it and you know I think uh when uh you leave the service of the devil when you stop serving him he he don't like it he he doesn't he wants to keep you right there you know and he says I won't take you back if you leave if you take off I'm not getting you back and you know he didn't have a whole lot to begin with amen because if he did then I wouldn't be right here I wouldn't be here if the devil had something to offer me I would not be serving God Amen he's a liar he he lies about what he tells you and he and he and he just he just he's a he's just a liar you know but a lot of times we believe his Lies We believe what he's telling us we believe what he's what that what we have at the moment is good but my ambitions you see the Ambitions of a Son of God are not very low you see the standards have gone up and they've gone up substantially that's exactly right it wasn't just a little bit better I went from poverty uh to completely rich I am rich in Mercy I have I have I have so much peace I have so much love I got so much joy I have everything God has it's in the house it's in God's Storehouse and he can give it to you if you want it if you can accept it for you you see if you expecting that then God can give it to you but that's the problem we don't expect we're not expecting we're not in service I believe that Simeon was so careful to make it to the house of God uh because he was scared he was fearful that he might miss he might miss what God had promised him so I believe I I believe that when he got up he maybe his body hurts you know when I get up in the morning like I being I'm just my body's just popping all over the place my my bones are popping and and you know just you just get older and uh you know um CA you know she's like man you're Pop Rocks rocks you know you know it's a if you know English you know you you get it but but so basically you you I'll explain it to you later but but you know so my uh that that's your your body just pops you know you just get older and I believe the simeon's body was very frail and uh and you know he and but that didn't stop him because I know In the Flesh he wanted to stay laying down in the flesh he wanted to stay laying [Applause] down but you know he remembered he remembered the Revelation it was revealed unto him see a lot of people think that you know the Revelation comes uh when uh you're because you're a part of the church amen amen you see because people nowadays when you talk about church oh they are they they think about the building they think about this being the church you see but in all reality is that this building is not the church amen amen it's it's not the church you want me to tell you who the church is it's you you see you are the church amen amen so the Revelation doesn't come to a whole group it comes to an individual you see it was a private Revelation it was a revelation between him and God because if it wasn't then everybody else would have known everybody else in the temple everybody else in that Temple I would have known who Jesus was you see all the religious people they would have known but they didn't because it was not revealed unto them you see that's why that's why people act kind of different in church oh because something's been revealed to them something has happened in them they have got they have CAU the Revelation amen amen it's it's an individual Affair it's it's not just a religion it is a relationship it's a relationship and that's what God wants you see when you have re when you have a relationship oh then then things change you get to know the person on a more intimate level so that's when God or can be begin to reveal things and I believe that's the kind of relationship that Simeon had because the Bible says that the Holy Ghost was upon Him amen amen so he had some Revelation and until you until you don't get that new birth until you get the new rebirth you won't get any type of Revelation amen amen so that's what we want we want God you see to reveal to reveal to you what it is that you're needing to reveal to you what it is that you want amen amen I'm going to keep reading in verse 27 but the Bible says this and he came by the spirit into the temple you see he didn't come in the flesh but he came in the spirit you see I wonder how we come to the house of God how do we come in the spirit because if you come in the spirit then the spirit can do things you see the spirit moves you see it moved him or to go to the temple yeah his body may have been hurting you see he may have been he may have been not feeling very well that day but that did not stop him because when you get the spirit there's not a thing that can stop you from coming into the presence of God amen amen I believe it I believe it with all my heart I keep reading it says that when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the [Applause] law says then took he him him up in his arms and blessed God and said now let us thou serve thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for my eyes have seen thy salvation amen amen you see how I I want you to notice of that last part it says for mine eyes my eyes have seen thy salvation it wasn't the brother it wasn't brother Tito's eyes it wasn't brother Isaac's eyes you see it cannot be somebody else's eyes it has to be your eyes see you have to see it you have to want it you have to work for it but you have to go get it and the devil's going to do everything in his power to stop it he's going to do everything he can so that you look at anything else except for God's word because that's where the Revelation is the Revelation was given it's been given through a prophet amen amen and we believe it we believe it amen who believes it amen I I believe it I believe I believe then I'm standing amongst people that believe the same thing that are working for one cause working working for one purpose work serving one God under one spirit I believe it it's one it's one spirit I believe it I'm going to read a message it's well it's it's a quote from Brother brandom uh it says this I'm expecting greater things say I'm Baptist I'm Methodist I'm oness two is three or whatever you are you see that don't satisfy me I got Ambitions to move on till I meet him then he says up up up up up he says I receive the Holy Ghost that settles it it didn't with me that's what brother Bram says it says I'm still I'm just still taking it and I'm moving higher and higher just moving on way high high Ambitions expectations Ambitions says well we got a pretty nice little church we'll just settle down me and this little crowd that's not enough for me that is not enough for brother VI I I don't know about you but I am not satisfied with just a church building because I don't believe that God put us here to just chill out just relax but it's time to keep pressing we got to keep moving we have to keep believing keep expecting that God has more because when you believe it oh then God will take you to move one more time it will take you to move it will take you to do something because it's a revelation yes this this isn't it it's not it for me I came from a place and and you know it got to it gotten where you know I I just it got just so uh so traditional no the place where I come from and uh you know I just I couldn't believe it and and you know the devil is like this is it that's it you see that the message in my head he was telling me the devil you know he talks to you the message isn't real the Revelation is not [Applause] real but I just something inside me could not accept that because I had been with God you see when you catch the Revelation you don't beat into the lies you don't beat into your circumstances you don't feel into your feelings so many feelings we don't move by feelings we move by the spirit moved by the Holy Spirit that's what moves me what moves God's church and when it's a real Revelation it moves you it moves you more it'll take you higher it'll take you further and then you become some kind of weirdo you become a weirdo amen you what separates you from everybody else do you know what separates you it's your faith that's what separates you it's the truth because you you know but when you catch the Revelation you know this world isn't your home you just moving you can't be satisfied with these little things these things are nothing but this is not my home I got to go higher I got to go further I want more peace I want more Comfort I want consolation that's what I want these things don't satisfy me and uh you know imagine when people saw Simeon going to the temple imagine they'd look at him they'd laugh it'd mock them look at that crazy old man going to the temple and they'd say amongst themselves you know he's been doing it for years and there hasn't been a change there hasn't been a difference he's gotten older he's gotten a little crazier and nobody wants to be around him anymore even your own family doesn't want want to be around you sometimes you're too weird you're too different they talk about some Prophet they talk about Jesus's Second Coming they've been talking about that for years how ridiculous ain't that right isn't that right see I imagine that there was many many men of God that served along with Simeon and they had fallen away from the faith they couldn't wait they couldn't wait any longer their faith had weakened their eyes had dimmed but not Simeon Simeon had the eyes of an eagle he had the eyes of an eagle and I believe that he had the heart of a lion I believe that because a lion a lion won't give up a lion keep fighting it's not going to stop him or whatever he goes for or he takes it it's his it's not going to stop that's the kind of Faith he had that's the kind of Faith a son and daughter of God should have the eyes of an eagle because they caught the vision because they've got higher they've got higher and they've got higher and they've got higher they've got above their problems above their circumstances above their feelings above their situation am now keep in mind that Simeon was still in the flesh he was still in his body amen amen as long as you're in this body you'll have feelings you'll have those desires you'll have the opportunities to go back the opportunities are there on a daily basis every day there's an opportunity to go back when you're in this body because the flesh it fights against the spirit so every day unless you know you've uh you've already made it but you know I still have a ways to go I still have people you know I still have people I have to help the Lord still has to help me that's why it's so important you know to stay in the spirit be in the spirit you see when we when we preach up here you see when the minister are up here brother Tito's up here I believe he's in the spirit because I believe that God has has SP spoke with him and has revealed to him you know things that the church needs but when you're not open to that then it gets real hard you're like well I don't know what but he's on I don't know what he's taking because I don't feel that way I want to tell you something Brothers SS you don't know what you're missing you know when Caleb he went to the promised land oh he had some wine know he had he got he had grapes I believe that I believe Caleb drank some wine I believe that you don't have to oh because as soon as he got back to tell everybody he was ready to go back yeah let's go we got to go take what's ours you got to leave all that you got to leave Egypt behind you we got to go get what's ours and you know he was ready he was he was in the spirit he had CAU the Revelation he was ready to go back you see in this coming year we got to we got to catch that Revelation if you don't have it go get it you got to work for it you got to go get it and when you get it I'll be ready I'll be ready to go fight be ready to go get what is yours you got to leave everything in the past because something God has something more for you ahead see he's not done I'm closing know there's a lot of times especially you know in in in the circumstance of Simeon where you know it becomes it gets a little disappointing perhaps when you may not have received what you wanted may not have received perhaps your healing or Deliverance or your peace you know things of the past you know keep coming back and they haunt you you know because because that's what the devil wants he wants to he wants to haunt you he wants to torment you he wants you to think that there's nothing for you that it's all over everything is finished that you'll always be that way that he brought you this far only to be disappointed again year after year you may have been waiting for something but I believe that that last day that Simeon went into the temple when God showed him when God gave him in his hands what he had been waiting for his whole life I believe that it was worth it it was worth more than everybody laughing at him I don't think that Simeon could hear the people you don't believe that he could hear a mocking and laughing at him and letting him know he was crazy and letting him know that it was going to be nothing that God wasn't real but it was and he saw it he saw it with his own eyes you see Simon could have stayed in bed that day job H he could have stayed on the ground that day scratching his boils but he didn't I believe they got up and I tell you you may be fine trying to find comfort and all these other things you may be going through pain may not know how to get help but I can tell you one thing that Simeon didn't stay down that job didn't stay down and I believe that when Paul fell on his road to Damascus he didn't stay down and above all Jesus didn't stay down but he got up he rose up he rose up because he knew that one day he was going to see his seed he was going to see his seed I believe it and I take that for me it has to be personal it has to be something that God has to show you see the church the church ain't going to show you it has to be the Holy Ghost he'll show you the Bible says that he'll take you to all truth he'll guide you to all truth let us bow our heads to pray you please stand Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity you've given us Lord to be in your presence once again we ask that you just move and just help the people Lord continue to strengthen them Lord that they would just keep fighting Lord keep believing and just have for certain Lord that you're with us Lord that you've never forsake us they you'll be with us until the end of the world no matter what we're going through no matter our circumstances no matter our pain no matter our suffering no matter our mental state you are going to help us and we just ask Lord you just give the people Lord what they're asking Lord and they just continue walking Walking In Truth Lord and walking in light we put her in your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen get the into [Music] Pres [Music] do [Music] get [Music] [Music] through [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] for to [Music] yes [Applause] Lord oh for [Applause] me for to Glory Glory glor for [Music] Mee [Music] for oh to God be the glory to God Be That Glory to God be that GL oh to God be the glory for the things he has done his power Hallelujah he has save me with his Hallelujah he has raised me

amen [Music] sometimes we think if I were someone important in the temple Sim if Simeon was something temp sometimes we think s was someone important in the temple but he was not he wasn't a priest he was not a levite he wasn't someone who helped out in the temple he was simply a worshipper he was simply a worshipper went to the temple to worship God the temple to worship God he was simply a member but the Bible says he was just it was righteous and devout he was someone faithful he was someone who was faithful and I believe if we're only just faithful if we say Lord I don't feel like doing this for you right now but I will be faithful I will do what I came to do Lord I will do what you called me to do a worshipper I believe it's possible the Bible says that the temple the spirit moved the temple and I start to meditate that perhaps the devil was telling him him why do you keep going on why do you keep waiting why do you keep trying why do you keep waiting on God I believe the devil placed a lot of thoughts in his mind many stumbling blocks but I believe that day he said I will go and worship him anyways anyways thank you anyway to church like [Applause] that anys I'm G to worship Him I will worship him anyways I'll worship him anyways maybe that was his thought that day I worship him anyways tremendous amen all right okay I believe if we could only keep on waiting being faithful with God I'll keep on waiting say I'll keep on waiting tell your neighbor I'll keep on waiting but say it like you believe it I'll I'll keep on waiting you waiting on God I believe you're always waiting for something on God I believe there's no ending point you should always be waiting for something from God what else do you have what other blessings have I will keep on waiting we don't receive because we don't wait and we feel like God doesn't listen to us revive that calling inside of you Rive that inside of you I will keep on waiting maybe I got a little impatient maybe I got a little imp I will keep on waiting Church wanted to stop me for a while this night will keep on waiting wake your expectation up amen glory to God Brothers we should keep on waiting brother brother we should keep on waiting we should keep on waiting amen he was simply a worshipper it was simply a person he said I'll worship him anyways he hasn't answered me but I worship him anyways there so many hrit at the temple but I'll worship him there many theves at the temple but I'm going to go and worship him oh Brothers I don't believe he went to the temple so they can give him something he went to worship that's why he went to the temple not because there were good people there went to worship God that day I believe as while Mary and Joseph took the baby to present him I believe saw from far away and he said this one's it this is it this is it so common sometimes the Lord Works in so in so much so many common ways it could be a Wednesday Brothers and all of a sudden something inside you says I will keep on waiting amen amen glor hallelujah to God Amen God bless you we'll be being dismissed on Friday we'll have service and Sunday the 31st the service will be at 10:30 a.m. we'll only have one service in the morning and we have the New Year's Eve dinner at 5:30 and on we'll try to serve food at 6 then at 9: we'll start our service at 9900 p.m. to receive the year we have a few videos of the Year some specials some words and overall worship you come to worship Him Brothers Serv in the morning at 10:30 a.m. then dinner 5:30 and on then service again at 9:00 p.m. the fast will start on Monday when we wake up in the morning the first January 1st and we should give an effort I'll repeat it again many times it seems like our efforts don't produce much where where would we be where if we didn't put in the effort to do something for God God has been with us can you say that forcing you God has been with me this year amen amen has been with me this year so I believe it's because something for him and we put in the effort so then let's let us put in the effort as a church to come into this fast um spiritually mentally not only in food but in your spirit and soul the things you shouldn't be watching things that don't please the Holy Spirit maybe your social medias do something good for yourself for your soul for your [Music] spirit so we'll start that
