Applause to the Holy Ghost how beautiful it is to be in the presence of the Holy Spirit when he moves it's something that you don't want to get out of that atmosphere and that is what we are awaiting one day to be with him eternally nothing will hinder us there won't be time able to have fellowship with one another for eternity as you're standing I'm going to invite you to open your scriptures to Second Kings chapter 1 from verse 1 to verse three and Jeremiah 8:22 we're speaking with the theme getting closer to God we thank our pastor for the trust that he places in [Music] us we don't take it lightly it's a great responsibility what we will be speaking this uh morning the scripture says like this after ahab's death Moab rebelled against Israel and haah fell through the window of a room of the house that he had in Samaria and being sick he sent Messengers and said to them go and inquire of bbub God of Acron whether I am to be cured of this my illness then the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the tishbite saying arise and go up to meet the messenger of the king of Samaria and say unto them is there no God in Israel that you go to inquire of belzebub God of eon 8:22 says like this is there no bomb in Gilead isn't there a doctor there why then was there no medicine for the daughter of my people's pray Heavenly Father we put ourselves in your hands we put each person here in your hands that you would take control of us if there was something that would hinder us if we come troubled this morning to hear your word that we would set aside the problems of our daily lives because if we set those problems aside we will find the one that has the resolution to our problems and that is in your word Lord we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen uh you may be seated we're speaking on getting closer to God our pastor opened up the subject last week I don't know if you [Music] recall he uh named the title getting closer to him do do you recall brothers that he began to speak on Peter that Peter was a Christian only from a far off that's how our pastor begin to to talk so this morning I would like to focus on uh on the the way back there is a way that we can come back or return but before entering into that I would like to focus on a special point because from because that when you leave a place there was something that pulled you away from that place something happened in your life that pulled you away from the way of God I like what our pastor had said in the message closer to him he said this the Lord Jesus Christ had warned Peter the devil asked of you to to you or brother let me tell you the devil is going to come to shake you he's going to try to kill you the devil will always come he will try to find a way if you notice since the beginning the devil always tries to find way to pull you away from your lord there was Adam and Eve and he tried to separate catch this church the devil always tries to separate you because he knows that there is strength the devil tried to separate Adam from Eve found Eve in a weak moment in her life and he tried to separate the devil always tries to divide or separate we have to catch that this morning the Holy Spirit was speaking to me when the pastor was sharing this he was saying and and Peter pulled away something caused Peter to separate or pull away he began to pull away and and something that catches my attention is that Peter it says that Peter observed him from a far off it said he got to a place and he sat down to look at the end do you remember Peter was sitting there and you know he was a warming warming up then our pastor told how easy we we let go of what God has given us there was Peter he was comfortable he was warming up there amen amen and there are times in our lives the circumstances of our daily lives begin to separate us little by little and this morning I'm going to bring it very simple and sometimes the things that pull us away from the Lord is not understanding the great Mysteries that's not it the things that separate us from God I like what brother Garcia says here I'm going to read James 41 first it says where do Wars and disputes among you come from catch this church sometimes the things that separate from the Lord aren't aren't the the supernatural things the things that afflict us amongst us the disputes that we have amongst ourselves are the simple things and the simple things are the ones that separate us the the Small Things is the today and he works in the same manner but don't forget is the same today until he tries to use the same strategy tries to separate separate you from your brother separate you from your sister separ from the husb separ from the wife from from the son that is the work of the devil to try try to divide us divide a family try to divide us Brothers we are a family this is a family I refer to a family refering to and I'm talking about the world the body of Christ of the Lord Jesus Christ not just the for church composed of a body from throughout the world and the devil always tries to separate because he knows if he is able to divide one he has the edge and he can have a greater effect Wars and disputes among you come from is it not your passions which war in your members sometimes we think the great things will separate us from the Lord It's the small things as small as it may seem the devil enters with a lie with such a small thing and when you least expect it you are there in your bed with the remote control time for service I don't want to go to church ACH hyoc talk about me am I speaking to anybody this morning that's the strategy of the devil that is the way that the devil pulls us away from God says this in the message fundamental Foundation God had placed him to govern so that he would have dominion so that he would be a superior being to other beings he's speaking about Adam here so so that he would be a superior being to other beings but he fell he lost Consciousness listen church he forgot the Reason God had put him here it's say if you have a house and your drain is clogged all over your plumbing is clogged you're back up so it has happened to our brains and all our channels have been blocked with what they have been blocked with business matters with our daily with our home life are you catching this church it's not that we don't understand things of the Bible it's simple when Adam and Eve were there Elohim would come down and he fellow with them he had fellowship with he talked to him I don't know how long they would talk and then and then he would he would come uh look and and Adam could speak with God and there was a conversation but the devil entered and began to divide and how did he Enter he entered through sin and sin separates you from God sin will always separate you from God catch this church but God still loves The Sinner one thing is s and the other thing is The Sinner and the Lord will continue loving you despite how low you've got how low you are there in your life or your soul or your being even if you're sick of sin that doesn't matter to God he continues loving he is still waiting for you he is providing a way so that you can come back provides the way back that you can come back accept the provided Way by him God always has a way the problem is me accepting that way the word of God is not the problem the problem is me accept the way back now this message this precious message brought us back message came to restore all things it came to restore what had been lost in the beginning but why don't we see the the the the Wonders or Miracles one is because we are always in the in the flesh are very carnal [Applause] amen it's the truth how do we want to feel the spirit of God when we're in the flesh when we come we come through those doors we should come with a humble heart and a something from him he will always answer he will always answer he always fulfills his word so brother Garcia continues saying they have has been blocked with business matters the ways that God has so that he could speak to us they are blocked they're not blocked with something Supernatural super they are blocked with simple matters your your life there in your home how do you live in your home that's why your channels are blocked but God designed man in a perfect way now it says with the life of our home with dom it's so blocked until God can no longer operate through uh those channels brother BR says this in the message God provides a way aren't you happy for that that we can be in the dumps on the floor and we just we just you know throw in the towel per se but he always comes you could be in in the dumps since we are born we are we are born broken we are Tor to Pieces many of us have come from a from a you know a family where it's a broken home my family was was separated my my parents they they divorced they separated what hope did I have I begin to meditate on it and I say father thank you because by your grace and your love we are here thousands and thousands of miles separated from him God provides a way and we refuse it that is a sad thing that we don't want God's provided way God tells us do it this way son and I'll bring it even more it's easier than that it's not that an angel's going to come down and appear before you God has a plan on how he works okay okay so God has his his Shepherd or Pastor that he could counsel and let you know no you're not going to see a fleshly or carnal man because the fleshly man will will fail you but when you filter the thing and you see Beyond the Veil when you can see Beyond the Veil oh Brothers the blessings of God will be there the way God works that's way he provides for his people but we refuse it we don't want it we don't want the way of the Lord because perhaps it's not how I want it but by the grace of God along with the other youth leaders uh you know we work with the youth and we see that that that we let them know to do things a certain way and uh they they don't want it but that's fine I was a young man once too and I didn't put in both feet I put in all four of my feet I believe the Lord allowed me to go through certain things in my life so that I would be able to understand the youth not just the youth but be able to be able to understand my brother and sister and this morning I would like to speak on 20 minutes uh to speak on the thought that I I would like to share is that fine with you when we speak on the things of the Lord for many it may seem a little heavy but others really enjoy it because there's not a better place to be than to be hearing God's word we are privileged people the day will come the day will come where this will all shut down the day will come brother that's why you should Rejoice right now while you rejoice that God has provided let us rejoice I'm gonna be focusing on aiah aah was a king of Israel he was the son of Ahab and Jezebel remember the thought Brothers the way back God provides a way so that we can understand I'm going to give you a little bit a context this King remember his mother was Jezebel and his his father was Ahab Ahab was a king of Israel the scripture says that he was an Israelite the scripture says that he did contrary to God's will he went and married a pagan woman whose name was Jezebel now this this couple they they had a child the the scripture say that he had like 70 children Ahab had 70 children so amongst them was this King haah I would like to share what brother Brandon shared here in the way back and haaiah did the same thing he was like many of us today he was just very stubborn how many can identify with that it was brother Fidel and it's like he still wants to go back but but you know I I calm down but we're working Brothers there are many things that I don't like of myself I look at myself I'm like oh Lord help my wife because unfortunately well fortunately that's the best thing that God could give us that's that God could give me was my wife many times we we harm them how many can identify with that he was like many of us today he was just very stubborn he just didn't want to do it however he knew that Elijah was there in the desert I'm be speaking a little bit on this King this King had had had fallen his his mother says that he had he had a fall she fell that she had fallen dogs licked up her blood now her son he also fell he fell through a window so heill and he was on the verge of death and the scripture says that he got some of his servants he sent them and he sent them to the to the place of acon where there was an idol by the name of bbub how many recall who bbub is our Lord Jesus Christ that he was a belah they told the Lord Jesus Christ so this King sends his servants to to see if I will find Healing now this is the way when you are separated from God the way that we live many times when we're separated from God we want to seek an answer in the wrong place when you seek for an answer uh watch who you counsel with because it can help you or it could send you to hell so they sent the servants and there was Elijah on the mountain so the angel of the Lord appeared to Elijah and says Elijah arise and he began to share with him what King had been planning so Elijah appears to them to the servants the king had said and he said tell your Lord that he will not uh get up from this illness he will not get up from the bed catch this church because he is seeking counsel in the wrong place he will not get better they returned and the King asked the servants what had [Music] happened we saw a man that was that was like this like this describ and The King The King asked you know for a description had he had the sheep skins wrapped around and and notice when you know to do what's right and because of your stubbornness because I know all things I don't need the five-fold ministry I don't need the pastor that's okay I can do it okay that's fine so this fellow to describe how this man looked and they're like oh that's elij he said that's Elijah Elijah but due to his pride it's okay he said that's he he didn't want that way and he sent another group of 50 men and Elijah appeared before them as well they even told Elijah men of God we we want to speak to you said if I'm if if if I'm a Ser of the Lord may may may lightning come from Heaven and the the 50 they they died that right didn't there and they they they they died and notice because they were trying to seek counsel in a way in a place we also affect a second and third parties due to our decisions and he sent another Army of men and what what do you think happened the same thing he told them he let them know this is tremendous they did not they didn't present themselves in a bad way but Elijah but he said okay that the king wanted to see him again and lightning come down from or fire came down from heaven and consumed these men as well notice catch this the attitude is very important so he sends another group of men another another 50 but what do you think this man did he went and he kned before him my Lord he said 50 after 50 and the fire had consumed them before this man arrived but he this man said have mercy upon me amen have mercy upon me and of the men that come with me and he told the Lord he said he said go Elijah told him to go because they will not harm you I told Elijah it it matters how you approach God Elijah was coming and he said he said he told him that he would not get up from the illness because you counseled with other Gods Not bombing Gilead why do we counsel other people why do we counsel with other people he he would he said is God the god of Israel not amongst the people of Israel God always has somebody to guide his people always the person is always stubborn and they seek what they desire and when they're in the very thck of the problem start calling the pastor right away and here comes the grace and here comes Grace our pastor not going to come well he hasn't done that to me but the Grace will be extended at that point that's why many times the children of God are criticized because they show Grace because the people have not understood that God that was in the heavens cre the heavens and the Earth he came and became a human fles in a man named Jesus he came and said I will not leave you comforta I will send the Holy Spirit you and he came in a man he doesn't come through Angels he comes in a man in human form in human flesh how many are rejoicing with the word we're closing now it doesn't matter what we have done Brothers there is a way back I'm going to tell you the provided way those that have been lost those of us that have been lost and we have been forgiven for much Lord we all love much it says look I'm going to tell you the way to get back if you want to return you must get inoculated what is that word inoculated in other words it's to become immune to get a vaccine you must administer the balm of God the serum of God he has it it's a double cure for sin the blood of Jesus Christ the son of God the baptism of the Holy Spirit he cleanses from sin and fills them for service aren't you happy for the Holy Spirit brothers that Holy Spirit where you come and the Holy Spirit fills you he come and anoint and he puts you into action I don't the spirit if you if you're doubting you don't have it you have it you're like oh the doors of the church have opened I'm going to run into them when there's something to do there has to be something burning in your heart puts you into action service the Holy Spirit activates it doesn't let you stay still that's why when Paul when Paul met the pillar of fire he was a religious man catched his church when the Holy Spirit came opened the first Doctrine he didn't open it with the sinners catch this when he came and said you have you must be born again he came and brought it to a religious person he didn't bring it to the Sinners he brought it to the religious people to Nicodemus so that you would be able to understand the kingdom of God so that you can understand or see you have to be born again there has to be a death there has to be a massacre not in this fleshly body but in your desires you have to begin to kill kill those thoughts that come to you want to separate you from God you have to start killing yourself not the mirror and see all your bad things you don't want to go to church you start killing yourself start killing your your own desires you're own I want to do this say I no longer chis live but Christ liveth in me but many are still still living because it's when it's no longer you living these uh hands become his hands this becomes his mouth but why do we curse and things of this nature because this is not his mouth there has to be a a a a killing and remember the the the killing Begins the sacrifice begins here at the altar if you want to return this morning there is bomb in Gilead when I say there's bomb in Gilead I am letting you know that there is medicine anything that is happening in our lives any problem or sickness or whatever it may be brothers the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ it takes away every stain but the most important thing here is you that you would accept that you would say yes Lord I am a sinner that's the first thing we have to do that's why the Lord told Nicodemus because Nicodemus thought he was the last Coca-Cola in the desert and when we're we spend a lot of time in church we we we we think we're something special but many are here in the church and have the message but the message has in you in me in me that's the way there's a way back and that is the way back why don't you stand and give the Holy Spirit a Round of Applause Just say [Applause] Lord tell him this morning look Brothers I am not ashamed I'm not ashamed to speak of the Lord I'd rather be ashamed here than over there and say Lord I messed up I I pulled away I pulled away but today today is the day Lord that you've opened the doors so that I could make my way back again and Peter on the day of Pentecost he said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit that is that is the way that's the way back repent but from your heart say God I'm not going to do it anymore forgive me I've messed up with a contrite and humble heart and he he will see your heart he saw the heart of aiah he saw his heart you truly come with that surrendered heart he will hear you let us pray heavenly father father I remember when you found [Music] me there in the nightclub you said Son you are not from this place come back home there's a way [Music] back we if we could make our have this heart turn from a stone to to to one of Flesh and kill that Pride that is in me Lord help me let go of all things if there is amongst us people that are harmed or hurt that have been influenced even by their fathers in a bad way par just like aiah was influenced by his mother that you would allow us to let go of all those that make our lives bitter that you would come and bring that bomb if we just allow and accept you in our hearts and allow you to enter into the deepest part of of our beings and say God do as you please behold your [Music] servant do as you please father we put each

stand and greet everyone [Applause] here we're we're following the spirit of the pastor up to now God has placed us here so this will be our home we've been praying again for about four years for this to be possible we had to do many things for that God to line us up and prepare us here now we ask God that we may be of help for you guys as well because we don't want to be a burden for you so if anything we can help let us know my name isit everyone calls me Po in Italian it means protector ofes I translated and said uh horse means power I always explain my name in fullness because many people don't understand it I'm an I'm a junior she's like I don't like the name but it's the best inheritance I can give you can you give me something else cuz I don't like that don't worry there's a church in the city of Mexico that takes your name that has your name but I give thanks to God that I'm in this message and not in that church God bless you Brothers once again we hope to be of help for you guys I'm asking to step forward and see some greetings God bless you Brothers Pastor asked me to greet you guys in this morning best way I can GRE you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Phoenix Phoenix we send greetings from Phoenix Arizona from Phoenix Tabernacle J our brother Junior re is the one in charge for the moment we need a lot of your prayers so that the Lord can place us put and place Us in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and that way we can function at 100% they send greetings to to our pastor brother to your congregation on Tuesday if God allows we'll be returning home if I can say just this little bit the first time I came here there's something special here I've never experienced such great love when my wife and I came for the first time we live very happy because of certain circumstances we came to this place my brother-in Throne of God everything has a purpose that was the motive and the reason why we came to for cins but we live very happy and we felt that great love God bless you Brothers let us continue praying for each other we need of you we need for you to pray for us and we shall pray for you as well if I say something in particular I am a witness of what God is doing now in these times sometimes we don't see it we're focusing in the past and what God has done or what God is going to do but sometimes we we let it passes by what he's doing now in this moment I'm a witness of a restored matrimony marriage a restored marriage and I will not be silenced from now on forward till God allows me to be here on this Earth I will testify of what God does from nothing he raises us he lifts us up and there's a way to return back the message God has provided a way I found the way back Brothers if I can express myself a little bit what is the reaction of when someone wins the lottery what would be your reaction would you be sad I million and let's see what happens no no I feel more happier than having won the because He restored my life the preaching of our pastor this morning spoke of Lazarus I took it personally I was dead four years I was dead I heard his voice when I came out of that tomb no one wanted to talk to me you know why because I smelled know when Lazarus came out he smelled and then he came out all bound I came all bounds and when I came to four Callins those they were unwrapping me I was experiencing Divine love here in this place my wife is a witness that you have given me so much love if you allow me there's a quote I want to I have in my you give me a second and as the days get closer and closer by my sight is failing me and the road becomes more narrow we we want to walk more together so we should become one one body we should move together forgetting forgetting each other's sins and our differences getting us closer and closer to such a point we're getting closer to that day Gathering all unanimously and from one heart and if one brother or one sister deviates from the road do not criticize him whichever way we don't do anything but pray for that person in love always considering each other never allow that one of you guys departer away stay together and if you can add more to it constantly all the time I believe it with all my heart the time is drying n everything is going to come to an end our pastor was talking about tears I believe we've all shed tears of sadness of pain I've been dis disappointed many people and even then uh the Lord took away my shame without him I am nothing and because of him I am here I see eye to eye face to face before I couldn't do that but that day on Calvary he took my place the Bible says he and he gave us everything with one of the things of the money he gave us was his forgiveness our salvation and eternal life keeping on in English it says those are the words that said to brother Bram God bless you let's continue praying brothers and we're happy to be [Applause] here before leaving going to ask one more person our
