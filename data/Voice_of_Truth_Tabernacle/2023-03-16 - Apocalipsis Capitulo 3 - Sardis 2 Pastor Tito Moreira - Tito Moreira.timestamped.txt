[14:27] something that our souls need to hear

[21:23] you may be seated
[21:31] for entering into this artist's age once
[21:34] again
[21:35] um
[21:36] [Music]
[21:40] to give a small tribute to our sister
[21:43] Margarita okay
[21:46] God called her home to be with him
[21:49] yesterday
[21:51] she was with us here first time
[21:55] so we consider a part of this
[21:57] congregation
[21:59] and we are we're happy
[22:01] for the life that she lived
[22:04] and the example she gave is
[22:11] I believe it also goes with what we are
[22:13] speaking
[22:15] about the patience the
[22:19] and then there like well understanding
[22:24] the the stage that we are in desperate
[22:29] to go wake up to the moment that we're
[22:31] living in
[22:34] sometimes we're so occupied
[22:37] in doing things that we don't we don't
[22:42] detain ourselves we don't stop we don't
[22:45] stop
[22:46] to think
[22:49] what we're if we're doing really matters
[22:53] our mind is so occupied doing things
[22:58] that if we don't stop
[23:01] and analyze our lives
[23:04] and we asked and all this is
[23:10] am I truly doing what really matters
[23:13] because if not one day we will realize
[23:18] we might have
[23:21] that
[23:23] it was not worth it
[23:28] I believe it's important to uh stop and
[23:32] open eyes
[23:37] listen he hasn't even listened to what
[23:39] the spirit says
[23:50] for the time that we're living
[23:53] and ask Lord
[24:02] paying attention
[24:05] to what you want me to do Anton says
[24:10] then I I want to pay attention
[24:13] I want to listen to what God is saying
[24:19] and I've got sentenced this this lady
[24:22] and God wanted to take her
[24:27] part of our Lives
[24:30] I want to pay attention I want to stop
[24:33] [Music]
[24:35] I don't want to just let this go by
[24:38] and think oh I have other things to do
[24:42] but be alert to what God is doing and
[24:45] speaking
[24:53] to come forward
[24:55] and speak some words of sister Margarita
[24:58] is
[25:01] and we thank God for her life
[25:06] to meet her afterwards
[25:23] has been here God bless you
[25:29] I said I was not gonna cry but
[25:32] the good thing is I'm here in at home
[25:36] yeah you know me
[25:41] it's very difficult
[25:46] um
[25:47] partir to uh to partner
[25:53] to see someone leave that you love
[25:57] me you know
[26:00] if I believe in God right now it's
[26:05] because I had God in my home
[26:08] I had him in my mouth
[26:11] in my home I would I would speak with
[26:13] him
[26:30] in simplicity
[26:33] is
[26:41] left or she died
[26:47] because of a short time of Separation
[26:52] The God decided to take away my mother
[26:57] 's grandmother
[27:06] with her
[27:19] in one way or another you treated her
[27:21] well
[27:26] we go to the barbershop we'd go together
[27:30] is
[27:36] you would share stories with me
[27:44] I just share this
[27:47] is
[27:50] so you just know the caliber of of women
[27:53] that you were speaking of is
[27:56] this happened in 1997.
[28:00] when my father passed away
[28:03] I remember I don't know
[28:06] a hurricane
[28:10] they were difficult times
[28:14] for for me as a person
[28:17] since my father passed away
[28:22] I remember it was very cloudy it was a
[28:25] hurricane many people passed away
[28:29] and one of the things that impacted me
[28:32] of my my grandmother is
[28:34] this that I will share with you
[28:37] she suffered very much
[28:43] by her husband
[28:46] in many ways
[28:51] she was mistreated yeah
[28:58] her husband had a
[29:01] a
[29:04] lovers in the same around the same place
[29:08] where she lived
[29:31] a little bit higher than that
[29:37] my grandmother or my grandmother would
[29:40] see my my grandfather just go bye
[29:44] she would see him go by with with his
[29:46] lover
[29:50] that's what she was very saying
[29:57] who wouldn't right
[30:00] [Music]
[30:02] but one of the things that impacted
[30:06] when my father passed away I remember
[30:12] we're going up a little higher where my
[30:14] father lived up in the area where we
[30:16] lived
[30:21] Persona and my grandmother and I even
[30:24] most famous
[30:28] [Music]
[30:30] and where the hurricane went through and
[30:32] everything is
[30:35] a lot of water going through the street
[30:42] the water was very strong and I remember
[30:46] as if it was yesterday
[30:50] I was a very young
[30:57] a person was coming toward us
[31:01] and it was the mother of our brother
[31:03] adelpho
[31:05] yeah I remember
[31:10] that she approaches I remember
[31:18] a lot due to that
[31:22] and that lady approached my grandma
[31:24] and my grandmother approached her and I
[31:28] remember
[31:29] my uh my grandmother asked her for
[31:32] forgiveness
[31:57] that has been mistreated
[31:59] is
[32:32] [Music]
[33:06] I want to thank everybody
[33:11] and God is real brothers

[34:25] for giving me the opportunity
[34:28] the great privilege and honor
[34:32] they were
[34:35] doing to be able to be raised in a home
[34:39] of a daughter of God
[34:43] when you are happy with being
[34:46] familiarika raised in a rich family oh
[34:49] he says hi Jose
[34:52] or maybe uh Sons or Daughters of a king
[34:59] I'm happy to have been raised there
[35:02] where a son and daughter of God was
[35:05] I want to thank my lord for that
[35:09] I think the people that
[35:15] a smile
[35:19] a hug
[35:22] words of encouragement for her
[35:25] when she was here with us
[35:28] um
[35:30] to thank you for that
[35:32] um
[35:35] we're very close to her you know yes
[35:39] one of them was our sisters
[35:53] grandmother would be okay
[35:57] they gave her a thanks or a birthday
[35:59] gift
[36:00] she wanted to go to Disneyland
[36:05] my uh my wife she took the time and took
[36:08] her to Disneyland
[36:10] and I want to thank you for what you did
[36:13] for her
[36:18] I'd like to read a scripture are you an
[36:21] apocalypses in the Book of Revelation
[36:24] 21 verse 4.
[36:27] the scripture says like this
[36:35] foreign
[36:47] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[36:50] their eyes and there shall be no more
[36:51] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[36:53] shall there be any more pain for the
[36:55] former things are passed away
[36:57] um
[36:59] my grandmother margarita
[37:02] Corazon she had a great heart
[37:37] she
[37:41] loved us
[37:52] to take care of her children
[37:57] not only did she adopt us
[38:00] but my brothers
[38:03] but her heart was greater than that in
[38:07] one day
[38:10] a little girl
[38:14] I remember a little a little girl a
[38:17] little baby foreign
[38:25] and she loved her
[38:32] it's our uh our sister Rocio
[38:37] she had such a great heart
[38:41] okay
[38:42] foreign
[38:50] I remember we made her at home
[38:55] it was a little like a tit per se
[38:58] Elizabeth
[38:59] I had a had an aluminum roof
[39:03] she asked me to do that
[39:07] and she wanted to sell in in that place
[39:13] to sell eggs
[39:16] in order that she could raise us
[39:35] that's why she didn't prosper in
[39:37] business
[39:38] she was a great woman
[39:46] her last days
[39:50] the ones that were around her
[39:55] they were able to see the angel of the
[39:58] Lord
[39:59] before her
[40:04] and that confirms
[40:09] she was a daughter of God
[40:12] when she was asked
[40:15] she was ready to go with the Lord
[40:18] so it's not a single doubt in her heart
[40:21] she said I'm ready
[40:25] foreign
[40:40] she was a great example for me
[40:44] um
[40:45] as my brother said
[40:49] if we are here today
[40:52] is
[40:55] because one day a woman like her stood
[40:57] up for God
[41:00] and as Paul told Timothy
[41:03] circus
[41:06] as I saw of faith in that woman that was
[41:10] not that was not a
[41:13] fake
[41:17] and and that woman was that type of
[41:20] thing either of faith that was not uh
[41:23] may the Lord bless you
[41:27] [Applause]
[41:35] do we give our uh
[41:38] [Applause]
[41:48] the Bible says we have a great cloud of
[41:50] witnesses that encourages
[41:55] keep going it can be done
[41:59] why could you are going to be able to as
[42:01] well
[42:07] continue fighting the good fight and
[42:10] finish the race
[42:11] almost uh
[42:14] just change it up a little bit
[42:19] we're going to enter into the Sardis
[42:22] Church
[42:23] Revelation 3 1 once again
[42:28] we're in the fifth Church
[42:30] the fifth Church
[42:34] the age of Sardis
[42:38] the time of the Reformation
[42:42] at the time of Martin Luther
[42:45] where the Protestants were born
[42:49] and the seed that was founded by this
[42:52] nation
[42:54] that this nation created
[42:57] that created this that created this
[42:59] nation
[43:01] is
[43:10] and unto the angel of the church and
[43:12] Sardis right these things said he the
[43:15] the hath the seven spirits of God
[43:20] um
[43:26] I want to focus on the seven Messengers
[43:29] in the seven spirits this evening
[43:31] the random tells us
[43:35] seven spirits
[43:39] speak to us of seven men
[43:43] you see them in Revelation 1.
[43:52] there's the seven angels to the seven
[43:54] churches
[44:21] this is very evident that the word they
[44:24] refers to men
[44:25] uh
[44:31] Associated spiritus those seven spirits
[44:34] and Seven Stars I want you to notice
[44:38] this is
[44:46] two attributes
[44:50] but also tells us in the stars
[44:54] the Bible also also mentions them as
[44:57] seven eyes
[45:04] it only mentions two things of them
[45:08] spirits
[45:10] and the Seven Stars
[45:12] but they're also seven eyes
[45:15] and also seven lips
[45:21] it is very evident the word they refers
[45:24] to Men
[45:28] of course there will be anointed
[45:35] for God's Ministries are not in the
[45:37] power of men
[45:40] synonyms
[45:53] it is evident that the seven spirits of
[45:55] God refer to the continuous Ministry of
[45:57] the same Holy Spirit in the lives of
[45:58] seven men
[46:01] in other words it's only one Holy Ghost
[46:04] but in seven minutes
[46:07] there's seven manifestations
[46:10] they're not seven different spirits
[46:14] but seven different anointed
[46:17] or commissions
[46:25] you can read it again it is evident that
[46:28] the seven spirits of God refer to the
[46:30] continuous Ministry of the similar
[46:31] spirit in the lives of seven men they
[46:33] say
[46:37] s
[46:41] with whom God identifies himself very
[46:43] closely
[46:45] God identifies himself with them
[46:48] God has identified himself with those
[46:51] seven spirits
[46:53] they are his eyes they are his lamps
[47:03] because the next phrase causes the Seven
[47:06] Stars
[47:09] which are already known to us as the
[47:11] seven Messengers
[47:15] in chapter one that those the Seven
[47:18] Stars are the seven angels
[47:21] so just review that chapter later
[47:27] is
[47:31] the star was meant to reflect light at
[47:35] night for the Sun
[47:49] they all did this through the holy
[47:52] ghosts
[47:58] so we see that the seven spirits
[48:00] actually referred to the one spirit of
[48:02] God
[48:06] working out the will and word of God in
[48:08] different Generations
[48:15] I would like to take the moment
[48:20] to see why God mentions them in this age
[48:25] well he brings This to Memory in this
[48:27] song what does it have to do
[48:30] what's the status
[48:35] yes because we're studying the virtue of
[48:37] patience
[48:41] that God has an anointing for each other
[48:43] in other words
[48:47] God gives each age what they need for
[48:50] that age
[48:53] of Ephesus
[48:57] for the spirit church
[49:12] God knows
[49:20] God knows we'll go through different
[49:22] stages in our lives
[49:35] in the spiritual churches they didn't
[49:37] need a poem
[49:38] in Iranians
[49:48] with each and every one of us needs yes
[50:18] God knows what I need
[50:22] no
[51:21] today
[51:39] is
[51:43] higher things than what even the message
[52:14] back to the original word of God
[52:22] in the time of Luther
[52:25] is
[52:26] if you would have been in the time of
[52:28] Luther you stayed around and you were
[52:31] one of them okay that said
[52:35] so I want to know all the Mysteries
[52:40] I want to know the Book of Revelations
[52:46] but something preached at something
[52:48] higher something something stronger
[52:50] usted
[52:51] you would have put a Luther aside
[52:57] what else a simple message
[53:01] he's the messenger of all this church
[53:09] isn't that what we do many times
[53:14] in a very simple message
[53:18] that wasn't for me yes
[53:22] somebody eat something else
[54:22] the God is not in Rush
[54:33] before I can give you more
[54:38] the seven Messengers
[54:42] they did not give the same thing
[54:45] it doesn't mean it was the same Holy
[54:47] Ghost

[1:01:11] following the star
[1:01:14] s
[1:01:15] I'm following my own thoughts
[1:01:18] my own desires my own preachers
[1:01:23] so tell me things I want to hear
[1:01:26] the big churches
[1:01:32] and then they do uh their studies
[1:01:41] Suave you like a preacher that speaks
[1:01:43] softly
[1:01:48] to give people questionnaires
[1:01:57] to make the church brighter
[1:02:02] do you like when they greet you when you
[1:02:04] go in or else
[1:02:07] when someone funds the church
[1:02:12] according to what the people around
[1:02:34] Jesus Christ
[1:02:38] [Applause]
[1:02:51] they would show me a living Christ
[1:02:55] [Music]
[1:02:57] o who cares if it's a Luther
[1:03:01] an
[1:03:03] that's what I need
[1:03:05] if God sent me a loose
[1:03:13] maybe that's what I need
[1:03:22] it
[1:03:23] that's what many of us need
[1:03:28] stop thinking about so much Mysteries
[1:03:31] thinking about where your life is
[1:03:40] and realize that you have a lot to go
[1:03:43] you have no more time
[1:03:46] and then you better yes
[1:03:50] because if not you won't arrive over
[1:03:52] there
[1:04:10] to the churches
[1:04:30] out there
[1:04:38] what does he say God says
[1:04:44] what you need now
[1:04:46] today today
[1:04:56] John 16 12 says
[1:05:00] John 16 12.
[1:05:06] I have yet many things to say unto you
[1:05:08] said the Lord Jesus
[1:05:10] but you cannot bear them now
[1:05:18] this is
[1:05:22] you just had more to give them
[1:05:25] but it wasn't uh
[1:05:29] because it wasn't that right time
[1:05:33] they couldn't they couldn't take them in
[1:05:37] Mysteries
[1:05:43] we haven't even arrived to justification
[1:05:46] many times
[1:06:04] matured yet
[1:06:16] then I can give you a little bit more
[1:06:29] the prophet continues saying
[1:06:32] the last paragraph
[1:06:34] this is
[1:06:42] the same Lord identified himself with
[1:06:44] men in the Incarnation
[1:06:47] is
[1:06:49] again identifying himself with the man
[1:06:51] by his Spirit within him man
[1:06:54] speaking of these seven spirits
[1:06:59] El Senor
[1:07:02] es
[1:07:04] the seven spirits filled Spirit-filled
[1:07:07] Messengers are the Lord
[1:07:08] they may be repudiated
[1:07:11] questions
[1:07:17] lead to human minds they may not even
[1:07:19] seem to qualify
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:23] respective nevertheless they are The
[1:07:25] Messengers for their age God used in
[1:07:28] Abraham
[1:07:29] says use the Moses
[1:07:39] he murdered that's
[1:08:41] Jesus Christ he also saw that so God use
[1:08:43] that location
[1:08:51] s
[1:08:54] who cares if Martin Luther baptized in
[1:08:56] the name of the didn't baptize in the
[1:08:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:00] you didn't need
[1:09:03] that at the moment
[1:09:09] that's not what the people needed
[1:09:13] it's not what they needed
[1:09:20] so as we get upset here at church
[1:09:26] it's preaching too simple um
[1:09:33] some get upset because of that
[1:09:39] and they say oh brother he's angry
[1:09:47] maybe that's what you need
[1:09:50] don't complain
[1:09:55] is
[1:09:57] errors yes
[1:10:00] I never told you I was perfect
[1:10:03] I didn't put myself God placed me here I
[1:10:08] didn't put you here
[1:10:13] I didn't put you here
[1:10:16] I'm not begging you to stay here
[1:10:23] that God has to the churches
[1:10:31] more perfect
[1:11:03] with God
[1:11:07] amen hallelujah
[1:11:11] glory to God
[1:11:17] that's what patience is about
[1:11:21] the God has me here for a purpose
[1:11:26] as for me at the moment is
[1:11:30] to pay attention
[1:11:33] so what God wants to tell me today
[1:11:37] no he's going to tell me tomorrow
[1:11:51] me today
[1:11:54] the service will be what you make of it
[1:11:56] yes Brothers
[1:12:26] sometimes God won't move the mountain
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:01] what I'm telling you
[1:13:13] sometimes the only way
[1:13:17] it's mine of yours
[1:13:26] sometimes the only way
[1:13:38] it's time
[1:13:41] to shorten our trials
[1:13:44] as they listen our trials
[1:13:48] insurance is
[1:13:51] to lengthen our patients
[1:13:56] sometimes the only way
[1:13:59] shorten our trials is
[1:14:02] to lengthen our patients
[1:14:08] La Manera
[1:14:11] sometimes the way to lengthen our trials
[1:14:15] is
[1:14:16] to shorten our patients
[1:14:20] the shorter our patients
[1:14:22] the longer our trials
[1:14:27] because God says you're not paying
[1:14:29] attention
[1:14:31] you are in a hurry
[1:14:35] you're ready to go to another state
[1:14:39] I could take the trailer way
[1:14:45] because you're not paying attention
[1:14:50] the musicians can't come forward
[1:15:03] numbers 21 4 says
[1:15:13] and they journeyed from Mount hore by
[1:15:15] the way of the Red Sea to Encompass the
[1:15:18] land of Adam and the soul of people was
[1:15:20] much discouraged because of the way yeah
[1:15:23] and as people speak against God
[1:15:29] wherefore have you brought us up out of
[1:15:32] Egypt to die in the wilderness
[1:15:34] but there is no
[1:15:39] breadth of this light bread
[1:15:43] God wanted them to eat light bread and
[1:15:47] they didn't want it
[1:16:10] what's behind that voice
[1:16:40] just shall live by faith
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:59] shall live by faith
[1:17:03] but there was enough power there
[1:17:07] so anybody that received that message
[1:17:10] would be in the rapture
[1:17:38] and go in the rapture
[1:17:47] how tremendous is our God
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:53] if you would please stand
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:58] they say he says
[1:18:01] when they became impatient
[1:18:04] and they complained about that like this
[1:18:08] the Bible says the Lord sent them fiery
[1:18:11] serpents
[1:18:12] serpientes
[1:18:20] and most people of Israel died
[1:18:23] foreign
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:39] [Music]
[1:18:49] [Music]
[1:18:52] thank you
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:56] they complained they became impatient
[1:18:58] and God said you know what
[1:19:01] is
[1:19:02] it so you can have something to complain
[1:19:04] about
[1:19:06] I'm going to send you some serpents
[1:19:10] you don't want to give you uh you
[1:19:12] receive what I want I want to give you
[1:19:15] um
[1:19:16] you don't want the man that I sent you
[1:19:20] yeah
[1:19:22] I will send you some serpent sip
[1:19:29] because you want to hear
[1:19:34] you
[1:19:35] I don't want what I want you can look I
[1:19:39] want what he wants
[1:19:41] the power of the Holy
[1:19:43] ghosts
[1:19:46] may be
[1:19:48] that what he wants from my life
[1:20:07] stay still
[1:20:10] yes
[1:20:11] wait on God
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:20] sometimes that's the hardest thing it's
[1:20:22] classic kid is to stay still
[1:20:26] when it appears like God's not doing
[1:20:28] anything
[1:20:30] it seems like it's the most difficult
[1:20:31] thing is to wait on him
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:38] but believe me
[1:20:42] you are being changed
[1:20:45] the Bible says that the patience
[1:20:47] produces Perfection of our faith
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:56] I don't know what stage you're in
[1:21:00] but one thing I do know is
[1:21:05] that God is trying to speak to you and
[1:21:07] tell you something
[1:21:09] don't think that he stops speaking
[1:21:13] so then he stops doing
[1:21:21] but he's trying to do something right
[1:21:23] where you're at
[1:21:24] maybe it's not what you want but it's
[1:21:28] what you need
[1:21:30] and the best thing we can do
[1:21:54] something that you want to speak to me
[1:21:56] let's see
[1:21:57] tell me Lord
[1:22:00] oh Lord
[1:22:04] help our church
[1:22:06] help me Lord
