there in Las Cruses New Mexico very happy to be here with my wife and and with uh many of the Saints from Las Cruses also amen I told Brother Titus there's no other place in the world I would rather be right now than with you but uh before we get started you may be seated I just want to acknowledge brother Titus and and some of his men they've traveled with us to Uganda three or four times and they along with the church here have been part of the Great Revival that God that that that God has started there in Uganda and so as brother brother Bernie junr was was saying yesterday nothing better than to bring evidence amen so some of you maybe can't go to Uganda so we brought Uganda to you I'm gonna ask if uh where's he I'm gonna ask if brother we call him brother King Jeffrey I just call him my son King Jeffrey he is he is the son of many of you knew brother King John went on to be with the Lord but this is his son I'm gonna ask if he would greet you this this morning God bless you God bless you it's an honor for me to be here it's an amazing day to be alive I'm glad to be here with my papa pastor and the entire family I'm part of you guys whether you want it or not I'm here to stay I may be in Uganda but I'm part of this family I'm part of you all and uh I'm so blessed to see this today I know my plan was to go back earlier but my father told me we have to come and like in Uganda when a king says something it becomes a command and because my father is a father to the King when he says when he requests something it's better you here so when he told me that I'm supposed to be here with you all I was like yeah I can stay Pastor I'm so grateful Papa this man has really played a very big role in my life through support through encouragement but above all he has been a prayer intercessor in my life my life when I was becoming King when I was being appointed King I was a little bit young boy when I was being appointed yes I'm old in age but then there are things that I didn't know how to go about them but then God sent me Pastor KH he has been a role model in my life he actually accepted me into the family my name is nowz so it's okay for you to call me that name I'm so grateful for for the entire church back in Las crues and then this church too I know I've met Pastor Tito for some time he has been coming to Uganda he became a friend as well and a brother I'm grateful to this church too because from 2018 when I get when I got to know about the brothers my father used to come to this place too and I met some of you guys and like yes we loved your father and because we loved your father we love you too thank you for the love we appreciate you the work is still going on back in Uganda and thank you for continuing to pray with us it has not been easy since our father went back to be with the Lord has not been easy but through your prayers we are carrying on through your prayers we are surviving your prayers we are pushing on that you continue to pray with us because that's the best thing that we need it may not be finances but we need the prayer because God answers prayers so whatever you pray we know God is going to hear and he's going going to answer thank you for receiving me too like I said I may be going back home but I'm part of you all much love and may God bless [Applause] you amen God bless brother King Jeffrey Jeffrey if you feel sometimes that you got a lot a lot of load just uh remember King Jeffrey Jeffrey he's got only four million people to take care of only four million oh I got so much burdens brother amen God gives us not more than what we can handle amen I was asked a question the other day and I didn't know how to answer it I was stumped the question was when did you first meet brother Titus I couldn't for the life of me think I don't know I asked my brother Tom and he said Tommy I don't know finally we asked uh a younger brother will and finally he we got an answer I was like I I don't remember when I first met [Music] him it's like I've always known known brother Titus I knew him from before the foundation of the world and so I was like when God brought us together he joined us at the hip and uh and I tell you it's it has been an honor it's been an honor to to uh be able to say brother Titus you're is one of our our greatest friends that God gave us in this life [Applause] [Applause] not not only him his wife and family and the congregation here they are very dear to us we stand here with them to partak in their Joy so I had to tell one of of the brothers back there this is not your church this is our church amen amen so I want to commend him brother Titus in the congregation ex excellent job they have done preparing the the building for the dedic ation services but I commend them more on the work that they are doing both here and abroad we know much blood and sweat and tears goes into working but now God has given them their place their own place place of worship to gather and to worship and to preach the gospel here may God continue to bless them amen amen I just want to say we don't live in the alley no more Oh no you're not excited I'm going to say it again we don't live in the alley no more H now brother brandham says that is that right he said we don't live in the alley brother Bram says we're not a bunch of trash he says we've come out of the alley he said we're not in a shed no more we have now come to Hallelujah Boulevard you stand to your feet all right now now we got to remember that as we as we began this message message once again we're not in a shed no more we are on hallelu Boulevard and so we want to put a title to this message the Temple of the Dynamics we're here to dedicate a temple right but the greatest Temple is the Temple of the Dynamics for speech spee speech amen amen so the Temple of the Dynamics am I talking to anyone here no well you all act like you're afraid like it's your first day in church did we come to have a good time all right well maybe maybe you don't like your neighbor to much maybe you got to turn around and shake your neighbor's hand neighbor good to see you okay maybe you need to stretch a little bit let me tell you something when Solomon was dedicating the temple uhuh nuh we got a couple that are happy said all the congregation all the musicians all worship together as one man so I want to make sure that you're ready for dedication so how many are happy how many are the Temple of the Dynamics it seems like we have a bunch of temples of the mechanics but it's time that we bring in the Dynamics because we are the temple brother Bram says of the Dynamics 1 Chronicles if you can be so kind 1 Chronicles 29 1-3 we'll probably just read uh one and two when you have it you can say amen God bless those that are on hookup God bless all the ministry that is here certainly good to see each one of you furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation Solomon my son whom alone God hath chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the Lord God now I have prepared with all my might for the house of God of my God the gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of silver the brass for things of brass the iron for things of iron and wood for things of wood onx stones and stones to be set glister ing stones and of diverse colors and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance AB may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated what a desire that David had I remember when we first went to Los Cruses it was the thing that was that weighed so heavy upon me that we would have a place of worship now I remember the joys when we were able able to build the church finally have our own place my the joy as brother Titus was telling me I could I could hear the hear the joy in his voice but I I could feel it more than just hear it and so the desire that David had for the Ark of the Lord the desire to build a temple as we go back and just for a few moments I just want to I want to talk just a little bit about that Temple we know that David was not permitted to build it because of all the blood that was shed during his lifetime but as the Lord told him your son would would build the temple and and through the process of all this you know there was a woman that heard a about uh this this great man this great king named Solomon everybody knows she was uh Queen the Queen of Sheba right and she brought a a lot of gold you know sometimes we think about the queen that she brought just a little bag of gold said here you go Solomon good job no no the Bible says it was a very great train very much gold and precious stones the Bible tells us that it was about 120 talents which if you figure it out in today's worth she only brought him about $225 Million worth of gold tell your neighbor neighbor 225 million that's a lot that's a lot 2 and so David had assembled a lot of gold and silver the Bible says that it was a 100,000 talents of gold that was going to be put into the into the temple would equal about 200 billion dollar worth of gold and a million talents of silver which is almost around 23 billion billion dollar and all together there was this is not including anything else just the gold and the [Music] silver it would have been almost around 225 billion dollars worth of silver and gold they said they they estimate King Solomon's value or his worth today his net worth would be about $2.1 trillion you talk about being blessed it was a wonderful time for Israel and yet brother Brandon preaches the message a greater than Solomon is [Music] here I think that that's many times where where we have a disconnect I don't think we understand really really what our value what our worth is and because we don't understand that we we just go along with the flow brother Braham says we live a million miles under our god-given privileges years later as we know the the temple was thrown down children of Israel taken into captivity but when they returned to build the temple and it was finished let's see what happened Hagi the second chapter if you can turn to it I pray my my voice will hold up to today okay and and let's just read verse three to save some time here they gathered the people together and he asked them a question who was left among you that saw the house in her first Glory what a question huh is there anybody here he says that saw this house in its first Glory how do you see it now they had finished this Temple and it was called now zarab Babel's Temple Temple and he says is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing after seeing all the gold and the silver that was put into the first temple how do you compare this next one with that first one and then after saying that hagy gives a seems like an unusual ual prophecy this is verse n it says the glory of this latter house glor shall be greater than of the former sayith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace sayth the Lord of hosts as the temple was being rebuilt there was a group of Jews there in Jerusalem who were actually a little bit disappointed these older Jews who could recall the grandure of the first temple they regarded Zer Babel's Temple as a poor substitute of the original and in their minds it did not compare at all with Solomon's Temple it was true that zabel's Temple was built on a smaller scale with much fewer resources than Solomon's Temple had been and also Solomon's Temple had housed the Ark of the Covenant it had they had witnessed Fire come down from heaven it had been filled with a Shina glory and still hegi prophesied that this second temple would one day have a magnificence and it would outshine Solomon's Temple we're we're getting somewhere he says one when this one one of these days it's going to outshine the other Temple I know you saw the gold and you saw the silver but there's something going to happen that that will make Solomon's Temple seem a little dull his words were fulfilled 500 years later when something happened that did not happen in the first temple he said the glory of the latter would be greater than the glory of the former 500 years later the Messiah Jesus Christ comes walking through the temple of zerbel it was no longer the walls that was the that was the attraction come on church I'm going to say it again it was no longer the gold and the silver that was the attraction but now God Almighty in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us and the body of that word came and walked right through the temple okay so now we're getting somewhere you see the first temple and the second temple as great as they were was not the great mystery it was not the great mystery that God had in the back part of his mind this is where many people fail today they look at the message and they said wow what a great message and they're always looking back as what God did back then or they're always looking forward to what God is going to do but very few realize and see what he's doing right now I'm going to tell you right now the glory of what's in this building is even greater than Solomon or zarab Babel's Temple oh come on do you believe that or not let me see your hands if you believe it there's more Glory going on right now than there ever has been in the history of of mankind because now the bride what had been promised people staying on that now listen to this this is where the people go where people will go they read the message and it's tremendous but there's a point brother Bram says where the attraction goes from the prophet oh come on now I'm going to say it again there's a point at which the attraction go from the prophet to his prophecy now I'm going to say it again there's a point at which the attraction goes from the prophet to his prophecy in other words what I'm trying to tell you is that every prophecy has to have a face the devil don't care how much message you know he don't care how much scripture you know but you know what he cares he trembles when the scriptures has a [Applause] face I'm going to say it again he trembles when the scriptures get a face he trembles when prophecy has a face now my question to you is this what are you the face of oh come on now I'm going to ask you again what are you the face of uh oh I can I can say God bless you and leave the pl right now and you all go home wow right you want to paint yourself up real nice well maybe you're the face of Max Factor maxor uh oh they didn't like that one huh wrong exit come on now what are you the face of I'm coming to something here now this is so tremendous mendous when we see the first God wanted to reveal himself he couldn't do it as all great the Elohim the great Jehovah God who covered all Space and Time and Eternity he could not he was too great to reveal himself to the people it was too mysterious and so what does he do he realizes he needs a face oh come on say it again he realizes he needs a face so then if he needed a face he needed a body First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 and 20 what he needs a face what he needs a body what what a question what know ye not that your body this is where we get this is where we get caught up I know oh this filthy flesh filthy flesh I try to do good and Evil's present can't overcome this is no good for nothing wait wait a minute the Bible says what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify ify God in your just your spirit glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods what makes this body so valuable we know it's not this this this 16 elements what makes it valuable is the soul that's on the inside you think that Solomon Temple was was valuable brother brandham comes and under the inspiration he puts a value of your soul at 10 million worlds oh no come on come on and look at your neighbor say neighbor you're worth 10 million worlds no no you got to you either you're going to believe it or you're not I'm not trying to go deep I'm trying to go very simple for you how many temples do we have here temples of the Holy Ghost time however many times 10 million worlds this building what is inside is so valuable you were bought with such a price and you've been given such a value and yet we sometimes settle for nothing and we're sitting here say I'm a Christian I don't have no money for my rent oh Seed of Abraham huh come on you know what I'm talking about you can put anything there you know what you struggle with you know watch watch you always ah I don't know I don't know about this I don't know about that I talking to anybody here oh I forgot that I have good value brother we have a value of 10 million worlds but I can't take a withdrawal oh no I might use it all up 10 million worlds you don't sound excited you think I'm you think I'm just doing a it's a fairy tale or what church you are worth that you you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost tell your neighbor again neighbor I am the Temple of the Holy Ghost if you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost then the temple now has a face hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to say it again the temple now has a face do you believe that the temple has a face now we're going to find out what face you are Genesis 1 1 and 2 I'm just putting a little little Foundation brother Titus says we're not in a hurry today so in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep you couldn't tell the face it was it was not what is it looks kind of through a glass Darkly and the spirit of God then moved upon the face of the waters now once again the spirit of God today is moving upon the face of the waters or of the people because Darkness has covered the Earth and gross Darkness has covered the people but God needs a a face today God needs a face he needs hands come on nowbody up there have any hands he needs hands he needs feet he needs eyes that's what we want to find out today are you part of that body are we his face are we his body brother Braham says he said I am the vine and ye are the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit the branch bears fruit and the only hands he has tonight is our hands the only eyes he has is is our eyes and here's he's here in the form of the pillar of fire the resurrected Christ now to be the face of something it it's a tremendous thing to be the face of something is to be the feature it is the embodiment or recognized representation of the thing all right all right come on now it is the embodiment in other words it's got to come and it's got to dwell inside am now just hold on with me okay I should have gone to bed early last night church tomorrow yeah I know never mind that's let's go on if we're talking about the face of a sports team I happened to see that the other day news LeBron James says that LeBron James Anthony Davis is the new face of the Lakers Anthony Davis isers that means that there's confidence that everything that the Lakers are Lakers it's embodied in in that player he is the representative of that that team you can go on and there's certain products in certain stores and they all have their spokesperson you can go to a country a country has the face that is the face of that country where's he at I asked brother Jeffrey here Jeffrey who is the face of the bueri people you don't know that that's the king who is the face of Uganda Jeffrey B he did he didn't [Applause] hesitate I'm getting to something here you know I'm you know I'm just I'm just I'm trying to keep you calm and comfortable and rela he had no problem saying I am the SE come on and this is where I Are you a are you a Christian uh I I I don't know you know I mean just depends how I'm feeling no I'm going to ask the question are you a Christian are you a son or daughter of God okay who who's the face of that I want to know who the face of Christianity is [Applause] today amen wait wait a minute amen me amen oh see amen amen my goodness are you sure you're not a good representative if they ask me who's a great representative who is a face when they say a Son of God that's me oh come on now I said that's me what are you the face of this morning are you the face of just a church denomination are you are you the face of your high school your colle I don't know but you're the face of something I was driving back with brother Jeffrey's father we were com from Los Angeles back to crues he had a suit on I said brother John you know you can put on some more comfortable clothes it's going to be a long trip and uh you can be comfortable he looked at me and said I'm not just a king in Uganda Uganda [Applause] he said I'm always a king wherever I go come on Church you're not just a son or daughter just in church you're a son and daughter always you are the face of the children of God and let's act like it let's live like it let's stand like let's talk like it shake your neighbor's hand say neighbor I'm glad neighbor we are the face our actions our fruits will tell us who we are if you want to be the face of Christianity then you got to be like Christ not like your your brother ah well she dresses like that why can't I if you want to be the face of Christianity then you got to be like Christ what kind of people should we be the very Holy Spirit watch watch Whose face you are if the very Holy Spirit has has embodied or empowered then you don't use your thoughts no more mind you don't use your own opinions the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit Spirit expressing itself through you be the face Church of that church be the face of that church not of some denomination not a called or lukewarm church but the very representation of the church the bride of Christ and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against why because the Revelation has a face now I'm going to say it again the Revelation has a face and that's what Satan fears read the scriptures yeah search them in them you think you have eternal etal life but they are they that testify of me what is it because the scriptures are waiting for a face oh we're going to get to something good here it's time to become the face of who and what we are representing I have a niece that's going to college there in in Arizona she said Uncle I walk in there with my dress my skirt she says and I dare them to ask me why I wear skirts and dresses oh come on we have it so hard because we got to wear dress and skirts she said Uncle I dare them to ask me all I could do was just go that's all I need not embarrassed because she knows she's the face of something she is the face of a lady you don't find very many ladies anymore who's the face of of a lady who's the face of modesty anymore oh I wanted that to settle really good God would walk and talk with Adam every single day finally an Express son that God could talk face to face you see the attributes that were in him he couldn't have Fellowship until they were manifested then he could talk face to face watch now Adam was the face of a Son of God Son of God Adam but he also was the face of God of this earth oh come on now you know what happened that face was lost but he was the face of the God of this Earth imagine that how you doing father oh we're doing wonderful today was a wonderful day when the fall happened the veil was taken away and the face of Adam changed and it was no longer someone in control it was no longer someone with Dominion no it was now a fallen Son of God his whole complex his whole his whole look changed and I can see God looking at him that's not the face of my son that's not the face of the God of this Earth and that's why he says Adam Adam where are you you're lost in the darkness and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the deep chur that's what we need today is for the spirit of God to move upon the face of the waters we need faces to be restored representatives to be restored it's time we stop playing church and think it's okay because we jumped and shouted you can jump and shout and still have the same face but one time that you step into the holy of holies and he comes into the soul and he changes your heart your face [Music] changes brother brandham says you can tell you can tell when the when the presence of the Lord is moving around the building said can tell when it comes upon someone he says because their face changes something different oh I I see faces changing already oh that's look the sister right there the Lord's touching her right now what what do we come for just to hear a good message no we came so that we could become the face that's what this generation needs he needs some young people that'll stand up and say I will be the face to my generation you're the only way they'll ever know who God is who's willing to be the face of their generation I see a bunch of young people up there which of you want to be the face of your your generation come on now where's the young people your generation needs a face and unless you come and get a new birth and filled with the Holy Ghost you simply be the face of the world he's calling for you right now oh I see faces starting to change oh I don't know how much time I'm I've been going but brother said who cares the world isn't isn't embarrassed why are we brother Bram says that Abraham he portrayed Christ in faith faith whose face Abraham who's that Faith oh Isaac portrayed Christ in love in Jacob portrayed Christ in Grace and Joseph portrayed Christ in Perfection they were the face of those attributes but today love also needs a face I don't know why they don't talk to me in church well look at your face what they said Abraham Lincoln was a was a pretty not so handsome man they said that one day they had to vote on something that he said he was going to do it one way and he decided to vote the other way so they said H Abraham Lincoln abah Lincoln he's a two-faced person you know what Abraham Lincoln's response was AB Lincoln look at this face if I was two faed I would be wearing the other face just to relax you a little bit through the prophets and the sages thearch each one was portraying certain characteristics they weren't the complete face they just had certain things about them you with me certain things about them but the the real face of God was coming wait a minute I don't I don't know about you this was deep to me the Great Elohim Elohim was going to finally say I got my own face [Music] now you may not get excited unless you didn't I'm I'm GNA leave that one there Moses go and let my people go set them free I'm sending you but I'm going in you but but but who do I tell them to sent me tell them I am that I am in other words Moses you're going to be my face you're going to be God and Aaron will be your propheta Wow Wow Come On Church it's time that we recognize who we are and what we are Isaiah prophesied he said a virgin shall conceive can you imagine how many virgins said maybe that's me maybe that's me it took 712 years later for the Virgin Mary to come on the scene and say I am the face of Isaiah's prophecy come on now I am her she told the angel be it unto me according to Thy word I will take the responsibility and I will be the face of that prophecy oh blessed be the name of the Lord and one day he finally steps into his Tabernacle his son Jesus now that's the face of Redemption red maybe the Angels didn't recognize that face at first Redemption salvation we don't know much about that this is my face for salvation there is no name given under heaven whereby we can be saved but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you all know about the wsh Revival yeah we've heard that many times they had heard about the Revival so when they go they go to a policeman and say where is the wel Revival Welsh the policeman just looks at them and says I am the Welsh Revival in other words he was the face of the Revival I said brother Jeffrey who is the face of the Revival in Uganda why a be Jeffrey he said I am the face of the Revival in africaa in the last couple of years over a 100,000 people have come into the message there's a revival going on but you know what I also heard a rumor I heard a rumor that there was a revival going on in Fort Collins Fort Collins come on now who the face of the Revival in Fort Collins and Fort [Applause] [Music] Collins wo come on now who's the face you got to say I am the face the Revival we have Revival fires going on around the world right now I saw the face of the Revival in Poland I saw the face of the Revival in Norway I saw the face of the Revival in Fort Collins fors I've seen the face of the Revival in Los crues I've seen the face of the Revival in colia colia come on now you got to be certain of God you got to know beyond a shadow of a shadow of a Shadow of Doubt that Revival how many prde part of the Bride of Jesus Christ do we have are you sure but maybe you're sick a little bit who cares come on now where's the bride she's got a face all right let me finish where I'm going here ahead of myself I know we can we got we got to wait on him a Revival Goes Forth and that's why too many people they're always looking for a Revival in the future sometime it's coming bride's Revival is coming soon one of these days I'm not I'm not going to go in there and say it's not true but we read the third seal where the B where brother BR says the bride hasn't had her Revival yet right there hasn't had it yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders to back there to wake her up again he will send it he promis now watch she was she was dead oh my she was dead you see he was barely in the third seal when he said that but a year later he's already brought the seals he's opened it up and now let's see what he says recognizing your day everywhere there's no Revival everybody complaining ministers crying and this Herald of his coming I'm just going to paraphrase this they they won't print anything unless it's fast fast and pray pray and sound a trumpet they want a Great Awakening oh they want it they're crying believing that there will be awakened they're good people but what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride oh I'm going to say it again the seals are now open the Revelation has been put forth and they have not recognized The Awakening they're looking for a different face that's why can't be that brother yeah I know about him Noah Noah Awakening is a Revival don't tell me you're going to make it if you have not been revived if you haven't been awakened you ain't going to make it you better have already been awakened something has to already be revived or quickened in you we listen to the message we read our Bibles we must find out ourselves there says look and read the scriptures you got to find yourself in the scriptures read the message you got to find yourself in the message we listen and we listen and we listen until one day we must become the word or the face of Our Generation I want to challenge you people especially the young people who will be the face of your generation I asked you that question earlier but I'm going to ask it again who will be the face of your generation I got one brother up there I got a couple of hands up there couple hands who will be the face of your generation who will be the face of Revival in your generation oh my we're getting more hands who will be the face of the message to your Generation Well I think brother Brandon made mistakes I just have to say is that's it that's good interpreting when thanks come on now we need a face there's a bunch of wonderful faces but we need a face your generation someone that is fearless someone with courage someone that will stand no matter what comes against you come on now I need he's looking for a face someone that will love him no matter what we need a face now who will it be once again Satan don't care what the scripture and the message says but he doesn't want to see a face put to it listen to this now and this is the challenge things that are to be brother says I'm I'm beginning to get old and I know my days are numbered and I know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it to the coming of the Lord you know what that means that there will be preaching all the way to the coming of the Lord come on where's these ministers at there's going to be preaching all the way to the coming of the Lord you don't need to preach anymore maybe not you but I have to preach because I am the Fai you are the face one is the face of the message we are the message of William brandham oh come on now watch what he says here you see these brothers like brother Parnell and brother Willard they're young fellows but if there's a tomorrow they that that they'll be that men of Tomorrow listen now I don't want this message to never die oh when you become the face you take on the responsibility then it is your responsibility to never let this message die I'm tell you that as long as I have life in me this message will never die we are keeping the voice of Elijah alive CL up higher Church This is Voice of Truth Tabernacle this message will live on I'm GNA say it again this message will live on will never die because it came from God and God cannot die nor can you and I die because we are him we are bone of his bone we are flesh of his flesh we are Spirit of his Spirit we are life of his life we are power of his power word of his word we are him oh I don't know if you believe that or not I'm going to say it again we are him oh brother Titus I don't know where I'm at brother but I don't know how much time I have left but just give me like 10 15 minutes please is that okay all right here we go Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 Revelations 107 it already happened has a [Music] [Applause] face oh come on you don't sound excited it already has a face he said you might resent this my friends may leave me but I am the voice of God to you it already has a face but I ain't done there because Ephesians 41 and 12 and 13 oh come on Church Ephesians 4 I've already seen its face when I look at the Ministers of the Gospel I see the face of Ephesians 4 don't don't tell me it don't exist I've already seen the face Hebrews 138 already has a face he's the same yesterday today and forever let me give you a little testimony this is not brother kale if you still think that we we're trying to raise ourselves up you you missed it a million miles we ra up Jesus Christ it's not by coincidence brother brother Titus that I'm I I'm on my way to the airport to come here and I get a phone call and it's a mama crying for her son my heart sank they weren't calling for brother Caleb but they knew there was a face there and behind the face was Hebrews 138 she said brother my son was just in an accident his arm is mangled in pieces they're GNA they're they're they're taking him in to amputate it oh my lord your heart drops he had gotten away from the Lord that young man I said put him on the phone I said don't worry about your arm I got to worry about your soul I said you know you got away from the Lord we could be planning your funeral I said but God rich in Mercy I said he gave you another opportunity to make it right now I can't be sincere for you but I will tell you this about that time the presence of the Lord comes down in the vehicle and I said but I will tell you this it's no more brother Caleb talking now he's come on on the scene I said if you can in your heart tell the Lord father I will return to you I'll give you my heart I'll repent I said upon your confession then I'll pray according to that now if you're not sincere I said then ain't nothing going to happen they're going to take your arm but if you can be sincere I said then they ain't going to they ain't going to cut your arm off oh he started crying he says I know I got to get back I hung the phone up and a couple of hours later the mama crap she calls crying but this time of joy said brother they didn't have to amputate his arm I said oh no because Jesus came on the scene I will arise with healing in my wings the son of righteousness has arisen and he's here right now for you where's your wife brother wait where's your wife at she she here somewhere where she at she's coming oh okay come sister do you believe sister believe how much do you believe that's his presence

his flesh and bone of his bone while we're yet Mortals ready to die he still quickens this body he brings it to life where once we drank and committed adulteries running around but now he quickened us why because that thing died you are resurrected it quickens your mortal body therefore Church your bodies is the Temple of the Dynamics why because from the beginning you are part of the mechanics oh

this place you know brother Bernie said something yesterday he says you know sometimes we talked about skipping over the beginning of messages to get right into the we think the meat of it I've been guilty of that but not today I Was preparing this and I came across this and uh I had been just hearing the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed it'll become your favorite message one of them they're all my favorite but anyways and I began to read it and the Holy Spirit took me back and I went through it and I kept reading and the Holy Spirit says go back you're missing it went back and I read it and brother Bernie he's dedicating a little baby I'm like well Lord we're dedicated a church not a little baby he said read it again so I want to read it to you I believe just before we start we have a little baby a cins on Callins oh come on [Applause] last time I checked we're in Fort Collins in Fort Collins amen we're we're dedicating a baby that's right because there is word children being produced from this place I'm sorry I get beside myself he says now I'm not now now this is me I'm not calling the people babies but what is being produced the cins they they have a little baby they want it dedicated and uh we want to do that now if brother and sister Collins are here is brother and sister Collins here okay where's the Collins Fort Collins churchs his brother and sister Collins here okay you're here okay if they'll bring the little one forward so that we can have the dedicational service for this little fellow as these are loyal members of the body of [Music] Christ and then brother Bram says you notice I never said of course loyal members of the Tabernacle he says but of the bodies plural of Christ this body here a part of his body and they got a little fellow that they want dedicated so we're going to dedicate this little fellow today amen and amen it wasn't coincidence either that Solomon dedicated the temple in October yeah that's what I said the Bible says on the sth month I know brother that's July abib is the first month April May June July August September October okay all right so we're we're doing good so far huh this event that is happening and has happened I want you to always remember it is not just a natural event it is a supernatural event and it's not just a supernatural event it is a preder natural event prer natural is that right somebody help me you somebody help him prer natural people don't know what prer natural is H I got you today this is a natural event first of all meaning that it is occurring in the natural in the Physical Realm and can be witnessed by our natural senses but it's also a supernatural event meaning there is no way that man could have ever orchestrated this all the events that happened for this event to take place this is the product of the physical and the spiritual the then the Earth Earthly and the Heavenly uniting together to make it a supernatural event but it's also a preternatural event meaning that it was marked out and determined beforehand before the before the foundation of the world was ever now you know preter natural I want to say this and I'm going to read this from brother brandham and I'm goingon to ask if brother Titus and and all the ones from from uh members here at Voice of Truth Tabernacle if you would stand to your I am so very proud of of this brothers and sisters here I'm going to say it again I'm so very but I want to tell you this as I read this love one another everybody understand love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now everybody want to look around at them one great sweet group and then brother brandham says but remember my warning say won't let that stay that way everybody you got it you're a sweet group but Satan won't let it stay that way he'll shoot everything if he has to bring in someone to make his Target he'll bring some critic some unbeliever he'll sit him down cause him to fellowship with you under quietness and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right there loving one another but pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman whoever it is and stick one with another and stay with your pastor ouch ouch we are the face of the message remember remember stay with your pastor he's the shepherd and give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the ones that the devil's using for an enemy he'll either get out or become one of you stay together that's one thing that my father always told us no matter what happens stay together you ain't going to make it by yourself Stay Together as you remain standing I want to just read the scripture here in Acts [Music] 7:44 I'm sorry let's go to verse 47 but Solomon built him in house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will ye build me sayeth the Lord what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things Hebrews 105 says wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me which verse was that 10 I believe brother Titus is a man of vision and along with the people here have received this building this gift from the Lord so that the people can have a place out to get out of the rain and the snow where they can Worship the Lord this is a City of Refuge a lighthous in a dark world for the dying can run to and the only way to stay successful is to stay with the word stay in line with the word and although David was not able to build the temple he gathered all the materials that would be needed in order for his son Solomon to construct the temple and Solomon never varied one bit from the pattern of the temple that Moses saw in heaven what a spiritual application he says that we never leave the scriptures stay with the pattern that's the reason I believe the first church was patterned after it the next one patterned and everyone will be pattern the same way that's where the spiritual Builders today that's why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom because the builders rejected the Cornerstone the Chief Cornerstone that was laid on the day of Pentecost which is the baptism of this holy spirit that is the real church now not of mortar not of brick or stone which perisheth but the real church is built upon the revelation of the word and the will of God a great day the day of dedication has arrived brother tius when they were come to dedicate the building the worshippers worshiped the building would have been a building in vain had it not been for the worshippers that came into the building but the building is now ready for dedication so now I as we bow our heads what a beautiful thing when he says the bo but a body hast thou prepared showing that God was going to dwell in a body and when this body his body of 2,000 years ago had been made a sacrifice the correct lamb had been sacrificed there was coming forth then God came to his own body which was his bride now my sincere prayer is that every worshiper will dedicate their own Temple to Worship in this Temple that's being dedicated today as we bow our heads we raise up brother Titus his wife his family and the church our heavenly father we are most humbly and sincerely assem assembled here this morning in great appreciation of the love that you have showed to this congregation Lord they have showed Lord that they their desire is to work for you Lord and Lord you gave them this building for worship Lord this pastor here brother Titus minister of your word Lord and as a place being dedicated for worship we as worshippers lay aside everything every contrary thought every weight and the sin that thus so easily beset us Let each one run the race Lord with patience father bless this this church and may the worshippers gather Time After Time After Time May there be such a love for you Lord among them till they just can't stay away apart from each other that they can feel fulfill the scriptures Lord that said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord may they be so salty as you said Lord you are the salt of the earth May their lives be so rich and wholesome in the Holy Spirit until all the community around will long to be like them now take each one as we give the church the building to you Lord but now we give ourselves to you as well in solemn dedication and may the holy spirit in all of his divine power his Shina glory Lord come rolling down through the eternities into every heart Lord and may it find Lord may you find your Dwelling Place for these last days Lord maybe not all our ministers but as Messengers that each one is Lord at their jobs and at school each one be a Beacon of Hope and may there be such a great Revival that would sweep through this country around these towns Lord there will be such a noise that nothing can stop it we pray for this group Lord a dedication of love you have blessed their efforts Lord and so we ask a blessing on the pastor his wife and family the ministry the deacons the Usher the treasures the trustees the Sunday School teachers the youth leaders the music directors the musicians Lord the Ley in every office present in the church may they continue to feel their calling and their purpose and one of these days Lord when the services are all over over and time is no more may each one

he was there with us amen amen just want to uh greet you today I'm not good at greeting when I'm preaching part of the training I received from my father even though he was good at greetings but he would he would always kind of get upset and he would invite somebody to preach and they would spend a lot of time greeting him and thanking him and on the way home he would kind of grumble I didn't invite that guy to come to greet me invited him to preach the word get up there and preach the word but uh but he would go places he would greet people so I don't know I I think the I think the grumblings spoke louder to me even what he did but um so I um want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I want to extend greetings from our pastor in Phoenix Tabernacle Brother Joseph Garcia sends his greetings in Christ Jesus name he couldn't come because he had to take his wife to California but so he sent me in representation and he asked some brothers to come also to represent him at the church I would like to ask those that had come from Phoenix Tabernacle to please [Applause] stand thank you brother s amen I um I love being part of a family U mostly because one of my favorite quotes we can fight in the backyard amen amen but in the front yard we're brothers amen so we love you in Christ Jesus name and we're part of your family too and uh I don't know how many have heard me preach more than once but I just want to to to let you know to assure you that I don't get up never behind a Pulpit to throw rocks at anybody that wasn't what the pulit was lent to me for to preach the words of Life the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life we trust that God has we know that God has blessed us through their services so would you like to send a greeting back to our church and Phoenix thank you I'll I'll give that to you start this good afternoon pleasure for me to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ one of the greatest privileges I've had in my life to be able to be in in the feast this this morning where God has manifested himself and he he himself came down directly to inaugurate and then give you this place God has dwelt in in this [Music] place everybody has privileges but the children of God are the privileged ones I thank brother Tito for allowing me to stand in his place Most Holy place on Earth not only the mountains around but it's a Pulpit because from there proceeds the word of life so we're sitting in Heavenly places and we're sharing in the joy and thinking how God wise how wise God is the the elders are for the edification of the following Generations he said how many Elders were in this place made for you this is in the Bible and he hasn't even realized it I have 50 years in the message I have low miles a lot of miles so I have to be going slow around the curves my wife accompanies me my my son-in-law as well and my daughter and my granddaughter we are accompanying you in this beautiful Feast because in a feast where there's no there's no drunks and there's no [Applause] shouting and in the day of Pentecost there was a great a a great uh party in where there was a lot of drunks and it it went up unto all the nations here also and is the same standard this torch that God has inaugurated today illuminate all this region to find that predestinated seed still does not know of this Marvelous Light this light that has dressed the bride there has not been a greater light not even the the light of the sun has the light that the bride has because the the sun will end and the bride will live eternally so for me it it it is a joy to be able to be with you I'm here in America for seven months I I left my my my church I left her because I am not dead and when a when a widow gets married they they she loses the husband but the one that doesn't get married ET she has a husband until eternity so I'm under a certain treatment that the doctors from Colombia gave me it's a work of it's a 50 years 50 years of ministry it affected me tremendously I was not able to to stand in the Pulpit any longer sometimes you faint so the the church was there I had to take my health seriously I came where the Lord was where the Lord starts and ends in America in America because did you know that the first when God stood on the here on Earth and when the the light came forth it was in New Mexico in Texas haven't you read from the prophet the Earth was started in America and the earthquake is in America as well read the message well so for me this was a marvelous surprise this this great invitation and although I was a little delicate of of Health I uh I talked to my son my son and my son-in-law and daughter so that they would bring me you know how the children are with you don't don't you're like like a kid again it's the the children and the grandchildren and I began to look at myself I had I hadn't checked my ID card and I thought it was 30 years old you're 80 years old they told me I went up to the next floor floor the three friends started in mystery brother brother myself I'm I'm the one that's left as a [Applause] witness [Applause] and I thank God because he said something and now I realize God is never left without a witness was my he was my pastor my friend closest thing to my conscience confidence my best friend was brother Tomas one time we were in Phoenix we left service we came down from with brother and myself center of a phoenix the Lord comes down and tells me I give them to you as a friend that's why I always we always we were always with with each other and we treated each other as good friends and when you have a faithful friend you also have a lot of envious people theyr you friend but there is friends of friends so for me it is a joy they asked me to greet and I started preaching that's the problem with and we sleep we're we wake up the the [Applause] wife something that's in us and it's just something inevitable
