[3:27] God bless you brethren
[3:32] we greet you in the name of the Lord
[3:33] Jesus Christ
[3:36] as you're standing I invite you
[3:41] open your Bible to the book of First
[3:43] Samuel chapter 18.
[3:46] verse on verse one and on
[3:52] how are you this evening
[3:56] we hope that you're okay
[4:03] first Samuel chapter 18 verse 1 and on
[4:10] if when you have it if you can please
[4:12] say Amen so I know that we're ready to
[4:14] read
[4:19] what if God says like this
[4:34] and they came to pass when he had made
[4:37] an an end of speaking on to saw that
[4:40] Saul of Jonathan was knit with the soul
[4:42] of David and Jonathan loved him as his
[4:45] own soul
[4:52] and Saul to Kim that day and we let him
[4:55] go no more home to his father's house
[5:05] then Jonathan and David made a covenant
[5:07] because he loved him as much as he his
[5:10] own soul
[5:15] foreign
[5:28] that was upon him and gave it to David
[5:31] and his garments even to his sword and
[5:34] to his bow and to his girdle
[5:37] um
[5:53] sometimes we come with so many things in
[5:55] our minds
[6:01] and it's difficult to process what is
[6:08] Lord I know I don't have enough words to
[6:11] speak
[6:12] I don't have the capacity
[7:04] take your seats
[7:07] and this evening
[7:15] we're speaking as their title youth
[7:17] Brothers
[7:22] a great person in the Bible
[7:35] the friendship that David had with
[7:37] Jonathan
[7:41] I believe that before speaking on
[8:43] Concentra
[8:58] you don't have to answer just meditate
[9:05] how many people nowadays can say
[9:09] yes
[9:14] here she is a good friend
[9:18] look
[9:19] is
[9:27] your friend
[9:32] you come to church
[9:35] means you have a friend
[9:39] is
[9:58] my friend
[10:00] or they are my friend
[11:01] really open with
[11:08] what you like
[11:11] what moves
[11:16] what are your true intentions
[11:22] you can find good friends or good
[11:24] friendships in this time
[11:25] Society
[11:31] we have friends
[11:35] to our own uh ideologies
[11:38] what does this mean yes
[11:41] this person
[11:45] oh he's my friend
[11:48] that's how it is
[11:55] not in agreement
[11:57] that he's not my friendship
[12:04] how they are
[12:08] a true friendship I believe
[12:13] responsibility
[12:19] you are wrong in this area
[12:24] that is not a true friendship it's just
[12:27] a friendship
[12:29] just words
[12:31] field
[13:45] of Israel
[13:47] amen
[13:58] is
[14:04] I have to translate in my mind he was
[14:06] the royal seed he was
[14:10] a royal seat of a royal lineage see
[14:14] David
[14:39] they had to have something in common
[14:43] I could imagine brothers and sisters
[14:49] Jonathan almost
[14:56] occasion youth
[15:06] telling the general
[15:09] is
[15:10] this young man David won Mega no he is
[15:15] he got ahead of me
[15:17] to fight against Goliath
[15:21] ills
[15:23] because the Bible speaks to us in the
[15:26] next chapter
[15:29] Jonathan sees this this happening
[15:32] Goliath
[15:40] tomorrow
[15:43] Jonathan I'm almost sure
[15:46] yes those that study the Bible say he
[15:49] was there
[15:53] when he sees this this man
[15:57] the characteristics of David
[16:03] and his heart is connected
[16:09] the Bible says that David was according
[16:11] to the god
[16:13] dare to say
[16:17] he wasn't far away from the heart of
[16:20] Christ
[16:24] foreign
[17:23] he won a battle
[17:28] when Jonathan sees this
[17:35] something changes in the heart of
[17:37] Jonathan
[17:38] the Bible tells us
[17:46] love them as himself
[17:55] when I read this church
[17:58] May
[18:00] um
[18:42] they became one
[18:48] it's hard for you
[18:52] to be able to be another person with
[18:55] another person yes
[19:31] it was a prince
[19:35] look closely
[19:40] see this young man
[19:42] he recognizes
[19:49] it's going to be something great
[19:53] you know why he reckons garment
[20:08] [Applause]
[20:14] you know what it typifies the Royal
[20:16] garment
[20:25] a prince
[20:30] look you sometimes
[20:33] is
[20:35] difficult to admit for
[20:38] for someone else
[20:42] or someone else is better than you
[20:44] is that right
[20:49] nowadays it's hard for us as humans and
[20:52] I believe it happens
[20:59] than me
[21:03] is doing
[21:08] his Royal
[21:10] Royal
[21:21] but now you're winning here you're
[21:23] getting it now is
[21:25] the mind you
[21:27] mind
[21:28] because because nowadays you don't even
[21:30] see
[21:32] little
[21:34] today we can't
[21:37] we can make a compliment a sincere
[21:39] compliment what's your compliments
[21:41] we can't
[21:47] well I told myself I was I was not going
[21:51] to speak
[21:52] but I feel it
[21:57] the compliments we do only by
[22:00] conveniences sometimes
[22:02] by convenience for a convenience
[22:09] the Friendship of these two young people
[22:12] United
[22:14] [Applause]
[22:16] recognize their positions
[22:26] there's David
[22:30] there is the mantle
[22:33] the position
[22:36] what else did he give him
[22:39] the Bible is here says garments
[22:45] you know what the garments signifier
[22:47] means possessions
[22:52] amen
[22:55] what a tremendous friendship
[22:59] this is
[23:09] friend the friendship was so great
[23:16] David says some tremendous words
[23:20] I'm just summarizing a little here
[23:26] so David as Jonathan did
[23:30] that love in the woman
[23:48] because you open
[23:51] you know this
[23:53] is
[24:07] no true friendships
[24:10] okay
[24:12] I'm ready
[24:16] but the Bible says
[24:20] true friendship
[24:25] that was so different
[24:28] but yeah they had the same time they
[24:32] United
[24:34] they made a covenant
[24:38] what a tremendous thing
[24:48] or the robe
[24:52] garments you give him his garments
[24:56] he gives them his sword
[25:04] Jonathan is letting go of things
[25:09] may God help us
[25:16] what we can say I want to find a
[25:18] friendship that hurts
[25:25] a true friendship requires of sacrifices
[25:29] it requires to be able to say
[25:32] um
[25:41] yes Brothers
[25:45] see yes
[25:48] I've always thought about this
[25:53] and I know there is
[25:57] that they can do a better job that they
[26:00] do it
[26:15] and you want to be the star
[26:18] s
[26:19] [Music]
[26:20] so the whole world can see me
[26:26] successful
[26:28] everything
[26:42] he let go
[26:47] you know what this is not for me
[26:50] this is foreign
[27:18] I believe there's a lot but okay
[27:22] meditate
[27:34] I close and our pastor comes forth
[27:42] we have to find friendships
[27:49] not only see their own convenience
[27:55] I admire La Iglesias
[27:58] that the church that my children are
[28:01] growing in is
[28:05] my grandchildren
[28:09] and my great-grandchildren
[28:13] Iglesia I admire it to be a church
[28:16] I desire to be a churches
[28:21] where there's true friendships
[28:25] I know I know God has given us and I'm
[28:29] very happy
[28:32] now take this time to say thank you for
[28:34] everything you've done
[28:35] all of the helps
[28:39] in the name of my daughter
[28:41] of my son-in-law told me
[28:45] I feel so happy
[28:48] pero
[28:50] LA mistadermanos but the Friendship is
[28:57] accepting as we are as how we are see
[29:00] yes
[29:02] almost different except that we are
[29:05] different
[29:07] yes we can be different
[29:10] but
[29:12] yet have a link that unites us
[29:21] let's keep pushing forward
[29:36] foreign
[29:44] because I believe it's a very important
[29:46] story
[29:51] because it speaks to us and how to be
[29:54] true friends
[29:55] as God is a true friend
[29:58] there's no greater friend than God yes
[30:03] when when
[30:07] is
[30:09] first time 23. verse one
[30:15] hello hello yeah
[30:18] yeah okay
[31:14] you see that Jonathan helps David escape
[31:18] and in this chapter 23.
[31:45] and they rob the threshing floors
[31:49] so it is
[31:58] therefore David inquired of the Lord
[32:00] saying shall I go and smite these
[32:02] Philistines and the Lord said unto David
[32:03] go and smite the Philistines and save
[32:05] Kayla
[32:08] now for you to get an idea of what's
[32:10] going on here uh David David
[32:13] he had he fled from Saul is
[32:16] [Music]
[32:19] he's trying to save his life because I
[32:21] was looking for him
[32:29] certain people
[32:32] that begin to pursue as well
[32:36] it is during this time that he's fleeing
[32:42] he truly becomes a leader before the
[32:45] eyes of the people
[32:47] the Bible says
[33:27] so David begins to have a gathering of
[33:30] people around
[33:31] of a bunch of weird people
[33:35] because David was uh
[33:37] he was
[33:40] weird in his worship
[33:43] he was on the way he did things
[33:47] on one occasion he even had to like a
[33:49] crazy
[34:15] because you're someone who understands
[34:17] us
[34:49] with these Rebels
[34:51] [Music]
[35:26] verse 5 says so David and his men went
[35:29] to Kayla and fought with the Philistines
[35:30] and brought away their cattle and smelt
[35:32] them with the great Slaughter so David
[35:33] saved the inhabitants of Kayla
[35:36] he went to go fight a battle that wasn't
[35:38] his
[35:39] foreign
[35:58] God hath delivered him into my hand for
[36:01] he is shut in by entering into a town
[36:03] that hath Gates and bars
[36:12] David goes in helps the city um Kayla
[36:15] that was surrounded by walls it was
[36:16] close
[36:21] he realizes that he's closed off
[36:24] and he says oh God
[36:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[36:29] tremendous how everyone worships God
[36:32] right
[36:39] verse 12. David
[36:43] realizes that Saul's coming down
[36:46] and he had just helped the people from
[37:05] now look at what class of friends
[37:11] David had done all that he could with
[37:14] his girlfriend
[37:20] he helped him to win the battle against
[37:23] the Philistines
[37:27] the king comes
[37:29] and he says now I have David David so
[37:33] David Goes
[37:36] these people have just happened
[37:38] they're going to help me or they're
[37:40] going to turn me in
[37:41] and God says they're going to turn you
[37:43] in
[37:45] now notice how God guys
[37:50] go to Canada
[38:21] how many have you have experienced
[38:23] betrayal
[38:25] comes
[38:46] they betray you
[38:50] and I tell you Brothers
[38:54] someone who speaks of others will speak
[38:57] of you as well
[39:00] as a pastor I tell you
[39:06] we'll speak of you as well
[39:09] yes
[39:14] this is
[39:15] verse 14 says
[39:29] and David Abode in the wilderness and
[39:31] strongholds and remained in a mountain
[39:32] in the wilderness of zif and saw Sodom
[39:35] every day but God delivered him not into
[39:36] his hands
[39:38] the Wilderness
[39:44] it was a Refinery the it was the
[39:46] Wilderness
[39:48] it's where they refine the minerals
[39:51] foreign
[40:12] God is working
[40:33] God is refining you
[40:36] foreign
[40:55] for the last time
[40:59] so on the campus
[41:03] Jonathan was there as well his son
[41:09] but he was David secret friend as well
[41:12] he was a secret uh inside guy his friend
[41:31] and went to David into the wood and it
[41:34] says and strengthened his hand in God
[41:41] did find it
[41:44] no they're still in control I don't know
[41:47] if he found him or if David allowed
[41:48] himself to be found
[41:51] but the thing is I look at what Jonathan
[41:53] does
[41:54] this is the last time he's going to see
[41:56] him that's why Amigo his friend
[41:58] he knows his friend is in danger
[42:00] you know what his dad is looking for him
[42:04] of course he's not going to tell his dad
[42:05] where his friend is but he goes and
[42:08] seeks him
[42:09] and look at what a true friend does he
[42:11] says
[42:16] it says and he went to David and
[42:20] strengthened his hand in God
[42:21] now this is tremendous
[42:24] many people cry with you they complain
[42:28] with me
[42:30] Amigos the very few friends
[42:33] or those that encourage you no says
[42:40] yes you're going to be able to do it
[43:41] want to be your friend
[44:07] David was going to be friends with him
[44:10] [Music]
[44:27] because he made a pact a covenant
[44:31] um
[44:34] it required for them to go and sacrifice
[44:38] and it requires work
[44:42] you were showing that he was serious in
[44:44] what he was doing
[44:46] I believe that a true friendship
[44:49] commitment it requires
[44:54] someone
[44:57] who says
[45:03] there's no greater friend than the Lord
[45:11] when we're doing well when we're not
[45:28] he was putting himself on David's side
[45:31] and not on the side of his father
[45:35] he was making a decision
[45:38] we can't be everyone's friend
[45:42] we can be friendly with everyone
[45:44] are you with me
[45:48] but he who is a friend of all is a
[45:51] friend to No One COC yes or yes
[45:55] the person who tries
[45:57] he's gonna he's gonna go wrong with
[46:00] everyone
[46:02] you have to decide who's going to be
[46:04] your true friend you can love everyone
[46:06] Jesus Jesus
[46:12] [Music]
[46:16] I call you my friends
[46:19] a true friend he gives his life for
[46:23] December foreign
[47:23] foreign
[48:17] was great
[48:24] makes you feel like you're great
[48:32] and if you want to be a true friend
[48:35] because look Brothers I beg God
[48:41] foreign I believe that is
[48:45] if you find a true friend here on Earth
[48:52] it's better than winning the lottery
[48:56] but it's not easy
[48:59] I hope that all of us have a Jonathan
[49:03] but if we can't have a Jonathan
[49:06] let's be a Jonathan then
[49:10] foreign
[50:10] foreign
[50:44] amen
[50:47] let me tell you
[50:49] we can be Jonathan's
[50:52] we can be a Jonathan
[50:55] uh
[50:57] Our obligation should be to be a
[51:00] Jonathan for for God
[51:01] for the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:07] to to give up their Throne that is what
[51:11] Jonathan did
[51:12] he gave up his throne
[51:28] but nobody wants to be number two
[51:32] foreign
[51:49] [Music]
[52:35] to give up his throne
[52:40] he knew he was going to fail David it
[52:42] was not going to fail he was not going
[52:44] to fail David
[52:46] and that he knew that David was going to
[52:48] fail him it was not going to fail was
[52:50] not going to fail him
[52:53] meet it
[52:58] look at first Samuel 20.
[53:04] this is the second time we find Jonathan
[53:06] with David
[53:08] first Samuel 20.
[53:11] first Samuel 20 verse 13. it says
[53:19] I love this story
[53:23] that's why God placed in my heart to
[53:25] speak on this
[53:26] you can read chapter 20 yes
[53:32] that's when they would be
[53:34] uh
[53:36] chapter 20 uh
[53:39] there's an encounter between Jonathan
[53:42] and David
[53:43] and David tells Jonathan
[53:46] your dad wants to kill me
[53:50] through Spirit
[53:52] through another Spirit
[53:55] a third Spirit
[53:58] now look how tremendous Jonathan is
[54:32] he still believed in his father
[54:46] and the Bible says that Jesus says
[54:53] obey my Commandments
[55:00] is a requirement
[55:02] to be the friend of Jesus
[55:06] I think that being a friend of Jesus
[55:10] makes you want to follow his
[55:12] Commandments
[55:28] I'll do whatever you ask David
[55:31] and David asked or tells him
[55:36] there's a big Feast here and I'm not
[55:39] gonna I'm gonna go there
[55:41] they did a certain Feast here
[55:44] and if your father gets upset
[55:47] then you're gonna know he wants to kill
[55:49] me
[55:51] now the feast is is brought about
[55:57] and
[55:58] David doesn't come to sit at the king's
[56:01] table
[56:03] because he was already a part of the
[56:05] king's Nobles he
[56:09] is
[56:16] he just has something going on he wasn't
[56:18] able to make it the following day
[56:25] yes where is Dave located
[56:27] he wanted him there so he could kill him
[56:41] Saul gets angry with Jonathan
[56:46] you know one of the things one of the
[56:50] reasons
[56:52] for which anger is so stupid
[57:02] because sometimes we think we can direct
[57:04] or Channel it towards a certain person
[57:06] or object anger
[57:07] problemas
[57:09] the problem is that anger cannot be
[57:11] controlled
[57:16] do you think that you're just gonna hate
[57:18] brother Titus
[57:21] but you end up hating your own family
[57:24] because anger begins to disperse it
[57:27] begins to spread and what happened
[57:38] why are you angry
[57:43] that he throws us Spirit his own son
[57:46] that's what anger does
[57:50] you say oh I'm just angry I'm just angry
[57:53] with the sisters
[57:55] with this person no no no no no
[57:58] if you if
[58:01] you're going to end out angry with your
[58:04] own family
[58:05] because anger always
[58:08] yes
[58:24] David
[58:34] and he goes and he tells David
[58:38] and they make a pact
[58:41] IC
[58:43] verse 13.
[58:46] or in verse 15.
[58:56] they said
[59:10] the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan
[59:13] but if it pleased my father to do the
