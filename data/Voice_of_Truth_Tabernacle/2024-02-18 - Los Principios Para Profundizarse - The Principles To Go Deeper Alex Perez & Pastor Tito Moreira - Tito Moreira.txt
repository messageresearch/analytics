welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ believe it's good to be in this place Psalms 92 verse2 when you have you can say Amen thank the Lord for the privil to be here and to be standing behind the pulpit um when you have a say Amen God's word reads the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like Cedar in Lebanon and chapter the next verse 13 those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God the Lord blessing to his word you may be seated this morning our title we are sharing along with our pastor are principles to be deeper as you know we've been speaking a few weeks a month two months on how to get deeper with God how to go beyond with God I believe the Holy Ghost has led our P to establish this subject because I believe can go deeper with God I believe every one of us including myself we cannot say I've come to the fullness with God come to be so deep with God that I can fly no I believe we can all improve the Christian relationship the relationship between God and us I believe should be deeper every time as you know God's word multiple of times Compares us to trees we could spend minutes talking about God's word how his word Compares us to trees and and other types of plants and palm trees and I believe it's convenient for us if we want to go deeper with God to examine what occurs in a tree in this case I want to focus on a palm tree because I feel there are special qualities about a palm tree and the scripture we just read tells us number one the righteous it's something wonderful to read this because the righteous shall flourish uh a Hebrew version of the Bible flish is to expand is to grow renew yourself is extending that's what flourish means so the righteous shall flourish or expand grow like the palm tree to begin the question comes to my mind who is righteous because seeing my life I'm not righteous I find that my own righteousness and quotations I can't profit of anything the Bible says our best deed like worldly Rags my righteous rag before God I cannot benefit it doesn't help me a lot but when I take his righteousness when I take God's word then I realize that I am full in him give a clap offering to the word of the [Applause] Lord are you gonna forgive me we were sharing some notes with the pastor I feel like my notes got a little mixed up I want to tell you something this morning there's something wonderful about a palm tree the first thing that we must do before the palm tree can put Roots down says a palm tree can be as high as 115 ft there's a beautiful quality about a palm tree that it grows straight up no matter where you SE a palm whether in the valley or in a mountain something inside makes her grow vertical she is is not grow cricked but before examining everything something we should notice first we must be S so you can go deeper with God so you can expand or St Ro thing we should do is to know where we will be planted it matters where we are placed we will be established because it matters a l where you will spread your you will advance with God County I was telling the brothers last week in Orange County um one of the things I was sharing brother Ro and told him before I came to the message of the through the vessel that God chose our pastor brother Titus I went through plenty of churches I was like that tree that is rooted up and placed somewhere else before the message I could never put Deep Roots on and so much I could never produce if you don't put Roots rooted completely it's hard for a tree bear fruit have you notice it's not fixed yet so it's okay um I don't know what happened have you noticed thank you brother it is fixed now I think it's God right have you seen trees that don't bear fruit you know if a tree is planted and after a season they transfer it runs RIS that it will die because pled established stay there I cannot be moving around tell you I made a decision about 12 years ago AC this ministry and trials have come battles have where my tree been threatened Roots have moved says something while the Tre it's swinging storms are hitting the the roots are moving stretch in deeper can grow deeper God for the storms for the battles but it's important to be established someone that is planted has made their decision that that will be the place where they will grow put Roots down and for consequence good consequence will bear fruit a tree when it's inside that tree something tells it you need to establish yourself let me tell you something this morning I believe many times looking at my own life why can I why can I be closer why do I need to look for God more maybe I'm not established i't planted myself how I it's time to put it's time to grow in God like fruitful trees the scripture he was a he was a man wherever he was he could bear fruit flourish but we need to be planted Bible says in Isaiah 40 says that bringeth a princess to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity justification is based on knowing something that it's not by my own not me leading the ship it's not me growing it's him giving me the says God that bears the fruits at the end of who will make us go deep but we have an important role to play because sometimes we don't want to be established we must make a decision y they shall not be planted y they shall not be sown their stock shall not take root in the earth and he shall also blow upon them and they shall wi and the worldwind shall take them away as stubble look the things without roots do not last long they're easy or quick to die can I preach freely a person without making their decision where they're going to put their Roots down is moved easily by wind they are a cloud without there's no stability and the consequences there's no roots I want to put Roots down because the roots expands bear fruit to our time to go to bear fruit the people's there's the Son of God no reflect Christ what a beautiful word La pal the palm tree when is sewn we usually find a palm tree in tropical areas but I'm speaking about a palm Tre in the desert that we are in a A wilderness world World we're bombarded by many things I want to grow more God but many things bother me the world daily Society they show me different they teach me different things I see a war in my and I say deeper with God but the world is stopping me the world doesn't let me the world brings me I believe it's important to be sincere with God lord I want toow I don't care I the world I want to grow with you Bram says it doesn't matter where you are produce a new life makes a new life it calls my attention a palm tree the palm tree in the East because they don't bear fruit immediately look the things that last you don't see the result quick you don't see the from night to morning the things that last or the trees that really bear fruit they go through a process when own life and I see I'm here I believe you're here I don't think you're here wasting your time want to grow in cemented in the word the palm tree in the east they say it does not bear fruit until seven or 10 years after it's planted notice I tell every one of you don't be discouraged if you haven't seen anything yet maybe you see your life and say I haven't produced much or anything one year goes by two years go I don't see anything I don't see a fruit get rooted in get Ry to make and sooner or later you'll bear fruits we are told that when the palm tree and I'm closing when it puts its roots down in the wilderness it begins to open a way where there isn't that palm tree is seeking water you'll say How can there be water in the desert yes there can be can bring water in there's water you need a palm tree it begins to open way begins to crack the J it's not easy it's not easy to put Roots down it costs work it cost I'm going to work I'm not satisfied to be deeper we're told in the desert when a palm tree begins to put its roots down it cracks the ground if you can put the image for me until they find water when they find water then they find their purpose keep growing Church keep establishing yourself in God we're told palm trees are around oases if you look in the desert there's an oasis and it's because that palm tree fought so much broke the ground to connect with the water I am not satisfi living a superficial purpose in God by consequence bear fruit God bless [Applause] you let's read in the Book of John chapter 1 verse 45 we're speaking about Beginnings principles I'm sorry laws of how to be deeper and we want to take what our brother Alex spoke and speak to you about seriousness and sincerity you need to be serious you need to know where you'll be placed and stay there because sin is serious I repeat that sin is serious so serious that it sent the Lord Jesus Christ to the Cross it's so Ser God himself had to come and fix the case in person he did not send an angel did not send a different person sin is so serious that him himself I will go fix this problem and he himself died at the cross sin is serious and God is serious with us God son needs to be serious with him to have complete seriousness and complete sincerity with him to be establish John 145 speaks to us of Philip and Nathaniel if you can look it up because I'm going to read more than those verses [Applause] there Philip finded Nathaniel and sath unto him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph I want to tell you we have found the truth that is what Philip tells we have found the truth we have found the Fountain of Life found where eternal life oh when you have found the TR you should go there you should want to be established there rooted next to Jesus planted in Jesus and Nathaniel said unto him notice the sincerity notice he wasn't trying to be a good person and be educated and not hurt anyone's feelings but he says this can there any good thing come out of Nazareth in other words this sounds like a bunch of Lies Nathaniel now although he wasn't saying anything good but he was sincere about he wasn't pretending to be anything [Applause] else let me tell you brother we shouldn't have to pretend with God there are people there are people that they can't stand when they're sincere with them they can't stand being told told the truth they can't stand being told you know why I don't like your food we always have to be careful we have to be we have we think oh we make them feel good let's not make them feel bad and there's people that can't stand the truth can't stand being told you know why you look hideous you know that that clothes doesn't look good there's people that can't stand there maybe some of us are that way God isn't that way God can stand us being sincere him not only can stand or enjoys it when we're sincere with him after Nathaniel said this that came out of his heart notice how Jesus answered Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no G in other words this fellow is sincere love this about him he calls white white tried to please anyone simply wants the what's true he had just said he had just said Can there anything good come out of Nazareth nothing good comes out of Nazareth and Jesus answers I'm sure Jesus had just finished hearing what he said maybe not with his little but he knew who Nathaniel was and he says behold Israelite indeed Israelite there's no G when Jesus was choosing his disciples he didn't say this about Peter and he didn't say this about any other disciple what about Nathaniel this fellow is a true Israelite and there's no go there's no hypocrisy he's not hiding to please anyone is a man without G Nathaniel sayith unto him whence knowest th me in other words that's the way I am Jesus answered him said before that Philip called the when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw the Nathaniel answered sayith unto him Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel now notice how tremendous this man left or when from saying nothing good from Nazareth can come to say Rabbi th art the Son of God th art the king of Israel why what a tremendous man that can be sincere with God God loves someone that's sincere because sincerity and serious are linked together when someone is sincere that person can become to be serious and when someone is serious they take seriously what they're saying and someone standing seriously with God someone that can go far with God because they're not playing they're not pretending if they do it they'll do it I say this is true because I will stand with it I will give all I am for itet got the queen of she she stood up for Solomon she was willing ready when she found the truth when I find the truth when I find what's real I will support with everything I have says when you find the truth when you find what's right supported with everything you [Applause] got amen message of hidden life in Christ brother BR says bottom chion uhh the last paragraph of that that next quote you may not grow like a mushroom uhhuh you know how mushrooms grow right right mushrooms from night to morning they bloom no one put them there but they they there appear all of a sudden we see oh where this come out from says don't grow like a mushroom but prefer to be an oak tree than a mushroom come calm come slow Root Down Your Roots well come easy come slow get your roots grounded and fast and right then you can come on then you are sure oh brother let me tell you I prefer to come easy I prefer to come slow I prefer to come without not a lot of noise but that my roots where are rooted says get your roots grounded and fasten right then you can come on and then the prophet continues saying now tonight as your brother and your servant in the Lord Jes let me ask you something do this to yourself and mean it notice how BR brah speaks about sincerity here after speaking about the oak and the mushroom and roots and being placed and then he tells us to be sincere sincerity means that you've peeled back those layers of those initial feelings because sometimes we have initial feelings and you've dug deeper and have seen deeper what the root of the what do I really believe come on Church sometimes we're not sincere with ourselves we think because we're in church we're okay but we haven't peeled back the layers of our feelings of our thoughts and go deeper and say do I really believe what I'm saying I believe am I truly where am I truly where I'm saying I am Church how many have gone excited and say yes I'm going to do that oh that sounds good but be sincere let let those initial emotions or feelings meditate a little and say after I got excited do I still want to do that is that what I'm truly facing do I really know what awaits for or am I just getting excited come on Church many of us only get excited in church and that's why we leave and nothing changes because we were never sincere we only got [Applause] excited we only get excited and don't look deeper deeper under our emotion beyond what the preacher said and and think what are they trying to tell me this should change my life this is not just any type of change this is something serious a walk with God is serious it's not just anything it's not just lift your hand and say Amen it's a life changing it's a change in [Applause] nature do I really know what I'm facing am I really willing that's to be sincere and I understand you can be sincerely mistaken but brother brandham says I'll throw my lot in with someone that is sincerely Mist because they're at least standing for what they believe than someone halfway that's why the Bible says I prefer you be cold or hot you're going to be mistaken but stand what's what you're mistaken for but in this morning we're not mistaken we have found the truth and if there's a higher truth in this tell me where it is this is the highest truth I found I need to be so sincere as I can be watch how brother brandham says do this to yourself and mean it come to the Lord Jesus say God you know what my fault is you know I have these little things I have to battle every day and I have a hard time of doing it that's why I'm standing here notice the prophet he's telling us you need to be sincere with God that's the way to be placed part of the principles of a place of going deeper with God you need to be sincere go beyond your feelings you need to see your mistakes God prefers someone angry than someone pretending to be happy say God I'm angry with you come on church not everything is happening but let's be sincere with him let's say Lord this journey is hard it hurts to leave the evil my soul my heart hurts I don't want to let go come on God prefer someone that way that says Lord I love I love the world I love the world a lot let's not pretend to be Saints here let's not pretend oh yes tell God I love worldly music tell God I love this flesh help help me do that man help [Applause] me God is able with your sincerity God can endure and I understand there are many of us that have never been able to be sincere sometimes we can't someone being sincere with us there's people that can't stand it as a pastor I see people in different levels if I there's people that I see and I I know if I tell them you're messing the next service they won't come to [Applause] church that's I need to watch How I say say things but there are people that love sincerity that love when someone tells you're messing up you're not being real there are people that can't stand their entire life trying to please someone else and they never say when they don't like something there are people that can't be sincere or don't know how because they are used to pretending to be something they're not but God can end I'll tell you this your brother might not be able to endure so be careful your wife or your husband might not be able to endure to be truec with them but if there's someone that endures is God God prefers someone sincere their heart someone that can tell God look at all the sin there's in me like the Centurion when God told him if you believe if you can believe all things are possible C said I I believe but help me believe there's a lot of unbelief in me sometimes we have to say God have a lot of unbelief Don't Be Afraid with God sometimes you have to say Lord I don't believe you I don't believe you but I want to believe you forgive me for not believing enough you Sinners that's never come to Christ before come to him say Lord here I am I'm Aaron's Old Rod I'm no good but Lord I'm going to lay right at your feet watch how the blossoms begin to come out watch how the fruits begin to yield now say it seriously on church this is the problem here's where brother brandham says say it seriously from the bottom of your heart don't say it playing come on church we need to be like children but not do childish things like children in our sincerity but mature in our seriousness we're not here to play Church we've played church too long it's not to be playing anymore like children it's to mature take your place seriously take the place you've taken that bank seriously and say Lord I want to be a Christian that's serious with you why do I come to church if I won't believe you why do I come to church if it's not from my heart now really mean it he's speaking one one after another I'm not jumping around now really mean it from the bottom of your heart and God will and God will take each one of you tonight right into his kingdom I'm not a person I'm not emotional I'm not a worked up Affair I believe in real Holy Ghost religion that's right this is just pure and holy that's true brother and that's what I'm here to teach that's what I'm here to introduce now I want you to come like that tonight to the Lord Jesus saying Lord I want to come in you give me this Tabernacle and I brought it to justification I joined a church well I haven't yet been consecrated Lord I've come and I've tried to live a church life but I've had ups and downs now I want to come into the consecrated place come in Lord take me out of the world tonight drop the curtains around me and let me hide off with thee here in thy Shak Glory where the glory of the Lord shines I want to say it's time to be sincere with God it's time to see beyond have the courage to look beyond your presentation towards the rest begin to see so what really is inside of you I want you to be sincere be sincere with a few questions with God and so God can help you are you happier in sin than in the things of God you need to ask yourselves these questions to get deeper with God now if you see it in the flesh you will say yes if you are sincere I'm sure no one will say yes because everyone's going to think this or that about you but let's just begin on the first layer if you see it in the first layer through the flesh you'll say yes and many of us are even more happy yes sir I yes sir I see so watch a football game I see you more happier doing that than here in church there are people that look happier when they're going to watch a game or get their pop watch a movie they put their their slippers on oh how comfortable a big smile I let's be sincere that are happier out there than in here let's be sincere with God say you know what sin excites me Hallelujah but then let's go beyond that when all of that passes am I happier after those initial feelings pass how do I remain do I feel empty do I feel sad do I feel lonely when that first layer of emotion passes and I go deeper when that moment of gratification passes when the high left you when the buzz left you when you did whatever excited you after and then it passed how are you now are you happier are you happier now you're being more sincere because now you're going deeper in your heart and you're saying Lord I'm not as happy because when all those feelings pass when the friends left me I I realize I feel so bad inside so empty inside see that's what God wants that you go deeper and be courageous enough to recognize Lord the reason I am here is because I'm not happier out there I'm not happy doing what I want otherwise I'd be better off but I want to tell you the truth of the truth of the truth is that I'm only happy with you I am only truly happy with you and Lord if this makes me happy help me be serious with this not be playing with you musicians can come who answer the hi you please [Music] stand I was [Music] meditating in the scripture of Isaiah 53 talks about the Lord Jesus Christ and says like roots and dry ground like roots in dry ground there's no Beauty in [Music] it but like roots in dry [Music] ground and I say God did not put Jesus next to the water God put him like a root speaking of Jesus [Music] because it's in the moment of drought it's in the hard place it's in pain where we become more sincere it's in pain and tears we turn more sincere that's why I made you go through the W to know what was in your heart everyone can worship when everything go everyone can pretend to in a good place but put them in a tough situation put them in a painful the true colors will shine that's what God wants you show who you truly [Music] are stop pretending to be a Christian for a moment stop pretending to be a [Music] scholar and see how miserable you are see how out of order you are see how much help you need with God Lord I'm in pieces I haven't believed you completely sometimes I don't know if this is the truth or not I'm not sure if this is a TR but I want to be sincere with you if you Pro to me I will be serious I'll take you serious because sin is because the devil is here hell is I need to take him [Music] serious he is your friend and a friend someone you can confide in you can be sincere with be sincere with with yes sir someone you can tell what you're thinking you can think in a voice out loud with God that's what he wants with you come to him be sincere with him say God I [Music] struggle have you allowed so many things in my life and I don't understand God what are you trying to do with me my most intimate moments have been when I complain to when I say God what are you doing I don't understand you I don't understand why you don't [Music] listen those moments have been where
