[Music] in which they found themselves referring to the children of israel and it continues saying how difficult it was to return listen how difficult it is regresar to return to the place of origin or to the place of our origin after having been exiled for around 70 years 60 years 70 years yes and the last time that i went to mexico i thought that everything and i get there i begin to see many different things many surprises the little ones that i'd left from seven six seven young men of 12 or 13 years old miss padres and my parents you could see el tras how years had gone by for them algo cambiado something had changed in their face in their countenance they were a little more hunched over and the city was no longer the same las cayas [Music] this is themselves the hardest challenge they've ever faced because our pastor says that every anyone can start from ground zero it's easier to do that then to start once again pick up where you left off yes and it's true move or pieces of 25 feet and they're filled with like hey imagine 300 feet and uh to just to make the perimeter roundy fence it off the dirt not leave right and to go and place him is the easy part but when i get there and i see which makes that material that much heavier est and it's filled with dirt and that's what i want yesterday it's already been damaged let's move the or we have to move the dirt that's already uh gone out and that took me like two hours if you can put the images here the second image please on the 6th of august of 1945 a bombing aircraft from the u.s drops the first atomic bomb and more than 70 thousand people die instantly this is a part of the city of hiroshima now we can go on to the next image now this is the present-day city of hiroshima is important this is the city of berlin after being bombed the next slide 80 of the city was destroyed now for a moment hitler pensaba he thought of berlin of making the city of berlin la capital mundial the world capital but look at his dream in rena's ruins next slide now this is how it shines now in days in the present day and they are still even rebuilding it and now berlin is one of the most important cities of germany europa of europe perhaps without life a felice not even the most happy not even the most encouraged could have could have given could have placed to construct from the from the ruins why because it's a great labor inaudib and give when amen de dios as an instrument of the grace of god she was sent to to occupy the throne of god and she moved the heart of the king her husband who allowed quenemias nehemiah su pero her her her cupbearer vulvira returned to jerusalem name is of babylon and now um a true overcomer constructs over the ruins these men esdras ezra when they get there have [Music] are the ones that are willing to are the ones that are motivated and do it out of love all the men of this church for the women do the faith by experience [Music] if there's if anything that christ could not use in his kingdom would be a coward we see here he said have faith in god they would have taken hope on getting to jerusalem that that hope would have been but it was affected it was a lot rather than look for cowards [Music] over but he prefers is [Music] time those same waters that brought oh that brought ruins our judgment to them we're the same ones [Music] and i'd like to retake this it's because you saw something good in you yeah amen amen before getting to the apostolic church i found myself in ruins i began to realize i began to feel things in my body i began to feel bad and that's
