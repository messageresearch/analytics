[18:34] [Music]
[19:00] tonight
[19:01] [Music]
[19:12] certainly awesome to be here in the
[19:14] house of God once again
[19:18] amen the Bible says that I Rejoice with
[19:22] those that said to me
[19:26] to the house to the Lord
[19:30] amen praise be God
[19:33] if we can open up our Bibles
[19:37] see the book of First Kings
[19:42] chapter 17 and verse one capitulo this
[19:45] is
[19:53] amenities like this
[19:56] and Elijah the Tish bite who was of the
[19:59] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as
[20:03] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[20:05] whom I stand there shall not be doomed
[20:07] or rain these years but according to my
[20:10] word Anton says
[20:21] if we can just buy our heads real quick
[20:26] thank you Lord Jesus gracias for another
[20:29] opportunity to be in your house
[20:32] we just ask that you come and speak to
[20:35] us today
[20:37] May our ears be attentive to your word
[20:40] guys
[20:42] guide us and may we just leave this
[20:45] place blessed fathers
[20:48] we were The Interpreter
[20:54] we ask this in the name of the Lord
[20:56] Jesus Christ
[20:59] amen amen amen you may be seated amen
[21:07] so we're going to be opening up a new
[21:09] character
[21:12] Elijah
[21:15] amen Elijah is a very familiar character
[21:18] for us living in this age amen
[21:24] because we know that we also had an
[21:26] Elijah
[21:29] and uh for a title
[21:32] I place with my brothers
[21:36] we placed according to thy words
[21:43] amen amen and just for a little bit of
[21:46] background of what we just read
[21:51] um prior to Elijah coming on to the
[21:53] scene
[21:56] there was a lot of evil in Israel
[22:02] there was a king named amri his
[22:07] name was Omri and he was the father of
[22:10] Ahab um
[22:12] an army was said to be the evilest of
[22:15] the kings of the time
[22:19] but then Omri died
[22:23] and then Ahab succeeds him as the king
[22:27] and then Ahab takes the place for number
[22:30] one as the worst King Israel had
[22:34] Israel and then during his time as king
[22:41] Ahab marries Jezebel
[22:45] and Jezebel is a foreign
[23:14] so God's people turned had fallen into
[23:17] idolatry at the time
[23:21] and they started to listen to a voice
[23:25] that was not the voice of God
[23:29] Amen the people began to worship a god
[23:33] a pagan god named
[23:37] amen amen and this leads God yes this
[23:43] leads God to bring this mysterious
[23:45] character Elijah to the scene
[23:48] mysterious
[23:50] I say mysterious
[23:53] because Elijah it doesn't really give
[23:55] too much about him
[23:59] it just what it does say though is he's
[24:02] from Gilead
[24:06] and that pretty much tells us that God
[24:08] chose how to take some Foreigner yes
[24:18] to draw the people's hearts back to the
[24:20] father amen
[24:23] amen you're able to see a lot of
[24:25] parallels there between brother Branham
[24:28] and Elijah there muchos
[24:31] because brother Branham was a mystery in
[24:34] himself
[24:36] if you were to go out and ask people who
[24:38] brother Branham was
[24:42] no one would know
[24:44] and no one knew who Elijah was either
[24:48] amen but they both have the same
[24:50] Ministry
[24:52] which is found in Malachi 4 5.
[24:57] Uncle I mean it's a familiar scripture
[25:00] at least I hope it is
[25:04] um and it reads like this it says behold
[25:07] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[25:10] El profetely before the coming of the
[25:14] great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[25:17] and he shall turn the heart of the
[25:19] fathers to the children
[25:23] in the heart of the children to their
[25:25] fathers
[25:28] lest I come and smite the Earth with the
[25:30] curse amen
[25:34] amen so God chooses Elijah
[25:37] amen I believe that God chose the right
[25:40] man for the right time
[25:44] amen and brother Branham Elementary he
[25:48] puts this in a very awesome way that I
[25:50] really like
[25:53] brother Branham says he says that Allah
[25:57] Elijah heard the still Small Voice
[26:01] and he says this in the message what do
[26:04] is thou here it is
[26:08] in 1959
[26:12] he says we've had the Thunders
[26:15] we've had the fires
[26:18] we've had the Russian women
[26:21] and the earthquakes
[26:26] send us this still Small Voice
[26:29] that's what we need
[26:32] listen Brothers we need that still Small
[26:35] Voice
[26:37] a still Small Voice
[26:41] amen I believe that that's what God was
[26:44] trying to do here in this situations
[26:47] is that God was trying to steal the
[26:49] people of Israel
[26:52] to get them back to him amen
[26:55] and I think that oftentimes when things
[26:58] happen in our lives
[27:01] it's not that God's being unfair with us
[27:04] or that he's angry
[27:07] or trying to punish us okay
[27:12] but when God takes things away
[27:15] God is trying to steal us
[27:19] so that we can hear that still Small
[27:22] Voice
[27:24] God works in Stillness
[27:27] amen he stops the rain
[27:30] he stops the Harvest
[27:34] to get everyone to be still and to
[27:36] recognize that he's the true God
[27:42] there's a scripture here yeah I just
[27:45] want to read for a quick reference
[27:49] it's a Psalms 46 10.
[27:54] and it reads like this is
[27:57] be still and know that I am God
[28:01] I will be exalted among the heathens
[28:05] I will be exalted in the Earth
[28:12] at the end of the day God gets all the
[28:15] glory amen
[28:17] whether or not we give it to him that's
[28:19] our choice right
[28:22] amen another thing that I noticed
[28:26] was that when God speaks
[28:29] there's something out there that has to
[28:31] respond
[28:34] when Elijah
[28:38] the rain wouldn't come down
[28:41] so in this story it was the nature that
[28:44] responded
[28:47] amen but in our time
[28:50] we know that it was a deep calling to a
[28:53] deep
[28:55] we know that it was Brother Bruno's
[28:57] message
[28:59] and that something has to respond
[29:03] and this was a mystery to me for a
[29:06] really long time
[29:08] I didn't understand what a deep was
[29:12] and I still kind of I still I'm kind of
[29:15] starting to understand it a little bit
[29:16] more yeah
[29:18] any time I read it but what I'm able to
[29:22] capture from what brother Branham says
[29:28] it's a call
[29:30] and and it's a call from God yes
[29:34] so and he says that God wouldn't make
[29:37] that call
[30:36] amen but the way amen
[30:59] [Music]
[31:00] amen
[31:02] God is good Brothers
[31:07] amen
[31:09] it's in the times when God speaks to us
[31:13] that we have to be still
[31:16] often times I wanted for God to just an
[31:20] audible voice just come and speak to me
[31:25] but God in himself
[31:27] if he never spoke to me
[31:30] in an audible Voice or through a sign or
[31:34] something that I knew perfectly well it
[31:37] was for me
[31:40] he wouldn't be wrong
[31:43] because his word is enough
[31:46] the Bible says that greater is he who
[31:49] did not see and still believed
[31:54] amen so if I never I never see him down
[31:57] here Anton says
[31:59] then I know for sure I'm gonna see him
[32:01] up there yeah man praise be to God
[32:07] amen amen now we just have to question
[32:10] ourselves again
[32:12] is whether or not we're going to allow
[32:14] them into our lives
[32:17] and if not then what's the reason that
[32:19] we're not going to let him into our
[32:20] lives
[32:23] amen for Israel
[32:25] they didn't have them in their lives
[32:28] because they had a God in his place amen
[32:32] and maybe we have another God In This
[32:36] Place
[32:39] sometimes we're the god ourselves we
[32:42] worship ourselves
[32:44] and there's no room for God
[32:48] Amen I take pride in my education
[32:54] um but I've realized that I've only
[32:57] gotten this far
[32:59] by the grace of God
[33:02] so anything that we do
[33:04] it always points back to God
[33:08] whether or not we acknowledge that
[33:11] that's our choice
[33:13] amen but if we don't serve God
[33:16] we're going to be serving something else
[33:19] I would rather serve a God
[33:23] who knows and cares for me
[33:26] and something that's Eternal
[33:29] something that's going to last
[33:32] then something that I very well know
[33:36] that it could not be here the day of
[33:38] tomorrow
[33:40] amen that's all I have God bless you is
[33:45] [Applause]
[33:49] Vita
[34:19] foreign
[34:37] as the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[34:40] whom I stand there shall not be do nor
[34:42] Reign these years but according to my
[34:44] word
[34:47] so we're going to stay on this phrase
[34:50] but according to my word
[34:53] um
[34:56] what a wonderful scripture
[34:59] Vida and what a wonderful life
[35:12] now we know the Bible doesn't tell us a
[35:15] lot of how he was brought up or raised
[35:19] we believe God does Supernatural things
[35:30] focusing on the news
[35:36] but I just want to share a little on
[35:38] Elijah
[35:40] how he appears
[35:45] I believe God's word
[35:48] because I believe
[35:52] when the devil thinks
[35:56] the devil thinks he has
[35:59] when the devil thinks
[36:01] he has us
[36:05] not always sends someone
[36:09] esteem
[37:14] the seed of God is
[37:52] now this was in the years
[37:58] now if you want to find out about
[38:00] history go and find out about history
[38:09] it was a time where there was so much
[38:17] yes
[38:58] now they are together
[39:02] and the Bible says
[39:13] [Music]
[39:18] word of God
[39:20] the message
[39:29] without an eye
[40:13] hold up
[40:24] do you think you could leave this
[40:26] building
[40:28] you heard this word
[40:31] come to me follow me
[40:37] come to me
[40:42] now you can open your eyes
[40:48] because I'm leading you as a leader
[40:53] from the conditions
[41:11] from this Darkness
[41:18] we won't leave
[41:21] that is
[41:28] now how many youth have not been filthy
[41:32] or dirty
[41:43] but now as a question how many of the
[41:46] ones here
[41:47] we fail daily
[41:51] yes
[41:53] that's wonderful
[41:56] so be sincere
[41:59] that we need of God's house
[42:02] we can't make it alone
[43:06] because I'm a message
[43:09] Apostle Paul says
[44:04] this is important
[44:08] now this man's father
[44:11] was a bad King Samaria
[44:33] who did evil on the sight of the Lord
[44:35] above all that were before him
[44:44] the Lord above all that were before him
[44:52] imagine the type of King leading Israel
[44:58] how these people
[45:01] in a great confusion
[45:06] so an Earthly kingdom yes
[45:20] for this flesh
[45:22] that pleases this
[45:25] fleshosos
[45:36] or enemies
[45:40] now that's what helps us control
[45:42] ourselves
[45:44] now we're all tempted
[45:47] not because we're message Believers
[45:51] we think we're holy
[45:54] amen
[45:57] sometimes the devil lies
[46:00] I'm a message
[46:03] Believers
[46:05] yes you should be careful amen Brothers
[46:13] and it came to pass as as if it had been
[46:16] a light thing for him to walk in the
[46:18] sins
[46:20] it was very light for him
[46:23] of all that he did
[46:27] he got used to it
[46:32] he got away from the things of God
[46:37] Holiness
[46:49] and get more filthy yes
[46:52] you're used to it
[47:02] foreign
[47:57] okay
[48:03] after this man got married
[48:08] he went and served
[48:12] is
[48:14] and after he served him
[48:18] says he worshiped him
[48:40] and then now Elijah
[48:54] they had gone away
[48:56] from Godly things
[48:59] from Holiness
[49:03] from worshiping from harm yeah
[49:06] that's how it happens to us
[49:10] we get used to coming
[49:15] yes
[49:36] I'm falling asleep
[49:38] because that also foreign
[49:44] [Music]
[50:36] transfer us
[50:39] amen brethren
[50:41] amen
[50:44] we're only speaking
[50:46] what do you need in this night
[50:51] [Music]
[50:52] there should be a pain in us
[50:57] and on this Earth
[51:49] in this night
[51:51] all right amen
[51:53] [Music]
[51:56] sir amen
[52:05] my time is over
[52:08] and this is youth
[52:20] according to his word
[52:23] [Applause]
[52:29] God bless you brother
[52:34] forgive me for taking a bit of time
[52:39] I don't want to interrupt my brothers
[52:43] I'd like to just thank God foreign
[53:10] thank you very much
[53:12] with
[53:13] is
[53:15] now we're on Elijah
[53:18] um
[53:19] my wife told me
[53:22] Dios
[53:24] how much did God
[53:27] didn't love the spirit of Elijah
[53:31] five times
[53:35] we'll use him five times
[53:41] he has used his Spirit four times
[53:44] and that's something tremendous
[53:46] [Music]
[53:49] how much did God love this man
[53:52] that he used him over and over
[53:56] now look
[53:59] if you see the Bible
[54:03] there aren't any great presentations for
[54:05] this man in in in Primera de Reyes and
[54:08] First Kings
[54:13] this man appears on the scene
[54:16] but not a lot of mentioned about it
[54:19] is
[54:35] or a great last name
[54:38] he just appears on the scene on the
[54:42] contrary
[54:43] foreign
[55:14] thou are anointed cherub that covereth
[55:17] and I have set thee so
[55:20] perfect
[55:25] that was perfect from the day that thou
[55:28] was created so iniquity was found in the
[55:31] multitude is
[55:43] by the multitude of that merchandise
[55:46] they have filled the midst of thee with
[55:48] violence and now has sinned therefore I
[55:50] will cast thee as profane out of the
[55:52] Mountain of God and I will destroy the
[55:53] old covering cherub from the midst of
[55:56] the stones of fire
[55:59] was lifted up because of thy Beauty
[56:05] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[56:08] of thy brightness
[56:13] I will cast thee to the ground I will
[56:15] lay thee before kings that they may
[56:17] behold thee you know I believe
[56:21] the real seed of God The Real Son of God
[56:29] presentations
[56:33] yes there's simpleness
[56:39] the prophet says
[56:46] and he wore camel skins
[56:53] maybe with a tan skin of the heat
[56:57] that was the man God wanted to use
[57:01] Hermanos as our brothers said
[57:13] than his ancestors
[57:17] he began to worship this God bail
[57:21] yesterday
[57:23] and you know this God was the god of
[57:25] fertility
[57:27] then he meets Jezebel and Jezebel
[57:31] adorable
[57:32] worshiped this uh goddess assured
[57:37] Ash astroth the mother of all the gods
[57:42] but then God comes and says
[57:50] we're going to test the goddess
[57:53] and according to my words
[57:58] for three and a half years
[58:06] and make rain
[58:13] but nothing would happen nothing would
[58:16] happen
[58:18] there was three and a half years of
[58:20] drought
[58:21] wow
[58:23] everything foreign
[58:30] now look
[58:31] and it's a dimple and that time
[58:36] they lived off with the ground cave
[58:40] and for a consequence they needed water
[58:44] they weren't as we are in this time
[58:49] that maybe if I don't like what my
[58:51] mother cooked me what a Burger King
[58:54] Chick-fil-A no no no no no no
[58:59] they had to sustain them
[59:02] on what the ground gave them
[59:05] but the ground was dry
[59:08] there was not a drop of rain
[59:11] the skies were clean
[59:14] there was no signs of classes
[59:20] for the cause
[59:23] the sin of this King and of the people
[59:26] of Israel
[59:28] right
[59:32] I don't know if you have the pictures of
[59:35] the Gods
[59:42] that was uh
[59:44] garpeo
[59:46] I said yours
[59:47] this God
[59:50] is
[59:51] that's the guard they began to worship
[59:56] for them I was the god of fertility
[1:00:03] knowing who
[1:00:06] Jehovah was
[1:00:08] he turned his heart to these Gods
[1:00:11] the next picture
[1:00:20] the goddess of all gods
[1:00:24] the one Jezebel worshiped well let me
[1:00:28] tell you something
[1:00:30] there isn't anyone foreign
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:01:29] Branham says
[1:01:35] see what our brother Brandon says
[1:01:41] he was ahab's Pastor no no whatever
[1:01:47] referring to Elijah Elias includes
[1:01:50] Elijah was the pastor of
[1:01:53] ahabel he was the pastor of Jezebel yeah
[1:02:06] but he was a man that told her where she
[1:02:08] was living
[1:02:09] that's correct
[1:02:12] he was her pastor
[1:02:14] she hated him
[1:02:17] nevertheless
[1:02:22] he was the gift for her provider from
[1:02:25] God said tell her her sins
[1:02:27] and she failed to see it
[1:02:31] you know what I'm speaking about
[1:02:35] look
[1:02:38] forgive me for saying this
[1:02:40] is
[1:02:41] many times we come to church
[1:02:45] we don't take our pastors seriously
[1:02:52] many times
[1:03:02] how many believe that brethren
[1:03:05] but many times
[1:03:08] ignoramus we ignore them what God has
[1:03:11] given okay God puts in our mids
[1:03:16] continue saying and then Jesus came
[1:03:20] listen and Jesus Jesus
[1:03:24] was the gift of God for Israel Mundo for
[1:03:28] the world that's correct Jesus Jesus was
[1:03:33] God's gift
[1:03:35] for so God love the world I gave his
[1:03:39] only began
[1:03:40] you believe it
[1:03:43] soon
[1:03:46] we have a pastor moreover
[1:03:49] and he is named Jesus
[1:03:55] now look in that time this is dark
[1:04:03] a lot of people began to die
[1:04:07] or died of starvation
[1:04:11] and then here's a widow
[1:04:27] knocking at her door
[1:04:33] but God
[1:04:36] will never leave
[1:04:38] or never forget
[1:04:40] his seed
[1:04:45] s
[1:04:46] we want to close with this the musicians
[1:04:50] can come
[1:04:59] referring to the Widow brother Branham
[1:05:05] the Widow made the cake and gave it to
[1:05:07] the prophet is
[1:05:17] she made for her and her son and ate for
[1:05:19] many days
[1:05:21] where did that come from
[1:05:23] how did they get there
[1:05:26] referring to the cakes
[1:05:32] can someone scientifically explain where
[1:05:34] more flour and oil came from
[1:05:38] how they came into the vessels
[1:05:42] now like a Time came
[1:05:44] o
[1:05:46] where she only had a little bit left
[1:05:53] but when this Prophet Elijah came I hear
[1:05:56] you to her
[1:06:00] yeah she
[1:06:02] is
[1:06:03] could have more days to live and that
[1:06:07] God
[1:06:09] is
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:17] created the squirrels was that same guy
[1:06:22] that never let that vest
[1:06:24] that jar Sebastian be empty
[1:06:47] he can make your situation be a little
[1:06:49] difficult
[1:06:52] but if you take his word
[1:06:55] and you are certain that he is God
[1:06:58] foreign
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:30] cloudy Earth
[1:07:34] when you see the picture from a distance
[1:07:39] it seems like the most horrible thing is
[1:07:43] it's like if the clouds got mixed is
[1:07:48] you can see that from far but
[1:07:51] when you get close to the picture
[1:07:54] the picture changes
[1:07:59] and this is similar
[1:08:01] the picture is similar
[1:08:13] the same thing happens in the difficult
[1:08:15] times
[1:08:17] if you see the thing from a distance
[1:08:19] from Bria you will see a shadow
[1:08:24] but when you see God
[1:08:27] and you are certain years
[1:08:36] the Lord flapping his wings
[1:08:41] all of a certain time seems to be dark
[1:08:47] all of a sudden it seems we don't want
[1:08:49] this is
[1:08:51] being born in this message
[1:09:04] caliber

[1:11:01] the Widow
[1:11:04] just like Abraham
[1:11:07] was required
[1:11:10] or demanded to give everything they had
[1:11:14] and put it on the altar of sacrifice
[1:11:19] a little she had
[1:11:22] put it on the altar of sacrifice
[1:11:29] his son
[1:11:31] he was going to sacrifice
[1:11:34] the messenger says
[1:11:38] was picking up the fireworks
[1:11:43] I was attacked with the Lord Jesus
[1:11:45] Christ
[1:11:47] carrying his own sacrificial for his own
[1:11:50] sacrifice
