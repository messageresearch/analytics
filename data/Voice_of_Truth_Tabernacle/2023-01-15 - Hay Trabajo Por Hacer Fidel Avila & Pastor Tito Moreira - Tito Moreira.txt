[Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] oh yeah again [Music] Lord Jesus Christ uh is chapter one verse 2. first before you guys find the scriptures I would like to first thank God to allow us to use his pulpits and also to send a very special groups may God bless them um [Music] it captures my attention we see that it's got on the scene let's read Nehemiah 1. they say Manos hombres is one of my brethren came he insert men of Judah and I asked him concerning the Jews who had escaped who were left behind from the Captivity and concerning Jerusalem foreign he heard we're talking about a uh that is in your body he heard and sometimes by what we hear depends we're going to act according accordingly okay right uh who are left behind from captivity they're in the province or in great Affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire foreign certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of Heaven that's your word Lord help me Lord to be able to explain myself to be able to express who you placed in my heart and my brother's ears hear and meditate on the words this is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ remember we're speaking on the coming of the lord it's a very beautiful topic now that I was allowed to share I began to study a little more on this stop and the picture opens up foreign [Music] and that's why I said when when Nehemiah heard he didn't react the scriptures that his brothers now the question is why did Nehemiah cry [Music] are you doing well the walls were still destroyed sanctification okay there's work to do there's a very much work but the laborers here Brothers is that what Nehemiah heard he didn't say yes [Music] that captures my attention it's been a while since some of them had returned he grabbed it and took it is you individually it wants to react quickly my wife tells me I'm yelling too glory to God I just want to inject this here I want to express this I'm that way Brothers I'm not upset with you I love you yeah that's how I am God made me that way but I love you [Music] my intention is never to offend anyone but I just want to express that to you right now forgive me Brothers but God made me that way so what am I going to do Bueno yes forgive me Brothers it's good it's because when God comes to your life and you begin to reflect on your own life with the word of God you say I like very much I like a lot I'm the first sinner I'm the first one to fail uh and the Holy Spirit begins to put you in order Nehemiah began to cry a pastor says this is he says in the message let me tell you when Nehemiah cried because the walls were torn down and because the enemy was coming and he says something has to be done I think that represents place your name there yes the cry has already come on the word has already been revealed well the problem that we're struggling with okay una is because we're lazy in reading and two we don't ask for Revelation but he says God revealed to us his words but now you don't have to be restored to be able to stand against the enemy La Novia if we are the brideos for the last days we have to be ready to be ready to fight we also have to know ourselves we have to know the enemies but I also know myself foreign Cinco you have to care for these five senses because that's the windows that goes into the soul or to the spirit okay I'd like for you to understand that this is in the book of uh in the message Revelation chapter four ahora now there's one way to get into the body how's this body control look brothers look if you pay attention to this is why we're struggling because the devil goes in he enters why couldn't he go into Nehemiah why knew himself and you also have to know yourself to see how you're going to react he has a look now how is his body control now watch this real close and get your pencils ready here's the get on this side that goes into the body this is one two three four five now if the prophet's telling us it's for a purpose it's important it is important that we see this now the first grader was over here is La Vista it's the site smell in here and I like the hearing because Nehemiah he heard he didn't see usted we're here because we didn't even get to see brother Brandon but we here we're here and according to Luke Brothers the prophet says Dominion is when you control yourself your temper I mean that explodes my mind when self-control is so simple when you're able to control your mouth you control gossiping down to even gossiping their doors that the devil uses and sometimes we claim to be the bride when we're we're unpreneurs the walls are still down and the devil is entering but we're the bride already that makes me think that my wall it's still it's torn down but today he said like and and it says in the in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels you have to put yourself there brother that go inside of us or that lead to us now we have a soul after that that comes after this he's talking about the external here and inside of you Brothers managed to go the inside and the outside because just simply what you are inside it's where you are outside because that's what's on the inside right El Alma the first one is Imagination conscience Memoria memory reasoning and affection no I like imagination very much because I didn't start to imagine many things that could affected I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna relax I couldn't imagine that my brothers he's a moral being that's right I can't do everything they need help when we imagined so many dirties thinking wrong of one another that's imaginations directly to the soul and the soul hey here what is this word is the pastor says that the soul is the spirit of the spirit what we speak it is it's what you are we're going to show it his own brethreno we're building little by little that's right it was our bill from one day to the next yeah and I'm going to be closing with this my father he had a garden and I remember I was young and they began to build um you began to build like a fence of some sort got my attention that to be able to protect the Harvest that was on the inside there's a plant over there he had corn he had a lot of them there's a lot of produce and my father he grew that so that the animals wouldn't eat the produce the Harvest and I would like to bring this to us maybe we already overcame in something maybe we could say that we're comfortable in an area but let's take care of what we have because if we don't build up a wall because the war has to be at a certain height because if we leave the wall Too Short they're going to jump over is going to eat your Harvest we're gonna eat it and when you least realize it is you're in church as a trunk as a tree truck without fruit they seem like they just come off wrong to you stop would I care and let's Build That Wall let's build it high well the devil can't do anything to us we're brothers [Music] [Applause] and we went on that was very good how many love God's word let's read together [Music] the book of nemaya yeah we're studying the coming of the Lord today let's begin chapter two verse six Maya 2 6. so learn of God's word together go ahead and the King said unto him and it says in parentheses the queen also sitting by him repeat the queen also sitting by him next time Jesus Christ just as he's done in our time so everything happening in those final days what God is doing in our times a time of restoration not just anyone could have that status it was a very high position they have to be a very trusted forward but as we come to this we find out not only working for this purpose there's another character a woman actually named Esther Tiempo at the same time yes the book of Esther's afternoon chronologically Esther comes before nemaya and today between Entre is a particular story because many have controversy with the Book of Esther much things that sometimes don't make sense one of them is a the Book of Esther never mentions God's name foreign a month Chase Lou in the 20th year as I was intrition the palace where it was nemaya where was that was the capital of the Kingdom Now read Esther one one is the book afternoon Esther 1-1 they say this is asterisk that range from India even to Ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces when King sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushin the palace now where was Esther because all of the Book of Esther happens yes they're both around the same time Pueblo save the people of Israel to save his people I want to give more details but we're speaking of the same place now maybe a little different in times historians possibly josefo good some historians as Josephus and see this say that hazrus was artist Xerxes that he was the same simply a different name so now you see a different picture and the Bible says the queen was by his side and we realize many Jewish Traditions that was beside the king is that Queen Esther was still alive was that artist Xerxes yes whether it be artist Xerxes was a son or familiar or relatives or another son of another wife of a hazardous either way they on you Esther was Queen for a long time she continues being Queen either way Esther was Queen yes during that time is Xerxes she's not a scholar foreign perdon hello the church is a whole lot like it was the days with a crown on her head Esther was a type of the church those who are ready to come out with the sweetness implements our Lord that's right but in the beginning she didn't understand what she was called for foreign cuando a man when a malachite gave in order to kill all the Jews Ezra in the second Pole in Babylonia the Jews that were in babies not Babylon anymore they were going to kill them and this time Mordecai notices that was in Persia is he finds out and sends word to the queen that all the Jews would be killed did he say is King Esther said in first Queen Esther said in verse and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner core who is not called there is one lot of his to put him to death except search to whom the king shall hold out a golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come into in unto the king these 30 days they were going to kill them all celebrities Must Die foreign [Music] so this Kingdom for such a time is this yes that she says I'll do it into the king's chamber yeah foreign foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] we all know it certain places she defended foreign about the seals April 24 1963 when he began sorry when the coming of the Lord began in 1960. they asked him were the bride of Christ where the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the rapture vamos Iglesia come on Church how many are part of the problems before the rapture seguro she said foreign have a job to do she kept working the queen kept working yes she was a key part icles of the Reconstruction of Jerusalem very rare to mentioned Queens in the Bible that mujeres Queen's less women they're not mentioned the Lord Jesus Christ in the coming of the lord it's a key part in the coming of the Lord everything he has to now it's up to us they said it's our turn to do something the musicians can come you'll find it there you don't have to read it well he's speaking of the people in charge that's why we believe all of this was happening in the same time La Novia the bride doing her job saying there's more work to do the walls are broken Jerusalem is not what it could be bride is not what she could be yet I'm not what I could be um everything for you God won't do everything for you are you listening to everything foreign [Music] it would be someone that says Lord there's a lot of things broken in my life [Music] but there's no reason it needs to stay that way we have such a great job so mighty things don't have a reason to stay broken they don't have to stay with the Enemy entrando coming in foreign herself the bride helping the bride the bright helping them please stand [Music] [Music] I want to say this [Music] when he heard about the situation in Jerusalem reconcos was because if the walls were not rebuilt people wouldn't want to return to Jerusalem is Jerusalem was stolen ruins in the area that used to be Babylon that had not returned yet because Jerusalem was in Ruins I asked myself how many people today the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and they say that's the price that's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ is this it [Music] is and
