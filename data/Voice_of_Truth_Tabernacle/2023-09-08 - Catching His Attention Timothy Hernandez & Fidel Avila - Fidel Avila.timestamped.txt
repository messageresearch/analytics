[15:27] you have some specials tonight
[15:34] God bless you all
[15:37] I'm gonna try and be short and sweet
[15:42] um every time I've gone to Camp it's
[15:44] been a beautiful experience I've only
[15:46] gone twice but every time I've gone it's
[15:48] been beautiful
[15:55] I had a fight through a lot of loopholes
[15:58] to go this year
[16:02] I had a threaten to quit my job
[16:06] [Music]
[16:08] but there was a feeling in me that I
[16:10] needed to go
[16:15] I made it happen
[16:19] before Camp I was struggling a lot
[16:22] mentally
[16:25] I'm not going to get too much into that
[16:27] much
[16:30] I went with expectations
[16:35] and we got there it was beautiful
[16:39] service on
[16:41] Fridays but I felt my heart really
[16:44] really cold
[16:47] and I thought to myself you know how can
[16:49] God work with me if my heart's cold
[16:56] um so I sat on the sanctuary Friday
[16:58] night and I wrote a letter to God
[17:02] and I basically told him I don't want to
[17:05] leave this place foreign
[17:12] [Music]
[17:51] [Music]
[17:52] you can't control yourself control your
[17:54] body you can emotions
[17:58] and I thank God for giving me that
[18:00] beautiful experience
[18:04] um so I say you guys just continue to
[18:05] pray for me
[18:08] and for our beautiful youth because we
[18:10] need it
[18:16] [Applause]
[18:24] being that we have our brother Isaac up
[18:26] there
[18:32] I once heard this expression
[18:36] a blessing of God
[18:39] it's like if you're walking with 100
[18:41] million dollars
[18:44] and the whole world knows of it
[18:49] and they're going to do everything to
[18:50] snatch it from you yeah
[18:56] and knowing what we know is
[18:59] we don't fight against flesh nor blood
[19:04] against powers and spirits and
[19:11] this camp for me it was necessary
[19:14] foreign
[19:50] [Music]
[20:05] I can say so much but
[20:10] um I'll say this
[20:12] for many for a while
[20:15] I was living off of a painted fire
[20:18] yostava viviendo de unfuego pintado and
[20:21] I needed a real
[20:23] firego verdadero and I believe this Camp
[20:26] was my real
[20:28] firego verdadero like our sister Madison
[20:32] uh I also was getting cold
[20:36] and I was lying to myself for a while
[20:41] that I was actually in front of a fire
[20:43] okay
[20:47] but like our Pastor said on Sunday
[20:52] Our Lives is something else back home
[20:56] and I truly can say you overrated
[21:01] this Camp was something I needed it's a
[21:03] company
[21:05] to rekindle that which was once in my
[21:09] heart
[21:12] I thank God for that
[21:15] and I thank God for that
[21:18] uh
[21:19] well opening up the way to be able to do
[21:22] this
[21:25] God bless you
[21:29] [Applause]
[21:32] um
[21:57] I know there are a lot of Youth come
[21:59] back with the experience of the worship
[22:01] and the preaching book where I felt the
[22:04] poll was in the other activities at Camp
[22:08] comodios
[22:11] how God moved through my brother
[22:13] commodious
[22:16] and how God moved through the youth here
[22:20] um
[22:23] as you know we're seeing plenty as being
[22:25] youth
[22:27] um
[22:32] and this time I was able to see how our
[22:34] youth let go and worship God with all
[22:36] their hearts
[22:37] and that brought me so much joy
[22:54] that were bigger than just any youth
[22:59] we have something to show and we did
[23:02] isilosimos
[23:04] yes
[23:09] and my message is more for the Youth
[24:06] you all have something special and God
[24:08] will continue using you he Hermanos
[24:12] and brother pray for the youths
[24:15] because we can't do it alone
[24:18] [Music]
[24:20] um
[24:25] it's something very special if you have
[24:28] the chance to watch the video
[24:30] and see how they worship with their
[24:33] hearts
[24:36] and you can see what we're aiming at he
[24:41] and
[24:45] God bless you
[24:55] God bless you Brethren um
[24:59] first of all I want to thank God foreign
[25:48] [Music]
[25:56] I could let go of myself
[25:59] and I remember on Saturday
[26:02] it was a final preaching
[26:07] application and
[26:13] it wasn't that much so the preaching
[26:15] ended but um
[26:18] and I couldn't hold back from going to
[26:21] the altars
[26:22] [Music]
[26:24] and there I told God all of my problems
[26:28] to help me
[26:33] uh um
[26:36] that's where I began to worship God with
[26:38] all of my hearts
[26:42] began to jump and dance
[26:46] something I never do because
[26:52] I'm very serious I don't like to attract
[26:55] attention
[26:58] but to the youth that having gone
[27:01] I recommend you to go
[27:05] because for me was a great blessing
[27:09] I feel closer to God
[27:14] and up to this point he's helped me in
[27:17] my Temptation
[27:18] [Music]
[27:21] and as soon as I got back the devil
[27:23] began to tempt
[27:26] mejor but up so now I've been doing good
[27:32] and I give thanks to God because I
[27:34] couldn't do it on my own
[27:38] and I want to thank the youth leaders
[27:42] for all your hard work and taking us
[27:46] and watching us God bless you brother
[27:51] [Applause]
[27:57] God bless you
[27:59] um for me it was something very
[28:03] simple I guess my experience at Camp
[28:05] experience
[28:10] um
[28:11] it wasn't like
[28:13] I don't know it's like kind of hard to
[28:15] explain
[28:18] when I was there
[28:20] um I I kind of went to Camp like oh I'm
[28:23] expecting God to move in whatever way
[28:24] but he'll move in me
[28:31] and so I had scheduled or put myself for
[28:36] a special just me special
[28:42] and they told me like okay you're like
[28:44] number three on Friday the first service
[28:49] and so I kind of got nervous
[28:53] and to be honest in the past
[28:58] I wouldn't really get nervous
[29:01] but this time it was kind of like I
[29:04] didn't know why I was nervous
[29:07] lots of people would tell me well like
[29:09] you have a pretty voice so what are you
[29:11] worrying about
[29:15] it doesn't matter how you do it it's
[29:18] gonna come out
[29:19] bien
[29:23] but I had such a worry inside myself
[29:29] [Music]
[29:38] and before going up as I was hearing the
[29:41] other two specials before meant
[29:46] I could feel the power of God through
[29:49] those specials
[29:52] especiales and while the devil would
[29:54] come in me and just tell me why why
[29:57] would you even go up there if they
[29:59] already God moved through them
[30:05] and the main thing that the devil
[30:09] basically was telling me
[30:13] was that look they can bring power
[30:15] through their songs and
[30:20] I was sort of Downing myself
[30:23] [Music]
[30:33] it's almost like a sweet voice just told
[30:36] me
[30:39] just like reassuring me okay just
[30:48] Resto
[30:51] so I didn't care what happened through
[30:54] the songs
[30:57] I just saying and however it came out if
[31:00] nobody received from the crowd I
[31:02] received
[31:07] and so I kind of just held on to that
[31:11] assurance
[31:14] and so on Saturday
[31:19] um
[31:19] I I just you know I didn't care anymore
[31:22] about like a guy or whatever
[31:28] so I just you know I would just worship
[31:32] however I wanted
[31:35] just not caring what anyone thoughts
[31:40] I just wanted to worship my God
[31:45] and so
[31:48] I'm really proud also of our youth
[31:54] um when we sing like the presence of God
[31:57] was there like
[32:02] you know
[32:04] and when you could tell like I didn't
[32:07] know what I was doing during the the
[32:09] specials
[32:13] and like one of the sisters were like
[32:15] man you looked mad when you were up
[32:17] there
[32:20] so you know the presence of God was just
[32:22] there and it was even confirmed that the
[32:25] Holy Spirit was you know
[32:27] whatever my
[32:28] own foreign
[32:47] [Music]
[32:50] I see the Holy Spirit
[32:57] and so I've just been holding on to that
[33:00] or
[33:04] Laura
[33:07] and I just want to encourage the youth
[33:09] it's implemented
[33:11] that don't let the fire just burn out
[33:14] okay
[33:16] even if you can't explain how God moves
[33:21] that little planted seed is
[33:31] um so let's just keep finding a good
[33:33] fight yes
[33:38] [Applause]
[33:44] God bless you brother
[33:51] I have to testify of the Wonders that
[33:54] God does
[33:56] um
[34:02] I was very happy and with high
[34:04] expectations to go
[34:09] and the theme was desperation and the
[34:12] new birth
[34:15] I remember brother Junior Reese preached
[34:18] Saturday night
[34:22] he read a scripture Jeremiah 12. it is
[34:52] it's a come with expectation to those
[34:55] camps so it's just not a camp
[34:57] aign
[35:02] so brother would say I know tonight God
[35:05] is going to change lives
[35:10] and you ask yourself sometimes you want
[35:12] to see something great
[35:16] and you forget that God works in
[35:19] Simplicity
[35:24] and he would say I know that's going to
[35:27] happen because God is the same God today
[35:31] he's the same
[35:33] foreign
[36:01] [Music]
[36:36] I'm talking about the
[36:38] Chicken and the Egg is
[36:57] with his beak special
[37:04] and he says a very special Peak was
[37:07] given to him by God
[37:12] it says that if the farmer tries to go
[37:15] and help him
[37:18] he says don't try to go help him because
[37:21] you'll kill it
[37:24] so I was saying Lord that is all for me
[37:29] to see that for my family for my
[37:32] children
[37:36] so he's he would say you cannot help
[37:38] them
[37:40] that's a person an individual's case
[37:51] with that special beat that he was given
[37:53] by God he's going to come in desperation
[37:55] and he's going to come out
[38:02] because he helped me there and he said
[38:19] plenty of heat and plenty of love
[38:22] and motivated
[38:24] um
[38:26] to help it
[38:29] and I said thank you
[38:33] because that is what I needed
[38:37] and in Simplicity that's where God spoke
[38:40] and I give thanks to God for that and
[38:44] God bless you thank you
[38:52] God bless you
[38:55] um
[39:05] foreign
[39:08] maybe I was going with the odd
[39:11] expectations
[39:13] I'm not sure how to call it pero
[39:17] condo
[39:19] service when we got there Services began
[39:23] from Friday
[39:26] when God's presence was felt it is
[39:36] and I was so happy
[39:40] to see the rest of the youth
[39:43] the Youth of the local church
[39:46] because I said
[39:50] I want this Camp to be for me
[39:53] I want to give the best of myself
[39:58] and as the theme was desperation
[40:02] and I wanted to be desperate for my
[40:05] experience is
[40:16] seeking the same
[40:18] I don't know that comforted me okay
[40:23] they're also striving like I am yeah
[40:26] and you don't feel like you're the only
[40:29] one anymore
[40:34] and I think Saturday night was when God
[40:36] spoke to me the most
[40:48] in me
[40:50] Lord I want you more in me
[40:53] I want to fill you
[40:55] don't understand where are you
[40:58] no says
[41:03] what I heard them say yes I'm already in
[41:07] you yes
[41:09] and that's a joy
[41:12] I'm from there and on I continue to
[41:14] rejoice
[41:16] and that's my testimony God bless you
[41:21] [Applause]
[41:25] [Music]
[41:33] I had been carrying a burden for about a
[41:35] year in my heart
[41:36] [Music]
[41:37] um
[41:40] or a disagreement I had with some people
[41:44] um
[41:47] foreign
[41:56] [Music]
[42:11] that time that this happened
[42:14] um
[42:14] [Music]
[42:18] I was struggling with my walk with the
[42:21] Lord already
[42:24] so this did not help me
[42:27] um
[42:29] [Music]
[42:34] to Camp with an expectation I didn't
[42:36] know for what but I was just expecting
[42:38] anything
[42:41] it was Saturday night okay
[42:46] they did an altar calling pero
[42:50] yeah
[42:53] when I stayed in my seat meditating
[43:02] and at that moment uh it fell on me
[43:05] reality is
[43:10] you always hear that you should lay your
[43:12] burdens on God
[43:15] trusting him completely
[43:22] is
[43:24] but it's so hard to practice he
[43:28] foreign
[43:48] but after that I felt that burden I had
[43:51] left and I didn't feel anything else
[43:53] after that
[43:54] foreign
[44:02] for a long time and it was just a good
[44:05] relief to have
[44:07] um
[44:24] I
[44:28] was a little scared because
[44:33] they always say the devil's waiting
[44:35] outside
[44:37] so that doubt came in in me
[44:44] this is confessing and confirming um
[44:50] [Music]
[44:53] and that's it God bless you
[44:55] [Applause]

[51:19] you know it's a blessing to be here once
[51:21] again
[51:22] it's a blessing to be able to enjoy to
[51:25] come to service
[51:30] you know I I believe that it was a great
[51:33] blessing not only to them but to myself
[51:34] and I make this personal medicine
[51:38] you know and and
[51:41] you know but the devil Diablo you know
[51:44] we'll always try to take away that
[51:45] blessing from me
[51:47] you will always try to take away what he
[51:49] gave you
[51:51] what you asked foreign
[52:04] and as a subtitle we've placed it
[52:08] catching his attention
[52:10] now if I can place another
[52:14] subtitle to that is
[52:19] why wait
[52:22] you know because sometimes we're in a
[52:25] state of desperation foreign
[52:47] if we can please open our scriptures to
[52:49] Psalms 34.
[52:56] and it says like this
[52:59] I pray to the Lord
[53:01] and he answered me yeah
[53:04] he freed me from all my fears
[53:10] those who look to him for help will be
[53:12] radiant with joy let's give um
[53:18] no shadow of Shame will darken their
[53:20] faces
[53:22] in my desperation I prayed
[53:27] in my desperation
[53:30] I prayed
[53:32] and the Lord listened
[53:37] he saved me from all my troubles
[53:42] now one more scripture in Jeremiah 29.
[53:52] says like this
[53:55] for I know the thoughts that I think
[53:57] towards you
[54:00] now I want you to look at that word
[54:06] for I know the thoughts that I think
[54:08] towards you
[54:12] say it the Lord thoughts of peace and
[54:15] not of evil to give you an unexpected
[54:18] ends
[54:22] then ye call upon me that then shall ye
[54:26] call upon me and ye shall go and pray
[54:27] unto me
[54:32] and I will hurricane unto you
[54:36] to who
[54:39] to you to me on me and ye shall seek me
[54:44] and find me and as her brother stated in
[54:48] Camp
[54:49] there's only one condition
[54:53] because he says seek me and you will
[54:56] find me
[54:58] when ye shall search for me with all
[55:01] your heart is
[55:09] we give you thanks gracias Lord for
[55:12] allowing us to be here once again
[55:14] Lord I don't deserve I don't deserve
[55:18] your mercies
[55:19] I don't deserve anything Lord
[55:23] but yet you have me here
[55:26] with a purpose we have my brothers here
[55:29] with a purpose
[55:31] and Lord I ask that you may guide this
[55:34] service
[55:35] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:38] amen amen you may be Sierra brothers and
[55:41] sisters
[55:44] now the definition of desperation
[55:46] definition
[55:58] it's a complete loss or absence of Hope
[56:02] to lose or to be without hope
[56:06] to be hopeless
[56:08] how many here have felt with the
[56:10] desperation before
[56:13] I think we all have had a desperation in
[56:15] our life
[56:17] and if you haven't had a desperation
[56:19] well let me know the key is
[56:25] verse two oh sorry the second definition
[56:29] the feeling of being in such a bad
[56:32] situation
[56:35] that you will take any risk
[56:39] to change it now let me tell you tonight
[56:45] with God there is no risk
[56:48] with God you're not taking any risks
[56:52] and I make this personal for myself
[56:58] you know while I was in Camp um
[57:08] I I really wasn't expecting
[57:11] mucho I I was not certain if I was going
[57:14] to go or not
[57:19] but I ended up going you know of your
[57:22] free
[57:23] and
[57:25] the Friday service yes
[57:28] before I I before the the preaching
[57:32] started
[57:36] I don't just want this to be another
[57:38] Camp
[57:41] I don't just want this to be another day
[57:45] you know I want you your kiddo to help
[57:49] me get me I do this
[57:53] and in my mind
[57:56] I was like you know what I'm gonna
[57:57] actually pay attention to these
[57:59] preachings
[58:04] and Saturday night came along
[58:08] and that's that's when the Lord really
[58:11] touched my heart yes
[58:15] um
[58:19] because we we make it a routine brothers
[58:21] and sisters
[58:23] now we make it a routine to come to
[58:25] church
[58:27] Sunday Wednesday Friday Domingo
[58:31] but how is it that we're not in such a
[58:33] desperation for god
[58:36] brother Brown says you shouldn't be in a
[58:38] state of emergency to be in a
[58:39] desperation
[58:43] no desperation should be every single
[58:46] day
[58:47] this question shouldn't be to wait until
[58:49] until something bad happens
[58:58] and so Saturday night
[59:05] it was it was something different for me
[59:08] and I say this with my heart because
[59:14] um
[59:19] I really didn't care what anybody
[59:21] thought of me
[59:24] you know and going up to the altar yeah
[59:27] you know I I just left everything behind
[59:31] you know I just left everything and I
[59:33] was just like God it's just you and me
[59:34] right now
[59:37] God is just you and me
[59:40] you know so I talked to God
[59:43] you know and I believe that I will I
[59:45] received a blessing that night
[59:49] you know and then sometimes you could
[59:52] even say
[59:53] because the theme of that that that
[59:57] campamento you must be born again
[1:00:01] you know but even if you're not born
[1:00:03] again or you don't think you're born
[1:00:04] again
[1:00:07] the best that you're born again
[1:00:10] confess that you received your Holy
[1:00:12] Spirit
[1:00:14] and that's what it is that's what we
[1:00:15] have to do is to confess
[1:00:17] to confess what God has given us
[1:00:21] you know and and and and sometimes like
[1:00:24] I said Sundays Wednesdays and Fridays
[1:00:26] come along
[1:00:29] and as our brother said the definition
[1:00:32] of insanity is doing the same thing over
[1:00:34] and over and over and over again
[1:00:41] with no results
[1:00:44] how many here have gone through that
[1:00:51] you know and as as is in Psalms 34
[1:00:56] you know David found himself in such a
[1:00:58] desperation because
[1:01:05] trying to capture him
[1:01:08] you know but then he makes a song
[1:01:13] for what for when he says
[1:01:15] in my desperation I prayed
[1:01:19] and the Lord listened yes
[1:01:24] how many here pray every single day
[1:01:30] how many here meditate on him every
[1:01:31] single day
[1:01:37] you know another example is for example
[1:01:39] is
[1:01:40] The Story of Lazarus
[1:01:43] I like to read this quote
[1:01:47] then Jesus came and called
[1:01:54] first day pass second day pass Third Day
[1:01:56] passed
[1:02:01] the man was already running in his grave
[1:02:03] yes
[1:02:05] had already fell in
[1:02:09] and it's already rottening
[1:02:12] his flesh had gone back to the dust
[1:02:18] it was going back
[1:02:20] his soul was four days journey somewhere
[1:02:22] from him
[1:02:25] all hopes of ever seeing him again in
[1:02:27] this life was gone
[1:02:30] and then when all hopes was gone
[1:02:36] they waited
[1:02:38] maybe he'll come the first day
[1:02:42] second day
[1:02:45] then he died he hadn't come yeah
[1:02:50] the desperation set in La this is
[1:02:55] my brothers and sisters
[1:02:58] don't wait till the desperation comes
[1:03:01] to ask for God to ask God you know we
[1:03:05] should always be in a desperation every
[1:03:07] single day
[1:03:09] we shouldn't have to wait till the
[1:03:10] troubles come
[1:03:12] we shouldn't have to wait till the
[1:03:13] worries
[1:03:15] we should always be in a state of
[1:03:18] desperation
[1:03:28] and the message desperations
[1:03:32] he says
[1:03:35] I've heard people when when they know
[1:03:37] they were dying
[1:03:40] and the things that they kept secret all
[1:03:42] their life
[1:03:44] they in desperation
[1:03:47] they were trying to confess
[1:03:51] and try and take this and that and make
[1:03:53] it right go please go
[1:03:55] dot
[1:03:59] see in desperation they
[1:04:03] ought to have done that beforehand
[1:04:06] see now wait till the time of emergency
[1:04:11] will you do so and so for me
[1:04:14] the emergency causes desperation when we
[1:04:17] ought to do it
[1:04:20] without being in the state of emergency
[1:04:28] and I believe that God blesses us
[1:04:33] when we go into a state of desperation
[1:04:36] looking for him
[1:04:38] asking more of him
[1:04:44] I believe us youth we received a
[1:04:46] blessing at campus
[1:04:49] I believe we did
[1:04:53] but the devil is always going to try and
[1:04:55] take that blessing away
[1:04:59] let me tell you he hasn't stopped till
[1:05:01] after after I left campus
[1:05:06] my head started hurting
[1:05:11] I started to go
[1:05:14] sit down with her I really received a
[1:05:17] blessing
[1:05:19] but let me tell you
[1:05:22] if you believe in a god
[1:05:24] you believe in An Almighty God
[1:05:28] the power
[1:05:32] um
[1:05:40] then what wouldn't he do for me
[1:05:45] you know we really have to make a
[1:05:46] personal presence
[1:05:49] you know we have to go into a state of
[1:05:51] desperation
[1:05:53] we have to be looking for him day and
[1:05:56] night
[1:05:57] and is it easy yes I
[1:06:02] I'll be honest I don't do it every
[1:06:03] single day
[1:06:04] you know but there's something inside of
[1:06:08] me
[1:06:09] that tells me I have to keep going I
[1:06:13] can't give up
[1:06:17] I want God to use me
[1:06:24] in the same message aspirations
[1:06:29] he says now I believe that we're living
[1:06:30] in the days that we're otherwise the
[1:06:33] days that we're living in should cause
[1:06:34] the church to go into a completely into
[1:06:36] a desperation is
[1:06:46] now I want you to make this personal
[1:06:48] tonight
[1:06:49] I believe since the message this morning
[1:06:54] I believe since the message the last
[1:06:56] Sunday that brother of Titus preached
[1:06:58] this is
[1:07:00] I believe since Wednesday
[1:07:05] I believe it ought to throw this entire
[1:07:07] congregation into a desperation
[1:07:11] that we have played long enough
[1:07:15] that we have played long enough
[1:07:18] we've went to church long enough
[1:07:21] we've got to do something
[1:07:24] we need to do something for God
[1:07:26] don't wait for another Camp to come
[1:07:30] don't wait for the right moment to come
[1:07:34] wait for the moment
[1:07:37] the day can be your day
[1:07:41] and sometimes we need to completely give
[1:07:44] ourselves out yeah
[1:07:51] we got to do something we got to do
[1:07:54] something for the glory of God
[1:07:56] we can stay in the same condition
[1:08:00] we can stay in this
[1:08:03] run condition if I can put it this way
[1:08:10] you know but I believe it also requires
[1:08:12] a little bit of Faith
[1:08:18] you know it's your faith it's your
[1:08:22] belief that Jesus
[1:08:24] that Jesus did something for you
[1:08:34] you know why don't you ask yourself this
[1:08:36] question tonight
[1:08:37] I leave my brother
[1:08:40] uh
[1:08:46] not a question
[1:08:48] not a question a statement um
[1:08:54] Lord I need you to come into my life
[1:09:07] thank you
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:11] Elizabeth God bless you Brothers
[1:09:16] before beginning I'd like to thank
[1:09:23] Como
[1:10:23] David
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:45] the heart
[1:10:47] to leave your homes
[1:11:01] the life of a Christian has become
[1:11:05] a person takes it lightly
[1:11:11] I was thinking of meditating on the
[1:11:13] theme a little bit
[1:11:14] I'm going to be answering it to my
[1:11:16] message
[1:11:39] you can't do anything
[1:11:41] yeah you can do something as well
[1:12:24] and Jesus passed by
[1:12:49] it hit me in my heart
[1:13:48] that they strive to enter
[1:14:19] [Applause]
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:49] nobody want to draw near to me
[1:15:09] God in you
[1:15:22] the signs of his coming should drive
[1:15:24] every member of Christ to despair now
[1:15:27] for our souls
[1:15:32] Brothers I see the church very calm
[1:15:35] I see them very cold
[1:15:38] that's fine I won't force it is
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:16:03] our well-being hereafter
[1:16:08] I don't know if you've caught this
[1:16:10] Brothers
[1:16:19] but why aren't we in a desperation for
[1:16:22] him
[1:16:33] because I'm thinking more about myself
[1:16:36] I'm thinking more about myself
[1:16:39] than in the others
[1:16:43] says
[1:16:47] this is
[1:16:51] usually takes a state of emergency
[1:16:54] to drive us to a desperation
[1:17:31] kill yourself
[1:17:54] because that doesn't happen
[1:17:58] then we're just still on call
[1:18:02] one more day
[1:18:05] one more day in church
[1:18:08] one more week okay oh how miserable how
[1:18:13] miserable
[1:18:15] to live day by day is
[1:18:20] he said
[1:18:23] what good does it do if we win the whole
[1:18:25] world
[1:19:03] in the glory of God
[1:19:06] foreign
[1:19:07] things
[1:19:15] they say
[1:19:16] it says
[1:19:21] what are you living foreign
[1:20:04] will it do
[1:20:07] oh Brothers
[1:20:10] what are you living for
[1:20:14] eign
[1:20:16] what are we living for brothers
[1:20:30] there's something greater than that
[1:20:32] I'm going to be closing with this
[1:20:36] a job that was found there
[1:20:40] Joe Brothers
[1:20:44] he went through the three uh stages of
[1:20:48] Grace
[1:21:09] there was his justification he was
[1:21:13] justified there
[1:22:00] he was still a sinner
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:23] the same way
[1:22:27] thank you
[1:22:30] a prophet says
[1:22:32] when he heard oh Brothers
[1:22:36] when Jacob heard that his brother was
[1:22:40] coming to kill him
[1:22:49] he began to win he began to cry
[1:22:54] death was drawing close to him
[1:23:08] that's not needed
[1:23:12] we go to it
[1:23:15] yeah let's control and he heard
[1:23:19] was coming to kill him he was
[1:23:22] approaching him
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:26] but he knew he continued to walk the
[1:23:29] same still
[1:23:30] he was still Jacob he walked in the same
[1:23:34] manner
[1:23:35] he was he was
[1:23:37] a Deceiver
[1:23:45] he realized
[1:23:48] that he was naked
[1:23:54] that he was naked
[1:23:57] he was lacking something
[1:24:06] yeah
[1:24:10] he was lacking a typo
[1:24:13] he was lacking an anchor yes
[1:24:18] oh he was scared
[1:24:27] he
[1:24:30] was fearful

[1:26:39] your life
[1:26:42] if we depart like this we won't make it
