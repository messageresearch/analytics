Matthew chapter 6 verse 21 what a beautiful song I hope that their heart that sounds like our hearts and prepare us for what God has for us this morning okay the Holy Ghost descends it reads like this is for where your treasure is there will your heart be also you may be seated este Pastore with our pastor replace the title let go to obtain is I believe we're living in a Time donde where we've been offered very much it's made it very difficult to let go of things because they're nice things that the devil offers us they're nice things I believe that the devil offers us on this earth that is his job but I also believe everything on this Earth we're gonna go in little by little to begin where is my heart where is my heart this is the side of my heart if you ask yourself what's your heart he wants to live in our hearts and what the devil is where we make our choice [Music] that's what moves us that's what moves now when God sees that Brothers when God sees that is God is a very jealous now God is because God loves it in that such a way we have to make our choice what God has for me amen Brothers okay okay let's read a little bit in the Book of Matthew chapter 19. foreign we're going to read verses 19 and 20. this is the story of the Russian rules I believe that there's something inside of this is a young man this is he was a religious person um uh he was somebody who was content who was happy [Applause] but within him then within him there was a void there was an Empire emptiness inside of this young man when he explained to us they imagine of every time he hurts got something within his heart a desire to know I believe that within history that he wanted something he had to realize yeah Nosotros we could feel underst we could feel a rest yes that is why we come together foreign this young man had a reverence he was a sincere man because he felt empty or he felt that fall he felt guilty meet him now look Brothers he's speaking of we're speaking of a purpose that is the theme all of this is going to pass away all of this will pass away of course we need it they have to have contacts but this isn't what's going to give us eternal life eternal life is [Applause] because this young man was given the opportunity amen Brothers but he had a great problems because we all have problems but not just because we care for them does it mean that we have to obtains no brothers this young man he came to the Lord Jesus he and when he heard now you know brothers that God searches our hearts right see yes God is searching our hearts this morning in my heart this morning foreign [Applause] [Music] all of my heart it makes me happy like the word of God does amen I tell it to you from the bottom of my heart yes they make me suffer Brothers I cry more yeah you're on and I'm a crybaby as it is brother Samuel says if you see the kids are crying baby you go over there I'm very sentimental glorious and glory to God Brothers but now when the Lord Jesus Christ told us your man he was searching his heart [Music] he had seen what was uh what was hindering him and he told us you've done everything Cristiano you're a good Christian s i sweep my mom for the church I cook [Music] I am so ready come take me Lord I am so tired I'm also sleepy Hermanos if you want to be asleep and not wake up there's a reality amen Brothers now look when God searched this young man's heart he told him Let It Go es now perhaps for this young man it was his reputation how he was going to give everything in and um abundance Brothers sometimes we think that when we give a thousand dollars when the Son of God gives God gives you a double when Elijah when Elijah Brothers and when you give to God God gives you more that is our God now you is only you can see your heart you know what you're struggling with it and that is what God wants you to let go of it you guys giving us the opportunity this morning to let it go but God is not going to force you meet it God love this young man God loves you this morning God loves me it's important it's important to know that Brothers to know that God loves us but God wants us to let go to be able to obtain that's right what he possessed was what possessed him what he possessed was what possessed him do you see brothers look at me what binds me is what I don't want to let go of it's looking that's what kills me is but the word of God says it's time to let it go let it goes and I've decided to let it goes to let go of all of this world to let it all go it's worth it God called you to be a leader and God sent you Bruno in the ninth hour there was a crippled man there from birth a lame man ero he was asking for money they looked into his eyes and they kept looking at him dinero they didn't have money had the Holy Ghost had everything inside that they offered this young man Brothers why do we go so far that is what I need Gloria glory to God Brothers meeting look at I'm going to finish with this and the message straight is the gate he said no I know that you think that I'm a hard person I'm not hard brother Brown I'm your brother and I love you you see that's what God does that God shows us his love so we should do the same this is an anger that was pure amen they say this is I love you this is the Wrath that is go to the cross and cry until your heart is Christ is not a duty it's a lot of services so God has foreign foreign [Applause] is to become rich so it appears as though that's their purpose foreign foreign foreign it's more than just dollars foreign but it's very difficult right on one occasion the Lord presented himself to the prophet Isaiah and he presented to him presented himself in chapter six to him we won't read it and he asks him this question who shall go Canada who will go which one of us believe it's the same question we will go to do what needs to get done in Phoenix in the city of Phoenix and God asked who shall go shall go make an impact and God asks Isaiah and I ask you if I asked why did he ask him in chapter six that he had to let go what he saw in a case named uh um so this chapter begins with the death of uziah because he had to let go of that friendship yeah things of this world the things of this world keeping you bound s you will not be able to serve me because that goes to war entangles himself with the businesses that he may please him with who hath chosen him to be a soldier now brother Marshall was speaking on this uh Richard ruler Dios de niago God has something more for him God wanted to use them in a greater way he knew there was something better because we know there's something great God can use you more than you can imagine foreign God can use money there are people that have nothing and they have a love towards money or the material things God is instructing Timothy through the Apostle Paul the Como service how to serve like a true servant of God he says but godliness with the contentment is great first Timothy 6 6. foreign foreign [Music] Amanda who wants to use us monkeys so with their Educational Systems and things of this day but it's not so there's an investment that gives us a greater gain yes and that is is to put it all in the hands of God Jesus Christ from a child [Music] negotios it's my it's it's pertains to me to be about my father's business we're the ones that don't want to let it go es God wants to free us from what has us bounds but it's us but don't let that go in order to obtain the other I want you to let go of your possessions foreign people would rather have possessions than experiences [Music] rest of your life you could possess Ed what good does it do for you and you have an experience of misery [Music] he is in misery let go what you possessed I will give you a real experience we don't have golders Hallelujah foreign [Music] my what others have idios and God will give you what's yours because somebody will always have more than you forgive me hello so it's it's a hole without an end that this whole does not have an end the more you want but if you let go of wanting what others have God will give you what belongs to you impression if you let go of wanting to impress [Music] God will give you the the power to impact people focus on impressing isn't that right they don't even impress very much Impressions that impresses me more yourself [Music] I like them Lord Jesus Christ that would make a difference in the world never about you is change the lives that yes you let go of the distractions you know technology having the the most up-to-date things looking at the new things just a bunch of distractions but if you let it go God will give you something he will give you a purpose occupied for the rest of your life the second that you live for that it will it will be worth it hold of eternal life you have to let go of the rest say I can't two masters but you use it for the kingdom of God use it for yourself to fulfill your own desires you're using God's money what you have need of that's why Paul tells Timothy having enough to eat into where that should be enough in other words he's saying having a food and Raymonds he'll give you what you need to have a clothing is to have a security to be safe in other words you're not in danger and then having what you need that's more than enough happy fulfilling God's purpose let me tell you something this is the world has brainwashed us it has a serving money for everybody Gloria to the glory of God this is yours he says God cradled him in his arms cradled him in his arms I see the glory of Gods Matthew 6 19 says we have not your Treasures upon Earth where Martin Russ does corrupt this a he is and where thieves break through and steals lay up your Treasures in Heaven is where thieves do not break through and Norse and here's the verse there were your heartbeat also God needs a surrendered heart to him so in order for him to use it there's no other way Brothers thank God to give you your vision and purpose Hallelujah dinero gonna forever money as a trial that's in your heart yes it's a test God uses money the way we use money he sees what's in our hearts [Music] God doesn't need our money he doesn't need our money but he needs he needs sons and daughters that are giversity God does not need our money this is a servant of God the daughter of God give themselves a person that is greedy foreign [Music] to give noise it's not in order for God to greaten his finances or make them more it's the way he uses to to make his children greater in English I would say it this way giving is not God's way of raising funds um it's God's way of raising children that's the way God will form your character every time I guess I'm Letting Go a little more of my my selfishness letting go of a little more of my greens every time I give Carlos I'm saying it's greater than the money mefendios what God has for you the Lord wants my heart not my money but that's how he has it in your heart when when you let go the Bible says if you're not even faithful with money this includes all the materials with that you won't be faithful in the spirituals the Bible says that God will not give you what is real you can't serve both foreign and your heart will be there we don't do more for God because we walk for money buy money buy money if I don't have money I won't go I mean the greedy one isn't the one that just has money the ones that are greedy the ones in other words agreed not just the money the possessions then we won't go good job God will provide you don't have to worry Church here we go yes and there's others that don't want to sacrifice there's some that don't do anything because they say they don't have anything that don't do anything because they don't want to sacrifice what they have the more we have sacrificio the greater the sacrifice foreign the more things are holding us back it's hard it's harder to sacrifice you think somebody that lives on a Bed of Roses go sleep on a bed a hot bed it's hot it'll be hot at night they say well I'm okay it's kind of hard to serve God the reason is because you have a lot he didn't have a place to lay his head on the fox has had more than him that's what he said they had more than he did the more we have the less we want to sacrifice what happens we die with our money like the richest without doing anything for God says lean on to thy own understanding this is you know we get up here as ministers we're always giving out to the people everything that's in us I preached the subject one time where Jesus said are they neither toil or spinning yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like one image [Music] to make itself he opens up they say is to smell the perfume from him the biggest the honey right out of the heart gives everything out that he toils to take it and I call my message ministers give themselves and it's good then just to sit down we like to sit under each others grateful to have this opportunity to do that the musicians can't come forward they were sharing with brother Branham about the first church and how did they they sold everything have you read the book of Acts have you read the book of Acts it says that they sold it all right no I'm not asking you to sell everything before you get scared what a mistake that they made why did they sell everything persecution came they didn't have houses or anything they didn't have a place to hide but brother says when the persecution came in order to disperse or spread the message to places throughout the world because they didn't have anything to hold them back let me tell you well they don't have anything to hold them back when you've lost it all when you have nothing to say this is mine then God can use you then God shows you what you were made for Paul said I all have it as well again over there in eternity it has nothing to offer me oh Brothers [Music] there's nothing wrong with having things the problem is we're so greedy and the Bible says that the greedy will not enter because God can't use them the little that we have we want to is we don't use it for God's Kingdom [Music] Lord I don't have anything to lose all I can take is what I did for God I don't have anything to lose the money that you have in the bank [Music] the the economists if the economy fails only ten percent of what's in the bank truly exists the rest is all digital what we have but okay but what I have in heaven is greater than anything we have on this Earth how many Souls have you impacted how much has your life done for someone something somebody else how much do you have in glory foreign [Music] letting go [Music] [Music] are willing to let go how many want to be used by God Brown says about Stephen this is that man knew what he was talking about the customers they knew what he was believing in he knew what he was believing in is that small little fellow he raised up and said yesterday I see Jesus standing at the right hand of God when the Clause was beating his little brains I don't believe he fought the lick of it God had him huddled into his arms he impacted that man had upon his life Paulo Paul he's not Jesus in that man [Music] you say well I have a lot of things but how many Souls do you have how much have you done for God that's what's gonna be worth anything in the end please stand there are people that love the material things without having them and there are people that have the material things without loving them the more you use it for God the easier will be for God to give to you because he knows what you're using it foreign sorry you know just have a Pequeno and I was uh young I was a child I grew up poor we probably very poor Burger King once a month we'd go to Burger King when the government would help us that was a great event for us yeah I would always say I'm gonna give it all I got I want to do something on this Earth [Music] in the high school I was the best in my class in middle school and high school [Music] something happened in my heart [Music] I knew I could have made a lot of money [Music] I know I could have made a lot of money [Music] but it got to the point where I realized that that won't make a person happy but like brother Brandon says when he saw Souls on the altar IO [Music] a woman was asking him what makes you happy this is what makes me happy this is what brings me joy [Music] I I have as well [Music] for something of this world after your Birthright [Music] the time I have left [Music] I want to fulfill my purpose I want to do something for the glory of God [Music] I want to be somebody for God not for this world but I want to use what he has given me for his honor and His glory I was telling the Lord in these days [Music] to do something more for you and God said let go in order so that I could use you you have to let it all go [Music] someone else here that needs to let go or is it just brothers [Music] is there somebody here that needs to let go in order for God to use you let go of those things they have you bound let him go and God will be able to use it give them to God God bless you deserve the glory
