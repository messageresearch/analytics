[Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Music] is [Music] a [Music] we [Music] [Music] as you are standing can you please accompany me to psalms 56 11. we give thanks to god in god i have trusted i will not fear what can man do to me is also if we can go to the scripture exodus 14 9. we're speaking on moses and the deliverance from of the people of israel from egypt exodus control therefore the egyptians with all the cavalry and chariots of pharaoh his horsemen and all his army overtook them and camped by the sea next to paiha hakhira in front of balse is and when pharaoh had drawn near the children of israel raised their eyes and behold the egyptians were coming after them therefore the children of israel were greatly afraid and cried out to the lord and they said to moses were there no tombs in egypt that you have brought us out to die in the desert why have you done this to us that you have brought us out to eat out of egypt foreign it's not this when we spoke to you in egypt saying let us serve the egyptians because it would be better for us to serve the egyptians than to die in the desert and moses said to the people fear not stand firm and see the salvation that jehovah will do with you today because the egyptians that you have seen today you will never see them again forever then the lord said to moses why do you cry out to me tell the children of israel to march and you raise your rod and extend your hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel will enter through the middle of the sea and drag on dry ground if we complete our heads your heavenly father we give you thanks lord lord may you open our ears in our understanding of our brothers so that they may be able to discern and if something air comes out of my mouth may they be able to rebuke it lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated as a title romano marcial brother marshall fernando fernando we decided to bring out moses and all the people of egypt moses had the israel moses had the commission to bring their people out of egypt god had commissioned him and he backed him up moses was the and to bring things to existence and the burning bush the pillar of fire throughout the night the people of israel and moses believed in egypt how much they had progressed in their faith now moses was the man of faith god and we can separate the scriptures just a little bit in the version moses said to the people fear not stand firm and see the salvation that jehovah will do with you today because the egyptians that you have seen today will never see them again forever jehovah will fight for you and you will be calm moses being of israel to march and the preaching i had heard but now i see in 65 see moses in the crisis cried out and we find out in exodus the 14th chapter and the 13th chapter to the 16th verse moses in that big squeeze there with the children of israel's inspiration stuck him struck him and he said that he had to say not knowing that he had to say it see stand fast and see the salvation of god so you stand firm and you will see the salvation of god because the egyptians whom you have seen today you'll never see again they said why'd you bring me out of egypt where there are no tombs over there nostra history god he was inspired and said stand firm and you'll see the salvation of god because the egyptians we have seen today you will never see them again how did he know that that was going to happen he did not know what he spoke of that was god speaking through music he said take out your staff and stretch it out and stretch out your hand over the c and tell the children to march and sometimes they say number three the inspiration that's how it impacts you if you're sick that's how it impacts you if you're afflicted something is real to you and you see it revealed and you say i've been healed today then god tells him what what to do get up and start walking amen it's all over when you can do it that way that's how god does it so you can see god manifesting himself through you puedios it was god who told him to do it now everyone that was present that was present and that pillar of fire led them across the scene i heard about god but then they saw it and how many of us have seen god how many of us have seen god in our lives he was given a dry staff mostly staff represents many things among one of those things i want to take this is fight always it was not the right of moses the australian he says god had moses in his hands and what that was in moses hands [Music] god's promises are at everyone's reach [Music] promises even though we may not understand all the mind of god we can say that the bride can understand the mind do maybe you can see i'm not a prophet hey i'm not a teacher no i don't have a great title but you have the word you have to promise because and regretfully we sometimes reject it because we can't see how god works but let's give thanks to god for this a message and a prophet just grab hold of the words that see in front of you remember he didn't give you the promise today before the foundation of the world amen and god bless you man amen what beautiful word how beautiful and when pharaoh drew 9 the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord they every day difficulties every day we go through fears every day we go through temptations every day they they're scared [Music] and they began to remember and that happens to [Applause] or drinking except that acceptance or etc many times that's what happened to afghans that we think we're going to be better the way we were perhaps right now what we see is only that that there's no way out the children they found the reds they saw the red sea and they didn't find a way out and here the people of israel found themselves with a beautiful party is that god tells moses everyone begins to cry why do you cry speak habla speak and he spoke bro and what happened brothers you spoke the word of god the i don't know where to go i but we don't what i'm in the same world is is a little bit of dirt you can ride can flow and bloom look brothers we're not playing church necesitable what god has sent us out to do man and just as i speak that's how my battles are brothers and now you know why i speak the way i speak much man many know my story he says he's calling and that's where god wants to take us brothers amen brothers meet it look and moses knew that god had sent him he just said lord he fell in the doorway of the tabernacle separate yourself a disguise is you don't do things porque yes now don't stay in just come on the word of god didn't many times we think that the situation we find ourselves in yo that god said he would be with you and the problem would just vanish that's a great problem that god does things in his life and he says each one of them made the same thing they all dance in the spirit they all had everything in common but when it came time to separate the word brothers separa it separates it separates us it separates us from it it separates us because we have to separate ourselves you have no luck he wants to shut us up one way or another but he's not going to shut us up he's not going to quite continue speaking of the word of god and we're going to continue going forward fernando esperando brother fernando we're waiting for you because i'm not i'm going to continue hermanos brothers it's time to act on testimonial here i'll leave

lord said to moses why are you crying out to me tell the israelites to move on erase your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the israelites can go through the sea on dry ground we're under the the title it's time to act it's time to advance is they take it easy [Music] but and she she told me this the story of her life i like the time the title of her life she said i don't have the time to waste time sometimes we come to church it's just to waste time with the incorrect spirit does god you knew this this tie was from uh from the girl from the second-hand
