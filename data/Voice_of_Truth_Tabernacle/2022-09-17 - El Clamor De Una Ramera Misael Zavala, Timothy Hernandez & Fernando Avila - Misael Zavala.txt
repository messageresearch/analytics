place oh and break down the wars that surrounds us as we give you praise [Music] of god why don't you move in this place [Music] and the walls that surrounds us as we give you praise [Music] open your bibles to the book of joshua chapter 2 verse 1. for allowing us to borrow his pulpit my name is other brothers that are watching us through the internet california from california mexico and other places and joshua the son of none sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into and harlot's house named rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there come men in hitherto night of the children of israel to search out the country and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into in-house for they became to search out all the country and the woman took the man and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but i wish not once they were done and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men when i what not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof our heads please celestial name of your son jesus christ amen amen you may be seated israel establishes a israel the bible says was in chatim before crossing the the jordan river jericho almost in front of jericho este pueblo de jerico this town of jericho had heard of all the miracles that god had done for the people of israel jericho began to panic there became a spirit of fear that went over them allowed by god because the bible says that god always goes before us of all those who believe him and they stand for him they had seen the miracles that god had done they had defeated the two kings of the amorites how he but i want to focus on a youth a young lady named rahab a prostitute he was a prostitute a harlot a person who has a sexual relations for money or for another benefit she was a young a young person she had also heard of the miracles god had done right [Music] i can see you farther on a little after she had got her first hearing of israel and of a god who was a god that answered prayer not only a god to pray to but respond but a god that answered back when she heard that there was a god of miracles who could perform miracles algo something was coming yeah and she knew it she knew that it was a god so powerful that he could take that city many of us that come from the streets that come from outside yo yo experience i had those experiences god began to do things in my life before i even came to church i didn't even go to church one day two representatives came to jericho and quickly her on the street as a prostitute she called them took them into her house they're after the word of god says that they only went to iran even though their way of dressing was different and i also believe that they they walked differently and she received them and she waited uh from some uh for something from god because god doesn't stay with nothing you know in matthew 10 41 in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward so she's seeing something different in these two men god always works the same in the temple in the time of moses he sent moses to preach before he destroyed in the temple in the time of noah el mangano he sent noah before and this if he was going to if he was going to destroy then why would he send two two spies to preachers because god knew that there was seed there a via alien question there was someone that was crying in that hall in the heart in the heart of a harlot those two ministers when moses and joshua were on the road to the wilderness coming to the exodus they sent out some ministers spies to go spiral to land and remember there was a gentile over on the other side of the river by the name of rehab she was a harlot poor kid was a street walker perhaps turned out by her family and she wanted to know if there could be any mercy could be granted to her so when they went into her home they began to preach she didn't ask how handsome he was i forgot a point when she seen these two men in la calle in the street although she had this office this job she didn't seduce them to have an opportunity god had revealed to her they were men of god there was no need to do anything it says and when she got the first message from the two preachers that went over quickly she accepted it with all her heart hey i know she didn't doubt she didn't put her home or her people before them not even her own family and god will reward us one day and there was a scarlet cord bound at her window for protection of her house because she had received the message it was a guarantee that god was giving her just as he gave it to israel there back in egypt the sign of the blood on their doorposts and this was simply because she had believed it doesn't matter what you're struggling with doesn't matter the spirit you're struggling the bad life that you're leading mercy from god here in the same message the prophet says did you know she typed the gentile church until she was a gentile she was a i've had a new opportunity and i could grab it even though my hands were dirtied i could see paul that he had a new opportunity and you can have a new opportunity today not mattering all of it [Applause] god bless your brothers and sisters um uh rahab believed in a god that she didn't put anything other else before god you know and like he said we're all found in a spiritual prostitution you know message to take for all of us to get closer to god how many come prepared tonight or how many how many came to sleep you know i think we should all take another step closer to him every single day a prostitution in other words you know and i looked at the definition of a prostitute and of course as we all know is to sell to sell your body for money but one of the definitions that really caught my eye it says to devote to corrupt to the vote to corrupt your unworthy purposes to devote to corrupt or unworthy purposes improposito yeah and and it really caught my attention because you know there's things that we do every single day you know that are corrupt you know that are unworthy that purposes that are unworthy you know and this harlot this this ray hasta ramirez you know as we as we begin to read in chapter two that she heard now of the miracles of how god took them out of israel of egypt it says now remember she uh she was like where have the harlot this little woman was she never seen a miracle she'd only heard about america ohio you know when the spies come over she didn't have to say i'll tell you you bring josh over here and let him hold a service for me and i'll see whether i can accept him or not she said i have heard that the god of heaven was with you yeah god doesn't see your condition you know he god himself became flesh you know to be able to understand us as humans you know so if if god can understand us he can understand what you go through you know but it's no one's perfect is perfecto no one here is perfect you know but if we can just say lord give me mercy lord i want you to look around and you see all these people here you know we're all walking miracles and josue dos verse 11 capitulo and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither neither did there remain any more courage in man because for you for the lord your god is the god of heaven above and in the earth you know as as i've read chapter two you know i i could see a believer you know even though her past past that she was forced into pasado just by hearing and we know that that that faith coming by hearings you know i see a gentile like a method of presbyterian like anything that she could have just been anything else uh romans 10 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved you know and that's what rahab did yesterday no she said lord i'm nothing lord i'm nothing without and the world passes away and the lust thereof he that doeth the will of god abideth forever you know you know she knew that those men that came in you know and the only thing she wanted to know brother ben says if there could be any mercy granted to her yeah says god gives mercy to those who call for mercy all that call for mercy shall receive mercy you know god cares for each and every one of us here tonight there's still hope for you you know there's still mercy i missed you know and i think we should call for that you know because one day that direct line with god that we have salinas will one day go away and the message he cares do you care important he so cared even for a woman that was an outsider not an israelite she didn't belong to the group but she was an outsider presbyterian methodist or something she was on the other side but when she heard name was rahab she was living she was a harlot but when she heard how god was in the pillar of fire and was leading them she said let she said let called out to god and she showed mercy to the spy that i came to look out the land but because she had seen the sign of a supernatural god and she served her god's writing her own denominations but when she saw that great supernatural sign denomination an outsider she was in the group that time but he cared he always cares he cared for elijah when he when he alone cared for god how many care for god cuantos you know could god care so much for you you know if if you can tell me a point of your life where god hasn't been present then i want to hear it you know god has been there at every single moment [Music] and in case you didn't know he's still there elsia god cares so much for us brothers in in the message of the token mensah it says notice this harlot she said i'll show kindness watch she didn't have to see joshua she didn't have to see the way he combed his hair or the clothes he wore she said i have heard that god is with you that's all she wanted to know observe el cabello oh what kind of clothes you wear what kind of phd you have i hear that god is among you that's the main thing we want to know where god is among them watch the organization look where they're going to last organizations is god among the organized organizations then he is leading them straight to the council of churches and back to the mark of the beast god is not that entonces god is for both her and her family foreign for her and her family just like they did in egypt brothers we have heard hermanos sisters is you know brother bauman says you still a mono brand that rahab didn't say let me see it got opened the red sea or let me see do you let me see him do something like that then how he hit the spice and maybe i would have hid you all escondido if i seen something like that she didn't wait for that she said i god bless you brothers [Applause] amen joshua chapter two josue capitol of those uh verse one uno um i'll just go ahead and read it real quick it says then joshua son of nun secretly sent two spies from shateem go look over the land he said especially the jericho so then they went and entered the house of the prostitute named rahab and stayed there josue amen just to give a little bit background of where she comes in the picture uh when joshua was called he was lifted with a similar um anointment like moses uh the bible says that he was filled with the spirit of wisdom and joshua we know he said josue the bible says um the the god told joshua as i am with with you or how i was with moses i am with you most you know moses was the one that received the promise viola promesa but joshua josue was the one that was going to take the point he was the one that was going to get a hold of the promises in order to experience the promise in order to experience that promise he had a he had an account he had to encounter with a rahab elsa he had a two cent he sent two spies el man just like we read and two then we're gonna go into jericho okay ahead and joshua sent this to spies to meet with uh with the rahab the prostitute you know and she was she was an enemy yeah era you know god uses an enemy to to to reach the promised land was a bridge to the promised land you know rahab didn't have a good reputation you know she wasn't accepted by her own people she was intercepted in her own society and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and you uh and that you terror and fallen upon us and that are the inhabitants of the land faint because of you second we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you when you came out of egypt we'll just leave it there it's crazy to think that a woman with this type of lifestyle esta vida a woman that name that has never heard of god has never seen miracles has never seen a sign of god and this story is very aspiring i mean yes peter because it's that type of faith that god wants us to have amen you know her faith changed her life fete de rabble cambio la vida it changed her story her final her final was to die as a prostitute but she recognized the greatness of god the story of rahab begins the bible says rahab was a prostituted she probably received the title rahab the woman with the faith the woman with the great faith amen and uh one thing um how you start is it one thing is how you start and another thing is how you end yo hebrews 11. uh verse 31 this isn't the new testament also talks a little bit of her testament it says by by faith the prostitute rahab because she welcomed the spies was not killed with those who were disobedient no i can't i can't believe the rahab or you know lugar you know with all respects brothers i've been there and the pews as well with my mind elsewhere during the service you know when i should be giving god all the praise because he deserves it all amen because if it weren't for god i wouldn't have been here today i would have been lost yours nothing a limit no he uses those who want to be used you know what i'm going to finish with this in the message it says like this this fascinating i think of the i think of uh rahab the harley pienson she had not she she had never seen israel but she heard pero and she hid her own people and everything else she never said wait till i hear joshua preach sometime let me join my conception my conception after i hear him preach if you know you cannot change where you come from you cannot change what you've been through but you can't change what happens at the next moment that's all you along with all those great people no you know by faith the prostitute didn't perish [Music] she didn't do miracles [Music] you know she gave hospitality to spies she she risked her life at your household by faith [Music] and she was saved [Music] [Music] you know [Music] [Applause] [Music] man [Music] oh [Music] [Music] boy [Music] by [Music] foreign
