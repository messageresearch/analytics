scripture so you may take your seats we'll be reading second Corinthians 8 9.7 as you know uh and next week they'll be celebrating Christmas hey but all of that is fantasy all of that is fantasy Jesus Christ siendo Rico fueces Enriquez for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich why don't you tell your neighbor your brother Lord where we can trust in your grace we love you Lord the world celebrates many things for Christmas actually they set aside the meaning of Christmas very privileged this morning our hearts gracias foreign as I was commenting El Mundo the world at this moment and even members from church are more focused on the things that happen in the world but I do not blame them that's as far as a person concerns you cannot blame people because that's as far as they can see they can't see further we will be speaking today my subject this morning I titled it in English because I I love it more let me tell you about Jesus Jesus [Music] that's the meaning of Christmas essence of Christmas they don't know what to celebrate we're only celebrating put this on my nose but what is a myth and imaginary story lives [Music] [Music] stay in that Manger [Music] you would be rich stand up this morning how did he make me Rich oh come on how did he make me Rich you might not have a lot of money he made you rich one of his purposes one of the purposes he came to Earth was to understand us experience it is by himself in himself the pain the poverty he couldn't understand you had to come down and came in the form of a child he could have snot come out right people can't understand themselves he came with a purpose he said for love okay he did it for his love it's for you it's for you foreign he did it for me he being rich became poor having everything lacking nothing he left his throne Isaiah says he's the spies come with all of this in him how is it possible for a child born in a manger came with this inside of him he was bearing all of this how is it possible a man of sorrow he was an expert his expert and and grief what he did it to understand us if you're struggling with something he is an expert and heartbreaking experts do we understand she's an expert in that okay so be tested and understand us foreign I'm not speaking of a myth is that Jesus has transformed my life is something important me my salvation my family my children my precious family here there might be scuffs between it was the best that God could give us that is I hope you're understanding me not a fiction God is this child came with all of this is this child that people that they celebrate on the 20th this child came with all of this so not so he could understand so that one day you don't have an excuse me nobody understands understand me no one else does maybe no one understands me no one might not understand me but he understands me he understands you Maestro because he's a master and Brokenness acquainted with grief Ro nospreciado estimamus and we hear us were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him what does the world do today we do not esteem him and before now our focused on gifts don't focus on gifts this Christmas he can buy anything you want that's the truth I told the client yesterday I'm gonna tell you the truth you have everything she does not need anything we don't need anything what do you need to watch yourself spiritually foreign spiritually yes and sometimes want to give life and that's where I'm headed we want to keep others life we're poor president but he made himself thank you thank you I'm rich in you I'm not missing anything but he paid for that sickness brethren esta Manana this morning you can be delivered even from depression that filthy devil of depression God can deliver you what's the right word like Hitler I don't want a dictator I don't want a dictator no one forces me to come here no one forces I'm suffering oh God that has everything that love is a perfect love you will be rich in love thank you God is he came to understand to comprehend us for we have not and high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities tempted like as we are yeah without sin and this is 16 says let us therefore come only why don't we come why don't we come forward this morning that child is that was one of the purposes so that we could get close unless we have the privilege and we don't want to um my God my God is not a beggar he's not a beggar the privilege is yours this morning to the throne of grace and said revealing Grace we may understand our purpose [Applause] I wish he was on Earth you can understand your purpose on this Earth brother pranam says now watch Hebrews 3 1. the Bible says that he is the high priest of our confession is that correct now that's Professor yes he can do a thing for us until we accept it is amen God has healed me God has delivered me of something I believe there are witnesses here hello is that right he can do a thing no matter what it is you've got to accept it by faith first that's where it is you want to be delivered there's the key accepted by faith it will manifest o and believe it and confesses correct intercessions is that right [Music] the most intimate place I guarantee you that he will understand you because his word is true this is he sympathizes with our sickness as far as I know that it's the truth how many believe the angel of the Lord how many believe the angels we should take this the Second Step forgive me the first point was to understand this I can spend a lot of time but I want to finish the second point was to save us to rescue us we can be in church and loss that's the truth was in the same church that Jesus was and he was lost he came to rescue us because we didn't have access that privilege because it's a privilege to come into His presence just because it pleased him my God is real foreign he is here this is below Rejoice greatly shout he said it says shout out daughter of Jerusalem let's bring it here to us let's sing of Jubilee because a child was sent to us that you and I would have access Behold thy King cometh on City Salvador he is just and having salvation and riding upon an ass sovereign see him oh wait a minute oh brother people are going crazy for what's happening in the world but let me tell you there's nothing better than our Jesus there's nothing better than our Jesus you think soccer is going to take away your illness you think Santa Claus Santa Claus you think Santa Claus will take your sorrow depression all the demons you think Santa's gonna take that from you no sir something that they exaggerated but my Jesus is real and you are sure because you have experience no experience in your life he rescued us brethren they say um and the message Redeemer Redemption what did he redeem is my soul and your soul from hell aren't you glad for that because we were on our way there maybe you were on your way straight to heaven but I was you'll see I was I was poor brethren economics economically also poor I remember when I was a child and my grandmother buys cereals with my brothers we'd get a super small portion of something a small cornflakes we would spread them out I remember sometimes that's how God's grace is we have so much of him that of his grace we make a disgrace that we think God will forgive us we think he will be there for us all the time that's a lie of the devil because God's grace is still upon you this is brought back everything Adam lost what did Adam lose what did Adam lose one of the things was love Adam lost a lot cuando hello when he put you in a pawn shop he changed us he changed everything and he put us in a pawn shop Jesus Christ was his King his Redeemer who redeemed Every curse of the devil and this morning God redeemed you ready he redeems your soul he redeems your body your sick body how many are sick this morning a lot of sick people forgive me he redeemed his soul he redeems the sad and angry spirit maybe you don't have a need um maybe by God's grace you have everything you have a home a vehicle let me ask you what about spiritually there's time for everything but when we put something first before God there's the mistake what was the purpose if God took a filthy vessel olympio and washed it and is he just gonna store it I was even a thief but those glasses were very pretty there that's fine they look nice to do something with us that's the third Point second Corinthians and God is able to make all grace abound toward you get always bound to every good work that's the reason that's why God rests that's why that child that came in Christmas [Music] that's as far as they can see what's the pig's fall of being born a pig that's as far as that's as far as they can see he said May abound to every good work abounds in us that fragrance is that fragrance that fragrance the rose of sharing is to release that fragrance in you are you understanding that he may be reflected through myself if not there's something wrong that's right songs songs era is especias aromaticas his cheeks are as a bed of spices here is Solomon speaking as sweet as flowers his lips like lilies dropping sweet smelling Mirror Mirror you should lay yourself I amen God wants you brother that's why he came to redeem us to release that fragrance gonna be reading this to finish sometimes we think because we have a few dollars we're rich but in reality we are poor sometimes we're lusting after the incorrect things sometimes because he has so much money okay and has millions and millions Steve Jobs let me tell you something Steve Jobs said Steve Jobs Steve Jobs these iPads this body will be found in this day he said this is I have reached the Pinnacle of success in business [Music] what's the use what's the points what's it good foreign my life has been the symbol of success that's what matters to me however [Music] I have little Joy and this morning we are rich because he made himself that joy that joy in our souls [Music] that we go through that we Face sometimes we focus more on problems and there's nothing more important after all [Music] wealth is just a fact I'm used to Allah maybe you also have everything you're used to yes we are used to right now lying in my Hospital and looking back on my entire life [Music] I realize all the praise and riches I was so proud they have becoming significant and this in the face of imminent death stay here [Music] please stand okay I believe we're in the best place it's not a better place that's fine there's nothing wrong but if we're missing the joy if we're missing for missing the healing natural physics and spiritually we are poor but there's no reason to be poor he made himself he suffered everything to make you rich this morning pray Heavenly Father thank you Lord for your presence being a
