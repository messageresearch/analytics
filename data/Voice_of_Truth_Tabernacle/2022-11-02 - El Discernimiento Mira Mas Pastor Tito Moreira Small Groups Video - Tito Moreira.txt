TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you brothers in this group in the homes we are going to continue talking about the pergamon age of the pergamon church and we will also be talking about the third stage of the perfect man which I am calling discernment we know that we know it by knowledge or science too but I am calling it discernment because I think that is the best way to describe it now talking about discernment we want to take up the topic discernment Looks further, discernment Looks further there are going to be three things that I want you to realize that discernment Looks at. number one discernment Look more of the spiritual things of God discernment looks more to the spiritual things of God number 2 discernment looks more to the danger and The deception of the devil, discernment Looks more to the danger and The deception of the devil and number 3 discernment Looks more and understands more of what is happening in oneself and in others three things which We are going to talk about now and I would like you to simply write them down and lets see how it is that discernment serves us so much and helps us so much in the Pergamon age God Praises the people because although they were in a dangerous place and in a place of so much deception there were people who were overcoming And this is the reason why they were overcoming because they had spiritual discernment now number one discernment Looks more than the spiritual things of God look at what it says here in psalm 139 verse 7 to 8 it says 7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. now it says Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? In other words god is speaking through the psalmist David, to us and he is telling us my presence is everywhere there are many people who only look at God in the church there are people who only look at God in the word there is people who only look at God in the message of the hour and all that is fine God is in his word God is in the church God is in the message of the hour but God is in more than all that brothers the first Bible that existed were were the stars and God hid in all his nature he is hidden he is hidden in the simplest things and it takes a spiritual discernment it takes a true spiritual eye to be able to see God in the smallest things if you have spiritual discernment you will be able to look at God everywhere where I will flee from your presence says the psalmist Where will I flee from your spirit wherever I go there you are Oh Brothers How beautiful it is to be able to look at God every day at every moment at every sunrise at every bedtime at every sitting How beautiful it is to be able to say God is always around me and I manage to look at it because we could be blessed by God's blessings constantly and never We never look at it, we never realize it, but discernment helps us to look at more of the spiritual things of God and so we can not only be happy and praise God for what he is doing and why we look at it, but it also helps us to listen to him to receive guidance from God because to receive guidance from God so that he guides us so that he tells us Look son you need to do it this way Look daughter this what you have to do so that he guides you or the guide you need first realize that he is there and that he is talking to you and that he is trying to communicate with you if you never realize that he is there that he is speaking you will never be able to receive guidance from God and correct knowledge to know when something is from God and when something is not from God that is why it is important to look more at the spiritual things of God now number 2 knowledge looks more at danger it looks at it sooner looks at it further away the wise man looks at danger from afar you do not need the danger to be upon you for you to say there is danger there because there is something inside you that tells you that it is not from God that is from the enemy you manage to look at the enemy and what he's trying to do look what it says here again in Revelation chapter 2 verse 13 it says 13 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. in other words you haven't let yourself be deceived by Satan although you are where he dwells where his throne is although you are in such a dangerous time you continue with the right thing because you have been able to look you have been able to look at the enemy you have been able to realize discern when it is the devil who is trying to deceive you he is trying to lead you down the wrong path and you manage to look at him and you identify him and identify his tricks identify his tactics and the bad things he wants to do against you and by looking at him with time and by looking at him or what the devil wants to do you have the opportunity to block him from changing direction in his own territory but you need to have the discernment to know what he is happening how the enemy is trying to deceive you thats number 2 number three the discernment gives you more understanding about what is happening within you and within others look brothers many times we only look superficially when we look at others or even look at ourselves we see that they are angry we see that they are sad we see that maybe they just have things that they can't do or that they make mistakes fall we see someone slip we see ourselves as a failure but behind all that there is more there are more there are people that sometimes you see them angry but they're not angry Simply they are hurt they have been injured sometimes they have complexes sometimes they feel less sometimes the devil is attacking them behind the scenes there is a war what is happening and the devil is attacking them sometimes that we don't understand why we keep falling and falling and falling and it is because within us there is a spiritual war. discernment helps us to understand What is happening within us Look at what Psalm 79 verses 1 to 6 continues to say 139 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. 2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. 3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. 4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether. 5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. the psalmist is saying God You know me completely you know why I get up why I'm sad V I'm going there I'm going here you understand what I don't understand what I don't understand you understand what I don't see you understand you understand why I struggle How can I win How can I get out of where I am You have more knowledge than what I have now That is the knowledge that God wants to give us Because discernment is discernment or knowledge of God that he gives us wants to give For our lives to understand each other better to understand each other better to know that behind the superficial things there are spiritual things happening to us spiritual battles that we are fighting and unless God gives us spiritual discernment we will not know we will not understand and we will not be able help we are not going to be able to go out and help others and say brother Forgive me I am going to say the best and most correct words I am going to help you and not judge you because now I understand what you are going through for that discernment is needed discernment is needed When someone someone Simply is not there having a good day because the devil is attacking them and you go and sometimes you want to knock down the person and attack the person sometimes their husband their wife their children make a mistake and one does not have the discernment of how to talk to them how to help them discernment is needed to be able to still sometimes help others and not attack them not think of the worst of them discernment is needed And that what God wants to give us those are the three things that God wants to give us Now I want to say this so that you understand one thing so that you can discern more notice more be more aware of God and problems and everything else there is one there is a requirement brothers there is something you have to do you have to stop you need not to be in a hurry because when we are in a hurry when we go too fast we do not notice many things things pass us by but when we stop when we go slowly when we stop When we meditate then God starts to show us things that we weren't looking at before God starts to show us things that we didn't notice before Then it's so important its important to stop to stop to go slowly to listen to God to notice to realize what God is doing brothers and we are sometimes in a world of running 100 miles per hour and we do not stop but it is time brothers to stop and we want spiritual discernment we need to stop stop say lord what are you trying to tell me maybe you want to warn me of a danger maybe you want me to be of better help to someone maybe you want me to call someone maybe you want to direct me one way or another you have to stop stop yourself brother of running arrive at the service on time stay still and with this I recommend everyone please in your home services keep the atmosphere still keep keep the children still go with a mentality of being calm to arrive on time of not being distracted by eating things no be focused and giving time to the Holy Spirit time to show you more give you more discernment its very important so brothers I hope you have learned those three things talk about those three things number one discernment Looks more of the spiritual things of God number 2 discernment Looks at the danger and the enemy and number 3 discernment Looks more into yourself into others to understand them better God bless you we love you and we'll see each other next time 1. What things does discernment see? 2. In what circumstances do we need more discernment? 3. How can we discern more?
