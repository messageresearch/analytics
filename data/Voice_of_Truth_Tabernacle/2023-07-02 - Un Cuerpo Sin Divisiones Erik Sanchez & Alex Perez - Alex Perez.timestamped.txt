[19:07] having your happy foreign
[19:30] it's a great opportunity it's not a
[19:33] better place
[19:37] because we're always working for God
[19:41] for his body for his people
[19:44] gratification it's it's something that
[19:47] comes with great gratification
[19:54] the opportunity
[19:57] we hope the answer in the same manner
[20:01] we'll take two scriptures
[20:06] we'll take a First Corinthians
[20:09] chapter 12. amen
[20:13] and we'll read uh verse 24 25 and 26.
[20:18] First Corinthians
[20:20] chapter 12 verse 24.
[20:31] the Lord reads like this is
[20:42] for our company parts have no need but
[20:46] God has tempered the body together
[20:47] having given more abundant honor to that
[20:49] part which lacked
[20:57] there should be no Schism in the body
[21:00] but that the members should have the
[21:02] same care for one for another
[21:05] what is uh the schism
[21:09] there would be no conflict
[21:12] or a disagreement or division yes
[21:26] and whether one member suffer all the
[21:29] members suffer with it or one member be
[21:30] honored all the members Rejoice with it
[21:35] we'll go to our first Chronicles
[21:39] chapter 11. First Chronicles chapter 11.
[21:53] edius
[21:57] verse
[21:59] 9 and 10.
[22:09] so
[22:20] David Works greater and greater for the
[22:22] Lord of hosts was with him
[22:30] these are also the chief of the Mighty
[22:32] Men Who David had who strengthened
[22:34] themselves with him in his kingdom and
[22:36] with all Israel to make him King
[22:38] according to the word of the Lord
[22:39] concerning Israel now notice here
[22:43] these are these Mighty Men
[22:45] we're with David
[22:48] the word of the Lord says
[22:50] that they they straighten themselves
[22:53] with him in his kingdom
[22:56] now we'll jump to verse 22.
[23:00] I'm going to be focusing on this a
[23:02] little bit more
[23:04] in first Chronicles 11 22.
[23:26] who had done many acts he slew two
[23:30] lion-like men of Moab also he went down
[23:32] and threw a lion in a pit in a snowy day
[23:34] let us pray
[23:43] we're happy circumstances
[23:52] one should be happy and thankful we are
[23:56] here
[23:57] for you
[23:59] and we want to do you a service
[24:05] he would come on a scene and help us
[24:08] that my brothers would take
[24:10] for what I try to say and not for what I
[24:14] say
[24:16] interpretation
[24:19] as well as brothers
[24:27] each one of your sons and daughters
[24:33] they would receive what you have foreign
[24:42] oh
[24:45] the the theme is God's team as a
[24:49] subtitle
[24:51] it's a body without division
[25:19] and First Chronicles chapter 11.
[25:27] these chapters of the Bible
[25:30] it teaches us that David was captive
[25:36] um
[25:39] because he wanted to kill him but on the
[25:43] other hand
[25:46] that also wanted to kill him adelam
[25:59] but he was not alone
[26:03] there was this group of valiant men yes
[26:14] and the kingdom
[26:27] they were a group of elite
[26:30] it was the best of the best
[26:34] there was about 400 soldiers
[26:38] but this was the cream of the Cross this
[26:42] was a group of the Elites
[26:45] in order to defend their kids and defend
[26:48] the kingdom
[26:50] Defender
[27:03] and in this time
[27:06] I believe there's no exception
[27:09] we have a king
[27:11] a king of kings Justice
[27:44] what is needed
[27:48] God needs
[27:52] are you the hell
[27:54] people that desire to help
[27:57] they want to help a church
[28:02] I go to church
[28:19] what can I do for my sister that's the
[28:22] question
[28:28] a
[28:36] um
[28:37] to be a member of God's team
[28:40] um
[28:44] and not flee
[28:46] all right look which is many of these
[28:50] men
[28:51] they they fled when the Philistines
[28:54] would go and attack them
[28:58] they stayed
[29:01] and they faced the Philistines
[29:04] that's what is needed also not to run or
[29:06] flee
[29:09] although things make it difficult
[29:11] we need to stand firm yeah and support
[29:15] our Brethren help them
[29:17] protect them
[29:20] a third point
[29:24] the Mighty Men of the Kingdom they
[29:28] defend the kingdom
[29:30] the David's Mighty Men
[29:33] they stayed there to defend the king
[29:36] and the kingdom
[29:39] and they they fought with him uh
[29:42] shoulder to shoulder now look
[29:48] amongst the group were these menombre
[30:23] a certain area
[30:38] there were also tremendous men
[30:47] Aya there was this man by the name of
[30:50] banaya
[30:51] he was a a Mighty Man
[30:56] we just read in the scripture he killed
[30:59] two lions
[31:02] and when I read that story
[31:04] foreign
[31:53] [Music]
[32:02] this man killed his giant
[32:07] this Egyptian
[32:10] he was he came with a with a spirit
[32:15] descended against him
[32:24] he kills that Egyptian
[32:27] but what catches my attention the most
[32:31] is
[32:32] it this this courageous maniah
[32:35] he kills another lion
[32:38] and this line was a a a natural lion
[32:45] and a second Samuel 23 20. we just we
[32:50] just read it
[32:53] he said he went down into a pit and
[32:56] killed a lion
[32:58] on a snowy day
[33:02] the Bible doesn't say
[33:15] around there
[33:18] but he faced him
[33:22] this lion
[33:29] to eat man he was a cousin
[33:33] and you know
[33:35] and he and he and he was he was right
[33:38] there
[33:39] he was in the village
[33:43] he was terrorizing the the people that
[33:45] populated The Village
[33:47] but the Bible says
[33:53] he descended to fight with him now look
[33:57] to fight in the snowy day temperatures
[34:01] what a a very uh the temperature was
[34:04] very cold it's not just anything
[34:08] but that that did not stop banaya
[34:11] is
[34:15] from going to a place many times
[34:19] we make an excuse of the climate
[34:21] conditions
[34:36] it makes it great even more
[34:39] and here was banaya
[34:49] he was being hunted
[34:51] and there was banaya
[34:55] hmm
[34:56] is
[34:59] I imagine maybe maybe they were there
[35:02] around the cave and it was a snowy day
[35:06] maybe there was a lot of snow around
[35:10] you know when the ground is is filled
[35:13] with snow
[35:14] you don't know what's beneath the snow
[35:17] and then
[35:20] I imagine that
[35:22] goes against the Lions
[35:26] and the line goes in and jumps towards
[35:29] him
[35:31] but this this line takes a fast and it
[35:35] falls into a pit
[35:42] goes to the edge of the pit there
[35:45] and he looks at The Lion
[35:49] and the lion looks at him and they they
[35:52] they they they look at each other
[35:55] I imagine banaya
[36:35] it was a sign of death
[36:39] all of a sudden from the cave
[36:43] a hand comes out all right
[36:46] it's the hand of banaya
[36:49] with wounds on his body
[36:51] and scratches across his body
[36:56] where it bites across his body
[36:59] but it was the reflection
[37:09] is
[37:11] fears that he had
[37:18] and when he comes out
[37:21] imagine yes
[37:27] there were many stitches needed to heal
[37:30] those wounds
[37:31] but perhaps a lot of medication
[37:35] but when he recovers
[37:38] there was King David
[37:53] a lion and a bear
[37:56] yes
[38:01] he had won such a great uh
[38:06] you want to be a part of that team yes
[38:09] foreign
[38:56] problems in your marriage
[39:00] perhaps that lion
[39:03] is defeating you or with addictions
[39:10] addiction to a drug
[39:37] it'll be a great problem wow that's good
[39:40] that's right
[39:42] that's right
[39:44] man
[39:46] this man Hallelujah
[39:51] the word says
[39:55] the book of Hebrews
[40:02] 11.
[40:05] verse 33 excuse me
[40:08] says through faith is
[40:11] subdued kingdoms
[40:15] righteousness
[40:16] obtain promises
[40:19] stop the mouths of lions
[40:32] they took care of him
[40:38] amongst them there was not any any false
[40:41] words
[40:44] there was not one that didn't feel for
[40:46] the other I believe
[40:49] they took care of one another foreign
[41:20] says here
[41:23] in the message
[41:27] and we'll be closing with this he cried
[41:31] out
[41:33] if I only had a drink from that well
[41:36] again
[41:56] his desire was a commandment to those
[41:58] who loved him sorry
[42:00] you know
[42:01] I believe that God's desires
[42:04] should be a commandment for those that
[42:07] love him remember
[42:11] the soul was crying for a drink of that
[42:13] water and those who loved him
[42:17] this desire was a
[42:20] commands
[42:22] we're told that one of those three of
[42:25] those men got together
[42:53] they were Gentiles
[42:56] the majority of them was gentiles
[43:00] oh God they weren't even Jewish people
[43:04] watch where they come from David David
[43:08] here's the type of Christ
[43:11] because Christ is
[43:17] crying for a drink of that water
[43:19] as I said
[43:29] Hombres
[43:32] down to that City
[43:38] While others
[43:41] then we're Gallant Fighting
[43:45] twice their size some of them
[43:50] but they were men
[43:52] who could fight
[43:58] [Music]
[44:01] 800 men right around him in one day
[44:03] they were great
[44:05] they trust you guys
[44:27] and brought that up to David so he could
[44:29] drink it wow
[44:34] I believe that this was a this was a
[44:37] truly a God God's team
[44:38] that's why God was with him
[44:41] that's why God gave him so many
[44:43] victories
[44:46] are being persecuted
[44:49] I believe
[44:51] that if we want to be a part of our
[44:53] scene Brothers
[44:58] and he thought of our beloved God
[45:01] it should be a commandment for us and we
[45:05] should act
[45:07] God bless you
[45:10] [Applause]
[45:15] Hebrews chapter 12.
[45:18] blessed be the name of the Lord
[45:22] is
[45:30] like this
[45:41] wherefore lift of the hands which hang
[45:43] down in the feeble knees
[45:57] and make straight pads for your feet
[46:00] lest that which is lame be turned out of
[46:02] the way but let it rather be healed
[46:06] I think that the the God's Army
[46:11] God's team is
[46:14] a team that's in action
[46:18] God intended for his team
[46:22] that is
[46:54] doing something for God
[47:00] go down
[47:04] in the message just show us the father
[47:08] now our religion
[47:11] this is our religion this is
[47:38] Jesus Christ
[47:54] that microphone is a complete mute
[47:58] until something speaks into it
[48:16] we have nothing Church
[48:27] through us
[48:29] hallelujah hallelujah it says like this
[48:33] that's how many many women
[48:36] you are mute
[48:39] is when it comes to these things
[48:47] but if you're in contact
[48:51] you're in contact

[49:03] [Music]
[49:12] you are not it's not your voice yes
[49:25] [Music]
[49:45] we are the people that got this again
[49:50] so that we could continue
[50:17] to be in movement
[50:20] paralysis
[51:42] [Music]
[51:56] Revelation for that
[52:04] I I I I want to go against it
[52:09] but I'm gonna go at it pretty hard
[52:12] [Applause]
[52:25] you know what happens
[52:32] he can paralyze the next member
[52:43] for me
[52:46] the Devil is a dog
[52:47] that has no power so he uses us
[52:54] we as members
[52:59] you know what brothers
[53:02] I'm going to say this is
[53:04] sometimes we as members
[53:08] instead of working as a unit or in unity
[53:19] I can paralyze another member
[53:22] faculty
[53:29] um
[53:32] [Music]
[53:50] what God wants us to achieve
[53:55] Glory
[53:57] figures
[53:59] in in the book of Ephesians chapter
[54:03] verse 11.
[54:05] this is God's team church
[54:17] and teachers
