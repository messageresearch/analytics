[20:00] brother branham new york
[20:04] well brother branham said i'm sorry
[20:08] when when he sacrificed himself
[20:11] sacrificio you know that's when we

[21:04] that for from that time forth began
[21:07] jesus showed unto his disciples that he
[21:10] must go unto jerusalem
[21:12] and suffer many things of the elders the
[21:14] chiefs the prius
[21:16] the priest and scribes and be killed and
[21:19] be
[21:20] re rised again on the third day
[21:28] says
[21:37] he already knew what was going to happen
[21:42] he could have sent archangels to destroy
[21:46] everything and it would have been over
[21:52] you know but he chose that path
[21:56] he chose that sacrifice
[21:59] sacrificio so we can receive our

[29:48] thank you for letting me see another day
[30:07] you know it just has to take baby steps
[30:13] little by little it's all processed

[30:24] that you're gonna let god come into your
[30:25] life
[30:29] and give you an identity sweden
[30:36] i want to read a quote from brother
[30:37] branham
[30:41] it's from the message uh supernatural
[30:44] amen i don't know how to pronounce the
[30:46] second word easily
[30:48] messiah
[30:54] why don't you just step off for a few
[30:56] minutes and go looking around
[30:59] at the bible
[31:06] might wander around and you might find
[31:09] yours
[31:10] yourself identified
[31:29] you may come to yourself
[31:32] like the prodigal son did come here
[31:36] and find yourself
[31:39] you might find your identification in
[31:42] the words of god
[31:44] identification
[31:49] you know that's where you're going to
[31:50] find yourself
[31:53] that's where you're going to find your
[31:54] purpose
[31:58] you know are these people that have been
[32:00] passing away
[32:01] around us
[32:05] you know all these people we all know
[32:06] someone that passed away from kovid
[32:11] you know or different things or
[32:15] you know and some of them when they die
[32:18] maybe they knew where they were going
[32:24] you know where exactly they're going
[32:26] exactly
[32:40] destination that's because they did not
[32:43] have their identification yes
[32:48] you know you have an opportunity
[32:53] you can do it every day
[33:09] what's my identity i don't want to die
[33:12] leaving this earth
[33:17] you know not knowing where i'm going
[33:21] you know i want to know where i'm going
[33:25] i know i want to know what direction i'm
[33:27] going to direction
[33:37] [Music]
[33:43] just meditate on it think about it
[33:48] find your identification and contrast
[34:18] foreign
[34:29] if we can please you want to help me out
[34:31] then
[34:33] thessalonians 4 16 please
[34:39] cuatro amen and the title in which we
[34:42] and my brother felix have put it
[34:45] yes
[34:55] amen first thessalonians 4
[34:58] chapter 6 verse 16. primarily
[35:05] it says like this for the lord for the
[35:07] lord himself shall descend from heaven
[35:10] with a shout with the voice of an
[35:12] archangel
[35:13] and with a trumpet of god and the dead
[35:15] in christ shall rise first
[35:26] then we which are alive and remain shall
[35:28] be caught up together
[35:29] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[35:32] in the air
[35:33] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[35:42] just
[35:45] [Music]
[35:57] for wrestle not against flesh and blood
[36:00] but against principalities
[36:02] against powers against the rulers of the
[36:04] darkness
[36:05] of this world against spiritual
[36:07] wickedness in high places
[36:22] amen you may be seated
[36:32] um like i said we'll be trying to share
[36:34] the word
[36:38] as best
[36:51] and let god take control
[37:07] amen and then this uh in this night an
[37:09] esta noche a theme in which they've been
[37:11] preached on fridays now
[37:15] he's being prepared is being prepared to
[37:17] leave this earth yes
[37:29] [Music]
[37:34] it's a desire for anyone
[37:37] every son and daughter of god
[37:41] leave this earth
[37:48] but the only way
[37:51] that would be able to leave this earth
[37:56] is truly to be identified
[38:01] as part of him como because the only
[38:04] thing that god is coming back
[38:10] is of what is his es
[38:13] part of him and that's why it's very
[38:17] important
[38:18] important that's us young people sienna
[38:21] hoveness
[38:21] to identify who we truly are
[38:28] in this day and age
[38:39] all right all right that's good that's
[38:40] good once i started counting
[38:44] more
[38:57] again i say it again the only way
[39:01] we are able to be lonely
[39:04] taken off from this earth
[39:08] must be truly identified
[39:12] identificado in christ jesus and christo
[39:15] jesus
[39:15] as they said in first thessalonians
[39:20] as we just read and the dead
[39:24] in christ shall rise first
[39:27] he los muertos
[39:30] and them in the clouds
[39:33] [Applause]
[39:35] the lord in the air el senor
[39:40] we all want to
[39:52] son of god
[40:10] at the resurrection
[40:14] the second coming of the lord
[40:18] and my question again as young people
[40:44] like any other one where you go out on a
[40:46] plane trip
[40:50] and
[41:26] oh sorry trying to find the message here
[41:32] but he says it's not much about packing
[41:35] it's communion
[41:40] it's it's unpacking
[41:43] letting go despojando putting aside
[42:00] taking us up from this earth
[42:04] but i say again being identified before
[42:06] creators
[42:10] because that's the first thing we must
[42:12] do
[42:14] try
[42:51] and it depends it depends on which
[42:54] spirit you
[42:55] and the cual espirito want to be
[42:58] controlled by
[42:58] the siesta controllado and like i said
[43:01] again
[43:03] the only thing that god is coming back
[43:05] for
[43:08] is of himself foreign
[44:06] i see that
[44:49] the only thing the hindus
[44:54] from doing something in your life that
[44:56] said algo and suvida
[44:58] is yourself s usted mismo but it goes
[45:01] beyond that
[45:11] because you may ask yourself well
[45:12] brother i i don't know
[45:51] and truly start positioning yourself
[45:57] in the correct position in which god
[45:59] wants you
[46:01] because the world is desiring crying out
[46:07] for the true manifestation of the
[46:08] children
[46:09] [Music]
[46:12] and our worst
[46:38] but once i can truly identify that
[46:43] identify recognize reconocerlo
[46:47] that i am wrong estoy incorrecto
[46:50] then i come to my father don says
[46:53] i come to the altar
[47:49] son and daughter of god
[48:04] i can come against you brother branham
[48:08] talks about it
[48:10] as a little man who walks out in traffic
[48:13] okay
[48:15] nothing impressive you know
[48:19] many times we think there's nothing
[48:20] oppressive about us
[48:24] we think that we have to be someone
[48:25] great
[48:28] of great name something great here at
[48:32] church i said i'll go grand then like
[48:33] truly god can identify himself in us
[48:38] you can be the doormat of the church
[48:42] but it's identified as part of christ
[49:01] and all he does is wave his hand
[49:08] but he has an identity
[49:11] he has a badge that identifies them as a
[49:15] police officer
[49:20] when he walks out into traffic
[49:25] traffic knows they must stop
[49:56] because it's the exact same thing
[49:59] because once the devil knows
[50:02] that you know who you truly are
[50:06] then he finds himself in a pickle and
[50:08] tons of salsa encounters
[50:53] ousted who you truly are
[50:56] but it's first identifying pero primero
[50:59] i say this word a lot
[51:00] of this is the only word
[51:05] take this one word
[51:22] he loves the youth with all his kids
[51:27] talking about how hi
[51:32] being a another just a rat another young
[51:36] person
[51:46] he cuts me off and tells me no you're
[51:48] not just anybody
[52:02] because if they
[52:23] and i wouldn't be dealing with the
[52:25] things i am dealing with now
[52:27] endless problems the things that people
[52:31] tell me
[52:32] medicine all the drama
[52:35] cheese man i think those things wouldn't
[52:37] matter to me
[52:39] the criticism because day by day
[52:44] does not matter
[52:50] the more you more you try to identify
[52:52] yourself in christ
[52:56] the more and more the devil tries to
[52:57] attack you mask
[53:25] the more precious is the reward
[53:41] in christ jesus and christo jesus
[53:44] there's nothing he can throw you away
[53:49] there's nothing he can throw you away
[53:55] there's nothing you can do to you know
[54:00] but my question is to you tonight
[54:04] do you truly want to be identified
[54:51] that he's coming back for portland
[54:56] i'm not drinking anything special
[55:00] i'm pretty much being an echo
[55:18] what are you doing today questa siendo
[55:20] hoy that is truly pushing you
[55:22] quello estan pujando to truly identify
