send uh greetings uh to our brothers Froman uh our brothers from California CIA uh you know uh just to start off I want to uh I want to you know thank uh thank the Lord you know for uh giving uh giving me the privilege uh to be able to go on this uh trip last week to uan yeah I believe it was a victorious trip our pastor he he didn't say it on on on Wednesday uh but uh we uh we had the privilege of uh baptizing uh you know the the first soul in ran and you know her name was uh Pearl you know so she was lot lost Pearl and uh and and you know we found her there in uran you know and if the Lord just sent us for that one uh if it was just the one if it was just that one then it was it was it was it was worth it amen amen and you know the Lord's been good amen amen um let us uh open our Bibles uh to the book of uh um The Book of John chapter 10 verse 27 we want to uh preach with uh the title responding to the voice let us uh read the the word of the Lord John 10 verse 27 it reads like this says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me um John 15 verse 13 John 15 verse 13 reads like this says greater love hath no man than this that a man laay down his life for his friends uh let us bow our heads in prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord this morning for the privilege that you uh that you give us uh to come before your presence Lord to be able to speak your word that brings life to your church that quickens the dead father we just ask Lord that you move in every heart Lord in every heart that's expecting Lord great from you because I believe there's nothing greater than your word we just we just uh we're just grateful Lord and we just uh we just Des desire that that you would just move amongst us and just Quicken every fiber of our body Lord that we would uh that we would live uh live live for your purpose father put ourselves in your hands that we ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen uh you may be seated um responding to the voice uh you know our Lord Jesus Christ you know when he's uh speaking here he uh there's two things that he says that really uh catch my attention uh you know he says my sheep hear my voice and he says and then and and they and they follow me amen amen so there's a hearing and then there's and then there's a there's an action uh because when you uh when you hear something a lot of times it seems like people don't hear anything you know it's like it's like they they they're they're dead you know because there's no action behind behind what they heard you know and a lot of times it's not so much the people out there that are hearing uh you know that it's not it's not their fault a lot of times other times it's behind the pulpit amen because there has to be a a quickened words you know something that has life in it it it order to produce an action amen amen you know the the the phes you know in this chapter you know they come and they uh they want uh they want an answer from the Lord it seemed like they were uh for some reason in suspense no they they they come and they tell them like don't leave us in suspense or in doubt any longer uh you know but the Lord the Lord had reminded reminds them of all the things he had done up to this point amen amen uh because he had done many things he he had had shown them many miracles uh many signs uh up to that point but they they wanted uh they wanted more but uh Matthew I want you to go to Matthew 12 verse 40 something that uh our brother Isaac touched on a little bit touched on Jonas on Friday on Jonah Friday it says for as as as Jonas was three days and three nights in the wells belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth you know when uh the the when the the Pharisees you know ask the Lord for a sign you know he tells them you're not going to get any any other sign uh than the sign of the prophet Jonah because up to that point he had done many things uh and and you know they still didn't believe they didn't believe the Miracles oh they didn't believe the the the signs and so they weren't going to believe anything but but Jonah when Jonah was sent to uh to n oh there there was something that there was a lot of things that he didn't do and the people still believed you see Jonah didn't he didn't perform any Miracles Jonah didn't have forgiveness for him he had no mercy he had no love and they still believed the preaching of the word and is telling them all I'm going to give you now is the preaching of the word see I don't believe it's any different in this day because I believe the Lord Has Done many things in our Liv worked many miracles wond comprehend he's done it and we still want a sign we still want some kind of indication if it's him or not well he tells us the same thing today I won't give you anything else but the preaching of the word amen amen don't get me wrong the Lord still does great things but if it seems like after he's done he's he's done great things it seems like we're uh we're quick to forget him and uh we're ready to ask for another one as if he had never done anything so I believe that the Lord Jesus was in his every right to not give them any more signs uh because you know it seemed like like they were the ones that were trying to set the standard you know but but the only one that puts the standard is our lord Jesus standard he has for every son and daughter of God is to have faith that's the standard that's what he wants from every single one of us amen amen I want to read a quote from uh brother brandom you know when he talks about the voice it says the same voice that summoned John come up the same voice that said to John come up it's the same voice that will summon the church someday also the same voice that summoned John to come up is the same voice that summoned dead Lazarus out of the Grave it says that same voice of the Archangel it says Christ is the voice of the Archangel oh that trumpet voice of Christ summon John to come up the same voice that summoned Lazarus it says did you notice at the grave of Lazarus he spoke with a loud voice not just said Lazarus come forth he says Lazarus come forth you summon him from the dead and he answered here am I and he come from the dead after he was dead and his body rot in amen amen I believe we have the privilege uh this morning of being able to hear that same voice amen amen I believe it 100% I believe uh that the word of God spoken through a vessel of God is no different than the voice of God for this day amen amen you see because they were many of them were saying they they were saying well well show us a sign you know when the rich man when the rich man heard Jesus and Jesus asks him to do something he didn't quite hear exactly what what was being asked of Hima you see uh because a lot of times we don't like what we hear you know it's like we get that rich man syndrome amen amen the reason I say that is because there was no response to uh to what Jesus asked him to do you know and I believe it's a lot whole lot different many times because now we come to church now we hear God's word there's no response to the word there's no obedience to the word of God when God asks you to do something and you act like you don't hear it I want to let you know that there's a problem there you know there's a spiritual death that's happening you know there's a spiritual death that's happening and you know and it's it's it's not so much out in the world you know a lot of times it's here in the church a lot of times we think we're alive but we're dying on the church PE there's no action no obedience there's no humility but Jesus he didn't come just tell us what to do but he came to show us how to do that's right you see I don't have a lot of respect for somebody uh that tells me to do something and they themselves don't can't do it there's a lot of people that are given a position they're given a place and and they just because it was given to them they think that they could just order people to do things when they themselves don't know how to do it see I don't believe that that's a true leader amen because I'm not saying a leader has to know everything but he does have to get involved he has to get involved in the in in in things of the church he has to show you how to be humble he has to show you he has to show you the way of God because he's been put in a leadership role amen amen I mean could you imagine if Jesus had spoke you know Lazarus come forth and nothing would have happened you see there's a lot of people uh you know they they they they tell somebody to do something and it's not done you know it would be a shame it would be a shame you know if if this if if this would have been the situation with Jesus but you know it wasn't you know but this happens in church a lot of times you know what I'm I'm I'm guilty I'm I'm I'm a guilty person I don't believe I'm the only one amen you know when God calls us to complete obedience and you know and we don't do it it it's it's uh it's pretty disappointing you know but what's more disappointing is when you acknowledge that you haven't done certain things and you don't do anything to fix it amen amen you know I I want to read a quote from Brother brandom you know in the message the end time seed he says that's the way the people gets away from the word of God it becomes a hybrid Affair it must die it says it cannot bring forth of its kind to life again it says now listen to this it says the church that will refuse to believe the word of God is a hybrid church with dogmas a Creeds a doctr that's not scriptural it says that church cannot bring forth the spirit filled child because it's hybrid it's no good it might be bigger a great big wall ofine pews of big bells seats but that doesn't mean one thing it's spiritually dead it cannot bring forth spirit filled children because it's dead itself amen amen you see I believe but that when when we hear the word of God you see it should Quicken it should take us to an action you see that's the response that God wants he wants to see action he wants to see you do something you it it may not be a big thing you know to somebody else but if you're doing it for God if you're doing it for his children then it's as if you were doing it for God himself but you know we we like to run from those things we like to run from resp responsibility you know we got of push our jobs off on somebody else amen amen or is it just me you know because I'm I'm guilty of it but you know God doesn't want that he wants you to take responsibility he wants you to take ownership to take ownership of of of what he called you to do he wants you to say here am I behold I'm here I'm ready to go to the work you see when Jesus came he didn't come so that everybody would come serve him but he went to go serve he went to go Serve the People wherever he went he was doing something to the point that the reputation he had it went ahead of him it went before him see Jesus Jesus before he got to a place they were already doing something see that's the type of reputation the children of God should have when people find out you're going you know they should be already active because a child of God if you're a son or daughter of God your reputation will take people to action there's something inside of you because there's a name that's backing you up not so much a name but a god a true and living God with with power with a word of power that takes you to do something for him but when when we find out where he's where where we're going a lot of times because Jesus wasn't just leading them in the blind you know work like that he wasn't leading them on some kind of suicide mission and he's not leading you he's not leading you to a suicide mission if you trust God you know he may put you in an uncomfortable situation you know he may take things away from you and you may not like it but he's showing you you know that the Way Up Is Down amen amen I believe that you see because Jesus he wasn't running from death but because the mission death was actually a part of that mission amen and he wasn't running from it he was running to it he was going to it he was ready to face it no matter what it was and no matter who was in his way no matter what obstacle no matter who was with them and who wasn't with he was going all the way the disciples tried to stop them but they couldn't do it that leads me to believe that there are people even in the church that are going to try to stop you fulfilling God's work from fulfilling God's work but if you're a true son or daughter of God are you keep pushing through you keep persevering keep walking you'll keep fighting even if you're uing if you're in pain even if it's almost too much to bear you're going to keep going you trusted God you trusted him when it was good and you trust him when it's looking bad you trust him through the trial you trust through the Temptation understanding and knowing that you will be rejected amen amen you'll be rejected you see I got to thinking I got to thinking you see Jesus just kept going he he got rejected by his own people he got rejected for doing good amen amen that was one of the reasons I believe part of the reason that hell couldn't hold them the hell couldn't hold them because like our Pastor said and like the word says they weren't worthy they weren't worthy of having him down there too good for him so he was expelled he was expelled from [Music] Hell much for them to hear and you know it's the same way with you go out doing good you go out doing good and they're going to reject you as well not for doing something bad you know there's people that go to school and they get expelled they expel them they get expelled for doing something bad but we're living in an age where they're they're rejecting you for doing good for doing the right thing because that's not good to them the Bible says in the last days that they would call they would call good evil and Evil good but what will you respond to will you respond to the voice to the voice of God in this last days to the word of God because Lazarus responded because he had a seed he had the seed of God that would not allow him to stay in the grave it won allow you to stay down going allow you to stay in your condition on your circumstances it won't allow you to stay falling not only will it bring you up but it'll take you out that's exactly what it'll do May our brother come forward God bless you [Music] how many can thank the Lord for his wordin can follow me to the scripture in 1 Corinthians 14 verse6 answering to The Voice um the Lord only has one voice the question this morning what are you answering to [Music] um are you responding to your feelings are you responding to what you believe are you responding to your brother that is giving you something that isn't God's word I always say this what I think doesn't matter many times what I believe doesn't matter many times what someone else believes doesn't matter all that matters is the word what the word of our Lord Jesus Christ says for me this is my absolute for me there's Assurance if I stay with the word my feelings don't count if I answer to that voice there is Assurance amen so the question is what do we answer to are we listening to The Voice he has one voice and that voice many times is uncomfortable because it's not fixing to how I am because it's not related to what I want and it makes me uncomfortable that's why the people don't accept that voice that reached Us in this time when that voice comes it beats you like gold that is beaten how how gold is stricken until he begins to project or reflects he that is beating him but it's so tremendous and painful to hear that voice let's bring it to pass amen amen I would like to read because we heard a lot of things but we don't hear his [Music] voice and the scripture says in 1 Corinthians 14 verse6 ahe now Brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or prophesying or by Doctrine and even the things without Life Giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in [Music] sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle amen amen and I got all of this from one message that our brother Bram preached the message is called uncertain sound what are we [Music] hearing and brother brandham speaks about the mind and the Soul how it is that we receive how we receive God's word many times in our mind but never comes to the soul and brother bam expresses himself in this message and I love so much how he says it's time to put milk aside and it's time to go in deeper that's why I say this this message is so beautiful Mage this word takes us to maturity takes us to a growth where you can be safe safe Brethren this morning if I can accomplish this to remove your conscience a little that you analyze yourself what have you heard what do you have and what's in your hearts because in the heart is a compartment where God deposited the soul amen amen the prophet says in the message uncertain sound because I don't to me it doesn't matter to me what church people belongs to the main thing is if they're Christian how many times do we believe that message Believers are the only Christians we shout it and preach it but here brother brandom he says it doesn't matter to me what church people belongs to the main thing is if they're Christian and look we're walking to something that a lot of people even in denominations brother is even going to say here Catholic Church I believe there are children of God in there and in this church Message Church there are three types of believers also there's the manufactur there's the Believers and the unbelievers in this church you can uh Point them out you can't tell your brother he's an unbeliever we believe we're all believers but we know by the message it's not so amen amen so brother brandham says what's in your soul what matters is if you're a Christian because there are many manufactured amen if you're Catholic if you're Protestant if you're Methodist Baptist or whatever you might be as long as you're a Christian that's the main thing Christ Christ don't look at your church you belong to because they'll all perish and go away someday and break up and they'll not be thought of anymore but the principle of Christianity is the conditions of the heart towards God and that's the thing we want like to concentrate on is to know a brother not by the church he belongs to or how he wears his clothes but what he is in his Hearts amen amen have you met beautiful people people that love the Lord people that show us said that have heard and you can see the life they live and it's a people that love the Lord amen amen and you can also see people that say they're Christian they claim to be Christian but have received an intellectual Christianity Bram in the message uncertain sound he's narrating a fiction women fictional Wom he says this sister goes to church every Sunday this sister gives her tithe her offering this sister serves in church this sister is a good sister this sister lives with her husband but begins to get along with other brothers and begins to have a different attitude because not everyone in church are Christians and she begins to listen and takes on another attitude brother she begins to act different all of a sudden she begins to see a man and she begins to see that he is more handsome than her husband and all of a sudden she says I fell in love with this man all of a sudden she says should I marry him brother Bram says she marries this man and all of a sudden she notices she finds out he is not like her husband that he is not polite like her husband but he's there already or she's there already and then she says I'm gonna look for someone else and brother Brown says she began to kill little by little that conscience that Soul inside crying because everything she had received stayed only in one place and was in her mind her intellectual never went to the heart and is if it doesn't come to the heart you can imitate a Christian you can shout that you're a Son of God but your life does not prove that you are does not prove I am that's why Jesus said to the Pharisees ohes Hypocrites you tell me good teacher good Master good Master good Master but inside your heart you hate me that is the condition you're in with your mouth you confess Hallelujah to be Christian I love my Lord my life proves I am not a Christian my life proves I hate Jesus that is hard to eat but this is the message of the hour the message we've received brother it's time go on Beyond the Veil to go beyond because one day brother when you're on your death bed that soul that soul is going to come out your mind look brotherr if you received him in your mind the day you're dying the mind will begin to die and everything you received in that mind will end but what's in the soul what is truly you will come out will shout and will say I am lost because the soul that sins Shall Perish what are you in your soul what have we received that's why Jesus tells Nicodemus Nicodemus you must be born again receive him in the soul because if you received it here you have a lot of knowledge a lot of scripture Nicodemus but you haven't received it and this thought God gave it to me for the condition or what we are going through God is has everything under control and everything helps for good for us seeing my uncle the condition he's currently in bedridden he can't speak his strength is waning but his soul is resting even the nurses are admired they say I have 10 years helping aiding people that are dying and I admire Gustavo his faith how he is at peace how he is resting in the Lord how nothing matters to him when there are people that don't want to die there are people fighting to not die they don't want to die because there's a conscience that is screaming I truly haven't been a Christian that young lady brother brandham says I told her pastor oh Pastor you a liar you deceived me my entire life you never told me the truth and I'm here dying because we don't want that we want to hear his voice that voice has sounded that voice has sounded in this day that voice has power to transform us that voice has the power to change that voice raises the dead dead in your transgressions and sins necessary to hear his voice in this morning and that he can speak to your heart because you need to be sure because the time will come that you need to be sure oh oh I can say Daniel was sure they told them we're going to put you in the Lions Den what did Daniel have he had him he had him in his heart he didn't care what he' be he was sure certainly he was sure when you are certain in God I'm gonna read one more quote you can stand if you like brother [Music] the prophet says there's where so many people today is going to be so terribly disappointed at the day of judgment to know they lived in church to know they have done good deeds know they have treated their neighbor right to know they have been loyal to the people loyal to the church and in their mind have believed that Jesus Christ the son of [Music] God and be condemned at the day of judgment how many believe brother brandom know brother I know this is tough for me this is tough for me to read it is because I see my own life I say Lord I still have so much left I fall short fall short but in this morning Lord let me accept you not an intellectual message not something intellectual that won't be but Lord in my heart father I can receive you because the word [Music] says that by one Spirit we are all B it's a spiritual baptism oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah can we pray thank you [Music] Lord father if I can accomplish only my brothers to pinch their conscience and that we can have an [Music] inventory what we really are Lord received in our hearts in the soul lord your word says they shall be known by their fruits father we cannot be deceived we don't want to be deceived we want to be certain certain in you Lord that you're there their father as a seal as a seal and when one is sealed are seal into eternity not from service to service no from Revelation to Revelation not from Jubilee to
