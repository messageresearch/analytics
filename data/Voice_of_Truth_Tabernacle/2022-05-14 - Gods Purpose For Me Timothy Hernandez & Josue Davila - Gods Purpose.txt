genesis if once you have it if you can please say amen and verse 22 we'll be reading from verse 22 and on i'd like to also thank our pastor for giving me this privilege to be up here may we also be praying for him on a safe trips in mexico i'll be reading joseph is a fruitful vine a fruitful vineyard spring whose branches climb over a wall jose fertil fertilizer with bitterness archers attacked him they shot at him with hostility but his bow remained steady his strong arms stayed limber because of the hand of the mighty one of jacob because of the shepherd the rock of israel because of your father's god who helps you who helps you los alas afiaron lanzando les fletches [Music] is who blesses you with blessings of the skies above blessings of the deep springs below blessings of the breast and womb bless blessings of the breast and womb your father's blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains of the age old hills let all these that rest on the head of joseph on the bro the prince amongst among his brothers just to make a quick prayer for allowing us to be here once again because many did not have this privilege to be able to wake up this morning but you gave at least one person tonight lord may you move in this place and may your blessings fall lord we put all this in your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen you may be seated brothers are sisters um we've been talking about joseph is that joseph really walked alone i mean with god of course but with nobody else around him you know and but joseph did walk with god you know and and joseph in his time that that you know he was sold off to those slave traders you know i can just imagine in joseph's mind you know what could have been he thinking of que costas you know and it's like he was he felt alone i mean you know he felt separated he felt like nobody cared for him you know because as as as he was walking in this you know in the desert you know in towards egypt you know all these thoughts just came to him you know all of these thoughts of loneliness you know and that's how you know many of the times i believe that you know the god of joseph jose then you know you know you're not walking alone no i don't think anybody here likes uh wants to feel lost you know or go you know joseph was lonely because you know he was alienated from his family and he felt like nobody cared for him think that you know he was like man there's just no hope for me but but let me tell you this afternoon brothers he can do as much you know as much as he did with joseph he can do with us tonight you know it's just that we open our hearts to him and let him come abide in us um i i think that that that joseph you know jose he had to somehow conquer his loneliness you know can you imagine yourself being you know separated from your family [Music] joseph had to endure hardship straight from the get-go difficulties if you're from the get-go there's a principle you know but but let me tell you something you know you know there's times that we feel like we can't it seems impossible is you know our situations seem impossible you know our circumstances seem impossible there's a circumstance you know joseph didn't focus in his troubles i believe that he was always you know focused and thinking about what god wanted um i have a from the harvard university a little statistic here then uh the harvard says according to this data those age 16 to 24 are the group most likely to report feeling lonely the 10 percent lonely feeling lonely often feel like that often or always solos you know but youth let me tell you tonight now you know that my god and i believe the god that you serve will not leave you he will not let you go from his hand you know and and you know joseph as he began you know walking you know he he might have thought like oh my brothers hated me you know and he barely escaped with his life because his brothers wanted you know and then he was put in chains you know i'm bound to other you know to other slaves you know um he marched to the desert all the way to egypt now you see a simple shepherd a simple shepherd young man you know about to enter the most civilized city you know of that day but these but the the people of uh egypt you know worshiped other gods of joseph they worship you know i don't know cows frogs you know but but he maintained his integrity with god you know and sometimes you know i mean many of us i'm not saying we are not okay you know but sometimes i feel like some of us have gone to depression you know i have gone to some sort of you know feeling anxiety or whatever it may be you know and and i i think that joseph might have felt that jesus christ but he promised he would stand with you i will go with you even to the end isaiah 41 10. you're not for i am with you be not dismayed for i am your god i will strengthen you i will help you i will uphold you with my righteous right hand no if we have the creator our problems you know there's nothing my god cannot do no i know no questions you know and and you know as we've seen that joseph you know is the type of christ you know jesus christ you know his his own brothers you know his own brothers you know just how would i say they they i guess we could say push them aside or you know they betrayed him sorry that was true and you know for joseph jose you know that emotional weights it must have been crushing on him you know how he dreamed of home it must have haunted him and maybe even blamed himself for this you know for being sent out you know he's like you know that happened to joseph you know everything that joseph went through you know it worked for good everything that you've gone through everything that i've gone through has worked for my good you know what has god done you know with our lives you know how you know how what were we what were we the people before you know joseph maybe you know he couldn't understand it or couldn't see it you know you know after being in such a lonely place you know and you know being sold and then potiphar you know and then being thrown into jail the baker and the and the butcher forgot about him or the try to say the sorry the the the cupbearer yes you know forgot about him after he told him about his dream no he said remember melissa he's still maintaining so faithful with god you know and you know everything that happened to joseph jose like we said you know serve for good company um joseph we'll see you know he he left everything behind us he left everything his family just everything familia told him you know to fulfill you know to be able to have a closer encounter with him you know to have this you know closer you know approach to him you know she'll be able to trust him you know in our situations and our problems you know i i found this this quote on the internet that you know when god has selected you let me tell you you know just give it all to me you know that's what joseph did it's a location he had to just surrender it all to god you know for the plan of god to be fulfilled you know for his plan to be able to happen i don't have it there but you can just interpret it is this and just think of that now all this is bound to speak of something it just can't be no or just say well it's just a coincidence or just merely happen that way now these things are for a purpose and you know joseph we'll see you know it wasn't a coincidence that he had to go through each and every one of these things it wasn't a coincidence that god had to take him through some point of his life you know to be able to fulfill you know fulfill what god had planned for him you know and so and and i believe that we cannot you know i myself have to just let go completely so guys so god is so great and so marvelous you know that it doesn't matter important what we may be going through he always has el siempre tiene a good outcome he always has el salvador a purpose for it amen amen amen now joseph what i will say you know he maintained his integrity you know in in in what god wanted right yeah you know and it it kind of reminds me of me you know because because joseph had to be i was always i believe occupied in doing something you know like even though he was in the prison cell even though he was wherever he was you know he was always trying to do something you know as my mom tells me you know a mind that is not not not doing anything it's you know satan's jail whatever you know um but so we always have to be doing something you know you know let's let's always be doing something for god you know seeking what god wants for my life you know and so if if i could leave you with something this afternoon it would be to not give up because joseph you know could have said oh i'll give up now you know i'll give up you know i i'll just let go you know god is just god you know but what if i just let go what's going to happen so if i could leave you with something and if you can please stand and what god you know what can god do with us you know what can god do with us what can god do with us you know so i want to leave you with that you know and to just never give up on god's word god [Applause] can you hear me brothers god bless you can give a round of applause for the lord jesus christ god bless our brother timothy if we could please open up our bibles in the book of psalms 138 percy if we could please bow our heads quickly to pray heavenly father a prepared bride buddha a pure bride blanco dressed of whites yes and that was us lord you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i don't know if it's going to be the last time we speak about joseph i want to share this with you there's a purpose for a son of god there's a and i know god is moving things [Music] [Music] about a year ago or about close to a year [Music] i came back to god and it has been very hard no no [Music] i see joseph's life he did what was right and many times and bad things happened to him that was bad we could see that his own mother died when she gave birth unto benjamin despues later on afterwards they departed him from his father separated him he's separated from his homeland and then after his own brethren wanted then once he got to egypt uh foreign after everything he went through la pena it was worth it all he was he was left to be in second in command the governor of egypt joseph prospered in all things and as we christ life we know the lord jesus christ he was hated by his own come on just like joseph was perfect forgive me brethren and rejected that the jews reject jesus amen that's right man amen i could say i'm doing things right i'm trying to do good job i have fixed up my life but then all of a sudden things come to our lives can i say well why does this happen maybe you may say i'm complaining about it you see joseph and i'm very i complain a lot [Music] there's and then we ask the question god why is it happening that break our hearts mucho we suffer a lot because we're doing things right and then we don't deserve that i think but then god didn't give it to me [Music] but then i go and say but god i'm doing things right we're gonna pull out the net why can't i have it but there's a purpose that's right yes sir thank you to god if i hadn't gone through what i went through [Music] it was my own decision and it was an incorrect decision things happen for a reason and i was saying to that brother but i remember one time my pastor told me and i said it the first time i preached yes you have questions to say what god has done in your life and we are children of god brothers we go through things that we don't understand but i give thanks unto god i give thanks unto god today's day and if things don't go trying everything better it doesn't still come out my way that's right and so maybe you may fall or you overcome that test i said once i was praying [Music] i don't know about you i don't feel like i'm the only one i had to leave that ego that pride comments start to son of god [Music] all the services we're talking to people that believe in this message right amen amen yes sir but an he had said that the children of israel had gone through babylon and i remember brother fidel caviar pentecostal i started to go to the coastal church and some of us were in the denomination for a purpose yo jonassi i was born in an iglesia del mensah uh in the message church born if i can say christian i was born a son of a pastor and emmy but a point came into my life don't they just come and say i don't know when i started to go to a baptist church [Music] they taught me a base when i was young from 13-18 i went through there [Music]

the first time i because i used to live in denver and from there i got out early your maps google maps and on google maps i was going to get that at six stars and i said i got time to be comfortable and i believe that day i got there at 7 30. there's a lot of traffic i don't know what's going on [Music] he says no you're gonna get here he's just gonna be the last one now and maybe possibly it was just okay i got discouraged i said what why is this happening and the second time in which i had preached and then i was hit with kovitz and thanks be to god e and i started to cry i said god i'm trying to do your will what is this going on i'm trying to do something good i'm not doing nothing bad [Music] and then something told me shut up yes and i said thank you god i'm still alive and god is good with us brothers amen amen we are children of god amen [Music] and i remember be that god has done so many good things in my life and why are we why are we still so ungrateful why do we
