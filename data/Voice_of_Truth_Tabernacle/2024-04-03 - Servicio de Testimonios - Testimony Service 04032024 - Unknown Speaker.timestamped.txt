[26:31] quick it's Isaiah
[26:36] 4110 it reads like
[26:56] this it reads like this fear thou fear
[26:59] thou not for I am with thee be not
[27:01] dismayed for I am thy God I will
[27:04] strengthen thee yeah I will help thee
[27:06] yah will uphold thee with the right hand
[27:08] of my
[27:14] righteousness maybe you're wondering why
[27:16] Abraham's here with
[27:20] me it's because he's the evidence of
[27:22] what I'm going to testify to
[27:27] you
[27:29] it's beautiful to have an Evidence when
[27:30] God does something for
[27:32] you and I have that
[27:37] evidence Brothers if we go back four
[27:40] years I
[27:45] remember that his leg always hurt him or
[27:47] his foot always hurt
[27:49] him maybe like for two
[27:52] years his foot always hurt
[27:57] him
[27:59] he'd come and look for us at
[28:01] night Dad he'd always
[28:05] cry
[28:08] always why
[28:14] me my heart to see him that way I
[28:16] couldn't tell him
[28:18] anything and he always took
[28:23] medicine every day three shots of
[28:25] medicine a day uh
[28:29] but one
[28:31] day he was he was
[28:34] showering and I remember that he
[28:36] came I seen him when he came out from
[28:41] showering Brothers he had something on
[28:43] his
[28:44] face something so
[28:48] beautiful i' never seen him with that
[28:50] kind of countenance
[28:52] on and he says dad he says to
[28:55] me he said God visited
[28:59] what do you
[29:00] mean God visited
[29:03] me and he told me that everything's
[29:05] going to be
[29:08] okay and I said blessed be the name of
[29:10] the
[29:12] Lord thanks be to God for being so good
[29:14] to
[29:15] us and he continued with his
[29:20] pain and then we uh some talk came about
[29:23] about having a
[29:27] surgery
[29:30] upon hearing about a surgery he just
[29:32] started to cry he would always cry about
[29:36] it and I told him oh it's just talk
[29:38] we're not it's not for sure
[29:45] yet and I asked God lord don't let him
[29:48] go to an emergency room
[29:54] or no lord they're not going to take him
[29:56] to a surgical room because your word
[29:57] says something something
[30:00] else I believe you and I know he's not
[30:02] going to go to one of those
[30:06] places we were remodeling a home where I
[30:09] was
[30:12] working and I took him for him to help
[30:17] me and my friend tells me Sammy what
[30:19] does he have wrong with his
[30:21] foot and I explained to him what
[30:24] happened and he told me take him to the
[30:26] doctor
[30:30] and I told him oh he's not going to need
[30:31] a
[30:32] doctor the Lord is going to heal
[30:35] him and my friend tells
[30:38] me do you think you're that special or
[30:42] something and that's how the devil tells
[30:44] us that we're not
[30:47] special but we are special we are
[30:50] children of God and by his grace we are
[30:55] special not make it so long I don't have
[30:58] much
[30:59] time the day
[31:03] comes when that surgery had to
[31:06] happen and he said dad I don't want to
[31:10] go we went to the surgery in
[31:14] Sacramento but he every time that we
[31:17] spoke of a
[31:18] surgery he would always cry a
[31:21] lot that day he was so
[31:24] calm I seen him and he was so
[31:26] calm
[31:28] I've seen such a beautiful piece within
[31:33] him and I went out disappointed I said
[31:36] Lord
[31:41] why I felt that God had failed me right
[31:46] then the surgery
[31:52] happened the do the doctor said the the
[31:54] boy's waking
[31:55] up do you want to go visit him
[31:59] and we went to go visit
[32:01] him he said
[32:03] Dad God visited me he told me to get
[32:08] [Music]
[32:10] up that happened after that he said dad
[32:13] will you buy me a ball sometime
[32:18] after I told him uh son whenever you
[32:21] start running I I'll buy you a ball nice
[32:24] Jersey
[32:26] whatever
[32:29] and I think it was four days
[32:31] after when he began to run
[32:34] again the Lord healed
[32:39] him so what I understood right
[32:42] then was that the Lord Works in his own
[32:45] way it wasn't the way that I wanted it
[32:48] was the way that he wanted
[32:50] it so one day some time
[32:54] passed and something came to my mind and
[32:58] I
[33:00] remember when he would ask me dad why
[33:02] did this happen to
[33:05] me and I told him
[33:07] Abraham the Lord
[33:11] wants for you to speak on what happened
[33:14] to you for you to
[33:16] testify maybe other kids are going
[33:18] through the same
[33:19] thing and they don't know where to go
[33:23] to you did know where you needed to go
[33:26] to go seek him
[33:28] the Lord did the
[33:31] work and now he's on a soccer
[33:33] team and he's one of the
[33:36] best God bless you the Lord is
[33:39] [Applause]
[33:53] good God bless you
[33:56] brethren
[34:06] I have something for the glory and honor
[34:08] of the Lord Jesus
[34:11] [Music]
[34:24] Christ God's word reads in 2 Corinthians
[34:27] 5:17
[34:40] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[34:42] a new creature all things are passed
[34:44] away behold all things are become
[34:56] new
[35:04] Brothers last
[35:10] week I was testifying to some of my
[35:21] co-workers about the life I lived in
[35:26] 1994
[35:35] and as I testified and by the time I
[35:38] finished
[35:45] testifying a voice came to my heart and
[35:47] spoke and
[35:56] said
[35:59] why haven't you testified this testimony
[36:01] you shared at your job in
[36:12] church so thought came to me and said
[36:14] you're going to have to ask for more
[36:24] time turns out when I came to receive my
[36:26] blessing the Angel of the church was
[36:31] here and I told him what happened at my
[36:40] job and I told them what do you think
[36:42] it's okay if I share this
[36:44] testimony because it's very
[36:47] dark you do
[36:56] it
[36:59] I just had the mechanics but I did not
[37:00] have the
[37:06] Dynamics he said if you didn't do the
[37:09] Dynamics there's no problem
[37:13] testify said you want me to write you
[37:15] down I
[37:19] said my brother's time run
[37:26] fast
[37:35] since my life was so
[37:37] sad I was looking for the
[37:41] way how to have
[37:44] power how to have power to have
[37:54] Revenge I would have close myself for
[37:58] dark books of the devil are or dark
[38:00] mag or uh black
[38:10] magic I studied and studied and filled
[38:12] myself with
[38:19] research when I had all the symbols the
[38:26] numbers
[38:34] I got to the point where he told me
[38:36] you're going to receive all the power
[38:37] I'll give you all the
[38:45] power but no no one gives anything in
[38:48] exchange for
[38:53] nothing for me to obtain and receive all
[38:56] the power
[38:58] he told
[39:00] me the devil told
[39:07] me we don't have any other name to call
[39:10] him Dev the devil told
[39:19] me I'll give you all the power in
[39:21] exchange for a
[39:25] child when he told me to offer him a
[39:33] child a voice in my deaths said
[39:38] stop stop
[39:45] there because that child will be
[39:51] sacrificed when that voice
[39:56] told to stop because a child would be
[39:59] for
[40:02] sacrifice I forgot about renge forg
[40:06] about I forgot about black
[40:10] magic I forgot about wanting to have
[40:18] power thank our Lord Jesus Christ
[40:24] why because the devil did not tra me
[40:28] it
[40:29] was because the Temptation was still
[40:34] there but the Lord delivered me I didn't
[40:37] do anything I just did
[40:40] research I did not use the
[40:43] Dynamics for obeying that
[40:47] voice and I can't say that voice was no
[40:50] one else but our Lord Jesus
[40:52] Christ because when he said
[40:55] stop I Clos the
[40:58] book God bless you brother and this is
[41:01] for the glory of our Lord Jesus
[41:04] [Applause]
[41:09] Christ God bless you
[41:12] Brothers I greet you in the precious
[41:14] name of our Lord Jesus
[41:18] Christ I would also like to read a
[41:21] scripture in
[41:24] EC in the Book of Ecclesiastes
[41:40] it says when thou vow a vow unto God
[41:42] defer not to pay it for he ha no
[41:44] pleasure in fools pay that which thou
[41:47] has
[41:49] vowed that scriptures Brothers I got
[41:53] it because I made a promise to God
[42:01] I made a promise to God that I was going
[42:03] to testify of his great
[42:05] power of a miracle he did in my
[42:09] life I had some time
[42:12] struggling I don't know what I had wrong
[42:17] with I went to the doctor and various uh
[42:20] doctors or Physicians looked at
[42:23] me they said I checked out fine that
[42:25] everything was health
[42:28] I also went and they did a couple
[42:29] studies on
[42:30] me and they said everything was
[42:33] fine and then they would tell me
[42:42] something they said the next option
[42:44] would be to insert one of those little
[42:46] cameras down your throat to check you
[42:50] out and then when they said the price my
[42:53] eyes got is
[42:56] huge
[42:59] but I'm gonna go I said I'm going to go
[43:01] to the doctor of
[43:03] doctors and I began to ask God
[43:06] Brothers putting my faith into
[43:12] practice but then I would see that I
[43:15] continued on the same way and there came
[43:17] the
[43:20] point that the back of my head started
[43:22] hurting my
[43:23] back and I was almost
[43:26] fainting
[43:30] many times here at church I would get
[43:32] dizzy and almost fall
[43:33] over one time almost
[43:36] leaving I found myself with two
[43:39] brothers and God guided me towards them
[43:42] for them to
[43:44] pray and I began to put that faith into
[43:46] practi but nothing would
[43:51] happen but Friday
[43:53] that that our brother Isaac was here
[43:58] that he read Isaiah
[44:05] 53 he
[44:07] the I'm going to grab a hold to
[44:11] that
[44:13] all tell you Brothers this
[44:16] evening honor of God God has healed me
[44:19] God healed
[44:20] me yesterday I called brother
[44:24] Tito to tell him that I wanted to come
[44:26] forward and testify about
[44:28] it the devil's not ever satisfied
[44:32] brother my knee started to hurt after
[44:36] that and that whole evening I had a pain
[44:39] in my
[44:41] knee I I couldn't work
[44:44] today my knee was hurting the whole
[44:49] day but I had made AOW to
[44:52] God that I was going to
[44:55] testify I took some pills and I'm
[45:00] relaxed I going to be
[45:04] testifying that he's already
[45:06] healed it's a small
[45:09] testimony it's for us to
[45:12] Contin he is Hebrews
[45:15] 13 the same God of
[45:19] yesterday that many
[45:23] times the days of Miracles have passed
[45:27] it's the same God
[45:29] Brothers he's at 24
[45:33] hours Jeremiah 333
[45:36] says cry out to me and I'll respond
[45:39] to so then Brothers many times it we're
[45:43] shy to come
[45:49] forward I get shy even though I'm up
[45:51] here singing
[45:55] and the devil doesn't want for us to
[45:58] come forward and testify what God done
[46:01] our that's small testimony I hope it
[46:03] helps
[46:05] someone take all of my heart and I say
[46:07] that God has healed me God bless you
[46:10] [Applause]
[46:22] Brothers God bless you
[46:25] Brothers
[46:35] I've been nervous all day but I still
[46:37] want to do this and I
[46:40] said what God has done for me I can't
[46:43] stay
[46:45] [Music]
[46:49] quiet as I testify to a few
[46:55] sisters
[46:58] since September I've been struggling
[47:00] with my
[47:04] health since I went to Mexico I don't
[47:06] know what
[47:14] happened when I came back my heart
[47:17] started uh jumping a
[47:21] lot it was beating too
[47:25] fast so as I was in Mexico I went to the
[47:35] doctor the doctor told me I there was a
[47:37] big issue with me and I had to come see
[47:39] the doctor as soon as I got
[47:47] back and so I went to the doctor here in
[47:49] the states and they began to do
[47:51] ultrasounds and uh
[47:54] [Music]
[47:55] exams
[48:01] and what the doctor said blood is not
[48:03] reaching your heart and your heart is
[48:04] rejecting
[48:08] it and it's very dangerous because your
[48:10] heart can
[48:13] stop when that happens you shouldn't be
[48:20] alone immediately go to the ER when you
[48:23] feel that
[48:25] way
[48:28] so all of a sudden I did begin to
[48:35] worry and more because one day showering
[48:37] my heart started beating too
[48:40] fast and I was by
[48:47] myself and all I did was get out of the
[48:49] shower and dress myself and and go to
[48:52] the bed and I said if I die I'll die on
[48:53] my
[48:55] bed
[49:00] and that's how I've been these last few
[49:07] months not long ago I went to the doctor
[49:09] and they gave me an appointment and
[49:15] said since 2018 they detected lupus
[49:24] on and they said the lupus is affecting
[49:27] your heart your
[49:31] liver and we don't know what other
[49:33] organs are
[49:37] affected they explained everything to me
[49:40] and checked
[49:45] me so if there was no bruises or spots
[49:48] on my legs my
[49:55] body
[49:59] and they said you don't have it yet but
[50:01] sooner or later you will cuz your
[50:03] swollenness is very
[50:12] severe this swellness is going to start
[50:14] to break your muscles and imagine you're
[50:16] in a lot of pain because it's very
[50:21] severe after they explained
[50:25] everything
[50:28] with a very sad face she asked me how I
[50:34] felt I looked at her and smiled and said
[50:37] everything's fine I'm not
[50:42] afraid so she just looked at The
[50:45] Interpreter and patted me on the
[50:53] back and it was on a Sunday February
[51:03] 25th I was here in church speaking to
[51:05] the Lord and I said I don't believe
[51:06] everything they told
[51:08] me I believe you can heal me you're my
[51:12] physician and he me so many times why
[51:15] can't he do it
[51:19] again so the Sunday ended and we left
[51:25] home
[51:31] and I testified to my sister for about
[51:33] two hours over the
[51:37] phone and my husband came to clean the
[51:44] church and he got to the house around
[51:46] 8:00 and he said he wanted to go to
[51:48] sleep and I told him go to
[51:50] sleep and I started praying every night
[51:54] like
[51:55] always
[51:57] and when I finished praying I went to
[51:59] the
[52:02] kitchen and I left my bed ready with the
[52:05] lights off and
[52:09] everything and I left everything ready
[52:11] to not turn the light on and wake them
[52:13] up and I closed the
[52:16] door and I was doing a few things in the
[52:21] kitchen I turned everything off when I
[52:23] was ready to go to
[52:25] bed
[52:28] and for my surprise when I opened my
[52:30] bedroom
[52:32] door there was a shining light that
[52:35] strike my
[52:38] face it was such a golden
[52:41] light that I can still remember
[52:49] it and I went to go lay down where I was
[52:52] going to go to sleep and I turned
[52:55] everywhere
[52:59] and I thought what is happening and I
[53:00] was too excited very
[53:08] happy so I looked everyone and it looked
[53:10] like I was just in the middle of a big
[53:16] light and for the glory of God since
[53:18] that day and on I have so many symptoms
[53:20] have gone
[53:23] away since that day I believe I received
[53:25] my healing
[53:30] since that day my heart hasn't uh been
[53:33] at a fast
[53:35] pace and that's my testimony I
[53:40] have and I say I can't keep this to
[53:42] myself this is too
[53:44] great and God bless you
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:55] brother
[54:00] God bless you
[54:12] Brothers the scripture says that he
[54:14] sends Angel to care for you and to keep
[54:17] you in all your
[54:21] ways he says that they'll pick you up
[54:23] before your Foote heads a
[54:25] stone
[54:27] my testimony is about my
[54:37] brother and to talk about the great
[54:39] things that God has done as a family in
[54:41] my
[54:43] family
[54:50] um when I see that through so many
[54:52] trials that we've had to go
[54:54] through I see that God has always been
[54:59] there from our first
[55:02] steps in the
[55:05] denomination then knowing Christ in the
[55:13] message I can always see the hand of God
[55:15] at our side
[55:18] always brother Brandon says in the
[55:25] message he says I promise that from this
[55:27] night
[55:29] forward that I accept my
[55:33] healing and I call things that aren't as
[55:35] though they
[55:37] were because I believe in your
[55:41] word help me Lord in the name of the
[55:44] Lord Jesus Christ
[55:53] um to say that you accept your healing
[55:55] call things out aren't as though they
[56:00] were it's something that I I speak about
[56:03] the life of my
[56:07] brother he was always very present to
[56:17] me we don't know
[56:21] what what time the spirit that he
[56:23] battled with for many
[56:25] years came into
[56:30] him from the time that my mother um
[56:34] passed on at 11 years of age he was
[56:39] 11 it was a strong hit to his life as it
[56:41] was to all of
[56:44] us but he was normally
[56:49] okay he was always happy and
[56:55] smiling
[56:57] but we didn't know how much he was
[56:58] struggling with in his mental
[57:03] health as the years went by it got
[57:13] worse but he was very cheerful he always
[57:16] had his head
[57:18] up even in the strongest draws that he
[57:22] had he always kept moving
[57:25] forward he never let
[57:28] himself and he would pray even more and
[57:30] give himself more to
[57:34] God when he fell and had his
[57:41] process it wasn't that literally
[57:44] fell he tried to
[57:48] suicide and he was unable to do it
[57:52] was because God had a
[57:55] purpose
[58:00] when he came out of all
[58:09] that God sent your angels to to keep you
[58:12] to care for
[58:14] you and he looked at
[58:17] me and he said
[58:20] no this time he didn't send his
[58:24] angels He himself SU sustained
[58:29] me it was a fall from a third step or
[58:33] from a third floor
[58:35] sorry when all of his bones and his body
[58:38] were
[58:40] broken and throughout all that
[58:48] process and the only thing that wasn't
[58:51] hurt or that didn't get hurt was his
[58:54] head he was no longer able to to touch
[58:56] his
[59:00] head he it touched his whole body but
[59:03] nothing happened to his
[59:09] head when he began his whole process in
[59:11] the
[59:15] hospital we
[59:19] always restore you he's going
[59:22] to forward put your best foot forward
[59:31] but inside of him there was no longer a
[59:33] desire to be
[59:37] here he had many years trying to go and
[59:41] be with my sister and
[59:45] mother and throughout his whole time at
[59:47] the process at
[59:50] home he disconnected
[59:53] himself he was always in contact with
[1:00:01] God when his accident happened something
[1:00:03] happened in my
[1:00:07] heart that told me that he was no longer
[1:00:10] going to be there be
[1:00:13] here but you one as a human you don't
[1:00:16] accept those
[1:00:19] things in the last
[1:00:23] week when he was going to begin rehab
[1:00:27] the strongest
[1:00:31] rehab he was going to be hospitalized
[1:00:33] for that
[1:00:37] rehab with that rehab he was going to be
[1:00:39] hooked up to machines or working with
[1:00:40] machines and
[1:00:44] doctors but a couple days
[1:00:47] before he went on to be with my mother
[1:00:50] and sister or he dreamt my mother and
[1:00:54] sister
[1:00:56] when he was going to the
[1:01:03] hospital his face with his face you
[1:01:05] could he always told you that he
[1:01:11] loved but in his face that day it was
[1:01:13] like if he was
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:21] lost a couple days happened at this
[1:01:24] rehab center or a couple days past at
[1:01:27] the and he began to get
[1:01:35] worse until they had to hospitalize him
[1:01:38] at another
[1:01:44] place the first night he was
[1:01:50] there they had given him medicine
[1:01:52] because he'd got worse or he' got ill
[1:01:54] more ill
[1:01:58] and he had a heart attack in that
[1:02:01] night he' never been sick from his
[1:02:06] heart and after this heart
[1:02:12] attack you begin you begin to tell God
[1:02:15] oh God help him take him through
[1:02:18] this but the plans of God our per
[1:02:21] they're not our
[1:02:23] plans and God's never late
[1:02:28] so many years that he suffered from this
[1:02:33] illness God had to get there at the
[1:02:35] right
[1:02:37] time many years could pass but he's
[1:02:40] never
[1:02:42] late a day
[1:02:48] passed and that day we were always
[1:02:50] connected with him through the
[1:02:54] phone
[1:02:56] his face changed
[1:03:01] drastically although he had had his
[1:03:02] heart
[1:03:06] attack but what I seen in him was
[1:03:08] something
[1:03:12] Indescribable because his face was
[1:03:14] always a very Stern
[1:03:17] face because of the spirit that
[1:03:19] tormented
[1:03:24] him when the first heart attack happened
[1:03:27] on the second his face
[1:03:34] changed we could see that God had done
[1:03:36] the work in
[1:03:37] him that Spirit had left him and it was
[1:03:40] no longer tormenting
[1:03:42] him but God had to do it that way and
[1:03:45] get in there get there at the right time
[1:03:48] could be before three years prior or
[1:03:51] five or
[1:03:53] 10 you came at the right time
[1:03:58] he was prepared and he was
[1:04:01] healed and I say that with all
[1:04:04] certainty when the second heart attack
[1:04:07] came he was
[1:04:10] ready so God's never
[1:04:14] late and I give Glory H to God that
[1:04:17] because he's always present in our lives
[1:04:20] God bless
[1:04:24] you
[1:04:29] God bless you brother are you happy
[1:04:34] brother there's no reason to be
[1:04:37] sad we in a testimony
[1:04:41] service believe the Lord is the same
[1:04:43] yesterday today and
[1:04:45] forever he continues doing
[1:04:53] wonders the Lord has also G testimonies
[1:04:56] he's helped
[1:04:57] me and told
[1:05:00] me that he is with
[1:05:03] me as evil as I
[1:05:05] am God is with
[1:05:07] me I want to share a
[1:05:11] testimony how God brought me to his
[1:05:14] feet through my son
[1:05:18] eston really I didn't want anything to
[1:05:20] do with God but brother Hector
[1:05:24] said
[1:05:26] God has his way of
[1:05:29] working many times we want to do it our
[1:05:31] own way but you
[1:05:34] can't when my son was
[1:05:37] born we've already said many testimonies
[1:05:39] of my son he burned himself he was
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:50] drowning but this time upon uh B uh
[1:05:54] birth delivery he was delivered in the
[1:05:56] wrong
[1:05:58] way and he couldn't strain
[1:06:04] up if you look at him in his booster se
[1:06:07] he was always a little crooked to the
[1:06:11] side the doctors would say that he was
[1:06:13] not going to
[1:06:16] walk that they H his
[1:06:22] vertebrae but I never surrendered I
[1:06:24] believe God and I know that sometimes
[1:06:27] God allows us to go through
[1:06:30] things so we can see God's
[1:06:34] greatness surrender to his
[1:06:38] feet I can see God's word
[1:06:40] brother that blind
[1:06:43] man when they told him who
[1:06:48] sinned so I thought that my faults my
[1:06:51] sins were uh following me but no
[1:06:57] Brethren today I'm
[1:07:00] sure that God loves every one of
[1:07:03] us and he lets us go through trials to
[1:07:08] see he is the same yesterday today and
[1:07:15] forever so I always got home from work
[1:07:17] sat down and look at him it was a
[1:07:20] sorrow as a
[1:07:24] parent you're always saying Why didn't
[1:07:26] it happen to me instead of my
[1:07:28] son you always want to fill in their
[1:07:34] shoes but God is
[1:07:39] real the devil wants us make us believe
[1:07:41] something
[1:07:44] else so he wasn't walking he couldn't
[1:07:48] walk I brother he never walked he would
[1:07:52] drag himself he would only crawl
[1:07:57] one
[1:08:00] time I asked God what should I do Lord
[1:08:04] what should I do
[1:08:06] Lord my son can't be there
[1:08:11] crawling and Something Told Me
[1:08:15] Brother tell the brothers to pray for
[1:08:17] your child that they
[1:08:20] pray God has
[1:08:23] power I was left alone speaking
[1:08:26] my many times as our brother said we're
[1:08:32] shy we're shy or embarrassed to ask for
[1:08:38] prayer or because a brother's doing
[1:08:40] things no
[1:08:43] Brethren God has given a gift to every
[1:08:45] man God gave us his
[1:08:49] word the gift is in the men

[1:09:12] with
[1:09:14] faith the elders uh got around
[1:09:18] us and they prayed for my
[1:09:20] son and the pastor told me your son's
[1:09:24] going to walk believe it and I believed
[1:09:27] it
[1:09:30] brother I never disbelieved the
[1:09:34] word I was standing up and want him to
[1:09:37] walk but he would

[1:11:26] in my
[1:11:28] marriage and
[1:11:31] family that's the
[1:11:35] greatest that God is the same yesterday

[1:11:53] martyr Steven when he was in his
[1:11:57] torture he saw the heavens open he saw
[1:12:01] Jesus sitting in his right hand waiting
[1:12:03] for
[1:12:05] him I believe God is waiting for every
[1:12:07] one of
[1:12:08] us to come to his
[1:12:11] feet God bless you
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:24] brethren God bless
[1:12:33] you my testimony is something God did
[1:12:36] for me nine years
[1:12:50] ago it all began when my mom began to
[1:12:53] congregate in a Christian Church
[1:13:00] she wanted to name me a uh another name
[1:13:03] that's actually very
[1:13:08] beautiful but her sister had more time
[1:13:10] in the
[1:13:14] message and she said why don't you name
[1:13:16] her like brother bram's
[1:13:23] daughter I believe my mother paid more
[1:13:26] attention to what God told her through
[1:13:28] her
[1:13:29] sister Shon and she named me
[1:13:34] Sharon or Rosa
[1:13:38] Sharon
[1:13:41] um I believe with all my
[1:13:46] heart since God chose for me to be
[1:13:53] here or he wasn't n
[1:14:01] happy I remember from when I was 5 years
[1:14:04] old he tried to take me off the
[1:14:10] scene A dog bit me in my face and
[1:14:16] throat and later when I was 9 years
[1:14:20] old I fell off a
[1:14:23] bicycle and almost lost my right
[1:14:29] eye and there's a lump in my brain in
[1:14:32] the back
[1:14:36] part that lasted for a while but then
[1:14:38] the Lord healed
[1:14:44] me more time passing we moved to the
[1:14:47] states
[1:14:51] um went to school had
[1:14:54] classmates
[1:15:03] I wasn't doing very well because it was
[1:15:04] a public school and it was very
[1:15:06] worldly
[1:15:09] um and more time
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:13] pass we moved to Las
[1:15:21] Cruses and I thought all that was uh in
[1:15:24] my P it was
[1:15:27] finished I was going to have no more
[1:15:32] problems being in church and in the same
[1:15:35] time in the
[1:15:38] world but once again the enemy had
[1:15:40] another
[1:15:46] plan because I was not trying to get out
[1:15:49] of that circle with my
[1:15:52] friends I would go to church
[1:15:55] I would leave my
[1:15:57] house with
[1:16:02] lies or saying I had to do homework or
[1:16:08] schoolwork until I met a
[1:16:16] person so young men young ladies Wait
[1:16:19] For Your Right Time God has somebody
[1:16:20] special for
[1:16:23] you
[1:16:25] I remember that I remember the time I
[1:16:28] spent with this
[1:16:31] person it was just uh
[1:16:35] unhealthy in my mind and I couldn't take
[1:16:37] it
[1:16:38] anymore I spoke with my
[1:16:41] father I spoke with the
[1:16:43] pastor and I said I want something
[1:16:47] different I want to get closer to
[1:16:51] God I want to serve the Lord
[1:16:53] more
[1:17:03] I remember when I made this
[1:17:09] decision the devil and All His
[1:17:13] angels attacked
[1:17:15] me with
[1:17:18] depression
[1:17:21] anxiety for more than a year and a half
[1:17:28] I remember when I spoke with my pastor
[1:17:29] and my
[1:17:32] parents they brought brother
[1:17:36] Diego and he told
[1:17:38] meon sister
[1:17:42] Sharon if you don't come to the things
[1:17:45] of
[1:17:47] God it's not going to be death in a
[1:17:52] coffin going to be spiritual death for
[1:17:54] you
[1:18:00] that night my father put salt and uh
[1:18:05] pepper and he said you need to
[1:18:10] choose God or
[1:18:17] Satan and he said think about it
[1:18:23] well you know you'll have everything you
[1:18:25] want with God if you believe
[1:18:29] it it was very tough for
[1:18:32] me it was tough for my
[1:18:36] parents but by God's
[1:18:40] grace because of the pastor's
[1:18:43] help and the
[1:18:48] prayer I made the choice and decision to
[1:18:51] follow the lord Jesus
[1:18:53] Christ
[1:18:55] brother Diego told me
[1:18:58] after it's going to be two years of
[1:19:02] healing and then five
[1:19:05] years for you to meet your
[1:19:09] husband me as a young
[1:19:14] lady never did I think that would
[1:19:18] fulfill what I thank the
[1:19:21] Lord because he gave me a wonderful
[1:19:24] husband
[1:19:26] been and because I could wait in his
[1:19:31] word I know it hasn't been
[1:19:34] easy but with his
[1:19:38] help the promises he promised
[1:19:41] me he's fulfilled
[1:19:44] them and I believe he'll continue
[1:19:46] fulfilling
[1:19:50] them I hope this is useful to other
[1:19:53] youth
[1:19:57] that you don't have anything to be
[1:19:59] looking for in the
[1:20:01] world the world ain't going to give you
[1:20:05] anything but God will give you
[1:20:06] everything you
[1:20:08] want God bless

[1:21:02] rest you don't want to get married and
[1:21:04] all
[1:21:09] that I began to look at my accounts and
[1:21:14] everything I got
[1:21:17] scared because I see that I didn't have
[1:21:19] enough um he
[1:21:23] uh
[1:21:31] thinking about preparing for the future
[1:21:33] and monetarily
[1:21:38] speaking I remember when I dislocated my
[1:21:48] shoulder I had to pay like
[1:21:52] $2,700 to the hospital
[1:21:58] and at the time I didn't have enough
[1:21:59] money for
[1:22:02] that but I think God's a
[1:22:07] businessman they say he's a God that's
[1:22:09] rich in
[1:22:15] Mercy I think that also God is Rich
[1:22:17] financially with his
[1:22:22] children I remember I asked for
[1:22:24] financial aid for
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:26] that and they didn't get back to me with
[1:22:34] anything I spoke to my mom and dad about
[1:22:36] it and they said was time to pay
[1:22:39] some and I remember the time that that
[1:22:44] happened I prayed to God a simple
[1:22:48] prayer I sincere if you can say
[1:22:53] that I said God if I've seen demons in
[1:22:56] my
[1:22:57] life then why can't I see you in my
[1:23:02] life so I made that simple prayer just
[1:23:04] like
[1:23:09] that three days after that that I was
[1:23:11] with brother sister
[1:23:16] Angie I went to go check my medical
[1:23:21] bill and there I was seeing the account
[1:23:24] where it was
[1:23:25] was and I couldn't find
[1:23:29] it there was another uh bill you could
[1:23:32] say of two years
[1:23:34] prior but that had already been
[1:23:39] paid different one so I kept
[1:23:47] looking I found that amount that was due
[1:23:49] that
[1:23:52] 2,700 and I seen that said
[1:23:57] zero and I checked on the why the reason
[1:23:59] that it
[1:24:03] gave he said that the hospital had
[1:24:05] approved me for
[1:24:08] financial taken it all away I didn't
[1:24:10] have to pay
[1:24:14] anything but as brother Hector said the
[1:24:16] devil doesn't stay
[1:24:20] satisfied I think he was testing
[1:24:23] me
[1:24:25] to make
[1:24:27] short I had a problem last
[1:24:31] year not having
[1:24:33] insurance and I got into an
[1:24:39] accident and the insurance is right now
[1:24:41] charging me around
[1:24:48] 4,000 but if God did it with my medical
[1:24:52] bills then he can do it this time as
[1:24:54] well
[1:24:55] God bless you
