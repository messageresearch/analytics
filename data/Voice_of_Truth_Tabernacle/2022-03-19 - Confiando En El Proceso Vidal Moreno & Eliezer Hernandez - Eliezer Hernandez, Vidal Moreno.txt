bless everyone [Music] to the book of genesis and hennessey's chapter 25 20 cinco or verse 20 versus uh we'll be starting on uh some we'll be making the transition into uh some uh some some other bible characters uh we'll be transitioning from rebecca to jacob and esau amen amen let us read the word and the word of god says like this and isaac was 40 years old when he took rebecca to wife the daughter of bethel the syrian of padan aram the sister to laban the syrian and isaac entreated and treated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord wasn't treated of him and rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to inquire of the lord and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elders shall serve the younger yes lord this evening to be able to be in your presence and we just ask that you manifest yourself through your word and that you would speak to your children you would look at their hearts and no and and see their needs and that you would uh that you would give to them according to their needs we ask that at the end of the service your holy name would be glorified father we set ourselves aside so that you would speak to yourself we ask this in the name of our lord jesus christ jesus christ amen amen you may be seated we just decided to uh the struggle is real amen we we see uh that um isaac and rebecca had uh he they they became husband and wife and uh you know they they desire to have children like any uh marriage would desire but you know it wasn't given to man to uh give life you know the only one that can give life is god [Music] he's the only one that can give life amen amen and we see that isaac goes in and prays to the lord you see he acknowledged that god was the only one that could give life you know and the lord heard his prayer and we see that rebecca was to conceive there was a struggle going on inside of her that this was not an external it became almost unbearable for for uh rebecca you know and she go and she inquires of the lord and she's like i want to know what's happening within me consultant seniority and the struggle is not with with the outer is you know but there's nothing wrong wrong with struggle you know i've i've grown to understand that uh the struggle is fuerza you cannot get stronger if you don't have a struggle so you're you're becoming stronger you're starting to develop but he wants you to get your strength i've tried to do what i wanted to do but that but that that doesn't work for me no no no and i don't think it'll work for any true son or daughter of god you could try whatever you want whatever you decide to do without god it will be you know when you're struggling i think a lot of us don't like to uh necessarily admit it we don't like to say when we're struggling when you begin this christian walk christiano if if you read your bible you'll understand that this the christian walk it's going to be a struggle i said he never said it was going to be easy but he said it was going to be a struggle you know and if you're not struggling every christian will have a struggle this burst that was about to take place it came with the struggle and i want to let you know that you [Music] one day you'll be doing great but the next day it seems like you're being attacked on all sides it seems like you're coming from all over the place it seems like it's a foreign invasion it is a war you say because it's the devil and god that are struggling you know and i want to share something i read one time i believe it was it was charles spurgeon charles spurgeon that said this he says that's how you know your true value is he's [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] from within was going to be determined quite a bit of things actually but it was actually the beginning of the of god's uh well not necessarily the beginning of god's people but out of them would be two nations in other words believers and unbelievers spiritual espiritualis and earthly carnales amen amen that's right i want to read verse 23. and it reads like this it is a scene and the lord said unto her let's go reverse 24 excuse me cuatro and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red all over like a hairy uh garment and they called his name esau and after that came his brother call jacob excuse me i came his brother out and his hand took hold on esau's heel especially and his name was called jacob and isaac was three score years old when she bared them and the boys grew los ninos and [Music] amen amen and i i want to talk about esau for some moments and the kind of man that he was no we read that you know the boys grew up he was an athlete amen amen he liked recreation eli he liked to do the fishing you know the hunties you know he was the strong one he was your you know he was he was a sports guy he was the one all the girls were after you know in high school that that's exactly what it is yes that's the kind of guy he was he was [Music] he appeared to be stronger than jacob mas fuerte que jacob because it says jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents so he was uh he was uh you know he was about the home anton says gustavo started la casa he was about you know the things of the house you know that that's what he likes amen amen but we see that as they grew up you see as you begin to grow in the lord listen and senor sooner or later what is inside of you what is inside of you sooner or later it will come out it'll come out your fruits that's why i believe i gotta trust the process i gotta trust the process that god has put me in here it may be a slow process time passes you see and these men these young men they begin to grow you see the desires inside of you but they begin to grow you see what is inside of you okay what you want it begins to come out it's no longer just a thought anymore but that thought becomes becomes words yeah but i mean it just it just starts with something small but it begins to develop you do what you truly are amen amen and we see it one day um if you go to um verse 30 to 32. it reads like this and esau said to jacob where it says i'll die in the quotes genesis 25 verse 30. esau had just came from a hunt and he he was hungry i can i can relate to him yes [Music] therefore i am at the point to die and what profit shall this burst ripe birthright do to me yeah i i i really like what it says there i never caught it if that doesn't happen to us a lot of times i wonder if we're not at the point of where we feel like we're gonna die and you know the question actually is yes what is it that you're hungering for what is it that you're thirsting for forget that to know but you don't get the clothes you want you don't get the shoes you want those oh you don't get the job you want yourself oh you feel like you're gonna die i stopped if i don't have him i could live without all those other things [Music] [Applause] as far as your flesh is no different from a horse or from a cow or that's right it says but your flesh is just dust of the earth like the animal correct yes he listen [Music] it says you're a slave of the devil diablo and you'll crucify the soul that's in you crucification for the bible said the soul that sin is shall die so you're a slave anyway you take it and you can't get away from it you can't get away from it but we have to make the decision i spoke about the earthly things god [Applause] hope i can catch up to him they were the children of the children of the promise and they were not excluded they were not excluded it had [Music] so genesis 25 will only be reading verse 26 i like the significance as it says in spanish i searched it in english and it doesn't say it but i put it there for my interpreter and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold of his esau's heel evoeyamados and his name was called jacob el catoma puerto [Music] and isaac was three square years old when she bare them and and just like in rebecca there is two beings in each and every one of them as well there was two natures within us there's two natures in the message communion he says [Music] i was saying this taking for myself like he was going to say william brown well 40 years ago the william branham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say william branham he was a ranked rascal ben si porque yona see the charles yella branham see because i was born of charles and ella branham portland [Music] and all the habits of the world laid right there right in me pero tambien but in there was another nature presence predestinated now the apostle paul says in romans 7 7 18 it says for i know that in me that is in my flesh [Music] no good things for to will is present within me but how to perform that which is good i find not quantized how many can identify themselves with this but the evil which i do i would not that that when i would do good evil that i when i would do good evil is present within me so that's nature he shall i find in a law i find in a law that when i would do good it was present within me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man there is another man desires the things of god we were all born with this he wanted to be first like many of us we want to be first to win everything he wanted the blessings he wanted [Music] blue eyes another i'll give you the nature of certain animals anything that is similar to us some coincidence right no no no no [Music] brown says hebrews chapter 7. as i said this morning preaching 57 el cuervo si alguna the old crow if there ever was a hypocrite it's the crow correct that's right him and the dove sat on the same part oh very similar both of them fly land they both fly they're both the empires and the doves and they both sat in the same arc set in the same roost and the old crow was satisfied when he was turned in get out of that church that he could go out there and sit on one of those old dead carcasses this crowd likes the things that are rotten he's fed off of this as much right to set on a dead animal as a crow did but it was two different natures the nature of the dove says just has a dove service is finished and he goes to eat things that are rotten because that's in his nature of the crow aura now there's also a nature that is a bit dirty yes and that's the nature at kaddish barney it says so it doesn't mean that you have to have a measuring stick in your church don't have a measuring stick here for those who behave bad if you do this if you if you measure up to these rules to that rule many times many times people will lay aside little things like that you belong to a church and the thing is still in their hearts there hasn't been a change in their hearts needed of a change in nature the thing is still in their hearts and they slip around and do it when a man has met god's requirement and been born again of the spirit of god those things are took out of his life he says could you imagine a pig a pig will go to the powell of manure no look as long to begin with he needed a change or he needs a change in his life and there is a change in his life but there has to be a change in our lives now the nature of the crow of the lamb el corderito the lamb is a very very innocent being and very pure where to go because our nature really hasn't been changed because a lamb gives up all of his rights he doesn't depend on himself depends it depends on somebody else the goats are good to jump quick here or there this is not going no any they they say something and no no no no it's not this way no no the other way things should be done like this the indian that he had a dream of that told brother branham he said brother branham i had a dream and i dreamed of two dogs one was white and one was black now we're fighting who wins in this battle the indian said oh the one i feed the most feeding the most brethren estamos are we feeding the most he won't even fit in the suit you're making the other ones skinnier [Music] [Music] um [Music] you say i don't do anything wrong to anybody no no that's not how things work a decision you take in doing your decisions [Music] [Music] i grew up [Music] or of this eagle's nest and put it there where the chickens were this eagle thought it was a chicken you would look at the rest i said [Music] but he didn't know anything else he did not know anything else but he saw everybody do the same thing [Music] [Music] [Music] you don't belong there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i am in a process they can be natural change my nature because i mean my spirit that same spirit [Music] that was in jesus christ [Music] [Music]
