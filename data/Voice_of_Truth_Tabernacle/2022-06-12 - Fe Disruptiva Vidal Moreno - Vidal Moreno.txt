[Music] i [Music] m [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] foreign [Music] god bless everyone thank god first and foremost to the book of jude chapter one capitola uno um we're still on the um on the subject of restoring the faith amen amen let us read god's word this is jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and cult scientifically i like how it says preserved incre in jesus christ it says mercy unto you in peace and love be multiplied says beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints ex to and we just ask that you speak to your europe and and that all honor and glory gloria will be to you lord by the way yes this is the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated sientos uh it's kind of been on my mind during the past uh past month uh i i want to title this message you know when we talk about something that uh that disrupts you know i i kind of want to i kind of want to um i want you to understand what what i'm speaking of when i say disrupted it indicates something you know something that that's ruptured and then something that's what you would call a a little grotesque or a rough indica uh you know and then uh on the other side you know it makes reference to a and i think that's what we want that's what we want yes so we don't come to the house of god you know to to have a small chain but you know what i don't i don't believe that you know i believe you know if i was just if i wasn't going to receive a whole lot you know i'd be going to do something that i i really like to do you know i'm actually doing something that i really like to do this is something i enjoy serving god amen foreign you know we talk about beast a lot of times we we think that it's a bad thing but but you know uh the beast can be it can be used on good terms he can be a beast [Music] jude one uh i believe it was three images you know i want to read that once again it says like this you say it's just beloved you see our mothers [Applause] is he's gonna get back up that he if he lost one battle that does not mean he lost the war the war is not defined one battle boruno he is he's the winner i just want to give some examples here you know whenever you are sleeping you know you're nice and you you know you just i don't know what what stage of sleep it is but it's there's one that's real good first thing there you go first stage third third stage is that that people don't that they don't like to they're gonna let you know you know when we come to the house of god know i think that's what god means to do yes look in your pencil case look at your skin i said oh my god he's not gonna sugarcoat things he's not he's not gonna just he's not gonna be like oh it's okay it's okay a man it's just something that's been disrupted you know and and i think that that's what he he doesn't do things by accident he does them on purpose and he allows you think god wants he was allowed to disrupt a lot of things the devil never what is it's not just i mean we could take it in so many ways and remember we don't want to lose focus on on the faith part of it it brings a lot of of complacency being complacent just you know like how would you call it when you're complacent you're you're just you're just satisfied satisfied with coming to church uh especially you know god's gotta he's gotta disrupt that no he's gotta he's gonna just you know get get a little rough sometimes yes that's right escorto you guys gotta get rough it helps i do that it does i see you know what it it helps when you when you correct because it gets their attention that's what god wants to do okay i said because you know in church what can like listen to the nemo the word for a moment and then we forgive you and it becomes a psychology this is what faith is look at la fetes what disruptive faith is contrary es lo contrario to what what the world thinks the local mundo piensata face fedex ruptiva does something different ferente amen amen and when we sit there and think about it this work esta caminata was supposed to produce some things it was supposed to it was supposed to do things that just come in the church mosque dressed in eyes putting on the jail you know it goes so much further other than that you know when we talk about it you see when you get this kind of faith you see because when nature is disrupted you know when nature is disrupted you know something happens to it you know it's like i said something's interrupted and it's not normal it's not normal to the point where people start noticing the last person but there was a there was a 7.2 earthquake in peru i believe it was uh when we were in cedar hill at new mexico you know and uh i was over here in in the united states and i heard about it because nature was disrupted i believe something [Applause] talking about [Music] the people are the children of god you know they're pretty problematic people nobody they could be good problems too they don't always have to be because you're going against what everybody believes is 96 down the very bottom it says then what about healing the stick anton says then he says greater is he that's in you amen amen outside of christ puerto you know i want to read something bro excuse me brother branham says he says greater was he that was in the hebrew children [Applause] i want to be

it's looking like it's called to do for your mother they're called to do the same thing and i was just talking about you know the seed you know about how we say where abraham seeds and i believe that yolo creole i believe we're abraham's c but that's seeds the bringing forth to the fruit fruit it's supposed to bring and how you know meaning people's always been talking about the last days and i can't remember who said it one of us caleb i can't [Music] you know whenever you know the end comes you know like i just i just got to bring it to a more uh to where you can understand because you
