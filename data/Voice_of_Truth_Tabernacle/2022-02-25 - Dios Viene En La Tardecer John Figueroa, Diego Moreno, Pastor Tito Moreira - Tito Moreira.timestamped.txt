[45:28] god bless you thank you
[45:37] amen god bless everybody johnny man
[45:42] i mean amen if you can uh open your
[45:44] bibles to the book of genesis
[45:48] chapter 24
[45:51] verse 1
[45:57] hey man i'll go ahead and read it
[46:01] and it reads like this it says
[46:04] and abraham was old and well stricken in
[46:06] age and the lord had blessed abraham in
[46:09] all things
[46:17] and abraham said unto his eldest servant
[46:19] of his house that ruled over all that he
[46:21] had put i pray thee thy hand and under
[46:24] my thigh
[46:26] edith
[46:37] and i will make thee swear by the lord
[46:40] the god of heaven and the god of the
[46:41] earth that thou shalt not take not take
[46:44] a wife unto my son of the daughters of
[46:45] the canaanites among whom i dwell
[46:51] [Music]
[46:53] on
[46:56] [Music]
[47:03] my country and to my kindred and take a
[47:05] wife unto my son isaac
[47:19] and it came to pass before he had done
[47:20] speaking that behold rebecca came out
[47:23] who was born to bethlehem milka the wife
[47:26] of nahor abraham's brother with her
[47:28] picture upon her shoulder
[47:31] uh
[47:37] [Music]
[47:44] was very fair to look upon a virgin
[47:46] neither had any man known her and she
[47:48] went down to the well and filled her
[47:50] picture and came up
[48:02] and the servant ran to meet her and said
[48:04] let me i pray thee drink a little water
[48:06] of thy pitcher
[48:14] and she said drink my lord and she
[48:16] hasted and let down her picture upon her
[48:18] hand and gave him drink
[48:26] [Music]
[48:30] sorry it was a lot of reading
[48:39] [Music]
[48:45] we find that abraham uh he he sought a
[48:48] wife for isaac
[48:53] and we see that that abraham didn't just
[48:55] want any wife for isis
[49:00] he wanted her to come from from the the
[49:02] line of believers you could say man
[49:08] and so here is abraham his days are
[49:10] numbered
[49:13] and then we see that he he brings his
[49:16] his servant
[49:19] his most trusted man
[49:24] and we see that he sends his servant
[49:27] and brother branham says in the message
[49:28] earnestly contending for the faith that
[49:30] was once delivered to the saints
[49:38] he says and hear that that abraham is
[49:40] the type of god the father
[49:56] is a type of brother brandon
[50:03] amen and we we we know that abraham
[50:06] wanted a a wife for isaac of a god from
[50:09] godly people
[50:16] amen and
[50:17] and he wanted this bride to to come from
[50:19] his his belief say man
[50:25] amen and also isaac and rebecca are a
[50:28] type of uh jesus christ in the bride
[50:34] amen so so this being said that rebecca
[50:36] came from
[50:38] from abraham's lineage
[50:42] she was a predestinated seed
[50:46] she had the word inside of her
[50:49] she was uh the bride is made of the same
[50:51] word that jesus is
[50:58] [Music]
[51:19] and so abraham knew that there would be
[51:21] a bride suitable for isaac though
[51:27] he knew that there was going to be a
[51:28] seed that needed life
[51:29] [Music]
[51:33] amen is there a seed here a man
[51:49] amen so so now we're going to move on in
[51:51] the story how how eliezer made the
[51:53] journey to get to rebecca
[51:54] [Music]
[51:58] and how uh eliezer he took camels with
[52:00] him
[52:06] [Music]
[52:17] well and he took ten ten camels hey man
[52:20] there's ten camels for one person
[52:24] hey man so he was making sure that there
[52:26] was plenty of power to make sure rebecca
[52:28] got home to isaac
[52:44] amen so he comes with all his powers
[52:47] and he gets to the well
[52:49] [Music]
[52:50] didn't just choose any bribe
[52:54] he saw a bride according to god's word
[53:01] [Music]
[53:09] [Music]
[53:26] amen there's no other way the bride must
[53:28] fulfill the scriptures
[53:31] so the camels we said that they typified
[53:32] the holy ghost
[53:35] [Music]
[53:38] so i'm going to read this this quote
[53:39] real quick from brother branham
[53:44] it's in the same message earnestly
[53:46] continuing for the faith that was once
[53:47] delivered to the saints
[53:53] now listen listen to this
[54:18] [Music]
[54:22] with
[54:34] to see jesus someday
[54:38] amen so that's another thing about the
[54:39] bride is the bride has to worship
[54:45] there's no other way brothers
[54:48] it says here in john 4 24
[55:04] she's worshiping
[55:10] but then i'm going to speed up a little
[55:11] bit here
[55:13] ellie easter comes for the purpose that
[55:14] he came for a man
[55:31] [Music]
[55:44] we as a bride have a decision to make
[55:48] [Music]
[55:59] it's decision time now
[56:05] [Music]
[56:09] is that rebecca was living in the
[56:11] evening or when they met eliezer and
[56:13] rebecca were in the evening time
[56:28] now you've got
[56:49] [Music]
[57:05] [Music]
[57:14] [Music]
[57:23] tonight you'll have to make a choice
[57:27] he goes on to say
[57:29] he says what did rebecca say
[57:32] she said i will go now
[57:36] she says praise god
[57:38] that's
[57:52] [Music]
[58:07] it says here in matthew
[58:08] chapter 24 verse 6 and 8.
[58:13] matthew 24 6 through 8.
[58:20] and it says like this
[58:22] and it says you shall hear of wars and
[58:24] rumors of wars see that you ye be not
[58:26] trouble for all these things must come
[58:28] to pass but the end is not yet
[58:39] for a nation shall rise against nation
[58:42] and kingdom against kingdom and there
[58:43] shall be famines and pestilences and
[58:45] earthquakes
[58:46] and
[58:47] diverse places
[59:02] who prophesied about this brothers
[59:06] [Music]
[59:09] brother banner prophesied about these
[59:10] things
[59:12] he prophesied about russia
[59:15] about the woman
[59:25] [Music]
[59:28] we see that that brother brown's message
[59:30] is coming to fulfillment
[59:34] and it means that we don't have that
[59:35] much time
[59:37] amen and i first when i heard about the
[59:39] war i was i was scared
[59:43] hey man i'm almost 18.

[59:52] i was thinking of maybe moving to canada
[59:53] or some some place that way
[59:56] hey man but
[59:58] but we see that brother brandon's
[59:59] message he's being fulfilled hey man
[1:00:03] so we have to make that decision hey man
[1:00:05] do you want to take this this bridegroom

[1:00:20] [Applause]
[1:00:32] i just want to read one scripture and
[1:00:34] this is
[1:00:36] genesis 24.
[1:00:39] versus
[1:00:51] they've spoken word of the lord to us

[1:01:28] and he said unto them hinder me not seen
[1:01:30] the lord hath prospered my way send me
[1:01:33] away that i may go to my master
[1:01:36] hey yo responding
[1:01:51] and they called rebecca and said unto
[1:01:53] her will thou go with this man and she
[1:01:55] said i will go
[1:01:58] when we think
[1:02:01] about the evening time
[1:02:15] we don't have much time left
[1:02:18] at principal
[1:03:07] but the same thing happens as it happens

[1:07:20] that there's not a lot of time
[1:07:24] that we must make a decision
[1:07:36] is
[1:08:04] tribulation
[1:08:06] that's right
[1:08:22] we have little
[1:08:49] where it's hard for us to make a
[1:08:50] decision

[1:08:56] god is telling them
[1:08:59] hopefully god is
[1:10:28] to be
[1:10:41] and they called rebecca and said unto
[1:10:43] her
