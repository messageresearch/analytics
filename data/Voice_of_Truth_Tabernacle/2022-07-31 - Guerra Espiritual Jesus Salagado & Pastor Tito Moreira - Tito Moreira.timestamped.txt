[21:52] to be in the house of the lord
[21:56] we know he is here
[21:59] if you may open your bibles with me
[22:04] in hebrews 4 12.
[22:44] for the word of god is quick and
[22:46] powerful and sharper than any two-way
[22:48] sword piercing even to the dividing
[22:49] asunder of soul and spirit and of the
[22:51] joints and marrow
[22:53] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[22:55] intents of the hearts
[22:59] the other one is ephesians 4 8.
[23:04] and it reads
[23:14] when he ascended upon high he led
[23:16] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[23:18] men
[23:30] a small title with our pastor spiritual
[23:33] warfare is
[24:02] holy
[24:14] when jesus was led to the wilderness by
[24:16] the spirit
[25:26] to go
[25:48] [Applause]
[26:17] [Music]
[26:33] god's word
[27:04] on this earth
[27:32] he is
[28:38] [Applause]
[28:52] [Music]
[28:54] matter
[30:35] is everywhere in the sword shining and
[30:38] shields
[30:39] perros
[31:02] a lot of attention
[31:05] what does our king need
[31:07] jesus christ
[31:14] he needs our entire
[31:46] brother and i'm wondering if the
[31:47] warriors of today are willing to open
[31:49] the way with formalism
[31:56] through our doubts
[32:26] says
[33:21] is my commandment
[34:04] etc
[34:46] brother
[35:00] [Music]
[35:14] coin
[35:16] without the love
[35:18] loss
[35:21] god gave gifts without repentance
[35:24] sometimes we make mistakes
[35:28] away
[35:36] can make an effect to one of his seeds
[36:10] that's for them to have
[36:24] if they call me hallelujah holy roller
[36:27] uh-huh
[36:29] if my name is scandalized
[36:33] the name of jesus is very scandalous
[36:37] for good and for evil for evil
[37:08] that's why sometimes the ministers are
[37:09] very well-known
[37:12] if my name is
[37:16] if they kick me on the streets
[37:20] that does
[37:34] important
[37:38] [Music]
[37:50] [Laughter]
[38:29] same spoon both of you
[38:44] the
[39:39] was tempted many times
[39:54] you have the
[40:08] yourself
[40:11] if i correct you
[40:14] that's how god speaks to me
[40:19] and i have to come in by my own will
[40:37] who do you think you are
[40:39] who do you think you are
[40:41] el dijo he said
[40:44] the father and i are one
[40:49] and that settles
[41:27] and so arriving to david's presence
[41:30] here you have it my lord oh samuel oh

[46:52] [Applause]

[47:36] ah
[48:04] the lord of
[49:00] he
[49:15] capitol
[49:16] from the first chapter of zechariah
[49:20] so the last chapter of zechariah

[51:26] [Applause]
[52:46] [Applause]
[52:57] jerusalem
[53:39] that's when he fought in the day of
[53:41] battle
[53:43] we need to understand something
[53:48] when the bible says then shall the lord
[53:49] go forth
[53:51] in english go forth that word in english
[53:54] uh
[54:07] it's not a term for coming out of a

[56:08] scripture
[56:10] from zachariah

[56:27] [Applause]
[56:33] but it shall be one day shall be known
[56:35] to the lord not day nor nigh but it
[56:37] shall come to pass at the evening time

[58:57] the king of glory
[58:59] is how you choose
[59:44] that is
[59:56] [Applause]

[1:00:54] surrounded
[1:01:08] the lord of hosts
[1:01:20] is
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:02:04] so rise against his shoulders
[1:02:07] because he wants to show us
[1:02:10] that he has a strategy
[1:02:13] that he knows
[1:02:16] he knows how to ward
[1:04:10] shall
[1:04:23] shall never be forgotten it is
[1:04:51] strong that executed
[1:05:07] the lord shall go forth as a mighty man
[1:05:11] as a mighty man
[1:05:13] and jealousy like a man of war
[1:05:17] like a man of war

[1:06:48] and see
[1:06:49] actually
[1:06:50] the fall
[1:06:52] of man
[1:06:56] began on the spiritual side
[1:07:40] the victory
[1:08:20] natural problems there are natural
[1:08:22] problems it's
[1:08:35] and this message influence
[1:08:51] you don't have a prayer card you if god
[1:08:53] will tell me what you're sitting there
[1:08:55] for you
[1:08:56] see the old me
[1:08:58] sitting there for you'll believe it
[1:09:01] you'll believe it
[1:09:04] is spiritual it's a spiritual problem
[1:09:14] notice how god must come to the
[1:09:16] revelation of a prophet
[1:09:32] especially
[1:10:14] so many preachers
[1:10:23] [Applause]
[1:10:42] simple voice
[1:10:46] it sounds like a simple voice
[1:10:50] but god sent him with a kiss
[1:10:54] beyonce
[1:13:42] your problems
[1:13:58] because it's
[1:14:40] that's right
[1:14:52] you don't know how to control
[1:15:08] that i understand my problem isn't
[1:15:10] natural our problem isn't physical
[1:15:13] isn't psychological
[1:15:16] problem is spiritual
[1:15:19] el diablo the devil
[1:15:22] has
[1:15:36] when the people of
[1:15:45] lived in the time of the lord jesus
[1:15:46] christ
[1:16:04] because they were in captivity
[1:16:09] they were in under roman captivity
[1:16:14] there was a promise that the messiah
[1:16:16] would come
[1:16:17] esperando
[1:16:46] he arrives
[1:16:52] arriving and like a baby
[1:16:55] and then he grows
[1:17:02] and he only spent time speaking of his
[1:17:03] father
[1:17:06] speaking of this kingdom
[1:17:10] i believe many were i think many were
[1:17:12] disappointed
[1:18:09] naturally
[1:18:54] isaiah says we see him with no
[1:18:56] attraction
[1:18:59] i say isaiah himself
[1:19:04] says in isaiah 54.
[1:19:20] no weapon that is formed against thee
[1:19:22] shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:19:24] shall rise against ye in judgment thou
[1:19:25] shalt condemn this is the heritage of
[1:19:27] the servants of the lord and their
[1:19:29] righteousness is of me saith the lord
[1:19:38] 42 13 and the lord shall go forth as a
[1:19:40] mighty man he shall stir up jealousy
[1:19:42] like a man of war
[1:19:46] he shall cry roar he shall prevail
[1:19:49] against his enemies
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:52] i believe that part of these prophecies
[1:19:59] were taking place while jesus
[1:20:02] was on
[1:20:15] that he sacrificed
[1:20:17] himself on the cross
[1:20:22] but the bible gives us another image
[1:20:24] from him
[1:20:28] of demons
[1:20:44] the devil also has his generals
[1:20:47] generally el diablo and the devil's
[1:20:49] generals
[1:20:51] were religious spirits
[1:20:55] that were fighting him
[1:20:58] on meanwhile you only see him
[1:21:04] praying
[1:21:13] he was fighting a spiritual war cuantos
[1:21:15] de munos how many demons
[1:21:18] cuantos demonos how many demons
[1:21:23] didn't come against him every day
[1:21:25] cuantos demons
[1:22:07] where we walk in the flesh we do not war
[1:22:09] after the flesh
[1:22:13] for the weapons of our warfare and our
[1:22:15] carnot
[1:22:17] destruction
[1:22:18] but mighty through god to the polling
[1:22:20] down of strongholds
[1:22:26] casting down imaginations and every high
[1:22:27] thing that exalted itself against the
[1:22:29] knowledge of god
[1:22:32] and bringing into captivity every
[1:22:34] thought to the obedience of christ
[1:22:50] first peter
[1:23:01] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[1:23:02] lion walketh about seeking whom he
[1:23:18] i asked myself how many of us estamos
[1:23:21] are sober
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:27] and when we say sober normal
[1:23:32] alcohol
[1:23:34] normally in a term of drug using it
[1:23:37] means that you're clean from drugs
[1:23:42] for other things
[1:23:45] your mind can't allow you to think well
[1:23:52] but in the spiritual realm
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:24:01] i asked myself how many of us are almo
[1:24:03] are full
[1:24:06] of the things of this world
[1:24:10] that don't allow us
[1:24:13] to fight against the enemy correctamente
[1:24:21] [Music]
