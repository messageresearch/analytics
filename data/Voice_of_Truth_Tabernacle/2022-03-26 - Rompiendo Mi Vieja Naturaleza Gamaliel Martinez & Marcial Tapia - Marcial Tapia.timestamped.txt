[17:14] [Music]
[17:30] [Music]
[17:39] [Music]
[17:57] and the lord gave me this
[18:00] romano marcial with our brother marshall
[18:03] we've put a a title
[18:07] called shattering our old nature basando
[18:39] and cautiously will read
[18:56] and isaac was 40 years old when he
[18:58] married rebecca
[19:03] the daughter of bethul
[19:05] the aramian of padan aram hermana de la
[19:21] isaac pray to jehovah for his wife that
[19:24] she was barren and jehovah adopted him
[19:26] and he conceived rebecca his wife
[19:29] look at the interesting part
[19:32] verse 22.
[19:39] and her children fought with henner and
[19:41] she said if so why do i live.
[19:54] and he went to inquire of jehovah and
[19:56] jehovah answered him two nations are in
[19:58] your room and two people will be divided
[20:01] from your vows
[20:06] the one people will be stronger than the
[20:08] other people and the older will serve
[20:10] the younger enclave
[20:13] celestial blessed heavenly father
[20:15] establish
[20:17] so thankful with you foreign
[20:35] [Music]
[21:27] since we're born
[21:32] [Music]
[22:15] [Music]
[23:05] i always complain about everything
[23:10] that old nature that i have
[23:14] can't be changed unless i want it to
[23:16] right
[23:20] nature comes complaining all the time
[23:25] i can put that example and it happens to
[23:27] me personally
[23:29] because pastor doesn't respond to me
[23:34] or they don't put me to preach
[25:03] [Applause]
[25:21] [Music]
[25:26] um
[25:40] doesn't have a maturity
[25:43] but if we take notice
[25:46] there is
[25:48] a maturity
[25:49] in the inner nature
[25:53] this
[25:53] uh matureness has to be floats
[25:57] because it's like
[25:59] different
[26:00] prophet tells us in different messages
[26:02] [Music]
[26:06] and i'm not going to read every single
[26:07] one of them because
[26:22] i was crying
[26:32] [Applause]
[26:51] it says now we fully know we brothers
[26:53] who search the scriptures day and night
[26:56] day and night
[27:00] who read our newspapers and listen to
[27:02] the news commentators
[27:08] this world is now in a group of two
[27:09] great spiritual forces
[27:14] both are religious forces
[27:19] and i believe that these great forces
[27:21] come to maturity
[27:24] like i said
[27:27] one or the others
[27:29] and whoever is
[27:46] i want to feed more the white dog
[27:50] let me confess to you brothers
[27:54] that sometimes it it's hard for me
[27:58] because i like the material things
[28:54] god has for me right
[29:07] and these great forces both were
[29:09] represented into these two sons of isaac
[29:24] a
[29:27] now we see in these two sons that when
[29:29] they before they were even born that
[29:32] they were at war with each other
[29:38] rebecca
[29:42] through her virgin mother well she was a
[29:44] virgin beautiful rebecca who was who
[29:46] made the righteous seeds of god's
[29:48] promise is
[30:04] they were two believers in god
[30:05] consecrated and filled with the holy
[30:07] spirit predestined to the very marriage
[30:10] by which they were united yeah
[30:13] so the prophet asked himself a question
[30:15] how is it possible
[30:20] god had
[30:53] [Music]
[31:52] one a very bad person and the other a
[31:54] very good person
[32:00] and how it was a good person seems to be
[32:02] a bad guy
[32:04] god can never change this program
[32:07] perfecto
[32:09] he makes his program perfect because
[32:10] it's of him yeah
[32:25] he changes his name
[32:30] we get that story
[32:32] we see that jacob
[32:34] stops complaining
[32:37] stops complaining
[32:43] uh complaining in the form of
[32:46] not complaining to god
[32:48] [Music]
[32:50] because in the beginning jacob
[32:53] as we know
[33:19] i don't imagine isaac told him
[34:05] when any young man comes or a young lady
[34:07] comes to me
[34:08] and christ
[34:09] and shouts he says
[34:12] and cries and tears it is a senora
[34:14] it says lord here i am
[35:13] it doesn't matter
[35:29] old nature
[35:32] the prophet says
[35:35] and like i said it's hit me yo
[35:38] i have to leave things
[35:41] in order
[35:54] it's hard for me to leave the uh
[35:56] earthy things
[35:59] hermanos it's hard for me to let go of
[36:00] things
[36:02] the more i have the more no no no
[36:04] i don't have it doesn't matter
[36:08] it doesn't fill me
[36:09] salon right now
[36:38] that one my nature
[36:40] it's maturing little by little
[36:44] the what's inside
[36:46] they say
[36:48] necessitas
[36:51] it says you have to come to a maturity
[39:00] god bless you
[39:02] [Applause]
[39:08] hey man amen
[39:51] [Applause]
[40:35] when i would do good evil as present
[40:38] with me
[40:50] for a delight in the law of god after
[40:52] the inward man
[40:54] amen
[41:15] but i see another law in my members
[41:17] warring against the law of my mind and
[41:19] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[41:21] sin which is in my members
[41:32] wretched man that i am who shall deliver
[41:35] me from the body from the body of this
[41:37] death
[41:39] gracias
[41:40] [Music]
[41:43] cristo nuestro
[41:45] senor nuestro
[41:57] i thank god through jesus christ our
[41:59] lord saw them with the mind i myself
[42:01] serve the law of god but with the flesh
[42:03] the law of sin
[42:12] it's taken a lot for me to get up here
[42:23] but i'm also a man who fears god
[42:27] and i believe his word
[42:42] holiness
[43:23] is
[43:51] is
[44:06] with those characteristics
[44:20] is
[45:58] so
