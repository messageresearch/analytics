[22:06] okay can we give a clap offense to the
[22:08] lord
[22:11] [Applause]
[22:17] it's good to be in the house of god is
[22:19] buenos aires
[22:21] everyone looks like they want to be here
[22:23] today
[22:36] thank you for this new opportunity
[22:38] gracias
[22:51] that you be with me and my interpreter
[23:38] and then genesis 24 33.
[23:46] when you have it you can say man
[23:48] understand
[23:58] so then faith cometh by hearing and
[24:00] hearing by the word of god
[24:12] and when you have it you can say amen
[24:16] amen
[24:22] here's some pages flipping still
[24:30] amen genesis 24 33 amend genesis
[24:37] and there was set me before him to eat
[24:39] but he said i will not eat until i have
[24:42] told my aaron and he said speak on
[24:58] hey man you may be seated bro
[25:02] so the context here
[25:05] is
[25:06] eliezer is eliaser wants to give his
[25:10] message
[25:14] and um
[25:16] this is very embarrassing brother but
[25:19] can you remind me the
[25:22] title of
[25:28] all right right
[25:29] our title for tonight
[25:33] who will we choose
[25:38] my subtitles
[25:43] [Applause]
[25:51] and he wanted to first give his message
[25:56] and the reason why rebecca
[26:00] rebecca later on said i will go
[26:04] it's because this message
[26:07] is produced
[26:22] so we should be thinking
[26:26] we should be stirring
[26:31] [Music]
[26:32] she's a real contender
[26:49] you know but you know
[26:51] many brothers have already shared so
[26:53] much on rebecca
[26:55] hermanos
[26:57] and brother branham refers to us as
[26:59] rebecca's also innocent
[27:03] so
[27:04] brother branham in the mess is choosing
[27:06] of a bride
[27:10] he says
[27:12] natural is type of the spiritual
[27:14] natural
[27:16] spiritual and just as you choose a
[27:18] husband and wife in the naturals
[27:27] you have to choose a husband in the
[27:28] spirit
[27:31] spiritual amen man
[27:34] and
[27:37] i want you to think of yourself as a
[27:39] rebecca quiero gusta piense como una
[27:42] rebeca because he is coming for a bride
[27:46] por que el
[27:50] yes sir so
[27:53] rebecca also had the choice
[27:58] if she wanted to go see a
[28:03] just like we have the choices
[28:07] if we want this king si queremos estere
[28:11] now i want to remind you quiro recorder
[28:26] considering my spouse seriously
[28:35] now just as rebecca was considering
[28:37] isaac
[28:42] now let us consider
[28:59] [Music]
[29:06] you must choose a man with ambition
[29:14] remember aside he loves god already
[29:21] number two
[29:36] [Music]
[29:51] they have to have a vision for their
[29:54] family
[29:58] vision for their well-being
[30:03] vision that he will provide
[30:14] and you know
[30:16] and you know god our adios has great
[30:19] plans
[30:22] planets greater than satan's mas grandes
[30:25] que los de satanas greater than mine
[30:29] greater plants than anybody hernandez
[30:34] and he's just getting started
[30:38] and god has purpose for his bride
[30:43] he has the vision for the future of his
[30:45] team
[30:48] that knows what he wants to do with his
[30:50] life in the future
[30:57] now
[30:59] in proverbs 31
[31:03] if you've read it solomon's mother is
[31:05] advising him what a king should be
[31:07] sustained
[31:14] on
[31:30] it says her husband is known in the
[31:32] gates when he sitteth among the elders
[31:35] of the land
[31:43] let me take you to revelation 4 4 now
[31:46] you don't have to look for it
[31:53] she is saying that a leader
[31:55] this is
[32:11] 24 elders
[32:15] and god sitting among elders
[32:21] are you with me
[32:25] see he's a leader
[32:28] he has motivation
[32:32] god is motivated for us
[32:36] now brother titus
[32:39] you know where uh
[32:41] wanting to choose a king
[32:44] londo de escojera
[32:46] he says
[32:47] stay away from slothful people they say
[33:09] because we don't have enough
[33:12] sufficient because we didn't see our
[33:15] future
[33:18] so we can't give the future someone else
[33:20] will desire
[33:36] he can't give us enough
[33:40] because he runs out
[33:44] did we listen
[33:49] didn't see through his future
[33:57] so he won't ever have enough for your
[33:59] future
[34:02] he cannot give you the future you desire
[34:32] hermanos the natural's the type of the
[34:35] spirits
[34:38] and
[34:39] our pastor said
[34:42] this is why
[34:43] that's why this is for serious people
[34:46] only
[34:56] how serious does it sound
[34:58] i will go
[35:00] que tan seriamente
[35:04] but it's not
[35:05] what she said
[35:11] i'm trying to
[35:13] put it but um
[35:15] rebecca
[35:16] didn't hesitate
[35:20] no
[35:23] gracias she wasn't asked twice like
[35:26] brother tyler is asking me to preach
[35:44] and they didn't ask her again
[35:49] that's why brother branham says in
[35:50] choosing a bribe
[35:54] if the if god speaks to you
[36:10] i don't know what would have happened
[36:13] but find a leader perez
[36:17] said our pastor not someone that lives
[36:19] check to check
[36:24] but god is abundant
[36:31] god has everlasting
[36:40] going back to proverbs regressando
[36:42] proverbios
[36:44] solomon's mother is saying
[36:46] la madre de salomones
[36:49] give not thy strength unto woman nor thy
[36:52] ways to that with which destroyeth kings
[37:08] amen
[37:09] so what are
[37:11] god's ways
[37:14] what are these other spouses ways
[37:18] on los caminos
[37:34] you know we say we have one spouse
[37:39] we say that only god
[37:41] is our husband
[37:46] but brother branham says
[38:03] it burns amen
[38:05] so we need to be testing all these other
[38:08] spouses
[38:15] all these other pretenders is
[38:18] pretending you know i i live in my car
[38:22] yo boy amicaro and i have pretenders on
[38:25] youtube trying to make me hear their
[38:26] music
[38:28] pretend
[38:58] we have to like to show the bachelor asi
[39:01] como el prorama el sol
[39:05] we have to test all of them amen
[39:10] see who can offer us the most
[39:20] what is what are the ways of these
[39:23] pretenders
[39:54] and where's god's future
[40:02] [Music]
[40:10] open thy mouth right judge righteously
[40:12] and plead the cause of the poor and
[40:14] needy
[40:23] see solomon's solomon's mother is saying
[40:28] that a king watches
[40:33] them that can't care for themselves
[40:49] sounds good huh
[41:04] is it to find a man of his word
[41:10] that every day says something different
[41:14] a person that isn't responsible
[41:18] personally
[41:44] god has to take care of his family
[41:59] amen
[42:01] god's word never changes
[42:06] and god has always been on time
[42:10] and god has taken care of us
[42:14] and we can't take care
[42:42] anybody
[42:52] amen amen
[42:56] [Music]
[43:10] and
[43:39] and lastly
[43:42] a humble man
[43:45] not a prideful man
[43:49] a humble king
[43:52] um
[44:06] prideful man
[44:10] someone that is humble unbreakable
[44:14] doesn't care about serving the rest
[44:19] they can stoop down
[44:32] the person that is
[44:36] amen amen
[44:39] someone that says
[44:43] someone that doesn't say forgive me
[44:47] that they know everything
[45:01] is a danger for marriage
[45:22] you know sometimes i feel like i know
[45:24] more than the interpreters
[45:28] but then god humbles me and i mess up
[45:29] too perovius
[45:35] amen amen but god humbled himself
[45:40] philippians 2 8 says
[45:44] and being found
[45:57] now i'd like to close with a short story
[46:02] story about it you can see it both ways
[46:08] choosing a husband or a wife
[46:15] brother branham says i used to go with a
[46:16] rancher that work that i work with to
[46:19] buy cattle
[46:22] um
