[22:44] testimony. Our brother Alan and I. It's
[22:47] another
[22:49] [Music]
[22:55] video. When I was young around
[23:00] 11,
[23:02] I saw my first
[23:05] miracle. And I didn't think I would
[23:08] probably survive it at first.
[23:10] [Music]
[23:12] At first I thought just like starting to
[23:14] die, feeling
[23:16] [Music]
[23:18] pain. I never felt that pain as a kid,
[23:22] ever. But that pain was really painful
[23:26] for
[23:27] me.
[23:30] And when my mom noticed, we had to go
[23:34] straight to the hospital. At the time, I
[23:36] didn't know what was going on.
[23:39] Uh then I found out I had the
[23:42] appendix, but they had to do the surgery
[23:45] the next day. So I had to have appendix
[23:48] for two whole
[23:51] days. And that was not supposed to be
[23:54] very
[23:56] common. And during after the operation,
[24:01] I still didn't feel real good. The fever
[24:03] was gone, but
[24:04] like I didn't want to eat. I didn't want
[24:08] to walk.
[24:09] I I had to get an
[24:13] IV. It
[24:15] was pain to be in there. I wanted to be
[24:21] free
[24:23] outside, hang out with my family.
[24:33] But then my
[24:34] pastor
[24:36] came for a visit, Pastor
[24:40] Mel, and he prayed for
[24:43] me. He said, "Oh Lord, please guide the
[24:49] nurse's hands to to help dear Adonai."
[24:53] [Music]
[24:55] Right after he left, he also said that
[24:57] all the other sisters and brothers was
[24:59] praying for me
[25:01] and I felt
[25:04] loved at that
[25:06] time.
[25:11] And at the end of 2
[25:15] weeks, around 2 weeks,
[25:19] uh I was
[25:20] free. And then ever since I felt like
[25:22] that was my first miracle I ever
[25:29] [Applause]
[25:33] saw. Amen. Beautiful testimony for my
[25:36] brother Adam and I. God bless him.

[27:52] another testimony
[27:55] um from our sister Rebecca.
[28:04] [Music]
[28:06] One day when I was at school, I was
[28:11] eating and
[28:13] then something
[28:16] happened and that I was that it hurted
[28:20] when I was eating my throat. It was like
[28:25] it was
[28:26] burning like there was
[28:28] fire. And then I I went to the nurse's
[28:33] office. They told me they told me that
[28:36] my tonsils were
[28:40] inflated because since my tonsils are
[28:44] really big, sometimes there's no space
[28:46] for my tonsils that when I eat it hurts
[28:50] a lot even when I drink.
[28:54] So even if I eat solids or like love
[28:59] food, it would really
[29:01] hurt. And so then they told my mom and
[29:06] she went to pick me
[29:08] up. And since she is a nurse, see, she
[29:13] went
[29:14] and told me to open my
[29:17] mouth. She told me that my tonsils were
[29:21] inflated. And so then that night we went
[29:24] to the hospital, the emergency
[29:27] room. I was
[29:30] scared
[29:32] and I didn't really like the
[29:35] feeling, but I knew I had to go in the
[29:38] hospital
[29:39] room even though I was
[29:43] scared. And then when we got in the
[29:45] room,
[29:47] um the doctors
[29:49] came. They told me that my that they
[29:53] were going to do a test on me to see if
[29:57] I ate anything bad or if I was allergic.
[30:00] They never told me why my tonsils were
[30:04] inflated, but they did told me that my
[30:07] throat was inflicted. And then that day
[30:10] I had to stay at the
[30:12] hospital for about two or 3 days.
[30:17] My dad
[30:19] came and he told me everything was going
[30:22] to be
[30:24] okay and that I was going to be all
[30:27] right. And that really touched me
[30:30] because I didn't really want to be
[30:31] there.
[30:34] And then that day when I got home, I
[30:38] went with my dad and I told
[30:41] him, I really appreciated what he told
[30:45] me cuz that really touched
[30:48] me. When he told me I was going to be
[30:51] okay, I knew God was right next to
[30:55] me, that he was always with
[30:57] me for the past three
[31:01] days, that he will always be with me
[31:03] even though when I'm on the ground
[31:05] trying to get back up on my
[31:07] feet. That I will always get up and God
[31:11] will always help me to get back up.
[31:17] Amen. What testimonies from our young
[31:20] children.
[31:21] Amen. Amen. If our song leaders could
[31:23] come up again and we're going to
[31:26] continue our

[34:33] 1 Corinthians 1:27?
[34:42] It's I'm happy to be with all of you
[34:45] today.
[34:50] So, once you have your scriptures, can
[34:51] you say amen?
[34:54] Okay.
[34:56] But God chose the foolish things of this
[34:59] world that he may might put shame to
[35:02] them that are wise. And God choose the
[35:06] weak things of this world that he might
[35:09] put the shame to the things that are
[35:11] strong. Let's pray.
[35:14] Dear Lord, heavenly
[35:17] father, this service is not only for the
[35:20] children but for everyone.
[35:24] May the children and the people receive
[35:27] something today, Lord. May it take them
[35:30] home, Lord. May they take you
[35:33] home. We ask this in the name of Lord
[35:35] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[35:40] So today we're going to be talking about
[35:41] the ordinary people.
[35:44] Oh, and also you can sit down.
[35:49] So we're going to be talking about the
[35:50] ordinary
[35:53] Everybody's ordinary here, right? No
[35:56] more clothes, no more face.
[36:03] Well, don't let Let the children answer.
[36:05] Let the children answer.
[36:11] You know the Bible,
[36:13] right? Raise your hand if you know the
[36:15] Bible. Raise your hand if you know
[36:17] ordinary people in the
[36:19] Bible who did great
[36:22] miracles. Tell me what are some of the
[36:24] miracles in the Bible that they
[36:30] did. Come
[36:32] on. That Jesus walks on water. Great.
[36:35] Anyone else?
[36:39] Nathan the
[36:41] sick. Uh Samantha or Joy.
[36:52] Yes. Isabella.
[36:54] And he resurrected. Yes.
[36:59] So, we're going to be telling the story
[37:01] to the children of what Joyce, Sister
[37:04] Joyce said, when Jesus feeds over 5,000
[37:07] people. Through who? How did it start?
[37:11] through an ordinary little boy with a
[37:13] lunch.
[37:15] That's all he fed 5,000 with a lunch.
[37:21] So first Jesus was just teaching
[37:24] everybody you know
[37:27] and they c and more and more people came
[37:29] because his words were full of truth and
[37:35] love and soon everybody was getting
[37:38] pretty hungry you know like as flesh
[37:40] everybody gets hungry.
[37:45] So then there was so the disciples said
[37:48] to the people or to Jesus, let's just
[37:52] send them out because they're getting
[37:55] pretty
[37:57] hungry. But there's nowhere else to go.
[38:00] So but Jesus had a different plan cuz
[38:03] because we all because we have to go
[38:05] against the ordinary.
[38:12] So there was a little boy with two
[38:15] loaves of bread and a five
[38:20] fish. He asked the boy to give it to him
[38:23] and and he obviously gave him because it
[38:27] because there's something about Jesus,
[38:29] huh?
[38:32] So Jesus broke the first before breaking
[38:36] the bread. Of course, you have to pray,
[38:37] huh? Like don't forget to pray. Hey,
[38:39] don't forget to
[38:41] pray. Can I every little kid, can you
[38:44] put your hands together as if Jesus were
[38:47] praying? And then he broke the
[38:50] bread and
[38:52] fish and he told the disciples to
[38:54] passing them out. He put a little piece
[38:58] of bread and put them into a basket,
[39:01] told them to spread it
[39:02] out. But for some reason, it never
[39:05] stopped coming out. It fed every single
[39:08] person
[39:10] through
[39:11] what? A
[39:13] boy and an ordinary lunch.
[39:17] And that's all.
[39:23] Look, Jesus didn't use gold
[39:26] treasures for miracles. Amazing as that.
[39:32] He just used us. one of our kind, small,
[39:37] weak.
[39:39] He used
[39:41] him to make miracles.
[39:44] He could use one of us to make miracles.
[39:51] But the first thing is just like in the
[39:53] story, we have to give him the
[39:55] bread. Give him the bread.
[40:00] There was nothing magic about the bread.
[40:02] It was about giving it to him
[40:06] that made the miracle.
[40:09] That could be that could be
[40:11] like giving your heart to God or
[40:14] worshiping him just like brother Joshua
[40:18] Abraham and Nathan
[40:21] playing the piano for God doing a
[40:24] special.
[40:30] So miracles still happen today.
[40:36] even through simple ordinary things like
[40:41] us through a
[40:44] smile through taking care of someone
[40:47] sick. It's God through
[40:50] us. It's not him doing the works, but
[40:53] it's him through us.
[40:57] He uses the weak,
[41:00] the normal people.
[41:05] the the ones
[41:07] who
[41:09] sin. He picks them up and says, "I'm
[41:12] going to use you.
[41:14] I'm going to use each and every one of
[41:16] you.
[41:23] He doesn't need the great people.
[41:27] He doesn't need kings.
[41:31] He picks the weak up, makes it better.
[41:40] He uses them as a small cup. They found
[41:44] it on They find it on a floor. It's all
[41:47] dirty. He washes
[41:49] it and make something great out of it.
[41:58] He can do what?
[42:00] He could do the powerful through each
[42:03] and every one of you. Yes, sir.
[42:07] Just offer yourself.
[42:09] Give him the bread. Give him the fish.
[42:13] And it will be a great blessing to
[42:15] everybody.
[42:21] You can take your kindness, your
[42:25] faith, your small acts of love.
[42:29] and he multiplies them.
[42:34] He takes it to every
[42:36] people in the whole world.
[42:41] He doesn't use the
[42:43] great, he uses a
[42:47] small. Even if it's just microscopic,
[42:53] there's a multitude that he can make
[42:55] from that.
[43:01] So don't be afraid to give your food.
[43:04] Okay?
[43:08] Even though it's tasty, but don't be
[43:11] afraid to give what you think is
[43:14] special.
[43:16] I mean, in reality, it is
[43:19] special, but if you give it to God,
[43:24] he'll make it giant.
[43:30] If brother uh the next preacher can come
[43:33] up.
[43:35] God is still in business of making
[43:37] miracles today
[43:40] through the small.
[43:42] Amen. Amen.
[43:51] God bless you.
[43:53] How many are happy to be here tonight or
[43:55] this afternoon?
[43:58] I know some of us are tired. I know I'm
[44:00] tired, but I'm happy to be here. I'm
[44:03] excited. Are you guys excited?
[44:06] Kids, are you guys excited?
[44:09] I'd like to read a quick scripture here
[44:12] in Jeremiah
[44:14] 15. You don't have to turn to. I'll just
[44:16] read it real quick. Before I formed
[44:19] thee, in the belly, I knew thee. And
[44:21] before thou camest forth out of the
[44:23] womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained
[44:27] thee a prophet unto the
[44:30] nations. Yes, sir. The theme for this
[44:33] afternoon is living, walking miracles.
[44:38] How many here are living walking
[44:41] miracles?
[44:44] I know I am. I know God for ordained
[44:47] something for me. I'm not sure what it
[44:49] is yet, but I'mma find out because he's
[44:52] done miracles in my life. I'm a living,
[44:55] walking miracle here where I stand.
[45:01] How many of you know the story of Moses?
[45:05] Do you guys know what the story of
[45:08] Moses? What happened when he was three
[45:10] months
[45:13] old? He was put in a
[45:15] basket and in the river.
[45:21] Correct. Yep. And Pharaoh's daughter
[45:24] found him. So Pharaoh wanted to kill all
[45:28] the little kids or the little men in the
[45:32] time of Moses when he was born.
[45:36] And he wanted to kill everyone or every
[45:38] little boy because he knew of a prophecy
[45:40] that God would bring a deliverer for his
[45:43] people.
[45:45] But Moses's mother and his father, his
[45:49] parents, they saw something in Moses and
[45:52] they said, "We have the faith that if we
[45:56] put him in the Nile River, we know our
[45:59] God will save him."
[46:01] How many you guys know what was in that
[46:03] Nile
[46:05] River? Crocodiles. So, can you guys
[46:08] imagine being placed in a river as a
[46:10] child? You can't do anything. You're
[46:13] just there in a little cradle being
[46:15] flown down the river while there's a ton
[46:17] of crocodiles trying to eat you. And not
[46:20] only dying to eat you, but they're
[46:22] eating the other children as well.
[46:25] And to be able to know that Moses was
[46:29] saved and he br was brought to the
[46:30] palace of daughters of Pharaoh's
[46:33] daughter.
[46:35] What do you guys What do you guys How
[46:37] would you guys feel if you knew your
[46:40] parents did that to
[46:43] you? Scared,
[46:46] afraid,
[46:48] confused,
[46:50] sad. I believe Moses, this is what the
[46:53] feelings Moses had when he knew what had
[46:56] happened to him after they found him.
[46:59] But Moses always knew where he came
[47:02] from. He never forgot. He always knew
[47:05] the miracle God did for him, what God
[47:09] did for him in order for him to become
[47:11] the person he needed to
[47:13] be. And Moses was saved as a child. And
[47:18] that miracle, God for ordained that to
[47:22] happen for Moses. Now, why why would he
[47:26] do that? Why would God do
[47:27] that? To save
[47:30] him? Anyone else?
[47:34] to be with him. God fore orained that
[47:37] miracle for Moses in order for Moses to
[47:40] be saved in order for Moses to deliver
[47:43] his people. See, that miracle wasn't
[47:45] just for him. It was for the entire
[47:48] people of Israel.
[47:50] It was for the entire people so they can
[47:52] be delivered from Egypt.
[47:55] And this afternoon, we're all living
[47:59] walking walking miracles here.
[48:01] How many of you have been healed or
[48:03] delivered?
[48:06] What did God do for you guys?
[48:10] He healed you. What
[48:15] else? He helped you with a math
[48:18] test. Oh, be baptized. I'm sorry. Yes.
[48:22] These are all things God for ordains for
[48:25] us. things that God allows to happen in
[48:28] order for us to do his will and in order
[48:32] for him to place us in a position where
[48:34] we can help others.
[48:36] We're all living walking miracles one
[48:38] way or another. I'll tell you a small
[48:41] testim about me. When I was in my
[48:43] mother's womb before I was even born, my
[48:47] mom was being shot at from an opposing
[48:50] an opposing
[48:51] gang. Before the womb, God had four
[48:55] ordained that I would not die that day.
[48:59] When I was just a toddler, God saved me
[49:02] from falling off a three-story building.
[49:05] When I was just a toddler, God saved me
[49:08] from drowning in a bucket. When I was
[49:10] defend defenseless, I knew I didn't know
[49:13] any better.
[49:15] God has saved me countless times
[49:17] throughout my life.
[49:19] And even as a small child, he for
[49:22] ordained those things to happen in order
[49:24] for me to be here. He forained me to be
[49:28] here in the United States. Come here as
[49:31] a child for a reason. God has a reason
[49:35] for you in order. He allows things to
[49:38] happen to you for a certain reason, for
[49:40] a purpose. Now God has already done his
[49:43] part. He's already done the miracles.
[49:45] He's already done things in your life.
[49:47] Now, it's up to you guys to find out why
[49:50] he did that, to find out that purpose,
[49:54] to find find that calling that you guys
[49:57] have. You know, God gave me a gift. And
[50:01] that gift is not just for me. It's it's
[50:04] for my people. It's for God's people.
[50:08] You know, many times we want our gift
[50:10] for ourselves. We want to be seen. But
[50:12] it's not like that. Moses had to learn
[50:14] that. He had to go to the the desert 40
[50:17] years to learn that he had to surrender
[50:22] himself to God and do it God's way, not
[50:25] his own way.
[50:29] And if we can just realize that we are
[50:32] all living walking
[50:35] miracles, pre-ordained to be living
[50:39] walking miracles.
[50:41] then that will give us that thirst that
[50:44] we need in order to find that calling
[50:47] that God has given us.
[50:50] I'm to believe that
[50:53] I already see something in the kids that
[50:55] I don't see many times in the youth.
[50:59] Sometimes I see the kids worshiping
[51:00] harder than the youth or worshiping
[51:03] harder than their parents. I see that
[51:06] genuine faith in the kids that allows
[51:09] them to have that relationship with God.
[51:13] I see that in the kids. And I'm not
[51:16] trying to bash the youth or the parents,
[51:18] but I see something special in you kids.
[51:20] There's something in you guys. You guys
[51:23] are the next generation up. You guys
[51:25] were pre-ordained for this time. You
[51:28] guys were pre-ordained to be great. You
[51:30] know, sometimes you're going to fall.
[51:32] Moses fell. Moses had mistakes, but that
[51:36] never stopped him from serving God. That
[51:38] never stopped him from trying to get
[51:40] near to God and trying to do his will. I
[51:44] see something special in you guys. And
[51:47] always remember, I am a living, walking
[51:50] miracle
[51:52] for a reason. God did it by grace. I am
[51:56] here by grace. And it's up to me to find
[52:01] out why he did that.
[52:03] God bless you.
[52:08] Living walking miracles. Who here is a
[52:10] living walking miracle?
[52:13] I don't see many living walking miracles
[52:15] here. Who here is a living walking
[52:18] miracle?
[52:20] You sound You guys sound a little bit
[52:22] too quiet. Who here is a living walking
[52:25] miracle?
[52:27] Yes, we're all living walking miracles.
[52:30] youth kids, you guys are all living,
[52:33] walking miracles. Did you know that
[52:35] you're the reason or you're the proof
[52:37] that miracles exist? That's right.
[52:41] Think about that for a second, kids.
[52:42] You're the reason that miracles exist.
[52:45] Without you, there'd be no miracles.
[52:48] Right?
[52:50] Without any of us, there would be no
[52:51] miracles at all.
[52:54] Now, let me tell you something that you
[52:56] might not know, but when you're born,
[52:59] you know, there's a slight probability,
[53:01] right? There's a slight probability that
[53:03] you might not make
[53:06] it. So, that tells me something. That
[53:10] tells me that if you're here right now,
[53:12] that alone is a miracle.
[53:15] Are you guys Are you guys listening?
[53:17] Okay.
[53:19] The the fact that you're here right now
[53:21] proves to me that you're a miracle.
[53:27] And I'm It's a statistic. I'm going to
[53:28] tell you right now. Look, it says
[53:30] globally approximately 2.3 million
[53:32] children die in the first 28
[53:39] days. So who here is a living walking
[53:42] miracle? Who here is a living walking
[53:45] miracle?
[53:47] You know, Albert Einstein, who knows
[53:49] Albert Einstein? Well, maybe we didn't
[53:51] meet him face to face, but you know, we
[53:53] know who Albert Einstein is, right? He
[53:54] was a smart person. Albert Einstein once
[53:56] said, he said this, there are only two
[53:58] ways to live your life. He says, one is
[54:02] as though nothing is a
[54:04] miracle. And the other is as is as
[54:06] though everything is a
[54:09] miracle. as if though my brother is a
[54:12] miracle, my sister is a miracle, my
[54:14] pastor is a miracle, my church is a
[54:17] miracle. How many can say amen to that?
[54:23] There's one scripture in Job 58. It
[54:26] says, and this is uh one of Job's
[54:29] friends that was telling Job this. And
[54:33] as we know the story of Job, Job got
[54:36] sick, right? He was sick. One thing that
[54:39] God did not allow Satan to do was to
[54:41] what? Touch his soul. But he can do
[54:44] everything he wanted to with his body.
[54:46] Right?
[54:49] So here is Job going through the hardest
[54:52] moment of his life. The hardest moment
[54:55] of his life. Okay? And it says right
[54:59] here, it says, "If I were you," now this
[55:02] is one of Job's friend going to telling
[55:05] Job, he says, "If I were you, I would go
[55:07] to God and present my case to him." And
[55:10] it says, "He does great things too
[55:13] marvelous to understand. He performs
[55:17] countless miracles."
[55:20] All right, I'm going to ask you once
[55:21] again, who here is living?
[55:29] Who here walks?
[55:32] Who here is a miracle?
[55:38] You know, sometimes sometimes we wait
[55:41] for
[55:42] miracles. Sometimes we're expecting for
[55:44] something great or big to happen.
[55:47] Sometimes we're in
[55:48] expectation for God to do something.
[55:53] But like our brother Alden said, he uses
[55:57] people like you, like Eli. He uses
[56:01] people like Samantha, like all of you
[56:03] here to prove that you are
[56:07] miracles, to prove that we're all
[56:10] miracles. If I could get the musicians
[56:12] to come forward, I don't have much time
[56:15] left, but I want
[56:18] to There's many miracles that Jesus
[56:20] performed. a lot of miracles and our
[56:24] kids just explained to us some of the
[56:25] miracles. But one miracle that really
[56:28] captures my eye a little bit is when
[56:30] Jesus was able to walk on water because
[56:33] not many people walked on water, right?
[56:36] Not many people were able to walk on
[56:38] water. And that alone is a miracle. It's
[56:40] a
[56:41] miracle. And so here is Jesus, right?
[56:46] Jesus
[56:49] is shows up to the disciples, right? And
[56:53] he tells the
[56:55] disciples, well, the disciples see him
[56:57] and they're afraid first of all, right?
[56:59] They're afraid of Jesus. They're they're
[57:01] not afraid of Jesus, but they didn't
[57:02] know who he was. They thought he was a
[57:04] ghost. Are you guys listening? They
[57:06] thought he was a ghost. They thought
[57:07] Jesus was a ghost. But then Jesus comes
[57:11] and he shows himself.
[57:14] He shows
[57:17] himself in the
[57:20] water. He performs a miracle in front of
[57:23] them. Shows it to
[57:25] them. But you know what? You know what
[57:27] Jesus also told his
[57:30] disciples? He says, "The same thing that
[57:33] I've done, you shall also do. The same
[57:37] thing that I did, you shall also do."
[57:41] So Jesus is telling you tonight, the
[57:43] same miracles that I did, you can also
[57:48] do. How many believe that? How many
[57:50] believe
[57:52] that? So we can't be waiting for
[57:54] miracles, brothers and sisters. We can't
[57:57] be waiting for miracles because your
[57:59] whole life is a miracle. Your whole life
[58:02] is a miracle.
[58:04] [Music]
[58:08] Maybe I'm just too excited right now. I
[58:09] can't I don't even know how to express
[58:11] myself.
[58:12] But can you look at your neighbor and
[58:14] tell him and tell them I
[58:18] I am a
[58:19] living and walking
[58:22] miracle. But say it like you believe it.
[58:25] I am a living and walking miracle. Can
[58:31] you please stand up with me this this
[58:33] afternoon? Stand up with me. We're going
[58:35] to praise the
[58:37] Lord. God is telling each and everyone,
[58:39] God is telling the kids right now, you
[58:42] are a miracle. You are a miracle. You
[58:45] are a miracle. All of you guys are a
[58:49] miracle. Yes. Me too. Yes, I am a
[58:51] miracle.
[58:53] Yes. And God loves all of us.
[58:57] So why don't we just worship him for a
[59:00] little bit and then just open to him and
[59:03] say, "God, here I am. Use me. I am your
[59:05] miracle.
[59:06] [Music]
