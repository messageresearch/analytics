TRANSCRIPT
========================================
letting go of every single dream away each one down to your feet every moment of my wandering never changes what you see hi everyone we're a growing church located in the city of Fort Collins Colorado our church family along with the pastor boost of true Tabernacle planted at the church here five years ago and has been leasing a building which has been a place of comfort and spiritual healing for many of us the past two years we've been trying to raise some funds by selling food and doing jars cells and car watching Saturdays thinking that in the near future we wanted to buy or built a church to call our own well last week talking to the awesome owner of the building he told us that he was thinking of selling the building this can be a good thing for us or not really good thing let me start with the good thing if we think positive we can buy the whole building and finally we can have a church of our own but we don't have enough money to give the downpayment right now however we will love your help to help us reach our gold the bad thing it's that if we don't obtain the money that the owner is asking for we may have to look for a different place to rent where the rank will be it's twice as much for a smaller place and some of our savings could be gone because we will have to invest in jets another rental place even if we don't end up buying this building we want to buy another one so we need all the help we can get we really need your help to reach our gold any donation that you're willing to give can be deducted out from your taxes because we're a nonprofit organization please do not with our cost we need you at this moment thank you beforehand and god bless you richly [Music]
