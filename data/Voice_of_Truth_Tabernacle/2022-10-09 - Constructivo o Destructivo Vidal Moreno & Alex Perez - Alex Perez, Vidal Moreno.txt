the following way in heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might yes and these words shall I command thee this day shall be in thine heart is diligently unto thy children and talk of them when thou cities in thine house and when that walk is by the by the way and why that when thou lie is down and when thou Rises up is and thou shall bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontless between thine eyes and now shall write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates chapter 1 verse 5 it says in the following way yes when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and then thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in thee also um we're so thankful with you Lord for the privilege that you give us to be in your presence so come here words of life because they're your words lord they're not of men they're inspired by you father and we asked you look upon the needs of your people you look at their hearts you respond according to Alex I'm here to share the word with our brother Alex and as a title um we've placed um constructive or destructive one has a family restaurant we're speaking about restoring the family when one has a home family there's always going to be an atmosphere in a home in the morning he spoke a little bit on environment that where the animals are placed where the animals are placed because not even the animals where they were going to be placed all that so that they can live in that environment amen amen but when we return to what a home is you can see that environment whether it's constructive or destructive I could have everything foreign in that atmosphere I believe that Brothers what am I going to do with them who's dead because you um you're going to be the ones that are going to demand your children amen I believe that brothers and the way that they are they are the way they are because of the way you've taught them amen amen and it's the truth when we speak about the home you have to ask yourself the question okay what environment or atmosphere am I creating for my children um testimonial I say this as a testimony I grew up in a home there was a lot of violence and also physical violence so I learned from a young age what all of that was um there's a lot of things that have remained in my mind a lot of our children haven't seen but they stayed there and a lot of times although one might or you might try to forget them it's difficult but I remember seeing my mother and in tears and as a child um and trying to tell you that everything was going to be okay I'm being having experience with those things I've seen them personally firsthand um I could have gone angry with God and have told them if there's a God then why does this happen why do these things happen if God is so good and I don't understand foreign foreign see I don't know what if they didn't teach them they didn't teach them they only show what they've been taught so many times they're they're not at fault completely right so let's learn from them rather than judge them amen amen I'm going to read a quote from them from Brother Branham foreign ER and I think it's a good thing that we put every effort we can before our children as Godly Parents make an example be an example amen amen many times we don't realize the importance of setting an example the children aren't going to learn me ties just by hearing but I personally personally speaking I'm not one of those people that can read something and then know how to do it without having some kind of an image for someone to show me how to do things speak about what the Christian Life Is But if we don't see a Christian life then many times we can't learn what's good is but we're always lowering our children's self-esteems they they can't identify but right on the country and many times they can't recover from that believe that God can do all things I come to the house of God when I come to life I always come in expectations [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] I'll go perhaps a man promised himself man is going to fail you for God and no fire he doesn't fail Brothers amen amen he said he was going to help us it doesn't matter where you live and whether it's a trailer or a Home doesn't matter what kind of a car you have God is good it doesn't matter if you don't have a question God continues as long as I can hear him God is good Brothers amen amen amen foreign when you want to build or edify someone is important it's important to recognize look at um with that person is going through this is I know that there are many sarcastic people out there and there's sometimes that people aren't enough for the sarcastic yes no one realizes that the person's already [Music] there is so much negativity with the child of God I'm going to read another another uh quote brother Brandon says this he said yes now when God gets rich and deep down here see more of God get you get down in there the more you'll believe God because there's more of him and the more you cultivate this down here the more you can believe God it's just like a child when he's a little bitty fellas maybe he doesn't know very much about it foreign from my Earthly parent amen amen be giving the place to my brother Alex but Brothers I encourage you uh I you know we're going to start there brother yes that is where the child receives my most important things that he can learn to know how to instruct them and lead him in the ways of God what happens behind those four walls of that home when the door is closed that's what determines how the children are going to live out in the real world rebounds off of those four walls because there's going to be an echo in the heart of the children what are they going to be hearing in that Echo okay that's the question I ask you are there going to be words of life or is it going to be something destructive I can go and destroy it everywhere that's what happens in in the home what's going to be what's going to manifest God bless you amazing Hermanos God bless you Brothers why don't you stand with me and open your Bibles in the Book of Luke chapter 12. verse 51 and 52. the topic is restoring the family that we placed constructivo or the destructivo on there amen you're right here bro sorry this is the word of the Lord says like this Lucas Luke 12 52. did those pages turning I'll just wait for a little bit chapter 2 verse Luke chapter 12 verse 52. this is and the scripture says Contra tres from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three is the father shall be divided against the sun and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the Mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother the word you may be seated there's a decadence in in the homes without Distortion in the homes he says something about the scripture we just read yes and this is what he says and he says and today you know that love is something that's so difficult to find foreign the Bible says that there come a time when there wouldn't be love for one another that the father would be against the mother as it is what the father would be against the mother is the mother against the fathers and the children against their parents Ikea the only love the only the only love that you'll find is amongst the chosen ones amongst the chosen ones that's correct brother random love is scarcer today are you here with me this morning score this is look at the divorce course between husband and wife meeting look at juvenile delinquents look at the home breaks in everything now the only time they even know your neighbor's dead is no I no eyes no more love [Music] tremendous what a tremendous thing we've heard are you problems there's problems in the home there's division there's a division in the home the Bible says in Deuteronomy chapters foreign and he tells him something else don't have God will be the foundation God will be in all of your life and in verse 6 he says in these words shall I command thee this day shall be in thine heart eleven a father wherever they went I I he had his children the son was getting yours the Lord is yes because this is what we have to do don't let don't forget that you have to love God imagine they're tired and they're they're fussy and he would say son daughters they have to give ourselves completely Mario god on how they should dress even even today you know our Pastor said and I will say it once again Israel isn't trying to mix us up with another race as God told him that they have to be yeah it's something impactful to be able to see that is fundamento this this is the foundation of the people of Israel that's why Psalms 102 says shall endure forever Generations you know what brothers [Music] they don't even know a song it's also hurting me the people of Israel you'll read it yo do this yes what their Roots God had done with them amen South 103. it's a very well-known song bless the Lord O My Soul even bless my entire being your police all his benefits you know what brothers we need families [Applause] you [Applause] can rest upon the promises by whatever they they feel about what they say that if the young man wants to be a young lady it's what he feels it's what he feels like dude where are we going to find the trailer where are we going to find homes in church stay with me buddy blessed be the name of the Lord God in my life God and my family amen [Applause] just call yourself a Christian to live in every one of us there was a study done a survey done did you say this is the type of home that uh that a person has in there it will affect them for the rest of their lives because I believe in the grace of God but it does influence how a young man we are such broken people right or did you fall out of the sky to me of God we need to honor our parents [Music] here's an example here is an example of how the parents that went to church influenced the future of their children in other words the parents that went to church and as a result [Music] when both parents went to church are now going to church okay peace they're just numbers take it the way 55 of the of the children assist when when only one parent but this is just to open up our minds foreign [Music] the Christian Life or continue are you with me let's turn a corner I want to finish by telling you about Josiah is a very impressive very impressive young man in the Bible he was the youngest king that that the people of Judah had a division that there was with Israel of age and now the father of Josiah his name was Ammon he was an idolater it's Gucci he was an idolatry because the father of Josiah the grand the grandfather of Josephine was Manassas Josiah's grandfather he was one of the worst kings that Judah has in fact it says you know what this guy did children this man was tremendous in his reign s he took away our worship and he grabbed a hold of horses he was one of the worst kings that Israel had had an option to follow what his uh what his uh ancestors [Music] says I was eight years old I was eight years old when he began to Reign he reigned 30 and one years in Jerusalem and this captured my attention he had his yeah [Music] a good example for them your children and know you better than the pastors you can deceive everyone else if anyone knows you it's your children they know why I haven't eaten is no cinnamon because they know us right but it captures my attention to this young man establish because every youth is looking for a guy a mentor to follow right Josiah was eight years old and I imagine yeah they resided in in the Kingdom he said who am I going to follow how am I gonna live my life that say they go to church they live more tremendously am I going to follow there am I going to follow them may God help us not perfect with at least good beginnings you are there's nothing outside of God the musicians can come forward and he did what was right in the sight of the Lord look at how young he was and he did that which was right and he walked and told him all the way of his father Hallelujah you know what this young man and he says he was an idolater and for them to just first look at that example in their home foreign [Music] who is going to be my mentor [Music] um perhaps even his great grandfather of God thank you [Music] that have been so badly he walked in the entire way of David his father and turn aside to the right or to the left wow wow what is your excuse me escusa what is oh it's because my mother was very dry perhaps but I have to I have to look for more um and realize what time you're living more dying foreign let God help us right [Music] we all have an opportunity we all have to make a decision the question is what Legacy do I want to leave for my home [Music] how do I want my grandchildren to remember me meaning Hermanos look Brothers [Music] life is so short que Los Angeles Puma that the years are going to go by so quickly and there's going to come a point where we can't do much oh yes right now is a time where you can do something for yourself right now is something it's a time where I can do something sometimes we can do something for Our Generation for your children what example they remember me when I'm gone how would they remember you [Music] what will they say about you when you're not here I don't know about you Brothers but this is about the family it's not it just it's not just if I was able to see when Israel when I was in here it's not just the immediate family didn't just worry about his immediate family Generations no they looked at the following Generations the generations that were to come doesn't come [Music] without reserves for God they gave it all for God [Music] it's worth it to serve God and the question is how will I be remembered [Music] what we do today it will have an impact tomorrow whether that be good or bad we're in the closing time of all things are searching for for men and women sons and daughters [Music] that is dying without life God bless you [Music] thank you again [Music] the few questions [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] foreign myself [Music] because yourself is that okay myself foreign foreign [Applause] is this [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] sometimes we tell our children surrender everything to God [Music] that made an effect in my heart come on Fighters come on parents let's show our children how you surrender how you completely surrender everything to God Hallelujah [Music] comigo how many of you are dios God send us his son [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] Mexico because yesterday [Music] oh foreign [Music] foreign [Music] oh I can face tomorrow because he lived amen let's go [Music] oh okay I know I just because [Laughter] foreign start Ed [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] he is worthy of our worship I am happy to see each and every one of you I'd like to ask my brother Fernando and Our Sister Alyssa to come forward it is about a it's about time their day Cameo I believe they've been waiting for this for a long time yesterday I would like to ask the father or brother Fernando's brother to please stand with us our family our brother Fernando that is visiting Mary please stand thank you brother yeah [Music] our brother Fernando and Sister Alyssa is a privilege to present them because it's a good thing [Music] to be able to say and to stand behind them correct they have done the things the correct way they have seek the correct thing and they have let themselves be guided they have been obedient is and sometimes they've been a sculptures but they have received the correction and that is the beautiful thing for a pastor and also for the parents the same way [Music] as well [Music] they can tell sister everyone to come forward as well yesterday um presentation I do things differently in every presentation and I let myself be guided by the Holy Spirit and I am happy to have him at the parents that their children have put an effort in it and they love the God above all things important I believe that's the most important thing that they love the Lord and they want to serve the Lord together they have they have the same purpose to serve the Lord the other day that I got together with the adult youth is what goals what goals do you have and our brother Fernando and Sister Alyssa they have the desire to help other youths to be used by God [Music] and I know God is going to fulfill these desires for them so God has great things and I believe the whole church is happy and they're happy for them foreign [Music] I believe he has the ring right [Music] a ring is a promise [Music] God created a ring in the sky in the heaven the rainbow is a symbol of a ring from the point of the earth it seems like like a half circle but they always take when they say so when they take pictures from the space from space The Rainbows are a circle yes that's that's the symbol that God gave to humanity Humanity for a promise that he that he has done that and I believe that the Bible shows us so when someone gets engaged or promises or engage and so where not be broken you cannot back up that's why they make sure before that uh [Music] so when they get engaged before the goal before the Lord they're officially almost married that's why when Mary was promised to Joseph he had to give her a divorcement if he was not going to marry her so and legally in the Bible when they get engaged before God there is no way of backing out of course you have to wait till the ceremony comes and behave themselves there is but I believe that they're going to do it they're going to give their word before them as you're with you being their witness because that they're getting engaged to each and every one another before God that they're going to get married um whether you put the ring on her that's okay and just say after me uh you can say Alyssa Alyssa rometto I promise that I will marry you I will marry you know in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Fernando I know I promise I promise that I will marry you that I will marry you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen sorry you guys can take each other's hands you can take it your right hands let us pray for you Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this engagement that has been taken you have taken care of them and watch over them and taking care of yes and it's a privilege as their Pastor loss to be able to present you before the president before knowing that the parents they're proud of their children [Music] I believe there's not a bigger desire that a father or mother has first of all I'll find you Lord give this person and then finally a good wife or a good husband thank you Lord because you have given it to these young people may they dedicate their lives to you Lord may you help them in their lives in their planning and their planning for their wedding and may you be with them and may you protect them and help them until they come before a minister once again so they can be married we put them in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can you give them a round of applause foreign
