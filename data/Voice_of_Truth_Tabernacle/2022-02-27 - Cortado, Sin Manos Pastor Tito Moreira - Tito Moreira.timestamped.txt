[17:42] we'll continue with the
[17:44] theme or subject of the last days
[17:48] daniel 2 36
[17:59] this is the dream and we will tell the
[18:00] interpretation thereof before the king
[18:10] thou o king are a king of kings for the
[18:13] god of heaven hath given the kingdom
[18:15] power and strength and glory
[18:18] jose hombres el campo del ciello
[18:24] el domino
[18:28] and wheresoever the children of men
[18:30] dwell the beasts of the field and the
[18:32] field and the fowls of heaven hath he
[18:33] given into thine hand and hath made thee
[18:36] ruler over them all thou art great
[18:39] thou art this head of gold
[18:49] and after these shall arise another
[18:51] kingdom and fear to thee and another
[18:53] third kingdom of brass which shall bear
[18:55] rule over all the earth
[19:04] and the fourth kingdom shall be strong
[19:06] as iron for as much as iron breaketh in
[19:08] pieces and subdue it all things
[19:36] and whereas elsa is the feet and toes
[19:38] part of potter's clay and part of iron
[19:40] the kingdom shall be divided and there
[19:42] shall be in it of the strength of the
[19:44] iron for as much as thou saws the iron
[19:46] mixed with the miry clay
[19:49] verse 44.
[20:07] and in the days of these kings shall the
[20:09] god of heaven set up a kingdom which
[20:11] shall never be destroyed and the kingdom
[20:13] shall not be left to other people but it
[20:15] shall break in pieces and consume all
[20:17] these kingdoms and it shall stand
[20:18] forever
[20:29] la plata
[20:40] for as much as i saw that the song was
[20:42] cut out of the mountain without hands
[20:44] and that it break in pieces the iron the
[20:46] brass the clay the silver and the gold
[20:49] the great god hath made known to the
[20:50] king what shall come to pass hereafter
[20:53] and the dream is certain and the
[20:54] interpretation thereof sure
[20:57] let us pray
[20:58] celestial heavenly father
[21:56] what
[22:10] it's cut
[22:38] he had was a similar image to this one
[22:42] clearly don't know exactly how it was
[22:48] we can imagine it was some similar to
[22:49] this
[23:34] that
[24:02] everything
[24:53] [Music]
[25:28] pieces the iron brass claims silver and
[25:30] gold
[25:36] the great god hath made known to the
[25:38] king what shall come to pass hereafter
[26:35] i want to put everything i have
[26:41] the end of the rest of the kingdoms
[26:44] oh hallelujah hallelujah gracias
[26:47] thanks to god
[26:50] a kingdom is
[27:04] is
[27:17] temptations
[27:47] look
[28:23] hallelujah
[28:46] [Music]
[28:55] nothing is
[29:10] first thing i want you to see
[29:13] is that this stone is cut
[29:19] and it's cut from another mountain
[29:24] so
[29:51] the church of the almighty god
[29:54] is built
[29:56] like a mountain
[29:59] built in a form of pyramids
[30:02] and it's built of a specialist
[30:05] in uh
[30:20] church
[30:22] is a mountain
[30:24] we have been built
[30:29] from the time jesus came uh
[30:33] that church was built
[30:36] first peter chapter two
[30:40] como piedras vivas as lively stones
[30:44] are built uh
[30:45] spiritual a spiritual house
[30:54] so offer of spiritual sacrifice is
[30:56] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[31:01] the church repeat the
[31:02] church is being built
[31:07] it has been built
[31:09] with lively stones
[31:13] i'm just taking what the bible says here
[32:49] even to them which stumbled at the word
[32:51] being disobedient or until also they
[32:53] were appointed
[33:49] is
[34:01] the characteristics of a living organism
[34:32] say reproduce
[34:57] whatever it is
[35:44] ephesians 2 pesos ephesians 2
[35:48] verse 20.
[35:57] see how this
[35:58] stone this city grows
[36:01] difficult
[36:09] and our role upon the foundation of the
[36:10] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[36:12] himself being the chief cornerstone
[36:16] now watch the apostle paul here uh
[36:24] ties in perfect with the apostles
[36:27] we saw what peter said
[36:33] now we're seeing what the apostle paul
[36:35] says
[36:37] in ephesians is
[36:45] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[36:46] prophets jesus christ himself being the
[36:48] chief cornerstone
[36:51] we see throughout the scriptures
[37:30] jesus christ himself
[37:32] jesus christ is the chief course
[37:48] for me
[38:17] [Applause]
[38:36] now here's where i begin to see what god
[38:37] will do in the end
[38:43] because although the bride began with
[38:45] paul
[38:47] las cosas
[38:52] things have been perverted throughout
[38:54] time
[38:56] todo lo que avenida

[39:36] [Music]
[39:39] is
[39:52] a chosen group from them

[41:15] oh
[41:24] [Applause]
[41:32] oh
[41:46] ages
[41:50] perfecto it's perfect
[41:54] because through the angels
[41:57] god's word
[42:00] las
[42:27] god had to kill all the elders
[43:24] difference
[43:31] now let's
[43:32] skip forward into the future
[43:36] to this time of day
[43:38] that we're speaking about
[43:42] the people of israel
[43:44] was perverted that's right
[43:49] turn to idols
[43:52] and
[44:13] the ten tribes from the north he takes
[44:15] them to syria syria syria syria uh syria
[44:18] yeah different syria

[48:58] penetrate
[49:08] into the dividing asunder of the soul
[49:10] and spirit and the joints of merrell and
[49:12] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[49:13] intents of the heart
