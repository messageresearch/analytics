[26:32] on the biblical characters
[26:35] for our youth
[26:38] get yourself sandal that God is using
[26:41] is
[26:43] and there's a very special character I
[26:46] like to speak about
[26:50] a very used by God and very ruthless
[26:54] the Yama
[27:04] and it means the anointed
[27:09] but I'd like to pray before we in the
[27:11] scriptures
[27:14] loving God
[27:17] before your presence okay
[27:24] we are nobody we can't do anything
[27:27] without it
[27:29] if you don't come down and bring us an
[27:33] anointing
[27:38] allow us that in this little place
[27:50] your sons and daughters
[27:54] and that we can be built up every day
[27:57] especially our youth is
[28:03] whom are special vessels and you
[28:06] continue using Lord
[28:08] in the name of Jesus
[28:15] thank you Lord
[28:17] for this moment
[28:20] or forgive our failures anything we did
[28:25] don't see our flaws Lord yeah
[28:33] God bless my interpreter
[28:38] I'm very happy that he is beside me
[28:43] one more anointed
[28:59] put something special on us
[29:02] uh
[29:06] the scripture says in first Samuel 16 1
[29:09] Samuel
[29:13] and the Lord said unto Samuel um
[29:18] how long without mourn of fores
[29:31] and go I will send thee to Jesse the
[29:36] bethlehemians
[29:39] for I've provided me a king among his
[29:42] sons
[29:51] and the Lord said
[29:55] you can have her with thee and
[30:02] I am come to sacrifice to the Lord
[30:10] to the sacrifice
[30:14] it without shall do
[30:18] and thou shall anoint unto me him whom I
[30:22] name unto thee is
[30:24] and Samuel did that which the Lord speak
[30:28] and then came to bethlehemian
[30:32] and the Elders of the Town tremble that
[30:35] is coming and said
[30:36] and the Elders of the Town tremble that
[30:38] is coming
[30:39] is
[30:46] and he said peaceably I am come to
[30:49] sacrifice unto the Lord
[30:52] sanctify ourselves
[30:54] to the sacrifice
[30:57] we're gonna stop here
[31:00] is
[31:17] from eight years old
[31:20] [Music]
[31:23] for God continues working foreign
[32:09] that was happening in this time
[32:18] that the Lord had rejected Saul
[32:23] estaba
[32:25] and he was constantly worried
[32:32] because there was a spiritual
[32:34] catastrophe he is
[32:38] and possibly a
[32:41] Ware to know that there was not a king
[32:45] place by God okay follow me although it
[32:49] was the same thing that they elected
[32:52] the people led themselves by appearance
[32:56] and that's also our title we'll be
[32:58] speaking is the theme for our youth is
[33:05] the subject for our youth God chooses
[33:07] not by appearance but by heart
[33:11] we see in the scripture
[33:17] when the Lord sends Samuel
[33:21] and he goes into Jesse's house
[33:24] in the city of Bethlehem is
[33:30] the boss Jesse was boaz's son
[33:35] you know who the mother was
[33:39] who David's mother was
[33:44] do you know who David's mother was
[33:49] la
[33:51] um
[33:53] the weather of David well is
[33:57] Jesse was David's father right
[34:05] sorry
[34:12] David's grandparents one was
[34:18] bosses
[34:22] Watch God's election how God's work with
[34:24] his children
[34:28] so we are not an exception
[34:32] we see Samuel right with fear yes
[34:40] where Jesse lived he
[34:47] and it says in verse 9
[34:50] isama
[34:53] then Jesse made shama to pay
[34:56] I know someone said is
[35:05] again Jesse made Seven of his sons to
[35:08] pass before Samuel
[35:09] is
[35:16] and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord hath
[35:19] not chosen these days
[35:24] are here all thy children
[35:57] now he was Rudy with and with all of
[36:00] beautiful countenance
[36:04] and goodly to look to and the Lord said
[36:08] all right
[36:12] said arise anoint him for he for this is
[36:16] he
[36:18] is this is tremendous
[36:22] but what impresses
[36:31] on
[36:51] the outward appearance how tremendous
[36:56] and that's what happens to us sometimes
[36:59] no
[37:12] I was young and that's what attracted me
[37:15] the natural eye
[37:18] foreign
[38:03] David was 14 years old when Samuel
[38:06] anointed him and then 15 years yeah
[39:05] and make poems write poems
[39:10] and he was a singer and author and
[39:13] he was a poet
[39:16] he had something special
[39:23] but apparently such a young man
[39:26] innovative
[39:30] harmless
[39:33] that doesn't harm anybody
[39:37] he was used by God
[39:40] like a brave Warrior
[39:42] like a decided man
[39:45] anointed by God
[39:49] and called by guard
[39:53] a young lady young man
[39:56] don't be afraid
[39:58] a
[40:00] is
[40:02] although you might be small or young
[40:06] is using and wants to use you
[40:10] yeah I believe it with all of my heart
[40:15] David full number experience
[40:18] David was a man that experimented ups
[40:21] and downs
[40:26] there's so much to learn about David's
[40:28] life is
[40:34] in the three stages of his life
[40:42] from his youth
[40:45] music
[40:49] [Music]
[40:51] we can call this David's victories
[40:55] or forgive me David's training
[40:59] we find it there in first Samuel
[41:02] chapter 16.
[41:05] and the second
[41:08] where God used him foreign
[41:26] what we see in David's third stage of
[41:29] his life
[41:35] second Samuel 11 or 20 chapter 11
[41:38] through 20.
[41:41] foreign
[41:55] foreign
[42:27] that's the way God worked with him
[42:30] God was working in his heart
[42:33] a man was I had mercy
[42:38] a man with a righteous heart
[42:42] a man with a Godly heart brother Branham
[42:45] says David's heart
[42:48] was so special he says
[42:56] in the message
[42:58] and the resurrection and the lives
[43:01] preached 1952.
[43:06] and speaks of David being a shepherd
[43:10] foreign
[43:49] and they were healed
[43:52] this is
[43:54] what a beautiful type today Amigos
[43:57] listen friends
[43:59] I have an entire Saddleback
[44:02] and I'm gonna pour it on the Limestone
[44:06] Jesus Christ The Rocks
[44:10] you sheep that are ill commission
[44:16] and you'll surely get better
[44:18] just like anything else
[44:26] a lot of search and such Church
[44:30] mm-hmm
[44:31] this is
[44:36] part of the calvary he said
[44:42] and they will get better
[44:45] this is
[44:51] and if there's ever been a time that
[44:54] sheep are here
[44:55] and we should begin to leak
[45:00] please stop brother
[45:03] no though
[45:06] don't doubt young man young lady that
[45:08] you're a son
[45:11] never doubt or fear that God can't use
[45:18] maybe 10 11 12 years old
[45:23] and I felt a lot of compassion for them
[45:26] although I was young
[45:28] foreign
[45:33] I was compassionate for people that were
[45:36] hurting
[45:37] or that we're homeless
[45:40] or something
[45:43] my heart would break
[45:46] so I say
[45:48] if you don't feel that
[45:51] you need to go to the river
[45:54] and cry and and give yourself because
[45:59] if you don't have that feeling there's
[46:01] something wrong
[46:03] something else is
[46:06] something else is filling your heart
[46:10] and the devil is
[46:12] using God's word
[46:17] that the other things are more important
[46:19] and not the Lord
[46:21] if you are here
[46:24] not because your parents came
[46:27] not because your parents come to church
[46:31] no but because God elected you
[46:36] and he wants you to come not because
[46:40] God chose you
[46:42] God bless you brother
[46:46] [Applause]
[46:51] Hermanos
[46:55] Jesus Christ
[46:58] it's a pleasure to be here
[47:02] I give thanks to God
[47:07] for the opportunity and I've always told
[47:09] Brother Titus
[47:11] for for the choice
[47:17] I'm going to retake this scripture first
[47:19] Samuel chapter 16.
[47:22] and from there we'll go to Psalms 144.
[47:25] Samuel
[47:29] Saul
[47:38] how long will that morning
[47:42] seeing that I have rejected him
[47:44] from reigning over Israel
[47:47] fill that horn with oil even and go
[47:50] temperature is
[47:56] for I have provided me a king among his
[47:59] sons
[48:01] now Psalms 144.
[48:04] verse
[48:06] yeah
[48:10] and this will be my Center
[48:13] my main scripture
[48:16] this is the psalm of David and it says
[48:19] like this
[48:22] blessed be the Lord my strength
[48:26] and pay attention to this
[48:29] which teacheth my hands to work and my
[48:34] fingers to fight
[48:36] my goodness and my Fortress
[48:44] and he and whom I trust
[48:48] do with my people under me
[48:53] but I like the translation of of this
[48:56] this Bible
[48:57] in this last uh paragraph they say is
[49:06] my people
[49:09] yeah
[49:42] to cry
[50:23] continue his work rebelliousness
[50:45] of this man named Saul
[50:49] so then
[50:51] yendo
[50:53] As Time passed
[50:58] or when God tells Samuel
[51:01] to the the house of Jesse because from
[51:05] there I have elected
[51:08] that will be the the the the king of my
[51:11] people but he tells them
[51:16] the first one you see is
[51:23] Samuel gets there is
[51:26] and Jesse gets his wife
[51:31] gets his children together
[51:34] I imagine he gets the workers together
[51:39] and the other one that doesn't cry there
[51:41] is
[51:44] the only one didn't call was David
[51:46] that's yes
[51:49] so then
[51:51] they are unite muchas look many times
[51:55] the same human being is the one who
[51:59] discredits
[52:01] the one who disqualified the one who
[52:04] excludes the human being
[52:07] by his physical appearance
[52:09] and this is what happened with Samuel
[52:12] and with Jesse and with everybody that
[52:15] gathered there
[52:19] as one by one went forward
[52:23] the sons of Jesse
[52:26] is
[52:32] he was looking at this young man
[52:35] over there
[52:37] in the fields probably sitting down
[52:42] Corazon
[53:42] foreign
[54:04] that's the truth amen
[54:07] wow
[54:14] so then
[54:17] one by one goes forward all seven
[54:20] children and all of them
[54:23] they all did not qualify
[54:26] for them
[54:30] have the credentials but for God
[54:35] he was according to his heart
[54:39] entonces so then
[55:25] it's different
[56:10] observe how he trains them
[56:15] foreign
[56:18] we were thinking again of another by the
[56:21] name of David dioses
[56:23] training David
[56:25] when he was just a little boy
[56:30] the prophet came up and poured oil on
[56:32] his head and anointed
[56:38] because God was going to train David to
[56:40] be a mighty warrior immediately
[56:43] at the training he gave him
[56:48] I was reading some time ago up here at
[56:50] Green's Mill
[56:53] where I usually go pray where God said
[56:56] to David
[56:57] I took you for the ship codes
[57:01] from following those few ships of your
[57:04] fathers
[57:05] and I made you a great name
[57:08] like the great men of earth
[57:13] and I think of the rugged training he
[57:15] did to David in
[57:51] so that he can get him quiet
[57:55] so he can listen to God
[58:00] that's still Small Voice
[58:05] then once in contact with with God
[58:09] he becomes Fearless then important
[58:17] that he don't care what anyone says
[58:22] he's been in the presence of God
[58:25] he knows God
[58:27] and the power of his resurrection
[58:32] God begins to train him
[58:39] David did not go to school of life
[58:43] he didn't go to the school of characters
[58:49] but he went to the school of God yes
[58:52] it's yours made
[58:56] made Stones rain
[58:58] from Heaven's there with us
[59:01] that God that opened the Seas this is
[59:04] yours
[59:07] almost extermination like Egypt
[59:12] well clean this world
[59:19] be quiet and still this is defeated
[59:42] [Music]
[59:52] God shows them how to use
[59:58] he faces that giant foreign
[1:00:19] but look
[1:00:22] David wants and more
[1:00:25] yeah learn how to use his hands
[1:00:31] he knew how to use that slings
[1:00:38] he's ready for the next level
[1:00:41] go and take the story
[1:00:47] yeah
[1:00:57] look maybe it'll sound a little bit
[1:00:58] weird
[1:01:02] makes himself an expert to use it
[1:01:05] I think he makes himself blood thirsty
[1:01:08] someone who is a ruthless
[1:01:11] but for his enemies
[1:01:14] he
[1:01:19] didn't touch his heart
[1:01:22] to fight these Palestines
[1:01:29] he like to cut heads
[1:01:37] he didn't put limits on God
[1:01:41] my time is ending
[1:01:44] I like this that my brother Vidal shared
[1:01:46] with me
[1:01:50] Los curiosos the curious
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:57] the curious are not satisfied
[1:02:00] with yesterday's victories or
[1:02:03] achievements
[1:02:05] they rarely lower their guard in the
[1:02:09] search like silencia Excellence
[1:02:13] does not take time away from Innovation
[1:02:17] Elite teams
[1:02:23] not rest on their Laurels
[1:02:26] as a result of their of great success
[1:02:33] they will enjoy a brief celebration
[1:02:36] learn from the experience
[1:02:39] and then move on to the next mission
[1:02:43] I believe David was a curious
[1:02:46] he was a curious person
[1:02:52] he wasn't just satisfied
[1:02:55] or just the experience of today
[1:02:59] he didn't just stay with us settle with
[1:03:02] just killing that bears
[1:03:12] even now look look
[1:03:14] when
[1:03:19] David wanted to
[1:03:22] um
[1:03:25] tell the daughter of Saw
[1:03:28] ask for ask for her hand says
[1:03:36] go go and bring me
[1:03:39] for foreskins a hundred four skills
[1:03:44] but David knew that GAR was
[1:03:56] he knew that God
[1:03:59] it has an abundance
[1:04:08] not limit God
[1:04:17] the greatness of that gun
[1:04:20] and there was women singing
[1:04:23] killed a thousands yes
[1:04:35] it wasn't a mediocre
[1:04:42] God
[1:04:58] that's right
[1:05:00] that's right let's not limit him
[1:05:03] let let us let him use us
[1:05:08] that great warrior David
[1:05:11] that's what he was called foreign that's
[1:05:15] why he was anointed he knew
[1:05:19] who was with him
[1:05:23] that God was greater than the rest God
[1:05:26] bless you
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:37] [Applause]

[1:05:45] a man
[1:05:49] adios Hermanos do you love God brother

[1:06:19] there are times that something happens
[1:06:21] in our lives
[1:06:24] and we wonder about parentola
[1:06:28] but in all things God has a purpose
[1:06:36] and all things work for good for them
[1:06:38] that are called according to his purpose
[1:06:46] I believe we love God in this evening
[1:06:50] the word says
[1:06:54] that does not love does not know God
[1:06:57] because God is love when
[1:07:00] how many of you believe God is love

[1:08:40] of the future

[1:09:00] um
[1:09:05] the tallest man who would only was as
[1:09:08] tall as this

[1:09:16] outward appearance of the future kingso

[1:10:30] Goliad and this is where Goliath shows
[1:10:33] up
[1:10:35] and challenge the children of Israel
[1:10:39] and God's word says
[1:10:44] heard this giant it is
[1:10:56] no man's heart fall because
[1:11:17] and he a man of war from his
[1:11:20] son

[1:11:30] own also and there came a lion and a
[1:11:32] bear it
[1:11:36] took a lamb out of the

[1:11:42] him
[1:11:43] and delivered it out of his mouth
[1:11:46] and when he arose against me

[1:11:55] and smoke and slew him
[1:12:00] thy servants slew both the lion

[1:14:30] youth
[1:14:48] Queens who is your giant Kenneth who is
[1:14:53] your Goliath
[1:14:57] I've asked myself this
[1:15:02] is
[1:15:03] sometimes we believe our own Giants
[1:15:07] are our parents
[1:15:10] or your brothers or your pastor
[1:15:16] or the person sitting next to you
[1:15:20] know
[1:15:22] sometimes we're mistaken yeah
[1:15:25] and we blame everybody
[1:15:29] to our lives
[1:15:38] and we don't realize
[1:15:40] going to claim is we don't realize
[1:15:45] we're truly facing against
[1:15:48] amen
[1:15:52] your um
[1:15:54] personally myself
[1:16:01] I've struggled with this
[1:16:08] I noticed which one was my Giant
[1:16:12] mascares
[1:16:17] and I noticed that Giants found out that
[1:16:20] that giant was me
[1:16:26] I myself was ruining my life
[1:16:34] I was destroying my life was myself
[1:16:45] use who is your giant
[1:16:50] sometimes want to blame everyone else
[1:16:52] Tomar
[1:16:58] tomorrow we don't want to take things
[1:17:02] or be responsible for things
[1:17:09] which one is your giant
[1:17:12] who is your Goliath
[1:17:16] I repeated that many times to myself
[1:17:21] I remember when I was far from God
[1:17:25] I began to complain
[1:17:28] because it was this place
[1:17:33] is
[1:17:34] why I'm here
[1:17:44] I'm in this condition
[1:17:49] foreign
[1:17:52] and sometimes you have to
[1:17:55] come back to yourself yes
[1:18:01] the only thing that's bothering Our
[1:18:03] Lives sometimes
[1:18:05] are are ourselves
[1:18:08] because we don't
[1:18:10] allows
[1:18:12] we don't allow God to say
[1:18:16] we want to do it our way
[1:18:21] we want everyone else to think the way
[1:18:23] we do
[1:18:25] we always want to be right
[1:18:29] there's a dispute a fight
[1:18:32] we always want to be Prince
[1:18:35] I think that everyone else is wrong
[1:18:43] that's not the way it is sometimes
[1:18:46] let's accept that we make mistakes
[1:18:54] I remember I was Fed Up
[1:19:00] and little by little guard started to
[1:19:02] work in my life

[1:19:13] wanted to feel his presence
[1:19:23] because my mother told me to go
[1:19:26] and I would show up and nothing would
[1:19:28] happen
[1:19:30] I didn't even care what the brothers
[1:19:32] told me

[1:20:06] you're a son of God
[1:20:08] man
[1:20:10] right
[1:20:12] and I got to the point where
[1:20:14] I feel God again
[1:20:18] I don't feel God even if I wanted to but
[1:20:22] I had to fix my my business
[1:20:28] I had to accept I was the only one
[1:20:30] hindering myself
[1:20:31] and that giant was me
[1:20:36] was able to unmask this
