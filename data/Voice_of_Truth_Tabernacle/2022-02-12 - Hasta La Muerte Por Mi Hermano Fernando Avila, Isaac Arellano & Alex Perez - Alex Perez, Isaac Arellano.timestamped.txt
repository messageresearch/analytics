[28:18] you guys hear us isaac
[28:22] amen
[28:23] just follow my lead bro you got this
[28:26] it's a blessing to be here amen
[28:29] i thank god for his promises and
[28:31] blessings in my life
[28:34] keep it up though no god god will never
[28:37] will never forsake one of his children
[28:39] amen
[28:42] that's right in times of uh trouble in
[28:44] times of need he is there with us
[28:50] hey man i'm not sure if i shared it
[28:51] before
[28:55] i'm happy and i'm honored to be a part
[28:57] of this church
[29:02] we are blessed to have a pastor
[29:06] uh whom we see god in amen
[29:25] i i remember uh like maybe four months
[29:27] after moving here
[29:30] there i would call my dad still
[29:33] yeah
[29:34] and and and tell him what i was going
[29:36] through
[29:38] my problems
[29:45] don't you have a pastor over there and i
[29:47] was like i'm like yeah but i mean
[30:18] so if my dad was tired of the burdens i
[30:19] gave him you know alien cannot
[30:42] and it says like this
[30:44] then chose him
[30:46] all the plane of jordan and lord journey
[30:49] east and they separated themselves the
[30:51] one from the other entonces
[31:00] abraham dwelled in the land of canaan
[31:03] and la doll in the cities of the plane
[31:05] and pitch his tent towards sodom rama
[31:08] campo
[31:16] hey man let's
[31:42] amen amen you may go ahead and take a
[31:44] seat
[32:10] [Music]
[32:26] uh
[32:27] plata they were rich in gold ricos and
[32:30] otto and they were rich in uh in cattle
[32:33] tambien and they both they both had so
[32:36] much
[32:37] possession
[32:39] in the same place
[32:55] and thresholds
[32:58] and among other things
[33:01] so abraham said let's go ahead and and
[33:04] separate
[33:07] and what's outstanding to me
[33:11] is that abraham is it afram let um lot
[33:14] take the decision of where to go
[33:21] if you go left situta
[33:30] and the bible says that a lot looked out
[33:32] into the outskirts into the city
[33:36] of
[33:50] maybe that would be great for my channel
[33:54] beneficiary
[33:55] so he goes off to saturday
[34:00] and sodom's is in the planes
[34:10] and abraham stays in canaan before he he
[34:14] he goes on yeah
[34:18] so
[34:32] every time god
[34:49] i believe abraham placed himself in the
[34:51] hands of god
[34:52] who established
[34:54] that's why he told lot to make the the
[34:56] decision but i saw that
[34:58] this is in god's hands
[35:06] [Music]
[35:41] you want to have one foot in the church
[35:47] in the world
[35:49] but god says you cannot have two masters
[35:54] it's either you serve me
[36:00] [Music]
[36:11] india i i lived in that area of
[36:13] hollywood
[36:15] hollywood i was maybe like 40 minutes
[36:17] away from there
[36:20] and uh it's very eye capturing it's very
[36:22] entertaining to be out there
[36:35] is
[36:50] you know it's uh
[36:51] and i'm gonna bring it i'm gonna bring
[36:53] it home i'm gonna make it a little bit
[36:54] personal for us the youth here
[36:59] there's uh
[37:00] at times we we we separate ourselves
[37:05] from one another the nosotros
[37:09] and i've said it before it's sometimes
[37:11] it's because we think we're better than
[37:13] our brother
[37:16] we think we're better than our sisters
[37:20] you know i'm a separate from this person
[37:22] because i don't like them
[37:26] from this person because they have a bad
[37:27] attitude
[37:31] from this person because we both like
[37:33] the same girl
[37:34] it's a personal
[37:37] you know that's not the separation that
[37:39] abraham and lot did
[37:44] we actually need one another
[37:48] because the
[38:16] we separate from the wrong things
[38:21] separate from god
[38:25] we love those who despise us
[38:28] one more time we love we love more of
[38:30] those who despise us
[38:34] than those who actually love us
[38:38] and i could i could just imagine lot
[38:40] yeah my father not alone when he was
[38:42] looking out into uh jordan to sodom what
[38:57] he probably saw more possessions in his
[38:59] hands
[39:02] but brother branham says that the word
[39:04] romano brandon says
[39:09] all that lead
[39:40] or five towns against fortes
[39:44] and in the war and in in that war
[39:48] is uh is held hostage not hostage sorry
[39:50] uh captive lost
[39:54] him and his family and all of his
[39:56] family
[39:58] you know and that is it's like that with
[40:00] us
[40:02] sometimes we go with our flesh desires
[40:07] we want to be out in the world
[40:36] and like i said abraham
[40:39] gave lot the decision to choose where
[40:43] lopez
[40:46] and that's the same as god giving us
[40:48] free will yes la mesmo dios dandonos
[40:59] [Music]
[41:02] god doesn't force me to serve him
[41:08] you know and what amazes me about the
[41:10] story we keep reading
[41:14] abraham
[41:16] found out
[41:18] that
[41:28] you know abraham didn't say
[41:30] i'm not going to go into war afraid
[41:42] he didn't say that the bible actually
[41:44] didn't say that he went to rescue his
[41:46] nephew
[41:50] the bible says that he went to go rescue
[41:51] his brother
[41:55] so abraham i could just imagine abraham
[41:58] amen
[42:19] [Applause]
[42:28] i will
[42:29] [Music]
[42:38] facing hard trials facing hard times
[42:42] instead of being
[42:55] you actually deserve everything you're
[42:57] going through
[43:00] but we shouldn't be like that i don't
[43:02] know the videos
[43:08] yo let's tell them get up brother where
[43:10] is
[43:21] [Music]
[43:37] you figure yourself out
[43:40] you know
[43:41] we want to be blessed by god
[43:45] you don't want to be a blessing to
[43:47] others
[43:51] we all know that we're a blessing to
[43:52] someone amen
[43:56] god placed us in someone's life
[44:00] because that person needed you
[44:02] persona
[44:04] you know
[44:05] 34 yeah
[44:09] [Music]
[44:12] for those says the lord god
[44:15] behold i even
[44:16] i even
[44:18] even i will both search my sheep and
[44:20] seek them out
[44:28] as a shepherd seek us out his flock in
[44:30] the day
[44:31] that he that he is among
[44:33] his sheep that are scattered so will i
[44:36] seek out my sheep and will deliver them
[44:38] out of all the places where they have
[44:39] been scattered in the cloudy and dark
[44:41] days
[45:01] he did it once already
[45:17] perfection and la pre casona perfection
[45:20] i'm a reader fast if you can follow
[45:22] along bro
[45:24] abraham
[45:26] lot his cousin had backslid and you you
[45:28] see the real true spirit of christ i
[45:30] hope you get it no matter how far he had
[45:33] backslid
[45:34] when he was in trouble he came abraham
[45:37] here came abraham with him in army the
[45:39] aliens around about through the valleys
[45:42] of sodom had come down and had took
[45:44] sodom and it's keen
[45:46] abram
[45:57] problemas
[46:14] when he looked down and saw that the
[46:16] enemy had taken away his blood relation
[46:22] he formed an army of his own servants
[46:40] he formed a legend of angels and came to
[46:41] the earth to pursue the devil
[46:46] overtook hallelujah
[46:50] this person now we love him for that
[46:53] foreign
[46:54] [Music]
[47:07] let's not be a burden to our brothers
[47:11] in galatians it actually says and
[47:13] galatas and siddhis in order to fulfill
[47:15] the law of god
