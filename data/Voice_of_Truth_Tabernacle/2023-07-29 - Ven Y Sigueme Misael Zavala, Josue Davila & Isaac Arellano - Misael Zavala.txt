El Corazon through them [Music] Mira [Music] nada oh yeah [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] God said yes [Music] [Music] God bless you Brothers if you can open up your scriptures with me first Kings 19 15. watching us through the internet in Mexico and in Mexico California in California and in other places it says like this is and the Lord said unto him go return on thy way to the Woodlands of Damascus and when thou come is anoint has yelled to be king over Syria yes he says 16. and jehu the son of name she shout out anoint to be king over Israel and Elijah the son of Jeff anoint to be prophet in thy room foreign you may be seated my brothers along with myself come follow me the last time we've seen how Elijah oh he got to the cave Napoleon but Elijah wasn't running because he couldn't overtake Jezebel or anyone else says there was a prophecy how Jezebel would die a little further on power is more than what God had given Elijah but there was a scripture that had to be fulfilled why because God fulfills what he speaks right I'd like to read a second-handed robe preaching 56. is now God's seeing foreseen that Elijah's days were numbered that he had so long that he that he could stay on the earth as everyone has so he was going to have a successor to Elijah and when he did God called this man he wasn't in no Cemetery when God called him he was plowing in a field with the Yoke of ox doing the service taking care of his mother and father God called him to be a successor of Elisha or Elijah is that they was going to harass me up at the school they thought there was surely going to be a successor they thought they was going to wear his robe as soon as he was finished with it but God does the calling neither can we take nearly can we add one thing to our statue by taking thoughts foreign you come to church my parents bring me this is a purpose foreign to where he wants them to go that's why I did he just changed Messengers but the Same Spirit Elijah and Elijah he says how I wish I had time to enter it tonight to notice that when God had called the old Tire Prophet off the field he'd preached against Jezebel under worldly crowds ahabs and leaders Association and ministerial associations and everything so he was tired and God was going to take him home so we just brought him down to the river we are having a lot of time here and that time that time is determined by God you can make plans to live 100 years God is the one who gives life that's why we have to walk because we don't know if they're going to call us tomorrow for the following weeks or in 10 years he continues saying he must have took it back you just throw it across him he must have taken it back because it fell from his shoulders when he went up no I say you're not here by coincidence because there was also an Elijah in this time with the message but it also must be believed hearsay he did what he said to exercise that recuerdo estaba foreign foreign [Music] and I said yeah that's fine they prayed when they finished I told them will you allow me to pray and they said yes so I lifted up my hands and I made a prayer he is when I finished my prayer anointing of the Holy Spirit and there on the street they had a Revival a seed exactly because they took out their songs and there as just as Elijah God honored his true word the true word of God 1920. this is and he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said let me I prayed he kissed my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have I done to thee and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of The Oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered unto him making the valley full of ditches preached in 1956 now and when he's seen he was going to take Elijah Elijah went and found Elijah plowing in the field and he took off his robe and threw it on him and he knew he was called to be the prophet we see here a Heavenly calling Elijah didn't have to preach so much it was a supernatural calling professor then to show how a prophet is he took the yolks and made a sacrifice to the Lord is showing that all of his Earthly doings were over he was completely sold out to the Lord that's the way every man and woman that comes to Christ to completely sell out to sin and everything behind him cross the separating line and look only to God what a difference it would be if men and women would do that do you believe in the testing and trying adios every son without any exceptions every Sunday I cometh to God must first be tried and child trained not only that but his working tools that he had he burnt them in the field to make a sacrifice to God to show that he had really sold out everything to be a prophet of the Lord is and what a lesson we could get out of that tonight that every man that come into Christ puts his hand on the plow and starts and even turns to look back is not worthy of the plowing this is today the reason we're having such times as we are is because there's too much halfway conversation intellectual conversations there is two different elements in the human body that has a mind and one of them is reasoning one of them the reasoning is of the mind which is intellectual the other one is just not reasonable believes the words that's a true Revelation is you should put everything else aside to leave everything to leave the schooling the jaramigos to leave friends to leave the party to leave your job but how can you leave it but how can you leave it all is putting everything else aside putting God first before your children your friends putting everything else aside offering a sacrifice to God Lucas is I'd like to read Luke 9 59 or Luke 9 52. is Padre and he said unto another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father Jesus Jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God and another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at my home at my house foreign maintain your eyesight or forward God bless you [Applause] guys amen we're talking about Elijah and Elisha verse 12. John 14 verses verse 12. verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the words that I do shall he do also in Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father it is verse 13 says and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the sun says if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it safat who's plowing with the 12 yolk of oxen before him and he with the 12th and Elisha passed him and casts his men to upon him so Elias so Elijah so saliendo de de La Cueva Elijah God speaks a um I can see as though they're passing the torch like they're passing a torch he was just a farmer you know boxing it was a change for Elijah and it says in the message God commissioning Moses Eliseo I can think of all the Elijah when Elijah had thrown his mantle on said he tells them to come and follow me and not only does he tell him he tells him follow him that's how it is Jesus Christ man amen the meaning of Elijah significa it means God is my salvation God is my health yours is well-being in my life yo Mama's personal to make it more personal is there comes to a point in our lives your time has come and follow me [Music] I literally left my job brother made you come to church tonight of the message of the hour the people that there are in the world Your Privilege amongst many amongst many and he said follow me and I followed him amen yeah this is speaking or hearing your second opportunity or perhaps it was going to be my last opportunity I thought about the future and how am I going to show them this is what example am I going to give them okay I was not I was no one something special in you foreign come follow me the title is in the message Elijah and Elisha preached in 54.ora but now we come into another age now the age of dying out all your worldly pleasures if you don't die no more they say I'll remember he says anything else can only die of death comes alive wow but I say it to myself we're not just any person the Lord says and with this I'd like to close and the message Witnesses Christian 53. Elisha took Elijah's place one day he started off and seen Elijah yeah and he threw his mantle and blessed sacrificial and he killed the oxen made a sacrifice showing that all the things of the world that's the only way I know how to say it is you have to burn that is you're the word of God is able to hear his voice that's a second chance tonight is to surrender to render your life to God the importance of the world don't need to be in our lives amongst the whole world something special and you have to die you have to die tonight foreign [Applause] [Applause] God bless you in this night I'm happy to be in the house of God again sometimes when you when you leave because God's presence is here amen amen I'm uh we're going to be speaking on Elijah Elijah Orlando De Eliseo we're transitioning from Elijah to Elijah and uh I'll be reading in Second Kings two boys and I'll be reading a couple verses get comfortable Second Kings 2 verse 1. and we also thank our pastor for the trustee grants us to use his Pulpit yes God for this opportunity and God's word reads and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal a contest and Elijah said unto Elijah uh Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as I so liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethelise verse 4 and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as I so liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho Elias is verse six and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as I so live I will not leave thee and they went went to they went on vesiculo says verse a and Elijah took his Mantra and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and dither so they too went over on dry ground verse 9 and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee led a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me is and verse 10 finally and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so verse now Elisha and Elijah or the Elias Eliseo two prophets those prophetas we got two prophets in this picture here and brother Branham says there the perfect type of Christ and the church he says Elijah is a type of Christo and Elisha the type of the church amen amen so just so this is uh I wanna I wanna speak to everybody I don't want to be too complicated so Elijah is a type of Christ all right an Elisha type of the church is that very easy to understand right but notice before Elijah leaves knowing that he has to leave he didn't leave Israel without a prophet or a witness he made a preparation to a man to take his place amen this is uh biblical it was and uh he left the people with a witness now if you remember when Jesus ascended he did the same typeismo a man he left as God God's witness and he made a preparation for a church like this and ordained that there would be Witnesses all the way through the church ages but what we just read here Jericho Jordan I just read it so you're not lost in the story well brother Branham says these are stages in the journey that the church has traveled through okay when the church came through the Dark Age went out of a Dark Age the first was Luther foreign Church followed by and so did the Methodist Church all right where he says but where my brother Josue left off his previous quote he says we come to another age now he says the age of dying out loud to all the worldly pleasures he says now when they got down to Jordan time to cross over maybe some of us are you know I I don't know what's happening but they're making me preach more often you know I feel like I'm still falling behind um because my pastor is way over there and I'm way back here am I the only one yeah I'm fine being the only one God works perfect with everyone well maybe this night is time to cross over he says then when he crossed over he said the stage of the Holy Ghost Church and now I want to ask you something so what do you want okay Elijah asking Elisha Elias maybe Jesus telling the church maybe God asking you now so what do I want what do you want remember you're the church and it says Elisha it is Jesus I hope somebody understood that yo is there's a scripture that says Greater Works ye shall do yeah so if Elijah is a type of Christ how much should the bride put forth if she's asking for a double portion Elijah did eight Miracles because he asked for a double portion now be careful what you asked foreign that was a hard thing well there's nothing impossible with God there's nothing hard with God continue saying yeah he said that a double portion of your spirit come upon me it's like if he was asking for more rain for more problems right sometimes when you ask God for something it gives you problems but those problems aren't to be discouraged those problems are to bring out what you ask God the devil just tricks but we have to know how God works us don't be scared as for the whole lot Jesus said you have not because you believe ask not you ask not because you believe not he said nothing is [Music] no pedis ask abundantly that your Joys may be full okay foreign [Music] glory to God Gloria Dios something about Elisha I'll go daily sale is that he was a one-eyed man Chester he only had one eye solament just one spiritual life is many times we're with our eyes were looking in different ways okay there was no Saga on that God would make us a man of one eye foreign because the thing of it is that if you saw him leave no no but but if if not then it wouldn't be so that's the catch and this is and that's why I read all those ten verses Elisha over and over I won't leave you I won't leave you I won't leave oh Brothers when my pastor tells me to preach again and again and again I won't leave you I won't leave you this flesh wants to it's here but the guard that is in me [Music] I would like to switch your view a little uh so Genesis 19. verse 25 Genesis 19 verse 25. this is the story of law exiting Sodom and Gomorrah is and verse 25 says and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground is for his wife look back from behind him and she became a pillar of Saul is all right at to some point that's why I've had the Revelation Revelation she was falling orders yes but she did not keep her eyes set forward and this was a consequence maybe it won't happen today but remember that natural is a type of the spiritual record I don't want to be looking at two different Revelations there's only one true one the rest are dogmas ideas but there's only one revelation of Jesus Christ and that is the one we're falling from our Elijah yes see so don't look back as our brothers are saying now I'm just repeating I'll be closing now the musicians don't look back where you came out amen amen don't look back and say I could have done better don't look back and say I regret it everything is for a lesson and it's all for you to trust God yes it's all for you for your life there's only life forward this is what brother Branham says notice when they got across he said now you've asked a hard thing but nevertheless if you see me go you'll have it um read that psalm 34. okay okay now he says here could you imagine a single-eyed man um that's the trouble with Christians tonight that's the problem with Isaac tonight he has his eye one of my eyes is on Christ and one of my eyes is in the world and that's the reason I'm not getting anywhere because I'm not looking straight maybe that's why we haven't gone to this church yet it's on its way but maybe we could have had it sooner they got their eye one of them on Christ and one in the world I can see Elisha watching him that's the only way he ever was going to get the blessing is when he catch watched him foreign I like to read Psalm 16. this is says I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved if you set your eyes always on God you will never be moved you will never be moved you know pray with your eyes set on God not on your difficulty that's the problem many times I'm praying thinking about the problems but I'm not praying how God will deliver me pray with your eyes set on God fear only God because the fear of God will always keep you from fearing anything else only fear God Brothers don't fear cancer don't fear anything Brothers fear only God the more you trust Jesus and keep your eyes focused on it the more life you will have must be the vowel open your life your spiritual life because I feel like I'm dying now every service for trusting God and you'll have more lives will bring you rest let's not play God anymore let's not play God anymore parado then I don't know what God you served again because God doesn't stop and my pastor doesn't stop that means the Sheep don't stop God bless you [Applause] [Music] why do you sing to him with all your hearts amen how many can say Jehovah Jireh [Music] and my
