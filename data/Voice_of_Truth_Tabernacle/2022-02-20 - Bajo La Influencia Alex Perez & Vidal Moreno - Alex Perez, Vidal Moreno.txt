on says and it reads entonces then the secret was rev then was the secret revealed to daniel in the night vision then daniel bless the god of heaven verse 20. daniel answered and said blessed be the name of the god for ever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changes the times and the seasons he removed with kings and set it up kings she gave it wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding verse 22 says he revealeth the deep and secret things he knows what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him lord i bless you to his word you may be seated do you guys have my notes back there will you guys get okay all right hallelujah bueno um let's get in quickly brethren um i'm gonna try to connect from my end is that okay okay no okay so is exclusively for the gentile people daniel uno as we've seen daniel chapter one miramos la migracion del pueblos babylonia we see the immigration of the people of israel to babylon and in chapter 2 we see a dream this king had esther este of the king pueblo say it again it was exclusively for the gentile people lucas capitolo versiclo painting cuatro nos dice 21 24 tells us and they shall fall by the edge of the soil and jerusalem shall be trodden down or stop or stepped on por los quentiles of the gentiles hasta que los tiempos de los gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled so the bible tells us and the theme men are believed that have chosen fluency or title for our preaching is under the influence [Music] my objective for this morning is to bring a teaching [Music] and then the dream we see there's a golden head especially we all read a little of daniel chapter two so i can let loose okay okay daniel represents daniel represents the golden head okay understood that the golden hair cuando [Music] clearly we spoke other deities okay babylonia okay babylon different had different gods so they worshipped deities another influenced babylonian was pleasures of the flesh in babylonia in babylon they were let sexual and moral immorality yes all of this was babylon and this was all they had influence another influence was believing you're greater than others i belong was a great country bro a great kingdom they were the main people they babylon's influence was pride homosexuality it was homosexuality and worship of man are you with me babylonia babylon has power despues pectoral and arms of silver este now this kingdom condos was made up of two different imperials different empires they were tribes of great military that means before joining they bring up a military potential and it's people that know how to fight now the persians they were very subtle and mighty empire they had the god name ara mazda el sabio which means the wise lord with a lot of wisdom joins these two empires and now that's what makes the persian meads now the immersion pete's influence is this uh it was also to worship different deities yes and it's alliances in this case they love to join alliances influence of the persian means babylonians you know i'm not as strong as a babylonian of powers the stomach and the thigh of bronzer represents the third empire we see it under the empire of greece alejandro magno alejandro el grande we see alexander the greats as he is known is he had an ambition and it was that he wanted to conquer the entire earth or world and you know in his time he almost did it he was the one one of the ones that conquered the most grounded land over more than anyone conquering empires to conquer empires that was the greek empire influencia de gracia what was greek's influence dominion dominion and power conquistad they say he conquered so much but he never conquered himself it's because this is a subject that has no end that's right that all the empires before rome we're getting mixed until they reached rome roma rome romero we're not under the babylonic empire anymore influenza but we have an influence you can say brother we're not in the time of the means and persians but the same spirit is here great to acquiring things is there brother the worse like to read what brother branham says in the message three witnesses be careful with these empires or kingdoms because the influence still continues see what brother branham says this is the kingdom of the devil something great says brother brandon if you want to run for politics [Music] by those but you don't understand so i'll explain it he says jesus jesus no he inherits them anyhow so there are the kingdoms of the world but i want to tell you then there's a kingdom of god belonging to this earth side of the lord jesus christ look we could go back to daniel and get the image look at the image the head of gold el reyno babilonico the babylonian kingdom brass or silver los medo persia means or persia alejandro magno so and notice in these ten kingdoms which exactly come in those ten horns that we were speaking of this morning roman you might say the babylonian empire doesn't exist the persian needs inclusion including rome no more pero roma but rome was infiltrated already had those doctrines and dogmas or indigenous people when they came to mexico they told them a story of lies because the spirits came already now bring it to your own life what is influencing me because these spirits are still here those that have gold or wanna look fair el imperio papa hermanos el that's why it's a cave of demons we have to be very careful alejandro magno many times we're like alexander the great right i say for myself i want to conquer everything obtain and obtain inside god bless you brother [Applause] god bless you yo if you just stand uh with me for a few moments i'll open up your bibles we're going to be reading from verse 5 and to verse 7. we're speaking on the message that we titled under the influence yes you know something had to bring us here there had to be a an influence you know that brought us to the house of god you know for many of you know for the youth you know maybe your parents brought you home maybe it wasn't your your will but it was your parents foreign but you know there was a there was an influence there no name fluency there's an influence that brings us you know uh to uh to to church you know i just you know we just pray that you know it's the influence of god amen amen uh psalm 75 verse 5 reads like this it says lift not up your horn on high speak not with the stiff neck for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south fork says but god is the judge it says he put it down one and set us up another one uh you may be seated and when we talk about influence influenza uh like i said uh just a little bit ago we've all been under some kind of influence influence we've been uh we've been some of us have know what it's like to be under the influence of alcohol influence others you know have been under the influence of drugs you know but but that that's that's not the only thing you can be influenced by influence you know because we see here you know as brother uh alex was reading about the um about um daniel yeah how the the king had an influence but you know although he had an influence we have to see him many times you see where the influence the don de la influence that we are influenced by the influence influence [Applause] you know how we just many times we get influenced so easily you know of the the the presidents and the governors of this nation you know they'll talk about about immigration you know you know the people that aren't from this country of a population of your popularity and so that he could win the people over because it appears like he's doing a good thing because they they went the people over that way we know that's not of god the bible tells us that this influence is not from god's that influence comes from the depths of hell it comes from the depths of hell and what it does is it brings the people into and captivity exactly why the people of israel were in babylon because of the sins that were committed because the sins that were done by their by their i believe there's people here this morning from that time it says this there was a maniac one day up in gadaria who was cutting himself and his power of ten times in order of an ordinary man could break the powers of them chains is when the devil takes a hold of a person insane it takes men and men to hold him breaks them chains i completely surrendered to the devil i believe that this man did not want to be in this condition i believe that he he did not want to be captive he was that although he was taking him to a place he was predestinated [Music] he says he breaks them chains completely surrendered to the devil completely how much more you may have done you don't want to be you should have seen me before i was a lot worse you know i was looking at a picture a while back you know the the times before i went to church you don't know i just looked at it and i believe that's how many of us were because it's almost valuable and many of us still may be like that yeah [Music] your right mind [Music] the king's heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of water eternity whatsoever you see your king the buccaneer and you know i just want to read real quick though and it says in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar dream dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled his dream to the kings it says oh king live forever it says tell thy servants a dream and we will show the interpretation the king answered and said to the chaldeans the thing is gone for me it says if you will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dung hill converted i wonder what kind of influence this king was under influence oh because you know he didn't get what he wanted he didn't get his way and he was ready to cut everybody to pieces i wonder if we're not ready to cut everybody to pieces get out of my way you can't give me what i want okay and we're ready to excommunicate the brothers you know and that's what this man was he was possessed he was ready to cut them all and i just want to go to um verse 10. yes and i want to read it says the chaldeans answered before that can show the king's matter and it is a rare thing that the king requires and there is none other that can show it before the king is except the gods salvolo whose dwelling is not with flesh no i believe that they were these chaldeans were right to a certain point notice in verse 10 being and you know there's not not only did they have their gods and where were their gods that could show them what let's balance don't have [Music] [Applause] and when they come in [Music] [Applause] and you just dive in there and you and then you know when you dive and you know there's pressure and you know those demands are turned in blue yes they're turning blue soon amen amen [Applause] and you know daniel that god-given influence influenza departed because yes the king did did uh make him ruler but it was only because of what god had done daniel they may call you this they may call you that but one day they're gonna call me they're gonna gonna be raptured they're gonna call me rapture one day the people that go you sick last person [Applause] we want to make sure

great of a man he was when he wasn't under that influence no he taught me so many things and and and you know i but it was just that influence you know that that became his destruction oh where he
