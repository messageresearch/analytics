hand [Music] [Applause] offering we have a great God we we have a great God Amen God bless everybody if you uh can open your Bibles with me first Timothy 1 Timothy chapter 4 verse 16 and I think uh I put all the all the verses and quotes on your [Music] notes no actually I didn't put any notes but I at least put all the verses there amen amen I hope everybody's doing well amen and it's good to see everybody amen it says like this take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that the let's pray Heavenly Father we just want to tell you that we love you tonight we love you Lord you are the love of Our Lives you are everything for us Lord and I know we don't show it a lot of the times we can do a lot better father but but help us hear something tonight that will help us be a little bit better Lord in serving you and loving you better serving you your people better we ask this in Jesus Christ name amen and amen amen amen amen God bless you may be uh we're talking about preparation um tell somebody next to you amen amen amen and I'm going to be talking about the third point that I made I I said this be ready to be a leader be ready to serve in anything be ready to do more than others if you want to be a leader of other you have to be willing to do more than others be ready to give yourself completely when you find your calling be willing to give up so that you can go [Music] up now uh uh we're going to talk about being a leader and and we're all all called to be leaders I'm going to say it again we're all called to be leaders every single one of us if you're a child of God if you're part of the Bride you were called to be a leader you were called to not only look after yourself but to look after others I don't want to get to heaven and and tell the lord well I made it Lord who cares about the rest if I get to heaven I want to take others with me I want to help others get there I want to do my best to leave a a footprints that other people can follow I want to know that I helped others make it as well we are all called to be leaders God told the people of Israel that if they would follow what he had established they follow his Commandments then they would be head and not a tail God wants us to be a head and not a tail and I like the way I like the way John Quincy Adams says this John Quincy Adam about the definition of a leader he said if your actions Inspire others to dream more learn more do more become more then you are a leader I'm going to say it again if your actions Inspire others now I love that he says actions because it's your actions which will inspire others if your actions Inspire others to dream more learn more do more become more then you are a leader now a leader doesn't start up in the front a a leader actually usually starts in the back if you're waiting to get to the front so that you can be a leader you have no idea what it means to be a leader a true leader doesn't need to be in in the [Music] spotlight so so that he can lead so that he can Inspire others or so that she can Inspire others they can Inspire others from wherever they are at like the song says shine in the light where you are the place where you are the light doesn't shine upon the leader the leader shines where he is there is light coming out of him where he is now now uh I like the way Timo uh Timothy the book of Timothy puts it take heed unto thyself and unto the the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee and the reason I like this is because it's telling us that you cannot give what you don't have if you don't if you don't become what you're trying to project then you won't have people to inspire it people follow not what you say they follow what you do they get inspired by what you do not by what you say so so uh Paul's telling Timothy take heed of Unto thyself and another words you have to go first you have to go first you can't expect to help others unless you help yourself first can can you repeat after me I need to lead myself before I can lead others now you can fake it but but you won't fake it for too long sooner or later people realize what you're made of and if you haven't learned how to take control of yourself lead yourself sooner or later people will realize that amen and they won't want to follow you now verse 12 of the same chapter uh uh says this let no man despise thy youth I want to stop there for a little bit uh the the first person that despises your youth many times is many times yourself you don't realize what you are capable of you think you're just a youth you feel like sometimes you feel like well I'm just I'm just a member of the church I can't do much I can just do this or I can't just do that you're limiting yourself but but I wish my desire as pastor of Voice of Truth Tabernacle is that from this church leaders would rise up we don't just want church members we don't just want church members I don't just want church members I would like leaders to rise up people who can go forth and help others people who can be an inspiration for others people who are willing to do more than just come to [Music] church just and just uh play an instrument you can do a lot more tell somebody you can do a lot more now do you believe that do you believe that church do you believe that you can do a lot more than what you're doing I don't care how much you think you're doing you can do more so the first person that the first person that despises your youth many times is yourself you got to realize no matter if you're 12 13 14 years old you can do a lot for God I'm going to say it again you can do a lot for God there are many examples in the Bible of so many youth that were able to do so much for God you don't need to you don't even need to be in your teens you don't need to be in your 20s you don't need to be in your 30s you can do so much for God if you're willing to pay the price and believe in yourself and believe in the gift that God has given you and believe that God called you for something I I'll say it again God called you for something God called you for something and you got to believe in yourself what are you waiting for youth what are you waiting for you waiting to get older to do something to give all for to be productive you're waiting to get older it's just going to get harder the older you get for you to accomplish anything you got to take advantage of the years that you have now right now it's such a great opportunity a lot of you don't have to pay rent or at least you don't you don't have to to pay all the bills a lot of you have a lot of time because you don't have to take care of kids or take your honey out or this or the other this is a great time to give yourself to God commit yourself to him consecrate yourself to him and say Lord what have you called me for this is the time that you go to God and you tell him God what is my calling for what did you call me for what was I made for my heart burns because I see so many youth wasting their youth they wasting it when you could be doing so much already for God I'm not talking to some other Church I'm not talking to some other youth I'm not talking to the ministers here I'm talking to you youth I'm speaking you you could be doing so much more for God where are the parents who are pushing their children to do more you think it's enough to just come to church you think it's enough for them just to sing a good song or to song lead or to interpret or to that's not enough they can be doing so much more for God many times we as parents don't believe in our youth we don't believe that they are called with a Divine Purpose we don't see those we don't searing them out our youth they need to hear the need to hear us tell them you were made for so much more son you were made for so much more daughter you could already be doing so much more for God they need to hear us they need to see us let no man despise thy youth but we do as parents we we we do as youth we do but be thou an example of the Believers so a true leader is an example to others you can't preach where you don't live you can't lead nobody when you don't you're not doing it yourself many people want to give orders they they like the power but the problem with that they never worked on themselves they never worked on themselves their character is way down here and they want to be up here in the position and sometimes they get up here sometimes they rise up but their character stay down here and let me tell you you won't stay up there for too long whatever you got you're going to lose it sooner later because your character never rose up to the level of the position that you're in and you're going to lose it there's people who become ministers who become pastors who become who become missionaries but their character never be came up to that level so their body was up there their title was up there but their character was never up there so they they're going to fall sooner or later they're going to fall sooner or later they're going to lose that because you got to work on yourself first you got to work on being an example and then he tells you be an example in word what do you say what do you speak you got to be an example what words come out of your mouth in conversation in in in in when it says conversation talking conduct how's your conduct how's your conduct around others you got to be the example Church Voice of Truth Tabernacle I I believe God called us not to be the tail God called us to be the example for others other people come to this church they they should see you that are the example for others do you believe that church do you believe that you can be the example says in conversation and charity in charity and love now being the example example means you you go first you do it first you don't wait for others to do it before you do you know no nobody remembers the person who does it second or third or fourth you always remember the person who did it first the person who helped you first the person who came to you first that's what being a leader means that you do it first you don't wait for others to do it you do it when others don't want to do it you do it when no one else everybody just looking at each other come on youth I've seen it a lot of times everybody just starts looking at each other this is not just for the Youth I hope this is for the ministers I hope this is for the people who serve in this church I hope this is for the parent for the mothers for everybody else everybody just looking at each other to see who's going to do it that shows that you're not a leader yet you got to be the example if you're a leader listen to me I'm talking to the whole church I'm talking to people who are in leadership right now too if you're a leader you have to be the example you don't put other people to do something you're not willing do you have to be the example amen glory to God glor Amen in conversation in charity in spirit and faith and Purity in all things uh he Titus 2:7 in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works like an example you're going to be the example that others will follow you're not going to wait for somebody else to do it you're not going to wait for somebody else to ask you to do it you're not going to wait for somebody to tell you to do it you're just going to do it because you know it has to be done because you know that somebody has to do it you have to be the that example now you got to be humble a true leader is humble he he doesn't go around parading before everybody no sounding the trumpet a true leader doesn't do it he doesn't do what he does so that other people will give him glory a true leader does it because he sees what he's called to do he knows that he's called to serve that's why Jesus says who whoever wants to be a great person among you a leader you have to become a servant you have to you have to humble yourself uh uh uh um James 4:10 says humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up it's God who lifts you up you don't have to lift yourself up Let God lift you up let God lift you up when you've done the work when you've you've submitted yourself to the Lord and you've humbled yourself and you've just done what needs to be done God will open the doors for you don't you don't have to be telling everybody what you've done I don't like it when people tell me everything they've done I don't like it I don't I don't I don't like people boasting about what they've done if you're going to do something just do it sooner or later we'll find out sooner or later God will show it sooner or later somebody will thank you for it you don't have to be telling everybody what you've done oh I help this person and I help this person oh and I gave this and I gave that that just shows you're looking for Glory you because you want the glory you want the attention that's not that's not a right motive if you go after that motive if that's what motivates you sooner or later you realize that the way of the Lord is not is not a way of Glory with God you don't go up by seeking glory god whoever humbles himself will be exalted is that right or is that right come on Church correct is correct if you really want to be a leader and you should you should want to be a leader you are called to be a leader you're called to do more for God then you got to be a servant 1 Corinthians 10:33 Paul says this even as I please all man men in all things not seeking my own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved now that's that's Paul Paul is say telling us this is the way I serve Paul was a great leader he was one of the best leaders the New Testament and he tells us how it should be done he said says this is the way you do it you try to seek others uh uh you try to seek others profits you try to make sure others are well because you're called to be a servant are you listening to me church can you say can you say after me I was to be a servant oh people people like being in position of leadership because they think they can order somebody else the leader is not the one that's supposed to be just ordering other people to do it they're the ones are supposed to be doing more than others if you're doing less than the others you're not being a leader oh I'm just going to tell you what to do go about the back door and we see you guys next time that's not true leadership people want to be in leadership because they want to tell other people what to do that's not the way to do it they want to give everybody else what they think that's not the way Paul did it Paul said I seek to serve others I seek to please others what's what what do do the majority want how can how can I be of the greatest uh H H uh benefit to the [Applause] majority not what I want but what what do the people need I'm here to serve them amen amen you can be hurting sometimes you can be sad sometimes but you don't pass that on to others you don't say well I'm just I'm just not feeling it today no you just you you seek what's best for everybody else if they need you to be strong you you need to be strong you're a servant I'll talk a little bit more about that in in a little bit Proverbs 2229 says sees thou a man diligent in his business he shall stand before Kings he shall not stand before mean men now a leader he seeks to be the best he can be he seeks to do everything the best possible a true leader he he doesn't just do a mediocre job he doesn't just say oh well uh that's okay no a true leader wants to do the best he can do when you're called to do something you want to do the best you want to give your best effort I don't like it I don't I don't I don't like it when song leaders come up here come here they haven't practiced they haven't they haven't spent time preparing themselves that just shows me they don't want to do their best if you want to do your best you're going to work at it you're going to sweat it out you're not going to rely on your talent you're say you're going to say I'm going to do the best I can going to work for what I what I have what God has given me me Lord amen you got to be diligent you got to put in your best work you got to say how can I get better how can I do this better Ecclesiastes 910 says whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah don't you like to see somebody who takes their job seriously don't you like to see somebody who says they're they're not playing around they're taking their job seriously they want to do the best they can they trying to figure out how to do it better whatever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy mind for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave where thou goest this is your chance this is your moment this is your time what are we doing with with what God has given us many times we just like to rest on our laurels just rest on our lur just kind of kick back relax say well I already got the talent I already got the gift I don't have to work at it too hard when you could be doing so much more when you can be inspiring others when you can be helping others when you can just be doing so much better you just dedicated yourself to it a lot more whatever whatsoever thy hand findeth to do what has God put in your hands come on youth come on Church what has God put in your hand what has God given you he got

getting better at it how are you helping others how are you giving your best to it am how are you breaking no new ground how are you going to New Frontiers this is our time this is our time can you repeat after me this is my time this is your time to shine this is your time to build up your character get better the only thing thing we take with us when we leave is our character what did we do with ourselves while we were here this is your time to polish yourselves your time to say I need to be better I need to work at it you know every day we have a devotion time with my son we' we've been having devotion time with our family our whole family and and and and I and I I've just been participating with them trying to learn new verses memorize certain verses of the Bible that that I already kind of know but I don't know them for sure and I just say Lord I can get better at this I can memorize some more verses I can memorize these things that I kind of just kind of left somewhere there I

read books on different topics so I can help you better I want to be a better person I want to be a better father father a better husband come on what's going on with us we relax so much and our life just passes Us by I was sharing with people the other day I since I was young care about my handwriting but recently God put it in my heart that I don't want to leave this earth with without having better penmanship without holding the pen correctly I used to hold it wrong and I didn't care I held it I don't know with like five fingers but God put it in my heart when I leave this earth I want to be able to write correctly those little things those little things that we don't care about we should be fixing them we should be saying I need to get better at this I don't want to this Earth with all those things in my life where I know I could have done better come on Church how are you going to leave this earth are you going to leave having done a mediocre job or are you going to leave having given your best at everything that you [Music] did I hope this is helping somebody I hope this is waking people the Bible says wake up you that sleep come on wake up church we don't have a lot of time we should give our best we should we should take advantage of the time that we have a leader tries to be the best he can a leader has to be honest he has to work on his character honest the definition of honesty it's free of Deceit and untruthfulness sincere the the angel of the Lord told Brother Bram when he called him for his ministry when that angel called him for his ministry he says he tell them if you would be sincere and you are able to get the people to believe you see that that's the biggest thing one of the biggest thing is your character you got to work on your character you got to work on being honest on being transparent with everybody it's okay to have mistakes but you got to be honest about your mistakes try to cover them you got to be honest you got to be sincere you got to you got to be you have to work on your integrity Matthew 5:37 says but let your communication be yayay ne ne for whatsoever is more than these come cometh evil people should be able to trust you if they can't trust you they're following you for the wrong reason if you want to inspire people they have to know that you're real they have to know it's okay for them to know that you're human it's okay for them to know that you're human I always remind people I'm human I get mad I get sad I make mistakes I sin as well you guys do I want you guys to know that but I want you guys to know that I'm trying to correct those things that I'm trying to get better that I'm trying to to live what I preach you got to be sincere your word your word has to mean something people have to be able to trust you if you say no then it's no it's yes then it's yes not be going flopping back and [Applause] forth you can't be a good leader if you're going back and forth all the time one day you're down one day you're up one day you kind of let let's do it let's do it Church let's do it there a bunch of hypocrit I don't want I don't think I feel up to it people are getting like man I don't I don't can't trust this guy you know many parents that's the reason their children don't follow [Music] them they tell them I'm I'm going to punish you they never punish them you think they're going to trust what they say it just takes one or two times for you to do that and then they don't believe you if you tell your children you're going to do something do it I'm sorry I'm just all right I'd rather not open my mouth people tell me brother can you do this I don't know I said let me think about it I don't want to commit to anything you guys know me right you guys know me because if I commit I have it on my conscience it matters to me if I tell my children something I got to do it because if I don't I want them to believe me I want them to know that when I say something they can trust and they know it's going to happen you guys are a little quiet today I hope it's because you guys are thinking about it you want your children to follow you you have to be a person of your word you have to follow what you say are you listening Church do what you say you're going to do if you say you're going to be her at seven be here at 7even if you say you're going to be here at 7even if you say you're going to be here on time be here on time if something got in the way then communicate it people need to be able to trust you are you listening church this not part of it this is all part of it Titus 2:7 says in Doctrine showing uncorrupt gravity sincerity you have to be serious about what you're doing you got to you got to understand this is whatever God called you to do you got to take it seriously you got to say this is my responsibility this is my job and I got to do it right and I'm going to take it seriously I'm not going to be playing around with it a true leader learns from others listens to others Hebrews 13:7 says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation yes you can always learn from others you should always be learning from others you should always be growing you should always be asking people who don't ask is because they don't want to learn they think they already know it all they think I I don't understand how you can think you know it all why we have to ask questions we have have to try to learn always growing always going to the next step a leader needs to be consistent the word consistent means acting or done in the same way over time especially so as to be fair or accurate I like that you got to be consistent we got to be consistent church we got to we got to just just do it when we feel it when we don't feel it season and out of season don't let your feelings guide you you know what your responsibility is you know your responsibility as a church member yes or yes you know what you're supposed to be doing you know your responsibility if you if if you have a charge in church if you have a gift if you have a calling you have to say I got to be consistent that's another reason kids don't trust their their parents they're never consistent they don't know when when they're just gonna off you got to be consistent uh Joshua 18 says we know this verse this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success Psalms 1: says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsil of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his the light is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night you got to be consistent day and night day and night that means every day that means every day every day you give yourself to the Lord every day you give yourself to your calling every day you do something get better every day you do what you're supposed to do come on church every day every paycheck every time every service you are there you are present you're available you do what you're supposed to do am that's when you prosper [Music] every day you know what you're supposed to do 1 Corinthians 15:58 says therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord constantes constant constantes constant that means always always always available always ready always always trying to do your best and I'll talk about the last thing which is if you're going to be a leader you got to know how to take the punches the more power you receive the more um in front you are you're going to become the target you're going to become a bigger Target every time you do more every time you take a position of leadership every time you want to do something you're going to encounter more problems that's why in in the corporate world they pay the people that are uh that are higher they pay the more because they're going to deal with more problems and you got to learn how to take it brother bam says in the message why Christ speak I believe that he called me for this purpose doesn't make me any more than the that man that got saved this morning just your servant your brother makes me less than you because I'm sent to serve you I am a servant to the public a public servant is a minister to serve the public to be the underdog to take this to take this KN of yes they're going to complain about you they're going to criticize you they're going to call you names they're going to try to knock you down he says whatever
