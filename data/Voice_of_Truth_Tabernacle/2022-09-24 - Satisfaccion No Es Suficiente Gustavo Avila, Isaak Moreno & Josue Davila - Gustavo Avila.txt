I'd like to thank my beloved Pastor yeah giving me the trust to preach to his his congregations alongside with these Great Men of God is and the word of God says like this is now Joshua was old and striking in years and the Lord said unto him our old and striking in years and there remains yet very much land to people's death [Music] amen let us go to our Lord in prayer so you can bless us in this evening gracious and bountiful father uh um Lord what more can we say but thank you Lord we don't deserve to be here Lord we don't deserve to have this church we don't deserve to have a great Pastor um we don't deserve everything that we have in our lives our life itself but yet bike race a gift undeserving if we can simply have that in our minds and bring it down into our hearts then Lord I believe that you can bless us because only in the right mentality Lord and in the right Spirits is when your Holy Spirit can come down dig deep within our hearts unveil our deepest Secret foreign satisfaction isn't enough I want you to listen to that one more time satisfaction isn't enough because I believe in a sense of way satisfaction does not exist in God's vocabulary satisfaction means satisfaction significa pleased or content is with what has been experienced or received I'm gonna say it again please what has been experienced or received starting the story of did a beautiful job last week but the story of rake and the Battle of Jericho and as you continue on with the story of Joshua we know that that was not the only battle he had he went through all have greater battles after he faced Jericho after that you can see that Joshua at times would face five kingdoms this was at one time in some occasions he even fought 15 to 20 Kingdoms at a time and one could say wow that's something very tremendous something that you can maybe show off and say you know this is what I did but many times we put God's plan which is foreign [Applause] it's never gonna be enough for my God cause my God is always looking for more because he know there's more there's more things than there's things of the world you may be satisfied with coming to church every Friday every Sunday every Wednesday but our Prophet Taurus is not only that Federal Way it's not just being satisfied with hearing a beautiful preachings it's not enough to hear quotes being read but it's up to us desire higher things desire to be used by God even more because if the devil Diablo he'll get us in the mentality [Applause] it says but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the curse things I see and the tribe of Judah took of the current things and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel tomorrow now here Aiken after the Battle of Jericho God has commanded and told Joshua to tell the people of Israel [Music] [Music] this is a gun when he took that little wedge and that babylonic garments he presumed it never be seen well what's that it's just an old little old garments I'm just gonna take five ten minutes on my social media [Music] oh I had a great service on Friday Saturday's coming I'm gonna watch a movie at night I'm gonna take some time for myself I'm just say it again satisfactions because God knows what we're capable of love and then I'm gonna tell you this the devil knows what work he knows that he can stop us he can stop us from receiving the true promise a True Deliverance haven't you found yourself you feel good for a Time hey you're doing right with the Lord yourself slipping away and it's not a big change from one day to another it's the small little things you do you start pushing yourself away from God stop fellowship with him as much or convincing yourself I've done enough there was so much still to conquer oh much [Applause] ahead of us who we have the next service tomorrow that's what I'm trying to get at it enough is enough [Music] to have a mediocre Christian Life we were never called to have a mediocre Christian alive but that's only one portion of the promised land calls to just possess we were not just only called one portion of Our Lives God gave us the gift of the Holy Spirit get on the ground all the ground that we've given the devil lately [Music] we're giving them our time we give them our minds and many times we've given them our hearts but we can come to realize we could come to realize that everything that we have by far by far is by the grace of God is Not By Your Works fortify the pleasing your grace of God and I believe that's what that's the mentality of an overcomer because this is the land of the Overcomers it's battle after battle but yet like Joshua knowing his possession knowing what he was called foreign I don't have it it says this is what God wants for his church God wants a church with Revelations so we can know the devil's tactics and now to overcome them because the devil knows now listen to this he knows he can't fight against us when you are your full capacity and then he says and the only way that he can beat us is when we start to drop our guards how do you know you're starving you you started drops like your guard foreign [Applause] Victoria that's the only way we can't do it our own they're still over here where I've tried to do it on my own if I could say it a self-righteousness [Applause] I try to sanctify myself but I can't clean myself can I pour myself I can't pour myself it's a personal Affair what you have with God but tonight we can have that one thing in our mind the satisfaction isn't enough yes is that is then I think I can do something with us tonight [Applause] foreign God bless you brothers and sisters I'm very happy to be here tonight amen the Lord is good amen ameno hey man let's read that verse again Joshua 13 1 verse and says now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him Thou Art old and strict engineers and they remaineth yet very much land to be possessed as you know our title it's um sorry Brothers I'm a little nervous hold on status saddest being satisfied isn't enough sorry and as a subtitles I put the devil's greatest gratified satisfaction and gratified um the definition that I found for gratified it says to be a source of or give pleasure or satisfication to the star satisfaction contento satisfaction contento or give pleasure and as we see here um we see Joshua or God told Joshua Josue that there still remaineth much land to possess and a lot of the times we let the devil Diablo we let them think we let him tell us that we should be satisfied with what we have all right we let him lie to us we try we let we end up gratifying the devil we end up pleasing him please in him the way we walk the way we talk the way we live the way we dress and we're just gratisfying we're gratifying the devil is you know I heard something today and a preaching and I said um brother Burley Williams said it he Emmanuel Williams Bernie William Nico uh maybe a lot of the youth know him he said the devil would try to follow you he said uh the devil tried to defile you and to defile it means to corrupt the Purity or Perfection of it and if he can to follow you then he will blend in with you because the devil knows how to act as a Christian as well you see brothers and sisters if the devil can't defile you can't corrupt you you can't take your Purity away you'll start blending in with you'll start coming to church with you we all know the devil's the first one here so he'll be here before you'll be seated next to you it doesn't know a lot of those things who even raised his hands before you raise your hand foreign you're not truly having an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ they're here by force you're here because your parents come Saturday you're here because what will the brother say if I don't go you're raising your hands just to raise them and I say that because I've done that before sometimes the preacher will be going on and sometimes you get caught off guard and just raise your hand for no reason and you're like why did I raise my hand and we honestly don't even know why we raised our hands but um and he kept saying that as he's going on through the preaching this is barely talking still as well he says you see the devil wants you dead but he'd rather have a bachelor in Christianity if we see Samson you see they didn't kill him they had him as a sport they rather laugh at a Christian and not be able to laugh at you at all you see the devil would rather have you backsliding little by little be making fun of you have you in his hands amen amen you see uh my dad shared this um verse with me in the back you see we have to be transformed Brothers we read in Romans 12 2 it says and be not confirmed to conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds and acceptable and perfect will of God you see Brothers foreign is transformed by the renewing of your mind we need a renew it and I just want to read um I want to read this quote by our brother Branham God commissioning Moses reaching 53. it says you got to get determined determinado that's right get ready take over God said so let's go take over that's what God wanted us to do that's what God wants us to do tonight God's always willing to give us if we're ready to receive it that's right guys so it's ours the promise is unto you yeah to your children to them that fought to them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so the promise is here see Brothers um a lot of the times muchas versus and also this is something that my dad shared with us in the back as well and it really touched me um because he said lot of the times muchas versus we like to just be called Christians cristianos you're satisfied with being called a Christian is actually living the Christian Life uh we're like oh we're called the Christians so we're Christians when reality Brothers we're not really living that Christian lives and I keep saying Joshua and Caleb when they went over I like that they thought I like that they thought there when they came over the ten come the ten come back and said oh we look like grasshoppers up the side of them and Joshua and Caleb said we can do it that's right God promised we could do it God said we could do it God promised our fathers that we was going that was our land and that belongs to us no matter if they get all cities because we haven't fully received the promise amen amen and it keeps saying all things are subject to Jesus Christ and all things are subject to you in prayer when you ask in his name and believe see Brothers we have the answer right there we have the answer you see it's when we believe we ask God In Prayer we have the promise we will see what we asked we can't even pray and I say it because of me sometimes we can't even pray for five minutes because we're falling asleep you know just a quick um I guess little I'm a experience yeah so you know uh when I found out I was preaching I found out by my brother um Gus right here Gustavo he um he called me and miyamo and he said he said hey bro what you got for Friday oh yeah and I was confused I was like what do you mean what are we doing Friday and he's like yeah you're preaching with me like bro I didn't even know so I didn't have nothing I was like bro I'm gonna have to call you back and I told I remember telling myself start praying and you know I'm a stream because because I told myself but I still waited till the last minute you know I I got everything practically today of what I was gonna talk about [Music] we're all here then I don't think anyone here has you at gunpoint for you to be here so you know we just have to give him the praise we have to give him the glory Gloria we have to pray to him we have to believe he's gonna do something for us but we can't have those things by just sitting here come in a church Wednesday Friday Sunday hearing the word here I'm going back home I'm not doing nothing we have to keep doing more you can't be satisfied with people speaking the word to us we can't be satisfied with our pastors we have to feed ourselves it's an everyday battle because what are you doing Monday Tuesday and Thursday yeah I know a lot of the time Saturday you know everyone's happy for the weekend days ago you know go party or go chill or yeah you know the brother Brandon says we should be getting the red ready the night before and that's something I really yes really value of my father mucho he's always making sure we're ready for Sunday special Sunday but let's keep reading and it says ask what you will ask what you will in my name and it will be done that's right whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you will receive it you shall have it God said so so let nothing stand in your way stop looking at the things you're looking at here and look at the Unseen God said we could do it a lot of times we're just looking at things in front of us we're just looking at our sickness and we're satisfied with that a lot of times we're like oh God gave me this six times but why don't we overcome tonight Brothers why don't we pray to God you overcome tonight so tell them to help us tonight the takeaway well our sicknesses what are diseases he said Gather the Israelites up and down the this River here you're going to see the glory of God yes sir how are you going to get across the river that's not my business it's my business business to walk down to the river it's God's business to open it up when I get there that's right it's your business to testify and claim your healing see he says and it's God's business after you testify and Proclaim it he is correct God give you God give you a dare to try it [Music] so now just take it tonight and find out whether it's right or not and you see Brothers see it's not our business what happens after we pray to God after what we asked after that it's up to God what we want from him let's stop and let's be transformed brothers and have a renewing of our mind foreign verse 3. it is saying it says like this is and they returned to Joshua Joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite I.E and and make not all the people to labor thither but for they are but few it is so there went upstairs of the people about 3 000 men and they fled before the men of AI God bless his word amen so [Music] and the Bible says um foreign and the people of Israel were defeated and further I had the Bible it says and fell to the Earth upon his face before the Ark of the of the Lord until the evening Israel he and the Elders of Israel and put dust upon their heads and Joshua said foreign but to God we had been content and dwelt on the other side of Jordan was shared and all the goods that he had if I would just put this into our time you're just a satisfied we are satisfied with so little I went to the altar yes the service was for me it was very very impressive we become containers you want more of God the hundred leaves us for you Lord it comes and goes a month ago and I had forgotten one word Mano I was speaking with the brother not that long ago that the word of God the message for him it was an addiction really what brother Branham tells us and I remembered it I I said that's the truth is sometimes two things we should not be addicted in social media we're so wrapped up in social social media Sports we're not addicted to his word is through my brother okay that we have to be addicted to the word of God and not be satisfied with so little the word of God says that Jesus Jesus in the Canaanite woman the Canaanite woman she went to Jesus he did not even even pay attention to it and then in the word of God it says Jesus and then he answered that's what that's what Jesus said I was not sent but to the lost sheep of Israel that's right and he said on her face and she said uh Lord uh help me yes and he answered and said it's not good to give the loss of the children and and give to give and she said yes Lord but even the dogs eat of the crumbs from from the table of their owners and then Jesus answered a woman to you according to us at what you desire and her daughter was healed at that hour it's not fair that faith and perseverance that person didn't I can't give it to the dogs eat of the crumbs did we not have a dedication otras denominaciones that's the other denominations so okay you know what is even though are more dedicated and they don't have the truth he has this message
