Acts 3 verse 19. ie repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord we'll be speaking with our title times of refreshing yeah go ahead and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you again whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began foreign foreign this is the Lord Jesus Christ now we're speaking that she is a broken bride but we're also speaking that God repeat God has the medicine speaking of the times of restitution of all things it's speaking about the second coming of the Lord how many are waiting foreign for her from any type of illness foreign so you brethren I believe that the word refreshing here is more than just food what the word means here is that he will send time of Aid or help times of Hell how many of us need help is out of the Lord Jesus Christ amen is looking for a place to rest foreign do not benefit them why foreign to relax [Music] yeah worry that nervousness now look at this is Revelation 3 17 says I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing no it's not Thou Art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked yes la is that the age of vladesia Refugio they find their own refuge in quentinence they find their own help in Las Casas Este Mundo and the things of this world that's the difference between the the bride and the foolish or the Church of this age because the bride no pueden contrary cannot find that help in religion in religion in Iglesias in churches only come to church so often what they want is foreign the signaling angel estaba buscando a personas was looking for people that were groaning we were in the denomination and we were grown in porque located [Music] a living life that's right amen the Bible says that the children of God are groaning in themselves God didn't call you just to be a Christian in a church God didn't call you yes but God called you familiar your family daughters is groaning this is children of God Amen and that's why the bridegroom Lord Jesus Christ needs to be healed located if for God wanted was to correct his bride I'm not saying it doesn't go with this but let me I want you to understand that first it's a refuge this message is a refuge many of us take it as a rock if you're not in the message I haven't understood what this message and the message he's speaking of a series of Refuge foreign [Applause] wow his enemy had the privilege and right to drag him from that Altar and kill him next paragraph says foreign [Music] water Brooks she doesn't want to do it that's why I believe this message shouldn't be taken as some for something to correct there's a balance in all this I don't want you to be unbalanced but I believe that first as a refreshing yeah she doesn't want to do it something in here I don't want to do this is what God's word says she's in love with him [Applause] [Applause] amen right oh brethren is this message is a refuge I don't believe the bride needs so much I believe she needs a refuge because she corrects herself she should stop doing it says you can do it by her own strengths God provides a place a message of Grace that makes the difference from all the restaurants those places are a refuge but let me tell you this here is where it's heard a place of Refuge must have two things must have help for whoever is your protection from the enemy but must also be strong has to be strengthened for the Enemy No pueda so not be able to The Refuge take that person out of denominations they offer help they don't have enough strength Paramount Christian in the things of God that's why Spirits returns that's why they're spirits of religious what happens to those places so hold that person there but my God he's a refugee yes and David speaking to the Lord the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies My Savior thou saves me from violence because you can have a refuge yes and that's what that's all people have found only a refuge that's all they find in drugs just a refuge something temporary comes with his clothes [Music] this place where the Waters of the Holy Ghost descended and he says but they would uh leave again they couldn't hold it now that's what happens with us the Holy Ghost comes in but just as it came in we have a baptism yes stay there your Refuge [Music] so hold it there you need a fortress in that reference a fortress forgive me a refuge without a fortress is of no benefit are you understanding is of no benefits use your enemy will come in the Fortress [Music] but if the Refuge is missing a fortress easily they'll take you out yes and that's what has happened they are a lot they are refuges but they don't have a fortress that is what has happened the Holy Spirit comes we open our heart to God we give a place in our hearts of the Lord but there's not a fortress and Life come out if the bride can stay long enough Under the Sun to germanize that seed of life but we are unable to foreign for When government promised to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself sincerely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply themes and so after he patiently endured he obtained the promise foreign by the greater and on oath for confirmation is to them and end of our Strife this is God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the Prime Minister amen immutable immutability of his Council confirmed it by an oath this is immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entries into that within the veil now one Lugar a place of refugees I believe is this message I believe this is the help God's children needed is the voice of Elijah for our time Lord Jesus Christ not only just to heal the world but it has enough power to Anchor the Believers anchor the Son of God and to protect from the enemy they lost the spirit from the Shadows because there's no benefits still attacking us but this message is a real Refuge look our problem is that many times we stay on the edge we stay at the Gate of The Refuge protection but for you to really be protected you must come in I'll just come in but come in although the deeper that you go in the more hidden that you are the more you go in the word and the message [Music] but we like to play we want the medicine you don't want to answer completely we want the medicine but then we want to go out out again SOS that is foreign foreign the first thing he had to come upon his own free will see brother it's not to force the people if the people okay foreign [Music] [Music] No One's Gonna force you look brother what happens when we aren't forced sometimes there's not an urgency or when we feel a little bit of Refuge it's okay we begin to think about everything that's behind us and we stop going in elementary is a rapture he reads the scripture for that message and in Psalms 27. it was Psalm 27 says this is too important Brethren it's important this is important for the bride might be not important for someone else but it's important the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fearless the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell down though a host shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall not fear the world shall rise against me and this will I be confident it's all in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in this Temple Brothers are his wonders we are satisfied with plain church but God says that's not what I want with us truly know who I am um [Music] You Don't See either way out yeah that's that that's bulldoze yourself when you come down oh Brothers [Music] God's healing foreign like this is a completely where you're completely sold to him where plane was the medicine we're playing with it David is saying you will be my Refugee when I decide that this is my house to dwell forever decisions can come he says he says you need to be planted by the by the currents of water this is that gives its fruit at its time she says this is the fruit of the Lord everything she needs to produce [Music] I'm not sure if you're found amongst them that are groaning because they know that they're missing something please stand I'm not sure if you're found with them that are hurting [Music] why am I still trying [Music] so find a refresher elsewhere when you're all I need but you must come in so the point where the devil can't find You is So invested of God's power and love you are so clothed with him that the devil cannot find us you are in his Refuge foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you must anchor yourself on something steadfast it's a word that's revealed for this hour that's what can give you everything you need is what that can make that whole thing create a new life and new or else I will die there's no help anywhere else is there anyone bleeding here is there anyone so in need of God if you don't help me it's time to come in the waters it's time to sink in him [Music] let me wash all evil away from the enemy out of you oh Lord help me help your bride promise to send a refreshing time thank you if you are happy
