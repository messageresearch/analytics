[Music] marriage supper of the lamb is coming and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkles listen to this is very important for me and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready all right we think we must come to recognize to it is the darkest scene jesus is the most difficult is the most deceiving but in this church more revelations god gave her the materials so she could have access but she half made herself ready now this is important i know we've heard it before is if the lord will take this evil spirit from me the tomat from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him [Music] i will serve you i've said that so many times today i was reading we keep making excuses many times that's why we keep being what we keep that's why the devil keeps beating that's why he keeps beating us keeps if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking gambling lying stealing i'll serve him but that's up to you repeat that's up to you hello but when we read this it feels like it's not real it feels like it's impossible [Music] according to everyone uh that's right you will receive and he offered offering 10 cents i'm sure he gave a dollar i'm not sure and he was complaining oh i didn't like that services [Music] [Music] here it's by what we've invested in them there's something you have to do too says brother branham you have the power to do it [Music] you must be willing to surrender it i use that here's the problem we're not willing to surrender it is if we're willing we're willing for a couple minutes maybe a couple hours maybe a day or two yeah but we want to take it up again yes or yes brethren they continue saying she hath made herself i like that word and then say see what an overcomer he is brother branham says thank you what does it say middle of the paragraph you have nothing to overcome you through and let it go nuestro an application i wrote this on the app in the motivation group how the word joy grega j-o-y significa jesus primero means jesus first place others after joe altima and me and the end es that's the way to have joy yes you is made up of what you think your identity is who i think i am it says it's my ego okay there's people that feel that they're the smartest that they know more than everyone else the way that you see yourself that is your ego okay all right we all have a story of how we see ourselves now there are things things we use to identify or create this ego mucha gente there's many people us use their body to let themselves know who they are so they see themselves in the mirror you know yeah they see that they are good looking that they look clothing or why does someone buy brand instead of buying something similar it's the same thing it's the same amount of money it's not doing more than the others but they buy a product a brand name because that makes them feel there's something historia part of their own story materials these there's people that use their culture there's something [Music] i'm that makes me someone else this makes me someone great [Laughter] that's why tawa's always trying to be with me amigos friends suscriencias their beliefs their story where they come from what they've done their experiences because i'm full of experiences over and over because i did i already went through that your age your job how much money you have in your bank account this is all part of your story that's part of the story that you tell yourself this makes me someone i want to tell you because that it's all lies [Music] those things don't give us oh with being something normal normally it equals or substitutes having something with being something but you can have everything and not be anyone these things anymore [Music] it's always comparing always compares to everyone the son of god shouldn't have to compromise the purpose that no one else no one else is that it will never be satisfied i have it but the problem is it doesn't matter doesn't you can be the president of the united states but it will always want more elego more more fame more things recognition depending on the value that others have that's why it's always wanting approval from others it's always the more that people praise you the more people see you as a great person mass is the more that it is and the problem is that it's not true jesus christ jesus christ even his own disciples left him in the end he would be crucified if you are dependent if your value is depending we're not as good as the resilies i'm not as good as you think i am sir also not as bad as you think i am that i can be we're bound to these things that's why we don't let them go so i want to be wanted because that makes me feel like i'm someone or something and at the end it's all a lie that we've made up important at the end it won't matter who wants me [Music] the musicians can come you need to be willing to lay down your ego your eyes what gives value to your life what makes you feel like someone or something how can i overcome there's a reward for overcomers and then he speaks to all the lilies press on lily if it's in you ha ha lay aside the mud and everything else and press towards the top [Music] the problem is our ego [Music] that's why god can't help us [Music] no it doesn't [Music] in the end it won't matter [Music] lord [Music] we need to unpack [Music] gives us [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] beautiful things [Music] yes [Music] and he can take control from there [Music] is [Music] i want what you want in my life [Applause] lord [Music] is [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music]
