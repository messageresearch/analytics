TRANSCRIPT
========================================
But he couldn't get the inspiration on him and he was wearing him. And that when you get in that kind of fix that's when the enemy moves into friend near to you to accusing oh it must have been a miserable thing for him and all his friends that accused him. Satan then goes and jns himself with the enemy. That's when Satan comes in. Let me have him and I'll make him curse you. I'll make him deny message. I'll make him curse you. I'll make him go back and say it was all wrong. Then he tried him with everything he think to all the great man and friends that he used to have. But Job stood flatfoted for he knew he had heard tomorrow night. I heard of God that said something and it's going to happen that way. Just the same as these other things happen to happen now. J and now Job had something wrong with him but he couldn't get the inspiration on him and he was wearing him. And that when you get in that kind of fix that's when the enemy moves into friend near you got they accusing oh it must have been a miserable thing for him his friends that accus him satan then goes and jns himself with the enemy that's when Satan comes in let me have him and I'll make him curse I'll make him deny message. I'll make him curse you. I'll make him go back and say it was all wrong. Then he tried him with everything he could to all the great man and friends that he used to have. But Job stood flatfoted for he knew he had heard I get that wings I heard the voice of God that said something and it's going to happen that way the same as these other things happen. going to happen. Now, Job knew it was going to happen and he know that God had told him that that he was just, but they made him a sinner. So, he waited then for the inspiration. Satan getting all the the people come around his comforters so and accused him, but it didn't move him a bit. But when the word of God became vindicated to him, he had heard of God by the hearing of the ear, but one day setting out at his lowest point. And while he was sitting there and everyone accused him, even his wife tell him he was wrong, he scraping his boils. And Elahu came down and rebuked him for being selfish about the way he was accusing God and so forth. And then at that time it was when inspiration struck him. That's when the light begin to flesh, the thunders begin to roar. That's when the inspiration struck the prophet and he raised up and he said, "No, my redeemer liveth, and at the last days you'll stand up on this earth. No, the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God. I shall see for myself. been talking about the trees, the boty life. Hi, dies and lives again. Water brings it back again. Smell of water, the scent of water, the results of water pouring up on a tree or something or seed that went to the ground. He said, "But a man lay it down to give it up the ghost his children come to him. He perceive it not. Or thou hide me in the grave." Job 14, th be if a man, shall he live again? all the pointed times of my life. I'll wait till my change comes. Thou will call me and I'll answer. Thought me balance and I cannot pass. So forth. He know all these things. He watched a tree live. But what happened to a man when he died? He didn't raise up again. So God was show him this redeemer. He wanted to see if there was somebody who could interceed for him. He had interceeded for so many people. But now is there somebody can speak for him? Could there somebody put his hand on Job or on a sinful man and a holy God and make bridges away? Could he go to his house and knock at the door? Would he open the door and talk to him a while? But then when the inspiration dropped into his heart, then he could see God. The lightnings are flashing, the thunders are roaring. And when it did, he stood up on his feet and he said, "I know my redeemer, live. My redeemer in the last days stand on the see he had to see God's reaction to his faith. Now we wonder if we could see God is there a way that we could see him now it was the only way God had tried job out. He said I have heard of thee with the hearing of the ear but now I see thee. But now I see thee with my eyes. The vision of the made he seen rolling around the flashing of the lightning or saw it and seen the rolling of the thunder maybe on a clear day and he seen God was in that cloud and that lightning he could see God with his natural. See, because the invisible was made visible, the visible vision of others was then vindicated clear to the natural eye. Just like faith with works as we spoke on last night. Abraham had no Bible to read either, but he was a prophet. his vision and his faith and it seem wrong to others that he should think that way that he should think going to have a baby but they did have the baby because his vision of the baby was what he was talking about. I'm going to have it. I'm going to have it. But when the baby was born, then the other people could see with the eye what he saw in a vision. And when you go to acting upon what you believe in your heart, then the people know God and know what's happening to you, but the way you act, that's how you see God with the eye. But to him, all he had done that was good, all that he had done for others, he needed somebody to interceed for him. When the birth of the baby come, Isaac, the um the inspiration that had led him to this had vindicated his vision to where the people could see that what he had in a vision was actually the truth. Now, sometimes these great pulsations of faith come right in the time of crisis. It's usually crisis that drives us into this. It was a crisis that drove Job into it. Why is the end of his life? His children was dead. his camels and all his goods was gone and destroyed and his own life broke out from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet with boils. It was a crisis that he pressed his inspiration strucking. men and women tonight. If you could look around and see how close we are to the coming of the Lord, you who cut off the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you may be relied upon some sensation or something that you done that Satan can impersonate and can't have the real spirit in you to go all the way in God's promises. How can a man that claims to have the Holy Ghost deny one word of this Bible being not right? You can't do it no matter how religious you are. How many churches you belong to, how many books your names on. If that genuine Holy Ghost is in you, which is this word manifested, you see the message of the hour because it's a Holy Ghost that does. But there has to be something light that off. Inspiration strike you. And if there's if you pour water on the ground, on the ground on the ground and there's no seed in there to strike it, how can it ever bring forth anything? There's nothing to bring for. That is that only the elected of God will see it. The elected of God Noah's time, Moses time, Jesus time, the apostles time, Luther's time, West time, Pentecostal time. Because that was a seed that was on the earth when this inspiration was poured out. Now, while the inspiration poured out together the bride together, it's only those who are elected will see it. Jesus said, "I thank the Father that thou hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it to babe. Such is blurn." Now inspiration has to strike it. Now when the inspiration struck him that did it. He had it then. Now we find out it comes time of these crisis when the press is right on. And you look around today, look at the condition we're living in. Aren't we living in a modern Sodom Gamara? Hasn't the world come back? That was a gentile world that was destroyed then by fire. Didn't Jesus say in St. Luke the 17th chapter the 28 29th and 30th verse that as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man when the Son of Man is being revealed. What is a revealed? Is a secret made known. A revelation is to reveal or make a secret. Now these things been hit all through the church ages is now being revealed made one. Now we can say that and if God didn't back that up that's wrong. See, God don't need anybody to interpret his word. He's his own interpreter. He said a virgin shall conceive. And she did. He said let there be light. And there was and we are not living in Luther's age, Wesley age or the Pentecostal age. The pentecostal age is only a restoration of the gifts coming back to the church. But we're living in the evening time. We're living in the time of the calling out of the bride. Just as it was hard for the Catholics to see Luther and the Luthers to see the West and the Pentecost west to see the Pentecostal age. So is it hard for the Pentecostals to see this age? It's always been that way because it's poured out upon an elected seedah and not only what the Bible teaches. Job. Dios los bendiga. Se podría poner de pie conmigo en esta tarde. ¿Quién vino listo a tener iglesia? ¿Quién miro a tener a servir al Señor? Necesitamos un avivamiento. Holy Ghost God when the Holy Ghost comes out to baptize everyone and there's no other place I' rather be.

And struggle for darle un aplauso al Señor Jesucristo. ¿Cuántos están emocionados? ¿Cuántos están con expectativa esta noche? Verdaderamente es un privilegio dar la bienvenida en el nombre del Señor Jesucristo en este servicio de apertura de esta semana de servicios que vamos a estar teniendo. Creo que cuando nuestro pastor nos dijo el tema de esos servicios, yo creo que fue Dios que se lo dio a él. Amén. Y con eso les recuerdo que el tema de estos servicios será el Dios de lo imposible. Amén. Yo creo que el Dios de lo imposible ha sido visto en muchas vidas aquí. en estos ayunos. Amén. Pero también le quiero hablar a aquellos que tal vez a lo mejor el Dios de lo imposible todavía no se le ha revelado a las vidas de ellos, pero les traigo palabras de esperanza. Él lo hará. Él lo hará. Y con eso, igualmente les doy el título de esta noche, fe perfectamente posicionada porque no nos hace nada bien de conocer o saber de un Dios de lo imposible. Si no tenemos fe en ese Dios de lo imposible. Y con eso si me pueden seguir al libro de Lucas, capítulo 1, Lucas capítulo 1, versículo 34. Le damos la bienvenida a cada uno mirando a través del internet. Los amamos a cada uno y gracias por estar con nosotros. Estamos todos con expectativa, estamos todos emocionados. Yo estoy emocionado de lo que va a suceder en estos servicios. Versículo 34. Entonces María dijo al ángel, "¿Cómo será esto?" Pues no conozco varón. Versículo 37 le así. Porque nada hay imposible para Dios, que repetirlo, porque con Dios nada hay imposible. Y María dice en versículo 38, "He aquí la sierva del Señor, hágase conmigo conforme a tu palabra." Oremos. Padre lleno de gracia, estoy nervioso, estoy emocionado, estoy lleno de muchas cosas, Señor. Señor, que tú hagas toda cosa a un lado, Señor, porque tu pueblo está aquí esta noche. Yo creo que ellos han venido con una expectativa. Ellos saben que algo está a punto de suceder. Ellos saben que tú vas a derramarte porque tú los has estado visitando, Señor, en este ayuno. Tú has mirado su sacrificio, Señor. Tú has visto el hambre que tienen por ti, Señor. Señor, yo creo que has estado yendo a nuestro pastor para que tengamos estos servicios, para que te puedas mostrar de una manera increíble, Señor, para que yo con mis hermanos nos hagamos a un lado y levantemos la fe del pueblo para que tú te muestres en sus vidas esta noche. Te agradecemos por estas cosas en el nombre de Jesucristo. Amén. Puedan tomar sus asientos. Amén. Repítalo conmigo, porque con Dios nada será imposible. Tengo que repetir, porque con Dios nada será imposible. Amén. Podemos creer eso, iglesia. Lo hemos visto tras vez. Yo creo que lo miraremos en esos servicios. El hermano Branham dice en el mensaje fe, predicado el 1956, dice María la Virgen tomó en su palabra, tomó a Dios en su palabra. Lo imposible se hizo posible. Pero yo creo que la palabra de Dios, el Dios de lo imposible, no nos dio una palabra imposible para vivir. Escúcheme, iglesia, pero nos ha dado una palabra que usted y yo nos podemos identificar, que usted y yo podemos posicionar nuestra fe correctamente allí. Porque si María no hubiera dudado o cuestionado el ángel del Señor, si ella, la Biblia solo menciona que el ángel vino a María, le dijo que ella va a concibir un hijo y lo llamaría Jesús. Y luego dijo, "María, he aquí." Entonces, usted y yo nunca podemos basar nuestra fe allí. ¿Verdad? Pero yo le agradezco a Dios. Dios colocó el versículo 34 ahí para mí y para usted. Usted y yo nos podemos identificar con María. Sabemos que estamos buscando Dios de lo imposible. Estamos buscando un Dios grande, pero a veces nos encontramos bajo limitaciones humanas porque al fin del día somos humanos. Y igual que María, cuestionamos cuando la palabra de Dios viene a nuestra vida, nos dice lo que va a suceder, pero aún así tenemos razonamientos y preguntas. ¿O acaso soy el único? Soy el único, pero le agradezco a Dios que puso a María, que dijo, "¿Cómo va a suceder esto?" Pero el mensaje es fe. El menciona a María aquí, pero también menciona a Abraham. Y yo creo que aquí, usted y yo nos podemos identificar. Y dice esto, y Abraham tomó la palabra de Dios en lo imposible. Eso es clave o llave. Tomó a Dios en lo imposible hasta que se convirtió posible. Así que podemos mirar a María ahora como usted y yo, cuestionando la palabra de Dios. Se nos ha predicado la palabra vez tras vez y luego Dios nos las vuel explicar, pero podemos ver aquí que María, donde su fe de ella finalmente llegó a ser colocada. donde ella simplemente pudo decir, "¿Sabes qué, Dios? Ya estoy cansado y enfadada de tratar de entenderte. Estoy cansado de tratar de hacerlo mi manera. He aquí, he aquí la sierva del Señor. Haz como tú quieras, tu voluntad en mi vida. Yo creo que es tenemos que llegar a ese punto, iglesia, simplemente olvidarnos de lo demás y colocar nuestra fe en la palabra de Dios y tomarlo como él es. El hermano Branham dice en ese mismo mensaje, si cualquiera toma Dios en su palabra, su palabra se hará manifiesta. Y aquí está. Y si esa simiente cae en el terreno adecuado, ¿escucharon esto, iglesia? Si cae en el terreno adecuado, producirá exactamente lo que dijo, qué produciría. y amo esto porque hay algo sobre cuando alguien sabe lo que está hablando. Aquí el hermano BR dice, "Pongan eso en la grabación, pongan eso en la grabación", dice, "Estas cintas que salen, la actitud mental correcta." Hola, ¿está a alguien esta noche? Dice, "La actitud mental correcta hacia cualquier promesa divina de Dios hará que se cumpla si la mira correctamente y se dará cuenta quién hizo la promesa." Así que yo creo igual que María. Muchas veces nos encontramos escuchando la palabra de Dios. Pero de repente nos llega y nos damos cuenta quién verdaderamente nos está hablando. No es el hermano Gustavo, no es el hermano Alex, no es el hermano Eduardo o el hermano Félix, pero es el ángel del Señor usándolos para que abren a mi vida y luego yo puedo tomar mi fe en lo que ellos están hablando sobre la palabra de Dios, colocarla correctamente y traer la manifestación. a mi vida. Amén. Porque todos nos encontramos donde la lógica se nos acaba, ¿verdad? Estoy hablándole a alguien escuchando los testimonios hermosos el miércoles, perdón, el domingo. Gracias. Estoy hablándole a alguien que tal vez escuchó, que el doctor le dijo que ya no hay nada más que podemos hacer por usted. Estoy hablándole tal vez a alguien que por medio de estos días ha tenido problemas económicos, tal vez las cuentas no están saliendo. Tal vez le estoy hablando a alguien y yo no estoy casado. Tal vez tengan problemas de matrimonio, de relaciones. Tal vez ya no saben qué hacer. Tal vez la relación con su hijo, relación con su hija, tal vez usted está como yo, donde usted siente que mi fe está menguando, está debilitando, donde no puedo encontrar las palabras o la respuesta, pero las estoy buscando. Las estoy buscando, iglesia. Yo sé que hay un Dios lo imposible. Yo sé que hay un Dios que puede hacer lo imposible en mi vida. Pero aquí está la cosa. Lo imposible no es la limitación de Dios, es la invitación de Dios. Lo voy a repetir. Lo imposible no es la limitación de Dios. es la invitación de Dios a mi vida y para su vida. Yo estoy agradecido con Dios porque que la Biblia no solamente está basada historias de logros, pero es una colección de personas, de situaciones. Cuando se termina o acaba la habilidad humana, entonces ahí es cuando entra Dios. Pero muchas veces el nos quiere atacar allí en nuestra limitación humana. Pero quiero decir eso y quiero que lo digan conmigo. Yo soy humano y tengo limitaciones. Está bien. Podemos aceptarlo. Que somos limitados. En el libro de Mateo 19 dice, Jesús le está hablando a sus discípulos y dice, "Con hombre esto es imposible, pero amo lo que dice después. Pero con Dios todas las cosas son posibles." Estoy hablándole a alguien, ¿eso le ayuda a alguien? ¿En dando eso a alguien? Porque me ha estado ayudando a mí. Yo no puedo hacer cosas y está bien porque yo conozco un Dios que puede cuidar donde yo no puedo. Dios nunca niega la realidad, iglesia. Jesús claramente lo dice. Hay cosas que el hombre no puede hacer, pero si podemos aceptar eso y no permitir que el nos ataque con eso, porque al fin del día somos humanos, ¿verdad? Fallamos y fallamos y fallamos, ¿verdad? A veces el nos quiere atacar allí y estamos avanzando, estamos en este ayuno y queremos avanzar, queremos crecer, queremos mejorarnos, pero después caemos o fallamos o quedamos cortos, llegamos a nuestros límites y luego el nos quiere atacar allí y decir que eso no era real. Lo que estabas haciendo no era genuino, porque si fuera real y genuino, no estuvieras batallando, quedando corto o fallando. Estoy hablándole a alguien allí. Pero muchas veces si nos encontramos desanimados y eso está bien, iglesia, porque a menudo nos hallamos desanimados porque estamos esperando por respuestas humanas para o soluciones humanas para problemas divinos. Lo voy a repetir. Estamos buscando soluciones humanas, soluciones humanas para problemas divinos. Muchas veces tratamos de adelantarnos en Dios. Queremos que las cosas se hagan a nuestro tiempo. Supuestamente queremos ayudarle a Dios. Pero en vez de ayudarle a Dios, nos desanimamos a nosotros aún más porque estamos esperando algo que está fuera de nuestro alcance y está bien porque donde no podamos alcanzar, Dios nos da las pulgadas extras que nos faltan. Ahora, mi pregunta para usted es, ¿en dónde está su fe colocada? está colocada en sus habilidades o la está colocando en las habilidades de Dios, en el carácter de Dios, porque mientras vamos avanzando en esos servicios se va a poner más y más difícil. El va a querer detenerlo, detenerlo, hacernos dudar para que no recibamos lo que es para nosotros. Pero si podemos hacer lo mismo que hizo María, igual que Abraham, igual colocar nuestra fe en la palabra de Dios y lo podemos hacer lo mismo que Abraham y María hicieron. creer a Dios en lo imposible hasta que llegue lo posible. Amén. Dios los bendiga. Dios los bendiga. Les dio la bienvenida en el nombre del Señor Jesucristo. Voy a estar leyendo unas escrituras. Les sugiero que simplemente las escrib. Las voy a leer rápidamente aquí. Mateo 17:20. Jesús les dijo, "Porque por vuestra poca fe, porque de cierto os digo que si tuvieres fe como un grano de mostaza, diréis a este monte, pásate de aquí allá y se pasará y nada os será imposible. Lucas 18:27. Él les dijo, "Lo que es imposible para los hombres es posible para Dios." Hebreos 11:6. Pero sin fe es imposible agradar a Dios, porque es necesario que el que se acerque a Dios crea que le hay y que es galardonador de los que le buscan. El Dios de lo imposible. ¿Cuántos creen eso? Amén. Como decía nuestro hermano Gustavo, nuestro título es fe posicionalmente colocada, correctamente colocada, perdón. Nosotros como seres humanos, nosotros medimos nuestro ambiente de acuerdo a nuestras propias fuerzas y entendimiento. Pero la manera que Dios mide las cosas, Dios mide las cosas a través de su naturaleza. Ahora hemos escuchado nuestro profeta que fe es el sexto sentido, que fe es el canal directo a Dios. Ahora, cuando los discípulos querían echar fuera un demonio de un muchacho, no pudieron hacerlo. Y la razón fue Jesús les dijo, "Fue por su incredulidad. Si solo tuvieran fe como del tamaño de semilla de mostaza, pueden mover montañas y nada sería imposible para ustedes. Déjeme decirle, hermanos, si usted tiene la fe correcta, fe correcta y genuina, nada le será imposible para usted. que Jesús dijo, Jesús no dijo que sería posible con Dios. Jesús dijo, "No será imposible a ti." Él nos dio la autoridad a nosotros. Y ahora la el tamaño de la del tamaño de semilla de mostaza obra no porque tiene la fuerza por ella misma, pero porque está colocada y está conectada directamente a Dios, a un Dios todopoderoso. No se trata de cuánto usted tenga, pero es en quién usted lo ponga, en qué lo posicione usted. Depende de nosotros, en quién le pongamos nuestra fe, a quién vamos a correr cuando estemos enfrente de lo imposible, cuando lleguemos a nuestras limitaciones, nuestras limitaciones humanas, porque lo imposible solamente está en nuestro vocabulario, no existe en el vocabulario de Dios. Dios no conoce que es lo imposible. Como humanos tenemos limitaciones, pero Dios no. Dios es un Dios sin límites. Déjeme decirle, hermanos, Dios es un caballero. Él no va a forzar sus obras en un corazón que no esté dispuesto, un corazón que no esté dispuesto en en colocar su fe. Ve la incredulidad no limita a Dios. Simplemente está limitado lo que podemos experimentar con Dios. Limita los beneficios que podemos tener con Dios, porque con incredulidad nos hace falta ese canal directo con Dios, nos hace falta los recursos con Dios porque fe es la certeza, las cosas que se esperan. La convicción de las cosas que no se ven. La fe se conecta a la otra esfera, donde nuestras respuestas se encuentran, donde nuestra ayuda se encuentra. Por eso tenemos que tener fe genuina y no solamente fe genuina, pero fe genuina colocado en Dios, en Dios. Es un sacrificio que tenemos que hacer para Dios. Tenemos que morir en nuestras vidas y dejar rendir todo a sus pies, tomar nuestra cruz diario y seguirlo. El hermano Branham dice, "En la resurrección de Lázaro, predicado en el año 51, miren, deidad, yo soy una parte de Charles Branham. Porque nací de Charlie Branham, mi papá. Yo soy parte de él. Yo tengo la frente como la de él. Mi cabello era como el de él. Soy un hombre pequeño como él. Soy igual en naturaleza como él, porque él es mi papá. Y si nosotros llegamos a ser en espíritu hijos de Dios, te da la vida en el hombre. Entonces usted habla sobre ojos ciegos siendo abiertos. Ellos dicen que no hay nada imposible para Dios. Dios dice que no hay nada imposible con usted si lo va a creer, no con Dios, con usted de edad en el hombre, el mismo Dios que estuvo allí atrás en la plataforma mítica de las eternidades y que sacó mundos de sus manos y creó estas cosas que le da a usted privilegio de ser su hijo y usted es parte de él. Y Dios mora en la humanidad y el hombre mismo es deidad. Ahí lo tienen, eso los puede atragantar. Pero estudie eso un poco. Ven, Dios habita en el hombre y el hombre llegó a ser hijo de Dios, no de por sí, sino el Espíritu Santo que está en él es Dios. El creador vive en la creación o vaya. ¿Cómo pienso de eso? Después páese con una fe inquebrantable y pida lo que quiera le será hecho. Deidad está en el hombre, es el Espíritu Santo dentro de nosotros. Pero para llegar a ese punto se toma un sacrificio, una dedicación que tenemos que hacer. Tenemos que negar a nuestros propios deseos, nuestras ambiciones, nuestra voluntad y poder obedecer la voluntad de él y tomar nuestra cruz. Él requiere nuestra obediencia total, nuestra rendimiento total en orden para seguirlo. Tenemos que estar completamente consagrados y una vida rendida. para producir resultados imposibles. Dios solamente usa lo que nosotros le damos. Por ejemplo, Sansón le dio a Dios sus fuerzas, pero no su corazón. Dios pudo usar sus fuerzas, pero tarde o temprano Samson fracasó. Porque nunca le rendió a Dios su corazón. Dios solamente puede usar lo que usted le dé a él. Por eso él no puede usar un corazón que no esté dispuesto. ¿Saben? Las realidades infalibles del Dios vivo. ¿Qué puede usted dar? Dios recibirá lo que usted le dará. Pero escuche aquí, iglesia. Pero Dios lo quiere todo a usted. Él quiere cada porcioncita de usted. Él quiere todo. Él quiere todo lo que usted es. Él quiere su vida, él quiere su testimonio. Él quiere cada minuto de su vida. Él quiere que usted viva bien, actúe bien, hable bien, obre bien. Él quiere todo perfectamente rendido a él para que él pueda dirigirlo y guiarlo y llevarlo a lugares donde él quiere que usted vaya. Depende de nosotros, iglesia. Si usted siente que le falta fe esta noche, diga, "Señor, aumenta mi fe. Dame fe genuina y ayúdame a posicionar en tus manos, en las manos del todopoderoso. Es la única manera para recibir algo de Dios." Es lo que dijo el hermano Branham. La única cosa que podemos recibir de Dios es por medio de la fe. Moisés liberó al pueblo por medio de la fe. Gedeón por fe pudo ir a la guerra. Josué por fe conquistó la tierra prometida. Jesús por fe caminó esta tierra con el hombre. él mismo siendo Dios y siguió la voluntad de Dios por su vida. Es todo por medio de la fe, pero no solo fe. Fe correctamente posicionada. Fe, fe sin obras es muerte. Por eso esta noche, iglesia, tenemos que comenzar a testificar, testificar nuestra liberación. testifique su bendición. Las bendiciones que vienen para usted pueden venir esta noche o esta semana, las el mes que viene, tal vez en algunos años, pero tarde o temprano sucederá porque mi Dios lo ha dicho y mi Dios cumple cada promesa. Y eso es fe, hermanos. poder creer en Dios, confiar en Dios hasta que él cumpla lo que ha prometido. ¿Sabe? Esta semana esta semana no va a ser limitada por Dios. Esta semana va a ser limitada por lo que usted está dispuesto a creer. Así que iglesia esta noche hay que creer. Si no tiene fe, pida Señor, aumenta mi fe. Señor, si no confío en ti, ayúdame a colocar mi vida en tus manos. Ayúdame a poner todo lo que yo soy en tus manos. Ayúdame a verdaderamente rendirme mi vida, mis mi tiempo, mi fe, mi corazón, mi alma. A ti, Señor. Es la única manera, iglesia, un corazón completamente consagrado a Dios y fe genuina colocada en él. Hay que comenzar a testificar, iglesia. El hermano Branham dice que María tuvo más que creer que Zacarías, el padre de Juan el Bautista. Ahora, Zacarías tenía ejemplos previos. tuvo Abraham, tuvo a Ana y aún con esos ejemplos, él batalló en creer en lo imposible. Pero María, María pudo creer en lo imposible y ella no esperó para una señal que ella iba a concebir un bebé. Ella comenzó a testificar rápido. Ella dijo, "Yo tendré un bebé porque mi Dios me dijo, yo voy a tener este niño y su nombre será Jesús y será Dios caminando con el hombre y sería el salvador de Israel." Ella no esperó por los sentimientos. Ella no esperó por las señales. Ella simplemente creyó en el Dios de lo imposible y testificó. Cualquier cosa que usted esté esperando, cualquier cosa que usted esté pidiendo, se le hará a usted si solamente usted puede creer, porque nada con Dios es imposible. Y nada, nada con usted será imposible. Simplemente ríndase usted a él esta noche. Dios los bendiga. Amén. ¿Cómo se sienten, iglesia? Yo solamente quiero decirle esto ahorita. Todo es posible con Dios. Si usted lo cree, si no tiene ninguna duda, si usted cree en Dios, si tiene fe en Dios, si tiene fe en su palabra, todo es posible. La Biblia dice en Isaías 43:19, dice, "He aquí, yo hago cosa nueva. Pronto saldrá a luz, no la conoceréis. Otra vez abriré camino en el desierto y ríos. En la soledad, Dios se especializa en lugares donde no hay salida. Cuando se termina el camino para usted, allí es donde el camino empieza para Dios. Ahí es donde empieza la fe. Cuando tú llegas al fin del camino, ahí es donde Dios empieza. Aquí es donde Dios abre camino. Viene la duda. A veces llegamos al fin del camino, no miramos ninguna otra salida, otro camino. No hay otro camino. Cuando cuando se nos da el el reporte médico y el doctor nos dice algo diferente, nos dice el resultado que no esperábamos. Cuando llega el problema financiero, cuando pierdes tu empleo, cuando no recibes el empleo que estabas esperando, cuando tu negocio se va a la quiebra, cuando tu tu negocio se va a la quiebra, cuando no hay salida, cuando oramos y seguimos orando, y seguimos orando y decimos que tenemos fe, pero no hay respuesta a esa oración. ¿Qué es lo que hacemos? Aleluya. María, cuando ella recibió esa noticia que desfiaba la biología, la lógica y cultura. No había ni siquiera ninguna expectativa, no había ninguna prueba. Pero escuche esto, iglesia. Había una promesa. Había una promesa en su palabra. Había algo especial en esa palabra. Dios la encuentra en ese lugar donde no había ninguna posibilidad y él lo hizo posible. Mir, yo digo esto por mí mismo. A veces dependemos tanto, dependemos de nuestra facultad humana muchas de las veces. Yo puedo hacer esto. Yo tengo la habilidad, tengo la fuerza, tengo el negocio, el plan del negocio. Yo tengo que que puede vencer esas enfermedades. Miramos lo que podemos, confiamos en lo que podemos, lo que podemos ver, lo que podemos tocar, lo que podemos medir, lo que podemos controlar. Pero déjeme decirle algo, hermano Víctor, hermano Víctor, brother Victor, brother Victor. Nuestra facultad humana o la naturaleza humana tiene limitaciones, tiene un fin, tiene algo que los para. Por eso, cuando se nos dan unas malas noticias, el temor viene a nosotros. La la el fallo de esperanza, la negatividad nos oprime, nos quiere quebrar, nos lleva a lugares donde empezamos a cuestionar a Dios. ¿Por qué tenemos que atravesar por esto? Decimos, ¿por qué esto está sucediendo en mi vida? ¿Por qué no estoy recibiendo las respuestas que yo estoy pidiendo? Oh, la batalla se pone más dura. Cuando empezamos a cuestionar eso, cuando empezamos a decir, "Esto es difícil, no lo puedo hacer. Ahí es cuando estamos dependiendo de nuestras habilidades humanas. Ahí es donde estamos dependiendo dependiendo de nuestros sentimientos, dependiendo de lo que podemos ver. Yo sé que duele. Yo sé que duele cuando esas cosas se quebran. María no entendía lo que estaba sucediendo. Ella no estaba entendiendo lo que estaba pasando. No entendía lo que Dios estaba haciendo, pero ella creyó no importando. Iglesia no miró a las circunstancias. A veces es lo que tenemos que hacer, hermano Timy. No tenemos que ver a las circunstancias, no tenemos que ver lo que está pasando alrededor de nosotros, no lo que nos está doliendo. Tenemos que mirar a la palabra de Dios. ¿Sabe qué, hermanos? No entiendo toda la palabra, ni siquiera sé leer muy bien. Pero, ¿sabe qué? Yo creo en la palabra. Yo creo en la manifestación de la palabra, que él nunca nos va a dejar. Él estará siempre con nosotros sin importar lo que pasa en nuestras vidas. Si tan solo pudiéramos creer eso, hermano Samuel. Hermano Samuel, si pudiéramos creer eso, Dios hará lo imposible. Él moverá en una en algo sobrenatural. Los doctores ni siquiera tendrán respuesta. Cuando se terminan tus finanzas, Dios proveerá. Así es. Cree y confía en Dios. No creas en tus propias habilidades. No creas en tu dinero. No confíes en qué tan inteligente eres. Hermano Víctor, no confiemos en qué tan inteligentes somos. Tenemos que confiar en lo que Dios dijo. Tenemos que confiar en lo que Dios ha dicho. Eso es la diferencia. Nuestra fe no lo niega, no niega la situación que estamos atravesando. Nuestra fe declara que Dios es más grande que nuestra situación. Nuestra fe pone la confianza en Dios. Pone la confianza en Dios y en su palabra. No en el hermano Félix, no en el hermano Tito, no en el que está predicando. Cuando su fe, iglesia, tiene que estar confiada en Dios. Ahí es donde su fe empieza a trabajar. Cuando usted no confía en su propia carne, ahí es donde Dios puede mover montañas. Dios puede ayudarte por el desierto. Te puede ayudar por el desierto. Ese es el mismo Dios que abrió el Mar Rojo, que provió fe a Abraham. Eso fue lo mismo que pasó con María, el mismo Dios que estaba con María, el mismo Dios que estaba con Jesús. Estaba leyendo algo ayer y este este muchacho lo describe de esta manera. Dice, dijo, cuando Pedro caminó sobre las aguas, confió en Dios. Tal vez hubiera podido brincarse ayer en el agua y hubiera podido agarrarse del barco, pero él confió en la palabra de Dios. Si tan solo pudiéramos confiar en la palabra de Dios, él puede hacer mucho, hermanos. Cuando tenemos fe, estamos colocados en terrenos más altos porque Dios es más grande. Él es un Dios sobrenatural. Todos los otros dioses de este mundo están en la tierra, están muertos, pero nuestro Dios todavía sigue viviendo en esta noche. Si hay alguien que lo puede decir en esta noche, "Mi Dios todavía vive. Mi Dios todavía está aquí. Yo no sirvo a un Dios muerto, sirvo a un Dios vivo. Vamos, iglesia, lo quiero escuchar. Alguien puede decir, "Sirvo a un Dios vivo. Él me ayudará no importando la circunstancia." Hermano, Tito, Dios me va a ayudar, no importando qué, no importando qué le estoy batallando, no importa qué tan feo se viene el camino, Dios habrará un camino. Si hay alguien que lo pueda creer en esta noche, hay alguien que pueda decirle amén a la palabra. Aleluya. Aleluya. No importando que estemos enfrentando en esta noche, Dios le va a ayudar a pasar eso. El hermano Branam dice eso. No importa las circunstancias en cualquier otra cosa. Uno no cuestiona la palabra de Dios. Uno solamente la cree, solamente la puede creer, iglesia, no importando lo que esté pasando, crea en Dios. Mire, su carne solamente mide lo que usted alcanza a ver, lo que sentimos, lo que entendemos. Pero al otro lado, al otro lado de la carne, hay un Dios sobrenatural que nos ha dado fe, nos ha dado todo. Dios no está limitado. Dios no está limitado por el tiempo. No se le acaba los recursos a Dios. Él no se le acaba los milagros a Dios. No se le acaba de las habilidades. A él nunca se le acaba nada. ¿Sabe por qué? Porque servimos a un Dios infinito. Creemos en un Dios vivo. Servimos a un Dios de milagros. ¿Sabe por qué? Porque él es el mismo de hoy, de ayer y por todos los siglos. El mismo Dios. Él siempre está viviendo. Si los músicos pueden pasar. Aleluya. Aleluya. Lo que se siente imposible para nosotros es tan simple, es un simple, una simple materia para Dios poder trabajar. Yo creo que él puede trabajar con nosotros, iglesia, si tan solo podemos creer. Si tan solo puedes creer en eso, eso es todo lo que necesitamos. Si tan solo podemos creer en eso, no tenga ninguna duda, iglesia. Puede estar enfermo, puede tal vez sin dinero, no tener dinero, tal vez sus oraciones no han sido contestadas, pero él está aquí en esta noche. Él sabe y conoce lo que usted está atravesando. El hermano Branham dice este extracto, dice, "Hermano mío, no tema a pedirle a Dios cualquier cosa. Usted debe exigirle a Dios. Pídale a Dios todo lo que él haya prometido. Iglesia, él lo ha prometido. Él puede hacer algo sobrenatural en esta noche. Aleluya. Tal vez has estado batallándole con algo, tal vez has estado luchando con algo. Tú siempre me escuchas decir esto. No sé lo que tú estás pasando y esa es la realidad. Yo no sé lo que tú estás atravesando, pero Dios sabe exactamente lo que tú estás pasando. Él sabe lo que tú le estás batallando. Él sabe qué batalla le estás batallando, qué enfermedad estás batallando. Sabe, él sabe lo que te duele. Él sabe lo que tú le estás dudando a él. Él sabe lo que te está doliendo a ti. Aleluya. Aleluya. Su presencia está aquí en esta noche, iglesia. Él puede remover y quitar cualquier duda. Él es un Dios sobrenatural. Que nada te detenga, iglesia. No esperes para otro servicio. No esperes para otro tiempo. Él está aquí en esta noche. Él se está moviendo y él está esperando en ti que tú le aceptes. No sé de usted, pero yo lo creo con todo mi corazón. Espere su sanidad. Él puede cambiar de algo imposible a algo posible. Si tan solo usted lo puede creer, si podemos poner nuestra confianza solamente en Dios, iglesia, ponga su confianza en Dios. Él está aquí en esta noche. Vamos a adorar. El altar está abierto. que tiene tu espíritu, que cuando me toca me hace temblar y que es tu presencia y al manifestarse tengo que llorar. Es que soy tan pequeño, al tocarme, siento que voy a desmayar. Es que sé que a tu presencia no hay aquí en la tierra con que comparar. No te puedo mirar ni te puedo tocar.

Amén. Amén. ¿Sabe? Le voy a dar una un hint. ¿Cómo se dice? Le voy a dar una ayuda. Tiene que usted saber de que usted ya es un ganador. No importa qué pase, no importa qué suceda, ya somos ganadores. Tenemos a Dios con nosotros. Todo va a salir bien, todo está bien. Entonces, deberíamos de saber eso y actuar como si ya Dios nos dio lo que estábamos esperando. Una de las maneras que ponemos nuestra fe a actuar en acción es de que actuamos o hacemos como si ya tenemos lo que estamos pidiendo. Así que si Dios ya le dio lo que usted ya ha estado pidiendo, usted puede adorarle, usted puede declarar victoria, usted puede decir, "Gracias, Señor." Usted no tiene por qué estar triste o dudando. Usted ya lo mira. Esa es la fe. Esa es la fe. ¿Sabes? No tengo duda en mi corazón que Dios colocó estos servicios para nosotros. Dios dijo, "Mis hijos necesitan algo. Mis hijos necesitan más de mí. Mis hijos necesitan liberación. Mis hijos necesitan de su Espíritu Santo. Mis hijos están pidiendo por un nuevo nacimiento. Así que voy a darles lo que ellos están pidiendo. Yo vengo decidido a zambullirme en el agua todos los servicios. Yo no estoy esperando un servicio. Yo voy a aprovechar cada uno de ellos. Porque yo sé que en cualquier momento él va a responder. Él va a responder porque ya lo ha hecho y él lo va a seguir haciendo. La Biblia dice que somos la iglesia, usted y yo somos la iglesia que iba a prevalecer. Diga, voy a prevalecer. Somos la iglesia. que íbamos a prevalecer en contra del reino de Satanás. No estoy esperando otra iglesia, no estoy esperando otro mensaje, no estoy esperando otra revelación. Yo sé que esta es la revelación que va a prevalecer en contra del enemigo. Yo sé que esta es la iglesia. Yo sé que estos son los jóvenes. Yo sé que estos son los hombres y mujeres de Dios que van a prevalecer. Vamos a prevalecer en contra del enemigo. Nosotros no somos de los que le damos la vuelta al No somos de los que le huyos a Satanás. Vamos a prevalecer y estamos determinados hasta que lo miremos debajo de nuestros pies. ¿Cuántos saben que usted es parte de esa iglesia? Somos llamados para echar fuera demonios. Somos llamados para poner las manos sobre los enfermos y ellos sanarían. Somos llamados para tener el Espíritu Santo. Somos llamados para vivir una vida victoriosa. No, no el pastor, no el ministro, no a alguien más. Diga, "Yo yo soy llamado para eso." Amén. Aleluya. Aleluya. El está molesto. Él tiene miedo. Tiene miedo porque hemos estado pasando buenos tiempos con Dios y déjeme decirle, solo se va a poner más bueno. Y el tiene miedo porque nos ha enviado de todo, pero aquí estamos todavía. Nos ha usado todas las armas en su artillería, pero aquí estamos todavía y estamos más fuertes que antes. Estamos más dispuestos que antes. Así que, iglesia, vamos fuerte. Vamos fuerte. Amén. Aleluya. Yo sé que vamos a mirar grandes cosas. Ya, ya comenzamos. Ya comenzamos a mirar grandes cosas. Dios bendiga la palabra. Pueden tomar sus lugares. Discúlpenme. Amén. Ahí. Amén. Dios bendiga la palabra. Qué palabra, ¿verdad? Yo me gocé con cada una de ellas. La fe de María. La fe de María. ¿Cuántos se identifican con María? ¿Sabe, estamos en una situación muy similar a la de María? Nadie ha vivido lo que lo que estamos viviendo ahora. Estamos viviendo en la peor edad, en el peor momento. Y y es en este tiempo donde vamos a hacer algo que nadie ha hecho. Nadie ha hecho. Una novia va a ser transformada. Su cuerpo natural va a ser transformada. de algo corruptible a algo incorruptible. Nosotros nos estamos preparando para recibir al Dios eterno en el aire. Oh, déjeme decirle, yo creo que Dios tiene la fe de María aún aquí en este tiempo, en usted y en mí. A veces pensamos que no somos suficientes, pero Dios pensó suficiente en nosotros para enviarnos en este tiempo, llamarnos a este mensaje para creer esta palabra para esta hora. Y si él creyó en nosotros, yo creo en nosotros, yo creo en mí. Yo creo en que Dios me ha dado lo que necesito para traer su palabra manifestación. ¿Cuántos lo creen, iglesia? Vamos a Bueno, yo puedo seguir predicando, pero yo sé que algunos tienen que ir a trabajar y este vamos a vamos a ser despedidos. Mañana las puertas se abran a las 6:30. Va a haber oración de 6:30 7 para que guste venir a prepararse más. Ah, vamos a escuchar palabras de nuestro hermano Branham de las 7 a las 7:10 y el servicio comienza a las 7:15. Hay que disfrutar estos últimos 7 días. Miren, el año bien bien va a venir fuerte y lo que hagamos ahorita, lo que hagamos ahorita va a determinar cómo vamos a pelear este año, si lo vamos a pelear con muchas fuerzas o vamos a estar medios deiluchos. Hay que aprovecharlo. No va a tener otra oportunidad como esta en el año. Aprovéchelo. La limitación no es Dios. La limitación es somos nosotros. ¿Me están escuchando? Iglesia. La limitación no es Dios. Él no se está limitando para nosotros. Él no se está limitando para usted, está en nosotros. Creámosle. Y hay que aprovechar estos días y haga algo diferente. Salga de su zona de conforte, haga algo que no ha hecho. Adórele como nunca le ha adorado. La la adoración tiene efecto también. Así como su fe tiene efecto, la adoración levanta su fe. La adoración la ayuda, lo acerca más a Dios. Adórele. No espere los sentimientos. Adórele desde su corazón, no desde sus sentimientos. Adórele desde su corazón. Si hay algo en su corazón, por Dios, sáquelo. Sáquelo. La Biblia dice que aquellos santos sacaron fuerza de la debilidad. A veces parece que no hay nada allí, pero créame, allí está. Créame, allí está. Si no, no estaríamos aquí. A veces parece que no hay nada ahí, pero ahí está. Sáquelo. La Biblia dice que levantemos manos santas a él. Es palabra de Dios que levante sus manos. Es palabra de Dios que le adore. La Biblia dice, "Todo lo que respire adore al Señor." ¿Cuántos están respirando en esta mañana en esta tarde? Vamos. Mire, si usted cumple la palabra, Dios cumple la palabra también. Usted solamente ríndase a su palabra y él lo va a hacer. Amén. Los niños y dice los niños y después hermana Lisa tienen práctica de canto al terminar el servicio. Por favor quedarse en sus asientos y no salir. Y nuestra hermana Gisela Saedo de Silao dice, "Pido oración por nuestro hermano Cosme Aguirre para que nuestro Señor y Salvador Jesucristo le dé su sanidad y lo fortalezca. Vamos a ponernos de pie despedidos. Dele gracias a Dios. Como decían nuestros hermanos, testifique, testifique de lo que Dios está haciendo. Él ya está obrando, él ya está trabajando. Vamos aar nuestro rostro y vamos a orar y darle gracias a Dios. Verdaderamente, verdaderamente, Señor, se siente estos servicios especiales porque tus hijos están aquí, son especiales. Muchos hemos entrado ya en el espíritu y sabemos que tú tienes el control de todo. Estamos en expectativa en estos servicios porque cualquier cosa puede suceder. Si alguno no ha recibido su liberación, este es su año. Si alguno está esperando su sanidad, este es su año. Y estamos confiando porque tú eres el Dios de lo imposible en el poderoso gran conquistador que es el Señor Jesucristo. Y estamos en expectativa una vez más. Te pedimos también que bendigas las manos que están levantadas, que tú cumplas sus peticiones, sus deseos de su corazón y nos ponemos en tus manos, sabiendo que tú eres el Dios del ayer, de hoy y de siempre. Y esperamos venir el próximo servicio en expectativa y de antemano ya estamos agradecidos por lo que tú estás haciendo y lo que vas a hacer. Ahora te pedimos que bendigas a nuestra hermana que está en Silao, que cumpla su petición porque creemos en un Dios de sanidades, de milagros y cualquier cosa puede suceder. Auméntanos más la fe para creerte, porque tú puedes hacer todo, solamente que te creamos. dijo el profeta, todo es posible si puedes creer. Y te pedimos que ayudes a nuestra hermana allá donde está y te damos gracias de antemano por todo. A los que nos miran por medio del internet, sabemos que ellos también pueden recibir allá lo que ellos están pidiendo. Y antemano ya estamos agradecidos porque todo lo que pasa es con un propósito y el propósito es formar carácter, carácter cristiano, y todas las cosas nos ayudan para bien para tus hijos. Entonces, te damos gracias por toda la ayuda y nos ponemos en tus manos. Todo esto te lo pedimos y te damos gracias en el nombre del Señor Jesucristo. Amén. Estamos despedidos. Quiero estar bien poco en mi conforte porque todavía no he acabado de alabarle a mi Dios. No importa lo que venga a hacer, no importa lo que el mundo diga. Lo que yo sé because I'm happy.
