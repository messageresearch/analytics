[Music] for the opportunity and those congregate it says like this is Mio disquieted Within Me hoped on God for I shall yet praise him who is who is the health of my countenance and my God this is the apostles chapter 13 verse 21 and 22. as a title this evening my brothers and myself this is waiting upon your day waiting for your day this is and after with the desire to King and God get God gave unto them Saul the king of the son of sis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised it raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave testimonies that I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will you may be seated may the Lord we've already preached to us previously Israel was in a situation we're going to put it that it was they wanted to denominate themselves as the rest of the Nations and because Samuel was old yeah as a priest or judges but they weren't doing it according to the word of God Dios even though he was King of the Jews he was a king of Israel and we see in Deuteronomy 17 14 and 15. see what Moses wrote before they crossed the Jordan verse 14 says when they are coming to the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee and shall possess it and shall dwell therein and shall say I will say the king over me like as all the nations that are about me in any way set him King over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose one from among thy Brethren shalt thou said King over thee thou mayest not set a stranger overly which is not thy brothers so here we see that the word of the Lord is perfect perfect because God is perfect God is not going to be surprised he's not going to be surprised by anything we're thinking anything we're doing we do things that we don't want our parents our brothers but the one we have to hide from we can't hide from and we're only going in circles and we can you're free no they wanted a king in the first Samuel 9 16. 17 that he was going to send someone that he was going to be the king of Israel so God was working and chapter 9 says that the father of saw he he lost some some oxen but there we see the hand of God [Music] because uh Saul's father he didn't send to service verse 16 says Pueblo tomorrow about this time I will send the Amanda of the land of Benjamin and thou shall anoint him to be a captain Over My People Israel that he may save my people out of the hand of Philistines for I have looked upon my people because their cries come unto me and when Samuel saw when Samuel Saul the Lord said unto him behold the man whom I spake to thee of this this same shall reign over my people I want to read a quote from the prophet uh in this great warrior David preaching 55. yes but now Israel wanted to impersonate the other people and that's what the church wants to do to him personally they come back slitting condition in this condition then what did they do is they went to find their King and when they did they found the biggest handsomest man they could find great big seven footer with black shaggy hair dark sparkling guys that would be attractive to the people and they thought he'll make a wonderful King is But as God said to Samuel looketh but as but God said to Samuel man look at on the outward appearance but God looketh on the heart when Israel uh selected their King they wanted a great big handsome strong looking fellow with big shoulders and straight standing Head and Shoulders above all of his armies but when God selected his King for them a little Ruddy sapling looking kind of fellow looked a little like a and that was God's pick of it what a difference see the difference in it that's just the way God does things sometimes in such ways as so country so different from what we think with these things in the Bible in the message God chose their King but how can we find the center according to the heart of man the way that they chose him not the way that God wanted it hold up no cuando cuando Saul is so he told him he told them various things that were going to go on on his way home and one of the things that he told him was that when he was that he would wait seven days there he confirms that God changes so they say it says it is no no this is and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel God gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day so there we can see that God was with David or with Saul now in his first battle it says that he came with the with the donkey socking with the donkey noticias and when they gave him the bad news says that the power of God Came Upon him and so in God is supporting the kingdom of Saul but all right but unfortunately it's talking in weight why because when he was in surrounded by the Philistines and the fear had gone had overcome because the Army was it was uh separate he was it was deserting and seven days had been given already had wasn't arriving yet and so then sometimes why don't we wait on God because we get desperate we get fearful and we can't wait can't wait on what God has for us all the Bible says if you were just waited nueve Samuel 13 9 says and he turned seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but Samuel came now to Gilda and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring Heather a burnt offering to me in peace offerings and he offer the burnt offering sometimes and Desperation they make us screw up to take wrong decisions not waiting upon the guidance of God but it wasn't that way with David knew had a way peaceably foreign [Music] but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I've refused him for the Lord to see it not as man see it for man looketh on the outward appearance for the Lord looked down the heart but the Bible says that Samuel was going to anoint a king the prophet says that when his when his dad is when his father and mother is when when they're when they came and they seen their tallest son they said all the crown would look really and his wife that through the prophet bro sometimes the emotion when you get emotional now waiting upon the will of God and we're seeing it here then because of their emotions they went by their natural way of seeing along with Samuel because God hadn't told him but he just said the Lord says he was afraid to anoint a son of Jesse sometimes youth when the emotion takes you out of the way of God the guys then that's when it's not okay let's place an example sometimes when there's a lot of people from various ages young man begins to talk with the young lady then another one with another and correct I don't think it happens here but I mean sometimes that are already talking with the youth they're encouraging the others look at that brother and they get happy they get excited and they don't wait on God you don't want to wait on God of God how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages as Lambs led to the slaughter fielmentes lovingly Faithfully that is all they wanted out of life your service to their lord how great was to be the rewards I say that David knew how to wait on God I don't want to mean I don't mean to say that he he just sat on a bench and waited he had already been called he took action but he waited on God with his reflection my brother can get ready it says the most important is for you to recognize God as a as your only King and that you do what he asked of you God will give you in your time all that you need the Elizabeth God bless you [Applause] thank you amen God bless your brothers please open your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31. first of all I want to give thanks to God no for allowing me to be here along with you Brothers I don't deserve to be here in reality we all don't deserve to be yeah but it's by God's grace that we are here amen Brothers I also want to give thanks to my pastor for giving me the trust to be behind this Puppet Man he's over there in Denver at least in Denver let's keep our brother John in prayer amen amen and the word of God says like this but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength Isaiah 40 verse 31. they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles and it says like this it is I waited patiently for the Lord [Music] amen Brothers amen Hermanos the title in which me and my brothers is waiting for your day as esperando sudia I believe that I will have my day but I also believe that you will have your day too man we are on the Bible character which is you know which I already I I believe that all of us should already know that story you know from the beginning well I don't want the story of David I wanted to just be a story in the past I wanted to bring it to our time no I believe that we're all not perfect we all have our doubts we'll have our flaws we all have our struggles too and if there's one thing is that we struggle with or we don't like okay there's someone who can identify it is if there's one thing that we don't like you see God can work in us but we have patience because God works when we are waiting no we can learn a lot from King David you see David wasn't a perfect man you see but what stood out of David was that David was a man confirmed to the heart of Christ you see he was a man who was faithful to Christ and he had a patient you see when David was anointed from that day and forward you see David I believe that he begins to start having the right expectations and the correct vision correct because of the presence of God many other times we have goals we have dreams that in reality is in disagreement with our true calling to what God has brought us and for a while Brothers we start working we are working for something that has nothing to do with our true calling level in which we were created you see but when we find that encounter with God when we have that experience we will start to realize that we invested too much time the things that we didn't need to invest in the first place and we start to realize that we invented we invested money we invested strength and efforts and things that are not even close to our purpose we will realize that what God has for us what God has foreign there is no foreign to describe Our Calling foreign thank God getting David ready for something great God Was preparing David to be a great king you see we must understand that's the loneliness and the difficult times that we're going to go through it is just God getting us ready for something and although we might go through trials although we might go through struggles although we might go through the fire although we might go through pain in the midst of that God is preparing us for something the life of young David shall be forever see God wants to use us and you know what he can use it he can use use each and every one of you because he knows what we are capable with him by our side you see God wants to use our gifts because we all have gifts foreign yes amen amen when David was anointed king David didn't become the King right away he had to wait 15 years prior to his anointing the espresso said on here though although the spirit of God came to David okay David didn't go running off saying I am the new king of Israel you see he was anointed however he stood still and waited on the Lord you see David is an example of patience the Holy Spirit was upon David had that power but he waited he stood still said in the same way Brothers we're in so much of a hurry sometimes Brothers when we amen so then God can use our gifts we should stop being the man or woman right that once that you want to be start being the man or woman that God wants us stop being the man or woman that pleases themselves yes that pleases the Lord stop being the Persona that looks for their own pleasure and start seeking what pleases the Lord let's stop walking in our own time and start walking in God's time you see Brothers not only no solamentes are we impatientes when it comes to letting God use us as these instruments but I believe we're also impatient when the bad times come unto us you see then David when he fought Goliath David didn't see David didn't see Goliath's strength because he already knew which God had it you see Brothers it doesn't matter no importa how powerful the depression it doesn't matter how how powerful the addictions might look like the anxiety you know although the pain and the struggles will be in front of us we should know that we have something greater behind us amen Brothers I want to read a quote by Brother Branham and it's called perseverance preached in 1962. and it says like this the trouble of it which with we people we're in too much of a hurry it's just got to be done right now can't come back no more and we when you get that in your mind you're going to lose you're on losing grounds right there nothing to stand on you must be patients they that weigh upon the Lord foreign foreign don't be in a hurry waiting watch your observing listen take the scriptures and if it's not right hold on to it if it's not right tell me so I can get it right amen Brothers there was a difference between David so Hermanos God bless you if you just uh opened your Bibles to first Samuel de Samuel chapter 16. um how many is happy with the Lord hey man he's good amen first Samuel 16. first one says it says and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will it thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected to him from reigning over Israel fill thine horn with oil and go I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sons so then Samuel said how can I go if Saul hear it he will kill me and the Lord said take and heifer with thee and say I am come to sacrifice to the Lord is and then we'll jump to verse 13. it says since then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David and from that day forward so Samuel Rose and went to Rama is I was looking up the word Rama and it means a height you know so uh after the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David he took him to higher places amen amen you see when God does something uh you know he doesn't um I believe that he's a God that uh doesn't reveal himself to everybody not everybody not everybody's uh God's not going to reveal himself to everybody amen amen and when he does certain things he likes to do them in secret amen amen I believe that with all my heart you know the day that um that Samuel or that David was anointed uh you know uh the Lord obviously he uh he was dealing with Samuel the prophet yes because that's how God deals with uh with the people he deals with them through prophets amen when God when God wants his secret to be revealed the Bible says he Reveals His Secret To His prophets amen so he started dealing with his Prophet because his Prophet uh was uh was fearful he was scared of what Saul was going to do if he found out that Samuel was going for another king amen amen so he uh he does a secret you would say a secret anointing Anton says it wasn't publicly equal but it was something private you know I think we're living in a time where everybody wants things to be public that wants to do things he wants to do things in secret you see we got it you know this is a youth service you know and uh no look around everybody wants you know everybody wants to know who they like dogs you want everybody to know who you like you want everybody know you know that so so likes me that's not a god you see not everybody knows about him not everybody has them because that's the way God that's the way God works you see that's why you can't find gold absolutely everywhere because God love God chooses where he puts it says that God chooses where to put his Secrets God chooses where to put that secret anointing Buenas they're done in secrets and secretary amen amen you know they're not out there you know or you're putting yourself out on social media and everybody knows what you're doing everybody knows where you're going hey you know they just they just show you the highlights they're not showing you the the bad times amen amen see the difference between Saul and David foreign [Applause] you know what weather uh whether the people whether the people respond to my preaching or not I really don't care because I care I care what God wants look at your skin I care about what's pleasing to God I mean please water tawa brother Branham says this is he says now I've always tried to when I come down here but when I'm at home to talk about something not just to be talking or not something that would please the people I've tried to speak about something that would please God and help the people you see for help that we could all no matter what church you belong to import denomination that you could be helped for a closer walk with God and that's a reason of being here it's a closer walk with God you see that's what brother Branham says that's okay know that he wanted he didn't want to please the people now you know we don't preach a gospel of just uh oh that they're just going to tell us what we want to hear because that's not going to help us and just hear all about the good things that that I want to hear about it that's not going to make me better that's not going to make you better that's not the good thing we all have flaws here amen amen foreign I want to read another quote uh from brother Brandon it's in the message here you him he says notice the tutor brought the message to the father and said the child is progressing right or wrong then if it came up now no matter what the outside people had to say about this child not disturbance on the farm had to say he tried to work every way to please the father no matter what the world has to say about you it says work to please God do everything you can to build the kingdom of God you see that's what we got to do you see we gotta please because everybody's gonna have a day you know we're waiting for that day but some of us are waiting for for a day of healing others are waiting for a day where they can overcome their Temptations others are waiting for a day where they meet their wives are meeting their husbands so we're all waiting for a day and that's what the message is that's what the title is up to the message yes I'm waiting for that day I'm waiting for your days Okay so they're gonna be my day you see that's gonna be your day amen amen I'm closing now instead but you haven't prepared for the day I believe David David on Earth we woke up one day David woke up one day and uh it was probably he would have never thought he would have never thought that that was gonna be his day but you see the thing of it is we get desperate like they said real desperate sometimes especially the youth is desperate you know you're trying to rush everything young boys think all the girls are gonna just they're just gonna disappear Padre want to take care of them as best I can I'm gonna be anointed king one day but I'm waiting for the day I'm gonna throw out the trash would it fall out there I'm gonna pick up the trash I'm gonna stop talking to the girl stop talking to the boys [Music] [Music] are getting ready for the day [Applause] [Music] though [Music] and David had
