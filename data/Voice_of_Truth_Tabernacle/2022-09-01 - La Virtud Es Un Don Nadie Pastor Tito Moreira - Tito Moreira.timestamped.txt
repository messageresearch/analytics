[17:20] it's a privilege to be in the house of
[17:22] the lord
[17:23] god bless you
[17:26] bless everyone that's watching through
[17:27] the internet
[17:56] after jesus christ
[18:11] or the growth of a christian
[18:14] and that is virtue
[18:17] and uh
[18:18] we'll be speaking on verse 9.
[18:27] i know thy works and tribulation and
[18:29] poverty but that are rich
[18:35] i want to focus on that part i want to
[18:36] focus on this as well
[18:45] and i know the blasphemy of them which
[18:47] say they are jews and are not but are
[18:49] the synagogue of satan
[18:53] and as the title
[19:30] and know that that you are the one that
[19:32] is worth it
[19:35] the father we put ourselves in your
[19:36] heart
[21:14] the smearing church age went through
[21:19] but i i like this verse
[21:24] especially what the second part says
[21:33] and i know the blasphemy of them which
[21:34] say they are jews and are not but are
[21:36] the synagogue of satan
[21:39] we spoke on this verse previously
[21:42] okay
[21:54] the attention that there were people
[22:20] [Applause]
[22:26] [Applause]
[22:52] [Applause]
[23:20] but the children of
[23:25] [Applause]
[23:34] [Applause]
[24:02] suspect
[24:08] [Applause]
[24:23] [Applause]
[24:31] places
[24:34] because that is the way that gospel is
[24:38] refers to other countries
[24:52] [Applause]
[24:58] [Applause]
[25:19] [Applause]
[25:22] [Music]
[25:25] [Applause]
[25:43] [Applause]
[26:08] how can god bear to look upon his own in
[26:11] a time of need and not just stop at all
[26:17] just give it and lavish every everything
[26:20] material upon them
[26:22] to
[26:27] why don't you give them everything
[26:29] instead of taking everything from them
[26:32] this is here's where
[27:31] father knows the things you have need of
[27:33] el el quembiste
[27:36] del campo
[27:38] menta a los pajarillos
[27:41] para ustedes he will close the lily and
[27:44] feeds the sparrow shall do much more for
[27:45] you
[27:46] established
[28:13] but god addresses the lily
[28:28] these physical things are not the true
[28:30] basic necessities of your life
[28:35] for a man's life consistently not of the
[28:36] things he
[28:43] but possesses sneaky first the kingdom
[28:44] of god and his righteousness and all
[28:46] material necessities will be added unto
[28:48] you el puedo noise del pensar material
[28:50] the people of god are not material
[28:52] minded
[28:54] they are christ's mind
[29:21] uh
[29:32] age is one of the vast wealth where
[29:33] often the criterion of spirituality is
[29:35] an abundance of earthly goods
[29:40] in other words they think that the more
[29:42] they have the more spiritual they are
[29:45] spiritually churches the more they have
[29:47] the more spiritual
[29:49] the
[29:50] greater the buildings
[30:07] goods
[30:09] but how poor in spirits
[30:20] for yours is the
[33:08] maybe god
[33:10] [Applause]
[33:36] he lets it
[34:02] is
[34:13] is
[34:28] is of god
[34:30] [Music]
[34:52] and if he allows us to use something
[34:56] estelle
[34:57] is his espana it's for him
[35:00] it's because
[35:15] let it all go
[35:19] because i'm a nobody
[35:21] i want you to see
[35:25] santiago do cinco uh james two verse
[35:28] five says
[35:46] and heirs of the kingdom which has
[35:47] promised to them that love him
[35:54] now that doesn't mean
[36:10] that's difficult
[37:04] if we take that voice or that that
[37:06] scripture literally would be like well
[37:08] god only chose the poor lament
[37:12] only if i'm poor is when god will choose
[37:14] me or elect me
[37:17] but it all depends
[37:29] that's why it says blessed the
[37:31] the poor in spirit
[37:34] the one that is
[38:02] anything
[38:04] we think we have it all
[38:06] that's right
[38:08] we don't come needy many times
[38:11] we say oh i've heard it
[38:13] i know it all
[38:16] that's why we receive nothing
[38:40] [Applause]
[38:58] that acknowledges our need
[39:03] the more you acknowledge your need
[39:05] the more poor you are
[39:08] i can't take there are people
[39:18] that depend too much on themselves
[39:23] watch what the apostle paul says
[39:26] ii corinthians 6 3.
[39:35] giving no offense in anything that the
[39:37] ministry be not blamed
[40:00] but in all things of proving ourselves
[40:01] as the ministers of god in much patience
[40:03] in afflictions in necessities and
[40:05] distresses and assault is incarcerated
[40:07] in
[40:14] imprisonments in tumults and labors and
[40:17] watchings and fastings
[40:25] by pureness by knowledge by long
[40:26] suffering by kindness by the holy ghost
[40:28] by love unfeigned
[40:35] by the word of truth by the power of god
[40:37] by the armor of righteousness on the
[40:38] right hand and on the left
[40:45] by honor and dishonor by evil report and
[40:47] good reports
[40:50] as deceivers
[41:04] but you know what
[41:18] so that they would
[41:44] [Applause]
[42:31] [Music]
[42:57] [Applause]

[43:16] [Music]
[43:20] god owes us nothing
[44:18] [Applause]
[44:48] we are so unhappy
[44:51] because we think we're somebody
[44:55] that's why we're so wretched
[44:58] my husband should treat me this way
[45:01] my wife should treat me this way where
[45:04] we're nobody
[45:13] come on brothers
[45:15] that's why we're so unhappy
[46:40] is
[46:48] it's just because he loves us
[46:52] [Music]
[47:14] [Music]
[47:28] as dying and behold we live as chastened
[47:31] and not killed

[51:38] we know the pastor
[51:40] and where'd the pastor win
[51:46] we know that the sister cut her hair
[51:52] and we see them entering in places where
[51:54] they shouldn't be
[51:58] yes or yes brothers
[52:01] that's the problem with us
[52:15] this is the reason god doesn't use us
[52:18] we're too rich
[52:21] he can't use us like that
[52:24] we think we're somebody
