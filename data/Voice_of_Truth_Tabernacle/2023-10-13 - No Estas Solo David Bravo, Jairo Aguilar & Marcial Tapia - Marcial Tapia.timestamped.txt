[26:16] Christ amen
[26:18] amen I would like to thank uh
[26:22] God and my pastor
[26:24] Tito for the opportunity to be here
[26:29] and for his
[26:32] trust tonight as a youth
[26:39] service oh you may be
[26:43] seated we're going to be speaking on
[26:45] Daniel
[26:47] tonight as they preached a few weeks
[26:52] ago they they preached a few weeks ago
[26:55] that Daniel did not defile himself with
[26:57] the things of the king's
[27:01] [Music]
[27:05] doing and it was preached to us that
[27:09] that because of
[27:12] that that Daniel was
[27:16] blessed and I want to take that
[27:20] thought and bring it to chapter two
[27:26] now and we're going to be reading Daniel
[27:29] chapter 2 verse
[27:34] 1-3 and in the second year of the reign
[27:36] of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed
[27:38] the dreams wherewith his Spirit was
[27:40] troubled and his sleep break from
[27:52] him then the king commanded to call The
[27:54] Magicians and the astrologers and the
[27:56] sorcerers and the C alans for to show
[27:59] the king his dreams and they came and
[28:01] stood before the
[28:10] king and the King said unto them I have
[28:13] dreamed a dream and my spirit was
[28:14] troubled to know the
[28:20] dream so the King
[28:24] Nebuchadnezzar he had this
[28:26] dream and when he he was troubled by
[28:29] this
[28:31] dream so he called his calans and his
[28:33] Sorcerers and his wise
[28:38] men but by the time they got
[28:41] there he already forgot the
[28:44] dream so he told his Sorcerers and his
[28:47] wise
[28:50] men tell me the dream and the
[28:52] interpretation of
[28:55] it and these C and these wise
[29:00] men they did not know the
[29:04] dream they told him that no man could do
[29:08] it and because of this his King was very
[29:12] Furious and he made a decree to kill all
[29:15] the wise men of the
[29:18] land and Daniel was included in
[29:23] there
[29:25] and and this King
[29:28] is kind of like enemy our
[29:31] enemy because he wants to kill
[29:34] us the devil's always going to try to
[29:37] find something to to destroy
[29:40] us especially his
[29:43] children especially those that do not
[29:45] defile themselves with the
[29:48] world those that do Godly
[29:54] things I'm going be reading Daniel
[29:56] chapter 2 17-
[30:05] 19 then Daniel went to his house and
[30:08] made the thing known to hananiah mishel
[30:10] and and Azariah his
[30:18] companions that they would desire
[30:20] mercies of the god of Heaven concerning
[30:21] the secret that Daniel and his followers
[30:23] would not perish with the rest of the
[30:25] wise men of
[30:26] Babylon
[30:35] Bon then was the secret raled unto
[30:38] Daniel in a night vision then Daniel
[30:40] blessed the god of
[30:47] heaven so the king had ordered his men
[30:49] to go kill the wise men of
[30:55] Babylon Daniel and his companions
[30:59] included so what Daniel did is something
[31:02] that a lot of us don't
[31:07] do he went to his house and asked his
[31:09] friends to pray with
[31:13] him so that God may have mercy upon
[31:18] them he was going to
[31:21] God with his
[31:24] problems so he may get any Mercy from
[31:29] him and that's something we don't do a
[31:31] lot of
[31:33] times we like to solve everything on our
[31:37] own we think we're
[31:39] enough we think we're
[31:42] enough we think we don't need God's
[31:46] help and we think we don't need anybody
[31:48] else's
[31:50] help but the Bible says in James
[31:56] 5:116 that we should pray one for the
[32:00] other we should be asking for
[32:02] prayer we should be asking
[32:06] for because that's what's going to help
[32:08] us in the
[32:10] end because God knows all
[32:13] things he wants the best for
[32:18] us now Daniel went to his friends and
[32:20] asked for prayer
[32:24] right and the vision came to him
[32:28] and this Vision was the King's
[32:32] dream and then Daniel gave worship and
[32:37] worship to
[32:39] God that's also a lot of things we don't
[32:43] do God has done so many things for
[32:47] us and we can't even say thank
[32:50] you we can't even thank him for whatever
[32:52] he's
[32:54] done just breathing is his Mercy
[33:02] and he blessed the god of
[33:05] heaven and later
[33:10] on Daniel showed the king the dream and
[33:14] the interpretation of
[33:18] it and we'll be reading Daniel
[33:25] 246 then the king
[33:27] Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and
[33:29] worshiped Daniel and commanded that they
[33:31] should offer an oblation and sweet odors
[33:33] unto
[33:41] him the king answered unto Daniel and
[33:44] said of a truth it is that your God is a
[33:46] god of gods and Lord of kings and
[33:48] revealer of Secrets seest thou couldest
[33:50] couldest revealed this
[33:55] Secret
[34:04] then the king made Daniel a great man
[34:05] and gave him many great gifts and made
[34:08] him ruler over the whole province of
[34:09] Babylon and chief of the governors over
[34:11] the wise men of Babylon
[34:23] and so when Daniel went to God
[34:26] [Music]
[34:28] God gave him the answer to his
[34:32] problems and this solution solved that
[34:36] problem but it didn't only solve the
[34:40] problem God blessed him as
[34:43] well Daniel asked for a solution to his
[34:47] problem and God gave him
[34:51] more and I would like to read the
[34:54] handwriting on the wall 56
[35:01] notice in there God has a servant down
[35:03] there by the name of Daniel a young
[35:04] Prophet about 40 years old who was
[35:06] serving the Lord with all his heart and
[35:08] God had a work for him to
[35:22] do notice in there God had a servant
[35:25] down there by the name Daniel a young
[35:27] Prophet about 40 years old who was
[35:29] serving the Lord with all his hearts and
[35:31] God had a work for him to
[35:42] do and in the carrying away of Babylon
[35:45] remember if God has a work for you to do
[35:47] all the demons out of Torment can't take
[35:49] you they just can't store to you in any
[35:51] way God's got a purpose for the Holy
[35:53] Ghost Church and all the Devils of Hell
[35:56] will never be able to take it any away
[35:59] God's got a purpose for it and will
[36:00] never be destroyed until God lets the
[36:02] Fulfillment of that purpose and he has
[36:04] ordained it to do and it
[36:25] will
[36:34] and remember as Daniel went to the
[36:35] Hebrew children down in there I want you
[36:37] to notice many of them already Wordly
[36:38] minded many of them didn't care well
[36:41] they just go to the tide of the least
[36:42] resistance and isn't that just about a
[36:44] picture of our country
[36:55] today
[37:05] so if God has given you a
[37:07] purpose the devil can't do anything to
[37:10] hinder
[37:12] you because God ordained that
[37:15] purpose he can set
[37:17] Temptation he can send
[37:20] temptation but God's got a way
[37:23] out because he won't give you more
[37:25] Temptation than you will you can
[37:27] [Music]
[37:31] and it keeps on
[37:32] saying oh God give us more men like
[37:37] Daniel give us Christians like Shadrach
[37:39] mesach and
[37:42] Abednego or willing to
[37:45] sacrifice or forfeit every right that
[37:47] they have to become a servant of the
[37:53] lord we have to sacrifice ourselves
[37:55] youth
[37:58] we have to stand up for the word of
[38:01] God look at the Times we're living in
[38:03] right
[38:05] now we can't sit around on the benches
[38:07] doing nothing
[38:09] anymore the end times are here the end
[38:13] times are
[38:15] here Babylon was a time like our
[38:19] time full of
[38:24] sin keeps on saying Daniel and alien
[38:26] away from home way down but watch what
[38:28] he did he purposed in his heart that he
[38:30] wouldn't defile himself with the king's
[38:31] doings down there all the king's fancy
[38:33] foods and all the dainties and that he
[38:35] was eat upon his wine Liquors and that
[38:37] he purposed in his heart while he was an
[38:39] alien he keep himself for God
[38:55] Amen
[39:02] amen now listen
[39:04] youth listen to what I'm about to
[39:07] say there you
[39:09] are though the world forsake
[39:13] you yeah everybody laughs at
[39:16] you calls you every fanatical
[39:19] name that could be
[39:21] called purpose in your heart to do which
[39:23] is
[39:25] right
[39:27] purpose in your heart that you'll do
[39:28] nothing to do with the
[39:31] world living the Shadows of the coming
[39:33] of the
[39:37] lord we can't sit still anymore
[39:40] youth we can't run away from God
[39:43] anymore we're the Next Generation up and
[39:49] coming if God doesn't
[39:51] come before our ministers are getting
[39:55] old
[39:58] then it's our
[39:59] turn I know that scares
[40:02] you because that scares
[40:05] me but don't
[40:07] worry because we are predestinated for
[40:10] this
[40:11] time we were built for this
[40:14] age it's time to stand up to the
[40:19] devil we can't run away from God

[40:25] him May full of sin and
[40:29] trouble but he's going to help us
[40:31] out he has the
[40:33] solution he is the
[40:41] solution we reading and the and thy seed
[40:44] shall possess the Gate of his
[40:48] enemy PR
[40:51] 62 the Hebrew children after they had
[40:54] stood the test whether they would stay
[40:56] for the The Word of Promise or not they
[40:57] were put to a trial and what do they do
[41:00] they possessed the Gate of the enemy
[41:01] amen why they sit on the word stay with
[41:04] the word that voice of God that speaks
[41:06] to
[41:25] you
[41:28] youth we have to keep with the
[41:31] word I know it's hard to read the word
[41:35] sometimes I'll admit I don't really do
[41:37] it that
[41:40] often but when I
[41:42] do it's the times where I find out what
[41:44] I need to
[41:47] do and sometimes we may feel
[41:52] alone because we don't do like the rest
[41:54] of the world does
[41:57] because we don't defy ourselves with
[42:00] them but that's all
[42:02] right like Brother D like brother
[42:05] brandom
[42:06] said Daniel was an alien down
[42:10] there with all the other people in
[42:14] Babylon but that didn't stop
[42:17] him he purposed in his heart to not
[42:19] defile
[42:20] himself and we should do the
[42:23] same we shouldn't be out there
[42:25] prostituting ourselves to
[42:28] we should be
[42:29] here worshiping him because that's our
[42:34] purpose to serve it with all our
[42:40] heart I'll be closing with
[42:44] this uh Expectations by Brother Bron PR
[42:51] 51 Daniel when they told him they was
[42:54] going to throw him in the Lion's Den he
[42:55] was expecting God to be
[43:03] there he believed that he lived right
[43:05] before
[43:09] God and he had a
[43:11] right and every day he raised the
[43:17] shades if there was any way in them
[43:21] days towards the temple and looked
[43:24] towards the Holy Temple and prayed
[43:29] because he believed that there was a
[43:30] burning sacrifice at the altar that the
[43:32] hour at the that hour at the
[43:39] temple and he believed that God heard
[43:41] his prayer because there was no was an
[43:43] innocent substitute died in his place
[43:46] making an anoint
[43:54] atonement and when God went went into
[43:56] the lion's den and when he went into the
[43:58] D L Li
[44:02] Den he did not fear the
[44:05] Lions because he was expecting God to
[44:07] deliver
[44:09] him amen amen let's run to God
[44:14] brothers because he's going to be the
[44:16] one who delivers
[44:18] us and remember
[44:20] youth we're not
[44:22] alone he's always going to be by our
[44:25] side
[44:26] even though we're down in
[44:28] sin he's the one who Rises us
[44:31] up God bless
[44:42] you God bless
[44:47] you it's wonderful to see how God never
[44:49] leaves
[44:54] us and this night we've tled are
[44:56] preaching You Are Not Alone how many
[44:58] believe you're not
[45:00] alone he is in our
[45:03] midst he's always with us
[45:08] amen imagine everything Daniel went
[45:10] through and taking care of
[45:15] himself and that's only with the blood
[45:17] of the
[45:20] sacrifices and now that we have the
[45:22] blood of the perfect
[45:24] sacrifice how much much more can it do
[45:26] for us even
[45:29] more you can open your Bibles in Daniel
[45:32] chapter
[45:36] 3 we'll be reading Daniel chapter 3
[45:40] verse
[45:46] 1-7 while you look for I want to give
[45:49] thanks our Titus for giving me the
[45:50] opportunity to speak
[45:54] here
[45:56] and it says Daniel 3 ver
[46:11] onear the king made an image of gold
[46:13] whose height was three score cubits and
[46:15] the breadth thereof six cubits he set it
[46:19] up in the pl of dura in the province of
[46:24] Babylon
[46:42] then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to
[46:44] gather together the princes the
[46:45] governors the captains the judges the
[46:47] treasurers the counselors the sheriffs
[46:48] and all the rulers of the provinces to
[46:50] come to the dedication of the image of
[46:52] Nebuchadnezzar the the king had set up
[47:06] then and Herald cried aloud to you it is
[47:09] commanded all people Nations and
[47:24] languages
[47:29] that at what time ye hear the sound of
[47:31] the cornate flute harp sacka Suter
[47:33] dolmer and all kinds of music ye Fall
[47:36] Down and Worship the golden image that
[47:38] Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set
[47:46] up and who so fth not down and worship
[47:50] shall the same hour be cast into the
[47:52] midst of a burning fiery
[47:54] furnace
[48:12] therefore at that time when all the
[48:13] people heard the sound of the Cornet
[48:15] flute harp sacka Sultry and all kinds of
[48:18] music all the people all the nations and
[48:20] the languages fell down and worshiped
[48:23] the golden image Nebuchadnezzar the king
[48:25] had set
[48:33] up and this evening I'd like to share
[48:35] the experience these three Hebrew men
[48:37] had in the fury fness for standing up
[48:39] for God's
[48:41] word they had already made a
[48:44] decision to stand for God's
[48:49] word not mattering the circumstance what
[48:51] they were going
[48:52] through not mattering anything
[48:56] their decision was to accept
[48:59] God it didn't matter if God
[49:03] answered at the hour when they would put
[49:05] them in the fiery
[49:08] furnace in chapter one of
[49:12] Daniel uh the king is is uh bothered or
[49:16] troubled by his
[49:19] dream and in chapter two his dream is
[49:21] revealed by
[49:23] Daniel and in chapter three
[49:28] the dream is manifested we can
[49:32] say brother Brom says the
[49:36] statue image of
[49:40] [Music]
[49:42] Daniel because in chapter two he was the
[49:45] only one that could reveal that
[49:47] dream they made it they made him a god
[49:50] they changed his name to
[49:53] Bazar amen
[49:56] because they thought him a
[49:59] God because the king's people could not
[50:02] reveal
[50:08] it now I'd like to play out this story
[50:10] of the Three Hebrew
[50:13] [Music]
[50:17] children I imagine them three there that
[50:19] did not want to kneel to this
[50:22] statue they said we cannot bow
[50:27] because
[50:29] God God is the only one that we can
[50:33] worship and they would not bow to any
[50:35] other
[50:39] God so they were willing in their heart
[50:42] not to do
[50:43] that they decided to
[50:48] fight you will always have a battle
[50:50] before having the
[50:52] Victory and when they
[50:54] decided
[51:17] the
[51:18] consequence brought
[51:22] them to not accept and kneeling
[51:27] the consequence was to go to the fiery
[51:29] furnace
[51:33] amen the decree was to toss them in the
[51:37] furnace for not bowing
[51:40] down before this
[51:43] statue but God never leaves you
[51:46] alone God was watching
[51:50] them they
[51:53] thought Shadrach and ab AG
[51:56] go that or the night
[51:59] before were in a prayer service says
[52:02] brother Brandon
[52:04] praying for that coming trial
[52:08] amen and they had to
[52:11] prove that God hasn't
[52:14] changed that God continued there with
[52:17] them not mattering the
[52:19] situation they
[52:21] decided not to to not surrender decided
[52:25] to fight that battle
[52:32] amen so it says they were cast into the
[52:35] fiery
[52:37] furnace I imagine when they were going
[52:39] to throw them in
[52:41] there they he it up the oven the furnace
[52:45] seven times hotter than it
[52:48] is even the ones that threw them in the
[52:51] in the furnace says that they
[52:52] died with the the vapor
[52:57] or the heat
[52:59] waves I can imagine kingar sitting next
[53:02] to
[53:03] the watching them when they would
[53:08] perish watching if their God would
[53:10] deliver
[53:13] them but God was also working
[53:16] there because God never leaves his
[53:20] children when something is happening on
[53:23] Earth something is happening in heaven
[53:29] when they were walking towards the fire
[53:33] furnace God was in heaven SE seated
[53:36] watching
[53:38] them he was in his throne with his
[53:42] angels when Gabriel got
[53:45] close and said oh
[53:49] Lord have you considered thy servants
[53:51] thy
[53:54] children
[53:55] they are there standing for your
[53:58] word they have trusted in
[54:01] you let me
[54:03] go and change the
[54:06] scene annihilate
[54:08] everyone and he said
[54:12] Gabriel since I formed
[54:14] you you have been faithful and obeyed
[54:18] me you have done everything I've
[54:22] asked but I cannot let you go
[54:25] he didn't let him
[54:33] go a HHO showed
[54:36] up a hanho was
[54:39] there and he said
[54:43] Lord when Noah was on the
[54:48] earth you gave me permission to flood
[54:50] the
[54:53] Earth give me permission to flood
[54:57] Babylon and save your
[55:00] children and if there is a
[55:03] God but he said but he
[55:06] said I can't let you
[55:11] go then he said why
[55:14] Lord because they're my
[55:16] children I need to go myself
[55:20] amen he will never leave us
[55:23] alone he needs to be
[55:27] there we can say like Joshua said I will
[55:31] not leave
[55:32] you be be strong and
[55:37] courageous if God would tell me that
[55:40] word I wouldn't be afraid to
[55:43] continue but he has given a
[55:46] promise that he will be with us
[55:50] amen so he's given that promise to us as
[55:53] well to trust in him
[55:57] so when they were
[55:59] about at the last
[56:03] step they went to the
[56:05] furnace
[56:07] but one waiting for them
[56:10] there and they never
[56:14] burned or they didn't even smell like
[56:19] smoke because God was in their
[56:22] midst God will never leave you alone
[56:25] in the middle of the trial he will be
[56:28] there if you are fighting be
[56:32] joyful because God is with you if you're
[56:36] fighting because God hasn't left you
[56:40] theil to convince you but God hasn't
[56:44] left you God is with
[56:48] you doesn't matter what you
[56:50] need if you decided to follow
[56:53] Christ
[56:55] God is willing to give you everything
[56:57] doesn't matter what it is God will be
[57:00] with you just like the Hebrew children
[57:05] amen the situation W matter they
[57:09] said brother Brom
[57:11] says that they said
[57:14] no not
[57:16] carrying that's the decision we
[57:19] must to tell the world no put a stop and
[57:26] no it's that
[57:30] decision but it's not the decision that
[57:32] we say
[57:33] yes we say yes here in
[57:37] church and when we leave we're thinking
[57:39] something
[57:41] different if we make a
[57:44] decision you need to support that
[57:47] because
[57:48] God God will support his word amen he
[57:53] said that he be with us till the end of
[57:55] the world Amen not
[57:58] mattering he will be with
[58:01] you as he was with the Hebrew
[58:06] children God was with
[58:09] them King
[58:11] Nebuchadnezzar was
[58:13] there and went to
[58:16] see because now he saw there was
[58:20] four and he
[58:22] asked did you not put three
[58:26] three they said we
[58:30] did so he was amaz and said there's
[58:33] another one and he looked like the Son
[58:36] of God he said God will never leave you
[58:38] alone God was there with them
[58:42] amen because God supports his word they
[58:46] had stood for God and God will stand for
[58:50] if you stand for God God will stand for
[58:52] you amen he will be with you amen
[58:57] amen that's everything brother God bless
[58:59] you brother
[59:12] Marshall God bless you
[59:18] brother let's open our Bibles to
[59:21] John John 14
[59:27] chapter one or verse
[59:31] one John Chapter 14 verse
[59:35] one it
[59:44] reads let not your heart be troubled ye
[59:46] believe in God believe also in
[59:52] me and in Jeremiah 2
[59:58] verse
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:18] reads and I will give them in heart to
[1:00:20] know me that I am the Lord and they
[1:00:22] shall be my people and I will be their
[1:00:25] God for they shall return unto me with
[1:00:27] their whole
[1:00:35] heart may God help us this
[1:00:38] evening for
[1:00:40] title we'
[1:00:43] titled You are not
[1:00:46] alone and I believe with all my
[1:00:49] heart that we are not
[1:00:53] alone although things
[1:00:55] things seem difficult in our
[1:00:57] lives God allows them with a
[1:01:01] purpose if there's one thing that I
[1:01:04] know that God has never left
[1:01:07] me and if God hasn't left
[1:01:10] this I believe with all my
[1:01:13] heart has never left you also I don't
[1:01:16] know
[1:01:17] brother but I
[1:01:21] Rejoice I rejoice in my tribulations and
[1:01:24] in
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:27] problems because that's when God gives
[1:01:29] me the
[1:01:30] most that's when God
[1:01:33] gives that's when he proves himself more
[1:01:36] to my life and he reminds me and he
[1:01:39] tells me son you are not alone I haven't
[1:01:44] left
[1:01:47] you you can maybe do anything on this
[1:01:50] Earth can leave to the world if you
[1:01:53] want
[1:01:55] you can wear whatever you
[1:01:57] want you can act however you
[1:02:00] want but God will always be with you God
[1:02:04] has never left you will never leave you
[1:02:07] sons of
[1:02:08] God I just remind you that you're not
[1:02:12] alone Amen
[1:02:16] brother now we're speaking on
[1:02:19] Daniel this scripture I read in
[1:02:23] Jeremiah I'm going to read this quote
[1:02:25] from Brother
[1:02:27] brandham a man running from the presence
[1:02:29] of God
[1:02:30] God preached
[1:02:34] 1965 we find out
[1:02:40] father that what we need is to
[1:02:45] understand because if we don't know what
[1:02:47] we're doing
[1:02:50] then how do we know how to do it
[1:02:56] but we should have understanding as
[1:02:58] Daniel
[1:03:00] said that had
[1:03:05] understanding by the writings of the
[1:03:07] Prophet
[1:03:13] Jeremiah and father we have
[1:03:15] understanding by the writings of the
[1:03:16] holy
[1:03:19] spirit that he reveals to us in this
[1:03:23] hour
[1:03:26] give us Lord the desires we have for
[1:03:29] you brother Bram is saying
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:32] herei that
[1:03:34] Daniel
[1:03:36] understood the
[1:03:39] scriptures from
[1:03:41] Jeremiah he
[1:03:44] understood what was going to
[1:03:46] happen for him to be
[1:03:48] in was not a coincidence he
[1:03:52] knew that would happen
[1:03:54] children of
[1:03:59] God
[1:04:02] go will
[1:04:04] be you should know
[1:04:06] one is with
[1:04:08] you God will never leave
[1:04:12] you doesn't matter if you don't feel it
[1:04:15] or if you
[1:04:16] do God is with
[1:04:18] you God
[1:04:20] promised to be with
[1:04:23] you
[1:04:29] now I don't stand up
[1:04:31] here to just give you a show I stand
[1:04:37] here as a
[1:04:40] testimony that through
[1:04:44] tribulations that's when God reveals in
[1:04:46] my
[1:04:47] life through what you're going
[1:04:50] through God promised to reveal to you
[1:04:54] come on children of
[1:05:01] God because the scripture we
[1:05:04] read the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:07] speaking says let your hearts not be
[1:05:10] trouble what does that
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:15] mean that when the problems and
[1:05:18] tribulations our hearts are
[1:05:23] troubled our
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:27] hearts goes through a phase of fear of
[1:05:34] insecurity and everyone goes through
[1:05:37] that any bad
[1:05:39] news that we
[1:05:42] listen and more if it's a
[1:05:49] beloved we're going to be a little
[1:05:51] uneasy a
[1:05:53] little our hearts will be
[1:05:55] troubled yes
[1:05:58] Brethren if someone walked
[1:06:00] in through these doors
[1:06:04] screaming that someone isn't feeling
[1:06:06] well back there or that they fainted or
[1:06:09] or
[1:06:11] died our hearts are going to be
[1:06:14] troubled by the news yes
[1:06:19] Brethren because every human goes
[1:06:22] through
[1:06:23] that Les
[1:06:25] brother if we do stay still as the
[1:06:28] scripture says be
[1:06:31] still that I am
[1:06:34] God see God in the
[1:06:37] scene if we St still with his
[1:06:40] word we can
[1:06:42] see we would
[1:06:44] see God's
[1:06:46] wonders in our lives amen
[1:06:50] amen but what
[1:06:53] happens
[1:06:54] the devil has a subtle
[1:06:56] way of getting in our
[1:07:00] mind to our heart and trouble
[1:07:03] you by using
[1:07:06] insecurity but if
[1:07:08] we would
[1:07:12] understand that we will go through
[1:07:16] trials no longer is
[1:07:19] in you will
[1:07:22] knowed on this
[1:07:24] Ser but also
[1:07:27] also you will know
[1:07:29] now which God you're
[1:07:33] serving these three Hebrew
[1:07:35] men they

[1:07:39] going it wasn't something new where
[1:07:42] they're taking were they going to do
[1:07:45] they
[1:07:46] knew they were
[1:07:49] preparing and they would put them in
[1:07:52] there up
[1:07:55] seven but they were not afraid of that
[1:07:58] because they
[1:07:59] knew their trust was in God Son of

[1:08:06] presence there's nothing on this plan
[1:08:09] that can move you

[1:11:55] brother why is it hard to believe
[1:12:09] that I've
[1:12:12] purposed myself to finish on
[1:12:17] time because I've
[1:12:19] understood and
[1:12:22] understanding
[1:12:24] the
[1:12:25] importance about
[1:12:28] time and I'll express it

[1:12:50] past but
[1:12:52] look
[1:12:55] we should have
[1:12:57] understanding
[1:12:59] look one of the things that I found
[1:13:03] out why I
[1:13:06] struggle is because I don't understand
[1:13:08] where I get
[1:13:10] in I just make decisions
[1:13:13] lightly and when I'm in in
[1:13:16] it I look at
[1:13:20] reality and I'm
[1:13:22] suffering
[1:13:24] so understand
[1:13:26] youth understand where you're getting

[1:14:02] yes so then you are willing and he said
[1:14:05] yes I am
[1:14:09] willing he was willing with
[1:14:12] understanding understanding where he was
[1:14:14] getting into that's how Daniel was
[1:14:17] that's how the three Hebrew men
[1:14:19] were that's how every Son of God
[1:14:22] is

[1:40:52] his he did not have to hide from
[1:40:59] anyone we want to hide that we're

[1:41:08] Christian we need
[1:41:13] men that seek the correct what's
[1:41:17] correct that they want the correct
[1:41:21] I want when there when there's young
[1:41:22] people I I believe when there's
[1:41:25] youth when there is youth
[1:41:31] men when they're seeking a young
[1:41:35] girl not someone that looks like the
[1:41:38] world but they're looking for a
[1:41:41] lady I believe that that the ladies are
[1:41:44] going to fix
[1:41:45] themselves that they
[1:41:48] realize that they realize what the
[1:41:52] that they're looking for daughters of
[1:41:55] God a man should be so
[1:42:00] clear a young
[1:42:05] man I don't want someone that looks like
[1:42:07] the artist of the
[1:42:11] world young men stand up for
[1:42:14] God and stand up for what's
[1:42:17] [Music]
[1:42:18] correct you cannot force anyone
[1:42:22] but you can be an influence for someone
[1:42:25] else if you say I am
[1:42:29] seeking and I believe there's going to
[1:42:32] be that they're going to want to be
[1:42:34] Daughters of God but if
[1:42:37] you you look at
[1:42:45] anything the the women are not going to
[1:42:47] have a desire to be a a young lady uh a
[1:42:51] lady a lady a lady a daughter of
[1:42:55] [Music]
[1:42:57] God I believe it begins with the

[1:44:12] more we should be an example
[1:44:16] fors we should be an example for Fort
[1:44:19] Collins

[1:44:24] of the
[1:44:26] hour God has not given this to every one
[1:44:29] of the message of the
[1:44:30] hour but God has given it to
[1:44:34] us we should be an example for other
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:44] churches I I'm challenging the the youth
[1:44:47] not to be
[1:44:49] scared and I am starting starting with
