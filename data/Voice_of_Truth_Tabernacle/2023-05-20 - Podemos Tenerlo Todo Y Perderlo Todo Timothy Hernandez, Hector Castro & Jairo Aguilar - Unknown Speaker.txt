greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know it's so beautiful to be here tonight I don't think there's any better place where we could be at it youth there's no other better place that we could be out and to be in the house of the Lord you know who says you can't be at home watching YouTube you know we're doing something else but God has you here in this moment and has brought your life up to this moment to where you're at right now everything that you have done in your past has led you to this momento can you just meditate on that person everything that you've done God has brought you up to this momento I would like to thank my pastor for giving me the privilege you know and let's also be praying for our brothers and that are out yeah if we could please open our scriptures in the book of First Kings chapter 3 verse 5 and 9. now we're speaking on Solomon estamos the son of David and the son of Bathsheba is and it says like this Jesse and gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee is verse 6 and Solomon said thou it has shoot unto thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee that thou has kept him for his great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is as it is this day is hijo verse 9 give therefore thy servant Solomon and understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people verse 10 and the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing is we can please bear our heads dear heavenly father Lord thank you for this privilege Lord Celestial gracias I do not feel worthy Lord of standing here we might not understand it but just believe it Lord Senor thank you for this night Lord gracias may you guide my words Lord I put this service in your hands as well as my interpreter and the following preachers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we're speaking on Solomon is Solomon being the son of David and the daughter of Bathsheba um and we see that throughout the book of First Kings chapter one we see that Not only was there Solomon but it was in English sorry Brothers but we see that there's two brothers right here you know once fighting to get the The Throne you know and one is at peace you know one is the name of Solomon is means beloved of the Lord another name that he also has is peaceful and so we see that in the book of First Kings chapter one here's trying to get the throne you know but it wasn't in God's plan for him to get the throne but it was in fact Solomon who was it who was in God's will to get the throne so now if you don't understand a little bit of the story you know we have here two brothers akimiramos Dos Hermanos that are in other words in the process of getting the inheritance of the throne but we see that at the Niger you know he exalts himself you know he does all he does his banquet he does all this stuff you know but the Bible tells us that humble yourselves that we have to Humble ourselves and the Lord says if you do if you said he will lift you up amen in Psalm 75 it says for exhaustion comes neither from the East nor from the West nor from the South but God is the judge he puts down one and exalts another I don't have it in the verse excuse me amen uh go ahead but pretty much saying that God is gonna humble one is you know and King Solomon was one of the wisest men he was one of God even tells him you'll be one of the wisest men savios right and and God give to him with unsurpassed wisdom and um you know how many how many of us you know sometimes we exalt ourselves how many times have we done things to glorify ourselves foreign because that is what matters most significance amen and so along the towards the end of first Kings chapter one um you know Solomon is made King Salomon of Israel but but before Solomon becoming King you know she interceded for her son Solomon Salomon a mother interceding for her child how many mothers are here like that tonight man and so Bathsheba goes on to Solomon and she lets him know what is going on with and so as we go on to chapter two of First Kings um Solomon has adenaya killed salomonas and as well as Davis General joab yes correct because he challenged him you know and I go back to the same thing you have to fulfill your purpose for what God called you foreign and so as we go on to chapter three this is the most beautiful part about Solomon is the fact the words that he spoke to God of what he asked for from God you know Solomon didn't say oh give me money Solomon didn't say oh well make this person my enemy en Amigo no Solomon asked some wisdom and and sometimes Nosotros you know we go into our little prayer you know and we go asking God oh God I don't have money oh Lord help me in this or that Ernesto but why don't we ask the things that would please God Lord let me love my brother more my church more Lord let me be of help to you but no but sometimes we ask God for things that benefit us when in reality we should be asking God for things to help his throne you know and and that's that's and I I personally speaking for myself I think that if God came to me tonight if I was outside in the world and he came onto me and said what would you want well I'd want money well maybe fame maybe women but what about here what would you ask of God forgot to renew you okay for God to give you more of him man that's right and then he says may I that I may discern between good and bad man you know King Solomon he was a way a very wise person and later on in the story we see that Solomon Falls because he fell into things that did not pertain to God you know he fell into women and to the gods of their of his women and that's not what we want tonight we don't want a backslide for things that we don't need I like to read this quote from Brother Branham in the message believe is thou this is he says I believe Solomon had the most level prayer to God that I have ever heard he prayed that God wouldn't make him so rich that he would forget God [Music] and yet not to make him so poor that he wouldn't have to steal is so just the Comforts of of life is what we desires is that right and that's about where the most of us stand I guess and very fortunate and thankful to have that is okay so if I can leave you with one thing tonight is the trust God is thank you to trust them and not not forget about him like Solomon said God bless you brothers and sisters [Applause] for internet pastor is yes glory to God Hermanos foreign foreign Timothy okay we tried all this preaching we can gain and lose everything yes and Gabe and the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee is unto thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in brightness of Harwood thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day is made thy servant King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or come in when he says here I am a little child is here glory to God glory to God here we can see Brethren that God asked told Solomon to ask what he wanted now I ask you a question what would we ask for brother so let's think about it what would we ask for fame yes is that we could ask for many things but if we begin Solomon says that is with 300 concubines glory god is once brethren is a lady I tell you we should always be an expectation because God can speak his name was preaching and that young woman and brother the brother you can ask for a million dollars glory to God if God told me God has asked us that before this is that's not enough we need to teach them Glory God God help us brethren a little more brethren this is from the message yes says you know Faith cometh by hearing okay let me rewind a little brother is finally way down in the uh most parts of the Known World there was a little Queen a heathen and she's called the queen of the South which was and she was away across the deserts to where her country was and everyone passing through would say oh you should be up in Jerusalem up in Palestine for they have a great God up there is Peron in um who has visited them with a great gift and signs and wonders are taking place by one named Solomon whom they have made King this is God's word says because Solomon asked for it God gave him wisdom is us I was resonating worldwide Solomon's wisdom yeah there were many people coming to ask for advice here we're going to get to the Queen of Sheba perumos before this brethren is he says and First Kings 3 16. I'm just going to read it fast says two harlots arrived and they asked them what do you want they said and they said what's going on is that we're living and both of us gave birth and we tried but while we slept while they slept this woman drowned hers the one that was dead every child and took the child that was alive okay so King Solomon said let's see who the real mother is [Music] so what were they going to do Yama [Music] esta she heard of a man with a lot of wisdom but it doesn't say yes yes but then she said what is it or is it not true and so she was willing to go and find out because she said I'm gonna go see with my own eyes there was no vehicles they use camels what I was finding out it was around 1200 because she walked with her and her servants through the desert many times it's hard for us to come 20 minutes she was going to go see Solomon there and God's word said in Luke 11 31 is [Music] then God will speak to us glory to God says she was marvelous of all the wisdom Solomon that she says okay he had more wisdom than what the Queen of Sheba heard of Glorious the Lord of God is really up glory to God I just want to leave you with something as a brother Timothy let's come with an expectation when we come to the house of God because God can speak to us at any time let's not just be watching a person up here let's watch our lord Jesus God bless you brother [Applause] but to see him so read the scripture to stretch a little First Kings 10 . Instagram First Kings 10. first one we'll be reading the name Lord Jesus Christ and when the Queen of Sheba heard the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to approve him with hard questions and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels and bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and Solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hid from the King which he told her not yes and when the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom and the house that he had
