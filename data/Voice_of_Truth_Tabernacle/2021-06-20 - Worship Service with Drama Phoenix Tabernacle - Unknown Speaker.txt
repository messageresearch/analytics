presentation really from the youth from Phoenix if you can get ready for Jesus so they have a skit and I'm going to tell you all about it is that okay yes we'd love to hear it so did you know that back when the Bible was written in the book of Acts the Holy Ghost came down I keep I keep thinking you're going to be my interpreter but you're not oh I'm so sorry it's it's English or what I'm sorry you want me to go straight English or you want an interpreter it's up to you really it's okay it's that okay see I have l in Spanglish it's okay okay I'm going to have in Spanglish okay that sounds great back and the AO fell down with fire and it changed the lives of the AP wow and then the Romans and the other Hebrews the the Pharisees they didn't like that Jesus Christ was being preached no so they would attack the Christians and persecute them so they had to share the gospel in secret can you whisper to your friend and say Jesus loves you say Jesus loves you so that's a secret now turn to the person on the other side and say Jesus died for your sins Jesus died for your sins Jesus died for your sins but the people didn't like it so then they started persecuting the Christians they would get them just like your pastor here and be like no be quiet be quiet don't be preaching about Jesus can you give your a round of applause nice and shiny okay but back then they weren't so very nice no no no no no and that was this one man there was this one man by the name of Paul but God had changed his name cuz before his name was Saul Saul of Tarsus are you ready ready here and you stand over here see the gospel why don't you have a seat talk to you the gospel started by one man his name was [Music] Jesus and Jesus he knew God knew that the world was full of sin and the only way for the world to be saved was if God himself came down and died on a cross so that we can be forgiven for our sins sir that whosoever shall believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life but Saul of Tarsus was a Pharisee and he was offended by the cross and he didn't like the people were worshiping this man called Jesus so he did everything he could to stop it hey that's messed up [Music] dude but he had a decree he had a paper that declared that he could persecute all the Christians so he got his little Soldiers with knives and swords and he went to kill the Christians but God had a different plan because you could kill the messenger but you can never stop this message oh Hallelujah as Saul was on his way he got encountered with the pillar of fire and Jesus Christ himself transformed his life forever and the reason you and I have a gospel was because God used this man to spread his word Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus dwelle the of the godhead bodily he is the image the invisible God our Sabbath our rest the word made flesh Prophet priest and King you the the god Jus he is the image of the invisible God our Sab our rest the made FLH king [Music] sing enl Jesus the pear of great price marriage Feast must so accurate and precise Jesus the seed and the F with hidden treasures your labor Jes and the lamb The Great I Am from the dead he raised exalted and praised he raised forever there will never be another Yeshua ham the way truth and life so Paul he wrote the letters in prison and he passed it to the Ephesian churches Cor Church age to the galatian church to all the different churches and they went out and spread the gospel and one by one they would read it and it came to [Music] life blessed are they who hunger and thirst after rightousness for they shall be fil Jesus said to the world you're shining in the darkness a city on a hill Jesus taught us how to PR Our Father inen be [Music] am way truth and but just like that from generation to generation they would try to stop the word but father would share it with their son mother would share the gospel with their daughter friend would share with their [Music] friend Jesus mle worker to the winds and the waves he said Peace Jesus likeus the the lame and the leers Jesus the daughter of dyus the wiow son of he from the de the lon and the lamb great I Ames forever be another [Music] this was life to the Believers Jesus betrayed with a kiss sented to die by Peter three times T Jesus At The Whipping HS on a theed the Jes it is finished into your hands I commit my Jesus Des H principalities and Lucifer who fell Jesus Takes the and the grave setting captives free releasing the SL Jesus on the third day he up all power in his [Music] just like that it got to a point where the Roman Catholic Church was defeating and capturing and punishing all the Believers you declared to be a Christian they made you prove it oh they would feed them they would feed them to lions and bears they would burn their bodies they would do anything to stop the Original Seed the word of God from being spread from one heart to the other heart but don't worry because one fell and two would rise up they would take out three and then six Christians would rise like the scripture says 1,000 to my right 10,000 to my left but we know that the Living God will sustain us amen right they had something real yes you see this body this isn't real there's something even more real there's something even more real when they had an encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ that life came in their heart and they could face any trial they could face any storm they could face any bully because they knew whatever you say about me here can't stop me because God has the true words of life amen that's right and one day they were going to be with him for all eternity amen that's right but she wasn't quite [Music] convinced deny you Christ deny your faith to this dead Jew you claim to be your king and your savior you you betrayed Rome and the penalty for that is death but I will extend Mercy to you there's one simple thing you have to do and that is kiss this ring just kiss this ring any ters don't be deceived it looks like a candy but it's not what about you deny him live a prosperous life here nor nobody it looks delicious doesn't it Temptation sometimes looks delicious doesn't it this is hard this is hard right here and the devil will come to you and he'll say it's just a little [Music] lick it's just a little Dr wow it's just a little [Music] peek but no it's just a little word no sir it's never just a little anything you give the devil an inch he's going to take a mile but if you give God an inch oh you'll never regret it as long as amen that's right come on no takers then all right any last words no I said any last [Music] words Al omega beginning and the end which was and is is to come Almighty the first the last alive forever more the King of Kings the Lord of lords alega beginning and end Andy [Music] The Great I Am let he exed and PR he forever there will never be another [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can somebody say Jesus Jesus he's alive he's alive Jesus give him another hand of wow profess what do you think way that was incredible W amen wow amen I know they were persecuted and they were followed and they were they they they died for for God for what they believe Jesus died for us and they were willing to live and die for him wait yeah but I mean hear me out here so does that me so I I I don't want to die are are you okay I mean I'm a little freaked out I mean all this anxiety is building up and I mean they had a dying all this but I'm also a sinner but I mean I have all the stuff that's wrong with me but are you okay here yeah I just got a little ler how come you don't tell me you have asthma yeah it runs in the family around the Holy Ghost you better not have asthma but if you because you run out of breath but don't worry God can heal asthma amen so I can see let me see if I understand you correctly uh-huh so you got a little anxious because it is kind of scary know yeah a bit Yeah but did you know that where there is perfect love where there is perfect love there is no fear you accept that perfect love in your heart nothing anybody can do to you that's right can scare you yeah that's why they face death so boldly cuz they were filled with something very special you know what you're right Prof can I give you another example yeah get give me another example I need to use my little son after all it's his father's day chiy Theo can you give him a [Music] hand come come come be careful be careful thank you very much a chy Theo turn around say hi to the people hi chy Theo okay what are they balloons for yes M so I'm going to show you something about your fear about your anxiety if you ever had a nightmare say me if you've ever been really nervous or afraid say me if you've ever screamed like a girl boys please don't say me so listen you see this balloon this balloon represents you this balloon represents M and the air inside represents all the things of the world that you put inside you like the fear the the the nervousness the the thoughts that aren't of God you know all those things what I'm talking about when you talk bad about somebody or when you're jealous because that person has prettier shoes than you or when you're scared so so all that air is just hot air that we feel ourselves with Wow and this fire you see this that's the pressure that's the spirit of fear that comes and tries to destroy you and if you're not filled if you're not filled with the right thing what do you think will happen when this touches the balloon Cho can you hold this please hold it up nice and high just hold it up or else I'm going to fire you not with this fire ooh are you scared but I want you to understand when you have your own understanding come when you're thinking your own thoughts and the fire of persecution comes to you when your mommy and daddy are mean or when your friends are not sharing or when your husband is not respecting you like the woman of the [Music] house or or you you know what I mean you've been working all day mother stay at home mom your husband works his little eight hours and he comes and he chills on the TV and then you still have to come on or what about husbands what about when our wives they disrespect us in front of our friends M what do you mean I have to throw the trash no this fire that's those little annoyances that get on our nerves but if one of those if throwing the trash will make you not act like a Christian come on if having to wash your own dishes will make you not act like a Christian come on if having to pick up your toys or clean your room will make you throw a fit and not act like Jesus is in your heart then what's [Music] wrong that is the fire that gets under your skin and what happens when you're not filled with the right [Applause] thing that's a lot of pressure right so what should I fill myself up with love Jesus but what wait wait wait wait not yet but how do we know what Jesus says the Bible the Bible you see this is the word of God and when you fill yourself up with the water of the word of God then that changes everything there's a chemical reaction that happens inside you and it causes your body to react differently when the fire comes to touch you now this is the word of God that's the water now you see this right here oh this is a balloon that represents you but this time it's not filled with your ideas it's not filled with anything you could make up it's filled with the water of the word of God can you turn around and confirm that in fact this is water she's spanked like a pig thank you sister thank you it is water and when the pressure of Life comes Cho and touches the balloon filled with water what do you think is going to happen well let's see let's put our balloon where our mouth is Pastor okay can you hold this please so we know that the pressures of this world are real brother Tito can you please share with us what's one thing that causes you pressure um wait a minute wait a minute I I count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [Music] 10 okay enough enough said when you're a pastor you don't just have your own problems you have Fidel's problems me you have Tas problems she said me me me me you have Timmy's problem you have Marshall's problems all [Applause] Lord oh my goodness all these little children's problems and when the fire comes see if he's not filling himself up with the word of God why and the pressure comes and you come with your problem [Music] againto like Felix I just prayed for you [Applause] yesterday that's right but you know what God needs people like Felix amen come on I didn't talk to him but when the fire comes if if he's not filled with the word of God I'm not going to do that to him come on you guys but I will do the other [Applause] one but praise be to almighty God that you have a pastor that is consecrated in the word amen that he reads his messages that he honors the Apostle who he called his spiritual fathers that where he got the word from amen so that when the fire comes and brother Alex's car breaks down on the way home from California when the fire comes do [Music] it wow the balloon cannot pop wow and if you don't believe me look where it got black from the flame let me explain to you why you look like your daddy let me explain to you cuz the water the the water it serves as a heat conductor right it conducts the heat so it spreads the heat out evenly so it does doesn't affect the outside now my question for you if literal water can keep a balloon from popping when the Fire Hits what can the water of the Holy Ghost the water of the washing of the word when it's inside a Believer when the Flames of Hell come raging what will it do but protect you from popping what can it do to a Believer who's filling himself up with the water of the word if you can identify can you give the Lord a hand of Praise but why thank you CH can you take it please thank you it's okay you can hold but why why because greater is he that is within me than the fire that's out there in the world greater is he that is within you then he that is in the world wow profess Theo that help me so much I understand so much more now and I believe we all took a lot from this today and we learned so much and remember the scripture also says I have hidden your word in my heart that I may not sin against you so when the fire comes sometimes we just want to just smack somebody sometimes we just want to blow our lid and we don't act like a Christian but we don't want to sin you can be angry the word says but sin not how do I not sin lord well it says I have hidden hidden your word with in me so that my heart in my heart so that I I may not sin against you so repeat after me I have hidden I have hidden your word in my heart your word in my heart so I may not so I may not sin against you sin against you God bless you well thank you everyone give a round of applause to Professor Theo wow amen how many of y'all enjoyed that tonight okay now it's time to go home no I'm just kidding no we still got more to come can I get amen for that and we've learned so much he said I had to write it down I I have hidden your word in my heart so that I may not sin against you wow such a powerful scripture so how many of you have ever gotten mad angry frustrated how many of us ever wanted to throw that towel but just like Professor Theo said if we have that word in our heart we will not sin well how many of you ready for that second Talent today that we have going but before we do that I want to sing a song so do we want to sing with me because Mr Natalie Jesus loves me this I know before the Bible tells me so little ones to him be long they are weak but he is strong sing it with me oh yes Jesus Loves Me Oh yes Jesus Loves Me Oh yes Jesus loves me the Bible tells me so sing it with me and Jesus loves me this I know as he loves so long ago taking children on his KNE saying let them come to me oh and yes Jesus Loves Me Oh yes Jesus Loves Me Oh yes Jesus loves me the Bible tells me can you stand with us and sing that one more time yes yes [Music] Jes when yes Jesus loves me the Bible tells me so how many are thankful to the Lord how many are thankful that we serve a living God a God that can help us take off the pressure a god that is greater inside of us than he that is in the world Amen we serve a living God that will keep us from all oppression right and when the oppression does come we love him so much and he is so real that he can keep us from breaking I don't want to break my word to God I promise that I would love him he is not a covenant breaking God he's made a covenant with us and he will never break it cuz we are a holy people did you know that that we are a holy people if you know that you're a holy people can you say [Music] amen amen see God is good all the time and all the [Music] time praise the Lord can you look at somebody and tell them say God is good God is good tell them all the time all the amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise and then you may be seated you ready amen so talking about a holy people in the Bible there was a holy people and they were called Israel they were the nation of Israel they were God's holy people and you know what God allowed those people to go to Egypt and there in Egypt there was this evil man called pharaoh and he had them prisoners as slaves working to build up Egypt they were oh it was a horrible bondage over here they were building up walls of Egypt over here there were building up statues for pharaoh and they stood up on their feet and they pushed and right here they were making mud so they can make bricks night after night day after day slaving away sometimes we feel like slaves in our job we feel like slaves in our workplace but God has a purpose for everything cuz he told him that there would be a deliverer for 400 years they cried out God deliver me God deliver [Music] me hear their [Music] cry you are might god father of Abraham isacc all is [Music] see [Music] Del Del can you say that say send your deliverer send your deliverer your deliverer but there was a man and a woman who trusted God and they had their children Miriam was their daughter and they had a tiny little baby you see Pharaoh wanted to kill all the babies of the Israelites so he was grabbing the little babies and he was throwing them inside the Nile River be care of it's okay he's my son but he would throw them in the Nile and the crocodiles would snap and snap and eat the babies snap and they would eating all of the children oh like sometimes I feel the education system and social media and the waves of this world are snapping up our children but there is a deliverer and there is a provided way and God anointed this family to grab that little baby and put him inside a box hopefully it was bigger than the tissue box that he's holding but he knew I'm going to put this baby in the river and God Almighty will protect that [Music] childo him you are Creator God you made the galaxies the deepest Seas the gentle breeze in my heart as well you know every Star by it name just the same and you give us the words that we pray protect your deliverer precious deliverer our son the deliverer my baby deliverer be brave oh [Music] deliverer our son the deliverer [Music] I believe soon he [Music] will and Miriam his sister followed the basket in the river she wanted to make sure it was safe I believe [Music] I thees of will never come promise Deliverance don't I believe and the princess of Egypt was there at the Nile and she saw the basket and she picked it up and she saw that there was a little baby in the basket and she thought oh my evil dad phoh would kill this baby but I'm going to protect it God always has a way of escape and Miriam is sister ran to her to let her know you know I have a mom and the mom can feed the baby if you want and the princess agreed so Moses's mom had the privilege of raising the son that she gave up mothers if we would give our children in the hands of the Lord the Lord will let you raise up your child in a Godly stature amen amen amen I shall call him Moses Lord I believe and Moses grew up and he grew up to be a smart man a mighty man he went to school and passed all his classes he did all his homework he went to karate class and he was like ha and he learned how to be a soldier and he was a mighty Soldier until one day he thought you know what I believe God put me in this position to be the deliverer and then he went out to where his people were working and he heard some music in the background because the piano player takes no breaks and he saw that the children were under [Music] oppression help help me and he noticed that they were being mistreated by the Egyptians the people that he was supposed to deliver were being thrown down they were being beaten and they were being tortured and he got angry how many Christians have ever been angry when you see the enemy destroying your brother but Moses he decided I'm angry that's my brother I'm going to beat him up you don't touch my brother but he wanted to take his matters into his own hands but God has a different way poor Moses went up there and say hey you what are you doing to my brother you leave him alone are you okay why you just close your eyes wait a minute what' I do you see that what you do I I I was helping you because he shouldn't be treating you like that you deserve better no wait you deserve better you're a Son of God no no wait why are you looking at me like that it was M hey that's the last time I get your back that was him come here come here wa come here what did I do Pharaoh Pharaoh will kill me and he ran just like a lot of us run when we make a mistake we want to hide when we do something that we shouldn't do and when the fingers get pointed at us it's like but I was trying to help but sometimes the way to hell is paved with good intentions we need to trust God in all that we do poor Moses he ran and for 40 years he was in the wilderness for 40 years he thought he was a failure for 40 years he was getting older and older and he had a stick where's my stick can you get it for me because he went and he ended up being a Shepherd but if you know anything about Egyptians they hate Shepherds Moses was raised as an Egyptian and the shepherd was the lowest job a man can have that's the shepherd stinked a Shepherd didn't have no education yes a Shepherd couldn't really Express himself all he did was stay with the sheep in the field oh and those sheep didn't even tithe he he was a poor Shepherd my mind my mind he was a very very poor Shepherd and he was at the lowest of his lows and he thought Lord I thought I was supposed to be somebody I thought I had a Ministry oh Lord Look at me now I'm all washed up and and that little sheep keeps running away now I have to go get it [Applause] Felix get back over [Music] here oh Lord so Moses went there you go I'm out coming after you brother and as he was on his way to grab that little sheep that kept running away he saw a burning bush and that Burning Bush was God and it spoke to him and he said Moses I am the god of your fathers yes sir I have heard the Cry of my people yes amen I am here and I'm going to send you to go rescue them cuz I've heard their cry oh Children of the Living God you feel like you've been weeping for 40 years you feel like you've been weeping for 50 years you feel like you've been weeping for 400 years almighty God here's you're cry he said Moses I'm sending [Music] you I can't I can't I can't even talk I I got I got I'm sending you but but but I don't have any qualifications I don't call the qualifi I qualify the [Music] call what will I what will I say you tell them that the Great I Am has sent you and you tell that pharaoh to let my people go yes sir and Moses said look you got the wrong guy I mean he said look you're going to go you know what if you don't want to talk your brother Aaron he can talk Aaron will talk for you did you know that God doesn't require you to do it all on your own yes sir that's right you know you think God put something in your heart and you don't think you're qualified if we can let go of our ego and our pride and our desire to get all of the glory he'll provide somebody to help you yes we don't need all the glory brother Tito that's why there's a five-fold Ministry we share the burden Moses you can't talk it's okay I'm going to give you the message and you're going to give it to your brother and your brother's going to tell pharaoh and so Moses was obedient and he went back and he went and he confronted and he saw his brother brother ER it's you he's been so long I saw the Lord God all Mighty I Saw The Great I Am and he has come to deliver his people [Music] until he has heard the Affliction he's come back to Rescue [Music] them for he has heard the Cry of his people so they marched to Egypt and they went straight into Pharaoh's courts and when they got there there was this anointing that the Egyptians had have you ever been to the mall or somewhere like a baseball stadium or a basketball St and there's just a different anointing you know something else is going on there you ever walk into a building there was that kind of anointing this was the pharaoh's Palace and everybody knew his name everybody knew his name and they called him out and said that's power oh he had [Music] power yes I am pH [Music] listen close sarin please I'm dirty in his floor you know what I am Phar Pharaoh he thought he was all that in a bag of chips and when Aaron faced him he told him what God Almighty said pharaoh on behalf of God Almighty yes we demand that you let his people go come on you got jokes really you hear these guys no tell me Aaron what did you and your dirty brother come to tell tell me don't think I forgot what he did but it's okay I'll let you step tell me what you need to tell me and you can leave like we said we come to Beal of the almighty God and we demand we're not asking we demand that you let his people go like I said you got jokes and I'm not going to listen to you I am the the god of Egypt and of all of the world and you think I'm going to let my people go you know what go worship your dirty God get out of here you and your brother cuz I am [Music] pharoh [Music] pharoh pharoh [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] yes I am [Music] pharoh and Pharaoh said no just in case you didn't get the message but God said yes see but God told Moses God said don't worry Moses because I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart so Moses knew Pharaoh was going to say no so Moses wasn't really surprised God wanted to show his mighty hand if Pharaoh would have said all right cool there you go take two weeks vacation and just come back that wouldn't have been God God wanted no doubt that he was the Living God so what he did he sent plagues he sent a plague of flies he sent he he he went and he Aaron put his staff in the Nile River and the river turned to blood the flies came the most G can you act like there's flies around you and then there was frogs everywhere but let me tell you they weren't just they weren't just plagues just for fun no see every single plague was an attack to an Egyptian god the god of the Nile couldn't stop El Shai so he turned the water into blood there was another God with the head of a fly the beetle God he couldn't control those flies swarming everywhere there's a goddess with the head of a frog so they multiplied the frogs and they infested their bedroom Chambers where they had their relig religious ceremonies there was every single plague the god of the sky he sent hail fire from the sky the god of the field he sent Locust to eat that God's field the cattle god with the head of the cow he sent the plague so they all the cows let me hear you move now let me hear you die all the cows died no more in and out no more car no more okay now you get the picture gosh man it's a big deal I said the cows died and they're like okay I say no more carada they're like Santo yes no more car thank you this was bad this
