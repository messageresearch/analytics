[25:42] i'd like to also thank our pastor for
[25:44] giving me this privilege to be up here
[25:49] may we also be praying for him on a safe
[25:51] trips in
[25:54] mexico i'll be reading
[25:57] joseph is a fruitful vine a fruitful
[26:00] vineyard spring whose branches climb
[26:02] over a wall jose
[26:05] fertil fertilizer
[26:10] with bitterness archers attacked him
[26:12] they shot at him with hostility but his
[26:15] bow remained steady his strong arms
[26:18] stayed limber because of the hand of the
[26:20] mighty one of jacob because of the
[26:23] shepherd the rock of israel because of
[26:26] your father's god who helps you
[26:29] who helps you
[26:31] los alas
[26:35] afiaron lanzando les fletches
[26:42] [Music]
[26:48] is
[27:02] who blesses you with blessings of the
[27:03] skies above blessings of the deep
[27:05] springs below blessings of the breast
[27:08] and womb
[27:09] bless blessings of the breast and womb
[27:19] your father's blessings are greater than
[27:21] the blessings of the ancient mountains
[27:28] of the age old hills
[27:32] let all these that rest on the head of
[27:34] joseph
[27:37] on the bro the prince amongst among his
[27:39] brothers
[27:44] just to make a quick prayer
[27:51] for allowing us to be here once again
[27:54] because many did not have this privilege
[27:56] to be able to wake up this morning
[28:00] but you gave
[28:14] at least one person tonight
[28:20] lord may
[28:21] you move in this place
[28:24] and may your blessings fall lord
[28:28] we put all this in your hands
[28:33] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[28:35] amen amen amen you may be seated
[28:37] brothers are sisters
[28:39] um we've been talking about joseph
[28:58] is that joseph really walked
[29:00] alone
[29:03] i mean with god of course
[29:05] but with nobody else around him
[29:08] you know and but joseph did walk with
[29:11] god
[29:13] you know and and joseph in his time
[29:16] that that you know he was sold off to
[29:19] those slave traders
[29:23] you know i can just imagine in joseph's
[29:25] mind
[29:27] you know what could have been he
[29:30] thinking of que costas
[29:32] you know and it's like
[29:34] he was he felt alone i mean
[29:38] you know he felt separated
[29:42] he felt like nobody cared for him
[29:46] you know because as as as he was walking
[29:49] in this you know in the desert
[29:52] you know in towards egypt
[29:54] you know all these thoughts just came to
[29:56] him
[29:58] you know all of these thoughts of
[29:59] loneliness
[30:01] you know and that's how you know many of
[30:04] the times
[30:06] i believe that
[30:18] you know the god of joseph jose then you
[30:23] know you know you're not walking alone
[30:26] no i don't think anybody here likes uh
[30:29] wants to feel lost
[30:32] you know or go
[30:37] you know joseph was lonely because you
[30:40] know he was alienated from his family
[30:45] and he felt like nobody cared for him
[30:51] think that you know he was like man
[30:54] there's just no hope for me
[30:59] but but let me tell you this afternoon
[31:00] brothers
[31:14] he can do as much you know
[31:16] as much as he did with joseph he can do
[31:18] with us tonight
[31:20] you know it's just that we open our
[31:22] hearts to him
[31:24] and let him come abide in us
[31:27] um
[31:29] i i think that that that joseph you know
[31:32] jose
[31:35] he had to somehow conquer his loneliness
[31:40] you know can you imagine yourself being
[31:42] you know separated from your family
[32:01] [Music]
[32:07] joseph had to endure hardship straight
[32:09] from the get-go
[32:13] difficulties if you're from the get-go
[32:15] there's a principle you know but but let
[32:17] me tell you something
[32:19] you know
[32:20] you know there's
[32:21] times that
[32:23] we feel like we can't it seems
[32:25] impossible
[32:26] is
[32:29] you know our situations seem impossible
[32:32] you know our circumstances seem
[32:34] impossible there's a circumstance
[32:36] you know
[32:37] joseph didn't focus in his troubles
[32:46] i believe that he was always
[32:48] you know focused and thinking about what
[32:50] god wanted
[32:54] um i have a from the harvard university
[32:57] a little statistic here then uh
[33:04] the harvard says according to this data
[33:07] those age 16 to 24 are the group most
[33:10] likely to report feeling lonely
[33:21] the 10 percent lonely
[33:24] feeling lonely often
[33:26] feel like that often or always
[33:30] solos
[33:32] you know but youth let me tell you
[33:33] tonight
[33:35] now you
[33:36] know that
[33:39] my god
[33:41] and i believe the god that you serve
[33:44] will not leave you
[33:46] he will not
[33:48] let you go from his hand
[33:51] you know and and you know joseph as he
[33:53] began you know walking
[33:57] you know he he might have thought like
[33:59] oh my brothers hated me
[34:02] you know and he barely escaped with his
[34:03] life because his brothers wanted
[34:11] you know and then he was put in chains
[34:14] you know i'm bound to other you know to
[34:16] other slaves you know
[34:19] um he
[34:20] marched to the desert all the way to
[34:22] egypt
[34:24] now you see a simple shepherd
[34:29] a simple shepherd young man
[34:31] you know about to enter the most
[34:33] civilized city you know of that day
[34:39] but these but the the people of uh egypt
[34:43] you know worshiped other gods
[34:46] of joseph
[34:49] they worship you know i don't know cows
[34:51] frogs
[34:53] you know but but he maintained his
[34:55] integrity with god
[34:59] you know and
[35:01] sometimes
[35:03] you know
[35:06] i mean
[35:07] many of us
[35:10] i'm not saying we are not okay you know
[35:12] but sometimes i feel like some of us
[35:14] have gone to depression
[35:17] you know i have gone to some sort of
[35:19] you know feeling
[35:21] anxiety or whatever it may be
[35:24] you know and and i i think that joseph
[35:26] might have felt that
[35:41] jesus christ
[35:56] but he promised he would stand with you
[36:00] i will go with you even to the end
[36:04] isaiah 41 10.
[36:08] you're not for i am with you
[36:11] be not dismayed for i am your god
[36:15] i will strengthen you
[36:16] i will help you
[36:18] i will uphold you with my righteous
[36:20] right hand
[36:24] no
[36:37] if we have the creator
[36:50] our problems you know
[36:52] there's nothing my god cannot do no i
[36:54] know
[36:54] no questions you know and and you know
[36:56] as we've seen that joseph you know is
[36:58] the type of christ
[37:01] you know jesus christ you know his his
[37:03] own brothers
[37:05] you know his own brothers
[37:07] you know just
[37:10] how would i say they they
[37:15] i guess we could say push them aside or
[37:17] you know
[37:18] they betrayed him sorry that was true
[37:23] and you know for joseph
[37:25] jose you know
[37:26] that emotional weights
[37:29] it must have been crushing on him
[37:33] you know how he dreamed of home
[37:39] it must have haunted him
[37:42] and maybe even blamed himself for this
[37:45] you know for being sent out you know
[37:48] he's like
[38:02] you know
[38:15] that happened to joseph
[38:21] you know everything that joseph went
[38:23] through
[38:25] you know it worked for good
[38:27] everything that you've gone through
[38:29] everything that i've gone through has
[38:32] worked for my good
[38:34] you know what has god
[38:36] done
[38:38] you know with our lives
[38:40] you know how you know how what were we
[38:42] what were we the people before
[38:49] you know joseph maybe you know he
[38:52] couldn't understand it or couldn't see
[38:54] it you know
[38:56] you know after being in such a lonely
[38:59] place
[39:01] you know
[39:02] and you know being sold
[39:06] and then potiphar you know
[39:08] and then being thrown into jail
[39:11] the baker and the and the butcher forgot
[39:13] about him
[39:14] or the try to say the sorry the the
[39:18] the cupbearer yes
[39:20] you know forgot about him
[39:22] after he told him about his dream
[39:25] no he said remember melissa
[39:37] he's still maintaining so faithful with
[39:39] god
[39:40] you know and you know
[39:42] everything that happened to joseph
[39:44] jose
[39:46] like we said you know serve for good
[39:48] company
[39:50] um
[39:53] joseph
[39:54] we'll see
[39:56] you know
[39:57] he he left everything behind
[40:00] us he left everything
[40:02] his family just everything familia told
[40:05] him you know
[40:07] to fulfill
[40:21] you know to be able to have a closer
[40:23] encounter with him
[40:25] you know to have this
[40:26] you know closer you know
[40:29] approach to him you know
[40:31] she'll be able to trust him
[40:34] you know in our situations and our
[40:35] problems
[40:40] you know
[40:42] i i found this this quote on the
[40:44] internet
[40:46] that you know when god has selected you
[41:04] let me tell you
[41:17] you know just give it all to me
[41:20] you know that's what joseph did it's a
[41:22] location he had to just surrender it all
[41:24] to god
[41:25] you know for the plan of god to be
[41:26] fulfilled
[41:28] you know for his plan to be able to
[41:30] happen
[41:44] i don't have it there but you can just
[41:45] interpret it
[41:47] is this and just think of that
[41:49] now all this is bound to speak of
[41:51] something
[41:53] it just can't be no
[41:55] or just say well it's just a coincidence
[41:59] or just merely happen that way
[42:17] now these things
[42:20] are for a purpose
[42:22] and you know
[42:25] joseph we'll see
[42:27] you know
[42:30] it wasn't a coincidence that he had to
[42:32] go through each and every one of these
[42:34] things
[42:35] it wasn't a coincidence that god had to
[42:37] take him through some point of his life
[42:41] you know to be able to fulfill
[42:44] you know fulfill what god had planned
[42:46] for him
[42:47] you know and so and and i believe that
[42:49] we
[42:50] cannot you know i myself have to just
[42:52] let go completely so guys
[42:56] so god
[43:10] is so great and so marvelous
[43:14] you know that it doesn't matter
[43:16] important what we may be going through
[43:21] he always has
[43:22] el siempre tiene a good outcome
[43:26] he always has el salvador a purpose for
[43:30] it amen amen amen
[43:34] now
[43:35] joseph what i will say
[43:38] you
[43:38] know
[43:40] he
[43:41] maintained his integrity
[43:44] you know in in in what god wanted right
[43:48] yeah you know and it it kind of reminds
[43:51] me
[43:52] of me you know because because joseph
[43:54] had to be i was always i believe
[43:56] occupied in doing something
[44:00] you know like even though he was in the
[44:02] prison cell
[44:03] even though he was wherever he was
[44:06] you know he was always trying to do
[44:07] something
[44:09] you know as my mom tells me
[44:19] you know a mind that is not not not
[44:22] doing anything it's you know satan's
[44:24] jail whatever you know um but so we
[44:28] always have to be doing something you
[44:29] know
[44:31] you know let's let's always be doing
[44:33] something for god
[44:45] you know
[44:46] seeking what god wants for my life
[45:03] you know and so
[45:07] if if i could leave you with something
[45:08] this afternoon
[45:12] it would be to not give up
[45:16] because joseph you know could have said
[45:17] oh i'll give up now
[45:21] you know i'll give up you know i i'll
[45:23] just let go
[45:25] you know god is just god you know
[45:28] but what if i just let go what's going
[45:30] to happen
[45:55] so if i could leave you with something
[45:58] and if you can please stand
[46:12] and what god

[51:14] [Music]
[51:20] i see joseph's life
[51:24] he did what was right
[51:29] and many times
[51:32] and bad things happened to
[51:34] him that was bad we could see
[51:38] that his own mother
[51:40] died
[51:45] when she gave birth unto benjamin
[51:48] despues
[51:49] later on afterwards
[51:51] they departed him from his father
[51:53] separated him
[51:55] he's separated from his homeland
[51:59] and then after his own brethren
[52:02] wanted
[52:15] then once he got to egypt uh foreign
[52:57] after everything he went through
[53:00] la pena it was worth it all
[53:07] he was he was left to be in second in
[53:09] command
[53:11] the governor of egypt
[53:22] joseph prospered in all things
[53:26] and as we
[53:37] christ life
[53:44] we know the lord jesus christ
[53:47] he was hated
[53:50] by his own come on
[53:52] just like joseph was perfect
[54:06] forgive me brethren
[54:22] and rejected
[54:34] that the jews reject jesus
[55:02] amen that's right man amen
[55:17] i could say i'm doing things right i'm
[55:19] trying to do good
[55:21] job
[55:22] i have fixed up my life
[55:26] but then all of a sudden things come to
[55:28] our lives
[55:30] can i say well why does this happen
[55:40] maybe you may say i'm complaining about
[55:42] it you see joseph
[55:44] and i'm very i complain a lot
[55:54] [Music]
[56:00] there's
[56:38] and then we ask the question god why is
[56:40] it happening
[57:10] that break our hearts
[57:13] mucho we suffer a lot
[57:18] because we're doing things right
[57:21] and then we don't deserve that
[57:38] i think
[57:47] but then god didn't give it to me
[57:53] [Music]
[58:02] but then i go and say but god i'm doing
[58:04] things right we're gonna pull out the
[58:05] net why can't i have it
[58:10] but there's a purpose
[58:13] that's right
[58:14] yes sir
[58:18] thank you to god
[58:31] if i hadn't gone through what i went
[58:33] through
[58:39] [Music]
[58:48] it was my own decision
[58:51] and it was an incorrect decision
[58:56] things happen for a reason
[59:00] and i was saying to that brother
[59:16] but i remember one time my pastor told
[59:17] me and i said it the first time i
[59:19] preached
[59:20] yes you have
[59:22] questions
[59:24] to say what god has done in your life
[59:31] and we are children of god brothers
[59:35] we go through things that we don't
[59:36] understand
[59:39] but i give thanks unto god
[59:42] i give thanks unto god
[59:55] today's day
[1:00:26] and if things don't go
[1:00:35] trying everything better it doesn't
[1:00:36] still come out my way
[1:00:38] that's right
[1:01:07] and so maybe you may fall
[1:01:11] or you overcome that test
[1:01:18] i said once
[1:01:19] i was praying
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:51] i don't know about you i don't feel like
[1:01:52] i'm the only one
[1:01:57] i had to leave that ego
[1:02:00] that pride
[1:02:02] comments
[1:02:04] start to
[1:02:14] son of god
[1:02:18] [Music]

[1:04:07] pentecostal i started to go to the
[1:04:09] coastal church

[1:04:33] born if i can say christian
[1:04:38] i was born a son of a pastor
[1:04:42] and emmy
[1:04:44] but a point came into my life
[1:04:46] don't they just come and say i don't

[1:04:49] when i started to go to a baptist church
[1:04:53] [Music]

[1:08:15] i said what why is this happening
[1:08:18] and the second time in which i had
[1:08:20] preached
[1:08:25] and then i was hit with kovitz
[1:08:34] and thanks be to god
[1:08:50] e
[1:08:55] and i started to cry
[1:08:58] i said god i'm trying to do your will
[1:09:01] what is this going on
[1:09:06] i'm trying to do something good i'm not
[1:09:08] doing nothing bad
