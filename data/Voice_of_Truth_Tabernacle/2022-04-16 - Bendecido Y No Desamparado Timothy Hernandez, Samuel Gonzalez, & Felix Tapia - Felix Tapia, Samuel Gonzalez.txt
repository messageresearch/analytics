i've been set free [Music] [Music] you supply [Music] my [Music] you are more than [Music] amen god bless you this afternoon happy to be here once again amen amen when you have it can you say amen i want to thank our beloved pastor for giving me the privilege and trust he's interested in me is and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of canaan these are the generations of jacob joseph being 17 years old was feeling was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his father's wives and joseph brought into his father their evil report is i want you to pay close attention to verse three now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was a son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him amen amen your heavenly like the song that our brothers and sisters were singing earlier we place this service in your hands and help us amen amen may be seated how many of you know that jose had that joseph had seven brothers joseph was born brother because he was born of his old age [Music] was inspired in the supernatural way that we are inspired we have this visa amen how many can say he jose that they were jealous of joseph jose in the message joseph meeting with his brothers jose never did joseph ever cope with them he was hated and rejected for the same purpose that the rest of them were because god was with him in the supernatural way and in a different way that was in a different way than what he was with the rest of them and they hated him without a cause he hated him without a cause jesus jesus hated without a cost and we can see nowadays amen amen you know he uh and at that moment that's when their brother his brothers wanted to kill joseph but they're in that moment espanol correcto okay explains i on the other side if god can do something on a youth like joseph amen and let me tell you that courage to stand firm with god foreign not going to do that and john says she but in reality amen amen amen christian 53. walks after spiritual things to the world its carnal mind is necessary it's foolishness [Music] it's everlasting there [Music] one side of him he had one of your own brothers [Applause] my the last the last paragraph cristo shall be taken some of these days the old desert shop and rough places will be made [Music] hey man don't let me receive spiritual [Applause] god bless you brother you all look beautiful tonight he could please stand up for a moment i appreciate every one of you tonight like to give thanks to my pastor tito and jesus christ you're giving me the trust to be here with truly a blessing to be here yes right away if you please open your bibles to genesis 37. you have me please man and it says like this now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors along without like to include a verse including which i think personally is a key verse for me okay and it says like this but as for you ye thought evil against me mal contra me but god meant it unto good ma i have the privilege along with my brother timothy and my brother felix timothy romano felix just introduced the new bible character persona amen tonight i want to speak about the life of joseph you know joseph was a special born boy josef special to his father especially you see joseph was the youngest of all his brothers jose almost you see joseph as the youngest brother jose ellerman you know he took care of the sheep of his father and here we can see how special joseph was to jacob yeah gave joseph a co of many colors a robe jacob is and i believe i truly believe that jacob didn't give that to him not just because he was the favorite no solo preference i believe that the reason jacob gave that to josephus jose is because he saw something special especially he could not see in the other brothers he saw something different no he gets sold as a slave to egypt i love anthony you know there he works for potiphar general of egypt and there he is tempted no he's tempted there because of that he was sent into prison you know and there god granted him the gift of interpreting dreams and you know because of that joseph was the right-hand man that god always fulfills his promises so even if it doesn't seem like it even if it seems like the enemy is winning if it seems like god forgot about us always with joseph [Music] god will fulfill every promise god and you know that's why we identify ourselves with joseph sometimes identification you see in the life of joseph jose we could see an example for each and every one of us example for us even though all the things the brothers have done to him in the end look at joseph jose and his capacity for forgiveness look at joseph jose you see when when the world was under a famine a famine during that time you know how was israel how was the city of israel saved comfort salvador foreign amen i'm amen you see when i see the life of joseph i see grace just like our brother timothy timothy you see grace manifested in the life of jose you know in genesis 37 i'm not going to read it genesis 37 20 is shows that his brothers you know they were plotting to kill him established you see the grace of god you see in genesis 37 26. it shows that reuben no he wasn't there and once again the brothers start plotting [Music] wherever he was preached in 1962 and it says like this look at joseph jose born among his brethren hatred of his brothers sold for pretty near 30 pieces of silver portrait and he was taken up from this ditch and went and sat at the to return to one more time how we could go through the problem and show that that was really the spirit of it oh christ the christian prophet do you believe that see you see if it wasn't for joseph's office you wouldn't have saved all those people was it for jesus we wouldn't be here right now there's always a person and when he says [Music] are you going to go towards there's going to be something good in the end there's going to be god god bless you brothers and sisters we're happy to be here brother we have to train them like there will be of tomorrow if not then for today you know i admire that so much because the world has so many things to offer but you know but they made the choice to be here and serve the lord with other hearts if you can turn your your bibles to genesis 37 4. we thank god for the for the opportunity um it says like this it says that when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him you know i'm going to be talking about joseph again well because on a day like today see joseph was loved by his father josef and he was hated and he was hated by his brothers because he was different he was different like in a supernatural way you know he was more spiritual than his brothers and his brothers did it hated him without a cause you know they tried to kill him you know and they threw him in a ditch and they left them for dead you know but god had grace on him and let him live you know and he was picked up by slave traders you know and he was sold for almost 30 pieces of silver you know i believe it was around 20 what the bible says and just like jesus christ was sold for 30 pieces of silver jesus brother branham says that joseph jose the same as jesus christ and if we bring it to the church on today and we bring it to today's christianity you know we are hated by the world as well you know sometimes we're seen as a little crazy a little weird you know and i know sometimes it's hard and i put myself there you know it's hard for me to to to not like the things of this world you know because that's the nature of this flesh it's the nature to to fall to the things of this world don't fall to the things of the world you know it doesn't matter if they don't love you you know like i said this before you know we were not saying here to be loved by the world but to show the world what is you know i love them so much how could they do this to me but you know when he was picked up you know he was sent to egypt you know and he it was at that time it was the biggest commercial cd in the world [Music] and he he moved up quickly you know in in before he he you had to get through him and enter the palace but you know you have to get to him you know and even though in his lowest point you know god was with him and he was with him in every moment even to the point when he was in his highest point you know god was still with him you know god god never left them it didn't matter how the devil tried to destroy him but he couldn't destroy that seed that was in him you know because god was always with him and god is always with us on a day like today like i said earlier or more than 2 000 years ago jesus christ surrendered everything so he can be with us he was crucified in the cross he was sold for 30 pieces of silver portraying plata and when he was on his way to be crucified in the cross crucificado you know people were spitting at him like people were probably throwing things at him you know he just had probably gotten the biggest whipping that anybody can think of he was b you know he he i'm pretty sure at that moment he probably wanted to give up you know he wanted to say i can't do this you know he could have probably sent archangels at that moment you know he was thinking about us in that moment it didn't matter how how painful that was and when they crucified him equando le crucificaron he said father forgive them for they don't know what they do you know in that moment you know the devil probably thought el diablo [Music] you know but at the end right before he passed away you know before he surrendered the spirit he died and he said it is finished and he went you know what brothers he went and at that moment he poured his whole spirit into the church [Music] and he said i'm going to be with my children in every moment you know god is with us in every moment and just like and there is nothing that can destroy us you know god is with us esta conosotros in every moment you know we might not see him maybe we can't touch him but he is with us in a supernatural way max luciano once said they try to destroy our spiritual life spiritual they may tell us you know why are you going to church you know you'll find better happiness out in the world you know maybe you you'll be better out there you know but god is with us even when we're fighting sicknesses and they're trying to destroy us you know i i came from a place you know where i was addicted from drugs you know i was addicted to many different things are different you know and god always tried to destroy me and the devil always tried to destroy me you know but god was always there with me you know it didn't matter how far you go down you know god is always there with you yo it doesn't matter what tries to destroy you god is the only thing we need when we don't have friends amigos he is the friend that is there when we lose everything and everything may seem destroyed [Music] god is there with us yo and it doesn't matter what tries to destroy you and i i i look at joseph jose you know what every way he was almost destroyed you know he tried his brothers trying to destroy him uh part of that's wife tried to destroy him and and uh and the buzz butler tried to destroy him you know and god was still with him in that moment you know god never left his side you know and god will never abandon us you know and i believe that god has shown you outstead you know when you don't feel like giving up you know you say i can't do this no more you know i had said this many times going to help me read hebrews 13 5 and 6. let your conversation be without covetness and be content with such things as you have for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me. we should not be fearful of what's coming to us you know because god is always with me you know the musicians can pass you know brother when you feel like giving up you know just know that god is always there with you no matter what record okay when you hear that little voice inside of you that's how you keep going keep on going just a little bit longer that is god speaking to your because there is nothing that can destroy you absolutely i'm going to read this this quote by brother branham brother vidal can you help me please um do not fear whatever wherever to go or what for the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you wherever you go so he can't satan can't kill me until god says it's finished see he might try it but he'll never succeed in doing it [Music] [Music] you know he will try time after time you know every moment he will try you know but he will never succeed in doing [Music] you are a hero in god's eyes it doesn't matter who tries to snatch your you know in revelations 3 20 it says you know god is waiting for you to come back do not take this moment for granted if you want to just talk to him i know you're with me [Music] he's just waiting for you to open your door to him if you were just opening your heart to him tonight [Music] i am here [Music] [Music] and we will both one [Music] one day when we get to heaven we're going to be standing with people that are rejected and cast out with the world those are the people that you're going to be standing with [Music] [Music] god if there would be someone here tonight lord that
