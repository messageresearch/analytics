continue talking about Gideon and the title that me and my brothers chose a war is near Proxima you know Gideon was a man of Valor era you know what does Valor mean you know it means qualities of a hero you know and it's a a person with her heroic courage when he is facing danger especially in battle especially he he God called him because he knew that he was a man of Valor is you know he was full of Courage but if we look at verse 13. you know he says he says he said but Lord but if the Lord is with us why why has this all this has happened to us where is all the Wonders there are ancestors told us about it he is talking about his his ancestors which was the Israelites when they took him out of egyptus but the Lord is has abandoned us he said foreign love those we go to people's homes you know we see it boom right there in somebody's wall you know God is the same yesterday and today you know we go to the stores you know we see it boom God is God is the same yesterday today and forever you know it's something so common you know God God is able to help if God was able to do something for them and be able to help Gideon you know how much more can he do with us thank you sometimes we say there is no way God can use me foreign see young man Holiness and young woman you know we make mistakes you know but God wants us to be men and women of Valerie valientes you know God wants to use us in great ways see if he is the same God that was in Genesis 1 1. he is the same guy that is here today that's in judges 6 23 it says and the Lord said unto him peace be unto you thee and fear not that you shall not die you know he told him he told Gideon go down where you know go burnt those altars wait sorry I I messed up talk he he went and told him go burn those don't go tear down those altars of Belle is he went and did that before he went to work he went he went and did that before he went to battle foreign foreign it doesn't matter what's going on in my life it doesn't matter about the doubt that I have no important it doesn't matter how what the circumcised look what the circumstance look like but you have to say God you need to use me necesitas you know you have you have to just go come down and burn everything down you know burn down all those Idols you know me I have to burn down maybe the sport titles you know I have to let them go because they're not going to get give me salvation you know right now the World Cup is going on [Music] you know it's going down you know and I haven't even sat down and watched the whole game I'm just too busy at work you know there's just so much going on you know and I just need to that that's what God wants you know today I was I I wanted to sit down it was a light day you know but I remember what I needed to do for God and that's to give a war to the enemies you know you're not going to take me from these things of this Earth You know sometimes that's what we need to do we just don't need to let ourselves hold back you know we're men and women of Courage almost Hombres that valentia you know God just just didn't chose us just to be just anybody you know God chose us to be someone special to be Warriors of God and to fight for God I want to read this quote every innocence from it from to a mighty to a mighty mighty man of God a man of Valor going down to deliver look at Gideon what happened yes sir he going down with a crooked with a crooked state to take over a nation he did it yes he did God told him to no matter how unreal it seems you just know what God tells you to do and you'll find out that that his word is still the same is you know we just have to it doesn't matter how unreal it seems how much we say oh God can't use us it doesn't matter we have to trust in God and know that his word is the same it doesn't matter how unreal it seems we just gotta trust ourselves in God and say God you're going to use me if God used one man you know to gather those soldiers you know how much more can God use you we just have to give our courage God just use me you know it doesn't matter what the world says about me it doesn't matter how much I fail just know God can use you just know that God can use you and he will help you out that's all I have for today Brothers [Applause] God bless you man it's always good to be in the house of God Amen and if we can open our Bibles to the Book of Judges chapter 6 verse 11. I'm gonna go ahead and read it and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which is was an ofra that pertaining to joash the abyss right and the sun Gideon thresh wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and one more verse in the book of Galatians chapter 5 verse 7. it says you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth [Music] amen may God the blessings to the reading of his words amen so we see here in the in the verse that we just read Palace who hindered you okay what stopped you what kept you from going further amen and in the case you find that he was in a place of comfortable to his situation he knew that each year that they were going to come and take all that he hasn't figured that he just might as well prepare for it amen and you find that when you're in a place of comfort when you're in your comfort zone your mentality is narrow we uh you're in you have tunnel vision amen but God isn't going to give you Eternal Vision God wants to show you more of what he has sometimes we're so narrow-minded with what we want amen sometimes we're so narrow-minded with what we want but we don't see what God has for us and that's a dangerous place to be yes I think it's the most dangerous place if you want to progress amen amen because Comfort is the is he is the worst enemy of Progresso why because nothing gets done when you're coming being being comfortable leads to no growth I I was reading and as I was researching Comforts I read a quote that I really liked amen and it says it feels good to be comfortable no flowers grow there amen Christian Flores where there's no struggle Brothers there's no growth amen and your comfort zone is essentially designed to make you feel okay amen and perhaps Gideon didn't feel 100 safe in his neighborhood I mean since he was hiding you know amen he didn't he didn't really have a desperation though you didn't have a desperation to change his living circles by living under the rule of foreign it was like separating the grain the edible part of the plant from the from the part that you can't use and what we can take from this is that God starts with the little things amen Amen brother Brown says in the message God projecting his love um brother Brown says we are taught it's not the big things that we do it's the little things that we leave undone hey man I know personally for me it's not praying in the mornings amen I know that it's hard for me sometimes I wake up in a good mood you know energized and I I go down to pray and I fall asleep for 15 minutes or my legs fall asleep what happens you know and uh or it's not uh spending adequate amount of time with God amen amen all it takes is 15 minutes to change your life I don't know about you but I think it's a pretty sweet deals for 15 minutes for uh an eternity with him amen amen or maybe it's not Consulting god with any any decisions you make no matter how big or small they are important amen into thresh is essentially to separate so you're separating the grain from the plants amen and God found him alone amen because God was separating him from all the unbelief because at the time the people that the the people of Israel they they were they were believing in foreign [Music] amen so then we see that the Angels seeing something in Gideon that Gideon couldn't even see in himself and then we see that God sees much further than what we can amen amen and a lot of times I wonder um what if I understood the whole plan of God for my life um you know I feel like I wouldn't believe him then because I want to see how it would be possible you know how all that would happen you know but a lot of times it's not just it's not maybe not understanding amen just believe in God anyways that faith is when you can't explain how it happened amen amen we see that getting made all kinds of excuses about himself he said that he was incapable and God I'm sure that it made him feel bad when God told him he was a mighty man and he was hiding um but that just goes to show that when we make excuses God looks to make progression may have displayed himself as somebody that couldn't person qualities that just goes to show that it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks of you if you just keep your eyes on what he thinks of amen amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen God doesn't want you in a relaxed State [Music] because when you're in a relaxed State and this is foreign and I like what brother Branham says in the message I am the resurrection in the life he says see just as soon as I believe he said he can't help me till I believe I've Got to Believe In confess and then God's under obligation to his words you can do all things foreign [Music] you need to start making some noise because essentially it was a noise that that won his first battle foreign amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen and I want you to notice that in that story that they didn't profess anything of their own um to take his word with him amen amen so don't when you have her in you you're enduring a trial don't profess anything of your own profession don't try to go It Alone go to God go on your knees to him that's what he's there foreign [Music] right amen amen God bless you brothers that's all I have do you live [Applause] amen amen God bless you Brothers so happy to see you every one of you tonight is happy to be in the house of the Lord I just want to start off by saying no youth colonists you know we're so blessed to be here you know sometimes I gotta remind myself of this is you know you we're so blessed to be here because there are many young men and women out in the world doing drugs they were young young women over there being prostitutes there's a lot of addicts in over there outside that we are still here and we're still fighting you see and this is why we're different from the world because we continue fighting hey man I'm just gonna get right into it because I don't have a lot of time if you could please open your Bibles to Judges chapter 6 verse 13 and 16 questions and it says like this said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befall in us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites verse 14 and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee is and he said unto him and I am the least in my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with you tonight as one manitas amen amen amen ah man a war is rising approxima how many Believers are here tonight I recognize there is a war Rising the Bible says that God brought us into this world you see God brought us to a battlefield because we are soldiers of the Lord and one of the soldiers of the Lord which I want to talk about tonight which we are focusing on you know how our brother Felix said no giri was a man of Valor and which Valor means not afraid of fighting the battle foreign [Music] foreign amen amen and one of these tests was mirian itas the Bible says that this nation is risen up against Israel and the children of Israel had done evil in the eyes of God and because of that God Allah so because of this year after year the midianites would come in at Harvest Time and either take or destroy what was Israel because and you see and in this way Israel was so impoverished Israel was so oppressed in such a way to it was kind of hard to see this follow us because the people of Israel people who not only knew God people who not only had experiences I've seen the Miracles and wonders of God but for some reason the people forgot what God was you see they forgot they forgot the God who did Miracles who not only did wonderful things but who delivered them from the enemies and many of the times foreign [Music] because the for what but what they were going through during those times that when they were at the point of having victory Victoria you see maybe we were about to see the the results of our prayers is a spirit is a spirit that comes to steal as soon as to fill our heart lives with fears you see that's why there's so many frustrated Christians that's why there are many brothers and sisters but we don't reap you see there is always something there is always something that steals our blessings is there anyone like Israel here tonight when we were about to have victories when we are about to have that Victory here comes in youth Communists Satan El Diablo always manages to to steal what belonged to us still our blessings this is what brother Brandon says he said then sir if God is with us where's all of his mighty Miracles the prophet told us that he was the god that brought us up out of Egypt he spoke to land he delivered us he's a god of Deliverance and if he ever was God he's still gone he is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you see Brothers the Israelites didn't believe in God's promises all they wanted to believe was God's blessings and they thought that because they were called Children of the Lord whatever they wanted foreign [Music] foreign you see Brothers we are his instruments but how can God use us if we still have these bad habits in US ERS to see in benches and let what you heard tonight God created Warriors God created Warriors you see just like Gideon God made us Overcomers tonight brothers and sisters we have the opportunity to tear down our altars we just need to let God so then he could use amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] meanwhile the people of Israel were scared let me show you tonight meanwhile you stay there the same mientes God cannot use God cannot use you see let me tell you tonight [Music] will break the chain of fears many things will happen in our lives there will be trials and dark times cry out to me and I will respond [Music] God promised that he will be with us foreign [Applause] [Music] I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I just want to tell you tonight through Christ we can overcome all things tonight let us cry out to God and let us rip those old habits just open your hearts out tonight yeah bless you man glory to God amen [Music]
