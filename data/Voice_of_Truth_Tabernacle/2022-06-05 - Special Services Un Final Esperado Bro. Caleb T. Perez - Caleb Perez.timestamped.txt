[59:00] a beggar came
[59:02] and sat
[59:24] [Music]
[59:28] and i began to tell him of all the
[59:30] types of bread that there were yeah
[59:35] i told him everything i knew about bread
[59:40] i spoke of flour and wheat
[59:44] grain and
[59:57] but i looked up and i was surprised that
[59:59] he was not smiling
[1:00:04] i just
[1:00:05] want bread
[1:00:08] how wise for the saviors i applaud his
[1:00:12] choice
[1:00:15] follow me and i'll show you our bakery
[1:00:21] took him down the hall
[1:00:24] guided him
[1:00:26] with a different room
[1:00:54] is
[1:00:56] i knew he was moved as we stepped into
[1:00:58] this auditorium
[1:01:02] full of stained glass windows
[1:01:07] the beggar did not
[1:01:47] and i read them the recipe from the
[1:01:49] cookbook of life
[1:01:53] by now the beggar had taken a seat on
[1:01:55] the front row
[1:02:01] i knew what he wanted
[1:02:04] he wanted to hear me speak
[1:02:07] so i asked him would you like to hear me
[1:02:09] speak
[1:02:10] here
[1:02:13] he said no
[1:02:14] no i just want friends
[1:02:18] oh why so far i replied because savior
[1:02:20] is and get him to the front door of the
[1:02:23] bakery
[1:02:25] what i have to say next is very
[1:02:26] important
[1:02:29] i told him as we stood outside
[1:02:46] i know one who adds two spoons of salt
[1:02:48] rather than one
[1:02:50] of those
[1:02:52] i know another whose oven is three
[1:02:54] degrees too hot
[1:02:58] they call it bread
[1:03:15] looked back at me and shrugged his
[1:03:16] shoulders
[1:03:19] and said i guess i just lost my appetite
[1:03:24] i shook my head and returned to my
[1:03:25] office
[1:03:56] the world is just desiring a piece of
[1:03:58] paper
[1:04:00] i believe this morning if you've come
[1:04:02] with the right attitude
[1:04:05] i believe you'll take and you'll receive
[1:04:07] the bread of the lord
[1:04:24] you will
[1:05:32] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[1:05:36] the disciples came unto him privately
[1:05:38] saying tell us
[1:05:40] when shall these things be
[1:05:43] that is when one stone shall not be left
[1:05:45] upon another
[1:05:47] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:05:50] and of the end of the world
[1:05:59] is
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:12] amen may god add his blessings to the
[1:06:14] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:06:33] many times it is a word that brings a
[1:06:36] lot of fear into people
[1:06:40] the bible is full of phrases
[1:06:44] that talks about the
[1:06:54] [Music]
[1:06:55] and each one of those phrases deals with
[1:06:57] time
[1:07:12] so very fearful
[1:07:21] now i don't know how many of i can if i
[1:07:23] can see your hands
[1:07:39] the more the moment we see pandemic
[1:07:43] churches began to be false
[1:07:47] people are fearful
[1:07:49] and that's one of the things that we
[1:07:51] find out through those wholes
[1:08:20] we do not have the knowledge the wisdom
[1:08:22] of what these words really mean
[1:08:26] pray that this really helps you
[1:08:31] into your soul
[1:08:34] we are not afraid anymore
[1:08:50] which simply is the fear of the end of
[1:08:53] the world
[1:08:55] anybody here have doomsday photos
[1:09:00] we want to go as a sunday school this
[1:09:01] morning
[1:09:03] how many of you how many of you have
[1:09:05] doomsday phobias
[1:09:08] and if you hear the end of the world oh
[1:09:09] my god
[1:09:11] your palms get sweaty
[1:09:15] maybe your neck
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:17] oh you get a little nervous
[1:09:20] is anybody here
[1:09:22] you watch you watch too much cnn and
[1:09:24] what happens
[1:09:26] oh you start to go crazy
[1:09:29] you become like a neurotic
[1:09:32] my goodness we're at the end
[1:09:34] but let me tell you without
[1:09:36] understanding
[1:09:38] without knowledge
[1:09:40] it will destroy us
[1:09:44] yes sir yes yoshi hosea 4 6 says this
[1:09:47] jose cuatro says my people are destroyed
[1:09:53] because of world war ii
[1:09:59] my people are destroyed
[1:10:14] no no it doesn't say that nobody says it
[1:10:16] says my people are destroyed for lack of
[1:10:19] knowledge
[1:10:22] without knowledge of what is happening
[1:10:26] for what is going to happen
[1:10:43] it gets us to feeling a certain way
[1:10:45] paranoid
[1:10:48] depressed and everything else
[1:10:51] but i'm here to tell you
[1:10:53] that's the only way for us not to be
[1:10:56] fearful
[1:11:33] [Music]
[1:11:46] that right i mean
[1:11:47] there's a lot of people out there
[1:11:50] there's a lot of preachers which is a
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:35] and that's in verse 14.
[1:12:37] and it simply says this this is
[1:12:39] implementation and the gospel of the
[1:12:42] kingdom
[1:12:44] shall be preached
[1:12:46] in all the world for a witness
[1:12:57] now i have to get this and make sure
[1:12:59] that you understand me where i'm going
[1:13:01] with it okay
[1:13:02] so
[1:13:10] and what's the sign of the coming and of
[1:13:13] the end of the world
[1:13:44] those are two different words
[1:13:47] but it talks about the end of the world
[1:13:50] the greek word is soon
[1:13:54] but when it talks about the end
[1:13:57] the greek word is telos
[1:14:00] ah
[1:14:01] now you have to take this and because to
[1:14:04] know where i'm going
[1:14:07] when the gospel of the kingdom is
[1:14:09] preached in all the worlds
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:51] but these words are jesus speaking
[1:14:54] i
[1:15:05] you go on and he says i am the first
[1:15:22] why are
[1:15:50] i want you to catch that you're okay
[1:15:51] captain is because to see jesus christ
[1:15:54] in everything
[1:15:56] in spanish brother henry help us out in
[1:15:58] espanol he says i am alpha you say yo
[1:16:02] omega ah
[1:16:47] we are creatures of time
[1:16:50] and we are finite in our minds
[1:16:54] and we cannot process the infinite
[1:16:58] process
[1:16:59] we cannot process the
[1:17:14] he's
[1:17:25] and it is
[1:17:26] not so much a period of
[1:17:41] i gotta let that one just sink
[1:17:56] we always think of it oh my gosh the end
[1:17:58] of the world
[1:18:00] disaster
[1:18:02] it's the end of all things
[1:18:05] not to the believer nope
[1:18:08] she's not fearful of this
[1:18:10] she's not fearful of that word
[1:18:13] watch as this unfolds this morning
[1:18:17] notice what the bible says
[1:18:20] he that endureth
[1:18:22] unto the end
[1:18:25] it doesn't say he that endures to the
[1:18:27] end of the world
[1:18:30] it says he that endureth unto thee
[1:18:38] then let's follow that for a moment
[1:18:41] because the scripture does not lie
[1:18:44] what it's talking about
[1:18:47] he that endureth unto
[1:18:49] the goal
[1:18:52] he that
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:19:05] until the fulfillment of
[1:19:34] we don't have an end church
[1:19:38] listen to me
[1:19:39] we don't have an egg
[1:19:42] i'm just gonna see what happens at the
[1:19:44] end
[1:19:46] come on
[1:19:49] you know the the greatest spirit that
[1:19:51] there is
[1:19:53] in a church
[1:19:54] the greatest bad spirit i should say
[1:19:58] in the church in legalism can somebody
[1:19:59] tell me what it is
