[15:40] [Music]
[15:52] foreign
[15:53] [Music]
[16:13] [Applause]
[16:14] [Music]
[16:27] bless you
[16:29] it's always good to be in the house of
[16:31] the Lord
[16:33] amen if we can open up our scriptures
[16:43] chapter five
[16:47] in verse one
[16:50] whenever you can say Amen when you have
[16:52] it
[16:59] again maybe we'll go ahead and read it
[17:01] and
[17:06] [Music]
[17:20] also in time passed when Saul was King
[17:22] over us and that was he that let us out
[17:25] and brought us in Israel and the Lord
[17:27] said to thee Thou shalt Feed My People
[17:29] Israel and thou shalt be a captain
[17:41] [Music]
[17:48] so all the elements of Israel came to
[17:51] the king
[17:52] to him running King David made a league
[17:54] with them in Hebron before the Lord and
[17:57] they anointed David King over Israel
[17:58] boys
[18:08] and then we'll jump down to verse 10
[18:11] real quick
[18:13] and it reads like this it says and David
[18:17] went on and grew great and the Lord God
[18:19] of host is with him
[18:27] and if we can bow our heads and pray to
[18:30] the Lord
[18:32] Heavenly Father Celestial we thank you
[18:35] Father for another opportunity you've
[18:36] given us to be in your house
[18:41] we come here humbly before
[18:44] simply asking that you come and speak to
[18:46] us Lord Jesus
[18:48] help us God to receive your word Lord
[18:51] Jesus
[19:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:10] amen amen you may be seated
[19:14] amen today we're going to be talking a
[19:16] little bit about David
[19:20] amen and uh how his Reign began
[19:24] amen and for a title we've chosen
[19:29] identified with the king
[19:32] I mean if I could place a subtitles
[19:40] amen amen so just to paint a picture
[19:43] here
[19:45] we see that David
[19:47] after the passing of Saul
[19:52] um pointed once again
[19:54] and he's placed as king amen
[19:58] amen so David in in us what he's doing
[20:01] is he's uniting the two kingdoms
[20:07] is Judah and Israel that's what he did
[20:10] amen
[20:12] amen in that verse 10 I really spoke to
[20:14] me when it said
[20:17] he went on and grew great amen
[20:23] amen because the Lord God of hosts was
[20:25] with him one more time because the Lord
[20:28] God of host was with him
[20:31] amen and I just want to talk a little
[20:33] bit about what it means to be and or to
[20:36] do
[20:39] amen because many of us want to be
[20:42] Christians amen
[20:44] I know I certainly do
[20:47] amen however wanting to be a Christian
[20:51] Cristiano doesn't necessarily mean it's
[20:53] true
[20:56] amen I always wanted to go pro yo
[21:00] professional in whatever athletic
[21:02] activity
[21:04] remember I didn't have the discipline or
[21:07] the genetics
[21:14] unless there's an action
[21:17] that accompanies a desire we have for uh
[21:20] to be a Christian
[21:23] it won't come to pass amen
[21:26] lives there amen how we have to know
[21:28] that we are Christians amen
[21:31] I mean if we can bring this to David
[21:34] we can see that David may not have known
[21:36] that he was a King
[21:39] David may not have seen the plans that
[21:42] God had for him
[21:44] but from a young age we can see God
[21:47] preparing David for his purpose
[21:49] [Music]
[21:53] we see that God wanted a Shepherd for
[21:56] his people
[21:59] God sent David out to Shepherd's Sheep
[22:02] amen
[22:04] amen God wanted a warrior
[22:07] so God sent David out to to lead all the
[22:10] military campaigns under King Saul amen
[22:17] now I imagine as a Young Man
[22:20] David may not have always wanted to do
[22:23] these things
[22:25] maybe he didn't always want to go out
[22:27] and tend to Sheep
[22:30] amen because when you read in the
[22:31] Scripture it gives the impression
[22:34] that it wasn't a walk down the block
[22:37] amen okay
[22:40] it might have been a couple miles out
[22:45] and I'm sure you went by foot amen
[22:49] perhaps were some battles he didn't want
[22:51] to fight
[22:53] but he still went on amen
[22:57] amen and what about us
[22:59] maybe there are things in our lives that
[23:02] we don't want to do amen
[23:04] there may be times we don't want to come
[23:06] to church
[23:08] sometimes we don't want to pray or read
[23:10] the Bible
[23:12] one thing I can say for certainly
[23:16] is that if we're here in in this
[23:19] building tonight
[23:26] amen David didn't shy away from what God
[23:28] wanted for him
[23:32] and that all led up to this moment
[23:35] um as him being crowned as kings
[23:40] amen so then I ask you youth
[23:44] where has God placed you amen
[23:48] amen what are you going through right
[23:50] now
[23:52] many times God wants to use us amen
[23:56] but he needs those attributes to be
[23:58] released from us
[24:02] maybe God wants someone honest
[24:06] so he presents an opportunity
[24:10] maybe God needs an overcomer
[24:13] so he places Us in Temptation
[24:17] amen God wants to use us and he wants to
[24:21] show us who we truly are
[24:24] amen amen praise be together adios
[24:28] amen now if we can just imagine for a
[24:31] moment
[24:33] what it would have been like if David
[24:35] had rejected his identity as a king
[24:40] if when Samuel came and anointed him
[24:44] if he rejected it
[24:48] if you would have said no well I'm not
[24:50] adequate to be a king
[24:53] oh that's not who I was intended to be
[24:57] I want to go do this or that amen
[25:00] David would have lived his life never
[25:03] truly knowing who he was intended
[25:08] amen Samuel could appreciate time and
[25:10] time again to him
[25:12] Samuel could appreciate that time and
[25:13] time again soon
[25:18] but I wouldn't have done him any good
[25:20] unless he believed in himself
[25:24] and in our case
[25:27] the preacher can come and tell us
[25:32] but it comes down to if we believe it
[25:36] that you are who God says
[25:42] to want to be a Christian
[25:46] but to do what a Christian does
[25:50] and then I want to share a quote real
[25:53] quick from Brother Branham
[25:55] it's in the message has the Lord spoken
[25:58] only to Moses
[26:04] and it says like this it is but now
[26:09] we can't expect the gospel of Christ to
[26:11] be popular
[26:14] now the gospel this is not the gospel
[26:20] this is part of the Gospel
[26:23] said the word
[26:26] the gospel evangelio came not in word
[26:29] only
[26:32] through Power and manifestation of the
[26:34] Holy Ghost
[26:36] manifestation
[26:38] is that right the gospel is not the word
[26:45] the word's just a dead letter
[26:48] it's got to take the letter Quicken
[26:53] and made alive and brought to pass
[26:57] what the letter says
[27:01] that's the gospel
[27:03] in other words with brother Brandon is
[27:05] trying to bring him
[27:07] is that it's not enough to hear the Gods
[27:12] amen I believe that brother is God Jesus
[27:15] didn't just call us to preach the gospel
[27:17] amen
[27:19] he called us to be the gospel
[27:23] amen and a lot of people grow tired of
[27:26] hearing the gospel priests behind the
[27:28] pope personas
[27:31] and that's understandable yes because
[27:35] anyone can come up here
[27:37] whether it's a male or a female it's
[27:39] really easy yes
[27:42] but I believe that's why brother Branham
[27:44] always said
[27:45] he said don't Don't Preach me a good
[27:48] sermon
[27:49] he said leave me one amen
[27:53] amen amen
[27:55] praise be to God
[27:57] I'm going to go ahead and read here in
[27:59] the Book of James chapter one
[28:02] Santiago UNO verse 22.
[28:07] verse
[28:08] it says like this it says but be ye
[28:12] doers of the word
[28:14] and not hears only deceiving your own
[28:16] selves
[28:26] sorry boss only in English
[29:02] we cause ourselves to believe something
[29:04] that's not true
[29:08] when we only hear the word
[29:11] we fail to admit to ourselves that this
[29:14] word and this message is
[29:18] amen because when we only hear the word
[29:20] we call ourselves to forget Who We Are
[29:23] we cause ourselves to forget who we are
[29:25] when we okay
[29:29] I mean I can't recall the countless
[29:31] times
[29:33] that I hear an amazing sermon
[29:37] and then I leave church and I forget
[29:40] what it was about
[29:42] amen I hope I'm not alone
[29:46] amen amen if you continue on to verse 23
[29:49] this is foreign
[29:56] and not a doer he's likened to a man
[29:59] beholding his natural face in a glass
[30:04] for he beholdeth himself
[30:07] sorry go ahead is
[30:15] where he beholds himself and goeth his
[30:17] way straight away forgetth what manner
[30:20] of man he was
[30:25] amen there's only one true mirror we
[30:27] have on this Earth there's only one way
[30:29] there's only one true mirror
[30:35] if we really want to see who we are
[30:38] and we want to identify ourselves we
[30:44] ought to look in the word amen
[30:47] amen the rest of what we try and see
[30:49] ourselves as
[30:52] well we compare ourselves as
[30:55] it's all paintings and pictures of
[30:58] something else amen
[31:01] I can hold up a picture of someone else
[31:05] I can hold up a picture of my brother
[31:19] a lot of times God is trying to tell us
[31:21] that we are who we say we are right
[31:27] God wants to show us who we truly are
[31:30] most
[31:32] amen if my brother can't get ready I'm
[31:35] going to be closing
[31:37] verse 25 of the Book of James
[31:42] it says like this but who so looketh
[31:45] into the perfect law of Liberty it
[31:48] continues therein he being not a
[31:50] forgetful hear but a doer of the work
[31:52] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[31:54] myself
[32:07] amen if you take that last piece it says
[32:10] that this man shall be blessed in his
[32:12] deeds
[32:17] I mean you see this very thing that
[32:19] happened in David's life
[32:23] and in verse 10 that we read
[32:26] it said I'm going to go ahead and
[32:28] summarize it pretty much says
[32:31] David grew great because God was with
[32:33] him
[32:35] so then if I can leave you with anything
[32:39] I'll leave you with this
[32:41] if you stay with God
[32:43] and if you stay with his words
[32:52] thank you
[32:54] [Applause]
[33:06] [Music]
[33:08] God bless your brother Diego
[33:12] he's a young man that is
[33:21] on paper yes
[33:30] [Music]
[33:45] Sarah
[33:50] is special
[33:56] on this
[34:02] Mountain this mountain Syrian those that
[34:07] went out
[34:08] and those that went up with David
[34:11] were giant Killers
[34:20] or giant Killers
[34:35] I would give their lives for David
[34:41] how many men and women do we have here
[34:43] foreign
[35:19] or the association of an alliance over
[35:21] Association
[35:23] now notice this is
[35:26] a place of a pactory covenant
[35:31] now people many people get stuck here
[35:34] because they don't like to make a call
[35:37] many people don't like to give us
[35:44] let's just get together
[35:47] you go your way I'll go my way
[35:50] they don't make a covenant
[35:54] but once you make a covenant
[36:02] making a covenant
[36:05] David
[36:22] that's a covenant
[36:25] when you come to church
[36:27] that's when you accepted
[36:43] I made a covenant with him
[36:53] in a covenant with my God
[36:58] amen
[37:04] that's why many people don't want a
[37:06] covenant
[37:09] many people don't want to be engaged
[37:11] yeah that's the same thing in church
[37:16] they listen to a nice sermon
[37:18] and then they go home and what did he do
[37:22] with that nada nothing yeah
[37:30] but how are you going to live with him
[37:33] what have you done for the kingdom what
[37:36] have we done
[37:57] oh Brothers
[38:01] this is
[38:07] now a covenant the meaning is a treaty
[38:09] between two or more parties that agreed
[38:12] to comply with the pre the with the
[38:14] provision Association now an association
[38:18] a union the individuals of individuals
[38:22] with a specific purpose
[38:27] when you come to church and you unite
[38:31] yourself here
[38:33] is
[38:35] now we're all pointing
[38:38] to a special place now
[38:42] we all points and are going
[38:46] to a specific or special place
[38:50] now where are we going brother vamos
[38:53] where are we going
[38:55] we're gonna go to be with the King
[39:00] to go towards the king
[39:03] minimum
[39:05] yeah
[39:09] now I want to give some key notes I want
[39:12] to talk about
[39:13] then I'm going to pass the Baton until
[39:15] my brother Vidal
[39:18] now on Hebron
[39:22] here it teaches us or shows us
[39:27] God adds on to David
[39:30] ministerio de David God adds on to
[39:33] David's Ministry El Pueblo the people
[39:35] now the people
[39:39] David
[39:48] you want to know why because he lived
[39:52] here what he said
[39:57] when the people started
[40:02] a small sword good appearing guy
[40:06] who's not just a talker is
[40:11] and the Beautiful part about it is that
[40:13] God was with David
[40:27] an unconditional Covenant
[40:30] hello
[40:37] that Covenant was with them yes
[40:40] and that same convenience with us
[40:43] with you and I
[41:39] there was three
[42:02] and these fellows
[42:53] and said for you oh David and with you
[42:56] oh son of Jesse peace peace with you and
[42:59] peace with your helpers
[43:03] it says now look it says peace with you
[43:06] and peace with your helpers
[43:10] how beautiful that is
[43:39] what this man was doing
[43:41] he said that it says that he saw
[43:45] and he himself
[43:48] but he recognized
[43:51] that Jehovah was with David
[43:53] oh Brothers
[43:55] what beautiful it would be
[43:58] that we would recognize
[44:01] when God is with them
[44:04] with the woman
[44:15] that's very tremendous
[44:23] I'm going to be closing up now
[44:28] there's a loyalty and then there's a
[44:31] covenant

[49:54] more and the essence is love and
[49:59] this shall you fulfill all the
[50:01] Commandments
[50:04] that we love one another
[50:08] God bless you Brothers
[50:10] [Applause]
[50:16] uh if you were just open your uh Bibles
[50:20] to the book of First Corinthians chapter
[50:22] 13.
[50:24] I will be reading verse 4.
[50:28] we'll be reading verse seven
[50:32] it's good to see everybody in the house
[50:34] of the Lord
[50:35] everybody that visits us
[50:38] and those that are watching through the
[50:39] internet
[50:41] and may the Lord bless you you know what
[50:43] I think brother uh brother uh Diego and
[50:46] brother Fidel
[50:48] and bringing the great word that they
[50:50] brought
[50:52] the word of the Lord says like this
[50:56] charity suffers long and is kind
[50:59] charity envious not charity vonteth not
[51:03] itself is not El Amores
[51:12] it says bear with all things
[51:15] believeth all things hope is all things
[51:18] endures all things
[51:23] you service
[51:26] I really enjoy our preaching to the
[51:28] youth uh
[51:30] you know they're they're very special to
[51:32] me
[51:33] so I always I feel like a young man
[51:35] still myself
[51:38] amen amen every time I'm around to me
[51:40] you know you just kind of get that
[51:41] energy
[51:44] and last as long as they do anymore
[51:46] except okay
[51:48] you can stay up all night
[51:51] we can't do that anymore
[51:54] amen amen but the word of the Lord says
[51:57] uh we're uh I just kind of want to focus
[52:00] on uh on on love above all things
[52:05] you know I was kind of watching
[52:08] something
[52:09] I was I I watched something it was like
[52:11] a short clip
[52:15] and uh you know uh the guy says
[52:17] something I really liked
[52:19] you know we're going from uh you know
[52:22] the boys are going from from from being
[52:24] a youth you know to a transition to a
[52:26] man Los Muchachos
[52:30] I said Hombres no that's that's the goal
[52:33] anyway
[52:34] you know we we want that okay
[52:37] oh because one of the things that
[52:39] disqualifies you from the the priesthood
[52:41] is to stay in a dwarf but
[52:47] you know we don't want any dwarfs here
[52:49] in the church
[52:51] we want to reach the statue of a perfect
[52:53] man
[52:55] we want the young ladies
[52:58] the young ladies to to become women
[53:03] that's the goal
[53:05] amen amen you know uh but you know the I
[53:09] was watching uh what it said and it said
[53:11] you know uh the difference what's the
[53:13] difference between uh between a grown
[53:16] male and a man at Starbucks
[53:25] you know and uh I was uh and the guy
[53:29] goes on and he says
[53:31] he's like you know the grown male
[53:36] you know he uh the
[53:40] the the grown male
[53:42] he uh what he does is is he actually has
[53:45] the the suit of a of a man
[53:51] that's right he's like and uh you know
[53:55] so he dresses like the like the man
[53:57] hombre
[54:00] it's like but what the grown male does
[54:07] that he uh
[54:09] he expects everybody to serve him
[54:13] he wants everybody to serve them
[54:17] you see but uh the real man
[54:21] what he does is he tries to serve
[54:23] located
[54:25] that's what a real man does
[54:28] he's not waiting for somebody to come
[54:30] you know to do something
[54:33] in order to do something for him oh but
[54:37] a real man
[54:38] you know he's he's he just he's at the
[54:41] service of anybody that needs help
[54:45] you know and I believe that that's the
[54:47] kind of uh that's the kind of person
[54:49] that David was
[54:51] you see uh David you know we we want to
[54:54] like like Diego was saying
[54:56] you know he just he just did what he had
[54:58] to do
[55:00] you just handled business
[55:04] you know we can't just talk about it
[55:09] to be about it
[55:11] you know that's what I believe that's
[55:13] okay okay we can't just talk about the
[55:15] guys
[55:24] amen amen you know if you know this is
[55:29] you know David could have taken
[55:31] different uh you do because success gets
[55:33] to your head pretty quick
[55:37] you know they're actually a success
[55:39] actually has a sister
[55:45] that's right you know so if you're not
[55:48] careful
[55:49] you know ego can step right in
[55:53] there's a lot of times
[55:58] and you think you're the best thing that
[56:01] ever happened in the face of this Earth
[56:09] what
[57:00] [Music]
[57:09] and you will come to a fork in the road
[57:18] this is
[57:22] using his hands to illustrate
[57:27] boy it marks off these two directions
[57:32] he says if you go that way
[57:37] he says you will have to make you have
[57:40] to make compromises
[57:42] and you will have to turn your back on
[57:45] your friends
[57:47] but you will be a member of the club
[57:52] and you will get promoted
[57:55] you will get good assignments
[58:03] just to make the alternative clearer
[58:09] he said you can go that way
[58:13] and you can do something
[58:16] you can do something
[58:18] you see a lot of people
[58:55] he says this is
[59:00] he says you can go that way and you can
[59:02] do something
[59:04] for your country
[59:06] that's something for your Air Force and
[59:09] for yourself
[59:12] if you decide what you and you want to
[59:15] do something
[59:17] because you may not get promoted
[59:20] you may not get the good assignment
[59:23] and you certainly will not be a favorite
[59:25] of your superiors
[59:28] it says but you won't have to compromise
[59:31] yourself
[59:32] because you will be true to your friends
[59:44] being more more important than being
[59:46] true to your friends
[59:50] and being true to yourself
[59:57] that's the important thing is
[59:59] it's important to be true to your
[1:00:02] friends
[1:00:09] standard
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:01:27] don't just try to be
[1:01:30] David wasn't just he didn't want to just
[1:01:32] be a king
[1:01:36] that was not in his mind
[1:01:39] he was just trying to do what God told
[1:01:42] him
[1:01:46] little did he know
[1:01:50] you know he just as time began to pass
[1:01:55] you see it and you know he just had all
[1:01:57] these victories
[1:01:59] he didn't know that he was actually
[1:02:01] doing the work of a king
[1:02:04] you see but it was all foreign
[1:02:54] I got the shoes you want
[1:02:58] the dress didn't quite fit the right way
[1:03:00] you wanted
[1:03:02] and you know you may not have got the
[1:03:04] car you wanted
[1:03:07] but it's always about you
[1:03:09] know
[1:03:17] anybody else is
[1:03:23] you're just in your own world
[1:03:39] I am here
[1:03:44] okay foreign
[1:03:56] is starting to do something
[1:03:59] amen amen
[1:04:03] and that and that's every day yes so as
[1:04:06] the audio
[1:04:07] we have to uh constantly
[1:04:12] fight
[1:04:13] against our cause
[1:04:16] against our cause
[1:04:19] that's right we have to fight against it
[1:04:23] because if not it just takes over
[1:04:27] and then you're not fighting for God's
[1:04:29] cause anymore
[1:04:31] you're fighting for yours
[1:04:41] the dirt to just build up out there in
[1:04:44] the kitchen la
[1:04:49] Cocina you know you just don't sweep it

[1:04:53] you know men sweep too I'm sure
[1:05:01] get that broom every once in a while
[1:05:04] and you know you gotta sweep every day
[1:05:12] you didn't sweep every day
[1:05:15] oh you know that dust would get up get
[1:05:18] so bad

[1:05:22] a whole lot
[1:05:24] you know you start getting allergies
[1:05:27] season all over the place
[1:05:38] that you're of that's not allowing you
[1:05:41] to see
[1:05:44] the the greater cause
[1:06:33] he's fighting for the kids
[1:06:36] oh
[1:07:29] mobile

[1:09:19] do all these things
[1:09:24] David David he never doubted
[1:09:27] he didn't doubt in his God
[1:09:30] he never doubted the promise
[1:09:32] he knew what was promised
[1:09:37] that it was only temporary
[1:09:40] the suffering
[1:09:43] only temporary
[1:09:45] amen amen we just want everything so
[1:09:48] fast a lot of times

[1:09:54] pain

[1:11:02] get recognition
[1:11:05] this world may not recognize
[1:11:08] the world that the people didn't know
[1:11:10] that David was going to be their King
[1:11:13] they were persecuting him but they were
[1:11:17] trying to kill him
