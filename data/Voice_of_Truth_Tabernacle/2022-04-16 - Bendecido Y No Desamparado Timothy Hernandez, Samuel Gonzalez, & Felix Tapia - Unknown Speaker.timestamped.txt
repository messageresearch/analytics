[28:50] happy to be here once again amen
[28:55] amen
[29:23] when you have it can you say amen
[29:31] i want to thank our beloved pastor for
[29:32] giving me the privilege
[29:35] and trust he's interested in me
[29:38] is
[29:47] and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his
[29:49] father was a stranger in the land of
[29:50] canaan
[30:11] these are the generations of jacob
[30:13] joseph being 17 years old was feeling
[30:16] was feeding the flock
[30:17] with his brethren and the lad was with
[30:20] the sons of
[30:22] bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his
[30:24] father's wives and joseph brought into
[30:27] his father their evil report
[30:31] is
[30:41] i want you to pay close attention to
[30:43] verse three now israel loved joseph more
[30:45] than all his children because he was a
[30:47] son of his old age and he made him a
[30:50] coat of many colors
[31:02] and when his brothers saw that their
[31:04] father loved him more than all his
[31:05] brethren they hated him and could not
[31:08] speak peaceably unto him amen
[31:11] amen
[31:16] your heavenly
[31:34] like the song that our brothers and
[31:35] sisters were singing earlier
[31:39] we place this service in your hands
[31:41] and help us amen amen
[31:44] may be seated
[31:50] how many of you know that jose had that
[31:52] joseph had seven brothers
[31:57] joseph was born brother
[32:10] because he was born of his old age
[32:39] [Music]
[32:53] was inspired in the supernatural way
[33:00] that we are inspired
[33:04] we have this visa
[33:07] amen how many can say he
[33:24] jose that they were jealous of joseph
[33:27] jose
[33:29] in the message joseph meeting with his
[33:31] brothers
[33:36] jose
[34:04] never did joseph ever cope with them he
[34:06] was hated and rejected for the same
[34:07] purpose that the rest of them were
[34:09] because god was with him in the
[34:11] supernatural way and in a different way
[34:13] that was in a different way than what he
[34:16] was with the rest of them and they hated
[34:18] him without a cause
[34:21] he hated him without a cause jesus
[34:25] jesus hated without a cost
[34:30] and we can see nowadays
[34:44] amen amen
[34:46] you know he
[35:14] uh
[35:17] and at that moment that's when their
[35:18] brother his brothers wanted to kill
[35:19] joseph
[35:22] but they're in that moment
[35:24] espanol
[35:26] correcto okay
[36:38] explains
[37:20] i
[37:34] on the other side
[37:59] if god can do something on a youth like
[38:01] joseph
[38:16] amen
[38:43] and let me tell you that courage
[38:47] to stand firm with god
[38:51] foreign
[38:53] not going to do that
[38:55] and john says
[38:58] she
[39:26] but in reality
[39:41] amen
[39:42] amen amen
[39:53] christian 53.
[40:09] walks after spiritual things
[40:12] to the world its carnal mind is
[40:14] necessary it's foolishness
[40:19] [Music]
[40:20] it's everlasting
[40:22] there
[41:05] [Music]
[41:16] one side of him
[41:17] he had
[41:32] one of your own brothers
[42:18] [Applause]
[42:28] my
[43:23] the last the last paragraph
[43:37] cristo
[43:53] shall be taken
[43:55] some of these days

[46:28] beautiful tonight
[46:31] he could please stand up for a moment
[46:37] i appreciate every one of you tonight
[46:42] like to give thanks to my pastor tito
[46:43] and jesus christ
[46:46] you're giving me the trust to be here
[46:51] with truly a blessing to be here yes
[46:55] right away if you please open your
[46:56] bibles to genesis 37.
[47:03] you have me please
[47:06] man
[47:11] and it says like this
[47:14] now israel loved joseph more than all
[47:16] his children
[47:21] because he was the son of his old age
[47:26] and he made him a coat of many colors
[47:30] along without like to include a verse
[47:33] including
[47:34] which i think personally is a key verse
[47:36] for me okay
[47:50] and it says like this
[47:53] but as for you
[47:59] ye thought evil against me mal contra me
[48:02] but god meant it unto good ma
[48:21] i have the privilege
[48:23] along with my brother timothy and my
[48:25] brother felix
[48:27] timothy romano felix just
[48:29] introduced the new bible character
[48:32] persona
[48:41] amen tonight i want to speak about the
[48:44] life of joseph
[49:02] you know joseph was a special born boy
[49:04] josef
[49:07] special to his father
[49:09] especially
[49:11] you see joseph was the youngest of all
[49:13] his brothers jose
[49:14] almost
[49:36] you see joseph as the youngest brother
[49:38] jose
[49:39] ellerman
[49:41] you know he took care of the sheep of
[49:42] his father
[49:52] and here we can see how special joseph
[49:54] was to jacob yeah
[50:06] gave joseph a co of many colors a robe
[50:09] jacob is
[50:13] and i believe i truly believe
[50:16] that jacob didn't give that to him
[50:20] not just because he was the favorite no
[50:22] solo
[50:23] preference i believe that the reason
[50:25] jacob gave that to josephus
[50:29] jose is because he saw something special
[50:32] especially
[50:33] he could not see in the other brothers
[50:36] he saw something different
[51:05] no he gets sold as a slave to egypt i
[51:08] love anthony
[51:10] you know there he works for potiphar
[51:14] general of egypt
[51:16] and there he is tempted
[51:19] no he's tempted there
[51:34] because of that he was sent into prison
[51:38] you know and there god granted him the
[51:40] gift of interpreting dreams
[51:44] and you know because of that joseph was
[51:46] the right-hand man
[52:02] that god always fulfills his promises
[52:05] so even if it doesn't seem like it
[52:08] even if it seems like the enemy is
[52:10] winning
[52:13] if it seems like god forgot about us
[52:30] always with joseph
[52:53] [Music]
[52:56] god will fulfill every promise
[53:12] god
[53:39] and you know that's why we identify
[53:40] ourselves with joseph sometimes
[53:42] identification
[53:44] you see in the life of joseph
[53:46] jose we could see an example for each
[53:49] and every one of us
[53:52] example for us
[54:06] even though all the things the brothers
[54:08] have done to him
[54:12] in the end
[54:15] look at joseph jose and his capacity for
[54:18] forgiveness
[54:21] look at joseph jose
[54:49] you see when when
[54:51] the world was under a famine a famine
[54:57] during that time
[54:59] you know how was israel how was the city
[55:01] of israel saved comfort salvador
[55:42] foreign
[56:00] amen i'm amen
[56:01] you see when i see the life of joseph
[56:05] i see grace
[56:07] just like our brother timothy
[56:09] timothy you see grace manifested in the
[56:11] life
[56:13] of jose you know in genesis 37
[56:17] i'm not going to read it
[56:19] genesis 37 20 is shows
[56:23] that his brothers
[56:26] you know they were plotting to kill him
[56:27] established
[56:53] you see the grace of god
[56:58] you see in genesis 37 26.
[57:02] it shows that reuben
[57:05] no he wasn't there
[57:07] and once again the brothers start
[57:08] plotting
[57:41] [Music]
[57:51] wherever he was
[58:06] preached in 1962
[58:10] and it says like this
[58:13] look at joseph
[58:14] jose born among his brethren
[58:18] hatred of his brothers
[58:32] sold for pretty near 30 pieces of silver
[58:34] portrait
[58:58] and he was taken up from this ditch
[59:02] and went and sat
[59:16] at the
[59:44] to return to
[59:59] one more time how we could go through
[1:00:00] the problem
[1:00:02] and show that that was really the spirit
[1:00:04] of it
[1:00:06] oh christ the christian
[1:00:09] prophet
[1:00:10] do you believe that
[1:00:12] see
[1:00:54] you see if it wasn't for joseph's office
[1:00:59] you wouldn't have saved all those people
[1:01:02] was it for jesus
[1:01:05] we wouldn't be here right now
[1:01:08] there's always a person
[1:01:34] and when he says
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:03:14] are you going to go towards
[1:03:25] there's going to be something good in
[1:03:26] the end
[1:03:28] there's going to be
[1:03:56] god
[1:04:05] god bless you brothers and sisters
[1:04:08] we're happy to be here
[1:04:10] brother
[1:04:19] we have to train them like there will be
[1:04:21] of tomorrow
[1:04:24] if not then for today
[1:04:38] you know i admire that so much
[1:04:41] because the world has so many things to
[1:04:42] offer
[1:04:45] but you know but they made the choice to
[1:04:47] be here
[1:04:49] and serve the lord with other hearts
[1:04:53] if you can turn your your bibles to
[1:04:54] genesis 37 4.
[1:05:05] we thank god for the for the opportunity
[1:05:15] um
[1:05:20] it says like this it says that when his
[1:05:22] brethren saw that their father loved him
[1:05:25] more than all his brethren
[1:05:27] they hated him and could not speak
[1:05:29] peaceably unto him
[1:05:46] you know i'm going to be talking about
[1:05:47] joseph again well
[1:06:01] because on a day like today
[1:06:13] see joseph was loved by his father josef
[1:06:17] and he was hated and he was hated by his
[1:06:19] brothers
[1:06:21] because he was different
[1:06:24] he was different like in a supernatural
[1:06:25] way
[1:06:29] you know he was more spiritual than his
[1:06:31] brothers
[1:06:34] and his brothers did it hated him
[1:06:36] without a cause
[1:06:41] you know they tried to kill him
[1:06:44] you know and they threw him in a ditch
[1:06:48] and they left them for dead
[1:06:51] you know but god had grace on him
[1:06:55] and let him live
[1:06:58] you know and he was picked up by slave
[1:06:59] traders
[1:07:05] you know and he was sold for almost 30
[1:07:07] pieces of silver
[1:07:11] you know i believe it was around 20 what
[1:07:13] the bible says
[1:07:18] and just like jesus christ was sold for
[1:07:20] 30 pieces of silver jesus
[1:07:24] brother branham says that joseph
[1:07:26] jose
[1:07:39] the same as jesus christ
[1:07:42] and if we bring it to the church on
[1:07:44] today
[1:07:46] and we bring it to today's christianity
[1:07:50] you know we are hated by the world as
[1:07:52] well
[1:08:07] you know sometimes we're seen as a
[1:08:09] little crazy a little weird
[1:08:15] you know and i know sometimes it's hard
[1:08:19] and i put myself there
[1:08:22] you know it's hard for me to to to not
[1:08:24] like the things of this world
[1:08:28] you know because that's the nature of
[1:08:29] this flesh
[1:08:32] it's the nature to to fall to the things
[1:08:34] of this world
[1:08:46] don't fall to the things of the world
[1:08:50] you know
[1:08:51] it doesn't matter if they don't love you
[1:08:54] you know like i said this before
[1:08:57] you know we were not saying here to be
[1:08:58] loved by the world
[1:09:02] but to show the world what is
[1:09:18] you know i love them so much
[1:09:21] how could they do this to me
[1:09:24] but you know when he was picked up
[1:09:27] you know he was sent to egypt
[1:09:30] you know and he it was at that time it
[1:09:32] was the biggest commercial cd in the
[1:09:34] world
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:40] and he he moved up quickly
[1:09:46] you know in in before he he you had to
[1:09:49] get through him
[1:09:52] and
[1:09:53] enter the palace but
[1:09:55] you know you have to get to him
[1:10:00] you know and even though in his lowest
[1:10:02] point
[1:10:04] you know god was with him
[1:10:07] and he was with him in every moment
[1:10:10] even to the point when he was in his
[1:10:12] highest point
[1:10:15] you know god was still with him
[1:10:18] you know god god never left them
[1:10:21] it didn't matter how the devil tried to
[1:10:23] destroy him
[1:10:27] but he couldn't destroy that seed that
[1:10:28] was in him
[1:10:32] you know because god was always with him
[1:10:35] and god is always with us
[1:10:38] on a day like today like i said earlier
[1:10:42] or more than 2 000 years ago
[1:10:45] jesus christ surrendered everything so
[1:10:47] he can be with us
[1:10:52] he was crucified in the cross
[1:10:56] he was sold for 30 pieces of silver
[1:10:59] portraying
[1:11:00] plata and when he was on his way to be
[1:11:02] crucified in the cross
[1:11:05] crucificado you know people were
[1:11:07] spitting at him like
[1:11:09] people were probably throwing things at
[1:11:11] him
[1:11:13] you know he just had probably gotten the
[1:11:14] biggest whipping that anybody can think
[1:11:16] of
[1:11:20] he was b
[1:11:22] you know he he
[1:11:24] i'm pretty sure at that moment
[1:11:28] he probably wanted to give up
[1:11:31] you know he wanted to say i can't do
[1:11:32] this
[1:11:35] you know he could have probably sent
[1:11:36] archangels at that moment
[1:11:57] you know he was thinking about us in
[1:11:58] that moment
[1:12:01] it didn't matter how how painful that
[1:12:02] was
[1:12:06] and when they crucified him equando le
[1:12:08] crucificaron he said father forgive them
[1:12:13] for they don't know what they do
[1:12:16] you know in that moment
[1:12:18] you know the devil probably thought el
[1:12:20] diablo
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:32] you know but at the end right before he
[1:12:34] passed away
[1:12:38] you know before he surrendered the
[1:12:39] spirit he died
[1:12:41] and he said it is finished
[1:12:45] and he went
[1:12:46] you know what brothers he went
[1:13:53] and at that moment
[1:13:56] he poured his whole spirit into the
[1:13:58] church
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:05] and he said i'm going to be with my
[1:14:06] children in every moment
[1:14:12] you know god is with us in every moment
[1:14:16] and just like and there is nothing that
[1:14:18] can destroy us
[1:14:22] you know god is with us esta
[1:14:26] conosotros in every moment
[1:14:34] you know we might not see him
[1:14:37] maybe we can't touch him
[1:14:39] but he is with us in a supernatural way
[1:14:50] max luciano once said
[1:15:21] they try to destroy our spiritual life
[1:15:24] spiritual they may tell us you know why
[1:15:26] are you going to church
[1:15:30] you know you'll find better happiness
[1:15:31] out in the world
[1:15:35] you know maybe you you'll be better out
[1:15:37] there
[1:15:40] you know but god is with us even when
[1:15:42] we're fighting sicknesses
[1:15:46] and they're trying to destroy us
[1:15:50] you know i
[1:15:52] i came from a place
[1:15:55] you know where i was addicted from drugs
[1:16:00] you know i was addicted to many
[1:16:01] different things
[1:16:04] are different
[1:16:05] you know and god always tried to destroy
[1:16:07] me
[1:16:14] and the devil always tried to destroy me
[1:16:19] you know but god was always there with
[1:16:21] me
[1:16:24] you know it didn't matter how far you go
[1:16:25] down
[1:16:30] you know god is always there with you yo
[1:16:33] it doesn't matter what tries to destroy
[1:16:35] you
[1:16:39] god is the only thing we need
[1:16:43] when we don't have friends
[1:16:45] amigos he is the friend that is there
[1:16:50] when we lose everything
[1:16:53] and everything may seem destroyed
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:58] god is there with us yo
[1:17:13] and it doesn't matter what tries to
[1:17:14] destroy you
[1:17:17] and i i i look at joseph
[1:17:19] jose you know what every way he was
[1:17:22] almost destroyed
[1:17:27] you know he tried his brothers trying to
[1:17:28] destroy him
[1:17:31] uh part of that's wife tried to destroy
[1:17:33] him
[1:17:36] and and uh and the buzz
[1:17:40] butler tried to destroy him
[1:17:42] you know and god was still with him in
[1:17:44] that moment
[1:17:48] you know god never left his side
[1:17:52] you know and god will never abandon us
[1:18:23] you know and i believe that god has
[1:18:25] shown you
[1:18:27] outstead you know when you don't feel
[1:18:29] like giving up

[1:19:01] going to help me read hebrews 13 5 and

[1:19:17] let your conversation be without
[1:19:19] covetness and be content with such
[1:19:21] things as you have
[1:19:22] for he has said i will never leave thee
[1:19:24] nor forsake thee
[1:19:46] so that we may boldly say the lord is my
[1:19:49] helper and i will not fear what man
[1:19:51] shall do unto me.

[1:20:43] that is god speaking to your
[1:20:58] because there is nothing that can
[1:21:00] destroy you absolutely
