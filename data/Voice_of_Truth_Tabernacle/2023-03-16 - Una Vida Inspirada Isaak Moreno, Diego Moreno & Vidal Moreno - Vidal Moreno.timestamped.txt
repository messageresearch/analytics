[15:14] Wednesdays
[15:17] because maybe it's not something that
[15:18] brings so much emotions but it's
[15:21] something that our souls need to hear
[15:23] and it helps us in our daily walk
[15:27] it shows us who we are

[22:40] God called her home to be with him
[22:43] yesterday
[22:45] she was with us here for a time
[22:49] so we consider a part of this
[22:51] congregation
[22:53] and we are we're happy
[22:55] for the life that she lived
[22:58] and the example she gave is
[23:05] I believe it also goes with what we are
[23:07] speaking
[23:09] about the patience the
[23:13] and then there like well understanding
[23:17] the the stage that we are in desperate
[23:22] to go wake up to the moment that we're
[23:25] living in
[23:28] sometimes we're so occupied
[23:31] in doing things that we don't we don't
[23:36] detain ourselves we don't stop we don't
[23:38] stop
[23:39] to think
[23:43] what we're if we're doing really matters
[23:47] our mind is so occupied doing things
[23:52] that if we don't stop
[23:55] and analyze our lives
[23:58] and we ask and
[24:00] all this is
[24:04] am I truly doing what really matters
[24:07] because if not one day
[24:09] we will realize
[24:11] we might have
[24:14] that
[24:16] it was not worth it
[24:20] Lord
[24:56] paying attention
[24:59] to what you want me to do Anton says

[28:13] in One Way or Another you treated her
[28:15] well

[28:36] of her
[28:38] I just share this
[28:44] so you just know the caliber of of of
[28:47] women that you were speaking of is
[28:50] this happened in 1997.
[28:54] when my father passed away
[28:57] I remember
[29:04] they were difficult times
[29:08] for for me as a person
[29:11] since my father passed away
[29:16] I remember it was very cloudy it was a
[29:19] hurricane many people passed away
[29:23] and one of the things that impacted me
[29:26] of my my grandmother is this that I will
[29:30] share with you yes she suffered very
[29:32] much
[29:34] she was a mistreated
[29:37] by her husband
[29:40] in many ways
[29:45] she was mistreated yeah
[29:52] her husband had a
[29:55] a
[29:57] lovers in the same around the same place
[30:01] where she lived
[30:07] I would be his mother
[30:13] in one place
[30:25] a little bit higher than that
[30:31] my grandmother or my grandmother would
[30:34] see my my grandfather just go by
[30:37] and he would see her she would see him
[30:39] go by with with his lover
[30:44] that's what she was very saying
[30:49] position
[30:54] [Music]
[30:56] but one of the things that impacted
[31:00] when my father passed away I remember
[31:06] we're going up a little higher when my
[31:08] father lived up in the area where we
[31:10] lived
[31:15] and my grandmother and I even most
[31:18] famous
[31:22] [Music]
[31:23] and where the hurricane went through and
[31:26] everything is
[31:29] a lot of water going through the streets
[31:35] the water was very strong and I remember
[31:39] as if it was yesterday
[31:43] I was very young
[31:50] a person was coming towards
[31:55] and it was the mother of our brother
[31:57] adelpho
[31:59] IR I remember
[32:04] that she approaches
[32:06] now remember
[32:12] a lot due to that
[32:16] and that lady approached my grandma
[32:18] and my grandmother approached her and I
[32:22] remember
[32:23] my grandmother asked her for forgiveness
[32:51] that has been mistreated
[32:53] is
[33:26] [Music]
[33:57] I
[33:59] want to thank everybody

[35:15] thanking our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:19] for giving me the opportunity
[35:22] the great privilege and honor
[35:28] Ado
[35:30] to be able to be raised in a home of a
[35:33] daughter of God
[35:37] when you are happy with being familiar
[35:41] raised in a rich family
[35:46] or maybe Sons or Daughters of a king
[35:53] I'm happy to have been raised there
[35:55] where a son and daughter of God was
[35:59] I want to thank my lord for that
[36:03] I think the people that
[36:08] a smile
[36:13] a hug
[36:19] when she was here with us
[36:24] to thank you for that
[36:26] um
[36:29] we're very close to her you know yes
[36:33] one of them was our sister
[36:37] I want to thank her for what she did for
[36:39] my grandmother
[36:41] I'd like to thank my wife
[36:54] she wanted to go to Disneyland
[36:59] my uh my wife she took the time and took
[37:02] her to Disneyland
[37:04] and I want to thank you for what you did
[37:07] for her
[37:12] I'd like to read a scripture
[37:15] in the Book of Revelation
[37:17] 21 verse 4. this is the scripture says
[37:22] like this
[37:29] foreign
[37:41] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[37:44] their eyes and there shall be no more
[37:45] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[37:47] shall there be any more pain for the
[37:49] former things are passed away
[37:51] um
[37:52] my grandmother margarita
[37:56] Corazon she had a great heart
[38:27] and
[38:31] she adopted us as her own children
[38:34] she loved us
[38:46] to take care of her children
[39:03] a little girl yeah
[39:08] I remember a little a little girl a
[39:10] little baby
[39:12] she adopted her as her own
[39:16] she raised her ass and she loved her
[39:23] he
[39:25] is
[39:26] our uh our sister Rocio
[39:31] she had such a great heart
[39:34] okay
[39:36] foreign
[40:10] that she could raise us
[40:15] she didn't Prosper because
[40:18] if she saw somebody that was in need
[40:21] she would always let them borrow
[40:24] or she would just give it to them
[40:29] that's why she didn't prosper in
[40:31] business
[40:32] she was a great woman
[40:40] her last days
[40:44] the ones that were around her
[40:48] would be able they were able to see the
[40:51] angel of the Lord
[40:53] before her
[40:57] and that confirms
[41:03] she was the daughter of God
[41:06] when she was asked
[41:09] she was ready to go with the Lord
[41:12] so it's not a single doubt in her heart
[41:15] she said I'm ready
[41:19] foreign
[41:34] she was a great example for me
[41:38] um
[41:39] as my brother said
[41:43] if we are here today
[41:45] is
[41:48] because one day a woman like her stood
[41:51] up for God
[41:54] and as Paul told Timothy a circle
[42:00] as I saw of faith in that woman that was
[42:03] not that was not a
[42:07] fake
[42:09] energy
[42:11] and and that woman was that type of
[42:13] thing
[42:14] a faith that was not uh may the Lord
[42:18] bless you
[42:20] [Applause]
[42:26] foreign
[42:31] [Applause]
[42:41] the Bible says we have a great cloud of
[42:44] witnesses that encourages
[42:49] keep going it can be done
[42:53] why could you are going to be able to as
[42:55] well
[42:58] that encourages us
[43:01] to continue fighting the good fight and
[43:04] finish the race
[43:05] almost uh
[43:07] let's change it up a little bit
[43:13] we're going to enter into the Sardis
[43:15] Church
[43:17] Revelation 3 1 once again
[43:21] we're in the fifth Church
[43:24] the fifth Church
[43:28] the age of Sardis
[43:32] the time of the Reformation
[43:36] the time of Martin Luther
[43:39] where the Protestants were born
[43:43] and the seed that was founded by this
[43:45] nation
[43:47] that this nation created
[43:51] that created this that created this
[43:53] nation
[43:54] is
[44:04] and unto the angel of the church and
[44:06] Sardis right these things said he the
[44:08] the hath the seven spirits of God
[44:13] uh
[44:20] I want to focus on the seven Messengers
[44:22] in the seven spirits this evening
[44:25] the random tells us
[44:28] seven spirits
[44:33] speak to us of seven men
[44:37] you see them in Revelation
[44:41] 4 and 5.
[44:46] they're the seven angels to the seven
[44:48] churches
[45:15] this is very evident that the word they
[45:17] refers to men
[45:19] aura
[45:24] Associated spiritus those seven spirits
[45:28] and Seven Stars I want you to notice
[45:31] this is
[45:39] two attributes
[45:44] but also tells us in the stories
[45:48] that the Bible also also mentions them
[45:51] as seven eyes
[45:58] it only mentions two things of them
[46:01] spirits
[46:03] and the Seven Stars
[46:06] but they're also seven eyes
[46:09] and also seven lips
[46:15] it is very evident the word they refers
[46:18] to Men
[46:21] of course there will be anointed
[46:47] it is evident that the seven spirits of
[46:49] God refer to the continuous Ministry of
[46:51] the same Holy Spirit in the lives of
[46:52] seven men
[46:55] in other words it's only one Holy Ghost
[46:58] but in seven minutes
[47:01] there's seven manifestations
[47:04] they're not seven different spirits
[47:08] but seven different anointed
[47:11] or commissions
[47:19] you can read it again it is evident that
[47:22] the seven spirits of God refer to the
[47:24] continuous Ministry of the similar
[47:25] spirit in the lives of seven men they
[47:27] say
[48:25] the store was meant to reflect light at
[48:29] night for the Sun
[48:43] they all did this through the holy
[48:45] ghosts
[48:52] so we see that the seven spirits
[48:54] actually refer to the one spirit of God
[49:00] working out the will and word of God in
[49:02] different Generations
[49:09] I would like to take the moment
[49:14] to see why God mentions them in this age
[49:19] why he brings This to Memory in this
[49:21] song what does this have to do
[49:24] what's the status
[49:29] yes because we're starting the virtual
[49:31] patients
[49:35] that God has an anointing for each other
[49:37] in other words
[49:41] God gives each age what they need for
[49:44] that age
[49:46] he said Paul for the age of Ephesus
[49:50] for the spirit church
[50:05] God knows
[50:14] God knows we'll go through different
[50:16] stages in our lives
[50:29] in the spiritual churches they didn't
[50:31] need a poem
[50:32] in Iranians
[50:42] with each and every one of us
[50:46] he says
[51:12] God knows what I need
[51:15] Raptors
[52:15] today
[53:08] back to the original word of God
[53:12] yeah
[53:16] in the time of Luther
[53:19] is
[53:23] and you were one of them
[53:26] that said
[53:40] something preached at something higher
[53:42] something something stronger
[53:44] usted
[53:45] you would have put a Luther aside you
[53:49] would have said
[53:51] what a simple message
[53:54] he's the messenger of all this churches
[54:00] so just sell him by faith
[54:03] isn't that what we do many times
[54:08] in a very simple message
[54:11] that wasn't for me yes
[54:16] something else
[55:16] the God is not in Rush
[55:27] before I can give you more
[55:32] the seven Messengers
[55:36] they did not give the same thing
[55:39] it doesn't mean it was the same Holy
[55:41] Ghost
[55:42] Santos
[55:44] from Paul to Brothers
[56:06] that's too high
[56:08] others say that's too low
[56:12] this is exactly what you need I mean
[56:16] if you think it's high or low oh
[56:22] this is
[56:38] each one of them
[56:41] [Music]
[56:45] Dios
[56:46] Liberty service God anoints
[56:50] the Son of God or the the man of God
[56:55] that is placed under the guidance of God
[57:00] to give the church as they need
[57:04] that's what God is telling to start his
[57:06] church age
[57:10] I am the eyes
[57:12] and I see what you need is
[57:17] correct what's the correct nutrients
[57:20] in order to give you to in order to get
[57:23] you to the stage you're going through
[57:24] right now
[57:27] we are many times brothers
[57:29] that we want something else
[57:33] we think we need something else
[57:37] I know what you need
[57:41] to jump to another state yeah
[58:21] when I'm not even at the first step yet
[58:23] [Music]
[58:27] la casa
[58:29] is
[58:30] I think the greatest ignorance there is
[58:33] ignoring where you are at foreign
[58:36] because if you ignore where you're at
[58:39] if you don't open your eyes to the place
[58:43] where you are
[58:45] you you want you won't know what you
[58:48] what you know you think you know
[58:52] but you're living in another place
[58:58] [Music]
[59:52] it's not enough for them
[59:55] foreign

[1:01:24] to the messenger of this age
[1:01:27] yours
[1:01:32] God is saying
[1:01:51] it gives you Direction

[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:52] who cares if it's a Luther
[1:03:55] an
[1:03:57] that's what I need
[1:03:59] if God sent me
[1:04:03] a message
[1:04:07] maybe that's what I need
[1:04:17] that's what many of us need
[1:04:20] foreign
[1:05:23] out there
[1:05:32] you say but God says
[1:05:40] today today
[1:05:50] John 16 12 says
[1:05:54] John 16 12.
[1:06:00] I have yet many things to say unto you
[1:06:02] said the Lord Jesus
[1:06:04] but you cannot bear them now
[1:06:16] you just had more to give them
[1:06:19] but it wasn't uh
[1:06:23] because it wasn't that right
[1:06:27] they couldn't they couldn't take them in
[1:06:30] Mysteries
[1:06:37] we haven't even arrived to justification
[1:06:39] many times
[1:06:58] matured yet
[1:07:10] then I can give you a little bit more
[1:07:22] the prophet continues saying
[1:07:26] the last paragraph
[1:07:28] this is
[1:07:36] as this same Lord identified himself
[1:07:38] with man in the Incarnation
[1:07:41] is
[1:07:43] again identifying himself with the man
[1:07:45] by his Spirit within him man
[1:07:47] speaking of these seven spirits
[1:07:51] he says these are my these El Senor
[1:08:11] human minds they may not even seem to
[1:08:13] qualify
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:17] nevertheless they are The Messengers for
[1:08:19] their age
[1:08:23] use the Moses
[1:08:33] he murdered that's
[1:09:39] what they needed
[1:09:43] okay
[1:09:50] didn't baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:09:52] Jesus Christ
[1:09:56] that at the moment
[1:10:02] that's not what the people needed
[1:10:07] it's not what they needed
[1:10:14] so as we get upset here at church
[1:10:19] it's preaching too simple um
[1:10:27] some get upset because of that
[1:10:31] is
[1:10:35] he's angry
[1:10:41] that's what you need
[1:10:44] don't complain
[1:10:49] this is
[1:10:53] perfect I never told you I was perfect
[1:10:57] I didn't put myself God placed me here I
[1:11:02] didn't butcher here
[1:11:06] I didn't put you here
[1:11:10] I'm not begging you to stay here
[1:11:24] I gave somebody more perfect
[1:11:57] with God
[1:11:59] all right
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:05] glory to God
[1:12:10] that's what patience is about
[1:12:14] the God has me here for a purpose
[1:12:24] to pay attention
[1:12:27] so what God wants to tell me today
[1:12:41] what God wants to tell me today
[1:12:44] me today
[1:12:47] the service will be what you make of it
[1:12:50] yes Brothers
[1:13:20] sometimes God won't move the mountain
[1:13:25] s
[1:13:26] God won't move the mountains
[1:13:30] God's telling you to climb the mountains
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:54] what I'm telling you
[1:14:07] sometimes the only way
[1:14:11] it's mine of yours
[1:14:20] sometimes the only way
[1:14:34] to uh shorten our trials
[1:14:38] is they lessen our trials
[1:14:42] shortened is
[1:14:45] to lengthen our patients
[1:14:50] sometimes the only way
[1:14:53] shorten our trials is
[1:14:56] to lengthen our patients
[1:15:05] sometimes the way to lengthen our trials
[1:15:09] is
[1:15:10] to shorten our patients
[1:15:14] the shorter our patients
[1:15:16] the longer our trials
[1:15:21] because God says you're not paying
[1:15:23] attention is
[1:15:29] you're ready to go to another state
[1:15:33] I could take the trailer away
[1:15:38] because you're not paying attention
[1:15:44] the musicians can't come forward
[1:15:57] numbers 21 4 says is
[1:16:07] and the journey from Mount hor by the
[1:16:09] way of the Red Sea to Encompass the land
[1:16:12] of Adam and the soul of people was much
[1:16:14] discouraged because of the way
[1:16:17] and these people speak against God in
[1:16:20] Moses
[1:16:23] wherefore have you brought us up out of
[1:16:26] Egypt to die in the wilderness
[1:16:28] but there is
[1:16:33] light bread
[1:16:37] God wanted them to eat light bread and
[1:16:41] they didn't want it
[1:16:47] that bread had everything they needed
[1:16:50] although it was light
[1:16:53] it's not a preaching is
[1:16:59] not the voice is
[1:17:04] what's behind that voice
[1:17:34] shall live by faith
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:53] shall live by faith
[1:18:01] anybody that received that message
[1:18:04] would be in the rapture
[1:18:08] without even speaking about the Rapture
[1:18:11] could somebody understand that is
[1:18:30] to be in the resurrection
[1:18:32] and go in the rapture
[1:18:41] how tremendous is our God
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:47] if you would please stand
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:51] they say he says
[1:18:54] when they became impatient is
[1:19:02] the Lord sent them fiery serpents
[1:19:06] serpientes
[1:19:08] fiery serpentes

[1:19:52] and God said you know what
[1:19:55] to say so you can have something to
[1:19:58] complain about

[1:21:14] sometimes that's the hardest thing it's
[1:21:16] classic kit it's to stay still
[1:21:19] when it appears like God's not doing
[1:21:22] anything
[1:21:23] it seems like it's the most difficult
[1:21:25] thing is to wait on him
[1:21:30] foreign
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:43] of our faith
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:50] I don't know what stage
[1:21:54] but one thing I do know is
[1:21:59] that God is trying to speak to you and
[1:22:01] tell you something
[1:22:03] don't think that he stops speaking
[1:22:06] so then he stops doing
[1:22:15] but he's trying to do something right
[1:22:17] where you're at
[1:22:18] maybe it's not what you want but it's
[1:22:22] what you need
