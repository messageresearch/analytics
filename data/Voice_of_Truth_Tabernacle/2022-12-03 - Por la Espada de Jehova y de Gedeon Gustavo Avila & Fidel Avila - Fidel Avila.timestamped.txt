[26:49] [Music]
[26:54] yes sir
[26:56] oh my God
[27:01] [Music]
[27:06] glory to the Lamb of God
[27:09] how many recognize that
[27:12] there's no one else like you
[27:17] to God like my God
[27:20] it has many other
[27:23] s that claim to have a mighty God
[27:27] but I have a God
[27:29] that it pleased him to manifest
[27:32] themselves
[27:38] but also in the church
[27:42] my God is manifesting himself in this
[27:44] day still
[27:47] is
[27:49] and I believe that's what makes my God
[27:52] so great yes
[27:54] that he pleases him to use something so
[27:57] small
[27:59] so insignificant stand is
[28:23] amen amen can you stay do you believe
[28:26] you're one of them
[28:29] one of those called by God Amen foreign
[28:56] the sword of the Lord and of Gideon
[29:04] that's very key to our message tonight
[29:07] is
[29:16] we were
[29:18] picked to share this word with you
[29:21] tonight
[29:24] if you can go to judges
[29:32] I'll give you a little more explanation
[29:37] of this beautiful title amen
[30:04] and the three companies blew the
[30:07] trumpets and break the pictures and held
[30:09] the lamps in their left hands and the
[30:11] troubles to the right hands to blow with
[30:13] all and they cried the sword of the Lord
[30:16] and
[30:18] of Gideon
[30:20] escuadrones
[30:42] amen one more time the sword of the Lord
[31:03] knowing that I have nothing to offer
[31:07] so that may not glorify myself
[31:19] as a service without you God is in vain
[31:24] this moment right now that we're having
[31:26] with you God is
[31:33] but I believe that my brothers and
[31:36] sisters
[31:38] bring a portion of you in them
[31:42] and according to your word
[31:46] where two or three are gathered in your
[31:48] name is
[31:54] so applying Faith to that word is
[31:59] believe in that it is being manifested
[32:01] right now
[32:04] we thank you that you're here with us
[32:07] you take control of me and my brother
[32:12] and of The Interpreter Lord
[32:14] you place ourselves in your holy hands
[32:18] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[32:22] amen amen you may be seated
[32:26] now the sword of the Lord and of Gideon
[32:31] now now when I was reading this word
[32:36] it made me
[32:38] it amazes me how important it was to God
[32:43] to say and sell the poder
[32:47] tell the people to say make sure
[32:51] this is what you shout
[32:54] because they could have said the the
[32:56] sword of the Lord only
[33:00] but he made sure that it said they also
[33:03] said
[33:07] it comes to tell me how much God is
[33:12] loves to share with his children
[33:18] he wants them to taste in Victory
[33:21] he wants them to know how it feels to
[33:24] know victory
[33:30] Gideon needed a little bit of that
[33:32] victory in his life
[33:36] so in his life can be changed around
[33:40] many of the times God wants us
[33:43] you have just a little taste of that
[33:46] Victory
[33:50] whatever it is you're going through
[33:53] must have a taste of that Victory
[33:58] I never ever want to look back to your
[34:01] past life
[34:03] cause you're in glory now
[34:07] you're in a place
[34:12] the devil can't touch
[34:15] your addictions your doubts whatever it
[34:17] is
[34:19] but God wants you to be part of that
[34:23] he's always worked in that pattern
[35:25] to
[36:06] that's what makes this Bible
[36:09] that's what makes this Bible
[36:12] his word to me so awesome
[36:16] but again now bringing this
[36:19] to our Lives
[36:22] Many Times Yes we are called
[36:27] but many times
[36:32] we come with many things
[36:37] we know that God accepts us the way we
[36:39] are yes
[36:42] but he doesn't want to keep us the same
[36:44] way
[36:46] our Prophet tells us that the holy
[36:48] spirit is always moving forward
[36:52] and we also have to move forward
[36:56] the only way we can move forward
[37:01] letting go of the Lord
[37:06] and whatever that is to you
[37:09] you have to identify yourself in the
[37:11] world
[37:13] the preachers bring it to you
[37:16] for you yourself have to make it
[37:19] personally
[37:20] and take it with you in your heart
[37:24] and Supply it to your life
[37:27] because that's the only way that the
[37:29] word can be make a fact foreign
[37:46] can just have a little taste
[37:49] of that Victory there is a Victoria the
[37:54] help Gideon
[37:56] push them on
[37:59] um
[38:08] the Great and Mighty conqueror
[38:11] to every man before you can do a job
[38:17] you have to have some motives
[38:22] some alternative
[38:25] something that you are working on
[38:28] for a working purpose
[38:31] something to work by
[38:35] our beloved Pastor over there in Phoenix
[38:39] he preached over there about how can I
[38:42] overcome
[38:45] and and he did these three questions
[38:49] who will overcome
[38:52] how will we overcome
[38:55] why do we need to overcome
[38:59] now I believe I'm one of those two needs
[39:02] to overcome amen
[39:09] [Music]
[39:40] not having a good why
[39:54] why do you want to stay in the same life
[39:56] that you're in foreign
[40:14] but you need a good route
[40:17] and I believe Gideon had a good wife
[40:22] because I and Gideon
[40:25] can relate to one another
[40:28] say in our past life
[40:35] how miserable we were
[40:37] living
[40:39] because remember now and my brother said
[40:42] it last week
[40:45] what type of Life Gideon was was living
[40:49] he was always expecting failure to come
[40:52] into his life
[41:00] would always come and take his food
[41:04] and he was always ready for them
[41:09] being a coward and the same thing with
[41:12] us
[41:13] the Devil comes and knocks us around
[41:21] and then he splits us out to the corner
[41:25] and we continue on our lazy daily lives
[41:28] in church
[41:34] but we were called for something else
[41:42] do you believe that you recall for
[41:44] something greater
[41:46] we don't promise something greater we
[41:48] must promise we will reveal the greater
[41:51] lives
[41:56] but it's needed
[41:58] of that faith that step of Faith they
[42:01] say they say they say or not even a
[42:03] great step of Faith
[42:06] but simply a desire pero
[42:11] a little hope doesn't
[42:40] overthink it
[42:43] doesn't think too much about it
[42:47] he just simply has a good why
[42:53] and ask you do you want a good white
[42:55] tonight
[43:00] do you want to have a reason why
[43:04] you want to step out of the life you're
[43:06] living in
[43:09] that's the questions I have to ask
[43:11] myself
[43:13] that's what God is always asking me
[43:16] foreign
[43:19] but again we need to let go of ourselves
[43:24] the prophet says and the message the
[43:28] Great Mighty conqueror
[43:31] everything in his kingdom must be for
[43:34] him
[43:35] Todo
[43:37] Para surreino
[43:40] it must be your heart
[43:46] for Him
[43:48] there can be nothing against him
[43:53] anything that was against him
[43:57] he would have to dismiss it
[44:00] he must have absolutely everything for
[44:04] him
[44:08] and we go back to the story of Gideon
[44:11] going down to 32 000
[44:14] to 3 000. Hombres
[44:18] refining them down uh
[44:23] refining them down to have a certain
[44:26] quality of people
[44:29] around Gideon
[44:32] to help them on
[44:34] to obtain the victory
[44:37] because when God calls a man
[44:41] he now when he calls them
[44:44] he commissions them also
[44:47] and when he commissions them then he
[44:49] stands unfortunate
[44:52] and then he does the same thing with us
[44:56] he doesn't only call us out of the world
[44:58] to save us and then let us be lost again
[45:06] he gives you the weapons the tools
[45:08] whatever you want
[45:11] it's up to you
[45:22] [Applause]
[45:32] something inside of them stirring in
[45:34] their hearts
[45:37] over something else
[45:39] God knew who he was calling
[45:42] he predestinated for before the
[45:44] foundation of the world
[45:51] that God is still wanting to use someone
[45:54] like me today
[45:56] he wants to bring out a Gideon
[46:00] he wants to bring out a Samsung
[46:03] he wants to bring out a roof
[46:06] he wanted to bring out all these great
[46:08] characteristics out of us
[46:12] but at the end of the day
[46:15] preach after preacher can come
[46:18] break their back lose their voice
[46:23] hey
[46:25] Brothers gracias
[46:27] all of that won't matter
[46:31] if there's a cold heart
[46:35] a heart heart
[46:37] a close mind
[46:39] unamente thinking the same thing time
[46:42] and time again
[46:44] I have another chance
[46:48] you may say I have another chance
[46:56] end of the year is coming by yeah
[47:00] I'll write a piece of paper
[47:03] and put in an envelope
[47:08] do the same thing time and time again
[47:13] it's needed but it's necessarily of a
[47:16] change
[47:17] and it's only up to you yes
[47:21] it's a personal walk yes
[47:24] personal I'm not bringing nothing new
[47:27] I'm just simply bringing what has been
[47:31] preached to us
[47:34] and I pray that tonight
[47:38] you you have a good wife
[47:42] after tonight
[47:50] foreign
[47:56] God bless everyone
[47:59] have a good why of being here a good
[48:02] reason for being here
[48:04] how many are happy for the Lord
[48:08] how many are in love with the Lord
[48:13] right now we should be more happy Sunday
[48:18] a wedding is going to take place
[48:37] this evening
[48:44] on Fridays
[48:46] we're talking about the Bible characters
[48:49] we're talking about the judges
[48:52] the focus now is Gideon
[49:00] replaced by the sword of God by the
[49:03] sword of the Lord and Gideon because it
[49:06] um
[49:09] I thought a little bit about the people
[49:11] of Israel
[49:13] and sometimes I think about a circle
[49:17] the people of Israel lived in a very
[49:20] much of uh what is a circle
[49:25] when the people left Egypt and they went
[49:28] to the Wilderness
[49:29] they lived in a circle
[49:33] of Israel on the time
[49:36] it was almost the same thing they were
[49:39] still living in a circle
[49:49] if you can put it up there yeah
[49:53] it's a drawing but it is
[50:09] I have it in a group of circles
[50:12] first you have it up front
[50:17] a front is the comfort zone
[50:21] when everything's okay with the person
[50:23] I mean I really don't need a guy right
[50:25] Brothers
[50:27] they say okay everything's okay
[50:30] I didn't get coveted
[50:33] nothing hurts
[50:37] I'm strong
[50:39] I don't need of God
[50:42] and in the following Circle
[51:43] that's where the midianites came
[52:40] all of the brothers
[53:15] intramos
[54:11] they found themselves as well
[55:10] found themselves Supreme
[55:48] in the days of the judges every man had
[55:50] his own absolute
[55:59] each man
[56:01] was acting correctly in his view now
[56:08] do you know the reason that they did
[56:11] that in judges
[56:14] this might surprise
[56:18] but the reason they did so in judge
[56:26] was because in those days they didn't
[56:28] have a prophet to whom the world alone
[57:16] the absolute
[57:19] DSM look
[57:22] um
[57:25] something something that I like brothers
[57:27] uh and judges
[57:42] and the three squadrons blew the
[57:44] trumpets
[57:49] and breaking the jugs they took the
[57:51] Torches in their left hand okay
[57:56] the people of Israel began to conquerque
[58:04] uh when Gideon was going to conquer
[58:07] the scripture says here
[58:11] that they began to play the trumpets
[58:17] and something that I like very much is
[58:19] that he says by the by the sword of the
[58:21] Lord and of Gideon this is
[58:27] and they start each one as post around
[58:30] the camp
[58:32] dios God dios God
[58:37] wants us to overcome
[58:39] God doesn't want us to not overcome
[58:42] God wants us to be Overcomers
[58:46] the problem doesn't lie in God
[58:49] the problem lies within us
[58:54] or when we don't do what he tells us
[58:58] that's why we can't overcome this is
[59:10] he gave us three points how we can
[59:14] overcome
[59:16] and who's going to overcome
[59:18] in Revelations 12 it says like this
[59:25] and they have overcome through the blood
[59:27] of the Lamb
[59:35] OS Nosotros we are there
[59:43] [Music]
[59:46] but sometimes Brothers
[59:49] we're not going to overcome
[59:52] by our own strength
[59:55] that's what we have to make clear to
[59:57] ourselves
[59:59] sometimes we want to help ourselves
[1:00:02] sometimes we want to do things and it's
[1:00:06] okay
[1:00:07] but it's God it's the blood of the land
[1:00:13] helps us to overcome
[1:00:16] how can we overcome
[1:00:19] in these last days look brother
[1:00:24] the way in which we can overcome is
[1:00:28] through this message
[1:00:34] gives us the keys
[1:00:38] we're able to overcome in these last
[1:00:40] days
[1:00:42] I believe
[1:00:48] to get out of this place
[1:00:53] it's giving us the keys amen
[1:00:57] why is it necessary that we overcome
[1:01:01] amen
[1:01:02] why Brothers
[1:01:06] why do we have to overcome
[1:01:11] you know why
[1:01:15] I'm going to tell you what our pastor
[1:01:17] says here
[1:01:21] I believe that we're living in a time
[1:01:23] when we know how to overcome that's what
[1:01:25] our Pastor said
[1:01:27] I believe
[1:01:29] what the prophet of God says
[1:01:32] he says
[1:01:35] a man completely surrendered to God om
[1:01:39] omnipotente becomes a powerful a
[1:01:41] powerful omnipotentes
[1:01:44] so there's the answer
[1:01:46] who
[1:01:58] did that he was a character
[1:01:59] that he couldn't overcome
[1:02:03] by your own strength and there was
[1:02:06] Gideon
[1:02:09] is waiting on God
[1:02:11] and look brothers and
[1:03:05] look Brothers
[1:03:36] was hearing
[1:04:31] that's behind all things
[1:04:34] amen amen amen
[1:04:42] they say
[1:04:45] um
[1:04:53] so then there's the answer on how to
[1:04:55] overcome
[1:04:58] there's a the answer bro
[1:05:01] we have to come to the moment
[1:05:04] where we surrender ourselves
[1:05:16] because we don't want to surrender
[1:05:18] ourselves much
[1:05:20] less to a man
[1:05:22] completely
[1:05:24] to the Holy Spirit
[1:05:30] he says it won't be you overcoming but
[1:05:34] God overcoming through you
[1:05:36] know we know we have to surrender
[1:05:38] ourselves
[1:05:40] but why don't we do it
[1:05:43] we know that we need the Holy Spirit
[1:05:47] but why don't we seek it
[1:05:50] you know this evening
[1:06:39] I see God everywhere
[1:06:42] anything
[1:06:49] we're gonna see everything with love
[1:06:54] to be able to overcome
[1:06:58] with the Holy Spirit
[1:07:00] the problem is
[1:07:07] don't go and seek him
[1:07:15] I'm not going to be an overcomer that
[1:07:17] way
[1:07:23] we come to church
[1:07:29] and we need to come in action my name is
[1:07:39] more burden than anything
[1:07:43] sometimes we come thinking about other
[1:07:45] things
[1:07:49] the majority of things that you're
[1:07:51] thinking about in this moment they're
[1:07:53] not worth it
[1:08:02] because the most important is
[1:08:05] your salvation
[1:08:10] our pastor says like this
[1:08:16] I feel like we're living in a time where
[1:08:18] we say
[1:08:19] or let someone else is someone else
[1:08:23] let someone else surrender
[1:08:26] I'm going to continue with what is mine
[1:08:35] do it
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:42] our pastor says uh he says the problem
[1:08:44] with that is
[1:08:46] that if you don't overcome
[1:08:50] you will be defeated
[1:08:53] if you do not overcome your fear look
[1:08:57] Brothers
[1:08:59] if we don't overcome right now right now
[1:09:05] whatever
[1:09:10] you didn't even have to overcome his own
[1:09:13] fears
[1:09:50] he's always taking care of everything
[1:09:53] Lord hallelujah
[1:09:58] if we don't overcome it Brothers
[1:10:01] if we don't overcome today
[1:10:11] all of that
[1:10:15] it's going to catch up to you and it's
[1:10:17] going to defeat yeah you'll have to
[1:10:19] overcome it today today
[1:10:24] look Brothers
[1:10:32] please stand
[1:10:40] look I'm a Barber Brothers
[1:10:44] and I am in contact with many people
[1:10:48] unhappy people
[1:10:54] that don't know him
[1:10:58] people that don't know where they're
[1:11:00] going
[1:11:02] peace
[1:11:04] they think that just for a moment of
[1:11:06] pleasure
[1:11:10] that they're going to be okay
[1:11:13] but today Brothers
[1:11:17] I wanna make sure
[1:11:20] that I'm gonna be with him
[1:11:24] imagine
[1:11:26] I'm I'm in church for more than 20 years
[1:11:34] and for me not to make it
[1:11:42] that all my life I'd be deceived in
[1:11:44] church
[1:11:45] that's how Gideon was
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:52] in church Gideon was in church but he
[1:11:55] was scared
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:58] and that's how many of us are
[1:12:01] but I believe today
[1:12:04] you don't have to do much brothers
[1:12:07] all you have to do is open up your heart
[1:12:09] to him
[1:12:12] I did it that way brother Reuben
[1:12:16] Contra Perdido when I found myself lost
[1:12:19] I said Lord
[1:12:22] come into my heart
[1:12:27] and there's sometimes I don't feel it
[1:12:30] [Music]
[1:12:32] but it's not about feeling it feeling
[1:12:34] him
[1:12:36] it's not about you feeling everything
[1:12:39] but it's about believing it
[1:12:42] about believing it
[1:12:46] doesn't it doesn't matter how you are
[1:12:48] this evening
[1:12:53] God can touch you
[1:12:57] and you'll never repent or regret that
