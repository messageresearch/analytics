[22:27] it's a pleasure to see everyone
[22:33] we give thanks to god what is the
[22:35] precious opportunity for this precious
[22:37] opportunity
[22:52] to our
[23:05] we miss you already
[23:18] and anywhere else they are watching
[23:35] 4.
[23:38] last week
[23:41] and verse 5.
[23:46] verse 4 eating and 5.
[23:57] the word of the lord reads
[24:18] yet now be strong o zerubbabel saith the
[24:20] lord and be strong o joshua son of jose
[24:23] deck the high priest and be strong all
[24:25] people of the land saith the lord and
[24:27] work for i am with you saith the lord of
[24:29] hosts
[24:40] according to the word that i covenaded
[24:43] with you when ye came out of egypt so my
[24:45] spirit remaineth among you fear ye not
[24:49] let us pray brethren
[24:53] sovereign eternal heavenly father
[24:56] we give you thanks
[25:40] your precious presence
[25:54] bless your
[26:08] thank you for everything and the
[26:10] precious the name of our lord jesus
[26:12] christ
[26:12] amen
[26:14] you may be seated
[26:18] we're in the subject the last days
[26:21] is
[26:39] or i just want to review a little
[26:42] okay
[26:45] of what we've been speaking on the last
[26:47] days
[26:50] hagar
[27:04] approximately the year 520.
[27:10] he was the
[27:11] prophet after zechariah
[27:13] with zechariah
[27:15] the people of judah
[27:18] in babylonia were captive in babylon
[27:22] in the year
[27:23] 8
[27:24] 865.
[27:29] and jerusalem and the temple were
[27:31] destroyed
[27:32] yes
[27:35] and even the government of syria reid
[27:38] persia
[27:39] the king of persia
[27:42] cyrus the king of persia that allows
[27:44] them
[27:45] allows the jews
[28:01] to begin the reconstruction
[28:05] they live
[28:07] and begin to rebuild
[28:09] but they never finished
[28:14] so the message of this prophet haggai is
[28:18] to aid
[28:20] to encourage them
[28:23] so they can finish building the temple
[28:25] of god
[28:27] the rebuilding of the temple estaba
[28:30] was halfway
[28:34] how many times have we gone through but
[28:37] a edifying
[28:39] quest
[28:40] that is only halfway converted with uh
[28:44] how that it's built halfway
[28:47] and that's abandoned there
[28:50] it looks
[28:51] uh desolate lonely
[28:54] inaudible it looks and how inhabitable
[28:56] to inhabitable
[28:58] that's how the temple was
[29:01] halfway done
[29:05] but the most tremendous was
[29:09] that the people vivian casa
[29:37] has been more important
[30:05] and i didn't come on fridays it didn't
[30:08] matter to me
[30:12] sometimes we give more importance to
[30:13] other things oh yes miraculous it's
[30:15] wednesday today no pasanada nothing
[30:17] happens
[30:19] it's midweek estoy
[30:33] but we're wrong
[30:47] you know
[31:14] i only work monday through friday
[31:16] muy buena
[32:14] every other sunday
[32:15] and you know
[32:18] and money mattered to me more questions
[32:21] that i didn't even take my pastor into
[32:24] account
[32:27] i came every other sunday one sunday yes
[32:29] and one sunday i'd miss
[32:32] i give things to a brother that told me
[32:37] why didn't you come on sunday
[32:39] and i explained to him
[32:42] and he told me in a good spirit
[32:45] you know brother yo
[32:46] i believe
[32:50] that if there is a job
[32:53] that takes time away
[32:58] god did not give you that job
[33:01] yes
[33:02] and that's true
[33:06] which has business many times
[33:36] i believe
[33:45] and left the lord's temple halfway
[34:17] and that's what the devil does
[34:22] said last week
[34:26] the most important tool
[34:28] of the enemy
[34:30] is discouragement
[34:32] you know why yo tomorrow this is how i
[34:34] take discouragement
[34:37] discouragement is like a drop of water
[34:40] sabi you know una gota de agua a drop of
[34:43] water
[34:45] when it falls in the same place
[34:50] up to a certain point continually
[34:56] that drop can go or pierce through that
[34:59] earth or stone
[35:12] in ancient times
[35:26] and they made a drop of water fall on
[35:27] their forehead
[35:33] a drop of water every
[35:36] every two seconds or every second yes i
[35:39] got that and that
[35:40] drop of water
[36:36] doesn't let you sleep
[36:56] other things can
[36:58] begin to come
[37:03] like energy loss
[37:05] like loss of interest
[37:09] losing your strength
[37:11] even discouragement
[37:14] can cause
[37:15] the depression depression
[37:18] yes
[37:20] and that's a very well used tool by the
[37:22] enemy
[37:27] that's one of the tools saiyan uses
[37:31] that's the tool he used with this
[37:33] animal he discouraged them
[37:36] what caused discouragement
[37:40] or what did discouragement caused it
[37:42] caused them to not focus on the
[37:43] temperament
[37:47] derailed their purpose
[38:02] that's what the enemy
[38:16] this temple
[38:27] well you know i wanna see even then okay
[38:33] although they were on or lost focus
[38:37] from the vision
[38:40] god did not forget them
[39:03] the lord's messenger in the lord's
[39:04] message unto the people saying i am with
[39:06] you saith the lord
[39:30] and the lord stirred up the spirit of
[39:31] zerubbab the son of the son of shaltil
[39:33] governor of judah and the spirit of
[39:35] joshua the son of jose deck the high
[39:37] priest and the spirit of the remnant of
[39:39] the people and they came and did work in
[39:41] the house of the lord of hosts their god
[39:43] yes
[39:51] there's our hearts that are sleeping
[40:19] i don't know if there's other trees
[40:22] or vines forgive me
[40:24] but if there's other vines
[40:26] they're false
[40:28] and they're temporary
[40:30] they're temporary
[41:18] there was
[41:27] against these barbarians
[41:30] these barbarians
[41:43] when this soldier and the army go to
[41:45] fight against them
[41:51] they have the greatest defeat of their
[41:53] life
[41:55] only a few survive
[41:58] among them this soldier this night
[42:04] he suffered a wound on his back
[42:09] and every time this soldier saw that
[42:10] wound
[42:14] those thoughts
[42:18] would bring back life
[42:24] even the edge of the blade
[42:27] cutting his
[42:28] back he could smell the blood
[42:32] he could see
[42:34] his
[42:35] his uh
[42:36] the people that were fighting with him
[42:42] being
[42:54] and their insides out
[43:10] and the time came
[43:13] where they had to go out again
[43:16] and fight the barbarians again
[43:22] he had two options
[43:23] la primera the first one
[43:29] he began
[43:32] his feelings began to speak
[43:36] and they'd say to him
[43:52] that's true
[45:02] hearts
[45:04] and he took his armor
[45:06] his shield
[45:10] and he was on the front lines of the
[45:12] battle
[45:14] and when he turns to his side elmira
[45:29] so he says
[46:11] many people just think that when they
[46:13] become a christian
[46:16] that's all they need to do
[46:20] that settles it forever
[46:23] and if they are christian
[46:39] for i become a christian to fight
[46:44] fight the good fight
[46:47] i became a christian
[46:50] in the battle line
[47:08] how to fight the fight
[47:16] and we can only do that as the holy
[47:18] spirit will reveal it
[47:23] we cannot take what some other nation
[47:25] tells us when we go to war
[47:28] some of their ideas
[47:32] but we got to take our own ideas
[47:36] the way the holy spirit would direct us
[47:40] and what ideas he would give us
[47:47] and chief of the army of the christians
[48:23] god bless you
[48:27] [Applause]
[48:30] god bless everyone
[48:32] if you just please stand for a few
[48:33] moments
[48:35] um
[48:36] if you'd open your bibles it's bueno
[48:38] resources
[48:40] to uh second corinthians chapter 10.
[48:44] verse 3 to 5.
[48:46] the
[48:59] foreign
[49:04] it reads like this this i see
[49:06] this for though we walk in the flesh we
[49:08] do not war after the flesh
[49:14] it's for the weapons of our warfare are
[49:15] not carnal but mighty through god to the
[49:18] pulling down of strongholds
[49:25] casting down imaginations
[49:27] and every high thing that exalted itself
[49:30] against the knowledge of god
[49:36] and bringing into captivity every
[49:38] thought to the obedience of christ
[49:46] you see when i i just kind of want to
[49:48] talk about uh the battlefront for a
[49:50] little bit
[49:54] yeah the the battlefront or last
[50:10] you know and this goes exactly with uh
[50:12] the temple being built
[50:17] and why the battle actually stopped
[50:21] you see because when there's a battle
[50:23] going on
[50:24] you know
[50:38] because we don't want uh to lose the
[50:40] wars
[50:42] but if we're not trained
[50:46] then then we lose the war
[50:49] hey man amen but when uh nations go to
[50:52] battle
[50:59] uh there's uh there's actually uh three
[51:01] grounds uh that they they fight that
[51:03] they they learn how to fight on i trust
[51:06] people that terrence
[51:45] you see when jesus
[51:47] is tempted from satan
[51:51] uh we can go to first john 2 16.
[51:55] and it tells us the three of fronts that
[51:57] that uh that uh the spiritual war is
[52:00] fought on you know
[52:06] and you know i think we need to really
[52:08] pay attention to this
[52:11] uh because uh you know we're we're
[52:12] fighting the spiritual wars
[52:16] this is uh this is kill or be killed
[52:20] amen
[52:21] that's what i believe
[52:24] i believe that that the state wants to
[52:26] kill you
[52:29] and if and if you don't if you don't if
[52:30] you don't take him down
[52:34] and then he's going to kill you hello
[52:37] so you need to take down all his weapons
[52:42] and figure out how he's trying to defeat
[52:44] you yeah
[52:58] and the pride
[53:17] he took he took him to each one of these
[53:19] things
[53:22] and and these are the grounds that that
[53:24] he fights with
[53:31] [Applause]
[53:40] you know we have to learn how to defeat
[53:42] discouragement
[53:46] defeating discouragement
[53:49] is something we have to learn
[53:52] discouragement
[53:54] it's a
[54:08] it's like it's like for example like a
[54:10] python
[54:12] amen a man you see a python does it it
[54:15] slowly starts wrapping around
[54:17] the prey
[54:22] and supressa and he's just slowly uh you
[54:24] know slowly you're making them where he
[54:26] can't move a whole lot especially
[54:31] but you know the first thing that it
[54:32] does
[54:35] is that that it um it makes you a look
[54:37] look at look at it
[54:40] that's what that's what it does to its
[54:42] prey
[54:44] it like hypnotizes the the prey
[54:49] you know i was watching i was watching a
[54:50] snake one time
[54:53] you know i was at my sister's house
[54:55] and uh you know this the snake was uh it
[54:57] was after a rabbit
[55:01] and i was just watching it from far away
[55:18] the rabbit just wasn't moving yeah
[55:21] and i was like man why isn't that rabbit
[55:23] moving
[55:26] because because it was hypnotized
[55:30] you see and that's what the devil does
[56:00] amen completely
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:15] it's in the message the greatest battle
[56:16] ever fights
[56:19] and it says this it is that it says now
[56:22] before any battle can be put in a ray
[56:25] they first have to choose a meeting
[56:26] ground or a place where the battle is
[56:44] and then it says this in the first world
[56:46] war
[56:50] it was so placed in no man's land and
[56:52] places where they fought and there's got
[56:54] to be a place selected
[57:11] where they gathered aviona
[57:14] and that's where goliath came out and
[57:16] called to the armies of israel
[57:21] that's where david met him
[58:34] he's
[59:02] because
[59:30] you have to be mentally
[1:00:12] [Applause]
[1:00:26] they had this plane
[1:00:27] unavion and it was called a psyops plane
[1:00:31] yeah don't have your own psyops and what
[1:00:33] this plane did
[1:00:35] it was a it was a psychological warfare
[1:00:39] era uh
[1:00:54] you know of the enemy there an amigo and
[1:00:57] uh it would it would be it would send
[1:00:58] messages
[1:01:01] oh you know to to the to the enemy al an
[1:01:04] amigo that was on the ground
[1:01:06] and
[1:01:07] they would say stuff like this
[1:01:12] [Applause]
[1:01:21] there's an ambush and you're going to be
[1:01:23] destroyed
[1:01:26] and and you know and it was and then
[1:01:28] they would just say you would advance
[1:01:31] and just say that the army would keep
[1:01:32] advancing
[1:01:36] oh but i'm sure that many of the
[1:01:38] soldiers were were thinking on those
[1:01:40] messages
[1:01:44] and then uh as they continued to advance
[1:01:48] the that same plane that's
[1:01:50] my view
[1:01:57] it would just start scattering all these
[1:02:00] uh all these letters
[1:02:04] or or you know just a different stuff
[1:02:06] that they can read oh diferentes
[1:02:09] and they would read these and read the
[1:02:11] letters
[1:02:13] and it would just be like well give up
[1:02:15] now
[1:02:18] and we won't
[1:02:30] they started believing
[1:02:31] what the plane was was saying
[1:02:36] they would just drop their weapons
[1:02:39] and they would just put up their hands
[1:02:41] yeah
[1:02:42] they hadn't even begun to fight
[1:02:45] and they were already
[1:03:28] there's a
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:51] but the devil said the devil was telling
[1:03:53] him in their minds
[1:03:56] if god loves you so much why why is it
[1:03:58] why is it so hard
[1:04:01] why is it so hard to build this chamber
[1:04:05] if if god loves you so much
[1:04:07] you see if he was a real god
[1:04:24] i don't
[1:05:04] yes
[1:05:48] you know i went um
[1:05:50] i read second corinthians chapter 10.
[1:05:54] yes
[1:05:56] um i just something that that caught my
[1:05:58] attention
[1:06:00] was that verse four foreign
[1:06:17] you know what a stronghold is
[1:06:19] fortaleza you see it's it's something
[1:06:22] that um
[1:06:24] that
[1:06:25] we could say
[1:06:27] a strong place
[1:06:41] you cannot win the battle ganar la
[1:06:44] battaglia if you're always all playing
[1:06:47] defense
[1:06:49] defensive uh a team cannot cannot win
[1:06:52] the game
[1:06:55] if he just plays defense the whole time
