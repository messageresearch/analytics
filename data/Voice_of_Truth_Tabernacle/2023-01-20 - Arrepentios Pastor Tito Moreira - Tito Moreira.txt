Acts chapter 2 verse good to be in the house of the Lord good to have come have communion with him I desire to receive it amen if you're not in the right attitude it's important to be in the right attitude with the right attitude you come with an incorrect attitude we will receive nothing on behalf of God the good news is that we can change it we can change our attitude is my way of thinking help me this evening to come in a very humble way and sincere with him acts 238 we know this by a memory I believe and if you don't know about it it's a good verse to memorize Acts 2 38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we want to title this message repentios say repent let us pray heavenly father that's the momentum at this moment you want to put ourselves in the communion we can receive what we need foreign repent Pedro Peter believe he was the right person to give that sermon that he gave on that day Pedro Peter savias he knew what it was to repent if you don't know what it was to to carry the sin Center and feel uh guilty is a sermon speaking on who Jesus was he started telling them the history before giving them the medicine he tells them the problem any chance we want to give the medicine or give the answer better you said then put in the questions speaking on them all these Jewish people to tell them who Jesus was and how guilty they were how great of a sin they have committed crucified in crucifying him he is and when they heard this UVO um there was a guilt that came upon their hearts so the Bible says that they were pricked in their hearts now this is very important normally we feel guilt cuando algono is important when something matters to us something doesn't matter to us normally we don't feel guilt before the repentance there comes a guilt I believe one of the reasons there's no revivals where the people Truly Come To The Altar and humble themselves because the people have not repented truly there are many here that we have not repented yes important it's important to come to to the community repented it's important that when we get baptized when we come to the communion as well now the problem we know is the problem is it's unbelief of course but a little bit further on when you study what sin is in the message he says in sin means to miss the marks to Mr Mark because there's something wrong all right now the problem normally with sin is it it brings uh consequences [Music] sin is not evil only because of what what is done but the consequence is that it brings sin brings the consequences of death the Bible says the wages of sin are dead it comes in different manners and one of the things one of the things the sin brings is it's guilt is knowing that you could have done better you're better than what you did it's better than what you thought you are better you are a better person you're a better person [Music] there's a guilt uh gradido they have a transgressed guilt and a shame and a dishonor that comes with it the greatest problem is not is not the sin the greatest problem is what you have it brings see look at today uh no guilt is one of the feelings one of the most experiences of the human experiences one of the most profound human experiences that exists studying a little bit on what the guilt is and affects every area of your life someone carries the guilt people hide hide our sin behind a religion is but yet it is foreign foreign doing what they should truly do that's right brother we try to make excuses of it but the truth is the sin is uh it brings torments I haven't done things because there are times that the biggest critic that there is is the one that's within us [Music] it was so draining he was tormenting her so much that she couldn't bear it any longer so she ran to the feet of Jesus Christ of giving everything she had to to resolve El problem the problem that was within her problem is the only problem she had you could see her she has a very beautiful home she had a beautiful home maybe a very beautiful woman you could say she maybe didn't have a complex everyone thought that maybe she was beautiful she had no sickness she was being tormented there's people that are conscious of their torment and there's people that are not because but sin always torments I believe one of the biggest problems foreign able to repent of them let me tell you many of us we have the we would have or should have I I should have done it I I could have done things different yes and that torment is within us many times we want to make an excuse of it we want to change the story Adam changed the story why are you hiding because the woman that you gave me Lord how we are many times the judging the others of not forgiving because that is a great sin we changed the story our mind changes the story so that we are not the guilty ones how much you heard in your heart is hindering you within foreign of The Sinner they only covered it but they didn't take it away continue feeling guilty say yes they were we make ourselves strong we but no one truly knows of that guilt that we truly carry within us of perhaps maybe stealing I worked your business the brother of maybe betraying someone I've spoken speaking against someone you could just try to justify it all you want to yeah well it's going to be there and it will hinder you yeah Holy Spirit can no longer help you until you deal with that sorry that is we got something we speak it's more weight for us some pencil Mass it's more weight the weight of the act that we committed peso del nino or the the child that died the way of breaking someone's heart that's what that's what sin causes a way within us we could have made another decision what about those sins that we can no longer restore you steal from somebody you can return the money to them there are things that you cannot repair they're just there the peso the weight of the things that cannot be changed tense muscles El nopoder to socialment not being able to be open socially hiding your actions stress stressartanto I'm thinking so much and your secrets especially one a problem the problem that because it cannot be repaired is especially when we're our own punishment there's nothing okay it's watching to the internet that has not felt there's nobody here we like to jump but we all have something like first the people to know Bueno you look all around till you find where you can get good enough then tell me where that place is I want to go too I said Christ can never came to say good man you think you're good Christ there's a line right here cigarettes you talk about cigarettes [Applause] in that person of Jesus Christ in order to save man yes I believe that and he died to say sinners like you and I then see yes I believe that now it's just like this we're on one big building here and we're in jail United scene and I can't start over in this corner this will help me get out of jails [Applause] he's a renegade to begin with someone else it was the one that wasn't born no matter what he is [Applause] will take care of themselves two things forgiveness accept your conditions before you can face The One That Forgives no try to excuse me this way you have to face your sin you have to face your sin does you know good this is the problem with the church in these days with all of us we come in accepting forgiveness well he forgives me but you never repented you never faced we never realized in your life we didn't get stayed back with what we we did it didn't stay back with what you did the Bible says the Sin Zim follows you it catches up to you it comes with a dishonor the feeling that you could have done better you try to hide it and then it becomes anger and you begin to accuse others because they haven't been delivered of their own sins to the soul of man amen and the tongue critical people's so critical we're very critical as human beings you know why you get so angry while we react the way we do because there's a weight within us you get upset with everything we get frustrated there's no peace within us why because there's a weight in our soul doesn't matter how much you've tried to ignore it nothing will take it away nothing nada nothing psychology or excuses or your justification we're trying to cover it or hide it nothing takes away that weight until you repent until you face your sin Until you realize you're guilty until you come to God and say I'm guilty guilty we are guilty tell us that are in our lives it's there in you and nothing will undo it until you understand that you're guilty that's why we can't make progress Brandon says that they criticize him for baptizing this man because as soon as he got out of the water of baptism he went to go smoke a few weeks ago I was downstairs because we have never faced our guilt but think to the holy ghost that he comes and revealed to us and he says you've done this wrong son thank me he's still knocking at the door it is not behave the way you do foreign crucified alunico the only one that woman she knew he was the only one the only one you can take that torment out of her heart that guilt that's why she didn't care about anything else resolution anyone that can help us many of us we're accepting forgiveness without accepting our guilt that's not how it works come here that's why there's no Revival Brothers accept their obligations of this of sin is simply just hide it that's not how it works but if my people were to Humble themselves if my people were to Humble themselves and cry out into me and prayed I would forgive their sins I would heal their lands just have a little bit of piano I ask myself what would this what did this woman feel in the Book of Luke here when she felt all that weight come off of what would she have felt when Jesus Christ said woman all of your sins they're all forgiven what did she feel there are people that don't understand why we answer the way we do the people that come to church they're happy because God gave them a good job they worshiped they sing to him he give them a house [Music] the Deliverance of my heart get on something way too much has left me Kentucky I don't have anything to hold on to yeah they can't keep me in jail any longer people worship God hallelujah [Music] I'm guilty oh okay oh how terrible it feels to know no solution for some of the things we've done but the only solution is here [Music] the only thing he's the only solution you would please stand foreign because they didn't know her story [Music] Elvis Presley you find yourself there you try to cover your sins your guilt your shame you've tried to put makeup on it you've tried to dress like a Christian you've tried to justify your works but none of that will work you've tried to place blame on somebody else [Music] I do that but that won't help you [Music] Until you realize that you're guilty but there's someone that's willing that was willing to take away all of your sin oh hallelujah hallelujah so many demons we carry many times simply because we don't face our situation but he is here's the solution to your problem you don't have to continue nervous you don't have to continue if you simply face your problem the solution is here they asked Peter what shall we do is we're guilty Peter what must we do Peter knew what it felt like to deny the Lord like he no longer was worth anything that's how sin makes us feel don't know open ourselves up to God but he says I have the solution it's the same one that I needed repent if you studies get that out of your heart he will give you the Holy Ghost be able to receive a new life to receive what you are seeking foreign how many are there here that are guilty but okay I believe we're sincere this evening we were able to see it we would say the reason I haven't done more for God because there's something within me I'm not good enough that I have seen so much that I can no longer do more for God what would we do is that sin was not easy well life would we live no longer tormented us it doesn't have to be a question you can resolve it this evening you can resolve it this evening [Music] oh God [Music] oh God we are so guilty Lord oh Lord forgive us I've done so many things Peter's greatest [Music] something that he had lived repent we've all lived it we all need to repent told us all of us doesn't matter how good you feel that's alive
