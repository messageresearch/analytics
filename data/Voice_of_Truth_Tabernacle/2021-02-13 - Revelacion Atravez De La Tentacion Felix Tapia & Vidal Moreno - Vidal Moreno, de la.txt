your scriptures your bibles of corinthians chapter 10 verse 13. i would like to thank god for the opportunity and our pastor for the trust that was given to me to come up here and and share this it's a blessing for me and i hope what i bring is a blessing for you especially there had no temptation taken but such as coming to man but god is faithful who is who will not suffer but but you will be tempted above and ye are able to temptation also should make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it and then we go to john chapter 15 verse 13. juan capitolo versus greater love that no man than this that man that laid down his life for his friends lord i ask you that you help me here tonight lord whatever it is that i bring lord okay whatever desire that you brought to me to speak lord of lords lord i know it was you lord yo lord but you are perfect lord lord and your word is perfect is perfect lord i ask you that you help everyone here and those that are watching throughout the internet miranda internet may you give them blessings as well lord okay i may not know them but you know them lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i had a couple weeks to meditate he gave us the schedule like three weeks four weeks out and and i was i was thinking of what should i speak about josh because the team that we're having right now is being prepared for temptation right and the title that me and brother vidal have chosen and and as i was thinking i was like what should i what should i talk about um we know we we already know that that drugs brings us temptations and so forth so i was asking god what should i talk about and and and as i was thinking i was i was thinking i was he gave me choose your friends wisely you know because sometimes you know we we meet people in life and they could be in our lives for the long run and you could build a good bond and a friendship with them and you could you could do good things with them yes you know there's a lot of great friendships here at church i have a lot of great friendships you know we all have a lot of great friendships amongst each other but then sometimes we meet friends i was reading an article the other day of why why people go through certain temptations especially the young adults and people in high school and in middle school and and and i i was reading through it yes and and one thing that caught my attention it said that the reason why certain people want to dress a certain way yes it's because porque they want to fit in with the group that they're hanging out with identification you know you know if you hang out with gang members uh you know eventually you'll become a gang member you know if if you hang out with people that just a party all the time you know you're always going to be partying all the time you know because you you always go in into what they're doing you know and the reason we go there you know we put ourselves in that atmosphere you know if we hang out with people that do drugs all the time we go into those we fall into those temptations you know we fall into those drug habits you know sometimes we say oh i'm not going to be i'm not going to do it you know and me you know growing up in the world i've been on the side where i'm the one that that that's around doing certain things and there's people around me that are not doing it where there's people that that are doing certain drugs that i've never done and you know i used to promise myself when i was a little boy there i would never do that but you know i was around it so much you know i i was always there around those people that i eventually fell into those things you know that's why we should be careful on who we hang out with we should be careful on who we open up because they said you know what you you want to hang out with us come on you know and and and then sometimes they see us nose van you know we dress differently and little by little they start telling you you know what maybe you should just dress like this you know maybe you should come and hang out at the party vegas fiesta or just come and hang out with us you know all we're celebrating here take this drink you know those are little things that eventually the enemy tries to come in and do essa and we've got to overcome those temptations you know what's one way we can over we can avoid those temptations you know and i shared this before but i i want to share it again you know i'm not going to read the quote you know just make sure who they're following it no lager you know there's sometimes people that won't understand you personas you know but there is somebody that understands us and his name is the lord jesus christ you know he knows you better than he knows when we know ourselves he knows your capacity he knows what you're about el salvador you know i i i was listening to something the other day and it just came to me you know i may tell people that that i don't do certain things you know he he understands you more than anybody you know in revelations chapter 3 verse 20. it says behold i stand at the door and knock. if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him into him and i was up with him and he will with me you know he is just waiting for you to open up your door for him you just have to get involved with this word you know just have a bond with them you know and we heard this many times how he was tempted in so different ways but he stayed with the words and that's what we got to do when we're tempted you know just stay with his word be with him estar cornell let him be our friend the heart just be with him all the time listen to his words i know it's not easy your second was fossil this world offers you so many things so much things that he says he could make me better you know as we get older our friendships go away you know when i was 15 16 17. you know throughout those years i was i had so many friends you know wherever i go everybody knew me you know it don't matter what store i went to what place i went to you know everybody knew me you know as i got older friends went away you know friends that told me that they would never be leave my side you know your friends will leave your side eventually you know they'll get bored of you they're going to want to find new friends especially when you need them especially and you're going through hard times but god will always be there for you it doesn't matter how many times you fall wanna read this quote and i'm going to close up it's from um how can i overcome del mensaje from brother brown mano branham 1963 april 25th look he showed us how it's done to you're back to the word again greater is he that's in that's in that he's in you then that's in the world is then i overcome these things of the world anton says sorry i annoyed i messed up on the reading but because it's the world in me and if ye abated me my world my word is in you porque la palabra i need you to help me through these temptations thank you brothers gracias god bless you if you open your uh bibles up to proverbs 4 23. as brother felix said uh and you know it's a little cold outside today yes and i was uh i i was i was i didn't think i was tired until i got off work but you know with the weather being so cold and everything else on frio and and you know when things are cold you know they're hard to work with you know you need to apply some heat and that's it a lot of times no i think that's why we're here you know this evening you know we need some some some of the the heat of god this is 423 says like this it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life when we talk about a temptation you know there there's something that that that uh that is revealed to us through temptation i don't believe god would allow temptation you know if it didn't reveal something to us you know there's things that that we are completely unaware of we're not aware of within ourselves than nosotros but you know when when uh temptation comes it begins to reveal things that are within your heart you see things that that you you wouldn't know if temptation uh um didn't come uh it reveals it reveals uh you know the the good or the bad in you you know that's what temptation does it's okay that's one of the things that it will do but temptation [Music] you know it entices you know to to your hopes and and your desires and you know that's that's what we want to know you see that's that's what that's what i want to know you know where where do i find pleasure you see where where does the youth of voice of truth tabernacle find their pleasure is not bad that's what my question is for for the youth and everybody here this evening where do you find you know i have another question you know your pleasure do you find it in god do you find it in the presence of god in serving god encounters or do you find it somewhere else you see because i see a lot of times you see where we'll be here in church and you look like you're having absolutely no pleasure see we can have a bible study and we'll complain about how long it is but we can sit there and watch netflix and not say a word all we and that's like you know if you want to if you want to go ahead and go into pleasure up before pain i didn't expect more pain because the first pleasure that that that um that evil um that that evil what she did okay you know it created more pain what what did it create it created a created cane vino that that that that's what came out of that first pleasure brought more pain to his mother is what the in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portions of the king's meat no contaminants nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself you see it was purpose in daniel's heart you know not necessarily in his mind you know and that's what we need to make sure that we do yes you know make sure it's settled in our hearts you know that we not defile ourselves did we not [Music] luke 22 28 lucas venti dos vintiocho and i just want to kind of go over some things it reads like this this scene you know it's talking about about peter here or about the disciples you know and and it and the disciples are talking with jesus you see and and and jesus says these words to peter jesus well to his disciples excuse me [Music] as my father hath appointed and the lord said simon simon senor behold satan had desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat he says but i have prayed for thee that dies of faith of fail not bro and when they are converted strengthen thy brethren you see you know the reading of the scriptures and you know i i like that you know because they were with him in his time of difficulty in the time of the test they were with jesus pray for thee that thy faith fail not no fault you see so you have you continue with jesus in the temptation [Music] will he leave you in yours lord it wasn't just anybody that was praying for him so when you go through temptations as as as jesus was telling peter jesus because peter jesus was telling peter jesus he was giving him a warning he was letting him know that the satan was going to come after him after peter but you know you know how it is you know when we see peter joseph later on lego you know he he he he just he's just in himself el esta and and sue said you know in his being he's just you know he's just very boastful and sus esta very arrogant you know he's like you know what don't worry about me i got this he had his strengths elton this is one thing you know when temptation comes it reveals to us as well you know it reveals to us our weaknesses and our strengths amen amen you know i got a quote here from uh brother branham thank you and you know he says this elise in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says when moses come out from his 40-day fast up on the mountain where he had the two tables of stone satan tempted him at his weak spots that was his temper and he threw down the commandments and broke them it says but when satan met the lord jesus the bible says that there was no man on the face of the earth of you see i'm going to be uh shifting gears now but you know we we we see as well we see another man by the name of abraham you know he was the father of the face and his greatest strength was faith that that was his greatest strength when he went down to egypt you know and they they started looking at his wife you know they just desired her own you know and he he right away he didn't trust his faith failed him and you know and he lied he meant dior you see this was his strengths you see so the devil you know he she's gonna come at you and tons of zelda no matter how strong you think you are you know where where you think your strengths are oh don't know who said that you see he's coming after you he's he's not gonna stop and this is exactly what he did with peter you see that peter was a brave man if somebody was brave it was peter pedro you see when [Music] until they pointed them out and they said this is one of his disciples you see it was his strengths but even in his own strength he was unable to not because david was not supposed to be there he was not supposed to be on the roof he was just you know up there just chilling he was just relaxing and you know that's what happened that's what's happened to many of us yes we just relax is in battle yeah i got this [Applause] because he was in the wrong place it reveals our insufficiencies just wait a little bit see what works amen amen and i think that uh you know uh daniel and the three young hebrews they were very uh capable men uh you know the the greatest thing about it was that they were very uh prepared man uh you know and i believe it's it was the reason that they were very prepared and very capable [Music] it was because god had prepared them you see uh these they had been taken captive and taken to a far away country things weren't weren't the same you know like they were back at home and casa but yeah and you know there's as many times in our lives where you know we ask uh we ask why did this happen to me okay you know why would god allow this esto oh you know and i as a young man i ask myself a lot of that question a lot of times why would god allow something like this you know i think it's a very common question among the youths you see why this why that but you know your question will come you know it will be answered in due time you know then you'll have a good attitude you see if that plan is gonna be revealed no matter what circumstances you are put in no important question what circumstances it could be a terrible circumstance but god is trying to show the devil sons and daughters of god they were not conformed no second formatting to do the the traditions of of the babylon alas you see they were these these young men estos they were the cream of the crop they were the best of the best and i believe that that's what's sitting in front of me this evening i'm not gonna because he has a job many times we get conformed to uh you know the things of of the world you know and and you know that's not what we're supposed to do and you know what daniel had proposed in his heart and the three young hebrews i believe they had the same attitude they would not be like the rest of them that they would overcome any temptation that came their way the temptation was all over the place and you know they were told to bow down they were just as respectful as they could be to the king they were sarcastic sarcastic you know they weren't smart alex about it they weren't smart alex you know they weren't like they didn't answer him in any kind of way you know these young men didn't estos you know it's just funny you know that a lot of times you know our kids we we don't like the way they answer us you know they may be sarcastic or smart alex my question is where did they get it oh you know where where did they get their sarcasm where are they where did they get their smart alignment from don todo but these young men you know you know in closing you know these these young men would not bow down you see that they they said they would not do it and you know the thing of it is is that you know they were like you can do what you want to do you know our god our god he is able to deliver us you know he through every age he's heating you know but it didn't matter to them it didn't matter that it was seven times harder you don't matter what age we're in no important just keep heating it up devil sigelantando [Music] they are thrown into the furnace [Music] he [Music] [Music] they were screaming [Music] that they were having a revival [Music] there was only three in there [Music] [Music] but we have something greater today [Music] [Applause] [Music] the [Music] said this with these words [Music] paul has been revealed to us [Music] where we shall be revealed to paulo yes [Music] this right here of divine [Music] oh [Music] [Music] difficult [Music] [Music] we're
