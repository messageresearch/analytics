[Music] army are glad to be in the house of the lord tonight amen i'm gonna stay right there on the back of them because are you guys hear us isaac amen just follow my lead bro you got this it's a blessing to be here amen i thank god for his promises and blessings in my life keep it up though no god god will never will never forsake one of his children amen that's right in times of uh trouble in times of need he is there with us hey man i'm not sure if i shared it before i'm happy and i'm honored to be a part of this church we are blessed to have a pastor uh whom we see god in amen i i remember uh like maybe four months after moving here there i would call my dad still yeah and and and tell him what i was going through my problems don't you have a pastor over there and i was like i'm like yeah but i mean so if my dad was tired of the burdens i gave him you know alien cannot and it says like this then chose him all the plane of jordan and lord journey east and they separated themselves the one from the other entonces abraham dwelled in the land of canaan and la doll in the cities of the plane and pitch his tent towards sodom rama campo hey man let's amen amen you may go ahead and take a seat [Music] uh plata they were rich in gold ricos and otto and they were rich in uh in cattle tambien and they both they both had so much possession in the same place and thresholds and among other things so abraham said let's go ahead and and separate and what's outstanding to me is that abraham is it afram let um lot take the decision of where to go if you go left situta and the bible says that a lot looked out into the outskirts into the city of maybe that would be great for my channel beneficiary so he goes off to saturday and sodom's is in the planes and abraham stays in canaan before he he he goes on yeah so every time god i believe abraham placed himself in the hands of god who established that's why he told lot to make the the decision but i saw that this is in god's hands [Music] you want to have one foot in the church in the world but god says you cannot have two masters it's either you serve me [Music] india i i lived in that area of hollywood hollywood i was maybe like 40 minutes away from there and uh it's very eye capturing it's very entertaining to be out there is you know it's uh and i'm gonna bring it i'm gonna bring it home i'm gonna make it a little bit personal for us the youth here there's uh at times we we we separate ourselves from one another the nosotros and i've said it before it's sometimes it's because we think we're better than our brother we think we're better than our sisters you know i'm a separate from this person because i don't like them from this person because they have a bad attitude from this person because we both like the same girl it's a personal you know that's not the separation that abraham and lot did we actually need one another because the we separate from the wrong things separate from god we love those who despise us one more time we love we love more of those who despise us than those who actually love us and i could i could just imagine lot yeah my father not alone when he was looking out into uh jordan to sodom what he probably saw more possessions in his hands but brother branham says that the word romano brandon says all that lead or five towns against fortes and in the war and in in that war is uh is held hostage not hostage sorry uh captive lost him and his family and all of his family you know and that is it's like that with us sometimes we go with our flesh desires we want to be out in the world and like i said abraham gave lot the decision to choose where lopez and that's the same as god giving us free will yes la mesmo dios dandonos [Music] god doesn't force me to serve him you know and what amazes me about the story we keep reading abraham found out that you know abraham didn't say i'm not going to go into war afraid he didn't say that the bible actually didn't say that he went to rescue his nephew the bible says that he went to go rescue his brother so abraham i could just imagine abraham amen [Applause] i will [Music] facing hard trials facing hard times instead of being you actually deserve everything you're going through but we shouldn't be like that i don't know the videos yo let's tell them get up brother where is [Music] you figure yourself out you know we want to be blessed by god you don't want to be a blessing to others we all know that we're a blessing to someone amen god placed us in someone's life because that person needed you persona you know 34 yeah [Music] for those says the lord god behold i even i even even i will both search my sheep and seek them out as a shepherd seek us out his flock in the day that he that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark days he did it once already perfection and la pre casona perfection i'm a reader fast if you can follow along bro abraham lot his cousin had backslid and you you see the real true spirit of christ i hope you get it no matter how far he had backslid when he was in trouble he came abraham here came abraham with him in army the aliens around about through the valleys of sodom had come down and had took sodom and it's keen abram problemas when he looked down and saw that the enemy had taken away his blood relation he formed an army of his own servants he formed a legend of angels and came to the earth to pursue the devil overtook hallelujah this person now we love him for that foreign [Music] let's not be a burden to our brothers in galatians it actually says and galatas and siddhis in order to fulfill the law of god it says to help our brothers i'm just going to finish with this the disciples i believe it's in the book of mark they were they were debating in heaven who was going to be and i could just imagine peter's like oh i'm gonna be the greatest you said maybe he said oh why did this is the greatest is the one to help the brothers the greatest is the one that was always there today let's be a helping hand bless [Applause] give me one second i've never interpreted them to preach i'm gonna be reading in genesis 14. and i just want to thank the lord in this night and i'm very happy that you all made the decision to be here yesterday [Music] and uh the separation and the war hablando de la separa and now i'm gonna i'm gonna speak in genesis 14 12. and they took law abram's son abram's brother's son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed tomorrow and he brought back other and skipping over 16. and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the woman also and the people i think we missed our our title for tonight but just with the title i i don't i don't feel like preaching brother solomon can we repeat that this night unto death for my brother you are my brother hermano i'm going to open with a testimony now testimonials uh me and my brother billy joey miramano billy i'm speaking this because it's parallel parallelo you know there was strife or contest and i couldn't find the way in contrary how to work that out you know i'm not the only one for our minds you know he made his choice eliso no my brother billy he's an amazing brother he made his choice but it was it was up to me to go to war to the death of my will of my pride it says the brother brandon mentions this was the king's slaughter element of there's not only faith as equality no solamente esta la fe como una qualidad and abraham seed poco and abrahams should imagine you're on your way to go to the king slaughter imagine with 300 and something servants of your house and casa but the amen amen these were not men from outside of abraham these were abraham's circumcised men born in his own household [Music] it's the quote above return from war perfect picture of christ and the church perfecto cuadro de cristo el iglesia the holy spirit leading el espirito santo giando and abraham being a christ like having a christ-like mind yes so abraham having a
