[18:44] and it came to passes when as they came
[18:47] when David was returned from the
[18:48] slaughter of the Philistines
[19:04] that a woman came out of all the cities
[19:07] of Israel singing and dancing to meet
[19:08] King Saul with tablets with joy and with
[19:11] instruments of music
[19:15] and the woman answered one another as
[19:18] they played and said
[19:24] and said Saul has slain is thousands and
[19:27] David is ten thousands is
[19:41] and Saul was very Roth and the saying
[19:44] displeased him
[20:10] because your words are alive
[20:48] thanks to God
[20:59] we speak of predestination
[21:03] because he was called he was playing
[21:13] this is great for us
[21:17] also call tonight
[21:28] because God has brought you tonight
[21:40] I was chosen to share online
[21:49] when you believe it Brothers
[21:57] it says that David was a man after God
[22:02] says
[22:16] what satisfaction
[22:19] we have brothers
[22:22] be safe
[22:27] foreign
[23:28] Israel

[23:44] foreign
[24:19] [Music]
[24:38] [Music]
[24:43] foreign
[25:43] Brothers
[26:06] God is good Brothers
[26:12] God wants to try his children so we can
[26:15] see our faithfulness
[26:22] to relax ourselves
[26:25] to take it easy
[26:28] every young man and young lady
[26:31] to have their experience with God
[26:34] if you have a feeling
[26:45] it's because there's a or if the reason
[26:48] is that the sister plays the piano
[26:50] version
[26:52] the brother preaches very well I want to
[26:56] be like that person no brothers
[27:01] Hermanos
[27:50] is
[28:35] [Music]
[29:04] God has counted every one of our steps
[29:18] God is good
[29:24] uh
[29:27] David had no education
[29:31] what the prophet says
[29:37] he took him out of the flock or from
[29:40] from
[29:42] God never departed from
[29:50] [Music]
[30:15] an evil spirit Came Upon sovereign
[30:21] but
[30:58] thank you
[31:02] and I believe it
[31:06] I believe that with all of my heart
[31:11] I'm going to be reading a quote from the
[31:13] prophet
[31:15] it's in the great warrior David they say
[31:17] nothing and it says
[31:22] he was elected yeah it was called
[31:30] he wasn't he didn't Place himself
[31:33] but God placed it
[31:35] he was elected
[31:38] he was called from
[31:40] caring for the Sheep to be a king
[31:44] that was anointed and placed
[31:50] look he says Abraham Isaac Jacob Jose
[31:55] Joseph Abraham
[31:59] elections perfection
[32:42] the election
[33:22] blessed be the Lord
[33:24] they say
[33:26] it says
[33:46] and then you you heard his uh you took
[33:49] heed to his call
[33:52] then he poured the anointing oil on you
[34:09] you all know that
[34:11] they say
[34:22] in a symbolic form amen amen
[34:27] I hope that you're able to capture them
[34:30] Fresco the prophet says that this came
[34:33] fresh
[34:35] he poured the oil on him
[34:39] and it ran from the top of his head down
[34:41] to the souls of is
[34:55] God is going to give us
[35:03] God doesn't give anything happens
[35:11] God is good Brothers
[35:17] that is how God
[35:24] he simply baptizes him with it
[35:30] oh hello
[35:32] anointing him with a spirit
[35:38] notice when that uh Spirit came on him
[35:41] he was positionally placed as a king
[35:45] Christ
[35:53] in Christ Jesus
[35:55] as kings is
[36:00] correct that is
[36:04] you receive the Holy Spirit
[37:03] he never consulted the prophets
[37:06] perfection
[37:18] foreign
[37:32] [Laughter]
[38:28] may God bless you
[38:31] foreign
[38:31] [Applause]
[38:53] verse 11.
[38:57] we're speaking on the great warrior
[38:59] David I mean
[39:01] hither
[39:36] and he sent and brought him in
[40:11] and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon
[40:13] David from that day forward
[40:31] through 45. adavi
[40:36] and the Philistine said unto David
[40:40] my dog that thou cometh to me with
[40:43] staves
[40:45] and the first time cursed David by his
[40:48] gods
[40:53] now notice this and the Philistine said
[40:55] to David
[40:59] come to me and I will give thy flesh
[41:01] unto the fowls of the year and to the
[41:03] Beast of the field
[41:06] then said David to the Philistines
[41:24] the armies of Israel
[41:38] [Music]
[41:40] we've read in the first part the first
[41:43] scripture Israel
[41:54] was chosen by the men
[42:53] so let's keep reading is
[42:56] [Music]
[43:03] amen amen foreign
[43:41] so he took his I mean
[43:44] his statue okay
[44:43] he had experience
[45:09] to challenge the the people of God
[45:13] is
[45:18] they would always say he would always
[45:20] come to challenges
[45:36] so
[45:40] I heard that the voices he heard that he
[45:43] heard
[45:45] that David said I will go and fight
[45:48] against this Goliath
[45:51] so Saul called him
[46:01] from a young person you're a fighter and
[46:05] don't say
[46:17] his armor his breastplate he is
[46:29] he said no no take this off I
[46:33] don't want to go with it
[46:46] I mean
[46:49] [Music]
[46:52] David said I will go and fight and don't
[46:54] say
[46:56] so he went he said you know let me go as
[46:59] I am
[47:00] he took his uh
[47:28] so he put him in his in His Garment
[47:31] his statue I mean
[47:37] the the Shepherds
[47:42] they had honey
[47:46] one of their sheeps got sick
[47:51] they would uh put that uh I mean they
[47:55] rubbed that honey on that rock on that
[47:56] stone
[47:58] and the Sheep would come
[48:02] lick that honey
[48:05] but he would also lick it
[48:10] is
[48:15] it's Jesus Christ
[48:24] when we have trials
[48:26] go to Jesus Christ
[48:32] our brother said David
[48:35] try to take it
[48:38] I mean
[48:42] before doing any Ife
[48:55] is and faith is revelation I mean
[48:59] Ife in English
[49:02] faith and English is five letters
[49:16] and now honey represents the word
[49:20] that is the word of God
[49:25] all the revelation of his words
[49:28] he was going to fight against David
[49:31] in the name of God
[49:35] so he he continued
[49:38] and he got that stone
[49:41] and when Goliath came or approached him
[49:45] he he threw it
[49:47] with that with that stone
[49:50] with the Revelation
[49:53] what is your problem
[49:59] it doesn't matter how big
[50:01] God is
[50:06] let's continue forward let's continue
[50:09] forward
[50:26] a little bit all here
[50:36] Hermano
[50:43] so then David
[50:46] went and killed Goliath I mean
[50:58] that the Living God
[51:01] and that's how they got more strings
[51:27] let's get it
[51:31] glory to God
[51:34] usually I preach in Spanish
[51:38] but but today I want to I want to truly
[51:41] bring out what I got but
[51:45] God bless you all hello
[51:48] I really truly miss each and every one
[51:50] of you
[51:52] I've been gone for a while
[51:56] but let me start by saying this
[52:01] without a soul
[52:03] there couldn't be a David
[52:06] we know how the prophet describes it
[52:09] we know without night
[52:12] we couldn't appreciate today
[52:15] without sickness we couldn't appreciate
[52:18] our health amen
[52:21] who can remind me the title of this of
[52:24] this theme
[52:30] yes man called by God
[52:33] you want to make sure you're all here
[52:36] they say your body can't be here
[52:40] you might can be somewhere else
[52:43] it happens to the best of us
[52:46] but tonight
[52:51] it depends on me dependent at me what
[52:54] mentality they bring What attitude I
[52:57] come with
[52:59] do I come with an attitude of
[53:01] expectations
[53:10] elected by God's choice
[53:16] he likes when people know what they're
[53:19] talking about
[53:22] no matter what age who they are where
[53:25] they're from
[53:26] the sand and by the grace of God we have
[53:28] this great message
[54:09] a prophet says that the scriptures have
[54:11] compound meanings
[54:16] so there's different ways you can take
[54:18] at it
[54:22] and tonight I want to bring in the
[54:25] character of Saul yes
[54:29] anointing upon someone
[54:34] because I was hearing a preacher one
[54:36] time says
[54:42] I'm a big man Spirit as soon as
[54:45] oh me look at me
[54:48] you know we we and we know in the in
[54:51] first Samuel chapter 8 is
[54:54] when the people go to Samuel puello
[55:00] as Samuel tells them what type of King
[55:02] they're gonna get is
[55:05] and if you go there in chapter 8 verse
[55:08] 17 this is
[55:20] Jesus for his army
[55:29] but I want to bring you tonight the type
[55:31] of David
[55:34] type of spirit that David has
[55:38] it said he was a man unto God's Own
[55:41] Heart
[55:44] and we can see election perfectly there
[55:47] because I started to think about that
[55:51] he started to say okay
[55:57] so if God saw something intakes it used
[56:00] you know it's not his heart right
[56:03] and that was the reason why he called
[56:05] him
[56:06] same thing for me
[56:12] that was worthy yeah
[56:17] worthy to bring out
[56:21] and maybe many times it happens to all
[56:24] of us
[56:25] we're
[56:26] humanos we know ourselves is
[56:37] but one thing is that we try to have the
[56:40] mind of God many of the times
[56:47] God sees more than we do
[56:50] and God always sees
[56:53] what you can't see look you said the
[56:56] great Shepherd El Gran pastor but again
[56:59] I go back
[57:00] I want to give you a couple examples
[57:04] of what God saw in David
[57:09] before maybe himself he never saw
[57:16] David knew that God was with him
[57:20] when I go back without a soul there
[57:23] couldn't be a David
[57:25] and without the devil attacking us day
[57:27] and night
[57:29] we're gonna find out
[57:33] we can notice what God's telling us
[57:37] why we're here
[57:39] you may say oh he called my parents
[57:43] oh my parents moved here
[57:47] it was never me it was never mind
[57:50] we ever thought maybe God called your
[57:53] parents to get to you
[57:58] who are you to say
[58:01] how God works
[58:04] he could have looked over me many years
[58:07] ago
[58:39] God bless my brothers what an amazing
[58:41] job they did
[58:43] you know but we look here in this in
[58:46] this scene now I'm going to take you
[58:50] are you with me here tonight
[58:52] I know maybe maybe some of you are
[58:55] thinking about what's going to happen
[58:56] after that
[58:58] but my God loves to work in this order
[59:04] and if you're expecting something
[59:06] you're gonna put God in a time frame is
[59:16] to David
[59:19] behold my elder daughter yeah
[59:26] who will I give thee to wife only with
[59:29] be thou Valiant for me
[59:33] and fight the Lord's battles
[59:36] and then it says
[59:39] but in the new king no King uh New King
[59:43] James Version it says
[59:55] let now my hand be upon him
[59:59] but let the hand of the Philistines be
[1:00:01] upon him
[1:00:06] so I had upon him
[1:00:08] and then look at the type of David
[1:00:12] now I believe each and every one of us
[1:00:15] have inside of us
[1:00:18] again throughout all the characters in
[1:00:20] The Bible
[1:00:23] to bring out what they had inside of
[1:00:25] them
[1:00:27] a time of pressure
[1:00:31] a hard time
[1:00:40] what is my life
[1:00:42] my father's family in Israel
[1:00:45] that I should be son-in-law of the king
[1:00:48] foreign
[1:01:48] samosa
[1:02:05] Amen to show what truly you have inside
[1:02:08] of us
[1:02:10] because you have to believe it first
[1:02:12] what you said
[1:02:13] you have to believe it no one else can
[1:02:17] show you
[1:02:18] you know no one else can tell you where
[1:02:20] you are
[1:02:22] only yourself
[1:02:24] but it's
[1:02:26] in a sense of way
[1:02:29] it's also up to God
[1:02:33] and if it's in your heart's true desire
[1:02:36] is
[1:02:38] to see a part of God inside of you
[1:02:42] and God will set up the situation
[1:02:45] the area
[1:02:47] well he will show you
[1:02:50] that part of God is that David inside of
[1:02:54] you
[1:02:55] if we keep on going
[1:02:58] it says again in verse 25 now in the
[1:03:01] same chapter and then
[1:03:02] I want you to follow me
[1:03:06] shall ye say to David
[1:03:10] the king desires not any Dowry but a
[1:03:13] hundred foreskins
[1:03:17] oh forgive me I jumped ahead of myself
[1:03:19] I'm going back to verse 21.
[1:03:26] forgive him and now right here
[1:03:29] we can see that saw is about to give his
[1:03:32] youngest daughter it is
[1:03:42] I will give him
[1:03:45] that she may be a snare
[1:03:49] and at the hand of the Philistines may
[1:03:52] be against him
[1:03:58] Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law in
[1:04:02] the one of the twain
[1:04:08] speak these words in the ears of David
[1:04:14] and David said
[1:04:16] to you a light thing to be a king's
[1:04:22] son-in-laws
[1:04:24] seeing that I am a poor man
[1:04:27] and lightly esteemed is
[1:04:38] but I want you to look at this picture
[1:04:42] again a certain characteristic that we
[1:04:45] should all strive foreign
[1:05:30] a man unto God's Own hearts
[1:05:35] when they pulled Jesus
[1:06:15] but when the word of God says
[1:06:19] and again this is not an easy pill to
[1:06:22] swallow noise
[1:06:26] honor thy father thy mother
[1:06:29] all the days of your life
[1:06:31] again it's not easy
[1:06:36] but it's needed that was necessary of
[1:06:39] that anointing in which David had
[1:06:42] in order to do all those things
[1:06:47] my brother said it earlier
[1:06:50] that anointing the oil is
[1:06:53] represents the Holy Spirit
[1:06:56] and only with the Holy Spirit is
[1:07:00] can we break through those things
[1:07:10] true self-dominium
[1:07:14] but again
[1:07:17] of that anointing
[1:07:19] a change of a mindset
[1:07:22] change of Nature
[1:07:25] and only can we find it in his holy
[1:07:28] spirit
[1:07:38] and tonight
[1:07:41] I believe each and every one of us have
[1:07:43] been elected
[1:07:46] for a purpose
[1:07:49] this message itself is
[1:07:52] for an elect as far as
[1:07:57] because it says behold I will send you
[1:08:00] but can he says
[1:08:03] Elijah the prophet and Prophet Elias you
[1:08:06] who's you know so as me yeah
[1:08:16] the weapons
[1:08:19] the armor in which we have to put on Las
[1:08:21] amas
[1:08:27] come against us every single day
[1:08:31] throwing Spears against us
[1:08:34] so throwing things against us throwing
[1:08:37] us my things in our minds
[1:08:40] things and all your things things in our

[1:10:23] can you just simply ask God Dios
[1:10:29] I don't understand it all night I don't
[1:10:32] get it
[1:10:34] but there's nothing inside of me pushing
[1:10:38] there's something scratching inside my
[1:10:40] heart
[1:10:41] that every time I try to do something
[1:10:44] common
[1:10:47] I try to be common
[1:10:49] I try to be modern content I just can't
[1:10:53] fit in ain't no no identification it

[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:57] inside my big glorified
[1:35:01] amen amen
[1:35:08] okay
[1:35:17] I believe that like David
[1:35:20] we have many enemies
[1:35:23] David had many enemies
[1:35:29] I believe if a man
[1:35:32] apart from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:35] as many enemies was David
[1:35:39] from all sides they wanted to kill him
[1:35:44] but he was the chosen one from God
[1:35:49] majority of Psalms
[1:35:52] David writes about his enemies
[1:35:59] something in David
[1:36:01] um
[1:36:04] Corazon
[1:36:12] we say the great thing about David is
[1:36:13] that he had the heart
[1:36:15] like the will of God
[1:36:20] his heart was like the Lord
[1:36:24] many times we believe
[1:36:26] songs
[1:36:40] but I believe one of the things the Lord
[1:36:42] loved about David is
[1:36:46] that David had no fear of his enemies
[1:36:55] a
[1:37:01] sanginario not thirsty
[1:37:05] um
[1:37:07] the first king Israel of Israel was so
[1:37:14] you know why God got rid of him
[1:37:18] he couldn't kill his enemies
[1:37:23] I heard his heart too much
[1:37:28] he believed it was better
[1:37:31] to keep the king of the
[1:37:39] and not to kill everyone who God told
[1:37:42] him to
[1:37:53] the enemies of the Lord
[1:37:57] he wanted someone who was not a coward
[1:38:02] you wanted
[1:38:05] someone who wanted to get rid
[1:38:08] of
[1:38:09] all those who came against the Lord
[1:38:23] he was a warrior
[1:38:28] kill the enemies
[1:38:39] just spoken against this God is
[1:38:46] when he was about to decapitate him
[1:38:50] I don't believe they gave him any weird
[1:38:52] feelings
[1:38:57] foreign
[1:38:59] he was fearful of cutting heads
[1:39:05] like the heart of God because he had no
[1:39:10] fear he had no fear okay he was not a
[1:39:14] coward
[1:39:16] and so so I mean that lets me know
[1:39:21] but if I want to be that way
[1:39:45] all your enemies
[1:39:52] we have to not have fear
[1:39:55] and
[1:39:58] God is with us
[1:40:00] amen Amigos
