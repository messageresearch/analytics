[24:24] a
[24:41] I Know Thy works and tribulation and

[24:55] are the synagogue of
[25:01] satanos
[25:04] is
[25:12] if you're none of those things without
[25:14] shall suffer behold the devil shall cast
[25:16] some of you into prison that he may be
[25:18] tried and ye shall have tribulation 10
[25:20] days be thou faithful unto death and I
[25:22] will give thee a Crown of Life let us
[25:25] pray foreign
[26:38] in the Book of Revelation
[26:42] which is the Smyrna Church age
[26:49] we're speaking in a time of Christianity
[26:55] where there was a Great Tribulation
[26:59] great suffering persecution great
[27:02] persecution
[27:07] they say that uh one other there was
[27:10] when there was that the 19 Council
[27:13] that happened in the next stage
[27:58] the majority of the Christian Church
[28:01] went through a Great Tribulation Paso
[28:04] program persecution through great
[28:05] persecution they killed them and El
[28:08] Tiempo
[28:10] masstoria Cristiana in the bloodiest
[28:12] time of Christianity
[28:15] were being
[28:22] it was one of the most dangerous things
[28:24] throughout the world's history
[28:27] God is speaking to them
[28:29] in
[28:31] these verses
[28:34] God is sending the message to them
[28:38] is
[28:51] our faithful unto death
[28:56] now be thou faithful unto death
[29:02] I get my title out of the Dead those
[29:05] words
[29:07] because brother Branham says it like
[29:09] this he says
[29:13] this reminds me of the marriage vows
[29:21] you'll be faithful until death do you
[29:24] part
[29:25] it's a election or choosing
[29:31] and we'll be speaking with the title
[29:33] virtue chooses the harder way
[29:37] chooses
[29:39] the harder way Dios
[29:42] [Applause]
[29:43] Dios
[29:45] uh
[29:49] now God is is a God he is
[29:56] the Bible says that God's wisdom is very
[29:58] different than man's Wisdom
[30:00] and the wisdom of God
[30:05] not only does it allow suffering
[30:08] tribulation and persecution
[30:12] but it's part of God's plan is
[30:17] part of God's design
[30:19] that his children
[30:22] would be tried
[30:24] there's no other way
[30:28] there's no other there's no escaping
[30:30] from it
[30:32] it's not an easy way out for the child
[30:35] of God
[30:36] it does not exist
[30:38] the one that is
[30:45] foreign
[31:53] no
[32:19] [Applause]
[33:32] [Applause]
[33:52] muchacher foreign
[33:58] Lord will have great Treasures
[34:01] that don't want to suffer
[34:05] will God have great choice
[34:16] this is so fundamental crucial or
[34:19] crucial
[34:21] do you want Treasures in Heaven
[34:23] if you want to be rich in God
[34:27] there's no
[34:29] listen there's no other way
[34:57] produces treasure amen
[35:01] I want you to remember that
[35:04] that's right brother
[35:06] tribulation produces treasure
[35:11] all right
[35:15] now I'm going to continue reading on the
[35:18] Smyrna churches
[35:21] speaks on second Timothy 4.
[35:24] he says without watching all things
[35:31] do the work of an evangelists
[35:34] make full proof of thy Ministries
[35:43] when the church allowed herself to move
[35:45] away from the original like Adam and Eve
[35:52] this is important
[35:55] is
[36:01] when the original was changed
[36:04] now he's speaking on this church
[36:09] then he says there is no strength in her
[36:11] yeah
[36:13] she has become a monstrosity
[36:21] the minute the church moved toward a
[36:24] form and ceremony yes
[36:47] she changed to a powerless people
[36:50] no no this virtue means a strength or
[36:53] power
[36:54] virtue means power
[36:57] virtue means
[37:01] notice what took the strength away
[37:04] notice
[37:10] they were left without strength
[37:14] apparently they were a monstrosity
[37:19] they have great buildings
[37:28] good preachers
[37:30] but they have no virtue they have no
[37:33] power not yet they have they look like
[37:38] they don't have what the Church of God
[37:40] should have Lo Mas Fuerte is
[37:46] the power of the Holy ghosts
[37:52] [Applause]
[38:02] [Applause]
[38:20] [Applause]
[38:23] but I have little of the power of God
[38:29] [Applause]
[38:44] [Applause]
[38:57] and follow me
[38:59] right brother and the hollow La Cruz
[39:01] they have left the cross
[39:06] and acquires and emotions
[39:09] like less the church has left their
[39:12] cross yes sir Los cristianos the
[39:16] Christians have left the cross
[39:20] yes
[39:29] as a Living Sacrifice
[39:36] Flores
[39:49] produce a church without power
[40:03] to us today
[40:06] God is speaking to us foreign
[41:00] why
[41:23] we all have advising and criticisms
[41:27] few people have Solutions
[41:29] a church without power
[41:53] or our character
[41:57] there's no character
[42:02] because we want everything easy
[42:10] that's why we're so poor in character
[42:21] a person with a true character is
[42:25] it's like as Roman 8 35 says
[42:31] who shall separate us from the love of
[42:33] Christ
[42:39] tribulation or distress or persecution
[42:41] or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[42:43] as it is written
[42:47] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[42:50] long
[42:52] we are counted as sheep for the
[42:54] slaughter
[42:57] in
[43:02] in
[43:03] all these things
[43:11] and all these things
[43:14] and all these things
[43:16] we are more than conquerors
[43:20] how do you become a conqueror you know
[43:23] these things
[43:33] [Applause]
[43:54] all these things
[43:56] we are more than conquerors
[43:59] hey man
[44:02] Hallelujah
[44:08] for which I am certain
[44:10] I'm persuaded that neither yes nor life
[44:13] nor angels or principalities
[44:25] nor any other creature
[44:28] shall be able to separate us from the
[44:32] love of God
[44:35] which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[44:39] foreign
[45:04] and so forth like that
[45:18] you're made rich
[45:20] through
[45:26] this
[45:27] those tribulations
[45:40] you're made Rich through
[45:45] there
[45:46] those tribulations
[45:54] foreign
[46:08] it strengthens it
[46:10] is
[46:13] always it strengthens the church
[46:17] always strength is
[46:20] always strengthens the child of God
[46:24] in tribulations
[46:32] but you're rich
[46:38] one time they asked T.S Lewis
[46:41] a great
[46:43] evangelisto suffering why do the
[46:46] righteous suffer
[46:47] they asked them the question
[46:50] he replied why not
[46:54] they're the only ones who can take it
[47:02] Mundo
[47:04] estas
[47:05] although the world is full of suffering
[47:13] that's the great thing
[47:17] it is also foreign
[47:21] of the overcoming of it
[47:23] [Music]
[47:26] yeah yesterday and that's the Glorious
[47:28] thing
[47:30] got a loud suffering
[47:33] in order to see the overcomer
[47:39] there's a famous man
[47:43] perhaps you know perhaps you don't uh
[47:47] is
[47:48] somebody that studies
[47:52] his name is Stephen uh Hawkins Hawking
[47:55] yeah
[47:57] um
[48:04] and it has uh
[48:08] scientific problems
[48:12] very famous and he'll be he'll be known
[48:14] in history for forever
[48:19] Una syndrome he was diagnosed with a
[48:23] syndrome ALS syndrome ALS
[48:27] um
[48:32] it took his life he died not that long
[48:35] ago
[48:36] if I recall
[48:39] um
[48:43] that syndrome
[48:44] [Music]
[48:47] it bound him to a wheelchair for years
[48:58] and think
[49:02] he couldn't even speak
[49:07] and the way that he was able to
[49:09] communicate
[49:12] [Music]
[49:14] was through a machine that they put in
[49:16] his eyes
[49:19] a little bit of movement in his fingers
[49:22] on the tips of his fingers
[49:28] it was too weak to write
[49:32] he was unable to eat by himself he
[49:36] couldn't even comb his hair
[49:38] he couldn't even fix just his glasses
[49:42] somebody had to do those things for him
[49:47] um
[49:49] Hawkins said
[49:52] okay
[50:01] he had little interest in life
[50:08] he called it an existence without
[50:10] purpose pointless existence well
[50:13] pointless existence
[50:15] he spent his time aboard
[50:19] he drank a lot yes
[50:22] he did little work
[50:26] then he realized he had this he found
[50:28] out he had the syndrome
[50:30] and they told him he wouldn't live of
[50:32] more than two years
[50:36] then after the shock he had received to
[50:38] do this
[50:40] his life became very positive
[50:49] to have been happier
[50:52] Affliction after he was afflicted
[50:56] then before
[51:02] they asked him how that could be
[51:04] understood
[51:11] when one's expectations are reduced to
[51:14] zero the sentence
[51:19] he said one really appreciates
[51:21] everything that one does have
[51:23] in other words
[51:27] happiness in life
[51:29] is determined in part
[51:35] by what a person anticipates from it
[51:39] to a man like Hawking
[51:42] Pronto I thought he would die soon
[51:44] quickly
[51:46] significado everything takes on meaning
[51:51] a sunrise
[51:57] or the laughter of children
[52:02] suddenly each small pleasure
[52:06] becomes precious
[52:08] by contrast
[52:12] those who believe alive
[52:17] [Applause]
[52:20] Gente
[52:22] quesmas in Feliz are often discontented
[52:27] even with its finest gifts
[52:32] a man said this is
[52:35] that was unable to to speak even
[52:39] he did more with his life
[52:44] when he was sick
[52:49] then when he was healthy
[52:52] my mind
[53:00] Gloria
[53:06] is I was reading
[53:13] there are almost all the Bible
[53:17] all the songs
[53:21] all of Paul's Epistles
[53:26] we're written through a time of
[53:28] suffering
[53:29] the greatest the best songs
[53:34] were written when David was running
[53:38] with God for his life
[53:41] the greatest
[53:44] cries forsaken
[53:52] [Applause]
[54:31] sometimes with pain in their lives
[54:35] even the Book of Revelation
[54:38] We Know It Was Written
[54:43] inspired when John was found on the Isle
[54:45] of Patmos solo alone
[54:48] when they wanted to kill him
[54:56] why is it that in pain
[54:59] because it is because it's in pain
[55:02] it's in pain
[55:05] when God gets the best out of his
[55:07] children
[55:11] yes
[55:20] [Applause]
[55:35] that's the devil
[56:16] that's the devil speaking Brothers
[56:26] the Holy Spirit to become dormant in US
[56:31] is
[56:34] the devil telling you to just be still
[56:36] there on the
[56:39] beaches
[56:51] with the preachers
[57:02] take it easy
[57:06] Hallelujah
[57:11] but I want to tell you one thing
[57:14] is
[57:17] suffering has very little effect in
[57:19] somebody
[57:20] until
[57:24] that person chooses it themselves
[57:32] there has to come a time
[57:35] where the son or daughter of God is
[57:49] [Applause]
[57:51] not something that somebody else
[57:57] repentance
[58:10] Jesus Christ
[58:13] nobody takes my life
[58:16] I'll lay it down myself
[58:52] because he chose it
[59:14] and that made the whole difference
[59:18] the great thing wasn't that he was
[59:20] crucial
[59:23] the great thing was that he chose to be
[59:25] crucified
[59:27] that's right brother
[59:36] Hebrews 11 24 says
[59:39] by faith Moses
[59:42] when he was come to years
[59:46] refused to be called the son of
[59:48] Pharaoh's daughter
[59:50] choosing rather
[59:54] to suffer Affliction with the people of
[59:56] God
[59:59] then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:00:04] seasoning the reproach
[1:00:07] of Christ
[1:00:10] greater riches in the treasures in Egypt
[1:00:14] for he had respect unto the recompense
[1:00:16] of the rewards
[1:00:18] he chose
[1:00:20] Moses chose
[1:00:23] he made the choosing
[1:00:28] he was told
[1:00:31] in the message you're standing in the
[1:00:34] bridge
[1:00:36] and he shares it on other occasions
[1:00:39] how this interpreter
[1:00:44] how this brother had spoken tongues
[1:00:47] an interpreter interpreted it
[1:00:52] and this was the message that was spoken
[1:00:55] the spoken tongues this is what it was
[1:00:57] related
[1:01:02] because thou has chosen
[1:01:06] because you chose it
[1:01:08] because you made the election
[1:01:12] because you decided
[1:01:18] because you made a Consciousness
[1:01:21] because you had the options
[1:01:27] you chose this or that
[1:01:31] but because you have children
[1:01:36] the harder way
[1:01:40] thou has walked in your own choosing
[1:01:43] you're not there for a sin I didn't
[1:01:45] force you this is God says you're not
[1:01:48] therefore said I didn't obligate
[1:01:51] nobody forced you
[1:01:54] that's what he made you do it
[1:02:03] that's the greatest battle in this day
[1:02:05] is
[1:02:06] that we have the elections
[1:02:12] perhaps they didn't have the uh
[1:02:15] foreign
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:03:15] the Book of James says
[1:03:19] one of verse two
[1:03:21] my brethren
[1:03:23] County
[1:03:26] versus when you fall into diverse
[1:03:28] Temptations
[1:03:32] knowing this at the triangle for your
[1:03:34] faith work is patience
[1:03:37] but let patience
[1:03:40] you may be perfect and entire
[1:03:44] wanting nothing
[1:03:48] when can you be happy in Tribulation
[1:03:51] when you choose it
[1:03:55] can you be joyful in tribulations
[1:04:00] come and find the riches of God
[1:04:05] to suffer with God
[1:04:08] then to enjoy the world
[1:04:15] where does it become a joy and a
[1:04:17] privilege to have long hair foreign
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:35] [Applause]
[1:04:46] [Applause]
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:28] to the difficult way
[1:05:40] s
[1:05:45] had just gone through a great trial
[1:05:55] he said that
[1:05:56] he had just lost his job
[1:06:01] a great Fortune as well and his home
[1:06:06] and to add to that
[1:06:09] his wife had just passed away
[1:06:14] even then he tried to keep stand firm in
[1:06:18] his faith
[1:06:20] that was all he had left
[1:06:23] one day as he was walking outside
[1:06:26] trying to find employment
[1:06:31] foreign work
[1:06:41] we're working on Stones
[1:06:45] he was shaping a stone for this a great
