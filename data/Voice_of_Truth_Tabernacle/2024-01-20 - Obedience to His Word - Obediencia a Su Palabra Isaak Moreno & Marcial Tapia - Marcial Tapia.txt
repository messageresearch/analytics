[Music] amen I'm really happy to be in the house of the Lord amen it's a privilege to be here bless all those that are watching through the internet brother from californ many brothers from Mexico and just all around the world um I'm gonna ask you guys to open your Bibles to Luke 2 we'll be reading verse 51 and 52 amen we're still speaking on young Jesus amen our title for tonight is um obedience to his word amen and it says like this and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these things in her heart 2 and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man let's bow our heads in prayer Lord we give you thanks for this wonderful day you've given us to come and hear your word I ask that you may use me and my brother that will be preaching with me that we may speak the right things you may use our mouths our voice and that just may be a blessing to at least one Soul here and most of all to the youth this is a youth service and we just want the youth to rejoice in the word Lord we ask that you may be with us help us and guide us uh we ask this on Your Name Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated uh today we'll be speaking about [Music] obedience and as we read in Luke we see that God was obedient to his mother or his parents whenever they went back to go pick him up after they had lost them um I believe one of God's love languages is obedience I believe he loves obedience you see it says in the Bible obedience is better than sacrifice and Jesus was a perfect example to this you see um he made it very clear that his Focus was on obeying his father at first you see he's in the temple and he's obeying what his father told him but when his Earthly parents come back to pick him up to take him back home his obedience was there as well you see Jesus was human just as we are um he had Earthly duties you see but he was still God but the thing that amazes me is that even though he was God in a in a flesh form even though he's the god of gods he's omnipotent he's everything right he was still able to come down and obey his Earthly parents you see it says in the Bible the first um the first commandment with promise is to obey your parents father and mother you see and we see that Jesus was doing that I want to read John 8:29 and it says and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for I do always you see it says for I do always those things that please him that word always really amazes me it doesn't say sometimes but it says always always those things that please him Jesus always did what pleased his father he never once question never once complained like a lot of the times we do right you know I'm going to put myself I can't speak for any other youth see sometimes my parents parents ask me to do something I want to complain about it and I Gran and moan I get upset I don't want to do it I want to do it at my time you see but Jesus we see here he never questioned anything he never said I'll do it later he never said on my time he said no I'll always do it and he went with Mary White when she when they found them you see this attitude of obedience was forged into him even as a young man it was seared into him at age 12 to 13 you see being 12 or 13 I remember I mean I don't remember completely I know I wasn't completely obedient I had my struggles um you know I didn't I was a gamer back then even though my mom didn't let me get on too much but I remember she would put a time limit she would put like 30 minutes and in my mind I didn't think 30 minutes was enough it was enough for me to play enough what I wanted to play and then she jumped it up to an hour it still wasn't enough for me it was never enough for me you see that's just a little example but Jesus you see what amazes me is that he wasn't playing with the kids he playing video games no they didn't probably have video games back then they wasn't playing games with the kids he wasn't in the corner crying he wasn't afraid but he was in his father's business you see I imagine him let's bring it to this day let's imagine Jesus here in this Temple you see with our pastor with the ministers my dad Marshal all the ministers here of great knowledge here in the temple with all the brothers talking about the word of great knowledge not only not only um not only um asking questions but we see that it also says answering as such a young age you see I believe in this uh day now believe if some of the you know people walked in here and see such a young kid wanting to go to church you know other kids coming in they might have laughed at them I don't think they would have been like oh let's go join them let's go talk about the word now I believe that a lot of kids especially youth they would have been in their own thing going to [Music] parties games going out but not with the word of God but Jesus was obedient and staying in his father's business you see and that word always um or excuse me I wanted what I wanted to say uh Jesus chose to be obedient in Hebrews 57 or in Hebrews chapter 5 verse 7-9 it says Christ in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to serve him from death and was heard in that he feared it says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered it says and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all those who obey him you see we look at the passage here while Jesus certainly prayed it says with the loud cry and tears it wasn't just a prayer a regular prayer and the garden of Sesame and I'm convinced that wasn't the only time he he suffered I believe he suffered more than once I'm sure as a young boy Jesus suffered because he obeyed you see he suffered because he was with Joseph and Mary and because he chose to obey he obeyed his father instead of following the crowd I'm I'm sure he was tormented he was laughed at you see maybe even by his own Brothers you see they were a big family and I mean you see a lot of times how would we feel you know if we have siblings if you seen your sibling and he was just the perfect man the perfect sibling never did anything wrong oby I bet his older brothers would have got jealous you see even just being at church we see someone doing good and we get jealous but why not start doing it why not start obeying Why not start following in those footsteps we get upset because someone is leading the way someone is giving us an example and we get jealous because they're doing the right thing it's funny sometimes because then when they're not doing the wrong thing the right thing we start to talk about them even so which one are we going to choose are we going to support them in the good are we going to support them or just laugh at them when they're doing bad um I want to read a quote in the [Music] message the Lan Church age um in paragraph 108 it says in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of God and then he reads Hebrews Hebrews 57-8 which we read uh earlier uh and then he says what was he obedient to the word of God you see Jesus was obedient to the word of God that's why he was blessed that's why he had what he had a lot of the times we want to be blessed right but we can't even be obedient and a lot of times you know I heard something earlier today a lot um a preacher was saying um a lot of the times we think obedience is you know as a preacher a young preacher or anything is listening to 100 sermons having all these messages all these notes in your b or in your Bible IP but that's not what obedience is that doesn't show anything but your the thing that's going to show your obedience the way you live your fruits that you produce when you're alone with that door closed what are you really doing when you're around your friends you see cuz even here in the church we're not perfect amen but really what are you putting as your priority are you putting God first are you putting the things of this world so just because you know the the word God would rather you be obedient than you know the whole word bible the whole message amen amen I want to read another quote of our brother brandham um God's only provided place of worship says now the word Deuteronomy the word itself means two laws the word de Deuteronomy and and God has two laws the two laws one of them is disobedient to the word and die and the other one is obedience to the word and live that's the two laws and Deuteronomy means those two laws they have both been absolutely displayed to us in the scripture one of them is death and the other is life life and death God Deals Only in life Satan only in death and these were was display to the word publicly publicly openly before every eye and there is no excuse for it one of them was displayed on the Mount Si when the law was given which condemned the whole human race to death the other one was given on Mount Calvary that brought the whole Human Race To Life when the penalty was paid in Jesus Christ you see we could choose obedience which is going to give us life or we could choose Disobedience to be disobedient which is going to bring us death amen amen and you [Music] see um Jesus Christ the son of God he was still a human being and it amazes me because he was subject to a a carpenter and his wife and if the Lord was obedient to a carpenter and his wife what makes us any better what makes us any better to disrespect our Heavenly our Earthly fathers we should have that respect to our parents young or old um you know I remember this kid in my soccer team uh being at a away game one [Music] day I was I was astonished the way he treated his wife I mean his his mother excuse me if I would have ever spoke to my mom like that I know I would have been smacked around I remember he was cussing at his mom left and right and I remember just standing there I was just hearing them and I was just thinking how can a young man this or be so um how do I say it disobedient I guess have those type of words that come out of his mouth and tell them to his mother I couldn't imagine myself telling those to my mother or even seeing you know our pastor my father not even one speaking to another person like that that's how bad this was imagine Jesus if he was disobedient in those ways imagine if he didn't care imagine if Jesus was disobedient put yourself in Jesus's shoes have you been obedient if Jesus was in your [Music] body because that was God's son right but he still knew all things but put yourself in Jesus's body imagine if I was Jesus what would people think about me the way I live the way I portray myself now put your name there you see because we represent Jesus every day you don't have to repes you don't have to be Jesus to represent him I just want to really have you guys think about it a little more and you guys go home with a little thought if you guys were Jesus and I'm going to leave you guys with this if my brother could come up if you guys were Jesus what would you guys portray to this world but they find you you know I know we're not going to be perfect but you could tell from a person that's trying to a person that doesn't care at all would they see that you're obedient or would they see that you don't care and just want to be disobedient in your own ways think about that and just reanalyze your life go through your closet talking spiritually go through your room go through the places that you don't don't want God to to go through or that you're not letting them in and just analyze yourself God bless [Applause] you amen God bless you Brothers you can open your Bibles in the book ofe Luke chapter 2 verse 48 God is good brother amen it's great to see you and we send greetings everyone watching through the internet and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee Sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wi ye not that I must be about my father's business may the Lord our blessing to the reading of his [Music] word we'll be getting started with our message obedience to God's word obedience to God's word thank our brother Isaac for for sharing the word with us we're going to ask God to help us because what we need today is for God's word come inside our hearts truly we need God's word penetrates as the deepest part in our hearts it can wake up that it can wake us up in the time that we live in we know we live in difficult we know these are tough times for the Youth live we've heard God's word we heard great messages we have a pastor that has fed us and every every we have too much for but what I want this evening is for that word that word can pierce the deepest part of our hearts and when we leave through these doors we can leave medita what God's word told us tonight so youth if you can take something tonight is obedience to his word I believe with all my heart that if one [Applause] young can obey in the Earthly things his parents they will be be blessed I believe with all my heart they willed what Gody your mother and father and your days in this earth will be that's a scripture with a promise now if we are OB to our Earthly fathers that comes with a promise and how much more we obey God's word how many promises can and one of the reasons why the devil God's word because are able to see God's glory in our own lives am amen Breen how many youth are here tonight now youth if you can connect the holy spirit this evening and don't just hear listen to oneing this year I don't want to see this year like another year I want this year and have new to see my God even in my life in my brothers in this church in these Services the Holy Spirit move freely and that his children can worship Him freely yes brother don't be afraid why are we afraid there's no reason to be afraid God is with us us come on youth look what the devil is putting this time is Fear yes he knows that he can put fear in you we won't lift our hands we won't worship Him freely yes brother we should know one thing that his worth is Obed manifest himself in you children needs are youth young ladies and young men stand up for God because God hasit every one of you I Rejoice I rejoice when God uses because they are the continuation of the Holy Spirit yes brother look when the youth came to the youngest is Al say it because he's a p he surprised me because he prepared he was led by the Holy Spirit now the Lord Jesus Christ at an early age he was in the temple this young man was with teachers speaking about the word nowden a young man he was the same about God's word and look he was explaining that at 12 years3 when they were transitioning to be an adult so that's when they would take a responsibility of maturity yes brother and what is maturity take God's word seriously yes speaks about your behavior speaks about who you are who are you you are not children you are not and you should not behave like a bab no brother because if God is with you and if God is with you maturity should happen in your life mat should happen in your life where you take God's word seriously and God is forced to support his word yes youth I respect all I see them like any child I see them God is dealing with you and I receive blessings from God I respect that I see a young man if there's a need to pray for I know God will hear and I have no problem asking any pray for any person why because I believe that God is in his children God is in you see that in yourself you yes look what does obedience in the mean goes beyond receiving and fulfilling orders it's more about a volunteering acception joyful responsible of God's Will and of the Authority by legitimate right he has Upon Us obey with this shows spiritual maturity many times we think obedience oh I need to do it let's change that that shows spiritual maturity and you love you because you love God because you love God I I don't want to serve God for an obligation or because I need to do or because I don't have another or because I'm already here no I want to obey God because I love how I if not I'll because that's our lord Jesus taught us the age of 12 he was obedient look youth we see our own life we've gone through many things we've been hurt by our own parents yes because we make mistakes but God uses everything who love God Jesus growing imag he had a difficult life he had a life of suff Imagine they saw Mar like an brother says now how does that Mak the Lord Jesus they mocked him they mocked him they called him a bastard they didn't know who the father was why time the Lord Jesus lived in so people can laugh at many of the you here they can laugh at the way you oh brother see God the rest do not matter as long as you ho spirit is the with you the world doesn't matter the world God doing with us keep standing walking with him the world will see the love of God in you that's what the worlds true Witness true stand up for God that stand up for him and that God through you yes you imagine time the Lord Jesus Christ was living in there was many too many voices what brother there were too many voices the hear God's voice that's what we many times can't do because there are so many there are evil businesses that we are focused yes sir there are many business the world is filled with everything is business to be in agreement a bus but there are good businesses there are evil businesses the businesses of God the best businesses you can associate those businesses will never disappoint we never disappoint the businesses of those disappoint yes so youth this something do I'm not telling you about something that I'm not asking God for I'm telling you from my heart of something that I'm also trying to do something I want to do in this year is hear God's voice because there are many we all work we all have a circle of friends we all watch we all watch movies we all watch many hear different songs or H we're filled with so many voices that it's hard to hear God's voice it's hard in the time to hear God's voice still sitting in these it's just as hard So Hear God's voice in you this moment in your mind we having different thoughts maybe you're thinking what to do are you going to meet who are you going to talk to what are you going to watch on too many things the interi a very peaceful voice there's God's voice we don't hear it because of all the other voices but if you take some time and succeed to connect with God you will hear his voice hear God's voice constantly speaking is Con talking to our hearts but God also needs a heart that can receive him a heart that can listen to yes brother look I always have several quotes and I never read any that's all rightness youth life is real the fight is real see yes the losses are real and the earnings are real we prepare ourselves should be preparing in God's just like how we prepare in the Earthly don't ignore the spiritual the natural is needed for this Earth need arrive one day with our Lord Jesus Christ if the musicians can come I was listening and I'll be closing with this I like to listen when I have the opportunity Billy gram to listen to brother Billy [Music] Graham and I enjoy it because it's all word and I love his spirit IR [Music] personally it's strange for me to hear other pre I have enough of the message and I have enough from our pastor and I heard this story of a young pilot young female pilot she was displ [Music] playing or I'm sorry she took off and when she was in the sky when she took off when she took off and this and she was in the sky she was lost in clouds she couldn't see anything she began to be afraid she didn't know where she was she realized that she was lost she was too afraid she didn't know where to go she knew if she didn't cry out if no one helped her she could die so she was in a tough situation and she began to cry out she called on her radio for someone to help and finally a man that answered that she never met him she never met him but she knew he knew exactly where she was because of her obedience he guided her to get out of there she knew she didn't take this man's word like a game she took the word an opportunity to leave to be able to live she was very Obed and she followed step by step to leave the situation she was in that's how our lives are used don't take the word let's take God's word seriously take God's word all of our hearts take God's word with love let's take it because that's what will take be with our Lord Jesus Christ come on you if we are sad we are lost is speaking to us this is speaking to us this night just listen to what he says ask him tell him Lord I need you more of you feel your presence I need you to lead me I know you will leave me because he is listening to us [Music] youth I am nothing but his word is everything for us I'm only going and I'm realizing that I'm close in my life I am 37 years old and I'm barely learning what it is to live and living is to serve God with all my heart and Trust he has never left me and will never leave me God will never leave you you God loves you just the way you are God loves you I have no doubt one doubt in my heart that God God comes down when he sees a heart that is humble in his presence bless you Youth and I remind you that God loves us and God wants to use you the Lord bless

Round of [Music] Applause you may be seated amen amen we're happy with God I believe we can all say we can all learn more about obedience we can all be more obedient especially to our God how God humbled himself when they created Mary and Joseph he subjected himself to his own creation he was the he was their creator he was their father but he said like he told John the Baptist we must fulfill all scripture he wanted to give us an example if he could H humble himself to such a point who are we to not humble ourselves and say Lord I can be more obedient I can do your will amen amen we're going to be dis being dismissed we have a few announcements um greetings to all those who watch us through the inter may God bless them also if we have if you have a a letter A Prayer letter if you could return it to the person uh by which you have been or for which you have been praying for this Sunday on the 21st the last day of the fast some are perhaps anxiously uh waiting I have enjoyed it uh so much just be able to spend time with God and we will be finishing it in a very special way taking a communion and doing the washing of the feet I believe it's something we should take seriously uh just taking it not doing it without making things right with the person we may have to get right with with God above all but it's also a serious matter to not take it because it is a sin to not take it as well because it's one of the Commandments that that has been given unto us so when there is an opportunity to take it we should do all things possible partake it because in that we're honoring what Jesus did for us he said to bring it to remember to to to it and he got together with his disciples before giving his life for us and I believe it's it's beautiful for us to gather the family that God has given us and partake of the communion I know there's some that have gone out I'm not 100% certain for all the ones that that went out but there should be a desire to take partake of the communion and take advantage of these times the ones that are here maybe it's not going to be a whole lot but it'll just make it that much more intimate and special to partake of that with the Lord and with one another as well so that God would help us because we need so much [Music] help this world gets diff more difficult every time and we need more of God's help brother BR put it this way see we've gotten to the point where we simply won't be able to make it unless we help one another we just simply won't make it he said we need each other now more than ever he says it in the message thirst we need one another I need you we need each other amen amen that's what the communion is about uh I want to let you know that Sunday will be the last day I I'll be seeing you until I return from colia so it it'll be good to see on Sunday God permits on Tuesday uh I will be heading out to California to be with the nephew of our our brothers [Music] here going M it's the grand the grandson of sister mati that the Lord allowed for him to to go home with him so let's be praying for the family and those that will be heading out there to to the funeral doing a service perhaps I'll return Tuesday and a Wednesday evening nine of us will be departing to Colombia so we'll be praying for that trip as well Wednesday there will be uh there will be small groups in the home if you don't have a place to go on Wednesday let us know so that we would let you know where you can assist amen um on Sunday as well we have a a few baptisms it's a good day to be baptized because we can baptize and then we can take partake of the communion in the evening so we'll fulfill two two Commandments in one day there's a uh a few baptisms we're happy for those that will be getting baptized to be able to support them in that we return from Columbia on the 30th of January it's on a Tuesday and we'll be having service here on Wednesday on Friday the 2 of February it is my birthday be canceling
