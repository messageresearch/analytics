[21:51] God bless you brothers and sisters
[21:54] I greet you in the name of Lord Jesus
[21:57] Christ
[22:00] I want to thank our pastor
[22:03] Pastor for the privilege
[22:06] for allowing me to be up here as well as
[22:08] my brother Gustavo
[22:11] Gustavo I would like to First say um
[22:15] uh to remember keep our brothers in
[22:17] prayer
[22:21] that are in Mexico
[22:23] our pastor may they may God bring them
[22:26] home safe
[22:28] and as well a prayer for Brother John
[22:31] amen
[22:34] I think we we believe in a god that is
[22:38] it's so great
[22:41] that he can do anything
[22:45] just as he left a Lazarus from the dead
[22:50] he can do so with anybody
[22:54] if we can please open our scriptures
[22:58] to the book of First Samuel chapter 18
[23:01] Samuel
[23:04] um
[23:08] to 15 and then we'll be after that we'll
[23:11] be going to proverbs 4 23.
[23:18] and then in the book of Acts Chapter 13
[23:21] Verse 22.
[23:26] first Samuel chapter 18 verse 14 through
[23:29] 15 says like this
[23:33] is
[23:34] and David behaved himself wisely in all
[23:38] of his ways and the Lord was with him
[23:46] foreign
[23:48] saw that he behaved himself very wisely
[23:52] he was afraid of him
[23:58] now in Proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 yeah
[24:06] it says keep thy heart with all
[24:08] diligence for out of it are the issues
[24:11] of life
[24:17] amen and then one last scripture in the
[24:20] book of Acts chapter 13
[24:27] says like this
[24:30] and when he had removed him he raised
[24:33] him he raised up unto them David to be
[24:35] their King to whom he also gave their
[24:38] testimony and said I have found David
[24:40] the son of Jesse
[24:47] they can
[25:22] Lord to be here tonight
[25:26] Lord an opportunity that not many of us
[25:29] not many people had an opportunity
[25:32] Lord to worship your name and give you
[25:34] glory
[25:36] Gloria Lord and and may not be me Lord
[25:40] Lord but maybe you speaking to me Lord
[25:45] put me aside
[25:48] so that your people can understand what
[25:51] I'm trying to say
[25:55] we also asked for our pastor Lord and
[25:57] brother John
[25:59] we put all this in your hands
[26:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:10] um
[26:11] did did you realize that David
[26:16] that aside from Jesus
[26:20] that more scripture is written about
[26:22] David
[26:24] than any other biblical character
[26:28] there's 66 66 chapters about him
[26:34] 56 a reference in the New Testament uh
[26:37] sequence
[26:40] but he also wrote 73 of the 150 Psalms
[26:48] so David was a musician
[26:51] he was a leader he was a warrior
[26:56] and he was a
[26:58] poeta you know David has some deep laws
[27:02] in his life
[27:03] but he also had some highs in his life
[27:07] and I think many of us can relate to
[27:10] that
[27:20] has brought us up
[27:25] David survived I believe that David
[27:27] survived
[27:30] all the things that he went through
[27:31] because of his heart
[27:38] now our title for this evening is
[27:42] a man after mine own heart yes
[27:47] so God wants people that are according
[27:49] to his heart
[27:52] not to the heart of somebody else
[27:55] but to the heart of God
[27:57] and as we read it says someone that
[28:01] which shall fulfill all of my will
[28:06] you know where is your heart tonight
[28:09] is it is it at work are you thinking
[28:13] about school
[28:15] why are you thinking about him
[28:18] or are you are you trusting in God
[28:20] tonight
[28:21] that whatever you're going through he's
[28:24] going to take you out
[28:25] foreign
[28:59] David knew that no matter what came to
[29:01] him
[29:04] he has something sure
[29:07] he wanted what God wants
[29:13] but he wanted what God wants
[29:19] there's five things that I was able to
[29:22] get from from David I think
[29:27] was his willingness to acknowledge his
[29:30] mistakes
[29:34] do we acknowledge our mistakes sometimes
[29:38] you know because sometimes
[29:41] you know and we do things we're not
[29:43] supposed to yeah but we don't
[29:45] acknowledge them
[29:47] and we don't ask God for forgiveness and
[29:50] we don't repent I say this for myself I
[29:54] don't know about you but I say this for
[29:55] myself
[29:59] number two
[30:01] the humility to recognize that he was
[30:04] weakness
[30:06] all right
[30:08] Saul thought that he could do it all
[30:11] the people of Israel wanted the king
[30:15] brothers that Israel wants to be like
[30:18] the rest of the Nations
[30:23] they wanted a king
[30:25] but he says that that's where they
[30:27] messed up
[30:29] because to start off they already had a
[30:31] king
[30:32] and that was God yes God was their King
[30:37] but they wanted to be like
[30:42] the why do we want to be like the rest
[30:50] number three the courage to step up in
[30:52] challenging situations
[30:57] [Music]
[30:58] strong passion
[31:00] Fuerte and love for godos
[31:06] do you love God tonight brothers and
[31:08] sisters
[31:16] the strength to change
[31:20] the strength should be different
[31:22] different than the others you know
[31:26] because David was a man into God's Own
[31:28] Hearts
[31:30] you know and David every time that he
[31:32] did something
[31:34] something that wasn't right
[31:36] he would ask God for forgiveness
[31:39] he will repentia
[31:43] because he wanted to be different he
[31:44] didn't want to be like the rest
[31:49] I believe that David's greatest assets
[32:01] there's going on there's a lot of stuff
[32:03] in the world today
[32:05] that try to steal our heart okay
[32:09] try to take us away from the things of
[32:11] God
[32:12] you know and David faced a lot of those
[32:15] challenges
[32:17] where he was faced with situations that
[32:20] you know he could have easily stepped
[32:21] aside or moved away from God
[32:26] but he still wanted what God wants
[32:30] and that's what we should have we should
[32:32] we should desires to have what God what
[32:35] God wants for us
[32:41] but then there's a different side
[32:44] that that the Bible describes that the
[32:46] hearts can also be deceitful
[32:51] therefore with must also pay attention
[32:54] to our hearts
[32:56] attention
[32:58] because I believe that God is constantly
[33:00] checking our hearts
[33:06] I know that many of us sometimes we're
[33:08] in situations
[33:11] you know where we're at and then all of
[33:14] a sudden we're like oh God I messed up
[33:19] you know but it's how I respond to my
[33:22] problems
[33:24] now I respond to my brothers or sisters
[33:32] When God Says
[33:37] to my Palms when my flesh says what what
[33:40] I want to do is
[33:51] it says like this now what a beautiful
[33:53] picture this gives us they say okay
[33:57] how God must be so broken heart because
[34:00] of our conducted
[34:05] after he has received us as Sons and
[34:07] Daughters
[34:10] the way we act and Carry On
[34:13] and grudges we hold us
[34:18] and first is and the little things that
[34:20] doesn't that should not be and yet
[34:22] calling ourselves Sons and Daughters of
[34:24] God
[34:27] we must be Gallant men
[34:31] we must be Gallant woman
[34:34] we must hold ourselves up
[34:39] [Music]
[34:54] man he was and God said thou art a man
[34:58] unto my own Hearts
[35:04] you know I I believe David really set
[35:06] the example in his time
[35:10] because he stood out from the rest
[35:12] it wasn't like the rest
[35:20] the Bible the Bible tells us that Saul
[35:23] was afraid of David
[35:27] you know it is one thing to have a wise
[35:30] heart
[35:32] and it's another thing to behave wisely
[35:39] as I read in proverbs 4 23 keep thy
[35:42] heart with all diligence
[35:48] for out of it are the issues of life
[35:54] I like the way it says it in English
[35:55] because out of it are the issues of
[35:57] problems
[36:00] are the problem is life
[36:04] how many can say men tonight
[36:13] we need we need people like David this
[36:16] is
[36:17] people that are willing to stand up for
[36:19] God
[36:21] people that are willing to set
[36:22] themselves on the front line
[36:27] to die for others
[36:35] in the message the great warrior David
[36:38] Guerrero David
[36:40] it says he was a Believer
[36:43] he was elected
[36:46] he was called he was anointed and he was
[36:50] placed
[36:52] Hallelujah no matter where you where
[36:54] you're just
[36:56] important
[36:58] you say well brother I wasn't called to
[37:00] be a preacher
[37:04] you might be called to be a housewife
[37:08] but you got your position in Christ
[37:10] Jesus by the Holy Ghost
[37:13] and it says amen your Justice mustache
[37:17] David as the rest of them was
[37:22] how many David's here tonight
[37:33] many of the times muchas versus
[37:37] you know I I think we we we put God
[37:39] aside
[37:41] we put God in a little corner
[37:44] and we say God we I don't need you
[37:47] you know God I don't I don't need you in
[37:50] my problems
[37:52] but God is saying let me be that hell
[37:55] for your problems
[37:57] for the things that you were going
[37:59] through
[38:01] I want to be there with you but
[38:04] sometimes we're just so so so selfish
[38:11] we don't let him control us
[38:13] we don't see guidance from God
[38:16] and like I said this is speaking for
[38:18] myself
[38:21] sometimes we just put God in a little
[38:23] corner
[38:25] but you know
[38:28] brother Brown says that Jesus is just an
[38:31] arms length away
[38:34] so Jesus is right there with you
[38:37] then how do we seem to push God aside
[38:47] I don't know about you but this is for
[38:48] me you know
[38:51] because I I personally I there's there's
[38:54] there's times where I I put God aside
[39:00] with the way I act
[39:03] with the way I behave
[39:06] you know and it makes me think so
[39:09] selfish of myself
[39:16] that somebody One Day
[39:18] in India died on the cross for you and I
[39:23] foreign
[39:52] that's what God that's what God wants
[39:54] Kitty people that seek Him people that
[39:57] want his guidance
[40:00] Isa
[40:04] I'll be finishing up if Mr Gustavo can
[40:07] get ready Gustavo
[40:25] youth brother sister
[40:29] where is your heart tonight
[40:33] really in the depth of your heart
[40:37] examine yourself
[40:41] you know because Jesus is always
[40:43] knocking on your door
[40:46] on the door of your heart
[40:50] you know he's just there knocking and
[40:51] knocking and knocking
[40:55] and sometimes and sometimes we just peek
[40:57] through that door yeah
[41:03] and we talk and we tell Jesus Jesus
[41:05] you're not welcome
[41:15] but you know what Tenaya I want to dine
[41:18] with him
[41:23] I want to eat supper with him
[41:28] I want him to know that I am with him
[41:31] and then he is with me
[41:33] no matter what I go through
[41:36] God is with me
[41:47] you know just just like David as the
[41:49] Bible said
[41:51] there came a point where
[41:55] noticed that he could not do anything
[42:11] there's not a sickness
[42:17] there's not a child
[42:19] there's nothing that will stand against
[42:21] you
[42:23] but we must know where we're standing
[42:29] [Music]
[42:36] thank you
[42:37] [Applause]
[42:41] India God bless you
[42:44] is
[42:45] the first thing I'd like to say is
[42:49] that I love you
[42:52] [Music]
[42:54] truly you see a young man
[43:01] but as young as I am in age
[43:05] God has allowed me to go through certain
[43:08] things
[43:09] he's taught me one thing
[43:13] just simply telling somebody I love you
[43:17] with all your heart
[43:19] it makes the difference many times
[43:24] it's a privilege to be a part of a
[43:27] beautiful church
[43:28] people that have showed me so much love
[43:33] and giving me love as as though I was
[43:35] their their son since
[43:40] I truly don't deserve all the love that
[43:42] many of you have given me
[43:44] it's a privilege to be a part of this
[43:47] church amen a man after his own heart um
[43:57] foreign
[44:57] we had something that many people
[45:01] something many people try to fake
[45:08] but there's something that you can never
[45:09] fake
[45:11] and that's the love of God
[45:14] the devil cannot fake the love of God
[45:17] he can try
[45:19] but at the end of the day what he offers
[45:23] is always something temporary
[45:28] something that just lasts you maybe five
[45:31] or ten minutes
[45:32] maybe a day maybe a week but my God
[45:36] offers a type of love that takes me back
[45:39] to him give me give us back to my home
[45:42] back to where I belong
[45:44] and only his love can do that
[45:47] inside of me then through the meat in
[45:49] this dark cruel world
[45:52] a man after my own heart
[45:56] that was David
[45:58] and tonight that's what I want to point
[46:01] you and my brother Timothy wants to
[46:03] point you is
[46:06] the simple fact is
[46:15] that's what people have always seeked is
[46:19] something real is they want something
[46:22] that works okay
[46:40] the definition of influence
[46:44] the capacity to have an effect on the
[46:48] character
[46:51] development
[46:53] or behavior of someone or something
[46:57] or the effect itself
[47:03] it's all right if I preach about what
[47:05] we're living today
[47:10] that's why our beloved God gave us
[47:13] he gave us a message
[47:15] he gave us word of love so that we can
[47:19] go through this dark and evil hey
[47:25] and that's why like I said there's
[47:27] people called influencers nowadays
[47:32] um
[47:33] in India that I want to tell you
[47:36] something momentarily
[47:40] and then they say oh if you buy this it
[47:43] is
[47:53] and then they have videos of people
[47:55] saying videos
[48:05] oh my life has changed
[48:08] I've never been the same again
[48:14] but better even still with those videos
[48:21] there's still a doubt
[48:24] there's a doubt I will not do that
[48:27] there's still a doubt yeah
[48:30] because you yourself still haven't
[48:31] tested it
[48:33] hasn't it happened to you
[48:36] Holiness out of the 35 to an hour that
[48:39] you're on your phone
[48:42] that in that 30 to an hour that you're
[48:45] on your phone
[48:49] you see a video or something that pops
[48:52] up
[48:55] trying to sell you something
[48:58] and you think for a second is
[49:04] but I want to talk to you about someone
[49:08] of a character that never doubted
[49:12] and what he really had
[49:15] because it was the love
[49:21] that made him take the decisions that he
[49:24] made
[49:27] take the battles that no one else wanted
[49:29] to take
[49:32] the challenge to say
[49:36] how dare this uncircumcised Philistines
[49:42] defile the army of the Lord
[49:46] imagine yourself what's your size
[49:51] imagine you saw someone twice your size
[49:55] insulting your culture
[49:58] insulting your family
[50:06] not even Having the courage to say
[50:08] something back
[50:11] has that ever happened to someone
[50:15] but in a spiritual sense spiritual
[50:20] my question tonight and many times can I
[50:22] have this question is
[50:25] do I have enough of God inside of me
[50:30] and if I if I do worry his fruits he
[50:32] says
[50:34] because David bear fruits
[50:37] [Music]
[50:45] of challenging moments
[50:49] he poured out what he had inside of him
[50:52] because he knew what he had inside of
[50:55] him was real
[50:57] he didn't doubt it for one second
[51:01] but many times like I said
[51:05] right now there are influencers
[51:09] and in this time maybe there was
[51:11] influences as well
[51:13] when he came into the army of Israel
[51:18] those people influencing fear upon Him
[51:26] anger Maybe
[51:30] trying to make them like the rest
[51:33] but tonight again
[51:38] I know I'm not I'm not someone
[51:41] per se of a name
[51:45] but I'm not trying to be there
[51:49] but I'm going to try to point you to
[51:51] someone
[51:54] else that's my Lord Jesus Christ
[51:59] through my Prophet
[52:02] I'm going to show you what my Prophet
[52:04] says
[52:09] he says in the message to reject the
[52:11] king
[52:13] but it has it has never been
[52:16] in any age God's intention for his
[52:19] people to act like the people of this
[52:21] world
[52:23] or to be governed or control like the
[52:26] people of this world
[52:29] God's people always have been peculiar
[52:32] people
[52:34] and the love of God always makes you
[52:37] duplicate your things
[52:44] hold your tongue when you have maybe the
[52:48] right way to say things to them
[52:53] Love Takes control of you
[52:57] the love of God can only do that
[53:01] different people he says
[53:09] I'm gonna jump ahead it says their
[53:12] appetite for things Jesus
[53:14] and all that and all that their makeups
[53:17] is
[53:19] has been always contrary to the things
[53:22] that the people of this world desire
[53:24] Simplex
[53:28] what's your appetite
[53:32] when
[54:32] and
[54:34] I have trouble cuando tengo problemas
[54:36] why do I always look to my phone
[54:40] oh I go deep into my studies
[54:45] or go deep into my work
[54:48] try to clog up my mind
[54:51] [Music]
[54:53] try to clog up my time and try not to
[54:57] worry about that problem
[55:00] we're trying to find another source
[55:03] that will satisfied
[55:07] my
[55:08] momento and I take away the the problem
[55:13] [Music]
[55:18] a prophet talks about three types of
[55:19] Believers
[55:21] and many times
[55:24] I've aspects of which believer am I
[55:26] pregnant
[55:29] I want you to know
[55:32] what type of believer you are uh
[55:38] yes
[55:40] you'll be in here right now
[55:43] shows yourself and the world
[55:46] um
[55:48] they're not that common Christian
[55:50] Believers
[55:54] it's just going to church for routine
[55:58] there's something inside of you that's
[56:00] tickling away I'll go the introduce
[56:02] Texas
[56:03] even though you may dip your hat okay
[56:08] there's something still inside you're
[56:10] saying
[56:12] that ain't right
[56:14] and that's the love to your God yes
[56:19] the love that God placed in you
[56:22] before the foundation of the world
[56:25] he knew he were gonna need that
[56:28] because he knew what type of heart you
[56:31] were gonna have
[56:32] and he knew that it was a type of hearts
[56:37] that was gonna please him
[56:40] put a part of himself inside
[56:44] and the devil has always wanted to take
[56:47] that away from us
[56:49] take that
[56:51] and make it something normal
[56:56] but like David
[56:58] the love that he had for his God
[57:01] made him stand out
[57:03] the love that we have for our God
[57:10] through this world makes us look god
[57:17] um
[57:22] we were called to be oddballs in this
[57:25] dark and cruel age
[57:29] but I have a message
[57:33] I am one of them
[57:41] that has that part of God
[57:44] that doesn't let him stay still
[57:47] that even within my lowest moment yeah
[57:51] my darkest moments
[57:54] there's still something inside of me
[57:57] come back to me I'm still here
[58:02] the grace is still here
[58:07] I don't love you less
[58:10] I don't love you less when you make a
[58:12] message
[58:23] you didn't choose me to be a Christian
[58:25] when I was perfect
[58:27] he chose me when I was in my lowest
[58:32] he chose me when I was when the world
[58:34] wouldn't give it a scent for me
[58:37] this is what God chose you and me
[58:41] Nosotros
[58:43] s
[58:47] the message to reject the king in the
[58:50] men's
[58:52] it says he said there's some people
[58:57] they like to live through six days any
[59:00] way they want to it
[59:04] and go to church on Sunday morning
[59:08] and find an intellectual college
[59:10] graduate with a pleasant degree
[59:16] certificate that can speak a little
[59:19] sermon
[59:20] thanks be to God
[59:23] we're not that type of church
[59:26] we don't need a big old preaching we
[59:29] don't need much shouting
[59:32] that's what I want to believe
[59:37] that we have been brought a simple
[59:39] message
[59:48] that this world may say yes
[59:52] it can't be that simple
[59:57] I've said that before
[1:00:00] it can't be that simple
[1:00:03] but it is
[1:00:10] your three struggle with that
[1:00:13] because many times we feel like if we do
[1:00:16] something
[1:00:17] equally bad foreign
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:01:21] [Music]
[1:01:37] true of Hearts is
[1:01:44] something that you want more
[1:01:48] I can't give it to you
[1:01:51] but we know who cares
[1:01:56] we've always known this
[1:01:59] the Simplicity of God
[1:02:02] the Simplicity of his forgiveness
[1:02:14] to make you doubt that foreign
[1:02:45] thus saith the Lord is
[1:02:48] for pure hearts it's your life sorry is
[1:02:52] an undefiled character who characters in
[1:02:55] Manchester for a different life A
[1:02:57] peculiar people
[1:02:59] a holy nation
[1:03:04] they'd rather consider with the world
[1:03:07] sorry coincide with the world
[1:03:10] and act like the world
[1:03:13] and go to some church that says
[1:03:17] that's all right just go just just act
[1:03:21] like the way you go on yes
[1:03:25] I know
[1:03:30] the devil is tried it many times
[1:03:40] but one thing that my pastor has shown
[1:03:42] me
[1:03:44] Pastor it makes me know that this God of
[1:03:47] ours is real may I say uh
[1:03:52] is there such a simple love
[1:03:55] an unconditional love
[1:04:00] a love that will make you
[1:04:03] not only recognize that you're wrong
[1:04:07] but I have the trust
[1:04:10] to want to come back the poder regressar
[1:04:15] if you please stand up she is
[1:04:25] again
[1:04:28] I'm not trying to excite no one no kiddo
[1:04:32] uh
[1:04:35] I'm not preaching anything
[1:04:38] we all know this
[1:04:40] we can call it ABC
[1:04:44] but why do we still struggle
[1:04:48] to
[1:04:50] Simply know
[1:04:54] forgiveness is right there for me
[1:04:59] love is an armed strength away
[1:05:06] but tonight
[1:05:09] I want you to know
[1:05:11] what type of heart you have
[1:05:15] um
[1:05:16] even though the devil has tried
[1:05:19] to smudge
[1:05:23] tried to take it away
[1:05:26] and try to mix it up with the whole
[1:05:28] world
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:33] our Gods love uh has provided such a
[1:05:37] protection
[1:05:40] a fortress
[1:05:46] like when he said
[1:05:48] God says
[1:05:52] about job
[1:05:54] you can touch his body
[1:05:57] always belongs
[1:06:01] but just don't touch his heart
[1:06:05] that's the type of God we have
[1:06:09] he cares for us so much
[1:06:11] he loves us so much
[1:06:14] and it is so simple it overpasses us
[1:06:17] many of the times is
[1:06:20] [Music]
[1:06:26] that that God is for us is
[1:06:32] he knew what we were going to go through
[1:06:34] in this dark time
[1:06:36] and that's why the Bible says for God so
[1:06:39] loved the world foreign
[1:06:57] if there's any doubts
[1:07:01] you want to give your heart back to him
[1:07:05] and ask him to fill him up with that
[1:07:07] type of love
[1:07:08] [Music]
[1:07:10] that type of love that
[1:07:13] makes you trusted is
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:21] that type of Love Is
[1:07:25] Egoista
