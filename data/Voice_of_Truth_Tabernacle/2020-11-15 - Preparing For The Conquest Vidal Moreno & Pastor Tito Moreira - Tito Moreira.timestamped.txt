[18:02] house of
[18:05] God Amen God is good Brothers
[18:08] Amen Let Us open our Bibles this
[18:13] morning to the Book of Joshua chapter
[18:18] 5 um we'll be starting on verse
[18:23] 13
[18:27] um and it reads in this
[18:33] manner and it came to pass when Joshua
[18:36] was by Jericho that he lifted up his
[18:38] eyes and looked and behold there stood a
[18:41] man over against him with his sword
[18:44] drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto
[18:47] him and said unto him art thou for us or
[18:50] for our
[18:57] adversaries
[19:08] and he said nay but as captain of the
[19:10] host of the Lord am I now come and
[19:13] Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and
[19:15] did worship and said unto him what sayth
[19:17] my Lord unto his
[19:27] servant
[19:35] and the captain of the Lord's host said
[19:36] unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy
[19:39] foot for the place whereon thou standest
[19:41] is Holy and Joshua did
[19:52] so let us bow our heads to
[19:56] pray Heavenly Father
[19:58] father we're so grateful this morning
[20:03] Lord because you are so good and so kind
[20:05] to us
[20:08] Lord we ask that you just visit us this
[20:11] morning
[20:13] Father you just anoint the lips that
[20:15] will be speaking
[20:18] Lord and those that will be hearing as
[20:20] well
[20:22] father and we just be prepared to
[20:24] receive of your of your goodness and of
[20:26] your blessings Lord
[20:31] and at the end of the service may your
[20:32] name be glorified
[20:35] father we ask this all in the name of
[20:37] our Lord Jesus
[20:39] Christ amen am you may be
[20:42] seated for a title this
[20:45] morning uh we I titled it uh we we
[20:48] titled it preparing for the
[20:52] conquest for the
[20:57] conest and and uh you know as just for a
[21:01] thought um we we just we just uh it was
[21:04] just
[21:07] submission um and and you know uh I just
[21:10] hope that you know that we just come
[21:13] prepared this
[21:15] morning you know there's a lot of times
[21:18] you know in in our
[21:21] lives and we we we've all come to
[21:24] church you know and you know the Bible
[21:26] says we're more than conqu
[21:31] through Christ
[21:33] Jesus you know I believe that with all
[21:35] of my
[21:38] heart but before we can conquer there
[21:40] has to be a
[21:44] preparation you know in all of Joshua
[21:46] chapter
[21:48] 5 was about
[21:51] preparation he was preparing the
[21:54] people you know all of it if you see
[21:58] they they had to get they circumcised
[22:02] themselves and you know and then they
[22:04] had the Feast of the
[22:07] Passover you know and and they were it
[22:09] was just
[22:11] preparation you know because God loves
[22:13] when you
[22:15] prepare you know and when you are
[22:17] prepared for for to
[22:21] conquer know that's when God begins to
[22:23] do
[22:25] things but it all has to do with the
[22:27] preparation
[22:30] my question this morning to
[22:32] you how did we prepare for this morning
[22:36] service oh you know how did we prepare
[22:38] last
[22:40] night because brother brandom
[22:43] says that we should be be preparing the
[22:46] night before
[22:49] service what did you stay up late
[22:53] doing you see that's between you and
[22:56] God because when you
[22:59] prepare you better believe that God is
[23:02] going to help you
[23:04] conquer you and that's where many of our
[23:07] failures
[23:09] come you know we fail to win the
[23:14] battle because we fail to
[23:18] prepare you see God does not want you to
[23:21] fail I don't have a God that has lost a
[23:26] battle lose
[23:29] battles lost a
[23:31] battle and his children don't have to
[23:34] lose battles
[23:36] either amen
[23:41] amen and as we
[23:45] continue uh we see that that Joshua
[23:48] being a
[23:50] leader you know he had a lot on his
[23:54] plate you know he had to lead many of
[23:58] people in his
[24:01] time it wasn't just you know 10 or
[24:05] 20 100
[24:08] 200 you know but it was millions of
[24:11] people that were following this
[24:14] man and I believe that Joshua was a very
[24:17] special
[24:19] man and he was a very prepared man for
[24:22] the
[24:23] job God had been preparing him since the
[24:26] beginning
[24:28] but you know as Leaders many
[24:32] times you know you have to make
[24:35] decisions that that don't just affect
[24:39] you but they affect the people that you
[24:42] are
[24:44] leading you know so and leading that
[24:47] many
[24:50] people being being that type of
[24:53] leader I believe that it becomes a very
[24:56] lonely place
[25:00] because you know you just can't you just
[25:01] can't go by what the people are telling
[25:06] you you know a leader has a lot of
[25:09] people around
[25:11] him you know and and they're they're
[25:13] trying to you know they're they
[25:15] sometimes they don't they don't mean to
[25:17] do
[25:19] wrong you know they they're just like
[25:21] maybe you should do
[25:25] this or maybe you should do that
[25:29] you know but a lot of times what what
[25:30] they're what they're
[25:33] saying is they're being led by their
[25:37] feelings you know and I believe that you
[25:39] know it's no different
[25:42] today you know we sometimes we just
[25:45] we're just led by our
[25:48] feelings you know and Joshua had to be
[25:50] very careful those
[25:53] things you know because although the
[25:55] people were preparing
[25:59] you see Joshua was a little uneasy about
[26:05] things he he was just he was just a
[26:07] little bit
[26:12] uncomfortable you know about the
[26:15] situation cuz I'm sure the people there
[26:17] was some of some of the people that were
[26:19] around
[26:20] him they were like Joshua right now is
[26:23] the best
[26:25] time we were circumcised now
[26:30] the Feast of the
[26:32] Passover let's do it right
[26:34] now let's just go and take
[26:37] over you heard the Lord he said it was
[26:42] ours Jero was ours to
[26:45] take you see but Joshua kind had to step
[26:49] back and analyze the
[26:52] situation because his
[26:55] decision he decided to go by what the
[26:58] people
[26:58] [Applause]
[27:00] said there were many lives at
[27:03] stake it wasn't just his
[27:07] own but it was millions of
[27:11] people so he was
[27:13] waiting was seeking
[27:16] counsel from
[27:18] God and we find in the
[27:22] Scripture it says that Joshua is by
[27:26] Jero other words you know he saw the
[27:29] Great Walls from from a
[27:32] distance and he just maybe just sit
[27:34] there meditating on
[27:37] God seeking his
[27:40] counsel it's like Lord you know there's
[27:42] something not right about the
[27:46] situation I need you to guide
[27:49] me I need you to steer me and and let me
[27:51] know when I should
[27:54] go so he begins to reflect
[27:58] he begins to remember the first
[28:01] battle and how it went
[28:04] down and you know when we when we talk
[28:06] about the first
[28:09] battle he starts thinking about his
[28:13] leader and that was
[28:15] Moses because Joshua was under Moses for
[28:19] a long
[28:20] time he was learning from
[28:23] Moses and you know Moses told
[28:26] Joshua in Exodus chapter
[28:29] 17 he pick you pick you some men pick
[28:33] some
[28:34] men you know and you're going to go
[28:37] fight and you know he had to fight the
[28:41] amalekites that was the very first
[28:43] battle that he
[28:45] fought and you know Joshua you know he
[28:48] was a servant of
[28:50] God he was a servant before he was a
[28:53] leader he was a
[28:55] servant amen amen and we
[28:59] see that Joshua begins to fight that
[29:04] battle and and you know and and and he's
[29:06] just fighting
[29:08] away and and you know that battle that
[29:11] he
[29:13] fought you know Joshua did not win it by
[29:16] his own
[29:18] strength you see but he looks up to the
[29:20] side of the
[29:23] mountain he sees Moses up
[29:26] there he sees Aaron and er up
[29:31] there and
[29:33] and and then they were up
[29:36] there and they had their hands lifted
[29:40] up you see and when they had their hands
[29:44] lifted Israel began to win the
[29:48] battle you see and at that
[29:51] moment you see the the the Revelation
[29:54] came down to
[29:56] Joshua that the
[29:58] battle that Jericho would not be
[30:02] won if he went in his own
[30:06] strength you see there's a lot of time
[30:08] in our
[30:10] lives we fight many
[30:13] battles you see we're just like you know
[30:15] we get
[30:17] excited and there's nothing wrong with
[30:19] being
[30:21] excited but we just we just let the
[30:23] excitement
[30:26] overshadow
[30:28] you know over over God's
[30:31] will we get all pumped
[30:37] up and we're just ready to
[30:40] go do
[30:42] this take
[30:44] over I'm GNA tell you
[30:46] something you should slow down
[30:50] cowboy you know just slow
[30:53] down you ain't going to do
[30:56] anything
[30:57] because when you think you're going to
[30:59] do something on your
[31:02] own you're going to see how you're going
[31:04] to
[31:06] fail and that's what Joshua was
[31:09] doing he was waiting on
[31:12] God he was not depending on his
[31:15] [Music]
[31:16] strength on what he could
[31:18] do but he was
[31:21] waiting and you know he just like I have
[31:23] to do something
[31:25] else he had to
[31:28] submit he had to submit to
[31:32] God
[31:33] before he could take
[31:36] Jericho if we would just do that this
[31:40] morning we wouldn't we wouldn't be so
[31:43] defeated many
[31:46] times we wouldn't come to
[31:49] church and leave disappointed the way we
[31:51] do
[31:55] sometimes a lot of times we leave Church
[31:59] disappointed and you know the reason
[32:02] is is because you never
[32:05] prepared the minister can prepare as
[32:08] much as he wants
[32:10] to he cannot prepare for
[32:14] you he can't he he can't do everything
[32:17] for
[32:18] you he's going to do his
[32:20] part but you have to do
[32:23] yours if you want to leave with a
[32:25] blessing this morning
[32:29] prepare from the
[32:32] night I did not come I don't come to
[32:37] church to to leave
[32:41] disappointed I come so that God can give
[32:44] me a
[32:46] blessing I live here
[32:49] rejoicing here
[32:51] excited but we have to make
[32:54] sure that we are prepared
[32:57] we made room for
[33:00] God that we pushed all the things that
[33:03] are that we don't need
[33:05] out so that he can give us of what he
[33:09] has he victories for
[33:15] us this
[33:18] morning what do you
[33:20] need he's got
[33:22] it amen
[33:24] amen moving forward
[33:28] you know and and Moses you know or I
[33:30] mean
[33:31] Joshua you know as he
[33:36] reflects you know he just he just begins
[33:38] to
[33:39] think you know on on the goodness of
[33:43] God you know because because when you
[33:45] have to make great
[33:48] decisions you know you just you just
[33:51] begin to reflect on God's
[33:54] goodness you know those walls of Jer
[33:57] weren't a wall like this one right
[34:00] here those walls were
[34:03] massive you could see them from from
[34:06] miles away I believe they were so
[34:10] big and you know Joshua was
[34:13] human he's like God have you been so
[34:18] good have you kept your
[34:21] word us to this
[34:24] point and I believe you
[34:28] but I I need you to help
[34:30] me I need of your
[34:33] counsel you know because he he didn't
[34:35] want to
[34:37] lose we don't want to lose a
[34:41] battle I do not like to
[34:45] lose I'm not a
[34:48] loser you know and if somebody told you
[34:50] you're loser they're
[34:53] lying
[34:55] losers we're
[34:58] winners you see and that's why we're
[35:00] here because we want to be on the
[35:02] winning
[35:04] team winner I don't care what anybody
[35:08] tells
[35:08] me they tell you you're a loser out
[35:12] there God told me I'm a
[35:15] winner I'm to
[35:18] lose here to
[35:21] win to win the
[35:24] heavens I'm here to win a crown
[35:27] whatever God has for me I want to win
[35:31] it that you have to have a
[35:35] preparation you don't want to leave
[35:38] disappointed sir and
[35:42] Joshua when when he just finish finishes
[35:46] meditating all of a
[35:48] sudden someone appears before
[35:52] him and Joshua pulls out his
[35:55] sword who are you
[35:58] with you know what team are you
[36:01] on you know and he's like I'm the
[36:03] captain of the
[36:07] host that's who he
[36:10] was and that's who he still
[36:13] is he's not
[36:15] changed you know and what amazes
[36:18] me is that he he appeared to
[36:21] Moses in a burning
[36:24] bush you see but he no longer was
[36:28] burning that's not who he was
[36:31] anymore he was not the angel that rled
[36:35] Jacob
[36:38] anymore but he was a
[36:40] man he was the
[36:43] captain that was suited
[36:48] up he was suited up for
[36:52] battle not only
[36:54] that but he had his sword Dr
[36:59] he was ready to
[37:01] go and when Joshua saw
[37:05] him and he if he knew who he
[37:08] was he bowed before
[37:11] him he bowed before
[37:15] him that's right he bowed before
[37:18] him he submitted to
[37:21] God you see and this
[37:24] God is the one that Joshua was waiting
[37:29] for you see Joshua being a great
[37:33] leader he was he did not feel fit to go
[37:36] by
[37:38] himself he didn't feel
[37:41] ready something was
[37:44] missing he's like I
[37:46] need I need something else and he just
[37:52] surrendered he fell on his
[37:55] face saw the captain he fell before his
[38:00] face because God was
[38:04] there and God was going to lead them
[38:07] into the
[38:09] battle I believe this
[38:11] morning we have a
[38:14] God that we have a god that is suited up
[38:18] for
[38:19] battle sword is
[38:23] drawn
[38:25] fight
[38:28] he's not a
[38:29] leader he's not a
[38:31] captain that's going to send you to
[38:33] battle
[38:36] first no he he's
[38:38] ready he is sued up to lead
[38:42] you if you want to go by yourself go
[38:47] ahead you you'll
[38:49] fail I've done it many times in my
[38:52] life I have failed when I Tred to do
[38:55] things my own way
[38:58] you know there's a lot of times where we
[39:01] just we just think that we can do it
[39:04] all and we come back very
[39:08] disappointed we come back very
[39:14] discouraged because we have
[39:17] not we've not allowed
[39:20] God to lead us into
[39:23] battle simp that we haven't let go
[39:28] of the things that we need to let go
[39:31] of you see and that's what it
[39:34] takes to win the
[39:37] battle men and women of
[39:41] God
[39:43] willing to let go of of of of who they
[39:46] think they
[39:49] are just lift up your
[39:52] hands just like Moses was up there
[39:57] he just had his hands lifted
[40:00] up he just didn't want anything to get
[40:03] in the
[40:06] way Joshua felt
[40:10] insufficient know we are insufficient in
[40:16] ourselves that's we are and if you don't
[40:19] think
[40:20] so then like I said you go on
[40:24] ahead you will be very dis disappointed
[40:26] in the
[40:33] outcome you see and and God does not
[40:35] want that he does not want us to
[40:39] fail you see he he wants
[40:42] us to submit everything we
[40:46] have all of our time all of our
[40:50] strength everything that we
[40:53] are say Lord I'm not sufficient

[41:19] battle fight for his
[41:22] people he wants to cut that Sin from
[41:25] your life

[43:12] said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off
[43:15] thy foot for the place whereon thou
[43:17] standest is Holy and Joshua did
[43:20] so if you
[43:22] knew you

[44:06] telling when God tells
[44:10] Joshua take Thy Thy shoe from thy
[44:16] foot for the place where on thou
[44:18] standest is when God tells him this God

[46:43] standing because I am with
[46:45] you because my presence has gone with
[46:48] you and will continue with
[46:54] you when they they speak of the
[46:56] scripture and
[47:00] Jericho people many times
[47:06] say God will fight your
[47:10] battle and up to certain point it is
[47:17] true many times we make it
[47:22] seem like if we have nothing to do
[47:26] like if God
[47:29] is trusting on God and he's goingon to
[47:32] fight the
[47:33] battle that's not the scene we're seeing
[47:38] here actually Joshua had much
[47:43] responsibility from verse since verse
[47:46] eight of chapter
[47:48] one God promised to be with
[47:54] Joshua had certain responsibility and
[47:59] obligations God told them in verse
[48:03] eight this is your responsibility
[48:08] Joshua
[48:11] never this this book of the law shall
[48:14] depart out of thy
[48:17] mouth but Thou shalt meditate there in
[48:20] day and
[48:21] night that thou
[48:23] mayest observe and do
[48:28] did
[48:30] josu did Joshua have something to Joshua
[48:34] have
[48:35] something God was not going to
[48:38] do
[48:40] he josua had a
[48:48] [Applause]
[48:50] responsibility that thou mayest observe
[48:52] to do according to all that is
[48:54] written now tell me if Joshua didn't
[48:56] have anything to
[49:00] do when God just gave gave him gave him
[49:02] a great
[49:05] responsibility to keep and do
[49:11] everything now let me tell you we
[49:14] have what the word says Joshua needs to
[49:17] do everything yes or yes
[49:24] brother may serve to do according to all
[49:27] that
[49:30] is for then thou shal make thy way
[49:34] prosperous and then Thou shalt have good
[49:38] success I want you to understand that
[49:40] Jericho's
[49:42] battle the Battle of
[49:46] Jericho they would not fight in on
[49:50] the with
[49:52] swords and Spear and arrow
[49:59] they would not fight physically
[50:02] on but they had to battle
[50:05] with for it would be an
[50:09] internal sometimes that's the greatest
[50:12] battle it's the internal
[50:16] battle for us to win what's happening
[50:20] outside conquer what's outside
[50:24] of heart is to
[50:27] conquer because in
[50:31] rebellious we're
[50:34] disobedient this is a
[50:36] trial the Battle of
[50:38] Jer was a
[50:41] battle of
[50:45] obedience of
[50:48] obedience God would test put to test
[50:52] his God tells Joshua Joshua
[50:59] you will go seven around once every
[51:03] [Applause]
[51:04] day day the entire people will surround
[51:07] Jero and on the
[51:10] seventh you will go seven around and
[51:14] then Thou
[51:15] shalt now for any
[51:21] person any person who has a natural
[51:24] reason who has a sane
[51:27] mind any s person would say that's
[51:32] foolish come
[51:34] on of us our natural
[51:37] mind we'd say that's
[51:43] foolish how that
[51:50] City while we go seven times around
[51:53] Jero it was something
[51:58] crazy any any man would have said I'll
[52:01] take my
[52:02] sword I will go
[52:06] myself and at least toss a couple
[52:09] Stones I want to slay a couple of them
[52:13] but God
[52:15] says you will only go
[52:19] around was testing
[52:21] their because that was
[52:24] foolish
[52:26] Bible says 1 Corinthians
[52:28] 1:18 for the preaching of the
[52:32] Cross is to them that perish
[52:35] foolishness but unto which
[52:38] are it is
[52:40] the power of
[52:42] God for it is
[52:45] written I will destroy the
[52:49] wisdom of the wise and I will bring
[52:52] to where's the
[52:54] wise Des
[52:57] scbe the disp of this
[53:00] world have not God made foolish of the
[53:02] wisdom
[53:03] of for after that in the wisdom
[53:07] of the World by wisdom knew not
[53:11] God and pleased God by the
[53:15] foolish of preaching to save them that
[53:18] believe for the Jews
[53:21] require and the Greeks
[53:24] seek
[53:26] but we preach Christ
[53:29] crucified unto the
[53:31] Jews and unto
[53:33] theek
[53:35] but both Jews
[53:38] and the power of God and the wisdom of
[53:42] God because the foolish of
[53:45] God wiser than men the weakness
[53:49] of stronger than
[53:52] men that's the God we serve
[53:55] Our
[53:57] God foolish to
[54:00] us the greatest
[54:03] wisdom the wisdom of God is
[54:07] greater the knowledge of this
[54:11] world and the weakness of
[54:15] God and the weakness of God
[54:18] hallelujah and the weakness of
[54:21] God is stronger than
[54:24] man
[54:26] that is our
[54:28] God why do we keep
[54:32] losing why do we not
[54:35] Prosper what the reason we can't
[54:38] conqu for our lack of
[54:43] Disobedience the reason we cannot
[54:47] conquer because we cannot
[54:50] surrend we cannot
[54:52] obey what God has told us
[54:57] because for our mind it
[55:01] seems for our mind it seems we have a
[55:03] better
[55:05] way but God has always done foolish
[55:09] things with a ass
[55:15] Jawbone Samson slay a thousand
[55:18] Philistines that's
[55:21] foolish you cannot do
[55:24] that but it was God's
[55:27] power it was The
[55:29] Obedience yes or yes
[55:33] brother God decided through an as's
[55:38] Jawbone to kill a thousand
[55:42] Philistines God
[55:44] decided to
[55:46] choose a
[55:48] young named
[55:50] Mary and through
[55:53] her through her
[55:57] he told
[55:59] Mary the Holy Ghost shall overshadow
[56:03] you and what you
[56:05] will will be the
[56:07] Messiah she did
[56:12] not although it was
[56:14] foolish she simply said
[56:18] Lord according to
[56:23] your
[56:25] I will
[56:27] fulfill was her faith she believed she
[56:32] believed something that was
[56:39] foolish who would have
[56:42] thought through
[56:45] foolishness of a crucified
[56:47] Christ
[56:51] Messiah bring Salvation for Humanity
[56:56] of that's
[56:58] foolish for God
[57:06] toic see him with no attraction
[57:10] to
[57:21] among decided to con hell
[57:31] all
[57:40] temptation foolishness we don't
[57:44] obey because it's foolish to
[57:53] us going to make parenthesis
[57:59] here it's hurt us greatly that the Lord
[58:02] took our sister
[58:08] Florencia and it's unfair for me to
[58:11] speak of the pain we
[58:15] feel knowing that her
[58:18] children and they are in a greater pain
[58:21] than we
[58:23] are but but I believe it hurts all of us
[58:27] it's hurt me a
[58:33] lot but I don't
[58:37] believe that it was a
[58:41] coincidence that the Lord took
[58:46] her I believe many lives have been
[58:49] changed and will change for what
[58:53] happened Lord took her for being
[58:57] disobedient I believe it was our
[58:59] sister's she was not doing
[59:02] anything she was not doing
[59:06] anything she was
[59:08] doing to be in her place of
[59:12] doing she was doing what she had
[59:14] to didn't take her from it was God's
[59:19] will but many of the things that have
[59:22] happened putting this aside that been
[59:26] said many of the things that have
[59:29] happened
[59:29] to are for
[59:33] Disobedience are for
[59:35] Disobedience because we've told you what
[59:38] you must do how you must
[59:44] do and we're not ashamed to go out step
[59:47] out of the church and do everything
[59:49] opposite you think God is not seeing
[59:52] that God sees our
[59:56] disob God sees how we
[1:00:05] disrespect say brother ttis it makes no
[1:00:10] sense you're
[1:00:13] overthinking you're
[1:00:16] overthinking I hear what you
[1:00:21] say but the one that will judge me for
[1:00:23] that will be
[1:00:26] our job is to Simply

[1:00:32] us it might not make sense to
[1:00:36] us we might say what's that worth
