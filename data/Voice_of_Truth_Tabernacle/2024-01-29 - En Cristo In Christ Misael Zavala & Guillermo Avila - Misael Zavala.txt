[Music] the [Music] follow me with your Bible First Thessalonians 4 verse 16 we're thankful with the Lord and the pastor for the opportunity to be here we send them greetings to our brothers watching through the internet first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first if you can follow me to Luke 17 verse 26-30 as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that law went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed you can bow your head beloved Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for giving us life this day to come and hear your word Lord Lord a day like this Sunday because there's not an eighth day there's seven days Lord and on the if there was you entered in the resurrection and Lord you entered into heaven you resurrected on that day and we ask you to resurrect us with your word Lord give us life Lord Lord I ask you anoint my lips and anoint the ears of the hearers that this morning Lord you give us life with your word we thank you put this service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated for a title my brother and I have titled our sermon in in in Christ uh we're speaking on the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord is made of three parts or or or three phases the shout voice of Archangel and Trump of God we have studied the shout now and now we're moving on to the voice of Archangel that is the resurrection of the Dead in the Old Testament we always seen the shadows and shapes of what's happening in these last days the shout is a call to come out a message just like Abraham and Moses were called to leave from their Homeland Resurrection we can see it in Moses when the Archangel Michael fought over his body and we were taught that God resurrected him because in that Transfiguration of the Lord Jesus Christ the apostles would see it and the Rapture that is what's next to come we can see that in Enoch and Elijah having said this I'd like to read Leviticus 23 a type of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and type of the Resurrection that's following the one we're waiting for Leviticus 2310 and 11 this is speaking of the Feast of Israel Israel had many feasts but here we're gonna focus on one speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye become into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a sheath of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priests and he shall wave the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it here it's talking about the first resurrection is the first fruit is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ because he was the first to resurrect so that sheath that is waved represents the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ uh in the message it is rising of the sun preached 1965 paragraph 37 if there would be any holy ritual it should come forth on the Sabbath day which was the seventh day of the week which was Saturday but did you notice in this Memorial to wave it on the first day of the week the sheath which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripens you cut down his sheath and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for acceptance that you are accepted you have come with your sheath and he is to wave it before the Lord not on the Sabbath the seventh day but on the first day which we call Sunday of course that's a Roman word which they called it in the Sunday for the Sun God but how it's changed it's not s n anymore it's s o n d a y the Sunday that the corn of week God's first one come up from the dead it is to be waved over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of the seeds of those that slept waved upon the first day of the week on Sunday he raised up waved goodbye and ascended upon on high in the presence of the people notice it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead God's first corn of Wheat by God's quickening power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheath that's why they had to wave that sheep for it was the first one that came to maturity and it was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign it says it was a sign now this is what we're trusting in because we believe the Lord Jesus Christ resurrected and because he did and he resurrected the dead from that time and gave us the promise that he would resurrect in this time the ones that slept in this age now if you notice here that sheath was waved on the first day but the week only has seven days so Sabbath the Saturday is the last day for the Jews so that represents the seven Church ages seven ages with a promise of a resurrection after the seventh age Leviticus 23:15 we'll continue reading and ye shall count unto you from the tomorrow after the Sabbath from the day that ye brought the sheath of the wave offering seven sabbaths shall be complete even until the tomorrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number 50 days and you shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord what it's saying here after the day of rest that's the seventh day says seven weeks shall be fulfilled seven Church ages even until the tomorrow after the seventh Sabbath shall you number 50 days and you shall offer a new meat offering not notice the grain had been offered the first fruits that happened already but here is speaking of a new grain or new meat what is that new grain have you asked yourself if there's been a new grain because God the Lord Jesus Christ God poured himself in the Lord Jesus Christ completely and it was the first grain to reach maturity but there's another grain that will mature another words it's already matured we'll continue reading it is the rising of the sun paragra 41 as Christ was the first one toas from all the prophets and so forth all those Ted in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheath what was that sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was we that proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the [Music] people and the first time though will come forth from the bright age for Resurrection out of a dark denominationalism will be a message that was the shout the message is here that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there time the same thing that happened with our Lord Jesus Christ back there is happening now with who with a new mature grain because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now and as I say it it's to be waved again in the last day you can follow me to First Corinthians 15 verse 20 to 23 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for Since By Man Came Death by man also came the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ at his coming Pablo Paul is here narrating these three stages of the Lord's coming on verse 20 he says but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept Paul is saying here this has this is completed already this is done but 23 says but every man in his own order Christ the first fruit afterward they that are Christ at his coming it says at his coming that's the other Resurrection why because 20 already happened verse 20 already happened the resurrection had happened already so in verse 23 it's another Resurrection so we can understand a little Christ what does Christ mean the anointed the anointed the word says there also false anointed a known example is bamed by the he had word of God he prophesized but he had the wrong Doctrine that's what made him false so Christ means anointed we know that in these last days there was a anointed sheath by the Lord I continue reading in the message 965 paragraph 39 and today because he was the first Son of God to come to full maturity to be in God he was plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people oh what a glorious Lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had been typed and many times as we'll see later that he was typed but this was really the first fruits of them that slept he was waved over from Over the promised seed that had promised of life he was waved at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waved again we realize in the last day according to Luke 17:30 in the day in the sun day in the Sunday man will be revealed or waved again over the people brother Bram says it in verse 40 you can read this at home the message rising of the sun 1965 you'll understand it better brother Bram doesn't say here who it is but he puts it this way now who is this son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us and all of the teaching that we have and the confirmation of the word of God by by the the word of God by Signs by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke here as we just quoted from Luke the 17th chapter and the 13th verse and Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that the word again is waved over the people that the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us and is giving us life I'm run out of time and I won't have enough time to read the rest of my quotes in your home rising in the sun it explains it all so it's saying that in these These Times there will be another grain there is another grain that will wave God's word that grain reached his full maturity Jesus Christ in that grain P himself completely in this time I just want to leave you with this who was the one that gave the shout the shout says Jesus Christ gave it but Jesus Christ does not touch ground shout is the message of the hour but if Jesus Christ does not touch the Earth in this coming how will that shout happen through his Prophet Jesus Christ poured himself completely in a prophet that has the shout the grain waved for this age the grain that does not mature in this age the word of God says says for the same the same that with with a shout voice of Archangel so who will bring the voice of the same the word is telling you the same there won't be a difference there's not an eighth there's nobody else it says the same the same grain the same that matured but there is also a promise that is not only that sheath but the sheath is the first one to mature so if it's the first it means there are more that's referring to every one of you sitting here but for that we need for that we need come to Jesus Christ amen uh they can fix my time please we'll continue [Music] reading paragraph 60 1965 what does it do now listen so that you will know this Easter I want it to mean more to you than any Easter ever did I want you to see it I we know what it done for him but I want you to see it's not will it has done the same for you see God has done the same for you what does it do it quickens the Mortal body this Mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words brings to life my time so I'll leave you with this there is a resurrection we are waiting for the resurrection of the dead and that same preaching rising of the Sun the prophet says the resurrection has already begun in you when you receive the Holy Spirit the resurrection has sometimes we think and I sayen because we speak that the Rapture is happening but before the raptures the resurrection and although it says we will receive him in the you must die to yourself to be resurrected spiritually my brother can please come and God bless [Applause] you hallelujah we're happy in this morning Brethren He is wonderful not sure if he is for you but for me he's my absolute for me he's the [Music] proof he is everything I can desire and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen how many are waiting on him we titled our sermon more on brother M's behalf and it went more with what I have and we titled it in Christ don't finish with my thought because it's plenty I'd like to give it to you in the beginning so you understand where I'm head the scripture says that first Thessalonians 416 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of Archangel and the Trump of God shall descend from heaven in and the dead in in in Christ that's why my thought is in Christ specific the dead in Christ shall rise first here is a dma here is where we go anywhere here is where some believe here's where somebody something here's where the message where the message takes its own way message Believers believe in the return of the Prophet a 5% believe he is and here is where things get divided so this ain't milk this is me this is where your soul depends on what you believe you cannot let Another Sunday go by here here you cannot be settled us as head we cannot be resting and just you need to go to the word Jesus Christ is the word we need to go and match what we've been told and I don't want to get into detail because I'm not the pastor I'm not responsible for pastor is the one responsible for and I believe it's his right to bring this I'm only going to say what the prophet says if there's anything that he says he said say what's on the tapes say it just how I say try to interpret say it like it is if you say it like it is what the word says you are sure you can't lose when I try to interpret what the prophet problem is when I try to interpret what the word says that's where we get in trouble there's no need and I recommend you my heart has been in these last days we been crying out to the Lord Me A Sign speak to my heart I don't want to depend on reations of others I want my own revelation what other ones believed is not good for me I want what you give to me give me my own Revelation and faith is revelation without faith it's to please God so you need to be sure about something and I stay there I don't understand everything and I'm waiting on him a brother once told me I understand some things I didn't 10 years ago and as you're walking God is showing you and you're understanding there will be things later on that you'll understand that you don't understand now that's fine but if there's something I'm sure about is that the scripture says the dead in Christ 100% sure about that you are in Christ Jesus if you are inside him whomever plays the Trump whoever sounds the Trump you will rise if you are in him because the point is to be in him Abraham bought a property bought a property brother and he said there I will bury Sarah Abraham himself was buried in that place there was a place a literal place it was a piece of land Abraham bought and who else was buried there Isaac who else was buried there Jacob Joseph was why because they wanted to be because they wanted to be because they wanted to be there why did Joseph himself Joseph himself do not leave me in Egypt one dayall one day God one day he will visit us and don't leave me here take me with you me in that spot a specific place because he believed that in that place would be the resurrection a specific location now in the scripture says there's another a place and that place with all of my heart is in Christ Jesus he's the rock Alpha and Omega is the beginning and end is everything for me I'm not waiting on anyone else I'm waiting on him I'm waiting on him one day he'll raise me up one day he'll raise me me up even job job was buried on that s way before in the back he was buried in that place there's a specific place that you need to make sure that you are there and I tell you Brothers especially men heads of household you are responsible of your family don't wait for anyone to go kill to feed your family don't be lazy go kill and eat go kill and eat and give to your family because they depend on you depend on what you receive what are you receiving second hand Revelation what do you believe at this point at this point we're speaking the shout voice of Archangel have you gone to read the scripture have you went into study the message or do you not care about your family do you not care about your own soul do you not care about what you believe you need to make sure I told my son don't only say Amen make sure sure what you're is the word return to the word return to where you left Jesus there he'll be waiting for you there he'll keep waiting for you the prophet says I know I can't read I can send you all these scriptures all the scriptures the Bible also tells us I'm just going to read a few quotes from The Prophet the message go and tell my disciples the prophet says when he lived here on Earth he walked as a man he looked like a man his outward being as a man yet inwardly he was more than mankind uel it was Emmanuel today is a memorial of the greatest event that ever taken place in all the world Listen brother please there never was a manide of this man Christ Jesus who said I have power to lay my life down and have power to take up again power to take life up again all the prophets dead they all died there was not one that could raise another this man Jesus this man had the power to lay his life only lay it down but to raise it back he's the one with the [Applause] power Raise Me Up and in that he calls my name one day and he says my name that he has the power to raise me up brother BR is quoting here the prophet says in the message Revelation chapter 4 part one this as I've often said I know as a mortal then he says a name Rodney I know that there's a big Dark Door set before me it's called Death every time my heart beats I'm one beat closer to that door this is Brother brandham speaking some of these days I got to go into it in what death my question is did the prophet die or no okay all right but I don't want to go in like a coward screaming and hollering I want to go in there wrapping myself in the Robes of his righteousness you must make sure brother when you go there you are wrapped in him that's why I titled my sermon in Christ Jesus in Christ their come you are safe there brother Bram says wrapping myself in the Robes of righteousness knowing this that I know him in the power of his resurrection that some day when he [Music] calls when he caed me to appear on when the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise if I'm alive I'll be in a moment a twinkle of an IR shall go forth with the rest of them up to meet the Lord in the air that trumpet voice sound clear loud the prophet says oh it will be the same the same at his coming one more the cruelty of sin I was crucified with Christ yet I live not me but Christ lives in me someday in that glorious Resurrection when he comes my body may be resting beneath the S out yonder how many have been to Jeffersonville is a is a prophet's body not resting is he not resting there is he not waiting on him what he's saying or am I Mis interpreting the message rendering my own interpretation okay when he comes my body may be resting beneath the S out yonder but when it does you'll see the grass move back and I will come forth and his great glorious image beside a many [Applause] of for I know him in the power of his resurrection I trust that's every one of you tonight craw right up to goju hallu this is all I wanted to read you this is what brother brandham is saying I can't say different I'm reading what he says if you want your own conclusion jump to it if you want to believe whatever you want but I can't get into detail what I can say is our pastor brother Titus that he may bring this because we depend a lot on this our souls depend on this there is a lot but don't stay with what somebody told you don't
