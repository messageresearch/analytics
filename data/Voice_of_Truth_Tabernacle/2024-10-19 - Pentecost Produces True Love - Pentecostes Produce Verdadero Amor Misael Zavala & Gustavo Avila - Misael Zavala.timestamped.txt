[27:31] California Peru
[27:36] Peruan and all those who watch through
[27:38] the
[27:39] internet and the word says like
[27:54] this if you love me keep my Commandments
[27:57] and I will pray the father and he shall
[27:59] give you another comforter that he may
[28:01] abide with you
[28:13] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[28:15] the world cannot receive because it
[28:16] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[28:19] know him and he dwelleth with you and
[28:20] shall be in you
[28:33] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[28:35] come to you yet a little while and the
[28:37] world seeth me no more but ye see me
[28:39] because I live ye shall also live
[28:48] also and on that day you shall know that
[28:50] I am in my father and ye in me and I you
[29:02] he that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[29:04] them he it is that loveth me and he that
[29:06] loveth me shall be led of my father and
[29:09] I will love him and will manifest myself
[29:11] to him
[29:14] amen I'll be jumping to verse 25
[29:33] these things I have spoken unto you
[29:34] being yet present with you but the
[29:36] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[29:38] the father will send in my name he shall
[29:39] teach you all things and bring all
[29:41] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[29:43] have said unto
[29:45] you may you please bow your
[29:48] heads beloved Heavenly
[29:50] Father Lord we give you
[29:53] thanks for giving us the
[29:55] opportunity to hear your word
[29:58] I ask you now
[30:00] Lord may it be you
[30:04] speaking and for those that are
[30:07] needy may you give them what they
[30:11] need open the hearts and the and the
[30:14] ears of those who are
[30:16] hearing help me and my
[30:20] interpreter and my brother Gustavo and
[30:23] his interpreter
[30:24] Lord we place this service in your hands
[30:28] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen
[30:31] you may take your
[30:34] seats here we are
[30:40] seeing before the Lord is
[30:44] crucified he is telling
[30:46] them that he is going
[30:50] away but he'll send the Holy
[30:56] Ghost he says he will beg the
[31:00] father now after
[31:03] that he is crucified and
[31:07] dies as it has been spoken to us in
[31:09] previous
[31:12] preachings and after defeating Satan in
[31:17] hell that Roman seal they placed on the
[31:19] tomb was
[31:23] broken and now Life Starts to sprout out
[31:28] the tomb is removed or the stone is
[31:31] removed and this night
[31:33] youth if you have a
[31:37] stone let's hope that the Lord Jesus
[31:39] Christ can remove
[31:41] it of course you need to be willing for
[31:45] that so the Lord can rub any stone in
[31:48] your
[31:49] heart to receive
[31:52] him now he rises amongst the Dead
[31:55] [Music]
[31:59] and forgive me I'm talking about
[32:01] Pentecost my brother Gustavo and I as a
[32:07] title we place Pentecost produces true
[32:11] love so
[32:13] then when he
[32:15] rises amongst the
[32:18] dead and at
[32:22] Pentecost he he lasts 40 days
[32:28] so that Pentecost could be
[32:31] fulfilled when he ascended to
[32:36] heaven and the apostles unite
[32:40] together in the upper
[32:43] room they t 10 days
[32:46] more so there is 50 days which is
[32:51] Pentecost I won't get too into that
[32:59] uh I'd like to read acts 1
[33:18] six when they therefore came together
[33:21] and asked him saying Lord will thou at
[33:23] this time restore again the kingdom to
[33:24] Israel and he said unto them it is not
[33:26] for you to know the times nor the
[33:28] seasons which the father had put in his
[33:30] power in his own
[33:40] power but you shall receive power after
[33:42] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[33:44] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[33:46] Jerusalem and all Judea Judea and in
[33:49] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[33:50] the Earth
[34:06] and when he had spoken these things
[34:07] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[34:09] cloud received him out of their sight
[34:11] and while they looked steadfastly toward
[34:12] Heaven as he went up behold two men
[34:14] stood by them in white apparel
[34:29] which also said ye men of Galilee why
[34:31] stand ye gazing up into heaven these
[34:33] same this same Jesus which is taken up
[34:35] from you into heaven shall also come in
[34:37] like manner as ye have seen him go into
[34:47] heaven then returned they unto Jerusalem
[34:50] from the mount called ol which is from
[34:52] Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey
[34:58] ju and
[34:59] phip m al
[35:05] Sim and when they were come in they went
[35:07] into the upper room where AB both Peter
[35:09] and James and John and Andrew Philip and
[35:12] Thomas and Barth Barth and Matthew James
[35:16] and Son of alus and Simon zelot and
[35:19] Judas the brother of James
[35:30] these all continued with one according
[35:31] prayer and supplication with the women
[35:33] and Mary the mother of Jesus and with
[35:35] his
[35:38] Brethren now we're seeing the ascending
[35:41] of Jesus to
[35:43] heaven and he promises again the holy
[35:47] spirit that will not leave them
[35:52] comfortless he would beg the fathers to
[35:54] not leave them orphans
[35:59] uh but in verse
[36:04] 14 it says they were in one Accord in
[36:07] prayer and
[36:09] supplication and one mind in the
[36:12] heart one sole
[36:16] purpose of course for this they needed
[36:20] obedience it's very difficult for us
[36:24] sometimes not just the Lord
[36:28] sometimes to our parents to the
[36:32] pastor to the leaders of the
[36:35] church it's easy for us to
[36:42] Rebel but we must come to the point
[36:44] where we're in one Accord with the word
[36:45] of
[36:47] God now I'll place an example
[36:52] uh when you youth make a
[36:55] gathering when you make an event
[37:01] uh perhaps they ask
[37:03] you what do you need or what's your
[37:07] opinion for example what food would you
[37:10] like to
[37:11] bring perhaps some people say chicken
[37:14] are there's some
[37:17] pizzas maybe back there someone raises
[37:19] their
[37:20] hand and says animal
[37:25] crackers now that's not where they
[37:27] should be in one
[37:30] Accord where they should be in one
[37:32] Accord is the purpose of the
[37:36] event what are you going to
[37:38] do with what Spirit are you taking this
[37:41] matter
[37:45] why how will you realize the spirit you
[37:48] have Tak that you're taking this
[37:51] seriously you you get to a
[37:55] decision and many people have different
[37:59] opinions at the end one sole opinion
[38:01] will be
[38:03] left what you should
[38:07] observe is what type of spirit you come
[38:09] out of that
[38:11] Gathering are you mad at towards the
[38:13] other
[38:13] youth are you
[38:15] happy are you in
[38:19] agreement What Spirit are you
[38:22] taking What Spirit are you leaving from
[38:25] that Gathering
[38:33] since the Old Testament there's been a
[38:37] promise why because the Holy Ghost is
[38:39] promised to everyone in
[38:42] general for those of the message the
[38:47] denominations and even those who don't
[38:49] go to
[38:52] church I'll be reading Joel 228
[39:06] and it shall come pass afterward that I
[39:08] will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[39:09] and your sons and your daughters shall
[39:11] prophesy and your old men shall dream
[39:13] dreams and your young men shall see
[39:20] visions and also upon the servants and
[39:22] upon the handmaids in those days I will
[39:23] pour out my spirit prophe it's a
[39:26] prophecy
[39:32] later on says before the
[39:36] great so it's in these
[39:40] times now in
[39:44] 29 I want to make a separation
[39:50] here in verse 28 says my spirit will
[39:53] pour out on upon All Flesh in in general
[39:59] matter if you're from the message or Den
[40:02] denominational he will pour out his
[40:04] Spirit but in
[40:06] 29 he makes a
[40:09] separation and because he says and
[40:17] also upon the servants and the handmaids
[40:20] in those days will I pour out my
[40:23] spirit so that touches the true children
[40:25] of God to the
[40:28] to the
[40:29] elected
[40:32] why because it's not for
[40:35] everyone brother Bram typifies in
[40:39] Exodus Exodus
[40:45] 26 through
[40:47] Moses they were taken out of
[40:51] Egypt when we're they're taken out of
[40:53] Egypt taken to the
[40:56] wilderness brother BR typifies it with
[40:58] the
[41:01] Mana the Mana came down every
[41:07] day but if they stored it it would
[41:14] rot that was left on the
[41:17] floor it would
[41:21] melt but there in
[41:23] [Music]
[41:25] Exodus God ordains
[41:29] Moses and Moses tells
[41:32] Aaron that that first
[41:35] Mana he should pick it
[41:37] up and place it before
[41:40] Jehovah
[41:42] where in the Holy
[41:46] place what does this
[41:49] mean in the holiest place not anyone
[41:51] could
[41:53] enter only the high priest could enter
[41:55] there
[41:57] now this
[42:01] Mana Jehovah tells him to keep it for
[42:04] his
[42:05] descendant what
[42:07] descendant us but in
[42:13] Exodus in the Old Testament The
[42:16] Descendants are the
[42:19] priests because only the priest could
[42:21] enter the holiest
[42:24] place uh
[42:30] I want to read a hidden life preached in
[42:49] 1955 now when they eat this man remember
[42:51] they eat it many people eat it and said
[42:53] this is it they had to gather it fresh
[42:55] every day that's right they had to
[42:56] gather the fresh every day because along
[42:59] about 9:00 on their second step it would
[43:01] go melting it would perish
[43:53] and many times people living in God's
[43:55] second room even in communion after they
[43:57] already received the word and come into
[43:59] the second step of receiving Christ into
[44:00] their life and never yet know that the
[44:02] secet and never yet know what the that
[44:05] secret room is what that bedroom what
[44:07] the rest place is they eat that Mana but
[44:10] did you notice that if they lay too long
[44:12] if finally melted out there was it
[44:15] perished away and I think a lot of
[44:16] people had had a lot of Campground
[44:18] cramps anyhow and when they go to eat
[44:21] the Lord and on on the campground and
[44:23] before another revival can be come along
[44:26] they're all back twisted up in some kind
[44:28] of cult or something else what's the
[44:29] matter brother you've never walked in
[44:31] somewhere
[44:34] else now age doesn't
[44:37] matter you can enter into that
[44:42] room 10 11 12 13 14 15 years
[44:46] old does not matter how young you
[44:50] are matters is the communion you have
[44:52] with
[44:53] God not the days of
[44:55] service in any moment
[44:59] why we all want to receive the Holy
[45:02] Ghost we all want to be
[45:04] filled but we should make the
[45:07] effort sometimes the Devil comes with
[45:09] his lies like in the
[45:12] world they tell you enjoy your
[45:15] young but what do you
[45:18] prefer enjoy your your your youthfulness
[45:21] in this
[45:25] world or enjoy your youthfulness in
[45:28] eternity it's two
[45:32] options you can live here and live
[45:36] freely and pretend like you're
[45:39] fine appear like you're
[45:42] rejoicing but you have the option to
[45:44] Rejoice over
[45:47] there don't don't waste your
[45:49] youth surrender to
[45:53] god7 he says
[46:11] God said Moses make your golden pot
[46:13] Allelujah and there placed this mana and
[46:15] remember that a Believer when he walked
[46:16] in there that Mana never did run out it
[46:19] was always fresh and new and sweet as
[46:20] the days went by as the years went by
[46:51] and any man who comes to Christ and
[46:53] hides away and the veil falls behind him
[46:55] he's in the presence of almighty God
[46:56] eating the Mana day and night from one
[46:58] hour to another it's always as just as
[47:00] sweet as it was the first day of telling
[47:02] to your soul that's what we need today
[47:04] is to get into the things are not not
[47:07] stand off and pretend or not stand off
[47:09] and act but actually get in there
[47:13] amen now that Mana typifies the Holy
[47:17] Ghost mes picked it up in the
[47:21] beginning that Mana before the Lord
[47:28] lasted the 40 years they were in the
[47:30] wilderness until they entered into the
[47:32] promised
[47:34] land and the holy ghost that was given
[47:36] in the upper room today it is fresh
[47:40] [Music]
[47:42] Youth and it will not run out until we
[47:44] leave
[47:46] here but it's up to you if you want to
[47:49] enter and take of that fresh
[47:52] Mana now for that you need
[47:54] dedication dedicate your life
[47:57] make the
[47:59] effort Place more of your
[48:03] part if you put two parts of your life
[48:08] put another two and then add another
[48:14] two I'd like to read in dedication
[48:17] preached in 62
[48:29] and when his body had been made a
[48:31] sacrifice the correct lamb had been
[48:32] sacrificed there was coming forth God
[48:34] came into his old body which was his
[48:36] bride and there had been
[49:06] and there have been 120 temples that God
[49:08] created was ready for dedication that
[49:10] had got all their unbelief beat out of
[49:12] them and they gathered in the upper room
[49:14] and waited for 10 days for dedicational
[49:15] service then when completely surrendered
[49:18] surrendered God came down again in the
[49:20] Shina glory and filled all the house
[49:22] where they were
[49:23] sitting now it won't be easy
[49:27] why because it said all
[49:30] unbelief God beat it out of
[49:33] them that's why you
[49:36] struggle that's why many times you say I
[49:38] can't no
[49:39] more I understand I was also
[49:43] young but you can do it
[49:46] brother young man young
[49:49] lady the only thing you need is to
[49:51] dedicate a little bit
[49:52] more day after day dedicate more
[49:57] obey God obey your
[49:59] parents if your parents bring
[50:05] you because many times we say we were
[50:08] brought here because my parents brought
[50:09] me
[50:11] here they don't bring you just to get
[50:14] lost they bring you so you can obtain
[50:17] eternal
[50:18] life why because your parents love
[50:21] you perhap perhaps you don't agree with
[50:24] them in a lot of things
[50:28] but agree with them in the
[50:31] word the church in that way even so the
[50:35] church the
[50:36] word in one
[50:38] Accord in one
[50:42] word so he can pour out his sh Glory
[50:45] here may God bless you
[50:58] God bless you God bless
[51:00] you can you turn around and greet your
[51:04] neighbor give him a
[51:07] smile because there's a lot of power in
[51:09] a
[51:11] smile there is a lot of power in a
[51:17] smile let's let's if you can please if
[51:20] they go to Galatians 5 verse
[51:27] and if you have notes you can write it
[51:30] down the title of this
[51:34] message Pentecost produces true
[51:40] love amen amen Pentecost produces True
[51:47] Love Tonight with the help of the Holy
[51:50] Spirit if he allows
[51:53] me I going be basing a little bit what I
[51:55] uh my thoughts
[51:58] tonight with what brother Bram says in
[52:00] the
[52:02] message but let us go to Galatians
[52:05] chapter 5 verse
[52:08] 19 here we have two
[52:11] things the
[52:13] Flesh and then the the fruits of the
[52:16] spirit
[52:18] amen it says now the works of the flesh
[52:21] are manifested which are these adultery
[52:24] fornication uncleanliness l
[52:35] Idol idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[52:40] emulations wrath Strife s sedation if
[52:44] I'm saying that right SED seditions
[52:46] thank you and heresies
[52:57] envying murders drunkenness re revealing
[53:00] and such
[53:05] like all right we understand that I know
[53:09] it's a lot but that's why I say write it
[53:11] down you can go read it
[53:14] later now let's go to verse 22 it
[53:18] says but the fruits of the spirit
[53:21] is what's the first one
[53:27] love and we just
[53:30] said Pentecost produces true
[53:34] love and it continues love joy peace
[53:36] long suffering gentleness goodness and
[53:43] Faith meekness Temperance against such
[53:46] there is no
[53:50] law all right now I'm going to bring you
[53:53] back to the message brother brandham
[53:55] says
[53:58] why is it that so many Christians find
[54:00] it so hard to live a Christian
[54:04] Life I think we all know this this
[54:07] message amen we've all read
[54:09] it as a young man I've read this message
[54:11] a lot of
[54:13] times brother Bram says
[54:16] this Pentecost is an
[54:21] experience amen do we have Christian
[54:23] Believers
[54:24] here amen amen and he says an
[54:30] experience that constrains
[54:32] you to the love of
[54:35] God
[54:37] constrain in other words it pushes
[54:41] you it drives you to the love of
[54:46] God every time brother brandham says
[54:48] Pentecost is an
[54:52] experience he always ties it
[54:56] or connected to not an organization or
[55:04] denomination ain't that right in other
[55:07] words a way of a system if you can call
[55:10] it or a way of
[55:13] thinking how things should
[55:16] be again we're talking about
[55:19] Pentecost the experience of
[55:22] Pentecost and as young people
[55:26] you know you we strive for that
[55:31] mostly and a true genuine experience
[55:34] with God
[55:37] amen amen youth are you guys here
[55:41] because this is our
[55:43] service a true genuine experience with
[55:48] God but many of the times as
[55:51] humans and adults do it as
[55:54] well we compare
[55:57] lives We compare Our Lives to
[56:00] others how they're doing how they're
[56:03] going and because we compare our
[56:07] lives with their lives we start to find
[56:11] our flaws
[56:13] right our differences between that
[56:15] person and the
[56:18] other I know it's
[56:21] obvious we've been told time and time
[56:23] again
[56:26] don't base or compare yourself to
[56:27] someone's
[56:29] life but compare yourself to the
[56:33] word compare yourself to what God's word
[56:38] says because when you see a person's
[56:42] life here at church at home you're
[56:47] simply seeing the
[56:51] keyhole You're simply seeing their life
[56:53] through a keyhole
[56:56] you're not seeing their whole
[56:58] life that's why I say it
[57:01] again compare yourself to the
[57:04] word and that's why we just read
[57:06] Galatians right
[57:08] now and that's why I said Pentecost
[57:11] produces true
[57:14] love because you have the works of the
[57:16] of the flesh
[57:18] right and then you have the of the then
[57:20] the fruits of the
[57:22] spirit brother Bram says the devil can
[57:25] IM
[57:28] Ates all
[57:29] things except one
[57:32] thing and that's love
[57:36] brother and that's what Pentecost
[57:39] is it produces true
[57:42] love but many times as young
[57:45] people and adults as well we doubt we we
[57:50] have
[57:51] reasoning ain't that right am I the only
[57:54] one am I the only one that ask
[57:56] themselves question after question day
[57:58] by
[58:00] day because I believe a true son and
[58:02] daughter of
[58:04] God checks himself
[58:08] daily questions are every step of the
[58:12] way and if you're
[58:15] not then today is a good day to
[58:19] start cuz Brothers young men young
[58:23] ladies they saying a light battle
[58:28] it's not a light
[58:30] battle we have to check ourselves every
[58:32] step of the
[58:35] way checked our experience much
[58:38] yes no
[58:40] doubting not doubting but check it not
[58:45] with someone else's life but with the
[58:46] word of
[58:49] God cuz many people
[58:52] say and I've been
[58:54] there oh brother Gustavo
[58:57] I've had an experience with the
[58:59] Lord I jumped and shouted and did this
[59:02] did
[59:03] that oh it was something I couldn't
[59:07] control brother sister that's
[59:10] yes I'm not trying to steal that away
[59:12] from
[59:13] you it's part of it yes but it's not all
[59:18] it brother M just read
[59:21] it I will pour out my spirit upon All
[59:24] Flesh
[59:29] right but then he said servants
[59:34] right in other words those that want
[59:38] more work for
[59:40] something I'm going read this quote from
[59:42] brother
[59:44] brandham he says in the message what it
[59:46] takes to overcome all
[59:51] unbelief our faith brother Bram he said
[59:56] he says you already have you have
[59:59] already supplied everything in
[1:00:03] you everything is in inside of
[1:00:06] you but he says so many people
[1:00:10] today I find when they join
[1:00:14] church and here especially in
[1:00:17] America they just become
[1:00:21] Drifters now listen to this and when
[1:00:25] brother Bram said this I said I was the
[1:00:27] first
[1:00:30] one he says he calls them
[1:00:34] Drifters he says you never got saved
[1:00:37] just to be a member of a
[1:00:41] church you got saved to
[1:00:46] work come
[1:00:48] on you got saved to work brother bam
[1:00:53] says so I just because I came to
[1:00:58] service I felt a chill on my
[1:01:03] back I I did
[1:01:06] enough to justify my actions of the day
[1:01:10] of
[1:01:12] yesterday no it's needed of
[1:01:15] more dig more work more check yourself
[1:01:19] every step of the
[1:01:21] way he says we got we got saved to work
[1:01:27] amen and I love this we don't dress an
[1:01:30] army up just to lay around of the corner
[1:01:33] and flirt with the
[1:01:35] [Music]
[1:01:42] girls with pretty Uniforms
[1:01:46] on it doesn't close
[1:01:49] anymore but you get it you look nice
[1:01:53] here you look the parts
[1:01:57] but what's
[1:02:00] inside we fill everything out
[1:02:03] here what's going on
[1:02:08] here he
[1:02:10] says we train our army to
[1:02:16] fight fight against our own
[1:02:20] selves fighting again fighting against
[1:02:23] my own reasoning
[1:02:27] my own way of
[1:02:29] thinking because the greatest enemy that
[1:02:31] Gustavo
[1:02:33] has is
[1:02:36] Gustav and that Gustavo a doesn't
[1:02:40] like checking himself with the word day
[1:02:42] by
[1:02:44] day because every single day he sees
[1:02:48] that while he's
[1:02:51] living what he's
[1:02:53] doing he's missing the targets
[1:02:58] and it
[1:02:59] hurts cuz then you have to drop you have
[1:03:02] to bring down your
[1:03:05] ego it brings down your
[1:03:08] pride and makes you realize where you're
[1:03:11] really
[1:03:13] at and checks your
[1:03:17] experience if it's real or
[1:03:20] not cuz if it's of
[1:03:23] God it'll produce God
[1:03:26] right amen again we all want to have
[1:03:30] that genuine
[1:03:33] experience that ex Pentecost
[1:03:38] experience is it all right if I'm
[1:03:40] talking simple
[1:03:42] tonight glory to God brother
[1:03:46] Bram one time was talking to a young
[1:03:49] man this young man had gone to church
[1:03:52] after church
[1:03:56] wanting a true genuine
[1:04:00] experience he wants something real right
[1:04:02] we all want something real
[1:04:05] right cuz only the real stuff will
[1:04:10] last and emotion is going to come and
[1:04:15] go this young man tells brother
[1:04:19] brandham brother Bram I went to so and
[1:04:22] so
[1:04:24] evangelist and he told me to to do this
[1:04:26] that and
[1:04:27] this this other evangelist told me to go
[1:04:30] into a room and pray until I speak in
[1:04:34] tongues but but some just something just
[1:04:38] doesn't sit with
[1:04:40] me something just doesn't connect
[1:04:45] right brother bam talks to the young
[1:04:50] man and talks to him about his
[1:04:53] experience when he accepted the Lord
[1:04:55] Jesus Jesus
[1:04:56] Christ he asked him when you accepted
[1:05:02] him and you went back to your
[1:05:05] life and you went to do the same things
[1:05:07] that you
[1:05:09] did did you feel
[1:05:11] something did you feel your something
[1:05:14] truly deep inside your
[1:05:18] heart pulling you back from
[1:05:22] that he says yes brother br
[1:05:26] it's very
[1:05:28] simple what you're just telling
[1:05:31] me is that you've had a true genuine
[1:05:35] experience but you haven't realized it
[1:05:39] yet and many of the times that's how we
[1:05:42] are the devil has to do his
[1:05:46] part he has to mix throw thoughts to our
[1:05:52] minds makes us doubt
[1:05:56] makes us reason
[1:05:59] against but brother brandham
[1:06:02] says that if you feel
[1:06:06] something that when you used to do
[1:06:10] things you don't feel right with
[1:06:13] it obviously we can say it's
[1:06:17] God but do don't stay
[1:06:20] there add
[1:06:23] on work build upon
[1:06:27] that and keep on working deeper and
[1:06:31] deeper because if you just stay with the
[1:06:33] superficial
[1:06:35] stuff as easy as the wind comes by it's
[1:06:38] going to blow it all
[1:06:40] way and then you're going to find
[1:06:42] yourself falling
[1:06:44] again this may seem very very basic
[1:06:49] stuff but I think it's
[1:06:52] necessary the ABCs
[1:06:56] what's the point of
[1:06:58] algebra what's the point of the
[1:07:01] Mysteries what's the point of our pastor
[1:07:03] preaching on Sunday
[1:07:07] mornings on Wednesday
[1:07:09] nights on the
[1:07:12] Rapture if we can't get this
[1:07:17] down if we can't truly check ourselves
[1:07:19] and be honest
[1:07:21] for be real with myself
[1:07:25] cuz I could
[1:07:27] say yes I had an
[1:07:30] experience like I said the devil can
[1:07:33] intim imitate the
[1:07:36] rest but not
[1:07:43] love brother Bram
[1:07:46] says he says this I'm g go to this
[1:07:49] message he
[1:07:52] says he Compares that spirit in Acts 22
[1:07:58] 17 when he says I shall pour out my in
[1:08:01] in the last days God says I will pour
[1:08:02] out my spirit upon All
[1:08:06] Flesh brother brand says he connects
[1:08:08] that to an apple
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:12] tree he says then what is these other
[1:08:18] things it's
[1:08:20] attributes apples that fall off the tree
[1:08:23] see
[1:08:26] but don't get the Apple for the
[1:08:30] tree get the tree and it will bear the
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:35] apples you can all you can have all the
[1:08:38] signs and F Fant Fantastics you
[1:08:45] want to pick up under the tree and still
[1:08:48] not have the
[1:08:53] tree the trees got the
[1:08:57] life he says and
[1:08:59] continues you see you're just taking
[1:09:02] something that fell off the
[1:09:05] tree get the tree
[1:09:07] first and it will bear
[1:09:11] itself but if your tree isn't yielding
[1:09:15] these
[1:09:18] things there it
[1:09:20] is then there's something
[1:09:24] wrong that's what you want he
[1:09:28] says is that what you want
[1:09:30] church is that what you want young man
[1:09:32] young
[1:09:34] sister when you do
[1:09:37] something or when you have an experience
[1:09:39] you had
[1:09:40] a with God but then you go
[1:09:44] back and you find yourself in the same
[1:09:52] thing it was just all superficial
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:56] nothing deep inside TR
[1:10:00] happened and the reason why is because
[1:10:03] you didn't let it remain
[1:10:12] enough we simply come to
[1:10:17] service yes with our
[1:10:21] problems but we raise our hands just
[1:10:23] enough
[1:10:25] we listen
[1:10:27] enough just so that we can go
[1:10:31] back and justify our
[1:10:35] actions carry on hold on to that
[1:10:40] hatred hold on to that
[1:10:44] jealousy CU that's
[1:10:47] hard hating someone is
[1:10:50] hard but there's so many
[1:10:53] people that I've been there
[1:10:57] I would rather stay with
[1:11:01] that rather live a life like
[1:11:05] that
[1:11:09] blind they say I'm rich but I am
[1:11:16] poor they say they have it all but they
[1:11:18] have
[1:11:21] nothing if you don't have love then you
[1:11:23] have nothing
[1:11:26] and true Pentecost produces true
[1:11:30] love but we got to check
[1:11:32] it check it with the
[1:11:35] word every step of the
[1:11:38] way it says in first
[1:11:41] Timothy I'm gonna I'm GNA be closing out
[1:11:45] chapter four it
[1:11:46] says verse one and
[1:11:49] two now the spirit speaketh expressedly
[1:11:55] that in the latter
[1:11:57] times are we not in the latter
[1:12:01] times then this scripture is telling
[1:12:04] me that it's talking about right
[1:12:09] now that in the latter times some shall
[1:12:12] depart from the
[1:12:17] faith giving heed to seducing
[1:12:21] spirits and doctrines of devils
[1:12:26] that doesn't happen here
[1:12:28] right verse two
[1:12:31] though speaking lies in
[1:12:36] hypocrisy but I like this
[1:12:38] part and when I read
[1:12:41] this I truly believe it was
[1:12:44] God having their conscience seared with
[1:12:48] an iron hot
[1:12:52] IR you know what it is to have a sheared
[1:12:58] conscience is that you can't feel
[1:13:01] it Judas had a sear
[1:13:07] conscience the Bible says that he
[1:13:10] stole but yet he was still doing the
[1:13:12] works of
[1:13:14] God killing
[1:13:16] people going out doing the
[1:13:19] works every time that he stole from the
[1:13:24] offering he had a sear
[1:13:27] conscience cuz what he felt on the
[1:13:30] outside what he did here at
[1:13:32] church Justified what his
[1:13:40] wrong please
[1:13:48] stand what we just read in Galatians
[1:13:55] brother
[1:13:57] bham says that all the devil does with
[1:14:00] God's
[1:14:04] creation is he simply
[1:14:07] perverts adultery and fornication is a
[1:14:10] perversion of
[1:14:16] love all the works of the flesh is
[1:14:18] simply a perversion of
[1:14:20] love all the works of the
[1:14:23] flesh is just a simple perversion of the
[1:14:26] love the love of
[1:14:31] God and we and that's why I say we got
[1:14:33] to check ourselves because many of the
[1:14:35] times I've been
[1:14:39] there where we try to stand we we do
[1:14:44] things because we say oh it's because of
[1:14:48] love I stand up myself because I got to
[1:14:51] love myself I stand up for myself
[1:14:54] because I got to love myself first I got
[1:14:56] to protect myself I love my family
[1:14:59] therefore I got to protect
[1:15:01] them from anything that anyone says
[1:15:03] about
[1:15:05] them and the way I react is because of
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:13] love we say we
[1:15:16] love but we act like
[1:15:19] Peter drawing our
[1:15:22] sword in the action of love
[1:15:27] protecting
[1:15:28] Jesus and slicing off an
[1:15:32] ear but then here comes my
[1:15:36] Jesus showing true
[1:15:40] love holding his
[1:15:44] tongue holding his tongue when they
[1:15:46] pulled out his
[1:15:49] beard said nothing when they hit him on
[1:15:52] his head
[1:15:56] that's true
[1:15:57] love and that's a hard kind of
[1:16:02] love CU while we're still in this
[1:16:06] flesh we're going to fight against this
[1:16:09] flesh well that's
[1:16:13] why not only having an
[1:16:16] experience but make sure that
[1:16:20] experience produces true love
[1:16:28] let us
[1:16:29] pray gracious heavenly
[1:16:34] father I'm no one to say
[1:16:38] anything the first person with flaws
[1:16:44] isav the first one that needs to be
[1:16:46] checked is Gustav
[1:16:49] a the person that thinks they're fine
[1:16:55] every time I look at your word
[1:16:58] Lord what my Prophet tells
[1:17:01] me the life of my
[1:17:05] Prophet it makes me feel so far away
[1:17:08] from
[1:17:11] you but God I want it
[1:17:15] bad cuz it's
[1:17:18] hard it ain't
[1:17:20] easy I want to do what I want to do
[1:17:25] I want to say what I want to
