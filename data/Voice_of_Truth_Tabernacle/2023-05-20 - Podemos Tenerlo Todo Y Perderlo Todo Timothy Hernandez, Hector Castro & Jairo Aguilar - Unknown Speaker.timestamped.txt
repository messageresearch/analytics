[20:47] you know who says you can't be at home

[20:52] you know we're doing something else
[20:55] but God has you here in this moment

[21:14] can you just meditate on that person
[21:19] everything that you've done
[21:22] God has brought you up to this momento
[21:28] I would like to
[21:29] thank my pastor for giving me the
[21:31] privilege
[21:33] you know and let's also be praying for
[21:36] our brothers and that are out yeah
[21:41] if we could please open our scriptures
[21:46] in the book of First Kings
[21:50] chapter 3
[21:52] verse 5 and 9.
[21:55] now we're speaking on Solomon estamos
[22:00] the son of David
[22:02] and the son of Bathsheba is
[22:12] and it says like this
[22:14] Jesse
[22:15] and gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon
[22:18] in a Dream by night and God said ask
[22:20] what I shall give thee
[22:22] is
[22:35] verse 6 and Solomon said thou it has
[22:37] shoot unto thy servant David my father
[22:39] great Mercy according as he walked
[22:42] before thee in truth and in
[22:43] righteousness and in uprightness of
[22:46] heart with thee that thou has kept him
[22:48] for his great kindness that thou has
[22:50] given him a son to sit on his throne as
[22:53] it is as it is this day
[22:55] is
[23:02] hijo
[23:27] verse 9 give therefore thy servant
[23:30] Solomon and understanding heart to judge
[23:33] thy people that I may discern between
[23:35] good and bad for who is able to judge
[23:37] this thy so great a people
[23:58] verse 10 and the speech pleased the Lord
[24:01] that Solomon had asked this thing is
[24:09] we can please bear our heads
[24:12] dear heavenly father Lord thank you for
[24:15] this privilege Lord Celestial gracias I
[24:18] do not feel worthy Lord of standing here
[24:42] we might not understand it but just
[24:44] believe it Lord
[24:49] Senor thank you for this night Lord
[24:51] gracias may you guide my words Lord
[24:56] I put this service in your hands
[24:59] as well as my interpreter and the
[25:01] following preachers
[25:05] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:12] so we're speaking on Solomon is
[25:15] Solomon being the son of David
[25:20] and the daughter of Bathsheba
[25:26] um
[25:26] and we see that throughout the book of
[25:29] First Kings chapter one
[25:34] we see that Not only was there Solomon
[25:38] but it was
[25:48] in English sorry Brothers
[25:50] but we see that there's two brothers
[25:53] right here
[25:54] you know once fighting to get the The
[25:57] Throne
[26:00] you know and one is at peace
[26:04] you know one is the name of Solomon is
[26:09] means beloved of the Lord
[26:14] another name that he also has is
[26:16] peaceful
[26:20] and so we see that in the book of First
[26:23] Kings chapter one
[26:27] here's
[26:31] trying to get the throne
[26:35] you know but it wasn't in God's plan
[26:39] for him to get the throne
[26:43] but it was in fact Solomon
[26:47] who was it who was in God's will to get
[26:50] the throne
[26:53] so now if you don't understand a little
[26:55] bit of the story
[26:58] you know we have here two brothers
[27:02] akimiramos Dos Hermanos that are
[27:06] in other words
[27:10] in the
[27:13] process of getting the inheritance of
[27:15] the throne
[27:21] but we see that at the Niger
[27:24] you know he exalts himself
[27:29] you know he does all he does his banquet
[27:32] he does all this stuff
[27:35] you know but the Bible tells us
[27:38] that humble yourselves
[27:42] that we have to Humble ourselves
[27:46] and the Lord says if you do if you said
[27:50] he will lift you up
[27:54] amen
[27:57] in Psalm 75 it says for exhaustion comes
[28:01] neither from the East nor from the West
[28:03] nor from the South but God is the judge
[28:06] he puts down one and exalts another I
[28:08] don't have it in the verse excuse me
[28:10] amen
[28:11] uh go ahead
[28:13] but pretty much saying that God is gonna
[28:16] humble one
[28:17] is
[28:25] you know and King Solomon was one of the
[28:27] wisest men
[28:31] he was one of God even tells him you'll
[28:34] be one of the wisest men savios
[28:39] right and and God give to him with
[28:41] unsurpassed wisdom
[28:48] and um
[28:51] you know how many how many of us
[28:55] you know sometimes we exalt ourselves
[29:00] how many times have we done things to
[29:03] glorify ourselves foreign
[29:21] because that is what matters most
[29:24] significance
[29:27] amen and so
[29:30] along the towards the end of first Kings
[29:33] chapter one
[29:39] um
[29:40] you know Solomon is made King Salomon
[29:45] of Israel
[29:50] but but
[29:55] before Solomon becoming King
[30:00] you know she interceded
[30:05] for her son Solomon
[30:08] Salomon a mother interceding for her
[30:11] child
[30:15] how many mothers are here like that
[30:17] tonight
[30:23] man
[30:24] and so Bathsheba goes on to Solomon
[30:30] and she lets him know
[30:33] what is going on with
[30:40] and so as we go on to chapter two of
[30:43] First Kings
[30:49] um Solomon has adenaya killed
[30:56] salomonas
[30:58] and as well as Davis General joab yes
[31:05] correct because he challenged him
[31:09] you know and I go back to the same thing
[31:14] you have to fulfill your purpose for
[31:16] what God called you foreign
[31:56] and so as we go on to
[31:59] chapter three
[32:03] this is the most beautiful part about
[32:06] Solomon is
[32:11] the fact the words that he spoke to God
[32:18] of what he asked for from God
[32:22] you know
[32:24] Solomon didn't say oh give me money
[32:28] Solomon didn't say oh well make this
[32:32] person my enemy
[32:35] en Amigo no Solomon asked some wisdom
[32:42] and and sometimes
[32:45] Nosotros you know we go into our little
[32:47] prayer
[32:49] you know and we go asking God
[32:53] oh God I don't have money
[32:56] oh Lord help me in this or that
[33:01] Ernesto but why don't we ask the things
[33:02] that would please God
[33:05] Lord let me love my brother more
[33:10] my church more
[33:14] Lord let me be of help to you
[33:18] but no but sometimes we ask God for
[33:21] things that benefit us
[33:27] when in reality we should be asking God
[33:29] for things
[33:33] to help his throne
[33:37] you know and and that's that's
[33:41] and I I
[33:44] personally speaking for myself
[33:47] I think that if God came to me tonight
[33:52] if I was outside in the world
[33:56] and he came onto me and said what would
[33:59] you want
[34:02] well I'd want money
[34:05] well maybe fame
[34:08] maybe women
[34:12] but what about here
[34:15] what would you ask of God
[34:18] forgot to renew you okay
[34:21] for God to give you more of him
[34:26] man
[34:27] that's right and then he says may I that
[34:29] I may discern between good and bad
[34:38] man
[34:41] you know King Solomon
[34:47] he was a way a very wise person
[34:53] and later on in the story
[34:57] we see that Solomon Falls
[35:02] because he fell into things
[35:06] that did not pertain to God
[35:11] you know he fell into women
[35:16] and to the gods of their of his women
[35:23] and that's not what we want tonight
[35:25] we don't want a backslide
[35:29] for things that we don't need
[35:38] I like to read this quote from Brother
[35:39] Branham
[35:41] in the message believe is thou this is
[35:46] he says I believe Solomon
[35:49] had the most level prayer to God that I
[35:52] have ever heard
[36:01] he prayed that God wouldn't make him so
[36:03] rich that he would forget God
[36:08] [Music]
[36:15] and yet not to make him so poor that he
[36:18] wouldn't have to steal is
[36:26] so just the Comforts of of life is what
[36:30] we
[36:32] desires
[36:35] is
[36:37] that right and that's about where the
[36:41] most of us stand
[36:46] I guess and very fortunate and thankful
[36:49] to have that is
[36:56] okay
[36:57] so if I can leave you with one thing
[36:59] tonight
[37:04] is
[37:15] the trust God is
[37:22] thank you
[37:31] to trust them and not not forget about
[37:33] him
[37:37] like Solomon
[37:40] said
[37:42] God bless you brothers and sisters
[37:46] [Applause]
[38:01] for internet
[38:05] pastor
[38:09] is
[38:11] yes
[38:50] glory to God
[38:52] Hermanos
[39:11] foreign
[39:24] foreign
[39:35] Timothy
[39:42] okay
[39:48] we tried all this preaching we can gain
[39:51] and lose everything yes
[40:12] and Gabe and the Lord appeared to
[40:14] Solomon in a Dream by night and God said
[40:16] ask what I shall give thee is
[40:40] unto thy servant David my father great
[40:42] Mercy according as he walked before thee
[40:44] in truth and in righteousness and in
[40:46] brightness of Harwood thee and thou has
[40:48] kept for him this great kindness that
[40:50] thou has given him a son to sit on his
[40:52] throne as it is this day
[40:54] is
[41:06] made thy servant King instead of David
[41:09] my father and I am but a little child I
[41:12] know not how to go out or come in
[41:17] when he says here I am a little child is
[41:21] here
[42:21] glory to God
[42:23] glory to God
[42:26] here we can see Brethren
[42:30] that God asked told Solomon to ask what
[42:33] he wanted
[42:35] now I ask you a question
[42:39] what would we ask for brother
[42:43] so let's think about it what would we
[42:45] ask for
[42:48] fame yes
[42:56] is that
[42:58] we could ask for many things
[43:02] but if we begin
[43:06] Solomon says that is
[43:18] with 300 concubines
[43:33] glory god
[43:38] is
[43:39] once brethren
[43:41] is a
[43:43] lady
[43:44] I tell you we should always be an
[43:46] expectation
[43:53] because God can speak
[44:04] his name was preaching
[44:12] and
[44:35] that young woman
[44:48] and brother the brother
[44:51] you can ask for a million dollars
[45:42] glory to God
[45:58] if God told me
[46:05] God has asked us that before
[46:45] this is
[47:05] that's not enough we need to teach them
[47:09] Glory God God help us brethren
[47:15] a little more brethren
[47:18] this is
[47:24] from the message
[47:26] yes
[47:30] says you know Faith cometh by hearing
[47:32] okay
[47:34] let me rewind a little brother is
[47:44] finally way down in the uh most parts of
[47:47] the Known World there was a little Queen
[47:49] a heathen and she's called the queen of
[47:51] the South
[47:53] which was
[47:59] and she was away across the deserts to
[48:02] where her country was
[48:12] and everyone passing through would say
[48:14] oh you should be up in Jerusalem up in
[48:16] Palestine for they have a great God up
[48:18] there is
[48:24] Peron
[48:29] in
[48:31] um
[48:35] who has visited them with a great gift
[48:37] and signs and wonders are taking place
[48:39] by one named Solomon whom they have made
[48:41] King this is God's word says
[48:46] because Solomon asked for it God gave
[48:50] him wisdom is
[48:56] us
[49:00] I was resonating worldwide
[49:04] Solomon's wisdom yeah
[49:09] there were many people coming to ask for
[49:12] advice
[49:13] here we're going to get to the Queen of
[49:15] Sheba
[49:16] perumos before this brethren
[49:21] is
[49:23] he says and First Kings 3 16.
[49:27] I'm just going to read it fast
[49:31] says two harlots arrived
[49:35] and they asked them what do you want
[49:38] they said
[49:40] and they said what's going on is that
[49:42] we're living
[49:45] and both of us gave birth and we tried
[49:48] but while we slept
[49:51] while they slept this woman drowned hers
[49:59] the one that was dead
[50:04] every child and took the child that was
[50:07] alive
[50:08] okay so King Solomon said
[50:12] let's see who the real mother is
[50:19] [Music]
[50:48] so what were they going to do Yama
[51:40] [Music]
[51:51] esta
[52:02] she heard of a man with a lot of wisdom
[52:04] but it doesn't say yes yes but then she
[52:07] said what is it or is it not true
[52:11] and so she was willing to go and find
[52:14] out

[53:03] is
