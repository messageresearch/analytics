hiding so this is why the Sunday school teacher told me you weren't turning in homework because they're hiding it so this is the Sunday school teacher homework huh it's still homework so one two so it's three questions okay did you guys already do it says that you had to talk about it and have it ready for next Sunday you guys both gotta do it okay I have to do it for you guys I can help you guys if you want you guys want me to help you yeah yeah okay I'll tell you guys a story about two prisoners since it's homework is about prisoners you guys want to hear it yeah yeah all right let's go on over just don't forget that you guys are gonna help me with the food later okay all right so this story is about two Christians the first Christian's name is sister Teresa now sister Teresa is constantly Walking with God she has peace and joy and faith she strengthens her faith by reading the word of God and listening to messages she's always putting it into action as well by prayer or sharing the gospel to others she seems like a good Christian doesn't she uh-huh now the second Christian his life is going a little different right now it's brother Pierre brother peer is going through a desert in his Christian Journey he's not sure why God chose him in doubt sometimes if he's really a child of God the spirit of depression and pride have been holding him down all of those evil spirits they've been tormenting him calling him a hypocrite and a liar they're always reminding him of his past and pointing out all of his flaws that's not really nice huh now brother peer he sees that his life isn't really going so good he's not the Christian that he thinks that he should be so he admires the life of sister Teresa always wishing that his could be just like hers however any time he goes to a fellow brother or sister from church he talks bad about her and this is what we call girls cheese man foreign stuff that's not even true guess what I heard that when sister Teresa raises her hands up in the air in church that she's not actually praising God for reals nah yeah for reals and which is Prince she's not actually doing it with her heart like for reals I'm just telling you the truth I can't wait to tell my friends that's good that's good I just I don't want you to end up like her okay so you're gonna go okay just try not to be like her now brother Pierre doesn't understand why he's doing this why is he talking bad about the sister why is his life like this but the truth is he actually does know why you know what it is is he doesn't want to surrender his life to God because he's scared he's scared that he won't be able to please God perfectly he's scared that he's gonna fail again just like the devil has been reminding him now later on sister Teresa notices that her brother is struggling and decides that she's gonna offer help the Holy Spirit talked to her to do this you know Hey Brother fear of noticing you've no you can go back to your home I don't need any help you could do your business I can do mine okay just like he's always been struggling with brother peers Pride took over him and made him think that the sister was trying to make him look little and embarrass him so he rejected any helping hand that came his way but later on during that night he started realizing that he couldn't do this on his own anymore that he really wasn't strong enough and that he truly needed God so then while crying out to God he decides to call sister Teresa in hopes that she still felt compassion towards him [Music] Just Dance the devil's trying to work his way right now hello hello brother here hello says Theresa how do you feel well I'm okay I guess actually no I'm not doing so well what's wrong would you like to talk about it I just wanted to say sorry for speaking so harsh to you earlier oh no it's okay don't worry about it I understand no you don't I've been so jealous of you and I and as well that you you just have a perfect life and last time we talk that felt humiliated and also when last time we talked it was also like I felt like you were trying to make me feel small and well your life is just so perfect and I wish that I could have the life but I don't oh brother don't think that way I have bad times and struggles too I'm fighting every minute I can understand why you're why you get discouraged we ourselves are our worst enemy you know really I never knew that I thought the devil was our only enemy do you believe you're a child of God um well sometimes I don't feel like one and most of the times I don't think I am one brother it's not about feelings it's about believing do you have faith your sister there you go that's all you need don't let the double trick you into staying as a prisoner to this flesh don't fall into your negative thoughts you choose sister Teresa yes this mine is where the greatest battle has ever fought you need to constantly be letting go of ourselves and our flesh so God can take over we can't do it in our um you choose it's Teresa may I ask you something sure can you come over to my house and and pray for me so that I may so that it may be delivered from this selfish desire sure so then after the phone call sister Teresa gave him words of life and so they got together and prayed that night brother Pierre finally decided to surrender to God and he was finally delivered with the help of God he was able to let go of all of his selfish Ambitions desires and give back what the devil had given him all of those lies and gods brother Pierre was now fully surrendered to God and he had number one in his life as God further Pierre was a prisoner and so was sister Teresa you guys get it now [Music] so yes good hey man which is foreign [Music] [Music]
