I like to call this uh preaching he will call and I will answer this is uno John 10 verse 1 says foreign of the Sheep and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leaded them out and when he puteth forth his own sheep he goes before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers estates this purple spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spoken to them then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep you may be Cedar brother I'm gonna go very slowly yes Sunday school Sunday morning there's no need to shout to run but I bring a thought with me pastor says a man without a pastor will not be in the resurrection and the reference of the references I have with what I be speaking is in the message the Good Shepherd of the sheep my brother Branham preached 1957. the Sumerian Church age preach 1960 Jesus Take insights with Jesus 1962. in 1964 why it had to be Shepherds and the message why it had to be Shepherds brother Branham begins to describe what a Shepherd is Pastor in English but the word Shepherd in English is a compound word the first is sheep that means a sheep and her that means heard Shepherds is they have Fellowship so much with their sheep that they get to smell like sheep and sometimes they even laugh like sheep Italian so be sacrificed there he says Isaiah 53 verse 6 he said all we like sheep have gone astray todos all so we all count ourselves in there everyone turned away from his own way everyone got their own ideas everyone walked according to what they thought was the best for them but even there this is and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all and he starts to say why did he appear to Shepherds why did he not appear to the theologians peoples Scholars from back then esperando those that were expecting him yes and he says because they had added their way of thinking to how they believed that he would come see any man could have thought of it and he came in the form of a lamb the first he would have done foreign and he says watch the prophets how they dress from sheepskins watch Moses a prophet and Shepherd or pasture because that was his calling this Brandon says why Shepherds dress with sheepskins foreign will come to remove the sin of the world pero cuando Senor Jesus Christ for when the Lord Jesus Christ came he came in a very humble way to the theologians of that time they over saw that people that were fishermen humble people amen amen Oda now we should understand one thing okay Jesus Christ has an army army our ranks there are positions but all of these positions inside a church should respond or answer to a pastor porque is in the message the Good Shepherd of the Sheep this is if the barrier puts you underground and dig six feet under you foreign a stranger though not follow and though says so there's a condescendence in this co-descendants we have the Lord Jesus Christ primeramente first of all and Don says and then the messenger is next yesterday pastor and this messenger is a prophet Pastor yes gives his message again to whom to theologians alos pastores to the pastors or Shepherds yes those pastores and these Shepherds and dragon give their message to the Sheep that's that's how it goes look a pastor and follow me so bring you back in the difference between us and this because when we see the drug addict we criticize him we see the prostitute criticize her when someone goes astray we talk about it we criticize like one of his flock so when Jesus Christ is saying my sheep hear my voice hear my word yes this is what the shepherd Pastor speaks and recognize That's The Voice of Jesus Christ foreign directly foreign [Music] I see this and see you as simple as that we have to discuss something I said [Music] look in the message taking sides with Jesus paragraph 23 this is and he's trying to explain the order of the church it is now we're going to start off with the early church Iber strange down to what they did and then I can show you the vision that I have for the future the prophet is a vision he had for them he knew it was coming even after his death okay each one of these churches he left someone who was in order remember there's an order a man that was trustworthy a man that was known Pastor as a pastor Shepherd then after this church or then after this church then become other little churches come out of it young men and old men raised up and become churches out of them the man that was over the first church was called and then his that went out from him his children was called Shepherds or pastors a pastor and this is the jagara Serpa store before becoming a pastor El Diago first he is a sheep he said yes Isaiah 53. pastor Lolo Prophet Pastor is the pastor maestros or the report teachers the Evangelist everyone is in a congregation all the Ministries al pastor to the passage and after the pastor he said and there is if God has ever called you to be a pastor mere attending a church no no no oh because brother Titus is my pastor because I say that that has nothing to do let's see what the prophet says why did he choose pastors paragraph 224 you say is now we know every time that the crucified crisis accepted there's a new birth says there's a newborn sheep or Los Angeles there are songs in heaven for the Angels the Angels sing again they say um you say well I lived a good life so they're the apostles but it wasn't born again until they received the Holy Spirit it wasn't even converted until they received the Holy Spirit you remember the night before the Betrayal or on the Betrayal um Peter had followed him for three and a half years born again a pasture watch what I'm gonna tell you brethren become a sheep is the Lord's flock because there is no seed in here but if the holy spirit that was once in Jesus Christ your pastor and Don says I can receive the Holy Spirit [Music] amen amen amen God bless you [Applause] amen amen esta manana with a tremendous message we've heard respondere call and ask your answer is First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 21 says like this is for instance by a Man Came Death Resurrection de los Muertos my man came also the resurrection of the Dead through a man a death entered but also the resurrection of the dead has to come through a man verse 22. even so in Christ shall all be made alive one more scripture hope capitulo Job chapter 14. verse 14. Job 14 verse 14 says like this is if a man shall if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come palabra what a tremendous word we have read uh job was a man okay just as you and I am things had happened in his life he was a man that had experienced pain he had experienced Brokenness that's right there were many questions in the in jobs because job would see nature he would see the cycle of that nature oh you can see the trees when in the springtime they would Blossom or Bloom they would look so beautiful he saw how they flourished in that Springtime and in the summer they continue to be beautiful but then the fall would come in he would see how those leaves would begin to change colors begin to fall off the trees and then the winter Cameo it would dry up the winter would come in and how that tree appeared to be dead within the springtime would come around again and it appeared like that although it appeared it appeared like there was no life the life would come up again when he saw all those things only saw his condition he asked himself por que Lombre why man dies if a man dies shall he live again compare with nature jobs sitting there sitting there sick there's noodles his children had passed away his properties had been had been destroyed what reminded him curse your God and die how tremendous but God's plan is it's very tremendous because God likes a momentos take us through moments where we know that we can't depend on it and of the men that God has placed I'm going to read a quote this element brother Brown says when they say Hobe and Sumas Grande a job in his greatest English this morning uh job was our character Elke that when he was in the deepest of his distress when all of his riches have gone from him his children was dead his body was broken and he was in the greatest distress that he was ever in is how tremendous tremendous I think about death resurrection and I began to think on about how we speak on the resurrection I think about my life I I I Tres Casas you know there are three things that happened to us before we depart from this Earth you know there are three voices has to be quickened already all right when I think and Hope on job and seeing his condition and seeing how God works Como Dios how God worked in Abraham is God could have chose a young man and a young lady to say to themes out of you will come generation the great generation or a great uh descendancy but God chooses of things that seem to be impossible to demonstrated his own word his wife she was an elderly woman the time of our life had passed for her she was barren or she was dead and God wants to reflect his powers who wants to show that he is this morning I'm in attention hope Joe catches my attention brother Brandon says it was at that at the greatest hour foreign man acovertiso Como El cuarbon and Jolo recipe and to the Coal Shed where I received it God has a place and a purpose I want to tell you a place of time and a purpose there are occasions where we feel so separated death is also a separation from God but God has the time is when he had a job in this condition he had him on the sacred Sands algo where he was going to reveal something to him that would never go away don't you think God Brothers of conditions feel like we're worthy we feel like maybe this isn't foreign because we're not where we should be pero is but these words give me a give me uh they encouragement because it doesn't matter how low we are no important many times they will never forget a H Jesus out there hello he gets you on those places where there is no devil Hamas no devil can ever come the devil can't get there I'll tell you this morning hearing his words the devil has no luck or he has no luck there he said he says the resurrection is a revelation Brothers they say El levels he gives you something on those stands back there a model the experiencia set of experience that you'll never forget as long as ages roll on La Resurrection the resurrection is and Revelation comes through his word there's no other way Brothers it's not jumping personal revelation you have with God and as it's been said this morning Resurrection no Resurrection when I see the pastor many times of the fault the pastor since we were children and that's how we were how difficult it is you see Beyond the Veil remember is through a man things that you may perhaps not understand when I see the pastor I think I'm the one that gives them all those gray hairs official because how difficult it is to set aside those curtains but it's the way of God [Music] look Brothers a music I recall when I was at home with my wife and our pastor came to speak with us I have a certificate of a pastor as well but the truth is these brothers that we were dead and the word the words there's no way that you can bring life it has to be through the body Brothers [Music] it's through the pastor here already nothing began to bring life that's the only way it comes down it tells us come out of this place you better start liking them because there's no other way things the purpose so let's start getting along the resurrection Brothers it's not about me foreign can you they shall be there as well transformation of the body Hermano foreign the coming of the Lord is the resurrection of the Dead is what is the problems [Applause] you are identified [Music] the problems come to us [Music] and the indifference is foreign we all have differences but I reconnaissance tells me yes it helps you bear with me sometimes we we fight or we fight yes Brothers but you know we love you don't understand I invite you this morning if you haven't had an experience like job tonight or this morning could be in the morning you can say Lord I want to make sure the right way good morning God bless you [Music] Hallelujah [Music] just made it to them [Music] again [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music]
