founders that that built this place God bless [Applause] you and we're happy to have him with us UMC uh The Book of Luke chapter 15 there's brother margarito and his daughter God bless him everyone is welcome says like this then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth Sinners and eateth with them he spoke unto them this par unto them saying what man of you having 100 sheep if he lose one of them does not leave the 90 and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when he had found it he layth it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he called it together his friend and neighbor saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over 90 and N just persons which need no repentance we'll be speaking with the thought the lost sheep let us pray Lord Jesus we want your guidance as we speak your word you working in every heart and give us what we need we ask this in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated I like the first verse of this chapter because it says says that all the the the publicans and sinners Drew near unto him to hear him generally the the publicans were looked at as evil people in in in in Israel and and the Sinners likewise but I like how the Bible says I love love how the Bible says I love how the Bible says that these publicans and these Sinners they sought out to hear the Lord Jesus Christ I ask myself how many Sinners want to be around us I ask how many people out there want to have fellowship with us do they want to hear us do they want to hear you could it be that we are so distanced many times so religious that the Sinners don't want to hear us because what we speak it distance them uh from us but with Jesus it was not so Sinners and the publicans wanted to hear Jesus on one occasion uh a man or a young person said that he came from a far off to hear the the Evangelist Dwight Moody it was when uh Moody would give Sunday schools and they asked him why do you go so far for a Sunday School when you have a closer church here why do you travel so far he said I go to hear a moody because there they love people like me that's what the Lord Jesus Christ had he had something that would catch their attention not only of those that had 20 years in the or 20 years in church but he drew the attention of the simple people of the sinful of the people that were headed down path they wanted they wanted to hear Jesus because they knew because they were loved there they they they were wanted there perhaps they wouldn't go to the synagogue or perhaps not even to the Temple but they knew that Jesus they knew that Jesus loved them Jesus was interested for them wanted to help them that's why I love that verse they drew near to Jesus all the publicans and sinners to hear him nobody forced them nobody had to tell them go ahead and go they desired to hear the Lord Jesus Christ but verse two says and the Pharisees we know that the Pharisees were the great religious people that day those that had been in the message for so many years but had not learned to love the Sinners they had not learned how to love the lost sheep and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man receive this man receiveth Sinners and he eateth with them oh Brothers I ask myself if we're not like that we don't say what's that brother doing with that person doing with that person does he not know what that he's he's he's wrong why does he hang out with them I ask myself if we don't make that kind of criticism many times we don't say well why hang out with that person he's he's in the wrong path he he is he is completely he's doing many bad things why do they hang out with them they are the worst that's what the Pharisees would murmur so Jesus wanted to teach them a lesson these to these Pharisees and us as well that we would be interested for the sinners for the people that that are astray for the people that are in sin and he gives them three Parables he gives to them one after the other Parables three Parable to teach them first he speaks to them on the lost sheep then he speaks to them on the Lost a coin of a woman that had 10 coins on her headband it was it was like an engagement ring for the woman and it says that she lost one and she turned the light she turned on the candle and she she looked for it until she found it then gives him the story of the prodal son yes the prodical son he gives him three stories the lost sheep the the Lost coin and then the prodical son lost yes the lost son and he teaches them through this stor these stories there is something special about someone that is lost and should receive special treatment and that will produce a special Joy I ask myself if there's not any Joy amongst us because we don't know what it's like what it's like to help someone that's lost that's if there's not any Joy among us we only focused on ourselves and not focus helping somebody somebody that is somebody that is a straight or lost there is a joy in Salvation there is a joy in Salvation it doesn't have to be NE you can Rejoice for the Salvation of your brother of your sister Son Of The Lost of The Sinner of the most evil person that's what because the three stories end with a with a par with a feast and joy now we'll speak a little bit on what it is to be lost I'm being lost what does it mean to be lost being lost it means that you are out of place you are out of your position or you don't know where you find yourself and don't know where to go what a terrible thing it is to be lost what a terrible thing it feels like to not go know where to go when you're out of your place out of where you belong the children of God they belong to God's family the of God Belong With God a sheep belongs with a sheep belongs with her she a sheep belongs with her [Applause] flock coin belongs to the headband belong on the ground lost it should be on the headband being in display for what it is for what it was made for I ask you brother and sister what were you made for are you in your place you could be in church and be lost be in church and be lost you are not in your position you're not where you should [Applause] be how sad it is to be lost we speak a lot on Psalms 23 he says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want how beautiful it is to know that we have a shepherd how many here have a shepherd He make me lie to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leaded me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou are with me th Ro and th staff they Comfort Me Now prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies th unes my head with oil my cup runneth over that is when you have a that is when you're being guided or that is when you are in your place that is when you are not lost but what about when you are lost now we love to speak on Psalms 23 say oh the Lord is my sheer I shall not want but what happens when that sheep is lost what happens when it's not with his Shepherd what happens when it's not being guided or LED how sad how scary to say yet though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death when I walk I walk through the your shadow of death I have no one to help me I don't have the comfort that I need could you imagine a sheep alone going through the valley of the shadow of death could you imagine her simply being lost the she not knowing what to do they she can't say he will Comfort my soul he will guide me through the path because there's no one guiding she's lost her guide the Sheep has lost her Direction has lost her family has lost the Comfort the Sheep can't say he'll Comfort my my soul what about when you're going through that moment the worst moment of their life the lowest of valleys of their life the lowest the most profound pain the greatest attack of the enemy and the shepherd isn't there oh let me tell you one occasion Jesus had to know what that felt like but it was like to walk alone the Bible says that inane sweat drops of blood to feel he began to get anxious because his father was going to separate from him for a moment he was going to go have to go through that Valley as a man not as God but as a man he going to have to go through that Valley the father having left his great Shepherd and him on the cross he he he he cried out he said father father why hast Thou forsaken me how sad it is to see a lost sheep the Sheep can't say you will prepare my table the table before me because perhaps the Sheep doesn't know what to eat the Sheep doesn't know where the food is the Sheep doesn't know what to feed of someone something could poison it something could make it sick now I don't want to be a a lost sheep I don't want to be someone that's lost I don't know about you brother but I want somebody to guide me I don't want to be and the circumstances of his life through the problems through the difficulties the enemy is real Sin is real hell is real the danger is real the wolf is real the Predator is real the Bible says the devil is as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he is real the devil is real I don't want to be alone I want a guide I want the holy ghost in my heart guiding my life because without him I'm lost without him I'm lost if the Holy Ghost is not guiding your life there is no Shepherd [Applause] there Jesus Christ said I will give you the Holy Ghost and he will guide you into all trth that's what we need Brothers to make sure we have someone guid Our Lives should be the presence of Person of the Holy Ghost are you being guided or are you one of the lost sheep who's guiding your life first Peter says first Peter 2 ver2 says for you were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and Bishop of your souls I make than you the invitation to each and every one of you that you would return to the sheer Bishop of your souls that you would allow God to guide your life now I ask myself why was the Sheep lost what caused it to be lost why did it stay now God gives three examples Jesus gives him three examples first one was of the lost sheep the second one was the Lost coin and the third one was the lost son one was lost because of of being through being foolish the the Sheep perhaps the the the coin was lost through carelessness and the third one the lost son was lost willfully he rebelled that's why in the first two Parables that you seek that which was lost but when someone goes willfully the father is waiting for him to return but why was he lost I could think of many reasons why a person is lost someone could get sick and they simply can't Advance something's happening with them someone could be attacked a sheep could be attacked we are attacked if we are not careful we will be uh bitten by Satan perhaps the people out there that have been attacked maybe even the Christians have attacked maybe even the Pharisees have attacked them sometimes the worst attacks come from within people that say they're Christian but just simply like to attack it somehow it makes them feel better that others are in a worse condition maybe that helps them not see their flaws when they see the laws of others it could have been that that sheep was attacked it could have been that simply she was careless simply didn't pay attention they say Charles spon said evangelist Charles Spurgeon he said when a sheep is is bleeding ble bleeds yes he says they they lose uh their food because she can't eat and and and and and bleed at the same time many because of so much complaining many times we don't realize that we're losing we're losing God's bless we're losing what he wants to give us we're the food for our lives and we become weak we're not eating because we are complaining we are crying can't bleed and eat at the same time or she bleeds or eats we are many that's why we many we because instead of eating we are bleeding we are crying we're complaining we're criticizing we're losing our lives our food we become careless become careless with about what God wants to give us perhaps we stumble many people get lost in in the mountains and places like that it's because they haven't they didn't look where they were stepping they didn't watch where they were stepping and they stumbled and they became hurt and they got lost because they fell too far out people are looking for them because they're wounded in a certain place and they fell and how dangerous and scary it it ought to be or it is because when something is lost you have no Assurance of being able to find it again it could be possible that it could be lost forever that you've lost and you've never been able to find again you remember I never found that certain thing again do you know where it ended up to know what happened with it I remember I left it here the other day I was looking for a title of vehicle that I have that I just uh gave away and I can't find it I looked all over I thought it was in a certain place and I can't find it if something is lost there's no assurance that you're going to be able to find it again are you with me brothers that's scary someone is lost there's no guarantee could be there and it died there nobody will find it that's scary but I like what brother brandham says here in uh letting off the pressure he says there are two types of people in this days let me say this men and women in the world today brother that really don't want to do these things they're doing there are men in the and women in the world today that don't want to sin I feel sorry for them they don't want to do anything wrong but they do it drove to it there's a place for that person that wants to do right there's a place to let off that pressure it's true but there are some that don't care not all Sinners wants to continue s not all the one that's backsliding wants to be back majority of are trying to find their way back majority of don't want to be in that place brother how many could say Amen to that how many could say I've sinned I have not wanted I have failed I haven't wanted to fail no wonder it's so important to Jesus there is a special treatment brother says he leaves the 99 with the other Shepherds that are helping him he go and seeks that one which was lost because perhaps it didn't want to be lost perhaps that wasn't his desire perhaps the devil perhaps deceived it and he gives a more special treatment a more special attention to the one that is lost than to the soul is lost then to the other 99 that are with the myself do we have the same desire that Jesus do we have that same desire to seek that lost soul to to seek that person that's not Desiring to live the way they're living some sick out there someone lost out there to take them as your responsibility Jesus tells this to the Pharisees just which one of us in other words you take the responsibility a lost phone than a lost soul when you know there's somebody in need why don't you worry for them why don't you take that responsibility why you say if it matters to God should matter to me brother Bram says in the message images of Christ he says if I had a a a a a lesson to give I want to be like he was he came to be a shepherd and he was a shepher sheer someone that goes to seek their sheep you don't have to have the office of a pastor but you have to have the office of a Shepherd you don't have to have the office of a Shepherd but you can have the heart of a Shepherd even go the Lord tells Peter if Peter if you love me if you love me what if Jesus would have would ask you that if you love me if you love me Tabernacle voice do you love God you love the Lord Jesus then care for my sheep take care of my sheep take care of my children brother says I would rather have someone do good to my children then do it to me that's how our heavenly father is Father you have you do it for them then to do it for me brother BR continue saying there's a famous picture I don't know if it's here I don't think but I have it in the room and I always look at it I can't remember of the a painter's name but when he seeks that black that he loses it and seeks it out and goes and seeks it what is he doing he goes through the Wilderness he's also scratched up he goes through dangers he seeks all night until finally at at the end of a of a of a cliff there hanging off a bush seeking his own life he reaches out brings that little animal out of its condition and he brings it to himself this say he says another another paint or artist paint painted a painting if it's not there I probably missed it to send it to you again say another uh another painter painted a painting of The Shepherd bringing the Sheep back it appears that the easiest thing would be for the shepherd to put that sheep around the the and walk it back this way but do you see how how the spirit took hold of of the the brush of the the AR the pain he didn't put it under his arm he put it upon his shoulders that's what the Book of Luke says he takes it upon his shoulders now I want you to look see the care of this Shepherd Jesus when he was casting out demons he said he did it with the Finger of God that's all Jesus needed to cast out demons was one finger I imagine he used the weakest of fingers to cast out demons it was one finger he said if a demon is bothering you all you need on behalf of God is something so insignificant but for him to just lift up his and cast him out but when it has to do with a sheep coming back home it has to do with the Sheep coming back home what is the strongest part of a man it's his shoulders have you [Applause] noticed how the shoulders are the the the biggest thing of of a man where can he carry the most weight it's on his shoulders and what is the most sure thing for for the be upon his shoulders and that's how he took that sheep put it upon his shoulders and lovingly walks back with it then brother says oh Brothers here he is all the powers of God give God a round of applause how much he loves us how much he loves [Music] us how much he loves us all the powers of God no wonder we don't see all God's power because we're not in in the same thoughts to say God I come to this life to seek lost souls that's part of our commission yes or yes brother the commission that God gave his Apostles part of our commission go around world to Every Creature believe that is baptized shall be saved that's commission for who for who Brothers for for who not for all of them for who it's for me don't put it on everybody else put it for yourself that's my [Applause] commission say it's my commission half of half of it believe it thank God for somebody that believes that I know somebody believes that's our commission that's my commission that's why although I preach hard many times as a shepher I could to church but it's never been taken from seek someone in need and tell them there's salvation for you there's forgiveness for you there is help for you there is love for you because it's my commission it's your commission it's our commission he says all the powers of God clothing that lost thing bringing her back you say Lord why don't I see more of you I don't see I see more of your power I don't see more why don't I see more of your Miracles could it be that we it doesn't matter to us that lost sheep doesn't matter to us could it be that when he displays the most powerful thing him you don't see it when you cast you see a preacher you see Minister for for a sick person that's just only need the finger of God's only need that's all that's needed to cast out sickness to cast out demon all that's needed is is let me tell you is there more of God more of God more of God Brothers there's more power there's more power of God he would only show it when he is carrying a lost sheep all the powers of heaven will will support you you are seeking a lost sheep musicians can't come forward John Wesley a general told John Wesley on one occasion I never forgive anyone this was a general that was speaking he told John Wesley I never forgive there's some of us like that here not forgive anybody John Wesley John Wesley said then sir I hope you never sin because you will not be forgiven but when you know what forgiveness is when you know you've been a sheep that's how many has been a back everyone has gone his own way when you know what it's like to be lost when the Devil comes and tells you there's no forgiveness for you you've crossed that line of Mercy when the Devil comes and tells you look look at how far astray you've gone am I the only one brothers that has gone through [Music] that the devil just points at all your [Music] flaws he says look nobody loves you look at how how alone you are and how much of a sinner you are and how much you [Music] fail when you know what it feels [Music] like to desire God's forgiveness to beg for God's forgiveness to say God I didn't want to do it this isn't what I [Music] wanted when you [Music] know how of that profound pain say Lord I don't know if the God would forgive me I don't know if he'll receive me again when you know that pain [Music] you offer that love to others you tell them there is forgiveness for you there's life for [Music] you perhaps you've you've gone astray someone hurt you the devil attacked you and life has been cruel to you but the she wants you back he wants to guide your life he wants you back [Music] again let me tell you there's not a Greater Joy there's not a joy as [Music] great like seeing lost sheep that's the joy that the Lord is is is speaking of [Music] here and I will tell you as we're ending the year and we're finishing up with this [Music] theme speaking of our purpose on this Earth Jesus is still saving souls and there are still Sinners that want to come to [Music] him there are sinners that need to hear [Music] him if there's one thing we want to do on this [Music] Earth is to reflect the love of our Shepherd and tell them God loves you God can help you there's love for you there's a place of Refuge for you he awaits you because many times we've been like the prodical son ourselves have rebelled against God no one did anything to us but we didn't no longer wanted [Music] to follow what he was asking of us that doesn't mean that he's forgotten us but he continues waiting for us no I was learning something about that [Music] story the reason the father ran to the son when he came back he ran to embrace [Applause] him not only because he was excited to see him but the Bible says that when a son has been disobedient when he's been the book of Deuteronomy says people have a right to Stone him when he goes when he's coming back so it's very possible that the father to protect to cover him in case someone wanted to Stone him he went and clothed and protected him protected him and to get to the son they had to get through the father that's what he does for us that's what he does for you he comes and he protects he tells the devil he can't do anything to you we're going to be having some baptisms and I [Music] invite you if if if you have been a someone that's gone astray if you find yourself lost you don't know what your position is if you're not being led by the spirit of God he is seeking you he offers you the opportunity to go and have a Shepherd to be able to say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not [Music] want he make me lie down the Green Pastures he Comforts my soul he will lead me through the path of righteousness though I walk through the valley is the shadow of [Music] death you want someone with you in your most difficult moments if you want someone to guide you someone to protect you you want someone to care want someone to feed you you want someone to comfort [Music] you come to him he offers those things please [Music] stand I just want to share [Music] this I've gotten lost many [Music] times I've been careless with God many [Music] times sometimes I've allowed the pain to enter my life and take away my [Music] joy take away the vision of Heaven this [Music] morning I want to say God help me help us cuz time after time you have found me you've brought me back you've protected me with your shoulders you brought me back with great love and [Music] mercy perhaps there's someone there that finds themselves in that condition like I have found myself many times when I say Lord I no longer know what to do I don't know how where to go I know I don't know what decision to take but Lord you find when I can't find you find me me Lord when I can't walk any longer take me in your [Music] arms when I can't see I want you to be my [Music] guide I provide and you are [Music] B than enough

amen amen hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah Gabby who's going to be baptized she has felt in her heart to take this leap of faith the Bible says if we believe and we were to be baptized we shall be saved because in our heart we believe and we confess with our mouth that Jesus Christ can save us and we come to the baptism and testify with everyone that our lives we give our life to God we know our sins are forgiven has nothing against us the blood of the Lamb forgotten the Bible says God for God forgets our failures and he helps us what we have coming forth so if there's someone else
