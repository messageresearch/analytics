[Music] [Music] hey Jose primero service [Music] Gloria Dios is a pleasure to be here in this place there's not a better place to be Cristo the house of the Lord Jesus Christ and now he's in his children verse 6. when you have it you could say Amen is monitor you just put it up here already together de dios entonces respondsiendo esta is saying this is the word of the Lord unto cerebral bell saying now by might nor by power but by my spirits that the Lord of hosts have laid the foundation of his house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts shall has sent me unto you the reading of his word you may be seated you see here that the hands of Sarah Babel were to lay the foundations they would know that the Lord of hosts had sent him so we see here Brothers it was the hands of zerube he was going to do a work question it was an effort I was going to be going to take to construct to build it in our time foreign Pueblo so look when I win expectations I wasn't going with Greg I would hear our passes foreign and it doesn't matter how many times and he won't be able to because foreign Hallelujah [Applause] foreign because it belongs to God [Music] correct me if I'm wrong he will speak on the Beatitudes he though a multitude of people okay your words this morning but look Brothers foreign hum look Brothers I didn't say the title again priorities priorities in our lives the reason why I didn't say it is but there are priorities we have priorities and we go like the like the dead like the Dead Sea one gets into the sea you just float you don't have to uh you don't is make you float I explained myself do you understand you understand me what I'm trying to tell you is very soon [Music] that's the way it was created is you can receive it or find it my question is how do we find our spiritual lives it doesn't go very well the only one that goes through things these are fundamental things he should be our priority glory to God what happens is priorities aren't according to the word of God that's why we feel like we're dying many times but look Brothers a um I humbly say this is how it was built please God to be there we know who built the first Tabernacle it was it was the temples the Solomon salomonos destroyed by Babylonia by the people of Babylon he is that's what the devil does he wants to destroy this Temple is that's what the devil's been trying to do is destroy this Temple the one would get filthy is it begins one begins to destroy yourself because we allow not just anything I chose your priorities Nintendo yes because we have to Die daily what he did because their priorities so many things that's normal remember children of God in the last days [Applause] he wants to be our best friend orita I was honestly speaking right now you have a friend on what he knows and how he directs it is one wants to have that contact recognition who wants to have a dumb friend who doesn't know anything nobody I mean it's difficile it's difficult but people want to have friendships somebody that knows a lot and the devil knows a lot but at the same time he doesn't know anything he knows a lot yeah he doesn't know anything foreign God bless you uh chapter 1 verse 3 says like this then came the word of the Lord by Haggard The Prophet saying Tiempo para vosotros de avitar embuestras Casas artesonadas is it time for you or you to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste uh I like how the New Living Translation States it you say s vien OS this is another for us that the Lord of hosts consider your ways is you have so much in bringing little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you are not filled with drink you clothe you but there is none warm and he that Earnest wages earns wages to put it into a bag with holes terrible picture we just read does that the Lord consider your ways I want to read one more scripture apocalypse is Revelations 19 verse 7. Gloria Las bodas Del Cordero is let us be glad and rejoiced and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready I'd like to begin by asking you guess importante cuando estamos en Los ultimos Diaz what is important when we're in the last days we lived as if he comes tomorrow what would I change what would matter in our in your lives we knew Jesus was coming tomorrow what value would your belongings have what priorities they be the same if you knew Jesus was coming tomorrow be worth the same tomorrow if you knew Jesus was coming things that we fight and defend ERS you stand for those same things if you knew Jesus was coming tomorrow we ought to be living as if Jesus died yesterday Rose this morning coming back this afternoon [Music] it is rebuking the people of Israel and it's because their mentality their focus and priorities edifying or building a luxurious house with himself and it was deserted in other words to the priorities of God the people of Israel for this time what God wanted them to do it was totally different what is the priority is what we will do first our time money and efforts those are our priorities I'll tell you where you your priorities are man that's correct come on guys says thus said the Lord meditate upon your ways to analyze where our ways are my name you know the word stop what you're doing much but we're not bringing anything good it means it means you're doing God's will is working on their own things [Applause] he wasn't what God wanted that you're in the perfect will of God you could be blessed and have Allah Jeremiah chapter 6 verses in the ways oh wait yeah where our priorities are immediately for the for the the old ways that's what I like the most is tremendous and you shall find Descanso rest for your souls a person that is countries [Applause] that God is with them we will not walk therein which is many times the reasons there's no rest in our lives because we're not doing it because we're we're doing what really has no value and it could benefit our own lives we don't find peace because there's there's no there's no reward or value Galatians 6 verse 8 says foreign Everlasting yes for ourselves but you think that what you're investing in is that will last in your life wow I want to tell you that the benefits for this world say that again benefits [Music] come on Richard s now when you talk about priorities the Christian is no different than the unbelievers they both have priorities it's impossible to live without having priorities and because of that decisions are taken a person that has according to their priorities third place it's not wrong Brothers to invest in things but we're talking about priorities my priority means first what's the third place in your life was forsaken um the whole world has to make decisions in the way that the impact he wants to be here [Applause] I know he's first now remember may not be the importance that you give it and you could care less about it it goes on the basis of what your priorities are Israel in this trip to Israel is very costly how do you create money out of nothing I just all I need to do is ready and go to Israel it was something I wanted to do Marcos Mark chapter 10. you know it is loved him speaking of the richest foreign in this place they're two vastly different things Luke chapter 2 verse 49. and he said unto them I like how Jesus had very had defined his priorities he knew why he had come to this earth watch what Jesus Jesus is speaking at the 12 years of age that I must be about my father's business this Earth priorities but they did not understand um which he's taken to them a person has priorities in their lives many people will not understand don't have your priorities they won't understand you attitude not be understood simply because your priorities because we are priorities you want to lay up Treasures in Heaven I already said the rest of the people everything will be added on to you this trip to Israel I learned a lot I was able to see where Jesus walked whatever I was able to see where UMES in the mountains in the isolated places one thing that stood out to me is how a people listen how a people is awaiting their Messiah they are prepared they pray three times a day implementations three times a week Eagles everything is ready and they don't have a temple yet and they are prepared and for people there's a way in there can be prepared much more us questions [Applause] have our priorities in order they know the people Revelations of the true church and what she is she stands foreign [Applause] foreign to be him yeah brother Branham says you see safe made herself ready this evil spirit for me I'm drinking gambling or from Life I'll
