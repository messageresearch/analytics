[24:06] of the king's meat
[24:08] and of the wine which he drank

[24:57] this know also
[24:58] that in the last days perilous times
[25:00] shall come
[25:06] says for men shall be lovers of their
[25:08] own selves

[25:36] it says without natural affection truth
[25:38] breakers false accusers incontent fears
[25:41] despisers of those that are good
[25:43] and it says
[25:45] traitors
[25:46] heady high-minded
[25:48] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[25:50] god
[25:51] cinco de so
[26:07] having a form of godliness but denying
[26:09] the power thereof
[26:15] let us pray
[26:16] heavenly father celestial we're so
[26:19] grateful this morning
[26:21] for the privilege you give us to be in
[26:23] your presence
[26:27] we have full assurance that you're here
[26:28] with us
[26:32] because your word has told us so
[26:36] we asked father
[26:38] that you would just speak to your
[26:39] children
[26:41] they're your children that are hungry
[26:47] for words of life
[26:50] we ask that you uh use the interpreter
[26:54] use the one that we'll be speaking for
[26:57] and then at the end of the service
[27:00] we just uh we just want your holy name
[27:02] to be glorified
[27:05] and we put ourselves in your hands
[27:08] and we ask this in the name of our lord
[27:10] jesus christ
[27:12] amen amen uh you may be seated
[27:15] uh it's been about a month
[27:18] you know
[27:26] there's god's just been you know working
[27:28] this morning
[27:31] i get i get pretty excited
[27:34] you know one thing i've learned
[27:37] you know ever since i understand
[27:39] i've understood my colleagues
[27:42] you know uh i just i just want to be
[27:44] faithful in it
[27:46] if
[27:59] in other things
[28:13] you know we set aside the things of god
[28:17] you know but i don't want to be like
[28:18] that unfaithful story
[28:23] the unfaithful steward of
[28:25] el mayor domo in field i want
[28:29] i don't want to be like that
[28:31] even if it's something just it's very
[28:33] simple
[28:35] and it may seem insignificant
[28:38] significant but i want to let you know
[28:41] that that that small thing
[28:44] that may seem insignificant to others
[28:48] it's not insignificant to god
[28:50] you can't tell yourself you see god sees
[28:52] all things
[28:54] big and small
[28:56] you know
[29:38] you know i heard i heard a quote i heard
[29:39] a quote one time
[29:43] i i was i was very big on sports growing
[29:45] up
[29:47] if i could identify myself with somebody
[29:50] it would probably be uh like samuel said
[30:08] you know one of the things that always
[30:10] caught my attention
[30:16] oh you know things that would motivate
[30:18] my motiva and uh one of the quotes i
[30:21] remember very well
[30:25] it said this
[30:26] it said a pressure
[30:30] it bust pipes it'll bust pipes
[30:35] or
[30:36] or
[30:37] it will make diamonds
[30:41] you know and i don't know about you
[30:44] but uh i want to be more than just a
[30:46] pipe quiero said
[30:47] una pipa you know i i i want to be more
[30:50] than just than just a pipe
[30:53] you see because i believe that god has
[30:55] diamonds
[30:57] i believe and you know to to to uh to be
[31:00] a diamond
[31:02] there has to be a pressure that has to
[31:04] be applied
[31:06] applicable amen amen and you see uh when
[31:09] uh when daniel and and uh you know these
[31:11] hebrew children
[31:15] the people of israel they were taking
[31:16] captives
[31:26] it almost seemed like god was just
[31:27] sleeping on them
[31:30] they almost sleep like they were serving
[31:31] a god that was sleeping
[31:35] i wonder if we don't ask ourselves that
[31:37] question many times
[31:41] if there's a god
[31:43] if there's a god
[31:58] maybe god isn't sleepy
[32:01] you see maybe god has been talking
[32:05] i wonder if we're not sleeping on him
[32:08] i wonder if we haven't slept when he's
[32:10] been trying to speak
[32:26] you know but you just haven't been away
[32:28] to here
[32:30] i believe god has been speaking
[32:33] and he's been speaking
[32:35] you see we got a god of mercy
[32:38] but there is a lie
[32:54] he is waiting
[33:05] brothers
[33:21] god was sleeping on him
[33:38] and it reads like this
[33:41] if there's anything that makes
[33:42] christians lazy
[33:46] it says it's when they're on a flower
[33:48] bed of ease esco understands
[34:02] he says always the chain is the
[34:04] strongest at its weakest links
[34:09] and i like what he says here
[34:12] he says and a man under pressure
[34:16] is what he is when he's under pressure
[34:32] it says get him all riled
[34:35] up
[34:37] then you'll see the real man that comes
[34:39] out
[34:39] [Music]
[34:42] if he's got temper
[34:44] it'll show itself
[35:14] he was putting them
[35:28] it was
[35:34] [Applause]
[35:42] ever since
[35:52] i knew there was something more than
[35:54] just what the world had to offer
[36:10] it's never
[36:25] but there is a god
[36:27] that has no limits
[36:30] he is going to take me out
[36:33] but before he takes me out but i'll just
[36:35] get my socket he has got to put me
[36:37] through
[37:06] you know i think it was a year back okay
[37:11] my life my wife
[37:14] she lost her ring
[37:17] and uh
[37:19] you know i heard about it yeah exclu
[37:22] chad

[37:32] uh
[37:34] but
[37:36] we looked for it and we couldn't find it
[37:40] you know we looked for it in the daytime
[37:42] you know we're trying she was trying to
[37:44] go back and see yes
[37:48] you know trying to trace her steps
[37:52] and you know what when the last time she
[37:54] saw it
[37:57] and uh
[37:58] she came to check at the church you know
[38:00] in the parking lot and everything
[38:04] and we know i was like man you know it's
[38:07] gone
[38:11] and
[38:12] i was like well you know we could check
[38:14] again
[38:30] you know but i looked underneath
[38:33] you know and i was like man you know if
[38:35] we're going to find it
[38:38] we're going to find this diamond this
[38:39] diamond rings
[38:43] we're going to find it at night
[38:46] it's hard to find that you know
[38:47] something that shines you know when when
[38:48] the when the sun's beaming
[38:54] if we're going to find it we're going to
[38:55] find it right now
[38:58] you know so i get a light
[39:26] going to find it you know when it's the
[39:28] darkest almost
[39:30] you see we live in a place you know
[39:31] there's a lot of homeless people
[39:35] you know they're just they're just
[39:37] walking around here i mean you guys have
[39:38] seen it
[39:53] you know we're living in the last days
[40:06] you see we got pressure from our bosses
[40:35] and we have to be able to resist this
[40:38] pressure pod
[40:40] amen amen we got to be able to resist it
[40:45] we got to be able to hold our grounds
[40:48] you see when daniel and
[40:50] the hebrew
[41:19] they didn't teach them what that they
[41:20] were taught when they were younger one
[41:22] more time they weren't they weren't
[41:23] taught what they were taught when they
[41:24] were younger
[41:28] they didn't eat the same
[41:30] comment
[41:31] you see they weren't taught the same
[41:33] segment
[41:34] they they didn't want him to live the
[41:36] same okay
[41:37] why you see everything was so different
[41:40] he was taking him to a place that they
[41:42] they didn't know what was happening
[41:46] but you know i was thinking
[41:48] why would god allow this
[41:52] brought me way back
[41:55] it took me back to the beginning
[41:58] you know even before there was an
[42:00] earthquake
[42:14] you see because even before there was a
[42:16] guardian
[42:20] satan satan
[42:22] was allowed
[42:24] to deceive the engagement in heaven and
[42:28] el cielo
[42:42] he deceived
[43:02] i think that's the only time you know
[43:04] that a butt is is actually valid
[43:24] i had to do something about it
[43:27] and he allows
[43:29] the the people of israel
[43:32] but to be taken into a very dark place
[43:35] a place that was far from perfect
[43:51] babylon
[44:20] that
[45:02] that
[45:29] god
[45:40] [Music]
[45:44] i want to go to uh
[45:48] daniel chapter 1 verse 5 again
[45:53] and uh
[45:56] i just want to read that one more time
[45:58] no mas la lo
[46:14] i want to just hold it right there
[46:17] you know what brother branham says
[46:20] and the message is the fourth seal
[46:23] he says this be said
[46:26] he says now the power of revelation
[46:32] brings stimulation to the believer
[46:36] it says for the power of wine
[46:40] natural wine
[46:56] you know we act like you know we we just
[46:59] it seems when people see us you know
[47:01] depressed
[47:03] and you know we're just slouched down
[47:05] and yeah
[47:07] they would say we're christian yeah
[47:49] you need god to wake you up this is
[47:51] against like you've been sleeping for
[47:53] too long
[47:54] you need to get stimulated
[47:57] you need a revelation
[47:59] that'll cause the stimulation
[48:02] that'll bring you up
[48:04] there and you start
[48:33] it's the action of a rousing interest
[48:38] enthusiasm enthusiasm or excitement
[48:42] or emotion i wonder if we have
[48:46] stimulation
[48:58] we want to be stimulated
[49:14] my wine escomo tomen
[49:17] i'll take some of this stuff
[49:19] i'll take some of what we eat
[49:22] some of the things that we do
[49:26] you don't have to be different
[49:27] [Music]
[49:38] oh this is what stimulates me
[49:41] this is what makes me excited
[49:55] i wonder if it doesn't not because if we
[49:59] if it does
[50:01] oh we need to get moving
[50:04] and we got to show it
[50:08] before we can live
[50:22] i don't care what's happening
[51:06] you know people get scared
[51:19] the son or daughter of god
[51:34] i'm going
[51:48] there are
[52:16] it was
[52:27] let's go back to the quote
[52:34] he said this
[52:36] esto
[52:38] now there's a power of the revelation of
[52:40] the word
[52:49] now there's the power of the revelation
[52:51] of the word
[52:52] that gives stimulation of joy to the
[52:54] believers
[53:12] it's called
[53:26] he says these are drunk on new wine
[53:32] or spiritual wine or spiritual i think
[53:35] the best interpretation
[53:39] would be on spiritual wine
[53:50] i'd like to drink some of that wine
[54:22] that's what
[54:36] because that's what he
[54:48] these hebrew children i'm gonna get into
[54:50] them
[55:02] amen amen
[55:06] they're offered of these wine
[55:10] sonos
[55:12] you know enough this meat
[55:17] that they you know would uh be partakers
[55:19] of it okay uh
[55:21] participate
[55:23] they would drink it
[55:26] you know and you know what what that's
[55:28] what the devil likes to do
[55:30] you see because they had already had the
[55:32] real wine
[55:35] that's right
[55:37] these peop these these the people of
[55:38] israel hello israel
[55:41] as they grew up
[55:43] you know these children which you know
[55:45] was uh daniel and then the hebrew
[55:47] children
[55:51] their parents taught him well
[55:54] you know and i believe that
[55:55] i believe that because of what they did
[55:59] because of the way that they handled
[56:01] themselves
[56:04] you know under this pressure
[56:07] you know brother alex
[56:09] alex he talked about you know the
[56:10] teaching
[56:12] because you know the the teaching of
[56:15] they they wanted them to be taught in
[56:17] another way
[56:20] they wanted them to forget about their
[56:22] language
[56:24] forget about that heaven stuff
[56:28] that's what they want that's a look at
[56:30] your skin don't forget about that they
[56:31] didn't say this
[56:35] yes
[56:37] the devil's trying to give you his point
[56:38] of view
[56:41] that's what he's trying to do he's
[56:44] trying to give you his point man this is
[56:46] this is real living
[56:47] csv
[56:48] that's that's temporary
[56:51] that that's the only temporary
[56:53] you see it'll fade out
[57:24] this is gonna make me happy for a little
[57:25] while okay
[57:29] i believe that we got it
[57:32] we have it right now
[57:33] and it's the moment oh you got it in
[57:35] your hands
[57:37] you know and if you got it in your hands
[58:36] you know they were pressured there was
[58:37] pressure to succeed
[58:40] you know to to to to have success
[58:44] you know that was pressure i believe
[58:46] there's pressure
[59:30] and honestly
[59:32] it it
[59:34] displeases them oh right
[59:36] it brings some displeasure
[59:42] this is displeasing
[1:00:12] we've
[1:01:09] and it'll it'll make you happier
[1:01:14] it'll bring real excitement
[1:01:18] it'll bring real joy
[1:01:22] you know but we know that's a lie but
[1:01:26] we know we've i've been there
[1:01:30] and you know what the reason i'm up here
[1:01:33] it's because uh you know there's some
[1:01:34] people following
[1:02:32] but it was an act of god
[1:02:35] you see god could stop the persecution
[1:02:39] he could stop the hardships
[1:02:43] he can stop whatever he wants
[1:02:46] about what he's
[1:02:59] and he's doing something special
[1:03:40] it don't matter what they put in our way
[1:04:07] that's when we take the gates
[1:04:10] last week

[1:05:37] you know teachings going on even in the
[1:05:38] schools now
[1:05:42] especially for our children
[1:05:48] and you know they they they tell their
[1:05:50] children even the youth i believe
[1:05:55] it's okay you know
[1:05:56] to be homosexual established
[1:05:59] homosexuality it's it's fine there's no
[1:06:01] sin in that no
[1:06:16] you know but we as parents
[1:06:21] we gotta make sure
[1:06:24] that we teach our children
[1:06:29] you see because this world
[1:06:32] you see is it it's going to try it's
[1:06:34] going to try and change the way you
[1:06:36] think
[1:06:38] you know it's going to try to mold the
[1:06:40] minds of our children
