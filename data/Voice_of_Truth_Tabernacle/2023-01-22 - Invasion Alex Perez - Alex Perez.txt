concerning Jerusalem foreign there in the province are in great Affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire we'll read one more scripture salmosiete in Psalms 27 and salmosiete scriptures that our pastor love has put down says like this salvation Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid foreign so and my lips my my no no permitas speak any of foolish words amen amen man [Music] amen amen are you ready many of us are happy because and go eat up the

brothers one of his fleshly brothers that had come our Cardinal Brothers had come and given the news great worry about how his native land was happening there in Jerusalem what was occurring no Without Walls without protection protection by the Jews as the Nations left me protection from the enemy now in the case of Jerusalem the wall had a 12 12 gates was assigned by a watch watch men's and uh and and guards watch that City it's very important many objectives for one of them enemy from the outside so to take care of what was inside so that it would not come out something that you have fenced easily um in uh Psalms 51. according to the multitude of Jerusalem I'll repeat it when David begins right what is happening in his life help me in other words [Music] [Applause] at that time the walls had not been uh had not been torn down what is David saying here spiritually when a person falls spiritual Protections in other words Devil comes in and attacks me I cause you begin to drop
