[24:10] foreign
[24:37] he and all the children of Israel and
[24:40] lodged there before they passed over
[24:43] foreign
[24:47] verse two and they came to pass after
[24:49] three days
[24:53] that the officers went through the house
[24:56] Los officiales
[24:59] amen let us pray Brothers
[25:04] we give you thanks Lord we don't we

[25:26] thank you Lord gracias I ask you Lord
[25:29] tonight
[25:30] may you set me aside
[25:33] along with my brother Isaac
[25:36] foreign
[26:50] you know before I explain what I just
[26:52] read right now in Joshua chapter 3 verse
[26:54] 1 and 2.
[26:58] I want to go back in the a little in the
[27:01] story of Joshua
[27:03] and do a quick summary
[27:06] so that we may be able to understand
[27:08] what I want to speak about it
[27:13] you know the new
[27:33] throughout the Journey
[27:35] of Joshua and the children
[27:38] God is with them
[27:41] you know I remember when my brothers
[27:43] were preaching a few weeks ago
[27:50] and how she put her faith
[27:53] and confidence
[27:57] and here we could see the story
[27:59] advancing yeah
[28:14] the Israel is at the Jordan River
[28:19] after 40 Years
[28:21] of wandering in the wilderness
[28:25] you know and I will if we could please
[28:27] read verse one and two again of Joshua
[28:30] chapter 3
[28:33] and Joshua Rose early in the morning and
[28:37] they removed from shatim and came to
[28:39] Jordan he and all the children of Israel
[28:42] and launched there before they passed
[28:44] over
[29:18] they're finally where God wanted them 40
[29:20] years ago
[29:24] you see but they didn't cross Widow
[29:27] right away
[29:58] you
[30:04] see let's remember
[30:07] that we are talking about millions of
[30:09] people
[30:12] that were waiting at the edge of the
[30:14] river
[30:17] it was in a group of ten it wasn't a
[30:20] group of families
[30:23] it was millions of people
[30:27] maybe more than two million dollars
[30:30] who were waiting at the edge of the
[30:32] river
[30:34] and maybe it was easy
[30:38] for the two spies in which Joshua sent
[30:42] before
[30:45] these people now it is difficult
[30:51] for the the millions of people
[30:56] so here they are waiting for three days
[31:00] you know I believe that many things
[31:02] happen during those three days
[31:05] and now I believe a lot of things were
[31:07] going on in the minds of the Israelites
[31:12] let's remember that God has let's
[31:14] remember that God had promised them
[31:18] the promised land
[31:21] you see it but for now
[31:24] God had them there waiting for three
[31:27] days foreign
[32:03] and brings them and puts them to the
[32:04] edge of the river
[32:08] you see I believe that he brought them
[32:12] to the edge
[32:14] and he made them wait
[32:21] so that they could meditate
[32:25] that it is not easy
[32:27] without him
[32:30] you see we have to understand
[32:33] they're all these people
[32:36] have accumulated a lot of things
[32:40] during the past 40 years
[32:44] they're looking at what God has promised
[32:48] you see but there is an obstacle
[32:51] you see now God gives us a promise
[32:55] but at the same time he puts a response
[32:58] puts uh impossibility in it
[33:03] so that we could realize
[33:08] that it is only God
[33:14] that could fulfill that promise
[33:18] you let's not forget
[33:20] Who We Are
[33:22] what we have what we have in this in
[33:26] Christ
[33:27] you see what God has given us
[33:30] what God has given each and every one of
[33:33] them
[33:35] it's no coincidence
[33:38] everything that he has given us
[33:40] it is by his grace
[33:43] you see God promised us
[33:46] that he was gonna be by our side
[33:50] you see she shows us things
[33:53] and he show he put situations in her
[33:56] life
[34:00] so that we may remember
[34:03] that that it is because he permitted it
[34:08] you see
[34:11] he does all these things
[34:14] so that he could give us what he has
[34:16] promised us
[34:21] you see God does all these things
[34:29] certain situations
[34:34] that it is impossible without him
[34:38] nasty but also so he could test our face
[34:45] you see God will always put situations
[34:47] in her life
[34:51] you see so our faith
[34:54] can grow
[34:56] but what does God really want from us
[35:00] see if God wants our confidence
[35:06] in him that can grow
[35:11] you see here's the problem
[35:13] you see many of the times
[35:16] we have confidence
[35:19] in ourselves
[35:22] instead of the Lord
[35:25] and that's the problem
[35:27] you see we have too much confidence in
[35:30] ourselves
[35:43] that we don't need Jesus Anymore
[35:47] you see look what happened to Moses
[35:50] when Moses wanted to take for the when
[35:53] Moses wanted for the first time to take
[35:55] the people of Israel out of Egypt
[36:00] Moses had too much Moses had too much
[36:03] confidence in himself
[36:07] to take the people out of Egypt
[36:10] foreign
[36:23] ERS for 40 years
[36:27] to take all that confidence
[36:32] she has
[36:34] you see
[36:35] and when Moses lost all that confidence
[36:39] then God knew
[36:42] that he could use him
[36:45] you see
[36:48] we are instruments of the Lord
[36:52] and God wants to use us
[36:55] you see many of the times
[36:57] that's the issue you see God wants to
[37:01] develop our faith
[37:04] and now we're confident
[37:06] you see I believe that us
[37:12] has a gift
[37:15] maybe you might not be able to realize
[37:22] foreign
[37:54] you see Joshua chapter 3 verse 3 to 5.
[38:01] and they commanded the people saying
[38:05] when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of
[38:07] the Lord your God
[38:11] and the priest the Levites
[38:15] then ye shall removed from your place
[38:18] and go after it
[38:22] yet there shall be a bit there shall be
[38:25] a space between you and it's
[38:30] about 2 000 cubits by measure
[38:50] ye may know
[38:53] that ye may know
[38:55] the way by which he must go
[38:59] for ye have not passed this way yet
[39:04] for
[39:05] okay okay
[39:08] and Joshua said unto the people
[39:13] sanctify yourself
[39:15] for tomorrow
[39:20] the Lord will do wonders
[39:24] here in verse you know the Bible
[39:27] mentions the Ark of the Covenant
[39:30] and you know what was the ark of the
[39:33] covenant
[39:34] you know I believe that the ark
[39:38] represented
[39:40] the presence of God with the children of
[39:43] Israel
[39:45] you see God commanded Moses
[39:55] so answering the Tabernacle
[39:59] there was different sections
[40:01] if only you would enter the holy place
[40:06] but beyond the holy place
[40:14] was the holiest of holy I'm
[40:20] and that was the Ark of the Covenant
[40:24] you see this is what brother Branham
[40:26] says
[40:28] and a guide preached in 1962
[40:35] what was the orc
[40:39] the word
[40:41] don't travel your domination
[40:43] denominational Roots
[40:47] stay right behind the roots
[40:51] still right behind the word
[40:54] because you haven't passed this way
[40:56] before
[40:59] brother if there ever was a time that
[41:01] the Christian Church
[41:03] ought to examine itself
[41:10] it is right now
[41:13] well right now
[41:15] we're the we're in this great meeting
[41:28] the confederation of churches
[41:33] when all these denominations are
[41:35] confederated together
[41:43] to form the image of the Beast
[41:46] just exactly what the Bible says
[41:49] and you know what we said this morning
[41:51] in the messages
[41:56] everything right at the door
[41:59] and people still following after
[42:02] creating
[42:04] you better stay behind the word
[42:07] foreign
[42:33] [Music]
[42:46] [Music]
[42:57] you see this is the importance of the
[43:00] Ark of the Covenant
[43:03] you see the ark was the presence of God
[43:06] with the people of Israel
[43:10] But Not only was it the presence of God
[43:16] and I like this you see because we could
[43:20] see that God gives a plan to Joshua
[43:23] dios
[43:26] a plan
[44:24] you see God is with us
[44:28] so the same way he was with Joshua and
[44:31] the Israelites
[44:34] you see and if God is with us
[44:37] we can stand against us
[44:40] you see Brothers God wants to put us in
[44:43] situations
[44:45] where it looks difficult
[44:49] and sometimes we don't even know why
[44:53] you see God only wants to do that
[44:57] so that we may learn
[45:01] depend on him
[45:03] because it is
[45:11] only him you see Brothers there's gonna
[45:16] be times
[45:18] where we're gonna be at that Jordan
[45:22] that spiritual Jordan is
[45:25] we're gonna feel like there is no way
[45:28] out
[45:29] maybe that Jordan in your life
[45:33] can be depression anxiety
[45:40] hate audio addiction addiction you see
[45:45] but God provided something
[45:48] God provided something
[45:52] that was the art yes in our time that is
[45:56] the word
[45:58] you see we have the words
[46:02] but not only do we have the words
[46:05] we have the message
[46:08] to see everything that we need is
[46:12] in the words
[46:14] you see but the problem is we have we
[46:18] don't have we have the audacity
[46:22] to not even grab our Bibles
[46:26] we listen to a message
[46:29] for at least five minutes
[46:33] oh brothers
[46:36] or confidence
[46:41] you see Brothers why do we limit Our God
[46:46] you see we have to stop thinking
[46:50] that we can do everything
[47:04] [Music]
[47:23] see our God doesn't have limits
[47:27] he's the same yesterday
[47:30] today and forever
[47:35] please stand with him this is what
[47:38] brother Brandon says the same preaching
[47:41] a guide
[47:45] we're told again that when Israel was
[47:47] following their God and they came right
[47:49] down to Jordan send us
[47:55] right down to the Red Sea must be
[47:59] in the very line of duty they were
[48:01] stopped
[48:04] and the god LED them down there
[48:11] to show his glory
[48:14] and when all hopes was gone
[48:17] then God looked down through that Pillar
[48:20] of Fire
[48:24] And even the old Dead Sea inclusion
[48:31] and she rolled back
[48:33] and there was a path made for Israel
[48:38] to walk over
[48:41] to the promised land
[48:44] holy Lord
[48:46] you're still the same God
[48:50] these people maybe are Christians
[48:54] maybe they're right in the path of Duty
[48:58] but they've been brought into this
[49:00] corner place where sickness has cornered
[49:03] them
[49:13] look down through the blood of Jesus
[49:22] will get scared
[49:25] he'll move back
[49:27] and your children shall pass over to the
[49:30] promise of good health
[49:34] granted father
[49:36] I send it from my body to theirs
[49:40] in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:43] see Brothers there's no reason
[49:47] for us to put our confidence in
[49:49] ourselves
[49:51] you see when we have limits
[49:55] that's where God doesn't
[49:58] you see Brothers
[50:00] when we put our confidence in the Lord
[50:04] nothing can stop us
[50:07] you see that the God knows our potential
[50:12] you know who else those are potentials
[50:15] the devil knows our potential
[50:18] and when we take a hold
[50:22] take a hold of the words
[50:36] to possess the gates of the enemy
[50:42] let us learn to put our confidence in
[50:44] the Lord
[50:46] and lean on him
[50:48] in the good times are in the bad times
[51:01] God bless you brother it is
[51:09] um I admire my brother Samuel Mi hermano
[51:13] Samuel and he inspires me at a young age
[51:16] what God does through him he's Peter uh
[51:22] This Moment reminds me of when we were
[51:25] in Mexico
[51:27] in Mexico we also preached together
[51:31] and you know maybe
[51:34] my brother Samuel needs more um
[51:37] Improvement
[51:40] just like we all need Improvement right
[51:43] but my brother Enoch sitting back there
[51:47] God bless him
[51:49] after the service we had in Mexico
[51:52] in Mexico he shakes my hands and I
[51:56] thought he was gonna say something good
[51:58] right
[52:00] but he tells me he tells me you're a
[52:05] rookie
[52:07] but not a wannabe
[52:11] amen we might need improvements
[52:15] but we know God is working in us
[52:19] we don't want any wannabes in here
[52:23] we don't want one foot in and one foot
[52:25] out
[52:27] we want both feet
[52:31] amen and it's a it's good to be here in
[52:34] this night before you is
[52:37] and before I read the scripture
[52:40] I kind of want us to get everything into
[52:43] sequence
[52:46] and don't worry I'm a teacher that Obama
[52:49] preach a little also
[52:53] God helping uh
[52:56] so uh after the Red Sea Del Mar Rojo now
[53:01] they're at the Jordan River
[53:03] I don't know if you remember the
[53:05] preachings my brother Titus preached uh
[53:07] last year on the series of Joshua this
[53:09] is
[53:14] the Red Sea was a natural baptism of the
[53:17] water it is
[53:22] if you remember there was um excitement
[53:25] by um uh I forgot her name that began to
[53:28] play the tambourine
[53:32] the medium
[54:19] [Applause]
[54:31] and then after that was there so they
[54:35] encamped at gilgal it was
[54:39] on the outside of Jericho he he got this
[54:46] and that's that's what's going on
[54:47] between Joshua chapter 3 to chapter 10.
[54:55] but before Joshua 10
[54:59] Joshua makes an alliance
[55:03] with the gibbian nights
[55:07] yes they deceived Joshua they use
[55:12] in a summary what was going on
[55:16] Joshua was conquering these cities
[55:20] and this man put old garments on yes
[55:26] and they went to Joshua and said we're
[55:29] from
[55:30] fare
[55:32] but they were actually their neighbors
[55:36] and they were scared that Joshua would
[55:39] overtake them
[55:42] so they prefer to make an alliance
[55:48] and here's where I begin the reading of
[55:51] the word in Joshua 10 verse
[55:56] and it says now it came to the past when
[55:59] Don is a king of Jerusalem had heard how
[56:01] Joshua had taken I and had utterly
[56:03] destroyed it as he had done to Jericho
[56:06] and her King so he had done to I and her
[56:08] king and the inhabitants of gibeon made
[56:11] peace with Israel and were among them
[56:15] is
[56:33] that they feared greatly because gabion
[56:36] was a great City and as one of the royal
[56:39] cities and because it was higher than I
[56:41] and all the men thereof were Mighty uh
[56:45] fuertes
[56:54] and to save time brother and I'm going
[56:56] to skip to verse 12.
[57:00] and it's and uh this night
[57:04] our title is the hour of Crisis
[57:08] and what my focus will be is
[57:12] two things in this night
[57:15] uh the first one will be Joshua's error
[57:19] is
[57:20] Josue and how God can take a mistake
[57:26] and turn it into a victory
[57:30] it says in uh verse 12 verse and I'll be
[57:34] speaking when Joshua stops the sun
[57:39] then speak Joshua to the Lord in the day
[57:42] when the Lord delivered up the amorites
[57:43] before the children of Israel and he
[57:45] said in the side of Israel Sons stand
[57:48] out still upon gibeon and thou moon in
[57:50] the valley of agilon is
[58:05] amen amen one of the most outstanding
[58:08] verses in the Bible I believe
[58:12] is
[58:14] that you can find that a human being
[58:18] stop the sun
[58:20] you know the creation beside Adam
[58:26] um beside Adam
[58:28] obey Joshua too over this
[58:31] and you can't we can't explain it
[58:35] it's a paradox
[58:37] and Paradox is also a miracle
[58:41] just like everyone sitting here
[58:45] it's a miracle now everything that was
[58:48] going on in Joshua's life
[58:52] was preparing him for that historical
[59:09] the Bible mentions
[59:13] everywhere
[59:15] if my name was in the Bible
[59:18] it would mention all my mistakes foreign
[59:42] you know someone that sins
[59:45] makes mistakes
[59:48] and that's me Brothers now brother
[59:51] Branham says that the Bible is a book
[59:54] about God
[59:58] not about men because God exposes the
[1:00:03] mistakes of men
[1:00:06] so that we can see
[1:00:09] how great the power of God is
[1:00:13] he speaks about the mistakes and
[1:00:16] failures
[1:00:19] of Joshua
[1:00:21] and we should be thankful in this night
[1:00:25] that we can identify
[1:00:28] identification with this great men
[1:00:32] doesn't matter what they did
[1:00:35] they were still God's chosen
[1:00:40] you know in chapter nine we see where
[1:00:42] Josh
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:00:53] after taking these cities
[1:00:57] you know like I said they deceived
[1:01:00] Joshua
[1:01:01] to make an alliance
[1:01:04] you know and when a man fails
[1:01:10] the people begin to speak
[1:01:13] has anyone made a mistake
[1:01:18] and there's rumors about you now
[1:01:21] we can identify
[1:01:24] the same Joshua went through
[1:01:28] he made an alliance he wasn't supposed
[1:01:30] to is
[1:01:32] he didn't search for God's
[1:01:35] um advice
[1:01:42] here I'm not sure if I'll keep following
[1:01:45] him
[1:01:47] no I saw this at church
[1:01:51] I'm not sure if God is with them you
[1:01:53] know
[1:01:55] we begin to the devil begins to work in
[1:02:00] us
[1:02:02] you know and I'm not sure if this is
[1:02:05] God's chosen people now
[1:02:08] but God chooses
[1:02:12] human beings
[1:02:14] God has never chosen Angels
[1:02:18] or any other thing
[1:02:21] it's always been man
[1:02:24] leading man
[1:02:26] amen and we don't want to get
[1:02:28] controversial
[1:02:30] but God chooses
[1:02:37] amen amen
[1:02:39] oh
[1:02:40] my God I'm reaching about now
[1:02:44] you know and Joshua's mistake
[1:02:48] was making an alliance with
[1:02:51] gabians
[1:02:54] that's what the war about that's what
[1:02:57] the war was about
[1:02:59] when the Sun starts
[1:03:03] Joshua is about to have War persuade
[1:03:08] over an alliance
[1:03:11] and I know I'm repeating a lot
[1:03:18] because many times we're making
[1:03:20] alliances
[1:03:22] with the wrong people with the wrong
[1:03:26] things
[1:03:27] we're starting friendships
[1:03:30] when there should be friendships
[1:03:34] we should be standing with each other
[1:03:38] and it's good to have friends out there
[1:03:42] no maybe you're fishing from for Souls
[1:03:47] you know but we should begin here with
[1:03:50] the ones God has given us
[1:03:54] amen amen you know it matters who you're
[1:03:57] friends with it's important
[1:04:00] it matters who you're associated with it
[1:04:04] with you who you have an alliance with
[1:04:07] and you have to make a decision
[1:04:11] to ask for advice
[1:04:14] when you're gonna join someone
[1:04:17] or something or I'll go because there's
[1:04:20] battles that will be yours because
[1:04:24] they're the other person's battles that
[1:04:27] you're associated with because
[1:04:31] you know many times we join the wrong
[1:04:34] thing
[1:04:36] correct we hang out with the wrong
[1:04:38] person
[1:04:39] and we're fighting battles
[1:04:42] and trials that we shouldn't be fighting
[1:04:47] Joshua didn't need to fight this battles
[1:04:51] but he didn't look for advice he got
[1:04:55] himself in there
[1:05:33] you know we're fighting these things
[1:05:35] because we weren't careful
[1:05:39] when we decided to choose
[1:05:43] who to identify with
[1:05:46] identification you know for the Youth I
[1:05:48] know we go to school and we see nice
[1:05:50] things and we want to identify with them
[1:06:54] the world is also here
[1:07:19] um
[1:07:23] they went against scorpion foreign
[1:07:46] foreign
[1:09:46] foreign if anyone did something bad to
[1:09:49] me oh I'll go meso I'll go Malo if
[1:09:52] anyone spoke against me here blowing
[1:09:54] Contra de me
[1:09:56] Joshua Josue was still standing
[1:10:00] next to gibbian
[1:10:02] no matter how much they deceived him
[1:10:06] no matter how much they lied to him
[1:10:10] there's consequences to our mistakes
[1:10:15] but God sees beyond that
[1:10:18] you know and if God sees beyond that
[1:10:22] we should see Beyonce
[1:10:24] we should still stand with each other
[1:10:27] we need to see it how the word says it's
[1:10:31] a spiritual fight spiritual
[1:10:35] and uh right now the the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:38] uh moving in here
[1:10:41] and uh brother Titus said on Sunday that
[1:10:45] is
[1:10:46] the people that are in the sewers
[1:10:51] are the people that come and think I
[1:10:54] have to give you any pizza about other
[1:10:56] people here
[1:10:58] that are not where they should be okay
[1:11:01] and that was me brother yes and I
[1:11:05] thought I was right
[1:11:08] I was in the sewers
[1:11:11] we shouldn't come to church
[1:11:14] and criticize
[1:11:16] because they're not where they're
[1:11:18] supposed to be
[1:11:21] no it's their process
[1:11:24] you know uh I was I wanted to be strict
[1:11:27] one time
[1:11:29] and my pastor corrected me
[1:11:32] he told me be strict with yourself sir
[1:12:06] you know what gibians
[1:12:09] you're a deceiver
[1:12:12] you're a liar mentiroso you struggle in
[1:12:16] your own way but
[1:12:19] if the enemy comes against you
[1:12:24] count on me
[1:12:26] how many can say that
[1:12:29] how many can tell their neighbors
[1:12:32] right now count on Mego
[1:13:02] you know this was Joshua's third pole
[1:13:06] you know he fought in Jericho he fought
[1:13:11] and this was the third battle
[1:13:14] and he was about to go to Wars
[1:13:19] with five Kings
[1:13:23] ought to be a Gibby inside
[1:13:27] you know he didn't have to fight
[1:13:31] but he was faithful to his word
[1:13:35] no he was a man of his word
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:14:30] that the sun is still still in our time
[1:14:35] God is still giving us time
[1:14:42] to forgive that last person
[1:14:46] to forgive ourselves
[1:14:49] to fix the mistake
[1:14:52] you know God redeemed the time for
[1:14:55] Joshua
[1:14:56] that he lost
[1:14:59] how many can say tonight
[1:15:02] Lord I messed up
[1:15:06] made mistakes
[1:15:08] I need time to fix my life
[1:15:15] I need time
[1:15:17] Chase these armies down
[1:15:22] and obtain my victory Victoria and in
[1:15:25] this night we need time
[1:15:29] and God is giving us mercy and Grace
[1:15:33] so do what we were sent to do but uh
[1:15:47] you may stand I'll be closing now
[1:15:53] if God hasn't come yet
[1:15:57] if God hasn't come yet
[1:16:00] it's because he's giving us time
[1:16:04] we're in the evening times
[1:16:08] It's Not Dark Yet
[1:16:11] because God is waiting for us
[1:16:15] to fulfill the job
[1:16:21] God let the whole world knows
[1:16:27] that day that the sun Stood Still yes
[1:16:30] it didn't matter how many mistakes
[1:16:33] Joshua had no important
[1:16:36] it didn't matter all the bad things he
[1:16:39] had done
[1:16:41] but in public
[1:16:45] that he supported
[1:16:49] God was saying
[1:16:51] I'm still on his side
[1:16:55] and Heaven supports him
[1:17:16] you can stop the sun tonight
