one [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] he may be [Music] is [Music] [Laughter] [Music] a [Music] let us open our bibles apocalypses to the book of revelation capitola chapter 2. verse 1. if you know your bible you'll find out we'll be reading from the ephesian church we've gone over the ephesian church age before uh since we're beginning the small groups we're going to be doing a summary over those ages against don't worry we're not going to last as long as we have previously um there's going to they're going to be much shorter summaries these things said he that holded the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and i labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say the apostles and they're not and has found them liars and it has borne and has patience and for my namesake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left i first love remember therefore from once thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent what's on that let us pray senor jesus christ lord jesus christ we come before you asking of your mercy and grace as we come upon thy word nosotros no somos amen amen with us once again yes then like it's been quite a bit of days since i haven't seen you here i'm happy to be here alongside his wife the lord blessed him and helped him um i'm sure we will see them here very soon ah so look at then i want to focus on what on the special services that will be this weekend let's take a little bit on the word of god i just want to focus on verse 4 and verse 5. says nevertheless i have someone against you because thou has left thy first love now one of the things i want to i want you to take notice on this age is it's the beginning of the christian uh church the christian church the gentile church had just been born established it was it was a new pena have been witnesses of the lord jesus christ himself cinembargo but even but even then they they had fallen yeah i asked myself how much much more us in in the seventh church age um and he has given us so much less but how easy it is brothers how easy it is how easy it is to forget he takes [Applause] it's been 10 years we came with marcos fort collins to the city of fort collins through a dream and and the guidance of god um there was not a church here oh yeah there was god has never left us we are so busy many times yeah we can't do a whole lot for god brother but i i want to remind you what god has done for us in these 10 years done very much for our church for each and every one of our families the things god has delivered us from because it's easy for the devil to try and take them away to forget what god has has done in my life god has done all for us god has done i don't deserve what god has done for me it's easy to forget about it why we actually do it it becomes a routine to us we come to a church in a very routine way but brother branham says in the the sardisian churches preaching twelve nine of 1960 the first church age was the ephesian church age from 1855 to 170. pablo fuel estrella es paul being the star and it was the first church age works without love was god's complaint viga obras say works without love what's god's complaint now i want to focus a little bit on that number uno number one [Music] what's my objective okay that they would see me and english in the spotlight to be in the in the limelight in uh that's what god tells me you know when i stand up here yo i gotta i have to check myself because uh there are times the preachers have that to have that temptation now i'm going with love las cosas so things change brothers i have to ask myself that question how am i doing what i am doing [Music] when you come and do it and you do it just like anything else and then doing [Music] most precious thing that god and what would i be to come in and treat you like you were just anything great man i am wrong falls upon [Music] without love i want to i want to do things with love remember therefore from whence downward fallen and repent and do the first works now look the problem wasn't that was not the problem the problem was that they were doing it without love so then god tells them to go back and do it once again but this time i just look on that one do it with love do it a different eva and you'll have different results believe we haven't always done things with love yes to say lord let's do it again i want to do it again [Music] i want to do it again [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] too early to start again [Music] [Music] god has blessed us [Music] we were to start again [Music] what if you you took the initiative to to start again [Music] [Music] [Music] deserve it [Music] would there be somebody here [Music] [Music] but i want to do it different [Music] and see why i'm doing [Music] [Music] lord i don't want to do it without love [Music] i want to serve my brothers with love [Music] i don't want to think of myself [Music] [Music] stand it's a good moment to start again [Music] do the [Music] [Music] but i want to serve you with love let's go ask do things [Music] for your children so much [Music] is [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] you is [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh oh [Music]
