[0:00] check up with our spiritual being but in
[0:04] our may we check our fellowship with
[0:06] thee and forgive us of all of our sins
[0:10] and we ask that your spirit will deal
[0:14] with us tonight
[0:32] should there be any unclean thing about
[0:35] us Lord take it as far as the East is
[0:38] from the West
[0:39] casted into the sea of forgetfulness to
[0:42] remember it against us no more that we
[0:45] might enter into this New Year clean
[0:48] Washed by the blood of the lamb and be
[0:51] ready
[1:00] olympios
[1:10] Montana
[1:38] and he couldn't make up his mind
[1:40] the devil kept beating him out of it one
[1:43] day out in the field he knelt down the
[1:45] plane
[1:46] while he was praying he drove down a
[1:49] stop he said let this be a March you to
[1:52] this stop
[1:53] now I'll tell you that right here I met
[1:56] God that it was settled from your home
[1:58] amen is
[2:28] that's what we need maybe not a starving
[2:32] a field
[2:33] but somewhere some secret closet some
[2:37] place not a yes
[2:54] hundreds of vowels taken thousands of
[2:57] them taken and next year we'll have to
[3:00] take them all over again
[3:11] we'll say We'll quit lines we'll quit
[3:13] doing this and we'll uh last on our
[3:16] temper we'll do more for God we'll do
[3:18] this or that the other only to find it's
[3:20] in vain
[3:24] is
[3:35] what man needs to do tonight is come
[3:38] face to face with God and from there on
[3:41] he's a change Church
[3:44] Hallelujah perum located
[3:57] Hallelujah
[4:00] could tell it in a way that I believe it
[4:03] but when a man meets God
[4:09] never be the same because it's got
[4:11] eternal life
[4:12] foreign
[4:36] [Music]
[4:47] in a little while the church will be
[4:49] gathering here around the altar
[4:52] you'll be consecrating your lives anew
[4:55] you'll be giving up things and laying
[4:57] things on the altars
[5:03] this is
[5:11] brother let me give you some advice if
[5:14] you've never met God face to face let me
[5:17] tell you something you stay at that
[5:19] altar
[5:20] just stay there until you meet God
[5:25] then you can point your fingers back to
[5:27] that new year night
[5:31] she said
[5:50] honestly I turned a new page I made a
[5:53] new battle but from that time on I met
[5:57] God in life as change and things were
[6:00] different and everything become new to
[6:02] me again from that time on the time that
[6:06] you meet God
[6:10] is
[6:29] it ain't me the new year we're going to
[6:32] face it in a few minutes after a while
[6:34] about two and a half hours I suppose
[6:35] maybe less than that we will be meeting
[6:39] a new year face to face
[6:51] Nuevo caracara we'll meet it with vows
[6:54] we'll meet it with pledges we'll meet it
[6:57] with good intention
[6:59] saying we'll try to turn a new page
[7:02] that's all good I appreciate that is
[7:22] it'll never be Eternal until
[7:25] God first
[7:26] when you meet God first and from then on
[7:30] everything will be different
[7:33] let us pray when we bow our heads
[7:49] so now
[7:52] these are coming new year and we don't
[7:55] believe in turning new pages we just
[7:57] believe in
[7:58] burning the old yeah Nuevo
[8:03] no cremos nuevas
[8:07] solo cremos
[8:10] so uh just
[8:13] keep yourself consecrated to God through
[8:16] the coming year we don't know what the
[8:19] Lord will do for us
[8:30] but we are grateful for every one of you
[8:34] I'm very thankful to God for every
[8:38] member of the body of Christ amen
[8:40] everywhere
[8:42] is
[8:52] and in all different phases of faith no
[8:56] matter how much they might disagree with
[8:59] me I'm still grateful it's somebody even
[9:01] if I think they'd be a little an error
[9:05] in the scripture but yet trying to
[9:07] earnestly stand for what they believe
[9:13] important
[9:28] I'm certainly willing to bear with those
[9:30] Brethren and then bear with me in my
[9:34] errors and things because there is none
[9:36] of us perfect

[46:22] give thanks to God
[46:37] [Music]
[46:42] and always with the expectation
[46:48] I think not only to receive more from
[46:50] him
[46:51] but also to do more for him
[46:54] to do more for his word
[46:57] to do more for our brothers
[47:08] let's go to a small scripture
[47:12] in the book of Lamentations chapter
[47:14] three
[47:16] we're going to be reading verse 22.3 23
[47:21] 24 and 25. Lamentations Lamentations
[47:26] chapter three
[47:28] verses 22.3 23. 24 and 25.
[47:40] this is the Lord's mercies that we are
[47:42] not consumed because his compassions
[47:44] fail not
[47:46] stupid
[47:48] they are new every morning great is thy
[47:50] faithfulness
[47:54] the Lord is my portion saith my soul
[47:56] therefore will I hope in him
[48:02] the Lord is good unto them that wait for
[48:04] him to the soul that seeketh him he may
[48:07] be seated
[48:27] there will be two years
[48:39] it wasn't exactly in the first couple
[48:42] hours of New Year's hey
[48:49] I was the first to receive the the call
[48:51] at three or four in the morning
[48:54] on behalf of my uh niece
[48:58] and when she told me
[49:00] um
[49:02] he's passed away
[49:23] why did
[49:26] this happen
[49:29] and he begins to Corner you more and
[49:31] more
[49:33] to the point that it makes you doubt
[49:59] God speaks to us
[50:05] that's why I chose this scripture
[50:17] that's what keeps us in this year that's
[50:20] about to be foreign
[50:40] he
[50:45] Comforts us
[51:00] to show the enemy
[51:03] is who my God is
[51:12] in the message one greater than Solomon
[51:14] is here yes
[51:18] the small gift that God gave me is
[51:23] to try and do our best here in these
[51:25] little Corners
[51:28] you can't be bound by things such as
[51:31] money and programs
[51:33] we should just do our best
[51:35] in the little corners
[51:38] and and begin the thing is
[52:14] doesn't matter what I go through
[52:19] what else can I ask of life if he's my
[52:22] portion
[52:25] Brothers
[52:30] we're about to end the year
[52:35] if God allows
[52:38] a new year will begin with new goals
[52:42] with new challenges
[52:48] even from our little corner
[52:51] he's with us
[52:53] he is our portion God bless you
[53:02] God bless you Brothers
[53:08] and all year is about to be finished
[53:12] it's about to begin
[53:16] we've uh placed a new propositions for
[53:19] us amen amen
[53:32] we should want to
[53:35] bejores we should want to be better than
[53:37] what we do
[53:39] Cristiano how much better is our
[53:41] Christmas amen
[53:49] the new year I don't know what it holds
[53:53] we don't know
[53:57] does someone here the only God knows
[54:02] but I know he holds it
[54:47] I just trust the future to him
[54:50] I don't know what it is
[54:54] I just trusted to him
[54:59] you've seen him vindicate his words
[55:08] you know it's going to be done his word
[55:14] Philippians 3 13 says
[55:18] Brothers I count myself not to have
[55:21] apprehended but that's one thing I do
[55:25] forgetting those things which are behind
[55:30] he also forgets the battles
[55:33] we as humans it's so hard
[55:38] to leave the past in the past
[55:42] but the Apostle Paul is
[55:44] let's forget what's in the past yes
[55:48] and reaching Force for what is ahead
[55:51] continuation to continue to keep
[55:55] watching look I'm going to confess
[55:57] something
[55:58] the devil has tried to defeat me over
[56:02] here
[56:03] I'm sure he's done the same to you
[56:06] so you know the devil has to become
[56:09] accustomed to something
[56:10] he has to become accustomed or he has to
[56:14] get used to losing
[56:16] I am a winner
[56:19] is Winners
[56:24] the devil's not happy that you're here
[56:26] but I know who I am I am a winner
[57:25] so for the New Years
[57:30] determined to stay with his words
[57:32] and what its promise
[57:36] like others elected did in the other
[57:39] days

[2:17:45] now it tells you here that you have to
[2:17:48] ever yourself
[2:17:55] they think Grace or salvation is free
[2:18:24] now there was Elisha
[2:19:21] your Lord shall be taken away

[2:19:46] he kept his eyes on him

[2:22:41] had discouragements in his life
[2:22:44] Jesus Christ
[2:22:49] discouragement in his life
[2:22:52] there's great men in the Bible that
[2:22:54] wanted to run away
[2:22:59] is this
[2:23:02] to whom shall we go
[2:23:05] the song says to whom shall we go
[2:23:10] to whom shall I go
[2:23:14] where are we going
[2:23:19] when we're going to depart from this
[2:23:21] earth oh

[2:24:06] who was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen
[2:24:09] before him and he with the twelfth and
[2:24:12] Elijah passed by him and cast his mental
[2:24:14] upon him
[2:24:26] and he left the auction and ran after
[2:24:29] Elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss
[2:24:32] my father and my mother and then I will
[2:24:34] follow thee and then he said unto him go
[2:24:36] back again for what have I done to thee
[2:24:38] Anton says
[2:24:51] and he returned back from him and took a
[2:24:54] yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled
[2:24:56] their flesh with the instrument of the
[2:24:58] ox sin and gave unto the people and they
[2:25:01] did eat then he arose and went after
[2:25:03] Elijah administered unto him is
[2:25:16] you may be seated
[2:25:18] you know uh
[2:25:21] one of the things that I learned from
[2:25:23] the scripture is
[2:25:25] that you know when Elijah found Elijah
[2:25:29] Elias
[2:25:32] so when Elijah found Elijah
[2:25:36] he found in plowing
[2:25:39] he didn't find them just doing nothing
[2:25:44] he saw something special
[2:25:47] you know and I think that you know this
[2:25:50] year has showed me
[2:25:52] that you know the god that God's willing
[2:25:55] to help you know those that are willing
[2:25:56] to put in the word
[2:26:00] willing to put in the time
[2:26:02] you know I like I like uh you know this
[2:26:05] Elisha was a committed man
[2:26:09] he was committed
[2:26:12] he was completely committed to the Lord
[2:26:15] I wasn't just telling everybody
[2:26:18] but he went and he burned everything
[2:26:32] [Music]
[2:27:19] at least foreign
[2:28:20] foreign
[2:29:16] that that is actually the biggest
[2:29:19] difference
[2:29:23] that's right
[2:29:26] it will determine everything
[2:29:31] listen to this
[2:29:34] he says so that little piece of
[2:29:37] scripture
[2:29:39] just a teeny little one inch square
[2:29:43] on just a piece of paper
[2:29:46] yet if the right attitude is taken to
[2:29:49] the Scripture
[2:29:52] it would change the Eternal destination
[2:29:55] of this world
[2:29:58] it is
[2:30:04] you see it's the right attitude
[2:30:08] any promise of God
[2:30:13] whether you fail
[2:30:16] or you have success
[2:30:18] how are you looking into this year
[2:30:22] what are you gonna do
[2:30:24] what will you do get out there because
[2:30:27] we could try all we wanted
[2:30:30] but that's not gonna help
[2:30:32] you see when the brothers
[2:30:38] my brothers
[2:30:49] he used to talk to us because they used
[2:30:53] to talk to us when he wasn't so blessed
[2:30:56] you see the only difference is
[2:31:01] not necessarily maybe no neces but I
[2:31:05] believe that sometimes a Brother's
[2:31:07] blessed and the other one's not yeah
[2:31:11] the only difference is
[2:31:15] because one was willing to put in the
[2:31:18] world
[2:31:22] that was the only difference
[2:31:25] he was willing to work
[2:31:35] it was willing to have the right
[2:31:39] attitude
[2:31:45] that's the difference
[2:31:51] foreign
[2:32:03] [Applause]
[2:33:16] this man was willing to wear it
[2:33:20] not part-time not uh Tiempo he was all
[2:33:24] in at least he was committed to God
[2:33:29] he might have gotten tired
[2:33:31] but he had burned everything he had
[2:33:35] he burned everything
[2:33:37] because he had a college he was gonna
[2:33:41] follow God
[2:33:42] no matter what it took
[2:33:45] no matter who he had to leave
[2:33:52] yes
[2:34:01] he was committed to God
[2:34:04] there's a lot of times
[2:34:06] when we feel like we can't continue yes
[2:34:12] but you gotta be strong
[2:34:18] I learned one thing this year foreign
[2:34:23] [Music]

[2:34:34] vienne it comes from the tents from the
[2:34:36] from from something tender viennes
[2:34:39] something soft I'll go tierno that's
[2:34:42] right that's what I believe because
[2:34:45] though you know the only reason that I
[2:34:47] wake up about it a lot of times
[2:34:52] forum
[2:35:15] there's a soft side
[2:35:17] I believe that that's that's what the
[2:35:19] Lord showed us
[2:35:21] when he left his throne
[2:35:26] and that was his pride yesterday
[2:35:43] your brothers

[2:47:19] can you play something soft
[2:47:22] uh you know
[2:47:25] I'm not programmed to speak but um
[2:47:30] or while I was back there it was
[2:47:33] um
[2:47:37] to remind me everything happening
[2:47:39] tonight
[2:47:42] and you know the title of this
[2:47:46] God put this in the heart of Brother
[2:47:48] John uh
[2:47:52] he thought he brought that thought and
[2:47:55] we felt it was God
[2:47:57] and as I was back there
[2:48:01] brother John was giving me his whole
[2:48:03] preaching
[2:48:04] his entire preaching he was giving it to
[2:48:08] me
[2:48:10] simply sharing it
[2:48:12] and while I was back there
[2:48:17] told me say what he was sharing with you
[2:48:21] because we were sharing between the both
[2:48:24] of them well the majority that I'm gonna
[2:48:26] say is
[2:48:29] teaching
[2:48:31] and I believe
[2:48:37] that
[2:48:39] Elisha received mental the mantle uh
[2:48:44] residuals
[2:48:46] he didn't receive it just because he saw
[2:48:49] it at the end
[2:48:52] he received it because he went through
[2:48:55] all that process
[2:48:56] [Music]
[2:48:58] he began
[2:49:00] and gilgal primero first in gilgal
[2:49:03] Eagle
[2:49:05] is Brother John was telling significant
[2:49:10] means to go red circles
[2:49:13] means uh go in circles
[2:49:16] and many times we stay there
[2:49:20] going in circles
[2:49:23] but he didn't stop there
[2:49:27] every one of the places he wins
[2:49:30] you know we went to Israel
[2:49:35] and every place
[2:49:39] they were horrible places
[2:49:54] all those places are in the desert
[2:49:58] it was a hard package
[2:50:01] it was the entire process
[2:50:14] was that he never stayed foreign
[2:51:17] palm trees because that's where they
[2:51:19] vacation
[2:51:22] foreign
[2:52:40] don't stop there
[2:52:43] no security don't stop there
[2:52:45] [Music]
[2:52:47] many of us are relaxed
[2:52:50] [Music]
[2:52:58] he went
[2:53:02] to cross the Jordan
[2:53:07] and brother John put it this way
[2:53:13] Jordan means to send
[2:53:16] and this is
[2:53:18] before Elijah ascended he had to descend
[2:53:24] es
[2:53:26] and before we can receive something else
[2:53:29] from God
[2:53:30] we have to descend
[2:53:32] you have to be humble Jesus Christ
[2:53:40] if the grain of corn does not fall on on
[2:53:42] the ground and die it remains alone
[2:53:48] please don't come to the altar we'll be
[2:53:50] doing a prayer line foreign
[2:54:00] foreign
[2:54:05] if the crane of wheat does not fall on
[2:54:08] the ground and die it remains alone
[2:54:11] in other words it stays the same
[2:54:14] time I don't want to be the same next
[2:54:18] year
[2:54:18] [Music]
[2:54:22] I don't want to end this year and
[2:54:25] continue the same next year the same yo
[2:54:27] quiero I want
[2:54:29] that fruit so bear fruit
[2:54:33] s
[2:54:36] Jesus Christ said if the grain of wheat
[2:54:38] does not fall on the ground you die
[2:54:40] remains alone but if it dies it brings
[2:54:42] forth much fruits I'm not sure what
[2:54:45] you've been saying but there's a way to
[2:54:48] walk
[2:54:50] there's something else to do
[2:54:52] is more to sacrifice for God
[2:54:56] I don't think uh not anything
[2:55:02] it was a coincidence for Brother John
[2:55:04] has sure he's preaching with me
[2:55:15] I don't think it's coincidence
[2:55:17] [Music]
