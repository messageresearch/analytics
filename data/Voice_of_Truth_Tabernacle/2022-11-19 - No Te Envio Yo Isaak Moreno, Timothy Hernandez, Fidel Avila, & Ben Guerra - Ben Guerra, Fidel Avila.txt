are thankful to be here tonight amen um if you may open your Bibles to Judges chapter six while you guys are opening your Bibles um our title that we have put this night is and we'll be speaking about Gideon tonight amen imagine amen we'll be reading verses 11 through 16. and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in Oprah that pertained unto joash the aberration and his son Gideon thresh wheat by the wine press to hide it from the middle Knights is and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of value and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befall in us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee is and he said unto him oh my Lord we wish shall I say visual behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my fam and my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the mere Knights as one man is amen let's bow our heads in prayer Lord we give you thanks gracias tonight for letting us gather here at your house that may speak the words that you want me to speak Lord as well as the brothers would be going after me that may be a blessing to at least one Soul yes we thank you for everything we asked us on your name amen amen amen you may be seated amen as we see in this In this passage of the Bible [Music] you see God has a message but God always has a man as well you see we meet the man God chose to save Israel we meet a man named Gideon and his name means he who cuts down well you know in this time it didn't look like you didn't have much to offer a moment at the time that he was called he would be responsible for cutting down the enemies of God's people amen responsibility you see just a little background real quick you know it was a time of poverty you know we know that Israel did not have a lot during these times uh the Israel Israel didn't have Allah these signs were dark and desperate days for them [Music] and his family were hiding in a wine press they're threshing weed behind a wine press my bad it is and they were hiding from the middle of the night is time of persecution the middle Knights were persecuting all all the people from Israel it was a time of powerlessness you see we see this and the fact that Gideon was hiding from his enemy he's just as defeated and just as frightening as the rest of the Nations it was a difficult time for his people foreign has many people fearing that they will be first forced into poverty as well you know we're living in days when it seems that there is little spiritual power among God's people so in some ways we're living through times that strongly resemble these that Gideon was in as as in Israel's time we are living in times in some ways we're living through times that strongly resemble those that Gideon and Israel you know we see Gideon was hiding um and a lot of times you know we're hiding from the enemies but you know the Lord knew exactly where Gideon was do not know where Gideon was he had his eye on Gideon the whole time even when Gideon was unaware of it God was with them and God was playing his future amen should come for us as well we had the same promise because it says in Hebrews 13 5. keep your life eyes free from the love of money and be content with what you have because God has said never Where I Leave You never will I forsake you know amen the Lord is always with us amen they might not feel them at the time but you know when we're in our lowest time we're in the valley we're in the mountains we're wearing our struggles when we're in sickness he's always there with us and you know when the Lord says the Lord Irwin yeah when the Lord says the Lord is with me it literally means his power is on you see Gideon cannot see it and it sure didn't look like it you see we see that because he was scared he didn't know what kind of power he really had because but he was about to use the Lord's power in a mighty way um and the same and it goes the same in our lives as well if whoever grabs the truth that we are by the spirit of God and that has limited power is available to us and it will change our lives amen amen I I find something really amazing you know the Lord looks at Gideon you know scared uh by yourself doubting himself low self-esteem amen he was a poor man amen you know and he looks at Gideon and calls him a mighty man of value amen you know it's it's amazing how God could cause someone so low foreign you know and I just want to read a quote from Brother Branham from the from the message have now I sent the the knows um code 96 paragraph 96 and when he spoke to Gideon Gideon was a little surprised he said now Mighty Man of Valor he says he didn't know who he was maybe you don't know who you are you might be many of those Mighty Men of value tonight the little church my group is oh my there was only two there him and his daddy there only has to be two here you and Christ that's all it takes to be a mighty man of value that's right yes correct see God specializes and uses those uh especially who can't cannot Britain to accomplish his work in the world you see uh there's um another book in the Bible First Corinthians 26 29. it says brothers and sisters think of what you were when you were called not many of you were Wise by human standards not many were influential not many were of noble birth but but God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong amen God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things and the things that are not to notify the things that are so that no one may boast before him hey man see God's Gonna use the weak so one day shame the strong amen God's going to use the foolish the wise amen you know Gideon I mean he thought he was nothing he thought he was fight foolish you know I believe his family thought he was you know no one you see we could see um when Jesse looked at Davido he saw his youngest son mere boy who was not worthy to be called to a family meeting with Samuel um and he saw a king amen and when Gideon family looked at him but when the Lord looked at us God seen a warrior amen and you see when the Lord looks at you he doesn't see a weakling we don't want to see someone that's fearful attack the enemy overcome to step up and Rise And tell the enemies you see a lot of the times we're making excuses this is Gideon did exactly what Moses did and then when the Lord Called Moses from the burning bush he made excuses amen both of these men felt like that job was too over their heads that was a job too high for them the real problem with Gideon and Moses and with us as well is that we tend to focus on what we are but we don't focus on who he is amen because he's greater than anything because to be honest without the Lord we are weakness we're frail failures we always spell without him we are Mighty through God to pulling down of strongholds amen I'm about closed captioning not available are you doing what the Lord wants you to do have you found that place of service that he saved you to feel are you content to stand back While others do all the work are you fearful has he been calling you to do something but you hold back making your excuses as to why you can't do that is today the day when you will when you would throw up the white flag of surrender and trust the Lord to do his perfect will in your life are we safe today would be a good day to come to Jesus if you are not always if he's drawing you on any level tonight be obedient to his voice come and let the Lord have his way in your life amen God bless you Brothers [Applause] God bless you can hear me why don't we give a strong amount of Applause to the Lord because he deserves it amen doesn't he deserve all honor and Glory he does amen amen I want to thank brother Isaac for the for the preaching you know every day that God keeps us with life there's another day we won another opportunity another day to make a decision that can either make your life or break your life so is today going to be the day that you make the decisions to follow Christ amen amen good enough I want to read uh two three verses in the in the book of uh Judges chapter six verse 12. essays like this and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valerie and getting said unto him now pay attention oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why isn't all this befallen us and where is all the Miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us us from Egypt but now the Lord had forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the medianites and I hear the Lord is it talks to to Gideon and says and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel on the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee yes and verse 23 and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die now as I read the book of uh judges I say four things that God sometimes does big things and unlikely ways number two it's not your battle many times in the Book of Judges the goddess I the Lord and with you I the Lord will take you number three God will accomplish his plan God will always accomplish his plans and God wants leaders to walk in confidence by faith now when the Lord spoke to him and says Thou Mighty Man of Valerie you know and then in the New International Version it says a mighty warrior Guerrero now brother Brown states that Gideon was probably in his mid 50s he was bald headed and with sheepskin over him as a clothing he says there was nothing to him another thing about him nothing extraordinary you know God takes people there is nothing too that's what God wants people who are surrendered people that have no rights you know God God calls us worthy and his children and Gideon you know in verse 15. he he makes an excuse he says behold my family is poor me uh and I am the least in my father's house let me tell you something for God there's no excuses for God there's no excuse God will fulfill his plan don't matter you know most of us do not look at ourselves as worthy most of us instead see ourselves poisonous before our worthy God most of us hear ourselves unworthy before our worthy guys uh and that there's nothing in us that would qualify us as worthy but then God looks at us and says but I see you worthy and that is what what God was telling to Gideon I see you worthy to accomplish the plan that I have for the people of Israel you know but we asked how is that possible how can our holy righteous Almighty all-knowing you know look at us and think us worthy because our worthiness does not generate from us it generates from him who lives in us because he because he who is where he lives inside of us God makes us worthy God made Gideon Worthy amen amen you know Gideon was was fearful and he was scared but God will always accomplish his plan you know you are here tonight because he saw something God saw something in each and every one of us here tonight Gideon's thoughts that disqualified himself now listen closely that disqualified himself in his own eyes did not disqualify him in the in the eyes of God there's nothing that disqualifies you yeah for being Worthy you know sometimes we put ourselves thoughts we think ourselves of ourselves that we can't do certain things oh God can't use me you know or I can't strongly I can't help in the sun is cool I can't sing a special or I can't help out any part of church you know that's what you think but what does God think about what did God think of Gideon he saw wave past his fault he saw way past his ears as brother Isaac said it takes you in Christ here tonight to be a mighty man woman you know God wants people who aren't perfect you know people who are willing to leave everything look Abraham was old Elijah was to his title Joseph was abused Joe went bankrupt Moses had a speech problems getting was afraid Samson was a womanizer Rahab was a prostitute American woman a divorce Noah was a drunk Jeremiah Was Young Jacob was a cheater David Peter denied Christ three times Martha worried about everything the disciples fell asleep while praying a Pharisee who persecuted Christians before becoming one let me tell you Brothers there's there's absolutely nothing that can hold you back from the will of God in your life amen amen foreign that's all it takes to be a man of Baylor amen you know Gideon I I see himself I see him when he when the Angel appeared unto him until and he tells him a mighty thou Mighty Man of Baylor all of these thoughts are coming to his mind they say he he's not qualified to do that you know how many of us think of us that way sometimes that we think that we can't do something that God has asked us to do I like to close with this with this message and the message of God be with us then where's all his miracles and he called him the man of Valerie Valiente and he said that God was going to do this thing and he said God is with you he said then where is all his miracles if the supernatural God is here where is the supernatural works of God that could be easily said tonight amongst our churches where is that God that once lived did he die is he gone is he pursuing is he off on a trip no sir he's the same yesterday today and if we say we are of God then let's see where God is let's see the signs of God is this Tabernacle stands for God The Voice of Truth Tabernacle stands for god let's see God moving Among Us these Souls being born in the Kingdom um let's see lies being trained up let's see the sick and the blind the Devils let's see his mighty Works being performed God is inner Mythos you know and God is telling you tonight peace be unto thee fear not notice saying I am with you I am in you Thou shalt not die amen amen God bless your presence [Applause] God bless you're happy to be in the house of the Lord este Edition starts out that Gideon was around 50 years of age I'm a little horse Brothers don't try and run from me I was taking a pill yeah and I wanted it almost to run because it was burning my insides I feel a little better so I could speak the problem is is here Brothers who was the problem gideonitas or the medianites what was the problem that is the question what was the problem in our in our picture that we see it wasn't the media in our lives it's not the devil sometimes we blame the Devils the devil has nothing to do with it what was the problem what problem did Gideon there was a self-esteem problem he found himself in a place they call it is a mighty man of Valor that's how he told him what's that you know a coward cowardly that was hiding now the problem was he doesn't say it here this is here in verse 13 it says if the Lord is with us why has all this happened to us the first thing that we do it's to blame the devil there's no problem you're going through tonight but I don't know if you've gotten to the point in your life that you get tired you get tired of the devil stepping all over you I get tired I get tired of the devil always of myself in what way in your mind sometimes you don't want you don't want to do bad things there's something inside of you inside of your heart says that there's a soul do something for God in your mind there becomes a battle in here to beat us there yeah and the problem is that we let it go down into our hearts the problem lies there is and he says Where are all of his uh which our fathers have told us saying look he says forsaken us and he has delivered us into the hands of the midianites look God never left them okay okay Brothers I don't know if that no matter what the cost is the most tremendous part is that there was God Brothers yeah that's right amen it doesn't matter how far you've Fallen it doesn't matter how far you've Fallen I have the news for you tonight God loves you doesn't matter how you are saying if there's something in your heart is [Music] but if it's still there and today is your day I want to be with you amen but here's Gideon blaming God when he was at fault this is then he said ah my Lord Israel what shall I save Israel yeah behold my family is poor in Madison the word Manassas means to forget he's been forgotten now my question is who told who told Manasseh but all of these things that he was telling the angels that he was poor sometimes we do the same thing sometimes we put our own self-esteem to to the ground sometimes we can't see with these eyes how precious lady before the eyes of God and it's a sprout from within you I'm going to be closing with this Brothers foreign look captain Cristiano are you a Christian now that question is for you it's for myself talking to you about it whether or not you had an experience that you're sure today if God calls you home it doesn't matter sometimes we think just because it's sad to see a young a young man of 14 years of age in a casket Cristiano and he says are you a Christian and he says I was a Christian El dijo you said yes sir I know he said look captain now think about everything look you better think fast because you don't have much better but think about it all the way to the where you left Christ I don't know if there's here a person I'm not talking about religion I'm talking about if you've left Christ at some place you started very motivated but there came a point where you grew cold that coldness it came into it that's what I'm referring to foreign [Music] and start right there you miss MO foreign how many times have we not left him Brothers and he's always there waiting for us brother John told it to us the other day that he was waiting there for you brother John and how many of us have left him we've been bad to them but he's there in this moment foreign [Music] [Music] he says now maybe you left him on a Doctrine in the Bible something that said to you thou shall not steal and you ignored it and moved ones you will not lie you ignored it and moved on one thing or another that you shouldn't have done is you ignored it and went on now you have to go back and start from there again so that Captain was bleeding internally and his blood was spurting into his eyes and he was breathing very hard and he knew that he was leaving he said you'd better hurry up after a while and he said I yeah I remember I remember exactly where I left off I said all right Captain start from there start from there once again foreign [Music] [Music] I pray the Lord that my soul take imurio and he died foreign that's where you that's where you have to find him seek him where you left him let's pray Heavenly Father [Music] if there's a soul lord e this evening that's forgotten about you did you go to that heart a Las puertas and that they open the doors of their hearts that you enter into them [Music] and that you return that first love to them love you Lord and thank you thank you for the good that you are to us that's how you were when the people of Israel

the foundation of the world God knew this time God knew this Tower he knew you would be sitting where you're at he thought so highly of you said that he blessed you with his presence tonight because if you came tonight expecting the greatest no expecting the greatest Grande that God has then that's what you'll get tonight God told the prophet yet the people to believe and I believe our brothers do that tonight do you love him let us read a scripture here real quick Romans chapter 11. Romanos capitulo verse 33 verse oh the depth of the richest both of wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable guanine are his judgments and his ways is what a beautiful topic tonight don't go anywhere musicians the word's been spoken what a beautiful topic because here's Gideon I want you to get this tonight because us ministers sometimes we are the We Are The Faults but we're not gonna do that tonight because we come and we say how many are down and realistically if you were borderline if you're like right in the middle sister of feeling good or bad now I just pushed you a little further down so we don't want to do that tonight but the scripture says yeah how many know the death of God how he had that experience in one day you got to know him that there was no more sin there

Grande this is the realistic thing he said oh you're talking to me he says he looked behind him is he talking to me that's the way it was that's the way it is most of the time we forget how great God is the prophet that God tells us the Greater Works great works that I do la soras amen what great works mayores what grade Works que Hombres Grande many times we want to look if we want to see Miracles we want to see the sick Hills we want to jump up and down but that's not the Greater Works that's not the Greater Works those those might be His blessings that might be the cherry on top that might be the whipped cream that's not the greater word because Gideon says then where are his miracles but the prophet of God he gives the interpretations where are those miracles there's only 10 people saved in the room come on church is this all that says where are his miracles are you lost are you lost take your seat searches it's got to be a personal walk between you and God individuals
