congregation and we are we're happy for the life that she lived and the example she gave is I believe it also goes with what we are speaking about the patience the and then there like well understanding the the stage that we are in desperate to go wake up to the moment that we're living in sometimes we're so occupied in doing things that we don't we don't detain ourselves we don't stop we don't stop to think what we're if we're doing really matters our mind is so occupied doing things that if we don't stop and analyze our lives and we ask and all this is am I truly doing what really matters because if not one day we will realize we might have that it was not worth it Lord paying attention to what you want me to do Anton says then I I want to pay attention I want to listen to what God is saying and I've got sentenced this this lady and God wanted to take her part of our Lives I want to pay attention I want to stop [Music] I don't want to just let this go bye and think oh I have other things to do what God is doing and speaking so I'm going to ask for the Fidelity and speak some words of sister Margarita is to meet her afterwards has been here God bless you I said I wasn't going to cry but the good thing is I'm here in at home yeah you know me it's difficile it's very difficult um to partner to see someone leave that you love it you know foreign is left or she died because of a short time of Separation The God decided to take away my mother 's grandmother with her uh but I want to thank everybody in One Way or Another you treated her well we go to the barbershop we'd go together you would share stories with me and you're one of the things that I see of her I just share this so you just know the caliber of of of women that you were speaking of is this happened in 1997. when my father passed away I remember they were difficult times for for me as a person since my father passed away I remember it was very cloudy it was a hurricane many people passed away and one of the things that impacted me of my my grandmother is this that I will share with you yes she suffered very much she was a mistreated by her husband in many ways she was mistreated yeah her husband had a a lovers in the same around the same place where she lived I would be his mother in one place a little bit higher than that my grandmother or my grandmother would see my my grandfather just go by and he would see her she would see him go by with with his lover that's what she was very saying position [Music] but one of the things that impacted when my father passed away I remember we're going up a little higher when my father lived up in the area where we lived and my grandmother and I even most famous [Music] and where the hurricane went through and everything is a lot of water going through the streets the water was very strong and I remember as if it was yesterday I was very young a person was coming towards and it was the mother of our brother adelpho IR I remember that she approaches now remember a lot due to that and that lady approached my grandma and my grandmother approached her and I remember my grandmother asked her for forgiveness that has been mistreated is [Music] I want to thank everybody let's see it through my grandmother I could talk very much and I'd like to through this means Hermanas all the sisters and take them for what they did when my grandmother was here living is God bless you may the Lord bless you Brothers [Music] thanking each and every one of you um thanking our Lord Jesus Christ for giving me the opportunity the great privilege and honor Ado to be able to be raised in a home of a daughter of God when you are happy with being familiar raised in a rich family or maybe Sons or Daughters of a king I'm happy to have been raised there where a son and daughter of God was I want to thank my lord for that I think the people that a smile a hug when she was here with us to thank you for that um we're very close to her you know yes one of them was our sister I want to thank her for what she did for my grandmother I'd like to thank my wife she wanted to go to Disneyland my uh my wife she took the time and took her to Disneyland and I want to thank you for what you did for her I'd like to read a scripture in the Book of Revelation 21 verse 4. this is the scripture says like this foreign and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away um my grandmother margarita Corazon she had a great heart and she adopted us as her own children she loved us to take care of her children a little girl yeah I remember a little a little girl a little baby she adopted her as her own she raised her ass and she loved her he is our uh our sister Rocio she had such a great heart okay foreign that she could raise us she didn't Prosper because if she saw somebody that was in need she would always let them borrow or she would just give it to them that's why she didn't prosper in business she was a great woman her last days the ones that were around her would be able they were able to see the angel of the Lord before her and that confirms she was the daughter of God when she was asked she was ready to go with the Lord so it's not a single doubt in her heart she said I'm ready foreign she was a great example for me um as my brother said if we are here today is because one day a woman like her stood up for God and as Paul told Timothy a circle as I saw of faith in that woman that was not that was not a fake energy and and that woman was that type of thing a faith that was not uh may the Lord bless you [Applause] foreign [Applause] the Bible says we have a great cloud of witnesses that encourages keep going it can be done why could you are going to be able to as well that encourages us to continue fighting the good fight and finish the race almost uh let's change it up a little bit we're going to enter into the Sardis Church Revelation 3 1 once again we're in the fifth Church the fifth Church the age of Sardis the time of the Reformation the time of Martin Luther where the Protestants were born and the seed that was founded by this nation that this nation created that created this that created this nation is and unto the angel of the church and Sardis right these things said he the the hath the seven spirits of God uh I want to focus on the seven Messengers in the seven spirits this evening the random tells us seven spirits speak to us of seven men you see them in Revelation 4 and 5. they're the seven angels to the seven churches this is very evident that the word they refers to men aura Associated spiritus those seven spirits and Seven Stars I want you to notice this is two attributes but also tells us in the stories that the Bible also also mentions them as seven eyes it only mentions two things of them spirits and the Seven Stars but they're also seven eyes and also seven lips it is very evident the word they refers to Men of course there will be anointed it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous Ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men in other words it's only one Holy Ghost but in seven minutes there's seven manifestations they're not seven different spirits but seven different anointed or commissions you can read it again it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous Ministry of the similar spirit in the lives of seven men they say the store was meant to reflect light at night for the Sun they all did this through the holy ghosts so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of God working out the will and word of God in different Generations I would like to take the moment to see why God mentions them in this age why he brings This to Memory in this song what does this have to do what's the status yes because we're starting the virtual patients that God has an anointing for each other in other words God gives each age what they need for that age he said Paul for the age of Ephesus for the spirit church God knows God knows we'll go through different stages in our lives in the spiritual churches they didn't need a poem in Iranians with each and every one of us he says God knows what I need Raptors today back to the original word of God yeah in the time of Luther is and you were one of them that said something preached at something higher something something stronger usted you would have put a Luther aside you would have said what a simple message he's the messenger of all this churches so just sell him by faith isn't that what we do many times in a very simple message that wasn't for me yes something else the God is not in Rush before I can give you more the seven Messengers they did not give the same thing it doesn't mean it was the same Holy Ghost Santos from Paul to Brothers that's too high others say that's too low this is exactly what you need I mean if you think it's high or low oh this is each one of them [Music] Dios Liberty service God anoints the Son of God or the the man of God that is placed under the guidance of God to give the church as they need that's what God is telling to start his church age I am the eyes and I see what you need is correct what's the correct nutrients in order to give you to in order to get you to the stage you're going through right now we are many times brothers that we want something else we think we need something else I know what you need to jump to another state yeah when I'm not even at the first step yet [Music] la casa is I think the greatest ignorance there is ignoring where you are at foreign because if you ignore where you're at if you don't open your eyes to the place where you are you you want you won't know what you what you know you think you know but you're living in another place [Music] it's not enough for them foreign [Applause] brother Brown there are preachers Better Than Brothers Hallelujah hello this message is a rapturing message to the messenger of this age yours God is saying it gives you Direction how am I going to do it how am I going to get there following the star [Music] according to what the people around foreign [Applause] they will show me a living Christ [Music] who cares if it's a Luther an that's what I need if God sent me a message maybe that's what I need that's what many of us need foreign out there you say but God says today today John 16 12 says John 16 12. I have yet many things to say unto you said the Lord Jesus but you cannot bear them now you just had more to give them but it wasn't uh because it wasn't that right they couldn't they couldn't take them in Mysteries we haven't even arrived to justification many times matured yet then I can give you a little bit more the prophet continues saying the last paragraph this is as this same Lord identified himself with man in the Incarnation is again identifying himself with the man by his Spirit within him man speaking of these seven spirits he says these are my these El Senor human minds they may not even seem to qualify [Music] nevertheless they are The Messengers for their age use the Moses he murdered that's what they needed okay didn't baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that at the moment that's not what the people needed it's not what they needed so as we get upset here at church it's preaching too simple um some get upset because of that is he's angry that's what you need don't complain this is perfect I never told you I was perfect I didn't put myself God placed me here I didn't butcher here I didn't put you here I'm not begging you to stay here I gave somebody more perfect with God all right [Music] glory to God that's what patience is about the God has me here for a purpose to pay attention so what God wants to tell me today what God wants to tell me today me today the service will be what you make of it yes Brothers sometimes God won't move the mountain s God won't move the mountains God's telling you to climb the mountains [Music] what I'm telling you sometimes the only way it's mine of yours sometimes the only way to uh shorten our trials is they lessen our trials shortened is to lengthen our patients sometimes the only way shorten our trials is to lengthen our patients sometimes the way to lengthen our trials is to shorten our patients the shorter our patients the longer our trials because God says you're not paying attention is you're ready to go to another state I could take the trailer away because you're not paying attention the musicians can't come forward numbers 21 4 says is and the journey from Mount hor by the way of the Red Sea to Encompass the land of Adam and the soul of people was much discouraged because of the way and these people speak against God in Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness but there is light bread God wanted them to eat light bread and they didn't want it that bread had everything they needed although it was light it's not a preaching is not the voice is what's behind that voice shall live by faith [Music] shall live by faith anybody that received that message would be in the rapture without even speaking about the Rapture could somebody understand that is to be in the resurrection and go in the rapture how tremendous is our God [Music] if you would please stand [Music] they say he says when they became impatient is the Lord sent them fiery serpents serpientes fiery serpentes and most people of Israel died foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] why don't you receive it thank you [Music] and they complain they became impatient and God said you know what to say so you can have something to complain about I'm going to send you some serpents you don't want to give you uh receive what I want I want to give you okay you don't want the man that I sent you [Music] foreign [Music] stay still yes wait on God [Music] sometimes that's the hardest thing it's classic kit it's to stay still when it appears like God's not doing anything it seems like it's the most difficult thing is to wait on him foreign [Music] of our faith [Music] I don't know what stage but one thing I do know is that God is trying to speak to you and tell you something don't think that he stops speaking so then he stops doing but he's trying to do something right where you're at maybe it's not what you want but it's what you need and the best thing we can do and tell me Lord oh see oh Lord are you gonna say yes help our church help me Lord oh Lord help us to hear the voice of this day nothing greater than the message [Music] what are we doing I'm hearing what we want to hear [Music] through the vessel you sent me [Music] [Music] oh God [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] your soul we've always okay [Applause] bingo [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] [Music] they decided [Music] I've always [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's always [Music] [Applause] [Music] gracious [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you're welcome [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] recovery that means foreign [Music] I know that God's Gonna bless him [Music] it's how we give it it's how we give it so that Jesus seen how they gave me and the Bible says let's do it it says to do with joy [Music] with the cheerful heart in other words because he's done so much for us not because we're going to receive because we've already received something amen in the evening [Music] homes or you'd like to be remembered you can raise your hand my good and loving Heavenly Father we first want to give our ass forgiveness or any wrongdoing or evil that we may have done throughout these days we also give you thanks for allowing us to be
