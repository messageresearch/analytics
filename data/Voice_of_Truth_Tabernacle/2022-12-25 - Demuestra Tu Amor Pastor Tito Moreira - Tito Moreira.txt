foreign hands our mouth amen amen only four five believe it that's more than enough I came for Him Luke chapter 2 verse and it came to pass in those days uh there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made by cyrenius was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went off From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Jude unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David parakeets to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child yes and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for themes and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night yeah [Music] and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory three of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be good to our people is Born the day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and there shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger multitude and suddenly there was a there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying Glory adios glory to God in the highest and on the earth peace Good Will toward men amen amen let us pray foreign you may be seated foreign Romans 5 8 says what Romans 5 8 says well God commandeth his love toward Usos now there's a reason why he says command This is Love toward us that while he were yet sinners Christ died for us we are not the scriptures for God so loved the world que mando they sent an angel to speak to us of him that I cannot no right it says that he gave him he showed his love that's what we want to speak of this morning but the title is actually show your love cantamos cantos we sing songs all the time about going to heaven if I ask you how many want to go to heaven um and we speak about going to heaven and one day we'll depart to him for as much as we strive to go to heaven God strives to come to Earth he's not so weird of us going to he's interested in having coming to us the Lord told his disciples When you pray pray this way the same Bible shows that's what happened the first Christmas Los Angeles landed on earth when Jesus Christ was born in that Manger Santos well planned foreign [Applause] [Music] that showed his love so he said I can only give them words show his foreign the life tell me those 30 years weren't important it was 30 years of living the life without no one knowing who he was he should a gift we know he spoke about this yeah they followed his parents that God gave him as tutors with no interest of showing a public Ministry how tremendous I want to tell you this is love is not love unless it is shown Mark 12 30 says and with all thy strength it speaks of a complete love a complete love I want to tell you that the true love is a complete love a real love I'll give you this but not this part of myself I'm going to think about you but I won't do anything for you God says if you're going to love me I want you to love me with everything that's in you and everything that's outside the Bible says he wants our streets people think they can come to church simply come and listen yeah not enough if you in the beginning do it that's fine I love God God that should be to our Lord I love you God I love you no one saw me that's the way we are people that don't show our love that's true we're secret Believers

you at a distance I heard a story about a man they say he loved his wife so much but he crossed the mountains for him that traveled the Seas he spent years simply escribiendo writing de Legos from afar cartas letters to her he spent his time in the mountains and in the seas sometimes we think we're showing our love but it's a distant love God did not love us long distance long distance right Thou shalt love the Lord thy God repeat all Allah this is the first Commandments Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor there is none other commandment greater than these as we fulfill these two commands we fulfill everything as long as we pay we pay all the debts you pay everything off [Music] don't do that this is the way you love him now there are different ways but we get stuck in one yes speaking
