after him it was us take your place I don't like that you left the towel on the floor next time pick it up forgive me that's all my dirty clothes let's make their life easier when it's time to be in the kitchen let's do it but some of us are still a little chauvinists to try to make the burden lighter planets our fullness the quality or state of being full with completeness okay remember we're all on a ship foreign you're twisting in God amen amen so the prophet of God says in the message uh I Hebrews part two questions and answers messenger says okay we're speaking a little bit about Israel says I understand that in the morning you're preaching the last days when the flag raised in Jerusalem as going down of the Sun that afternoon the angel of the Lord appear here in the United States at that time when you see the Fig Tree and the rest of these trees putting forth Amendment Amen brother Anton says um says now did you know that the Jewish flag is the oldest yeah uh bordos Mill años masqueso and it's been Lane Dorman for two thousand years about 2500 the Jewish flag that six-point star of Davido never flowed for 2500 years since the carrying away of Babylon and now because the Roman Empire took them over and the Messiah comes and they rejected it they said and they were scattered to the four wins of the years but did you know on May 6 1947 that flag come back

tell you something brother God will do whatever he has if you're predestinated a member from your family he won't do it because he wants you look for life I believe they're the scripture that says or daughter or son for my sake not sick it's not worthy of me sometimes eminence what comes first yeah she had a husband that guided her this way and that way and one of the schools down there then it says she was no more hooked to any organization so she was ready now to hear the word of the Lord a woman meaning the church that her husband the organization died and she was just barely thinking
