have to not and we don't have to you I think that's what the devil tries to tell us and confuse us that we have to okay there's a price that has to be paid it's already been paid amen let's go to the word of God [Music] and it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am I God to kill and to make alive that this man doeth sin unto me to recover many of his leprosy wherefore consider I pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me okay is and it was so when Elijah the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying Warfare has thou rent thy clothes let him come now now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel I and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israelites let us go to the author of the word Amado what more can we say but thank you by grace alone so we stand here together it's not a coincidence but it's up to the one come seeking thirsting Hungary ambriento in the right mindset and like the solo mental correct and then the correct atmosphere we create our own atmosphere fathers in this evening we want to create an atmosphere with you but in order for you to be in it so tonight let's put our burdens our jobs our day-to-day things and right here right now forget about them we can't worry about them right now we can't put part about it right now because our eternal life depends take control of me take control of my brother and we ask you to take control of your people in your holy name we pray Ramos amen amen [Music] I didn't really know who I was preaching with but out of everyone I could have talked to about first about me speaking on Friday was my brother Enoch and how is it that he's the one I'm preaching with and that for me was God's confirmation yes that God is uh supporting him backing us up amen are you here do you want to be here who was forced to be here no one okay well there's one but it's okay it's all right sometimes of course it's a good thing that our parents push us to do things do good things do things we don't want to do sorry I don't know I don't know we don't have a title per se with our brother Enoch but no we didn't have time to talk about it but we're most about started I'm just going to Simply put a subtitle if I can say the correct approach correct the correct atmosphere [Music] this message is the way to get what you need amen this message it tells you what you need where to find it and how to get it that's what is the Holy Ghost and he has another message what was the Holy Ghost given foreign but why can't we come at it why do we come at it with a basic mentality a common thing a common approach I'll see what happens I'll see what it has for me only can a supernatural encounter with God can change our lives and this is a supernatural message amen amen that produces Supernatural things and why do I treat it like the common thing in my life tonight I know next week something's coming for us I don't think it's coincidence God put this in my heart and my brother Enoch share his thought with me and God changed my message why do I need to enter into the correct atmosphere correct why do I have to [Music] in a way really wanting it this we read in the book right now in second Kings chapter five we find the character of Naaman amen I don't know how many know that story though neyman was a man a chief a captain sorry of the Syrian Army amen and we know that name it had leprosy and again I'm just gonna summarize it and then there was a maid foreign and it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter that he rents his clothes and said am I God to kill and to make a life to recover a man of his leprosy parakeets I feel like many of us can find ourselves like the king of Israel almost thinking it's of us thinking that this message is has the though in this scenario that this message was directed to him or capture what I'm trying to say this letter was sent to the prophet amen it was not meant for the king but the only way to connect to the to the prophet of God was to send the letter to the king but many times you find like ourselves like the king of Israel thinking that it's up to us but it's not up to us we can't produce healing the prophet of God himself said it he cannot produce healing but it was God in him amen but it was the way he approached God the atmosphere the way he prepared himself that he was able to obtain that healing obtained that salvation for those that desire but again many times we forget it's not of Our Own Strength it's of gods but like again the devil that should help you in your situation I thought you were progressing in God and why are you finding yourself in the conditions because we must know and understand it's not of us it could never be of us because if it was up to us and Jesus Christ would have never needed to die he would have to do everything he did for us but we must come and recognize that we have nothing of ourselves we're unworthy [Music] atmosphere natural [Music] but don't look at me I don't know me I don't have nothing I'm just simply an echo our pastor's an echo but it's up to us what type of approach we come what type of attitude and depending on that attitude depending on their atmosphere that we created will depends will reveal himself or not to you now I want to go to the message the supernatural again I have nothing new to you but what I'm trying to get at tonight [Music] it's needed sometimes we go through things in life hardships to change our mentality to change our approach brother Brown says in the message of Supernatural he says notice this little lady she had told him to go to the prophet is he went over to the king foreign something that sounds sweet to my ears but we have a message that only through this message can a new birth be be made only a new person can happen through this message he says and the King didn't know nothing about Divine Healing brother Branham says are you with me are you understanding what the prophet is saying here and the King didn't know nothing about Divine Healing he didn't know anything about certain certain things well he didn't know that there was a prophet in the land that could perform Miracles he didn't know nothing about it though he was supposed to be in Israelites circumcised yes but you see can you stiff like a basic basic word but God deals with us each and every one of us differently many are called if you are chosen do you want to be chosen it all depends on what atmosphere how you approach this is if God shows himself tonight to you I can't do nothing for you it's all up to you it's all up to you this is directly to us continues reading and saying and when he gets to this letter he reached and got his garments and tore them up saying am I God to make man alive or to kill he said I want all of you I want all of you to take notice this man is picking Coral with me you see it thank God for a prophet yes he shows us more he says to the world it only tears him up he says see he didn't live under and I'm thinking he's saying under the atmosphere he was a professed Israelites confessed Malachi 45 believer but he thought that the days of Miracles was passed that we have an angel in this place that sacrifices himself every day to live in the correct atmosphere to live the right life for us to show us that this message still lives it's still alive whether you want it or not people but he says there's many people today if a prophet says that doesn't know that Jesus Christ is still alive I think that many of us it's me sometimes I forget that he's a living God they don't know that he ruled he still rules and Reigns The Prophet says they don't know that the blood of Calvary for all is sufficient is he purchased at the cross for our transgressions get in then why hasn't your life changed why am I a dog going back to my vomits eating the same vomit day after day there's nothing wrong with God's word what's wrong is with our attitude our approach how we approach it I come to think of The Prodigal Son nothing was different everything around it was the same the only thing that changed was him the scripture says he came to himself his approach his attitude he came in an attitude recognizing reconaciendo he was unworthy recognizing reconaciendo yeah he was blessed beyond all measure and that he had taken advantage of that yes that happens to us that happens to me I read this I hear this message hear the the prophets I hear his words and I don't take advantage I truly don't let it cut me okay cut me deep okay because only this message will show you truly what's wrong with you and it will tell you how to fix it and truly we've been here for Years yet I still don't understand I still don't understand it all I don't know well at least try to believe it try to believe it's for you put your ego down for one second I need to put my ego down for just one second and be honest with myself foreign everything God bless you [Applause] live in New York God bless each and every one of you um we have a time to talk about it we're practically in the same thought it is the most area layers is I like to read and if you just stand up so you could rest Second Kings five verse 10. this is like this is and Elisha said the messenger unto him saying go in Washington Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean in a month but neyman was Roth and went away and said behold I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call in the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper you may be seated yeah we find here in second Kings chapter five important a very important man that had won a position as a general the Bible says he was the courageous man without any opposition he had he was a man with the position but he he was a leper leprosy has always been something shameful it was something shameful for him we see that this uh this young lady and she told she told her her the woman that she served this is the name it goes to the king of Syria and he talked to him about his case he told her what the what this mate had had said to him and he sent a letter to the king of Israel Israel the king of Syria sent a letter to the king of Israel and we see the occasion house as our brother Reddit where the king of Israel says to heal this man of leprosy he is incredible he didn't know that he had a pastor he didn't know that even in his time the Divine Healing existed because he knew his life was in danger and the king of Syria could declare war he rent his garments when Elijah found out about this this is why have you tore your garments [Music] so he sends uh for naming to come forth and when Naaman comes to the house and and to the door of Elisha he has a concept of what is going to happen he has a concept of how God is going to work in him or how he thinks it's more convenient for him but when things don't happen as he thought they would it hurt his pride it hurt his ego per se and he became discouraged in cambiograce but in return he received a messenger yeah and this messenger told him to go to go wash himself in in the Jordan seven times and he would be healed of the leprosy even the response he received from the messenger was offensive to him [Music] there are rivers that are better than this cleaner but his servants they had a better Revelation than he himself did and they told him if he would ask the greater thing of you would you not have done it and that made him reflect look youth is that happens to each one of us throughout our lives we begin to understand no knowledge learn knowledge which is the the weapon of Satan it comes and as we are walking we begin to think that we know it all right and then you begin to challenge your pastor supadre your father is the head of the home and the head of the church is the pastor as when the scripture tells us remember your creator in the days of that youth is what we focus so much on the youths same mistakes that we made right we find ourselves here in this position here we're naming new nothing of the Lord he wanted to be healed but he went to the wrong person many times to ask for the wrong counselor or advice the Holy Spirit is a seed it's a seed plantando de Generations that is planted from generation to generation to another man of God foreign think for a moment yes is importante that's why it's important said the problem in these days is it there's so much yeah in church they go and they study La Biblia the Bible before being born again first foreign be born again see how important it is I said car say s to approach with the right attitude in the right atmosphere doses so here is name it is and he doesn't hear the answer he wants to hear I recall one time that a couple approached brother Garcia I do not agree with this relationship this relationship what joins you is sexual is is sex he as a pastor obligation the obligation to tell them to his members what he saw of the relationship through their pastor is more important it's very important imperative it's very it's very important when you approach the Holy Spirit through the man don't expect to hear what you have is an answer already what you're expecting for him to tell you imagine if we knew the future of the youth we will tell them but we don't know it is we can see at the present time yes that's how we try to help the youth and he goes and he washes himself seven times and he is cleansed of his leprosy because of the obedience to the pastor no to the word because the prophet is the mouthpiece of God it wasn't obedience to the pastor foreign many of you have heard my testimony there were things that I did not see of myself and when the pastor told me he who exalts himself shall be shall be humbled and you humbles himself shall be exalted he said I won't speak with you I wanted to speak with him he said I won't speak with you because I was sinned for you and this is how I'm treated father dedicated my life a life yes and then this is how I'm treated much feels I began to think of those same words that he had told me that when he said I was I was summing for you and then I understand it was the Holy Spirit speaking through him that had told me my condition because I did not humble myself I had to go through a very painful process seven years of my life wasted so that I could get to a condition where I can understand that without him I have nothing I thought I was yeah it was filthy rags [Music] out of it that's why youth is listen to the voice of God to the voice that God has given us the angel that God has given you foreign did if you would just please stand the story of Elijah is very beautiful the prophet says Elisha had a good teacher now one of us has an excuse a thousand times again seek first your new birth Andes but for anything else Heavenly Father we rejoice in your word we thank you for your Holy Spirit thank you for placing a pastor over us putting a rest upon us we have no excuse our need is the holy spirit put the youth in your hands amen amen [Music] thank you this person's here the altar is open [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh SI senior baby [Music] [Applause]
