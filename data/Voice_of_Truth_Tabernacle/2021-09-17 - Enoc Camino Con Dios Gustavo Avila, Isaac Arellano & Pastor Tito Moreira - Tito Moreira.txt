can we sing that song think about his love one more time think about it just think about that tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] don't think [Music] one more time tempering your mind [Music] tonight [Music] is [Music] [Music] it's a privilege to be here in front of you once again how many feel very privileged to be here because what a lot of youth don't have a friday youth service have a service dedicated to them and here we are on a friday night where we could be home relaxing whatever we [Music] now the thing is you come expecting something it starts off amen amen can we please open up our bibles to first or genesis chapter 5 verse 23. amen amen and it reads like this and then all the days of enoch were 365 years in and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him coming now if we go to revelations chapter two verse four please apocalypses capitulo dos versicolo cuatro once you have it you can say with an amen amen i want you to follow me amen nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left my first love perot say one more time with me repetition left amen when our pastor asked us to speak this friday escaminando and like i said god had been working in my heart about this already this friday uh today's service i was going to sing a special este servicio este is take me back to a place where i first received it that's where many of us as young people come he wants hombre uh only now he only needs one scripture but in that scripture so much but inside that scriptures there's so much dent it establishes me to up to today that god can do so much with just a little bit much and the days like our pastor said why he didn't feel good casey didn't want to go but there was something inside of her inside of his bloodline [Music] the creator himself talking ablando conversating conversando and i told myself what type of relationship he knocked out with god the type of relationship that adam once had before classes before the fall and here enoch had it with god yeah what i know and i put myself in pongo i put or i placed this this this scene as like a relationship between a husband and a wife a young man or a young lady i'm not going to be talking about courting but in that sense of area again i i can't preach more than what i live you know and but this is an area where i myself have lived and gone through pero en estado you know that relationship should be with us you know you when you're with that one person that he had with his creator knowing what he did for him knowing what he did wanting to have fellowship even though knowing what his father did or his his father did his great great grandfather did it still god wanted to have fellowship that's amazing you know it comes to a point in our lives as young people if you haven't got in there but some of you will get to the point where you'll be able to start to walk you'll be walking alone if you stay with me i'm trying to get this point where uh you're gonna be alone in making your own decisions we all have that moment in time where we have the options i don't have my parents pushing me anymore you know it's going to come to that point and i asked the question i've asked myself this question where am i at with my relationship with god [Music] where i have that option juan do you think is the option of doing what's right doing what he wants and while i have enough strength to do what he wants me to do to walk where he wants me to walk that's what was going on with enos he was walking not by his own will that you aren't capable of doing god made you capable of many things but he knows what you're not capable of doing but he knows where he can help you to help you to get to be able to be capable to do everything and it's all in him and imagine enoch leaving everything aside such a relationship that he had with god and i return back to that his first love where many times us young people we give our hearts on too fast again i say this for me for me i've given my heart so fast where what i've given my heart to que lo que yo mi corazon or whatever you give your heart to look you suck that in which has it has possession upon you amen we have to get to that place where is [Music] he wants [Music] it's just you have to it's a desperation it's what you have with god that's going to take you back home and it was effortless to step from it was effortless from who doesn't want to be in eternity of love [Music] but i say again you must go back to your first love doste i need more of that jonas i want to have that daily experience the enoch had with god our prophet says in the message the mighty conqueror if you're here without christ tonight if you haven't got a real genuine experience an experience i want to ask you quiero preguntar there's too many church members today if you're not really deeply in love in your heart with christ there's no christ there he says christo could you stand can you take and stand for christ like that mother do it do for her baby it's that kind of it's that kind of a love in your heart that you'd walk right in the face of death or you can hardly testify do you really want christ in your heart like that quiet he's knocking at your heart's door el estato cando la puerta de corazones wants you to receive him just won't you just receive him just now no received implemented yo hey man amen if you could just please stand with me we're going to be praying heavenly father thank you for another opportunity in your house we're here because we need you lord and we know you are here because where there are two or three congregated in your name you said you would be amen lord thank you for being with us one more day and lord please take control and we ask this in the name of lord jesus christ amen amen man you may be seated brothers um uh god is here amen that's right i felt god working in my heart already since today started you know i was uh trying to fix this message and as i was fixing it i was picking scripture like this one yes and it's because uh the scripture is more penetrating than a double-edged sword and um i really don't want to preach this you're here amen quickly i want to give a small report of our trip in las cruces and it was a very humbling experience and we uh shared the subject that he has kept me alive surely the lord has kept all of us alive no we never expected to come this far maybe some some of us don't know yet why we're still alive but like our brother gustavo says we all have a purpose and a reason and first of all i want to give thanks and then i'd like to thank our pastor for keeping this congregation alive hallelujah hallelujah it's just uh it's very humbling it is [Music] quickly followed me to second genesis 5. and we'll be getting into the word now um when you uh verse 24 when you have it can you say amen i brought something short but shirley sharpe you know i was not prepared for it so i need a brave soul all right uh let's let's start with what walking with garden isn't it galatians 5 says cinco di this is what walking with god does not mean significant and i promise i was not thinking of anyone it says verse 17 of galatians 5. for the flesh death and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things but i cannot guess that you would okay did anybody hear that the flesh goes against our spirits and the spirit thank you in the spirit can we repeat in the spirit with god in the spirit now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these idolatry shall not inherit the kingdom of god and the more i got into this the more we find out how not to walk with god you know i could i could spend years just talking about one of these but what does walking with god mean galatians 5 brother uh giving you the answer straight from your bible verse 16 says this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh can you imagine enoch walking with his flesh or your and i'll continue reading there in verse 22. there is no law [Applause] have crucified the flesh let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking each other this is the lord speaking to me brother speaking neither the things that are in the world that's a big one this is for the youth since we always want a lot of things in this world think of the thing you want the most from this world [Music] offers lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth don't don't think you're going to live here brother no don't plan to live here don't say your foundation here brother there's a lot of ways things you lose things in this world because god is the only eternal one i wanted to sure something else but i'm i think i'm gonna close um i'd like to uh make parallel when mary and joseph maria jose forgot jesus jesus and and the feast of the passover says in luke 241 and lucas now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feasts we don't know the child jesus turned behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it [Music] and after getting your son for almost three days the bible says you're not noticing you forgot your son i i can't imagine mothers how panicked you would be to have been in the company sitting what i want to uh give you is that sometimes we think that we are walking with jesus we think we're doing everything right you know uh when i was in las cruces my brother diego shared with me that there was a brother that asked him to pray for him because his business was not being successful and the brother said that something happened and a long time ago much and he didn't do something with that so he had to go back and fix his mistake so that his business would prosper and we asked why are we going through this that's because we left jesus behind hermano gustavo gustavo comodi armando like brother we leave our first love you know we need to return to that and make amends because we like it says here mary and joseph returned comedy dominok he kept up with god el camino con dios so much that he said come live with me vivek i cannot imagine god asking me and i want to read a quote from the brother from brother brandon forgive me the message it was not so from the beginning now if we've lost that joy if we lost those things and we can't find them among our kindreds we can't find them nope then there's one thing to do to go back where we left him at and that's exactly what mary and joseph did they left jesus at the feast and pentecost now i say this due to our consideration and respects that's where both catholic and pro protestant left jesus yes i you can't find him searching around here through creeds and denominations go back to the beginning of principio back to we left where they left god bless you [Applause] hey man i'm in how many can say i can't walk without him caminar we cannot he was told brother branham if you would just preach these things a certain way we would give you our right hand of fellowship he said i don't need your right hand of fellowship i need his hand holding my hand i wanna i wanna it's going to be a challenge to get out of here and you're like man there's no way out well let me tell you without him you're not getting out it's going to be a challenge to get out of here but we have the way out he gave us the way out of here he gave us a way out of here enoch came out enough he was translated out because of the faith the it's a rapturing message we be walking to aldonde where is our direction where are you walking towards us we gotta be walking back to the word the only way to go back home is to go back to the words that's the only way it is it says that enoch walked with god that means he didn't stay still he was not still established he didn't get stuck that's what many of us don't understand our god keeps moving so the reason why god is putting challenges in your life so that you keep moving the reason why the mother eagles puts puts challenges in the in the eaglets start stirring up the nest she starts to stir up the nest you know and that's why he's making things difficult in our lives he will never force you but he will challenge you [Applause] get out of your place where you're at right now you know god is not look enoch and nook walked with god camino con dios 300 years ago that's how much he walked with god he left 365 the bible says he walked 300 to get enough transformation power so that he would leave this earth now we have to do it in a lot less
