tonight I'm thankful Brothers many who are sickness Brothers foreign foreign foreign and it came to passes when as they came when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistines that a woman came out of all the cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tablets with joy and with instruments of music and the woman answered one another as they played and said and said Saul has slain is thousands and David is ten thousands is and Saul was very Roth and the saying displeased him because your words are alive thanks to God we speak of predestination because he was called he was playing this is great for us also call tonight because God has brought you tonight I was chosen to share online when you believe it Brothers it says that David was a man after God says what satisfaction we have brothers be safe foreign Israel is foreign [Music] [Music] foreign Brothers God is good Brothers God wants to try his children so we can see our faithfulness to relax ourselves to take it easy every young man and young lady to have their experience with God if you have a feeling it's because there's a or if the reason is that the sister plays the piano version the brother preaches very well I want to be like that person no brothers Hermanos is [Music] God has counted every one of our steps God is good uh David had no education what the prophet says he took him out of the flock or from from God never departed from [Music] an evil spirit Came Upon sovereign but thank you and I believe it I believe that with all of my heart I'm going to be reading a quote from the prophet it's in the great warrior David they say nothing and it says he was elected yeah it was called he wasn't he didn't Place himself but God placed it he was elected he was called from caring for the Sheep to be a king that was anointed and placed look he says Abraham Isaac Jacob Jose Joseph Abraham elections perfection the election blessed be the Lord they say it says and then you you heard his uh you took heed to his call then he poured the anointing oil on you you all know that they say in a symbolic form amen amen I hope that you're able to capture them Fresco the prophet says that this came fresh he poured the oil on him and it ran from the top of his head down to the souls of is God is going to give us God doesn't give anything happens God is good Brothers that is how God he simply baptizes him with it oh hello anointing him with a spirit notice when that uh Spirit came on him he was positionally placed as a king Christ in Christ Jesus as kings is correct that is you receive the Holy Spirit he never consulted the prophets perfection foreign [Laughter] may God bless you foreign [Applause] verse 11. we're speaking on the great warrior David I mean hither and he sent and brought him in and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward through 45. adavi and the Philistine said unto David my dog that thou cometh to me with staves and the first time cursed David by his gods now notice this and the Philistine said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the year and to the Beast of the field then said David to the Philistines the armies of Israel [Music] we've read in the first part the first scripture Israel was chosen by the men so let's keep reading is [Music] amen amen foreign so he took his I mean his statue okay he had experience to challenge the the people of God is they would always say he would always come to challenges so I heard that the voices he heard that he heard that David said I will go and fight against this Goliath so Saul called him from a young person you're a fighter and don't say his armor his breastplate he is he said no no take this off I don't want to go with it I mean [Music] David said I will go and fight and don't say so he went he said you know let me go as I am he took his uh so he put him in his in His Garment his statue I mean the the Shepherds they had honey one of their sheeps got sick they would uh put that uh I mean they rubbed that honey on that rock on that stone and the Sheep would come lick that honey but he would also lick it is it's Jesus Christ when we have trials go to Jesus Christ our brother said David try to take it I mean before doing any Ife is and faith is revelation I mean Ife in English faith and English is five letters and now honey represents the word that is the word of God all the revelation of his words he was going to fight against David in the name of God so he he continued and he got that stone and when Goliath came or approached him he he threw it with that with that stone with the Revelation what is your problem it doesn't matter how big God is let's continue forward let's continue forward a little bit all here Hermano so then David went and killed Goliath I mean that the Living God and that's how they got more strings let's get it glory to God usually I preach in Spanish but but today I want to I want to truly bring out what I got but God bless you all hello I really truly miss each and every one of you I've been gone for a while but let me start by saying this without a soul there couldn't be a David we know how the prophet describes it we know without night we couldn't appreciate today without sickness we couldn't appreciate our health amen who can remind me the title of this of this theme yes man called by God you want to make sure you're all here they say your body can't be here you might can be somewhere else it happens to the best of us but tonight it depends on me dependent at me what mentality they bring What attitude I come with do I come with an attitude of expectations elected by God's choice he likes when people know what they're talking about no matter what age who they are where they're from the sand and by the grace of God we have this great message a prophet says that the scriptures have compound meanings so there's different ways you can take at it and tonight I want to bring in the character of Saul yes anointing upon someone because I was hearing a preacher one time says I'm a big man Spirit as soon as oh me look at me you know we we and we know in the in first Samuel chapter 8 is when the people go to Samuel puello as Samuel tells them what type of King they're gonna get is and if you go there in chapter 8 verse 17 this is Jesus for his army but I want to bring you tonight the type of David type of spirit that David has it said he was a man unto God's Own Heart and we can see election perfectly there because I started to think about that he started to say okay so if God saw something intakes it used you know it's not his heart right and that was the reason why he called him same thing for me that was worthy yeah worthy to bring out and maybe many times it happens to all of us we're humanos we know ourselves is but one thing is that we try to have the mind of God many of the times God sees more than we do and God always sees what you can't see look you said the great Shepherd El Gran pastor but again I go back I want to give you a couple examples of what God saw in David before maybe himself he never saw David knew that God was with him when I go back without a soul there couldn't be a David and without the devil attacking us day and night we're gonna find out we can notice what God's telling us why we're here you may say oh he called my parents oh my parents moved here it was never me it was never mind we ever thought maybe God called your parents to get to you who are you to say how God works he could have looked over me many years ago God bless my brothers what an amazing job they did you know but we look here in this in this scene now I'm going to take you are you with me here tonight I know maybe maybe some of you are thinking about what's going to happen after that but my God loves to work in this order and if you're expecting something you're gonna put God in a time frame is to David behold my elder daughter yeah who will I give thee to wife only with be thou Valiant for me and fight the Lord's battles and then it says but in the new king no King uh New King James Version it says let now my hand be upon him but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him so I had upon him and then look at the type of David now I believe each and every one of us have inside of us again throughout all the characters in The Bible to bring out what they had inside of them a time of pressure a hard time what is my life my father's family in Israel that I should be son-in-law of the king foreign samosa Amen to show what truly you have inside of us because you have to believe it first what you said you have to believe it no one else can show you you know no one else can tell you where you are only yourself but it's in a sense of way it's also up to God and if it's in your heart's true desire is to see a part of God inside of you and God will set up the situation the area well he will show you that part of God is that David inside of you if we keep on going it says again in verse 25 now in the same chapter and then I want you to follow me shall ye say to David the king desires not any Dowry but a hundred foreskins oh forgive me I jumped ahead of myself I'm going back to verse 21. forgive him and now right here we can see that saw is about to give his youngest daughter it is I will give him that she may be a snare and at the hand of the Philistines may be against him Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law in the one of the twain speak these words in the ears of David and David said to you a light thing to be a king's son-in-laws seeing that I am a poor man and lightly esteemed is but I want you to look at this picture again a certain characteristic that we should all strive foreign a man unto God's Own hearts when they pulled Jesus but when the word of God says and again this is not an easy pill to swallow noise honor thy father thy mother all the days of your life again it's not easy but it's needed that was necessary of that anointing in which David had in order to do all those things my brother said it earlier that anointing the oil is represents the Holy Spirit and only with the Holy Spirit is can we break through those things true self-dominium but again of that anointing a change of a mindset change of Nature and only can we find it in his holy spirit and tonight I believe each and every one of us have been elected for a purpose this message itself is for an elect as far as because it says behold I will send you but can he says Elijah the prophet and Prophet Elias you who's you know so as me yeah the weapons the armor in which we have to put on Las amas come against us every single day throwing Spears against us so throwing things against us throwing us my things in our minds things and all your things things in our bodies to make us confused to make us now understand things maybe just believe the word of God the anointing in which this message because only in this message can you truly overcome in this stage it's the anointing which you need in this day I don't know if someone's truly listening to me tonight no say again but if you none of what is happening here is a coincidence tonight the church we have is not a coincidence the parents yeah I should not be here you should know not be here there are things in our lives that could have happened it's by-election esport election it's not up to you or me to understand it all no depends but like he said it's just believe it is you may not see it right away but tonight can you just simply ask God Dios I don't understand it all night I don't get it but there's nothing inside of me pushing there's something scratching inside my heart that every time I try to do something common I try to be common I try to be modern content I just can't fit in ain't no no identification it doesn't let me fit in pull that out of me show it to my face and if you challenge guys nuevas and he says this is you know religion has been given to us since we were infinite infinitos infants and we're baptized in the Catholic church and so on and so in foreign I come to the conclusion that it's not what I do no es lo que ago but that doesn't take away that I shouldn't do it I do in life and so and so do you Italian usted he says you do what you want to do but there are people in life that don't do what they want to do my pastors our pastor has said it before I was designed I was designed for this para Esto I was born for this I'm doing what I want your story is I believe David was doing what he wanted because he has something inside of him that pushed him to do what he did and if that's your desire tonight to be like David to have that self-control over his mind foreign that he licked that rock is gracious Heavenly Father Celestia your word has been exposed it's up to you now Lord I believe everyone believes in your word Lord Jesus Christ may you just come down every heart Lord hey baby

glorified amen amen okay I believe that like David we have many enemies David had many enemies I believe if a man apart from the Lord Jesus Christ as many enemies was David from all sides they wanted to kill him but he was the chosen one from God majority of Psalms David writes about his enemies something in David um Corazon we say the great thing about David is that he had the heart like the will of God his heart was like the Lord many times we believe songs but I believe one of the things the Lord loved about David is that David had no fear of his enemies a sanginario not thirsty um the first king Israel of Israel was so you know why God got rid of him he couldn't kill his enemies I heard his heart too much he believed it was better to keep the king of the and not to kill everyone who God told him to the enemies of the Lord he wanted someone who was not a coward you wanted someone who wanted to get rid of all those who came against the Lord he was a warrior kill the enemies just spoken against this God is when he was about to decapitate him I don't believe they gave him any weird feelings foreign he was fearful of cutting heads like the heart of God because he had no fear he had no fear okay he was not a coward and so so I mean that lets me know but if I want to be that way all your enemies we have to not have fear and God is with us amen Amigos who have enemies see has been recently attacked don't be fearful do not be fearful don't be friends with us amen ities [Music] Park that way the doctors don't know what the problem is for my wife who has been feeling well um and I
