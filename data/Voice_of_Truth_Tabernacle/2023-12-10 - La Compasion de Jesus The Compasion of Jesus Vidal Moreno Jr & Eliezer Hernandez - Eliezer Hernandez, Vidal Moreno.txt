good to be in the house of the Lord um we're uh we're preaching uh the theme for the services is uh you know winning souls and uh let us open our our Bibles um Matthew uh 14 14 Matthew 14:14 it reads like this and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick let us bow our heads to pray Heavenly Father we're so grateful this morning to be able to be in your presence Lord we just ask that you just have compassion on us Lord because we know that you do we know that you are never changed Lord uh we know that you know uh we know that you you still you still love us father because we're still able to be here Lord we still have that desire in our hearts Lord to hear from you father and we thank you for that Lord Lord we ask that you just speak to your people that you move in their hearts and that you touch them like only you know like only you can and we put this service in your hands may you anoint the lips that are speaking Lord and may you just help us all Lord this this uh us me and brother said Lord and our interpreters as well and at the end of the service may your Holy Name be glorified we ask this the name our Lord Jesus Christ CH amen amen uh you may be seated uh for a title this morning uh we uh we uh brother brother elas and I uh decided to title it the compassion of Jesus Amen uh and uh you know uh last week you know when I was coming to church in the morning you know I started asking myself uh you know what would I what would I be doing you know if I wasn't uh coming to church on Sundays uh you know I it was just a question that kind of just popped in my head as I was coming and uh uh you know uh I thought about it for a little bit and uh I I think that I'd be uh I'd be doing I I personally believe I'd be uh I'd be trying to uh I'd be trying to win souls to Hell amen amen you know because I'm I'm I'm doing what I can right now for Jesus I mean it may sound like it's kind of ridiculous but you know at that point you know uh we see some we we see that uh you know what you're what when Paul for example uh when he uh when he before he has his experience with the Lord you know he was he was he was killing all the Christians but then you know after his experience you know he had a transition get a complete 180 and uh he was trying to win every Everybody he could for Christ so you know I that's what I that's what I think I'd be doing you know I I asked brother Tito you know what brother Tito what would you be doing you know if you weren't here at church serving the lord and uh he he he told me he said uh I'd probably be an executive somewhere in a company but I believe he is an executive I believe he's an executive for the Lord you know Proverbs 11:30 it says you know the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winth Souls is wise and you know when you sit there and think about it you know winning Souls is a tough business it's not easy to win souls you know brother brandham says that the hardest thing for for a man to do is to believe another man so you know a lot of people think that uh you know people that go to church are kind of you know slow or or kind of dumb uh but but that's that's not true uh that's a lie uh because you know you have to be really wise I I personally believe uh that you know uh brother Tito could have been anything he wanted to be I believe he if he if he if he purposed in his heart to be a president of the United States believe that's what he could have been how but he chose a greater work he chose a greater work it is to win souls for Christ amen amen you know I was uh listening to a I heard a brother here a while back it was it was brother Donnie and he and he said this he said you know uh there's a when I leave this earth when I leave this earth he said I want hell to be uh to be having a party I want him to be to have a big old party oh when brother vial you know leaves this Earth You know when brother GMA leaves this Earth you know but you know a lot of times it seems like you know they're mourning in mourning because a lot of times there's people in church and they're the devil's best instruments and you know it shouldn't be like that Brothers it shouldn't be that way you know when when I leave this earth you know we should want hell to be in a great celebration H because you know brother Tito isn't here anymore you know that that's the way it should be uh when you're winning Souls oh when you're snatching them oh from the devil's hands you know but before we can do that we have to have compassion for him we have to feel for the people amen amen we should we should feel for them you know I was I was meditating and you know there was a great multitude there and uh you know Jesus you know he had he had a great desire you know a great he he felt for them for for the for the multitudes but then I go to uh Mark chapter 10 and uh you know in that chapter oh you know he's uh he's talking to uh one person there and it was the Rich Young Ruler and uh the Bible says that Jesus loved him and uh I believe that Jesus had compassion for him as well just like he had a compassion for the people that were hungry I believe he had the same kind of compassion for this man that had everything it sounds kind of uh it sounds kind of hard sometimes to understand now how could he have compassion for somebody uh that appeared to have absolutely everything it almost doesn't make sense because you know you see somebody that owns everything the man had a lot of businesses he had a lot of money but he had a lot of influence but he had all these things but Jesus still has compassion for and uh you know in one of the Gospels this young man he tells Jesus this in Matthew 19 he says the young man said unto him all these things I have kept from my youth what lack I yet so what what are the things I see here is that although he had everything he was lacking one thing and he didn't know what it was he didn't know exactly what he was needing oh you would think he would have been filled that he that that that he had everything that life could offer but he was lacking and Jesus had compassion on him too you know I come to a a a point you know where I I realize I realize that that Jesus you know he has compassion for all people you know and and when Jesus uh sees the the people and he sees their hunger he sees their need I want to keep reading on in chap on verse 15 Matthew 14 it says and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this a this is a a desert place and the time is now passed send the multitude away that they may go into the village and buy themselves victuals verse 16 says but Jesus said unto them they need not depart give you them to eat you see Jesus you see he wasn't the disciples were worried that they didn't have enough to feed the people see they were trying to send them somewhere else when when when that isn't that what we do a lot of times you know you send your kids to church I bet you you don't want to deal with them you just send them off it's nobody else's job you know to do what you should do you see Jesus said to go do it I so I believe you need to do it because he asks them they start asking themselves I don't have enough but Pastor said this morning he says you have enough Jesus gave you enough it gave you enough to do the job he gives us enough the problem is we try to have somebody else do our job and it shouldn't be that way he sends them off up you know he sends them to go get some food let's read verse 16 because Jesus was worried about them being hungry you see Jesus doesn't want you to leave here empty he he wants to satisfy your every need every need you have he wants you to leave here filled he doesn't want you to leave here complaining you know fighting or you see if you leave here like that I'm almost wondering if you didn't eat we come here to eat amen amen amen verse 17 says and they say unto him we have here but Five Loaves and two fish he said bring them hither to me that's he told me to go figure out how much they had so I my uh my question to you is how much do you have how much has God given you a lot of times were real sting we don't want to let go of what God gave us because we're just worried about what we need we're worried about what we want but Jesus knows what you need he knows what you need you don't worry about tomorrow or you got to worry about what Jesus told you to do we're so worried about tomorrow I'm almost wondering if Jesus ever did anything for some of us oh you know it just uh when I sit there and think about that oh you know I just I I just think about you know my my own uh my own walk with the Lord you know it was something you know extra special uh because I believe had never experienced that something like that in my whole life you know the the the the action you know that was taken just it's it's it's it's incomparable oh you know because when the Lord really saves you when the Lord has compassion on you when he feeds you and when he clothes you and when he gives you Joy when he gives you peace when he gives you happiness then then I believe you should be so happy I like you just can't hold it in you just have to express it you have to let it out you can't keep it in to much to hold when God has really done something then it just takes you it moves you are you want to tell somebody what Jesus did and may be little but give it to Jesus give it to Jesus and it'll be something great you'll turn that little thing into something bigu when you do those things that's when you know the the Lord really did something for you that's when you know you're really saved that's when you know that God has done something in you it wasn't something momentary it wasn't just something that passes by oh no it wasn't emotion it wasn't just sensation it was something else it was a passion it was a desire that was burning inside of you that won't let you stay still I don't believe there's been a thing in my life that has made me act the way the word of God does of course you know if you don't know my past a lot of people wouldn't know but it just did something to me it just touched my heart so much you know that I I I did things I had never done you know I I never thought you know I'd be a i i I'd sing for the Lord much less preach for him amen amen but he makes you do things you know it just touches you in such a way uh and and you know you just you just got to share it you have to share it with the people because God did something you see when he does those things it just it just tears you to pieces because you want people to know if there was any way for me to tear a piece of my heart out and be able to give it to my son be able to give it to my daughter be able to give it to my my to any brother I would do it I would do it because God I believe he gave me a piece of who he is that's what makes me preach the way I do that's what makes me cry it makes me cry for the people makes me cry for my wife makes me cry for my children Hallelujah it turns you to pieces when they gave him those love when they gave the loves to the people they had to be broken they had to be broken so that the people could eat I wonder how many people here don't feel Broken Hallelujah you know Jesus said I am the bread of life so if he's the bread of life who's the bread of life in this day who is the bread of life in this day it's the church because everything he was he deposited in the church when people come to you and they're crying for help they want you they want to eat they want what you have you got to feed them the sad thing is we act like these disciples we act like they we don't have anything we act like we we act like we Jesus never did anything the whole reason you're here is because Jesus did something Jesus has blessed you and I believe that when he talks to that Rich Young Ruler I believe he saw how great of an influence that man could have been he had influence he could have been somebody great but instead he was taking the people to hell you know there's people I'm uh there's people in hell right now that are more worried about about their loved ones than we are right now amen amen in the Bible uh there's a rich young ruler that after he rejects the leadership of the Holy Ghost the next time we see him and he's in hell and he's trying to do something trying to do something for the people but by then it was too late you see but he was worried he was worried for the people but it was too late my question is what about you what are you going to do for the people around you the people that you work with the people you live with what will we do with what God has given us lot of times we got to bear with them a lot of times we got to P we got a let them know that they're not alone we're not going to leave them behind a lot of times we got to back them you know I don't believe the lord gave me these shoulders just because I got to pull I got to pull with the pastor I got to pull with brother Al p with Brother P and we may be tired but God gave us enough he gave us enough he gave you enough it may be a little testimony but it's enough it's enough to win souls I leave you with this Andrew uh you know Peter's brother he only did one outstanding thing it appears like in the Bible but he did one thing he went to go testify he went to go testify he testified to Peter and that one testimony it changed the whole world it caused a revolution changed it your testimony you don't know of what it could do until you speak it with that I'll leave it to our brother God bless your brother VI if you can please stand presently in humanity worried about what's going to happen in the future many of the times Us in church we are thinking about what will happen really focus on what is happening right now God is making himself present right now now brother if we come to church take advantage coming to church I see some people that are worried more about their Ministry because they have to play because they have to do something take advantage of the opportunity that God gives them in this very moment the way you're standing I'm not but I feel something I don't know if you feel it tonight I'm feeling something there in Philip Philippians 2:5 if there be therefore any consolation in Christ sorry verse five let this mind be in you which has also in Christ Jesus you may be seated The Compassion of Christ Jesus had a compassion and this compassion was so great was this passion was so great and so motivated nothing can move him from his purpose know the devil Satan Lucifer Lucifer one day he was standing in his post of Duty and there in his post of Duty he began to say [Music] well this year will finish what what is next you're waiting for me what I did is not enough I want to do something greater I want to be something greater that thought is okay it's okay but he himself preached something still preached to each and every one of us and the preaching he preached that he himself believed is that it wasn't enough enough what he was doing he wanted something greater sometimes God gives us something so simple a position our duty so simple that we want to be the people who are over there in the front we want to be seen to be praised but this but this feeling wasn't in Christ the the the feeling that was in Christ was something something different and this feeling that was in Christ when he saw his creation what he had created Fallen Fallen brother God didn't make his creation to be fall God didn't make it for that brother brand the message identification when God looked upon his last creation his last creation after he had made it and fashion the way he wanted it brother says and I I like to look at it in its origination I love the outdoors because there that must be the way he wants he wouldn't have made it that way and we come around and pervert it and make something out of it that doesn't please him he says but his loving character molded it God saying that his life and his great plan and creation of mankind to inhabit the Earth and to live in peace and to never never to be sick or have a heartache or any worry or the way that the father provided for us and that was that was his desire do for us to be in that way us to be in a dying shape as we are this and the condition that the world is today is never the desire of mean that at all brother Brown was saying I was hearing this morning some somebody presently in in this earth and I know that brother BR could see the future somebody somebody weird in this time is someone that lives correctly that's how brother says it for the world today somebody who lives correctly is somebody that's weird you live with your wife you're not homosexual that's something weird but it's not for God when he saw his creation that had fallen it was his own loving character molded himself into the person of Christ God's own character of Love projected himself in the man Christ a story that I love so much to show that compassion of Christ that purpose that Christ had is the story of the Good Samaritan in the story of the Good Samaritan there's different people there and brother brother BR says we should find ourselves in his word each and every one of us should find ourselves in the word of God did you know that you should find a Bible character in the Bible that is similar to you so similar to you know because brother brother brah says that person we tell you who you are we'll tell you where you where you're going what is it you have to do well we see here the Good Samaritan but before the Good Samaritan had compassion of this injured man first there was this high priest that went through there I compare him with a minister Min or the preachers you know a preacher or a minister is his purpose is to serve the people that was his purpose to serve the is a public servant and when he saw this that was Fallen he probably said you know he probably doesn't belong to my church you know one time he did go to my church he was all drunk and drugged out he must have what he deserves but he didn't want to serve even though his per was to serve so he said well he doesn't belong to my family we are a family brothers and sisters we are a family are of the same body and don't tell me that if they step on your small the whole body doesn't hurt the whole body will hurt but this H this this Minister this preacher was without compassion but we see here a levite this l i see it as as that has a gift all the people that have a gift he was worried more about his gift he was worried about for fulfilling the gift that he had to help this person that was injured we worry more to be fulfillers of the church and to be fulfillers of our purpose in which God has called us our entire purpose God didn't just call us to come to church it's okay it's okay to come to church it's very come to church God didn't call us to come to church or to dress nice and put on a a tie to look good well even the devil does that with all due respect the devil does come to church too and he's here early it's not like brother Hernandez he's a little bit late no he's the first he's not the first one that open the door door but is the first one that touches or knocks on the door but we see this Samaritan and when we see this Samaritan the Samaritans nobody liked Sam wanted them close to them Heathen that that doesn't believe like we believe doesn't believe the message of the hour had compassion of someone that was injured and it says there in Luke 10 how is it possible that somebody can have more compassion than us I'm going put it simple how is it possible that somebody be of the message of the hour have more compassion than someone that says believe the message that brother William Baron brought what was the the feeling inside of Jesus that being in the form of God he was the Almighty he was The Great I Am he is The Great I Am for what is form m a manner in which something is made or ures to motor container into which something is poral that acquires a shape of its whole as synonyms are formation aspect figure appearance image configuration and structure so God in this great structure of God he couldn't do a lot for us religiously speaking us if we put ourselves very religiously we will do nothing for our brother or sister we will try to fulfill all the scripture in that form God could not help man we will be able to help our brother or our sister being religious because being religious we want to fulfill the law to the letters and we want somebody else to fulfill it too almost Force other people to fulfill before we do but this feeling wasn't in Christ so in that form of God so he didn't just want to be God oh everybody has to serve me I am an object of Praise everybody has to worship me no sir God did not we hold to our own way of living our own way we're very stubborn but God didn't but he let go of himself took a form of a being similar to man similar to ourselves why why did he make himself Sim but he couldn't because he could feel what we feel he had to come down to our level he made himself in form of sin not in sin form of sin he made himself man to be able to suffer like we cry like us do you feel maybe despised that they put you aside that they don't take you into account that's how the Lord Jesus Christ felt that same way the Lord Jesus Christ felt God understands each and every one of us God understands us but we try to get a hold of our of our old ways of living let me tell you that God has what we need Jesus Christ is our reward in the message identification no other nature could do it it was fallen and God identified look God identified himself as a man and took upon him the form of sin now well not sin but the form of sin that in order that he might take the sin of The Sinner and pay the penalty for it and give the sinner back the life that he had before the oh my what love God has expressed to us think of it now remember after Jesus doing this when no one else could do it we are invited we are invited each and every one of us are invited now Church think of this just a minute we are invited to shape our own character to his brother I don't know if it only happens to me I don't feel comfortable with my own character I feel like something is missing fight and fight and fight with your own character with the inheritance of your parents Jonah was someone that was angrier and there's a lot of M for any little for anything comes out goes out of its place and we get mad the brother's not doing what he should be doing it's done but we are invited to shape our own character to his by his grace we are invited think of it to become characters like his if we are ready to lay our character down and the molding that we had he highminded lovers of Pleasures more than the false accus and incant Des spers of those who are trying to do right having a form of godl denying the power of the word how can God come into a place like when they deny the word you watches over his word to vindicate to make it come to pass you may please stand God is making us that invitation if you're tired of your character if you're happy with your character God bless you I tell you sincerely from my heart I'm not happy with my character I want the character of to be molded inside of me the characteristics of the Lord Jesus Christ to be molded in me look I've tried many ways too many ways too many ways I've tried in many ways thinking that I do what's right and the only thing that I've noticed as brother Branham says that we try to appear to be something we appear to be great or big Christians or great Christians we appear to be many things but you know our life those that surround us know who we are we can't deceive them if you want to deceive yourself God bless you but you will not deceive the devil you will not deceive the devil we will not deceive the devil the devil the devil knows if we try to appearer something who we are we not or we appear to [Music] be we only deceive ourselves Christ is making invitation today not next year not next week not the next [Music] service today he's making the invitation heavenly father if any of your children accept this invitation that you have made to them that your own character come into our lives and mold father molding that's in us and take possession completely the person of the Holy Ghost characteristics
