land saith the lord and work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts according to the word that i covenaded with you when ye came out of egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not let us pray brethren sovereign eternal heavenly father we give you thanks your precious presence bless your thank you for everything and the precious the name of our lord jesus christ amen you may be seated we're in the subject the last days is or i just want to review a little okay of what we've been speaking on the last days hagar approximately the year 520. he was the prophet after zechariah with zechariah the people of judah in babylonia were captive in babylon in the year 8 865. and jerusalem and the temple were destroyed yes and even the government of syria reid persia the king of persia cyrus the king of persia that allows them allows the jews to begin the reconstruction they live and begin to rebuild but they never finished so the message of this prophet haggai is to aid to encourage them so they can finish building the temple of god the rebuilding of the temple estaba was halfway how many times have we gone through but a edifying quest that is only halfway converted with uh how that it's built halfway and that's abandoned there it looks uh desolate lonely inaudible it looks and how inhabitable to inhabitable that's how the temple was halfway done but the most tremendous was that the people vivian casa has been more important and i didn't come on fridays it didn't matter to me sometimes we give more importance to other things oh yes miraculous it's wednesday today no pasanada nothing happens it's midweek estoy but we're wrong you know i only work monday through friday muy buena every other sunday and you know and money mattered to me more questions that i didn't even take my pastor into account i came every other sunday one sunday yes and one sunday i'd miss i give things to a brother that told me why didn't you come on sunday and i explained to him and he told me in a good spirit you know brother yo i believe that if there is a job that takes time away god did not give you that job yes and that's true which has business many times i believe and left the lord's temple halfway and that's what the devil does said last week the most important tool of the enemy is discouragement you know why yo tomorrow this is how i take discouragement discouragement is like a drop of water sabi you know una gota de agua a drop of water when it falls in the same place up to a certain point continually that drop can go or pierce through that earth or stone in ancient times and they made a drop of water fall on their forehead a drop of water every every two seconds or every second yes i got that and that drop of water doesn't let you sleep other things can begin to come like energy loss like loss of interest losing your strength even discouragement can cause the depression depression yes and that's a very well used tool by the enemy that's one of the tools saiyan uses that's the tool he used with this animal he discouraged them what caused discouragement or what did discouragement caused it caused them to not focus on the temperament derailed their purpose that's what the enemy this temple well you know i wanna see even then okay although they were on or lost focus from the vision god did not forget them the lord's messenger in the lord's message unto the people saying i am with you saith the lord and the lord stirred up the spirit of zerubbab the son of the son of shaltil governor of judah and the spirit of joshua the son of jose deck the high priest and the spirit of the remnant of the people and they came and did work in the house of the lord of hosts their god yes there's our hearts that are sleeping i don't know if there's other trees or vines forgive me but if there's other vines they're false and they're temporary they're temporary there was against these barbarians these barbarians when this soldier and the army go to fight against them they have the greatest defeat of their life only a few survive among them this soldier this night he suffered a wound on his back and every time this soldier saw that wound those thoughts would bring back life even the edge of the blade cutting his back he could smell the blood he could see his his uh the people that were fighting with him being and their insides out and the time came where they had to go out again and fight the barbarians again he had two options la primera the first one he began his feelings began to speak and they'd say to him that's true hearts and he took his armor his shield and he was on the front lines of the battle and when he turns to his side elmira so he says many people just think that when they become a christian that's all they need to do that settles it forever and if they are christian for i become a christian to fight fight the good fight i became a christian in the battle line how to fight the fight and we can only do that as the holy spirit will reveal it we cannot take what some other nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas but we got to take our own ideas the way the holy spirit would direct us and what ideas he would give us and chief of the army of the christians god bless you [Applause] god bless everyone if you just please stand for a few moments um if you'd open your bibles it's bueno resources to uh second corinthians chapter 10. verse 3 to 5. the foreign it reads like this this i see this for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh it's for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ you see when i i just kind of want to talk about uh the battlefront for a little bit yeah the the battlefront or last you know and this goes exactly with uh the temple being built and why the battle actually stopped you see because when there's a battle going on you know because we don't want uh to lose the wars but if we're not trained then then we lose the war hey man amen but when uh nations go to battle uh there's uh there's actually uh three grounds uh that they they fight that they they learn how to fight on i trust people that terrence you see when jesus is tempted from satan uh we can go to first john 2 16. and it tells us the three of fronts that that uh that uh the spiritual war is fought on you know and you know i think we need to really pay attention to this uh because uh you know we're we're fighting the spiritual wars this is uh this is kill or be killed amen that's what i believe i believe that that the state wants to kill you and if and if you don't if you don't if you don't take him down and then he's going to kill you hello so you need to take down all his weapons and figure out how he's trying to defeat you yeah and the pride he took he took him to each one of these things and and these are the grounds that that he fights with [Applause] you know we have to learn how to defeat discouragement defeating discouragement is something we have to learn discouragement it's a it's like it's like for example like a python amen a man you see a python does it it slowly starts wrapping around the prey and supressa and he's just slowly uh you know slowly you're making them where he can't move a whole lot especially but you know the first thing that it does is that that it um it makes you a look look at look at it that's what that's what it does to its prey it like hypnotizes the the prey you know i was watching i was watching a snake one time you know i was at my sister's house and uh you know this the snake was uh it was after a rabbit and i was just watching it from far away the rabbit just wasn't moving yeah and i was like man why isn't that rabbit moving because because it was hypnotized you see and that's what the devil does amen completely [Applause] it's in the message the greatest battle ever fights and it says this it is that it says now before any battle can be put in a ray they first have to choose a meeting ground or a place where the battle is and then it says this in the first world war it was so placed in no man's land and places where they fought and there's got to be a place selected where they gathered aviona and that's where goliath came out and called to the armies of israel that's where david met him he's because you have to be mentally [Applause] they had this plane unavion and it was called a psyops plane yeah don't have your own psyops and what this plane did it was a it was a psychological warfare era uh you know of the enemy there an amigo and uh it would it would be it would send messages oh you know to to the to the enemy al an amigo that was on the ground and they would say stuff like this [Applause] there's an ambush and you're going to be destroyed and and you know and it was and then they would just say you would advance and just say that the army would keep advancing oh but i'm sure that many of the soldiers were were thinking on those messages and then uh as they continued to advance the that same plane that's my view it would just start scattering all these uh all these letters or or you know just a different stuff that they can read oh diferentes and they would read these and read the letters and it would just be like well give up now and we won't they started believing what the plane was was saying they would just drop their weapons and they would just put up their hands yeah they hadn't even begun to fight and they were already there's a [Applause] but the devil said the devil was telling him in their minds if god loves you so much why why is it why is it so hard why is it so hard to build this chamber if if god loves you so much you see if he was a real god i don't yes you know i went um i read second corinthians chapter 10. yes um i just something that that caught my attention was that verse four foreign you know what a stronghold is fortaleza you see it's it's something that um that we could say a strong place you cannot win the battle ganar la battaglia if you're always all playing defense defensive uh a team cannot cannot win the game if he just plays defense the whole time no my gusta you see i i i i i want to win your kid got knocked you know when i tie it i don't know about you but it feels like a loss i feel like i lost when i tied with somebody [Applause] satisfaction we're just living we're just living lives we're just maintaining that's it you're just you're you're just breathing you don't do nothing no i said no i think you start looking around and uh you just wish him for stuff hey man there's a there's a quote i like what brother wayne said this and i liked what he said you know take a it says this it says speak don't cry i've learned no comments to speak and go forward i've learned in march it [Music] i wish i had god is when he meets you should walk away okay is um entertaining those thoughts it's just taking all the blows and then you can't win like that yeah i don't want to just maintain no solo query i'm closing i just uh want to read a quote from brother branham and he says this esto he says every time when you start to make a march for god look out you're headed for trouble there's gonna lay right along the path there el diablo and then he says in verse 2 and uh in quote 29 he says the devil hates me and i know he hates you too my enemy yeah let's me and amigos as lying as god my friend i don't have no fear in him i just yeah that he thinks he's holding it he's got no strongholds he's absolutely legally defeated in every place it says the devil hasn't disappointed he's he was el nola vivio but god used him anyway to a certain point he he couldn't understand he couldn't see with his physical eyes [Music] [Music] what he was doing was wrong [Music] he [Music] a man that's that that didn't let us live a sanctified life if god could do that with a man [Music] jesus is [Music] [Applause]
