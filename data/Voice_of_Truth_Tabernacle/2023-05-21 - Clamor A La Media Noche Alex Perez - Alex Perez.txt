Duma mirambo says the burden of Duma he called it to me out of sire Watchmen word of night Watchman word of the night you're happy and thankful with God foreign it's tremendous when you see a man of God leave this earth there's a lot of thoughts crossing my mind now if I can give you something of that event we were uh presencing it's worth serving God when you give your life for this message and you serve the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ our brothers and receive plenty of greetings from the brothers it was a very pleasing time to be their presence we'll be speaking this morning thanks to our pastor for the opportunity we're speaking on the coming of the Lord and for a subtitle I like to title this message cry at midnight now you know Church is a crucial hour it's a very dark time it's a place where if you don't have lights you may stumble with something it's very dark all right now the Bible tells us of two Watchmen four off sorry four Watchmen and there was a time brother where in older times you know the cities were walled para protection of the people inside the city and as you might know there was always and we speak of foreign [Applause] foreign but you understand there was a certain time when there was a Watchman guarding or watching the city they caused my attention and we see brothers because when the time that we live in arrives when the messenger of Rh arrived to the scene he came at the evening he came at the evening time he arrived in a time where it was late the Bible says it was an evening time ages foreign program [Applause] foreign more than two thousand years he's still living he presents Jesus Christ to humanity are you following he comes with signs demonstrando demonstrating that Jesus Christ was alive that's our Messengers [Applause] it's alive for the world but the world received it not are we good brethren let's go this messenger had a process it's like we all have a process many times because maybe God healed us in our lives and that's good Brothers you shouldn't stop them continue onward himself to the US messenger came for the United States give the United States and the entire world speaking in uh on a global scale or his miracles for what he was doing when the messenger arrives at the evening time his purpose was only this is sometimes let's continue the years go by yesterday and this messenger is you know this messenger was evolving see yes and not advancing there's a problem we must advance foreign and this nation getting darker that's tremendous they saw the signs but they never saw the sign is Jesus Christ the Masonic sign Beyond brothers or more is happening but nobody wants to testify what's happening I don't know and we're sleeping here in church follow him hallelujah hallelujah we're not guided if I let myself by emotions I would not be here see yes reach it is because many things are happening out there there's testimonies to die brother there has to be a service of testimonies for someone to testify what God is we're just going to leave this Prophet notices that humanity is turned into complete darkness the time comes to the life of this Prophet Deke he identifies with something else see you should be identifying the same word of God de dios the Genesis go ahead and I said surely there's something in this word of God from Genesis to Revelation amen he wants to identify it was getting later it was it was getting darker and this word of God from Genesis to Revelation that's some character in there that you dealt with amen God was dealing with the prophets would be on the same basis that would be my question where people got tired of Miracles you know that right you know many people we answer questions what are you doing bring healing to the people that's what God called you foreign if somebody done something and you got after them then let me turn to that place in the Bible and if somebody listen whatever they done is don't fall asleep foreign

him he puts himself for example of the Apostle Paul and the ones that follow the Apostle Paul saw him in prison and said sir this is a messenger for us and present means to explain the present state of his ministry came where they said is this all means um the problem with us is we don't keep eating amen amen would die an explosion an explosion all of that you know 1963 comes and God reveals and
