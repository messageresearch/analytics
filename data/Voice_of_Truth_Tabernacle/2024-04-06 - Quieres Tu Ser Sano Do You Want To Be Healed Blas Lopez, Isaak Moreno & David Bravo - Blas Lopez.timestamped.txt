[24:13] name we're going to be reading the word
[24:17] brothers because time goes by very
[24:21] quickly before that I'd like to thank
[24:23] our pastor brother
[24:26] Tito those watching to the
[24:30] internet may God bless them wherever
[24:32] they find
[24:34] themselves and may God give them the
[24:36] desire of their
[24:40] heart we're going to be reading the word
[24:42] in the Book of John chapter 5 when you
[24:44] have it you can say Amen
[24:49] Brothers the word of the Lord says like
[24:57] this
[24:59] after this there was a feast of the Jews
[25:01] and Jesus went up to
[25:16] Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by
[25:18] the Sheep Market a pool which is called
[25:20] in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having
[25:22] five
[25:27] porches
[25:33] in these lay a great multitude of
[25:34] impotent folk of blind of Hall withered
[25:37] waiting for the moving of the
[25:57] water for an angel went down at a
[25:59] certain season into the pool and troubl
[26:01] the water whosoever then first after the
[26:03] troubling of the water stepped in was
[26:04] made whole of whatsoever disease he
[26:14] had and a certain man was there which
[26:16] had an infirmity 30 and8
[26:27] years
[26:32] when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[26:35] had been now a long time in that case he
[26:37] saith unto him wil thou be made
[26:55] whole the impotent man answered him sir
[26:58] I have no man when the TR water is
[27:00] troubled to put me into the pool but
[27:02] while I am coming another steth down
[27:04] before
[27:08] me Jesus saith unto him rise take up thy
[27:11] bed and
[27:12] walk the the theme of
[27:16] today would you like to be
[27:19] healed how many would like to be healed
[27:21] Brothers we're going to be praying
[27:24] now gracious good Heavenly Father
[27:30] We Believe Lord that we're here before
[27:31] your
[27:32] presence I believe Lord
[27:35] that you're here
[27:40] father and I ask you help me and my
[27:44] interpreter you help the
[27:48] audience and if there's someone sick
[27:52] here the word is telling
[27:54] us if we would like to be healed
[27:59] and I believe that the angel of the Lord
[28:00] is
[28:01] here we give you thanks for everything
[28:06] Lord Lord and Savior Jesus
[28:10] Christ you may be seated
[28:17] Brothers as we're reading here of the
[28:19] paralytic that was in
[28:21] Bethesda
[28:23] and the House of
[28:27] Mercy Mercy
[28:29] Brothers how many believe they've come
[28:31] to the House of
[28:34] Mercy how many want to be healed
[28:39] Brothers Here Brothers we're going to
[28:41] leave
[28:43] healed if you come asking for something
[28:47] tonight going to obtain it
[28:53] tonight this paralyzed man that was
[28:57] here his healing
[29:02] Brothers he was Desiring for someone to
[29:04] place him into that
[29:06] pool blessed be the name of
[29:09] the and I believe that we're in
[29:12] it no one is pushing us into it we have
[29:16] the
[29:18] [Music]
[29:21] word In this passage
[29:24] Brothers there was five
[29:27] porches and the
[29:29] historians they go on to
[29:35] say they say that there was a porch
[29:37] there that was called the the Sheep
[29:39] porch porch of the
[29:46] sheep gate there that was the Sheep
[29:50] gate and we know
[29:53] brothers that the Lord Jesus
[29:56] Christ is the L of
[29:59] God and I believe with all of my
[30:02] heart that he went through those
[30:06] Gates because he was the Lamb of God
[30:08] that taketh away the sin of the
[30:11] world don't you get excited about that
[30:13] Brothers Oh
[30:18] Brothers Here C there came an angel from
[30:20] time to
[30:22] time there many sick the word of God
[30:26] says God says there were many that were
[30:29] sick that were blind
[30:33] lame
[30:35] paralytics there were of All
[30:40] Sorts but they were just waiting for the
[30:42] troubling of the
[30:43] wat they couldn't see the
[30:46] angel they couldn't see the
[30:49] angel and I believe with all of my
[30:53] heart there are many people
[30:56] today that can't see the angel
[30:59] Brothers we have the angel of the church
[31:03] and many people can't see
[31:05] him we have an angel brothers who is a
[31:08] man he's a messenger brother who brings
[31:12] the word
[31:13] right so then
[31:16] Brothers they could only hear
[31:19] that when that angel would move the
[31:23] water we have the
[31:25] waters that is the word of God
[31:30] being
[31:33] tonight in the word there is heal there
[31:36] is
[31:36] Deliverance Brothers there is
[31:41] healing blessed be the Lord
[31:43] Brothers I don't know if you're
[31:48] happy many in that
[31:52] time they wanted to be
[31:56] healed but this man had been there 38
[31:59] years laying
[32:03] down now I identify with this
[32:06] man I identify
[32:08] with was also laying
[32:12] down I was laying down and I didn't
[32:16] realize I was
[32:18] lost and I didn't realize I was sick and
[32:22] I didn't realize it
[32:24] Brothers do you believe it
[32:26] Brothers but brother
[32:29] Brothers there came that angel that
[32:32] angel brothers and he spoke to me of the
[32:36] word of the Eternal Word of
[32:39] God a Deliverance
[32:43] Brothers blessed be the
[32:45] Lord Something Beautiful to when you're
[32:48] able to say I've been
[32:50] delivered I no longer
[32:52] live but Christ liveth in
[32:56] me blessed be the Lord
[33:00] the most beautiful thing you can testify
[33:02] is that you no longer live Christ lives
[33:05] in
[33:06] you now
[33:08] Brothers the people want to see acts
[33:12] they want to see
[33:15] acts I am in a process as
[33:18] well believe every youth is also in a
[33:21] process I always say this that I was
[33:24] young
[33:25] Ono I have youth at my home
[33:30] now I have to live a life to my
[33:35] youth say oh my dad is living the life
[33:37] for
[33:39] me and I can't live a it's not by
[33:43] God God is my motor my God is my
[33:48] engine blessed be the
[33:50] Lord Prophet says in the
[33:53] message in the
[33:55] message let me look for it
[33:59] because I
[34:01] searched
[34:03] because I always take a picture I don't
[34:06] my I'm a little old
[34:09] school but glory to God I have to
[34:14] learn the prophet says
[34:17] Brothers in the message
[34:23] perseverance he says Jesus went by the
[34:25] pool he looked around
[34:28] Brothers filled with love filled with
[34:34] compassion we know what love
[34:38] means we see it from a human
[34:43] standpoint we see it from a human
[34:46] standpoint he
[34:50] says filled with compassion for
[34:53] sure you're speaking of human
[34:56] compassion
[34:58] true
[35:00] compassion is to do the will of who
[35:03] Brothers of God mine but
[35:07] God's see there it is
[35:14] uh in two paragraph
[35:18] 203 Jesus went through
[35:20] there he knew the will of
[35:25] God he had just finished resurrecting a
[35:27] dead
[35:29] man remember what happened
[35:32] here he went by that
[35:36] pool he went by this
[35:39] side there were mothers with
[35:43] children they waited for the angel of
[35:45] the
[35:47] Lord for him to trouble the
[35:50] waters and he came by
[35:55] there and went to a man that that had a
[36:00] sickness let's say a prostate
[36:03] issue he suffered with it for 38
[36:06] years he
[36:09] was and that wasn't going to kill
[36:12] him do you want to be healed he said you
[36:16] want to be healed
[36:19] Brothers the angel of the
[36:26] Lord
[36:56] e
[37:26] e
[37:56] e
[38:08] believe of the the
[38:10] one that's all that's expected is just
[38:14] to
[38:16] believe on one occasion there was also a
[38:20] woman know the
[38:21] story she cried out brother she cried
[38:26] out one day I also
[38:29] C I shared with you a little bit of my
[38:31] testimony my son was burned a
[38:34] little and I would cry out in the
[38:37] hospit I would see him suffering for
[38:41] months but this woman only touched the
[38:43] edge of his garden and the prophet
[38:47] saids she came with
[38:49] something that many didn't
[38:52] have they didn't have
[38:55] brothers she was suffering for much
[38:59] time and I was like that for some
[39:02] time when I surrendered to the Lord it
[39:05] all changed
[39:10] now with god
[39:12] brother and that's why I'm
[39:15] here because I'm
[39:17] thankful that me being a
[39:22] sinner you know what the prophet says in
[39:24] the
[39:26] message
[39:30] everyone in the egg everyone is is
[39:33] similar they all look in the in
[39:37] the want
[39:42] get of one of
[39:46] those and here he got to this
[39:51] this I see myself in this
[39:55] picture I was in this picture Brothers
[40:00] begging
[40:02] Brothers like when the word says
[40:05] brothers that if we were to only
[40:09] believe of who this
[40:13] gift the greatest gift God could give
[40:15] man was his
[40:17] word bless be the Lord
[40:20] Brothers give the place to my brother
[40:23] now and God bless
[40:26] you
[40:35] God bless you Brothers how happy to be
[40:38] here amen you see talking about the lay
[40:42] man
[40:44] here I was seeing the difference between
[40:46] Spanish and English in verse
[40:51] six and in Spanish it
[40:53] says you want to be
[40:56] healed
[40:57] but in English it says wil thou be made
[41:04] whole you see brother brandham says we
[41:06] need to be made whole through the Mind
[41:08] spirit and
[41:12] body so Not only was this man going to
[41:14] be
[41:16] healed just from his
[41:19] condition but from his mind and his body
[41:21] and his soul
[41:24] amen amen we we all need that
[41:29] you see I was listening to something
[41:32] with um with my mom the other
[41:36] day and also our title is do you want to
[41:38] be
[41:43] healed and as a little subtitle I put
[41:46] take action or stay
[41:55] paralyzed but as I was was saying we
[41:57] were listening to a little motivation
[42:03] video and the guy
[42:06] says justice is when you get what you
[42:14] deserve Mercy is when when you don't get
[42:18] what what you
[42:24] deserve but Grace is when you get what
[42:26] you don't
[42:31] deserve amen see this man God Jesus had
[42:35] Grace for
[42:39] him you see I believe you know this guy
[42:41] as a young young man
[42:46] probably because this was an uncondition
[42:49] for 38
[42:53] years so imagine
[42:56] you
[42:57] you know let's just say you've been
[42:59] struggling with the
[43:03] condition I don't know since you were
[43:07] 10 you know now I'm 20 that's already 10
[43:13] years this man was struggling with the
[43:15] condition for 38
[43:20] years I want to relate it to a person
[43:23] that maybe gets in a
[43:26] wreck
[43:29] get hurt they can't do what they like
[43:34] anymore you see at first you're all
[43:39] upset might be
[43:41] discouraged or you might be you know
[43:43] seeking
[43:45] God wanting your
[43:47] healing wanting
[43:50] recovery but then there comes a
[43:53] moment where this guy probably realized
[43:58] this is how I'm going to be forever
[44:01] now there's no hope for
[44:03] me you see I first he was probably
[44:05] claiming to
[44:08] God Lord Heal
[44:10] me take this away from me I don't want
[44:13] to be like this
[44:14] anymore how many have been like
[44:17] that I've been like that I don't want to
[44:19] be the same
[44:21] anymore you know on this man I believe
[44:25] after so much time
[44:28] ended up just being
[44:31] comfortable you see we get in a
[44:33] comfortable
[44:36] situation we get comfortable in our
[44:39] sin we get comfortable in our
[44:43] ways we say oh it's not that
[44:46] bad it's just a
[44:49] movie it's just a funny little
[44:52] joke but that joke keeps
[44:55] going and
[44:58] deeper the movie scenes get
[45:01] deeper you start hearing other
[45:05] things your mind starts opening up a
[45:07] little
[45:09] more to where now you want to
[45:16] experiment but we see that this man got
[45:22] comfortable that when Jesus came to
[45:25] him he just
[45:27] said they keep beating me to the
[45:40] pool now it doesn't say how far this
[45:42] pool was from him that I read
[45:49] anyways but this man had 38 years to get
[45:51] to that
[45:55] pool right you see a lot of the
[45:58] times we make
[46:01] excuses and we say oh it's because I'm
[46:05] not
[46:07] ready oh it's because you know I don't
[46:10] feel like it
[46:13] yet when I get
[46:16] older I'll just come to
[46:19] church I'll I'll just play the
[46:22] Bas I'll just song Lead I'll just
[46:25] preach but I'll give my life to
[46:29] God later because you see I could I
[46:32] could
[46:34] preach I could play the bass I could
[46:37] song Lead but that doesn't mean that I
[46:39] given my life to
[46:42] God you see many of you might be
[46:45] surprised and why why are you up there
[46:49] then many might be surprised and might
[46:52] say why are you up there
[46:54] then well one is because I'm being
[46:56] obedient to my
[46:59] pastor and second because I want to do
[47:03] better you see we should want to do
[47:05] better every
[47:07] day we should have a
[47:10] desire to keep pushing
[47:13] forward it shouldn't take
[47:15] years to get close to
[47:18] God you see but the good thing that I
[47:21] love about this
[47:24] story sorry my mouth's getting
[47:28] ey but the what I love about this
[47:32] story is that Jesus still came to this
[47:38] man you see even when we don't go to
[47:42] Jesus Jesus will still come to
[47:46] you and he will still give you the
[47:50] opportunity you see even when you're
[47:54] depressed when you're discouraged
[47:58] when you don't feel like getting up in
[47:59] the
[48:01] morning when you don't have any
[48:05] motivation Jesus will still come to
[48:09] you and tell you child
[48:11] come I want to help
[48:15] you just give me the
[48:19] chance you see another interesting thing
[48:21] about this
[48:25] story is that Jesus didn't say it was my
[48:28] will that thou be
[48:35] whole but he asked them will thou be
[48:42] whole you see it was the man's
[48:46] decision you see it's our
[48:50] decision Jesus is a gentleman
[48:53] amen he's not going to force you to do
[48:55] anything he's going to give you the
[48:59] choice because he wants to see that you
[49:01] actually love
[49:04] him you see and if this man didn't take
[49:08] action he would have stayed paralyzed
[49:11] still he would have never
[49:14] walked you say if if we don't take
[49:16] action
[49:19] tonight if we keep waiting day after
[49:22] day we're going to stay
[49:25] paralyzed
[49:27] it might not be
[49:28] physically it's going to be
[49:31] spiritually and I believe that's worse
[49:33] than
[49:35] physically because a paralyzed man could
[49:37] be spiritually
[49:41] right spiritually paralyzed is a whole
[49:44] different
[49:46] level I don't want to get to that
[49:51] point amen
[49:55] amenu you see
[49:57] we have to jump the hurdle of a
[50:01] Haven of being
[50:06] comfortable you see um a lot of the
[50:10] times we just be comfortable on the
[50:16] porch see there was five porches the
[50:18] story
[50:20] says and the number five means
[50:24] Grace you see this man was living in
[50:29] Grace all these people that were there
[50:31] were living in
[50:37] Grace but there comes a
[50:40] time we have to get out of living in
[50:42] that Grace for so
[50:49] long that situation that you're
[50:53] in you see your porches will build
[50:58] a determent or discouragement to
[51:04] becoming to not
[51:07] becoming
[51:11] better because we because we'll just
[51:14] make
[51:17] excuses because we'll just say oh well
[51:19] I'm living by Grace God had Grace for
[51:24] me then a year passes
[51:28] five years pass
[51:30] years this man had 38
[51:35] years of just living this
[51:38] way because he was
[51:42] comfortable the next thing I think we
[51:44] have to
[51:48] jump is the hurdle blame I'm sorry the
[51:52] hurdle of
[51:55] blame
[51:57] you see a lot of the times we blame our
[52:00] parents we blame our
[52:04] brothers we blame our
[52:08] pastor we blame everyone that we could
[52:10] think
[52:13] of I even heard something today that we
[52:15] blame people that are already
[52:21] dead what are we why are we blaming
[52:23] people out there they're not going to
[52:24] come
[52:25] back
[52:28] you see we're so
[52:29] focused on our
[52:31] past on what happened when we were
[52:35] young what what our parents did what
[52:38] they didn't let us
[52:42] do that we start blaming everyone for
[52:45] the situation that we're
[52:49] in but in reality we should be blaming
[52:54] ourselves because we can't get out of
[52:56] that
[52:58] situation we're too in love with
[53:01] it we're too in love with the condition
[53:04] that we're
[53:05] in we're in love with the com the
[53:08] comfort that we're
[53:11] in and not in love with
[53:15] Jesus you see and I said we can't be
[53:17] living in Grace for for all that time
[53:20] and I wanted to read the scripture as
[53:24] well Romans 6 1-
[53:28] two and The New International Version I
[53:31] liked it better
[53:34] that it says what shall we say then
[53:36] question
[53:39] mark are we to remain in sin so that
[53:42] Grace may increase another question
[53:49] mark and it says absolutely
[53:54] not how
[53:57] how can
[53:59] we someone moved my notes I think it was
[54:03] the computer up there oh thank you how
[54:06] can we who died to sin still live in
[54:14] it see we can't live in that Grace for
[54:16] too long
[54:19] Brothers we get
[54:24] stuck I want to read a quote before my
[54:27] time
[54:30] ends it says can we see Jesus the or the
[54:34] message can we see
[54:37] Jesus preaching
[54:41] 58 and it
[54:43] says and I just wonder if that isn't the
[54:46] condition of the church
[54:52] tonight you are Christian people you are
[54:56] people who profess to know the Lord
[54:57] [Music]
[55:02] Jesus and he shook every kind of gift
[55:05] before
[55:09] you and this United States of America is
[55:12] supposed to be a Christian
[55:17] Nation and great man has crossed this
[55:19] nation Billy granham and or Roberts and
[55:22] AA
[55:25] Allen or or
[55:28] Roberts and many great ministers with
[55:30] great gifts and they shook it before
[55:32] their
[55:36] eyes and they sit like they are
[55:38] paralyzed spiritually
[55:45] paralyzed I wonder what God thinks about
[55:48] his
[55:50] children when he can show show them his
[55:53] divine
[55:55] presence
[55:59] and listen brothers and they'll still
[56:03] say well I'll wait till brother Allen
[56:06] comes by or brother Roberts or brother
[56:13] brandham
[56:14] robt and he says don't wait for them to
[56:17] come
[56:20] by see they're
[56:23] men Jesus is here now
[56:28] showing himself before you as a living
[56:31] God see Jesus is here tonight
[56:35] Brothers see we don't have to wait on
[56:37] our
[56:38] pastor we don't have to wait on brother
[56:41] Alex or all the ordained ministers or
[56:43] ministers
[56:45] here oh you could have it
[56:48] today you just have to come to Jesus
[56:50] with all your
[56:53] heart and believe with all your heart
[56:57] and you see it keeps saying and the
[56:58] church has become just staring
[57:03] out why we believe oh yes we
[57:08] believe but it's become so common to the
[57:13] people see Brothers we're not common
[57:17] people see I don't know if you're common
[57:19] but I don't think we're common
[57:22] people you see brother brandham says
[57:24] we're odd balls amen
[57:27] and he keeps
[57:29] saying but the Bible is saying he is the
[57:32] same yesterday today and
[57:38] forever then he has to be the
[57:41] same amen My Brother David could come up
[57:44] you see we are not common people
[57:47] Brothers you see Jesus is here
[57:50] tonight you just have to believe it with
[57:52] all your
[57:53] heart God bless brother
[57:56] [Applause]
[58:03] God bless you
[58:05] Brothers I would like to read James 410
[58:09] real
[58:12] quick it
[58:15] says humble yourselves in the sight of
[58:17] the
[58:20] Lord and He Shall lift you
[58:24] up today brother
[58:27] I would like to speak
[58:29] on on
[58:31] spiritual on spiritual
[58:39] paralysis now many
[58:41] times we fall into
[58:45] sin but many times when we fall into
[58:49] sin instead of getting up I'm sorry
[58:52] instead of getting
[58:54] up we stay down
[58:57] we get deeper and deeper into that hole
[58:59] of
[59:01] sin to the
[59:03] point where we become cold where we
[59:05] become cold and
[59:08] distant from
[59:11] God and
[59:14] brothers that shouldn't
[59:17] happen especially for children of
[59:21] God but
[59:23] unfortunately it happens more often and
[59:28] not and we become so cold and distant
[59:31] from
[59:33] God we become spiritually
[59:38] paralyzed and we become so deep in our
[59:44] sin we become
[59:47] comfortable and we like to stay down
[59:50] there we don't want to get up no
[59:53] more it gets so bad
[59:56] we become attracted
[59:59] to or worse than
[1:00:01] that we change our own
[1:00:06] environment to reflect our
[1:00:10] condition and that just makes it harder
[1:00:12] for
[1:00:14] us to come out of that
[1:00:17] sin to come out of that
[1:00:20] addiction that we
[1:00:23] formed that changed us
[1:00:27] and does not allow us to come
[1:00:30] out and many
