[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign help me turn the heater off i feel like i'm going to suffocate here and then brother isaac's going to have to step in ruth chapter one elema is the subject is restoration restoring our position in the book of ruth historia we're going to be studying the story [Music] but the two main characters in this story is ruth and boaz so repeat ruth and boaz ruth is a type of us root representative ruth represents the bride of the lord jesus christ and bro boaz represents the lord jesus christ but in the first chapter boaz doesn't come now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons this man is the husband of naomi and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his two sons of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and the limitless naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the woman of moab the name of the one was orphan the name of the other ruth and they dwelled there about 10 years and naomi said turn against my daughters will he go with me are are there yet any more sons in my womb that there may be your husbands but it says here turn again my daughters go your way for i'm too old to have any husband i'll have nothing to give you yes and they lifted up their voice and wiped again and orpha kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave unto her inaudible and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law respond to and ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to turn from following after thee for whether thou goest i will go and where thou lodges i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god let us pray senor jesus christ lord jesus christ a safe place because we desire help us take another step higher clearly i don't have enough time to finish today [Music] above all it tells us that god is more than a cancer he has more than blood nosotros for us jesus christ himself as much as we bury i am his i don't know why we're very similar to elimelech's family naomi's husband feliz they were happy do you know how i know they were happy san feliz viviendo bethlehem meaning the house of bread of god in judea bethlehem was a city in judah significa and judah means significant worship established they were in the house of bread of god con adoracion with the worst of worship in their lips not only that but their names tell us how happy they were in this place means god is significant naomi means pleasing her first son malone significant how they felt many alive of happiness how easy is it many times to step out of the place that god has different and seek something different that's what happened with them in israel they were in israel [Music] and bethlehem judah there was a famine in this place that if they depart from god right away we're trying to find something to entertain us instead of waiting on him finding something different yes sorrowful times cristiano every christmas specifically every place has he not been faithful [Applause] always has we [Applause] in times of affliction and difficulty we ought to say to the devil just wait just hold on hold on of the descendants of law abraham's nephew just and during those times because another one takes his place [Music] we're is sometimes we have more trust in someone else than god another but we flee died and then the satisfaction died one at a time they died in satisfaction they were found unsatisfied that's all the world does that's all the devil does and takes everything [Music] and there was naomi with her two daughters in-law until she understood she had to return and then she understood she didn't belong there and india she understood if she received something if she were to survive she had to return to her home a very respected historian of the hebrews believed that ruth was eglon's son in the book of judges the bible one of the tribes of benjamin that killed them are left-handed but he was a king of moab it was very likely that she was the daughter of this mobile king all right now imagine my hidden is had nothing to do with israel natural [Applause] [Music] your family in the flesh i believe we should watch or take care of our families oh jesus christ who is my friend is hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] lord jesus christ [Music] is [Music] will [Music] apparently [Applause] [Music] neither is male nor female for ye are all of one christ jesus what a tremendous revelation that it does not depend on your language important [Applause] and the book of ruth is a very beautiful picture of christ ruth went over in a strange country speaking about naomi when she return to your country brothers [Applause] found out that you're more than your people it's more than your place it's more than your flesh yes [Music] now watch regresan in chapter 2. they come to israel and naomi there's a field of one of her kinsmen marientes kinsmen of her family avion campo there was a field [Music] and there was a lot to eat of and the reason why she was saying that was because she knew boaz was the owner and she knew if he maybe saw her if he may be sold and she was after them that were reaping [Music] to the because is who that's but it goes here was an angel [Applause] [Music] why do we have a problem with someone being a chief or being in charge why does it bothers us that there's someone in charge people hear about brother branham and it bothers them that we speak about brother brannon because many churches don't speak about brother branham but god says it's in the bible holy ghost is in [Music] so god is asking accounts to the and he says she's been laboring forgive me i'm not gonna get to what i wanted to but there's no problem that was said over the reapers whose damn soul is this campos and the servant that was said over the reapers answered and said it it is a moabitess damsel that come back with naomi out of the country of moab hasta and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and had continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house let me tell you this pleases guys this is what please please she didn't surrender that she was i tried to receive something [Music] thou not my daughter go not to glean and feel in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens now i'm gonna skip a couple things to get some of my points chapter three her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz of our kindred with who's made himself lost therefore and anoint thee and put thy raymond upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lies down thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay down and he shall tell thee what thou shall do now notice the story ruth tells naomi what happened there's much more to mention on chapter 2. but i won't mention it today and then naomi says he is our kinsmen eliza you protected it because remembering judges many came to steal the harvest so and or was it that jesus in la cruz hello [Applause] consummato with his garment with his raymond so when he goes and rests she covers herself she covers herself with the same holy spirit covering him says brother branham and she understood what she was asking for he wanted to he wanted him to redeem her there's someone with the right to redeem you necesito [Music] of this flesh [Music] i want to tell you this our boaz [Music] he is more than blood [Music] is more than the fleshly desires we have [Music] as much as our fleshed houses [Music] now we want the things of this world us [Music] there's [Music] [Music] they were connected [Music] [Applause] that's why the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] of the other things [Music] [Music] you feel i need you to god [Music] for me [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] care [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] have you came to him [Music] [Music] come to his feet [Music] [Music] recognizing that he rested on the cross [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] free [Music] [Applause]
