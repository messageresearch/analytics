fills my heart GRE you in the precious name our beloved Lord we give the greeting to anyone that is new here we also greet our brothers in Uruapan we love you so much we love you and we're always praying for you it's a pleasure to see you here brother and we thank God for this precious day and our brother Titus for the trust now if you allow me follow me to Proverbs 17 verse 27 and 28 Proverbs 17 verse 27 and 28 the word of the Lord reads he that hath knowledge spareth his words and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and when he that shth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding Isaiah 53 verse you know the scripture very well Isaiah 53 verse 7 he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth let us pray beloved God how can we not be thankful with you in our lips from the depth of our heart there should Simply Be words of Thanksgiving for everything that you do through the trials for good moments for everything Lord we should be a people that are thankful with you now we ask you that you be with my brother VI my brother Isaac and that you may be with me also Lord and may we speak what you have for your people bless your children your daughters and sons be with them and we welcome you Lord thank you for everything in your blessed name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen may be seated this is the foundation service and our subject continues conquering ourselves and with brother VI we have this subtitle and we have titled our message the power of Silence now I'm going to start with this with this reflection there was a farmer that had a clock or was that he appreciated so much and in his farm this farmer lost this watch he spends time trying to find this precious object for him in the hay and every corner of the barn but he is not successful and then he sees a group of kids playing outside his barn and tells them children if you can help me find this watch I will reward you the children obviously when they heard that they'd be rewarded they go and get in this barn and they look begin to look for it in the hay in every corner and they make a mess and the hours go by and these children do not succeed they began to be fussy and leave they leave the barn until the children that were left without success they leave also and they couldn't find this watch the farmer was going to give up and when he was closing the doors from the barn one of the children stand in front of him and tell him give me a new opportunity to look for the watch and the farmer said well nothing's going to happen if I give him another chance and he says go and he closed the doors after 10 15 minutes this boy comes out with the watch and the farmer tells him with joy to see this precious object that was how did you find it and the boy said I didn't do anything all I did was sit down I stayed still in silence and I began to hear tick the ticking of the watch and that sound I began to follow it and that's where I found the watch the power of Silence has power if we learn to be quiet to stay still without a doubt that in the silence we will find what many times we lose look the secrets of Silence a mind and a peaceful Spirit can think better than a mind and a and a spirit that is uneasy here and now let's allow a few moments of Silence in our lives in our spirit in our mind sometimes all that we need is to relax be still stay in silence and hear let's stop from always that our mind our spirit our soul let's allow it to have a few minutes of silence because a mind a spirit a soul that is at peace that can meditate is better than a mind and a spirit that is stressed in silence it's often in the place the place where God is waiting for us so we can accomplish to hear him Psalms 46 10 says you know it be still and know that I am God now look because God not only is God in the Thunder not only is God in the praise not only is God in the shout not only in the noise not only is he in the valley not only is he in the mountain is in silence also because he is a god of Silence also the power of Silence gives trust but trust in God only and truly can be seen in God's hands and above trials that we can have in this life as human beings have been able to be silent even in these complicated situations Luther Martin Luther King said this at the end we remember not the words of our enemies but the Silence of our friends and that's the truth a man look when God is silent it's because something great is about to happen is Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive between the New and Old Testament 400 years pass where God stayed silent why because something great was but our problem is that we cannot wait we get desperate and in that time in the time between the New and Old Testament the people got desperate brother Alex they made their own religion they confused themselves that's the problem but always may God anytime that God stays still silence is because something great is about to happen and we have a great example there was a man that was oppressed that humbled himself and did not open his mouth and like a lamb straight to the slaughter house and like a sheep also did not open her mouth before its shearers this person did not open their mouth our brother from no Mexico was preaching on Wednesday Enrique brother Enrique [Music] a lot of what he spoke about it really got to me look when the Lord Jesus Christ they taking him prisoner before pilot pilot says speak what do you have to say against yourself because they accuse you our brother Bram said he closed his mouth and didn't say anything he stayed in silence when he when they're taking him after having him been and they begin to strike him they bind his hands those hands that healed kill the sick were now in binds and they punish him now but he never complained he never opened his mouth after other men they make a crown of for and put it on his head and they make wounds in his head and he stays still he doesn't say anything he does not open his mouth and other soldiers and they bind his eyes and they beat his head and they tell him you that are a Seer you that are a prophet tell us who hit you but he did not open his mouth and stayed in silent when he's carrying that cross brother Bram says cross was not like this wood here no it was not smooth it was a rough W it was rough a wood that that hurts and wounds but he didn't say anything he did not open his mouth and that's how it was that's how he went to Calvary it's at the cross when he is being crucified where he gives seven Expressions we don't know the order of them but they're like this the first one was father forgive them for they know not what they already crucified and then he answers to the thief truly I say today you will be with me in paradise and then he tells John the Beloved disciple son behold your mother mother behold your son then he says my God my God why have Thou forsaken me and then he says I'm thirsty and they gave him vinegar he did not open his mouth for anything else then he says it is finished and at the end he says father I command my spirit in your hands those were the words he spoke you know brother he conquered in silence many times we want to conquer in the disorder in the noise for the people to see us we have not conquered in the silence the Lord Jesus Christ never opened his mou to curse or complain he took his cross he knew it had to be he conquered in silence and when he went to the he had conquered already his flesh he had conquered this he had already conquered two kingdoms spiritual real and the the natural realm but first of all he had to conquer himself in silence Matthew 66 reads but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which see in secret shall reward thee open and sometimes we're backwards we want to be rewarded in public we want to conquer in public but we're not able to get into our secret place close that door bend the knee and Conquer in silence and let him let him speak I'll be closing with this in the message hear his voice preach 1958 brother random says here he's speaking about Moses but this called my attention and we won't stay quiet 10 minutes so God can speak to us with all the rumble and Bumble we have on this day and yet Moses after 40 years stood there and in that presence of that bush and that one voice that called him Watch what it says he knew more about God in five minutes after that then all the 80 years of training had taught him look if only we could stay silent still and silence we would learn more from our beloved God than what we've learned through our lives that made him a different man it'll make a different man and woman out if you'll just stand still long enough to hear his voice like Samuel stand still don't be excited if you want something of God ask him then stand still and listen see what he's going to say about it just open your heart say what about it Lord Jesus just stay there if he doesn't answer the first five hours then wait another if he doesn't answer today he'll answer tomorrow this week next week Hew hear his voice speak back in your heart and say yes I'm the Lord that Health thee then it is all over then it's settled then see I'm the the Lord who forgives thy sins now go and sin no more I don't condemn you then you can go free you're all right if we can only keep in silence and we give him the opportunity I believe that we cannot conquer ourselves ourselves if first of all we don't give God the opportunity to hear him to hear him in silence because not only can you conquer in public the majority and the greatest conquering is in silence God bless you Breen God bless you God bless the you know Sister Vicki in California everybody that watches you know around the world you I've come to realize that I've been in more living rooms than than I than I ever thought you know the brothers are like we know you brother and you know I've been in the living room know they they watch the church and and you know it's it's just amazing how God can do things uh you know uh it was pretty it was pretty cold this morning you know in the sanctuary and I just I was telling brother Tito in the back you know how uh you know how how far at least uh my family and I have come in the Lord not only us but I believe that you guys as well amen we used to you know we used to congregate in a basement it was actually two basements and then we got we got to this uh we got we got to have a little school it's an old school and it was cold I remember uh we used to be able to see our breath and and you know it was it was amazing because it it never stopped us from serving the lord I we'd have our blankets my wife you know she gets cold really easy and we couldn't even go to the bathroom because the water was frozen and uh you know bathroom is off limits but there we were serving the lord and I I I never want to get to a place uh you know where I'm too big to go somewhere amen amen you know we don't matter how big our church is you know I don't believe that we serve a God you know that won't go to the the most humblest of places to the most humblest of places you know he he he'll he'll just he he'll go wherever you know there's a soul that's crying out you know and that's a that's a big a big uh you know that's that's one of the silent things you know that God does you know and and that's the God that I serve amen let us go to Joshua chapter 6 you know they're just beautiful memories you know I never want to forget Joshua 6 ver8 and it reads like this and it came to and it came to pass when Joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the Lord and blew with the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the reward came after the ark the the the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets and Joshua had commanded the people saying you shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you to shout then shall you shout uh you know when we uh talk about silence you know we're talking about conquering ourselves you know in the foundation and uh you know when when we think about those things you know and and and the warfare that's going on you know a lot of people think that Warfare is all about screaming and shouting and uh you know you you think about when you think about it you know there is a lot of screaming there is a lot of shouting you know there's a lot of wounded people and there's people that act like they're wounded you know but you know the point is it's just there's just a lot of noise you know but uh I believe I serve a God you know he doesn't he doesn't need to make a lot of noise you know to to to win amen amen you know my my God can just he he he can stay silent you know because he's he's not worried about who he is amen amen he he knows who he is he's not gonna talk just to talk you know and I believe his children should be the same way you know I believe that we talk a whole lot a lot of times you know and we talk so much because you know we like to hear ourselves you know but in all reality you know when you talk a whole lot you know it just shows how insecure you may be amen amen how many believe that you know some people like to hear themselves you know and they put off a fight for everything it doesn't matter how simple it is you know they put up a fight amen amen but you know I want to read what brother brandham says you know uh he he says this he says look at Elijah he says look at Elicia that followed him he says look at John the Baptist in his day he says look at Paul when all had forsaken him he still stood because he had met God he he heard a voice speaking to him one day he says look at John Wesley Martin Luther luvin men who's ever done anything for God been men who heard God and stood and and stood on their convictions listened and waited it don't make any difference what the rest says they wait till they hear God amen amen it says and then he says in the next quote or the next says you know great things don't make much noise did you ever think of that you know the sun can draw 10 million barrels of water with less noise then we can pump a glass full of a glass full out of a pump it says great things usually move silently did you ever hear the planets turning around around one another says no but how great is it did you ever hear the day break and yet it scatters all the darkness and it's so silent it don't even wake us up but it scatters all the night could you you imagine that how great of a God we have you know what he brother brandham says that when he spoke the world into existence that there wasn't there wasn't a whole lot of noise you know and and you know you may say you know maybe because he understood it all you know and he did you know but I believe you know that as Sons and Daughters of God you may not have to you may not understand it all you know but you don't have to understand it all in order to believe it all you know I believe you know that if you believe you know that that God that God has ordained this place for us you don't have to wonder how he did it you just got to believe and know that he did it amen you know there's a lot of people when they don't understand something you know don't want to do it so they start putting up a fuz you know and and they start fighting about this and that when all reality if you knew the god that you claim to know then you would just do what he said to do that's exactly right we have come to a place know I hope this church never gets to a place you have to understand everything in order to do something amen amen you know I believe uh that when these people when the people of Israel you know they had had a great Victory you know they had crossed the Red Sea you see they had come into the promised land you see and I believe that they were they were rejoicing but you know then they hit a wall they went they they looked at Jericho how they saw the great biggest walls they ever seen and I believe that a lot of them got real quiet you know after that they had seen these walls because even Joshua oh went to go take a walk amen amen because a lot of times even the leader doesn't have all the answers I believe that that's why you got to get quiet a lot of times I believe our pastor many times he don't make decisions just because he thinks he's got to go to his to his to his place he's got to go into that secret chamber where he has to take counsel he has to be one onone and he has to face the almighty trust me I believe that the people know when a man of God has been with the almighty you ain't going to fool the people you know sometimes you can fool your mom you can fool your dad you can fool the brother but you are never going to God that you are not going to be able to lie to him knows exactly what you're [Music] doing he knows those things he knows you know faith faith is silent brother brand says faith is silent Faith doesn't have to make a whole lot of noise because Faith knows where it stands amen amen I believe that when Joshua took his walk to to seek counsel from the Lord he was by himself he was like Lord what are we going to do we've run into a wall we don't know what's on the other side believe a lot of times we don't even know what the enemy on the other side looks like because of the walls amen amen and you know the way that the Lord works it's just beyond my understanding you know I just got got to believe it you know and the council that Joshua receives from the Lord is to start start walking you know just start marching you know just start marching around this city it almost looked like Child's Play you know that when these people might have poked their head out you know they what are they doing what what are they doing out there they may say the same thing about you but what do he do going to church go to church every Sunday what what's happening there it's ridiculous in the eyes of the unbeliever it may seem ridiculous to you at the moment but God said to do it and they R away and they went around the first day sir and the trumpet was sounding the whole time and the trumpet hasn't stopped sounding amen the gospel still being preached and you know you come to church you may hear the same thing the next Sunday and then the next Sunday you may still feel sick the next Sunday but you still keep going you see because it it seems ridiculous that that the people would conquer this way amen amen it seem foolish just like the way the the Bible says you know how the the gospel the preaching of the Gospel seems fo like foolishness but we know but we know that we've seen we've seen the hand of the almighty amongst us only goes before us behind us we have we have we have backing that we have and I believe that this isn't this isn't it having a big church that's not it if you think that's it got something else coming I'm not just expecting a big church God to do greater things this is just the beginning you see this was the first the First wall but this was the first wall that Israel had to face amen amen I'm closing now and they go around once twice three four five six Maybe you haven't seen a change in your life you still got to keep believing amen amen see we're not working on our time and we and we saw that with the church we work on God's time you see because when I when I was young I was waiting for the time that I could grow up you know I was just quiet I wouldn't say a whole lot but I was just waiting for the moment and you know God's just waiting for that moment where you can just be still you can just be silence and you can begin to grow because that's what God wants he wants you to grow he wants you to grow in the things of the Lord because he was not going to give us this church acting like a bunch of little kids like he wants maturity he want the only way you'll ever get up someplace with God is when you get silent amen Amen brother brandham says this he says this in the message of the reaction to an action he says but when real faith has caught the vision but when real faith has caught the vision it can keep silence and rest calmly because it knows it's going to happen don't forget that faith will rest with perfect Assurance no matter what the storms are saying Faith rest with Assurance faith can take it stand upon a rock look into a grave or a lovely little chunk of your own lovely loving heart has been buried the SE I am the resurrection of the life rest Assurance we speak of faith we talk of faith and I wonder sometimes if we know what we're talking about I wonder if it isn't hope instead of faith faith doesn't move no matter how contrary it looks our faith stays right there our faith stays right there and you know there everybody was silent they were going around the walls of Jericho you know and on the in the last at the at the the on the seventh one they went around seven times you know and when and when the leader gave the shout when he said you know do he speak or shout then and that's when the walls came down you see because God don't speak in vain Jesus doesn't speak in vain Jesus doesn't speak in vain you see when he went to the cross it was just something you know something beyond our comprehension you know until a prophet came you know and revealed to us oh you know the the mighty thing that silence can do amen amen amen oh because when he dies you see when you die because it's not just about him dying but that was just the beginning of something else because it wasn't just about him dying but you have to die when he was on the cross and he didn't say word oh he could have said a word but you know at that point you know if he would have called for the Angels they would have came but then he wouldn't have received the glory he would not have received the glory if the Angels had come he had to stay silent amen [Music] amen but he gave up The Ghost and what we fail to realize many times is that when it's our turn to die when it's our time to let go of what we have of who we are we don't realize that it's an opport it's an opportunity that opens up so many more channels more channels for somebody else more channels to do things for [Music] others it opens up so many things you see the conquer of Jero it was the tearing down of the walls and you know that's what we put up many times we put up walls maybe amongst the Brethren or maybe amongst amongst you know other churches but God came to tear those down because he wants to conquer and you know you put up walls against God many times but you know he wants to conquer he wants to conquer the hearts because that's what we've done done we put up these walls but at the hearing of the word one more time at the hearing of the word oh we know that God breaks down those walls you know with just his love to know how great of a love that he [Music] has you know in finishing you know the there there Comes A Time in your life where you're going to have to realize that you know your way isn't the way if you ever want to get conquer you're going to have to allow God to work to find that place where you can just hear hear him where it's not it's nobody else except for him one more where it's nobody else except for him that's still Small Voice you know just like the watch that the brother was talking about uh because when Jesus resurrected he died the same way it was silence it was silence but when it came time to speak he made it count he made it count he can make it count for you if you hear his voice it'll count of the time is drawing close you know and you know and the end is approaching uh you know that's that's all I have this morning God bless [Music] yous [Music] no

anymore that sure with our lives what we want to [Music] do how many times the Lord is like that with us he doesn't want us to speak no more promising that this coming year we'll do this we'll do that it's no longer time to speak it's time to stay quiet come to him and say Lord I am quiet Lord I Surrender my life I Surrender my soul I surrender all my being may you do the work Lord I don't need to
