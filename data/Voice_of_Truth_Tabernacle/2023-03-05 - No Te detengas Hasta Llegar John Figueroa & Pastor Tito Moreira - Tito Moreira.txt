I hope you see everyone wonderful word from our brother John God bless him God is good right God's presence is here [Music] and I believe that's what we come for that's our purpose so take advantage of God's presence yeah I told them before get the out of that country and from that I'm from thy Father's House unto a land that I will shoot notice God didn't show him the land yet he was waiting to show him but sometimes God doesn't show us till we obey him Grande California never told me to move no one told us that we had to move our Church's life is waiting on a sign from God and when God gave it there was no room for doubt in my house there was no daughter my heart God wanted to reload the only decision I had to make will I obey God's will oh yes well I do my own and I said stand in front of you they're in eternity he was not happy where he was there was something in his heart no in English there's a word you can't translate exactly is homesick foreign foreign foreign [Applause] get me out of my oh God calls Abraham so find a true home I love Psalm 84. someone that is homesick to be in the Lord's House Tabernacles or Lord of hosts my so long it even fainted for the courts of the Lord because my heart and my flesh cryeth out up for the Living God hi the sparrow has found in house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her Young and Earth sovereign we will rule foreign for us [Music] Glory are yours yes God had to make Abraham go through training broke his heart so many times broke his heart so many times I imagine when Abraham got to Iran with his father familiares of family members God had already told Abraham leave your Homeland these are parents leave your family I want you only for me I want you only for me what it wants us only for him once only for him yes his family his brother and I imagine God had to do something about that okay I imagine that he said I need to take your father from you I need to take your brother from here sometimes we need help from God foreign just like he did with the prophet [Music] [Music] the Lord all my life you've broken my heart over and over all right yeah yeah how many times has God broken our hearts and it seems like he says forgive me Lord forgive me son I can't do it I won't do that okay we'll do in your life because I'm preparing you where the Branham says you've broken my heart over and over but I love you for it hello he lived as a foreign that you want exactly senor that's the type of God we serve it's a God that wants to please a guard that wants to please us but now with Earthly things spiritual things man Eternal with permanent things yeah Jeremiah 29 11 says right now the thoughts I have I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end let me tell you if on this Earth we are a failure as long as we're not a failure over there he has the expected and I desire he has the expected ends I desire there's something in my life that is yearning for more there's something in my life home exactly but it's required of people that are willing so not stop stop here to not stop halfway to not stop with an experience superficial with a superficial experience or shallow experience with just hearing what God can do but somebody is a personal experience the life of the Lord Jesus Christ but once everything everything just like Abraham that is [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] Abraham was had tears because the trial ain't a trials [Applause] yeah you let go in his hands of putting that knife in yeah it was his promised son that's what he waited for 25 years because God called Abraham when he was old don't tell me God can't call you don't give God excuses we give God so many excuses when he was stricken in years God proving that from nothing he can make sense foreign amen I sincerely believe that God is barely working with us yes that's right 70 years 25 years waiting for this promise son he preserved Abraham preserved himself he preserved himself God comes for a church that's preserved the Bible says when he come to us where he find Faith let me tell you there must be somebody even though they don't see anything yet they're still waiting for it I'm still waiting you'll see God's Miracles what that doesn't mean that's Abraham's Gene come on Hallelujah [Applause] foreign I haven't seen it Hallelujah [Applause] God tells Abraham when he left his father then he left lot possess your enemies [Music] eternity together Hallelujah palabras in other words the devil will close doors the devil will close the door the devil will try to stop you the devil will try to stop you hello will put all types of stumbling stones meanwhile um I'm sure the same was for Abraham all of a sudden he had it Downs he had him moments where he didn't know what he was doing all of a sudden he saw around and only maybe saw hypocrites then he is closer to God than you thank you all right that's the truth because God can use a hypocrite also he can take him in his hands discouragement we let a trial hindrance we let criticism hinder us don't realize economy hinder us pero but when God tells Abraham thy seed he spoke about us he was speaking about us we are Abraham's seed take me look at me take away what's mine neces I need to return home I won't stay here and that is found Fallen that's a door of Satan that wants to stop you there but you must say I can't stay this way if you allowed a door of Satan hinder or stop you it's because you don't believe God whatever [Music] you must say say hey get away from me I'm going home anyone or anything stop I will make it say I will make it I will make it I return home I will make it please stand [Music] not sure what you're you've been struggling with that is [Music] maybe you're struggling with a broken heart [Music] but you know a broken heart is required so worship God with all your hearts to give him all your heart [Music] thank you [Music] I don't know what you struggle with okay okay [Music] I believe God does have you there with a purpose but it's not for you to stay there if God has broken your heart it's because he wants you to go help him because only somebody with a broken leg can help someone else with a broken heart only someone that has had to trust him you can help someone to trust in God [Music] only someone that's been forgiven well [Music] can help someone forgives and others come to forgiveness only someone that's been there can help others when they're falling [Music] God has a purpose for your life healing for another heart you know God is do you realize God's preparing you because he wants to use flexible the holy ghosts [Music] um foreign [Music] Hallelujah Church [Music] let God do what he pleases you know where you're disobeying too
