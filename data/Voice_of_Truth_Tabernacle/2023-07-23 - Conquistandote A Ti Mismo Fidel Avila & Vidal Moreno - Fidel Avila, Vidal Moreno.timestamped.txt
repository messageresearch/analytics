[21:27] may God bless you
[21:41] places in US
[21:44] let's read it says like this
[21:48] take heed unto thyself
[21:52] continue in them
[21:54] for in doing this is
[22:03] bless your word
[22:07] thank you Lord for your word
[22:12] okay because you're good
[22:18] myself
[22:23] we'll be able to express ourselves
[22:25] easily with our words
[22:30] along with our interpreters
[22:33] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:44] with the topic conquering yourself
[22:48] forgive me Lord of God
[22:53] I was a little nervous
[22:56] it's not the first time I preach
[22:58] pero
[23:01] no says
[23:02] I know this fish is a little weird
[23:07] conquering yourself
[23:09] and our subtitles is Let It Go
[23:15] and I'm going to be focusing on uh and
[23:18] Ben said in conquering yourself
[23:21] Let It Go
[23:26] you know something
[23:28] uh
[23:31] as the years have gone by uh by the
[23:34] grace of God
[23:38] I was barely seeing the picture or the
[23:41] date that I was I was baptized
[23:43] I was baptized
[23:49] this time that's passed
[23:52] my eyes
[23:57] of Christianity
[24:00] they want to conquer their neighbor
[24:11] of the world
[24:14] we want to be conquered
[24:22] I want to be conquers of the whole world
[24:25] [Applause]
[24:30] because we're humans
[24:35] we're now Angels we're humans
[24:38] Sons and Daughters of God in flesh amen
[24:42] amen sometimes
[25:19] they can't conquer themselves
[25:22] it doesn't matter who it is
[25:41] that's what we don't understand
[25:56] we're going to struggle
[25:59] is
[26:03] the scripture says that a Paul told
[26:05] Timothy to take care of yourself
[26:09] I've been uh recently meditating on
[26:11] myself
[26:12] because this morning
[26:14] there's no one more important than
[26:16] yourself
[26:19] that's right
[26:23] because we want to save everyone
[26:27] but if you're not even saved yourself
[26:33] to whoever
[26:36] why don't we apply it to ourselves
[26:39] what is it what what does it cost
[26:43] it's costing us something
[26:46] Uno
[28:00] Holy Spirit and you don't have anything
[28:07] forgive me but it's the truth
[28:10] is
[28:14] condition
[29:15] when you have nothing man ual
[29:19] spirit that you have
[29:21] Diablo it's of the same Kingdom
[29:25] against the devil he doesn't fight
[29:27] himself right Brothers it has to be a
[29:31] change
[29:41] because there are times that we want to
[29:43] we want to hunt each other I'm gonna
[29:45] bring it down a little bit we want to
[29:47] hunt each other get married
[29:50] get married to each other
[29:54] oh my wife is going to make me happy
[29:58] it doesn't happen here right
[30:01] my wife is going to make me happy
[30:04] [Music]
[30:07] Pastor has told us many times
[30:12] no one will make you happy
[30:17] it's part
[30:19] we love our wife love your husband
[30:24] love your children
[30:27] foreign
[30:54] oh
[31:02] Elias Elijah in the case
[31:07] [Music]
[31:21] bring it to manifestation
[31:30] the same
[31:34] um
[31:44] and the Very God of Peace sanctify you
[31:47] holy and I pray God your Holy Spirit
[31:49] listen to the coming of the Lord I want
[31:53] to I want you to see this that we're
[31:54] founded on three three parts we're based
[31:56] of three parts
[32:05] he first foreign
[32:40] hablando
[32:43] so we're trying to get to know each
[32:45] other
[32:53] look for a partner that's filled with
[32:55] the Holy Spirit
[32:59] but
[33:59] will be able to help his children
[34:03] so these three has to be in unity
[34:26] there is a why
[34:30] I don't know if you place it but
[34:37] body Spirits
[34:42] I've spoken of this many times
[35:02] [Music]
[35:05] it just depends on the spirit
[36:00] that is in your spirit
[36:34] humility and foreign
[37:29] and David
[37:31] is saw
[37:36] he's seen David
[37:38] that he killed Goliath he took off his
[37:42] head
[37:45] they came from the victory
[37:48] David
[37:55] sauce
[37:59] and capture this church
[38:01] he began to sing or they began to sing
[38:07] I saw heard that
[38:09] says
[38:15] he was the anointed one of the Lord and
[38:19] he heard that and he said what
[38:32] there came a spirit
[38:36] there are many of us it's also entering
[38:38] to us
[38:43] it's Envy
[38:45] is
[38:46] the spirit of Envy came to him
[38:57] his harp right
[39:04] and
[39:15] then he threw it again
[39:19] conquering yourself
[39:22] he threw it to him
[39:24] what was going on with Saul
[39:27] something else had conquered him
[39:32] I don't want to be that person
[39:38] but God delivers us from being that
[39:41] person
[39:43] he threw it to him twice
[39:46] you know what David did
[39:51] he continued playing
[39:58] because he said
[40:00] the battle's not mine
[40:05] the battle is his
[40:08] amen
[40:15] right
[40:18] because that's a tremendous thing it's
[40:21] conquering yourself
[40:36] for himself
[40:48] conquered himself
[40:51] that's why when he threw the spirit
[40:54] and he respected
[40:57] the anointed one of the Lord
[41:03] and sometimes we're envious
[41:06] this is my brother my sister
[41:09] who am I to decide
[41:26] I want his glory
[41:35] for me that's right
[41:37] I want his group
[41:40] of that envious spirit
[42:16] and with this thought I'm going to be
[42:18] closing
[42:20] David David
[42:25] a man after God's Own Heart
[42:30] on occasion he was anxious thought
[42:38] s
[42:50] I'm the holy person
[42:54] don't get comfortable
[42:57] David was lazy
[43:24] the wife of his brother
[43:32] it doesn't matter who you are
[43:36] yes there David was
[43:39] and he asked who's that lady
[43:50] and so then he brought it
[43:55] come over here
[43:57] wow
[44:02] this morning
[44:05] you need to conquer yourself don't think
[44:08] no pences
[44:22] that's when things happen
[44:25] there David was
[44:27] they sent they sent for him
[44:30] and David
[44:34] apart from being a womanizer
[44:39] And Then There came another Spirit
[44:44] trying to kill him
[44:48] was here making an effect in that impact
[44:50] on David
[44:53] um
[44:55] you know the story
[44:58] and after that
[45:00] send them in the front lines
[45:05] and he said kill him that's pretty much
[45:08] what he did
[45:16] that he was going to die
[45:19] but God help us this morning brothers
[45:23] and Deliver Us from that Spirit
[45:26] of Envy
[45:31] is going to be speaking to us
[45:37] God bless you Brethren um
[45:41] we send greetings to our brothers
[45:44] our brothers from California the ones
[45:48] that they watch us God bless you okay
[45:52] let us open our Bibles
[45:55] Book of Matthew
[45:57] chapter 21 verse
[46:02] 12 and 13.
[46:04] and it says like this
[46:07] Matthew 21 verse 12.
[46:11] it says and Jesus went into the temple
[46:13] of God
[46:14] and cast out all them that sold and
[46:16] bought in the temple and over through
[46:18] the tables of the money changers and the
[46:20] seats of them that sold doves
[46:23] Palomas
[46:36] and said unto them it is written my
[46:39] house shall be called The House of
[46:41] Prayer but you have made it at the end
[46:43] of Thieves
[46:51] I want you to notice how he didn't say
[46:55] at that
[46:56] momento he didn't say it was his
[46:59] father's house
[47:04] he said it was his house
[47:07] amen amen he was letting him know
[47:11] who he was amen amen we'll go to Hebrews
[47:17] chapter 12
[47:19] verse Uno
[47:24] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1.
[47:28] it says like this
[47:30] it says wherefore seeing we also are
[47:33] compassed about what's so great a cloud
[47:35] of witnesses
[47:41] let us lay aside every weight and the
[47:44] sin which doth so easily beset us
[47:49] and let us run with patience to raise
[47:52] the set before us uh
[47:59] we're talking about uh for our title is
[48:04] a Lego is you know I think that's one of
[48:08] the hardest things to do
[48:11] no for many of us
[48:13] is to let go you know but I think in
[48:17] order to move on with God
[48:20] that's one thing that we have to do
[48:22] you can't move forward
[48:25] if you can't let go
[48:27] amen amen you know uh brother uh brother
[48:31] Fidel Romano Fidel he was talking about
[48:33] you know the the senses
[48:36] both the physical ones
[48:40] and as well as the spiritual ones
[48:42] you know and those are the senses that
[48:45] we're fighting yes
[48:50] that's you know quite a bit of Senses
[48:53] but you know God just needs is
[48:58] he needs just one sense
[49:00] and he can defeat the rest of the
[49:02] sentence
[49:05] it's Faith it's Faith uh Faith overcomes
[49:08] all those
[49:09] [Applause]
[49:11] you see faith faith isn't outnumbered
[49:14] do you know I mean it may seem like it
[49:16] but
[49:18] faith is all you need
[49:21] that's all God wants for me
[49:24] amen amen you know and when we are when
[49:28] we go when we read the scripture here
[49:31] you see we see Jesus going into the
[49:33] temple
[49:35] you know and he doesn't like what he
[49:37] sees
[49:38] you know because that was that was his
[49:40] house
[49:41] he said it was his right there
[49:45] amen amen you know I believe Jesus is
[49:47] here
[49:48] I believe that he's here
[49:50] because we invited him
[49:53] you see if we hadn't invited him then I
[49:57] don't believe he
[50:07] or anybody else
[50:16] amen amen you know when we uh and when
[50:20] Jesus doesn't like what he sees
[50:22] you know he starts taking care of
[50:24] business
[50:26] you see I believe Jesus he's the god of
[50:30] action
[50:32] he's just not going to tell you about it
[50:35] but he's going to start doing
[50:37] but he only do
[50:40] what you ask him to do
[50:43] you invited him here she's telling me
[50:45] talking then he's here
[50:47] if you invited him in your house
[50:49] then he's going to do
[50:52] what you asked him to do is
[50:55] in your house amen amen you know I was
[50:59] uh watching it's been a while back
[51:02] you know but I'm sure it's pretty
[51:04] familiar
[51:05] you know I believe uh you know some
[51:08] people they run marathon
[51:11] maybe you know a lot of Christians don't
[51:13] run you know physical marathons
[51:17] but you know I believe that you know if
[51:19] we run a marathon
[51:21] maybe you know you run that marathon on
[51:24] Netflix
[51:27] amen amen you you you run those kind of
[51:29] marathons
[51:32] you know and I believe that you know
[51:34] many of us do that
[51:37] you know it's I mean it's pretty quiet
[51:39] in here
[51:40] okay you know but uh but you know it's
[51:43] the reality of things
[51:45] but one of the things that you know I I
[51:47] one of the shows that I've actually seen
[51:51] is is one of the shows called the
[51:54] hoarders is
[51:58] you know and those people you know
[52:00] they're uh compulsive hoarders
[52:05] amen amen I just wanna I just wanna um
[52:08] just so you know what uh the word
[52:10] compulsive means
[52:14] what the definition is
[52:16] it says it's a resulting from or
[52:19] relating to an irresistible urge is
[52:27] especially one that is against one's
[52:30] conscious wishes
[52:36] amen amen do you know I mean so they
[52:39] don't want to do it
[52:41] but it's just irresistible
[52:43] you know you just just can't hold back
[52:46] you know this body just enjoys it is
[52:55] you get the sticky fingers
[52:58] you know you you get caught
[53:02] you put it down for a little bit
[53:04] sometimes it's kind of hard to let go
[53:06] yeah
[53:20] you know it's it just sticks to to this
[53:23] body is
[53:26] but you know these these hoarders
[53:30] you know they just like the they like to
[53:32] uh they're compulsive
[53:35] did you think those don't like to let go
[53:39] you try to take something from him
[53:42] and they always feel like they they have
[53:45] to have it
[53:47] they have some kind of emotional
[53:50] attachments
[53:53] it's just it's just an emotional
[53:56] attachment it is
[54:03] you know and uh it stops just starts
[54:09] you know and it starts piling up in
[54:12] their house
[54:14] and you know they just don't have the
[54:16] time
[54:18] to uh maybe clean up
[54:21] so you know it might start in the closet
[54:24] uh you know we have any Shoppers around
[54:26] here
[54:28] but you know because there's a
[54:30] compulsive Shoppers
[54:34] you know made as well as women
[54:38] it works both ways these days
[54:41] you know and you could buy things and
[54:44] you don't even take the tag off of it
[54:48] you know it's it's just there yeah yes
[54:50] sir oh you felt like you needed it
[54:53] you thought it might look good on you
[54:57] but it could be there for months
[55:00] and you will forget about it
[55:03] sometimes you don't wear it
[55:05] yo you forgot you had it
[55:08] you know but it's just
[55:56] and then you know it gets a little
[55:58] shameful sometimes
[56:00] you see because things have gotten a
[56:03] little bit out of control
[56:05] you know you haven't been able to handle
[56:08] them
[57:06] you
[57:08] know that's the way
[58:08] they don't know what they told you
[58:09] foreign
[1:00:00] he doesn't want to be in that field
[1:01:04] those things
[1:01:17] he can bring you out
[1:01:21] Hallelujah
[1:01:25] Gloria the old version says this
[1:01:28] in the message enticing spirits
[1:01:35] he says let go of the world
[1:01:38] is
[1:01:47] but the problem says how do you let go
[1:01:51] so many people are wondering today
[1:01:57] how do you let go
[1:02:00] I know you heard a lot of theology on it
[1:02:06] a lot of people much
[1:02:11] trying to let go
[1:02:13] many people come around and say I'm
[1:02:16] going on a 40-day fast so we can do
[1:02:18] something
[1:02:23] you need to let go of the world
[1:02:26] and all these devilish things
[1:02:35] oh she's got to be taught how to do this
[1:02:38] let's do it by jumping up and down
[1:02:44] a 40-day
[1:02:47] Adventists
[1:02:58] Glory that's what we do you want to get
[1:03:03] somewhere with God
[1:03:08] it doesn't have to be completely yeah
[1:03:20] it says the baby baby I cannot put him a
[1:03:25] shirt on
[1:03:26] by himself he needs to be guided
[1:03:31] he knows that his arm goes in there
[1:03:35] it goes in the sleeves
[1:03:41] you
[1:03:44] say so you know it's baby
[1:04:10] that's what the Bible says
[1:04:13] amen amen that's how you do it
[1:05:16] God will receive
[1:05:23] he wants everybody
[1:05:30] wants your life
[1:05:32] we want your testimony
[1:05:35] he wants every minute you live
