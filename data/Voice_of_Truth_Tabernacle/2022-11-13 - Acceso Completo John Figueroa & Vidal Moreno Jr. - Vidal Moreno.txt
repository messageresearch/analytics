see you God and I noticed with a news of death a body that's deteriorating and there I fell on the floor and I began to ask God to forgive me impossible I began to ask God for forgiveness because I didn't want to die yesterday I knew there was a hell and my life was in danger of how far the devil took me because I disobeyed God and there I was he will not despise or turn away all of a sudden I hear I knock out the door an older man that I've never seen okay never seen this man foreign he was a chaplain at the hospital he was telling me um he says young man I I'm finished in the hospital and I'm going home but as he was leaving the door God speaks to my heart and he tells me stop [Music] go inside that room that's there is that I have the last word that I have the last word that if he repents from his sin he said William me and turns back to me I will take him away from this I will heal him and I'll make him a preacher of my word wow because I didn't fulfill him something so material or something material a simple car Hallelujah yeah we're here beloved you're thinking God glorified God help me I had Open Hearts 24 years ago not manifested in a mighty way and he took us out of the hospital and ever since we've been preaching the word of God wonders of God telling the people there's nothing impossible but it's necessary to get here to stop ourselves our differences and serve God forgive each other as God demands in his word thank you [Applause] you could just open your Bibles and just stand for a few moments to the Book of Jeremiah chapter 30. verse 12 is the 13 verse our theme is restoring the bride and for a title John and I mean we titled it all access amen amen and we're just going to leave off where our pastor left off last week or take off where he left off we had Jeremiah 30 verse 12 and 13 reads like this [Music] it says for thus said the Lord thy bruise is incurable and thy wound is Grievous there is none to plead thy cause the thou mayest be bound up thou Hast no healing medicine for I will restore Health unto thee and I will heal that's this is verse 17. yesterday will restore Health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy wounds said the Lord because they call the an outcast saying this is Zion whom no man seeketh after this uh you know uh I'm pretty I'm pretty excited I'm a it's actually the first the first time I've actually brought a fellow alignment to church yeah and you know um I think maybe some of them seen me on online or something but you know the first time it's always special you know I remember uh you know the first time my wife took me to church I remember my mentality was well I was I wanted to go because I wanted to make her happy okay yeah but you know at the end of the day you know I was like you know she needs help but you know I I think I was the one that that needed the help he was he was after me a lot of times we're always you know like hey man they need help we're actually the ones amen amen and you know when we talk about you know a brother Titus left off on the Brokenness you know how uh you know the bride needs to be restored you know brother John's a testimony you know him having to go to the doctor in order for uh for for the help you know that he actually needed you know the circumstances of life I was actually reading something that [Music] [Music] while mentally emotionally morally socially and spiritually well so we can have all those you know we could we could be spiritual sick but we could be fine in that area and then it says this is and and sickness in any other combination [Music] so you know when you're emotionally and spiritually not well that actually carries over into your physical body and then you're not understanding what's happening how you could be physically well but you know emotionally or your state of mind it's not in the right place oh you know you you're trying to find some help you know sometimes people go to the psychologists sometimes they go to the co-workers you know so dear friends you know or just somebody out there you know they're trying to find help you know a lot of times they can't find it you know but I know uh you know I think we come to a place you know what we can find where we know where the hell is no I think that when we come up here you know we're here to help oh we should all be here one another you know in one way or another we were called here you know to strengthen one another foreign amen amen you know and when we sit there and we we talk about healing you know I think you can't speak of healing without speaking about Jesus amen amen you know in Revelation chapter three an apocalypse is stress now verse 20. it reads like this very familiar scripture it says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice you know I believe Jesus is knocking Jesus and uh you know one of the things that the restoration is our business that's what we do oh we restore restaurant you know and one of the things that we have to do a lot of times you know we would at least I don't like to do it is that you know we have to go knocking on people's doors I like to go knock it on doors because I don't have a very friendly face if I was the person inside I wouldn't open the door I'd be like man I you better call the cops you know because I don't have a very friendly face and you know I think uh you know when when somebody comes knocking oh you know we're living in the time where you know you can see who's at the door without opening the door you know we have all this Electronics all these cameras I mean I could be uh I could be 300 miles away I could see the Amazon package Amazon you know right there at the door you probably change your whole mood don't tell Alex to go get it he will leave it out there but anyway the thing about it is that you know we sit there and we hear the door knocking you know I go knock on somebody's door and uh you know they don't answer in novren and uh you know I I always ask myself I wonder if somebody's in there no because if they're not if they if they are there and we and we kill the power I guarantee you they'll come out I guarantee you they'll come out we went to a place one time we were in Denver and Denver and we had to we had uh we had to open some fuses we got to go ahead to go open the fuses we started we all started laughing but watch everybody's gonna come out like that was like like 100 people that came out well at first the door would not be open you know somebody was knocking against you know and they wouldn't open the door and as soon as the power is gone electricity you know then everybody comes out I want complete heal when you amen amen foreign and uh you know one of the other things that happens when they don't answer is that uh you know the the power is gone there's no lights it's funny how people come up yes and all of a sudden you know they can't breathe I can't breathe they've been on oxygen I went to a place one time and there was like 10 people like maybe like nine out of the ten they they were they needed oxygen to breathe yeah I'm wondering if they were that they weren't being they weren't able to breathe because you know maybe there are social media life was uh was it was an intended for the moment so your life you know I got no Facebook foreign what we do is we have to start a call in and locate just just say like like I said it is you know different parts we have to locate gas we have to locate water we have to locate Communications we gotta locate all kinds of different things [Music] that actually go to your home you can see so that we don't hit it so you know we we we have to call that in before we can digest that's the problem a lot of times you know they don't want to give you access you see there's people that don't want to give Jesus because I want a transformation okay [Music] you know all the places where you have hidden yeah there's gonna be a change you know people don't like to do it you know and there's all kinds of excuses excuse us right now the ground's too hard man I can't dig man look at me I'm weak Papa Jesus is [Applause] this is part of the problem because your dad hits you foreign [Music] a lot of times the fault you know it's you've you always look for it out there somewhere else foreign terminando give him accessible to everything you'll be limping your way through life foreign never fully knowing what complete health is never fully knowing who God is do you allow him to bring the healings you know the actors you know if if we have any kind of Revelation revelation and if you're new and if you're not it's it's all the same we all need Jesus we all need help you know he purchased he purchased us you know so a lot of times he shouldn't even have to ask him have he purchased you if he's your savior if he's your healer if he's your God he shouldn't have to ask but he's the gentleman with or without you he's still God he's God with or without you if you reject the healing he's gonna find somebody else that will accept it we're the ones missing out you know when when when we talk about complete restoration we have to give him all access when you have all access to something you know it's just something glorious you know you you get there's no restrictions there's no restrictions because there's no restrictions exactly who he is if you give him the chance you give him the opportunity I'm going to read a quote by brother Brian just what will you give God says I'll give 15 minutes on Sunday morning if you
