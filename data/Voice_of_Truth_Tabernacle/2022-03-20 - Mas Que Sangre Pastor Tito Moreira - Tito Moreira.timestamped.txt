[26:22] foreign
[26:49] help me turn the heater off
[26:53] i feel like i'm going to suffocate here
[26:57] and then brother isaac's going to have
[26:59] to step in
[27:01] ruth chapter one elema is
[27:07] the subject is restoration restoring our
[27:10] position
[27:12] in the book of ruth
[27:16] historia we're going to be studying the
[27:18] story
[27:25] [Music]
[27:30] but the two main characters in this
[27:32] story
[27:35] is ruth
[27:36] and boaz
[27:39] so repeat ruth
[27:40] and boaz
[27:44] ruth is a type of us root representative
[27:48] ruth represents the bride of the lord
[27:50] jesus christ
[27:53] and bro boaz represents the lord jesus
[27:56] christ
[27:58] but in the first chapter boaz doesn't
[28:00] come
[28:26] now it came to pass in the days when the
[28:28] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[28:30] the land
[28:39] and a certain man of bethlehem judah
[28:41] went to sojourn in the country of moab
[28:43] he and his wife and his two sons
[28:48] this man is the husband of naomi
[28:53] and the name of the man was elimelech
[29:11] and the name of his two sons
[29:21] of bethlehem judah and they came into
[29:24] the country of moab and continued there
[29:31] and the limitless naomi's husband died
[29:33] and she was left and her two sons
[29:45] and they took them wives of the woman of
[29:47] moab the name of the one was orphan the
[29:49] name of the other ruth and they dwelled
[29:51] there about 10 years
[30:13] and naomi said turn against my daughters
[30:14] will he go with me are are there yet any
[30:18] more sons in my womb that there may be
[30:20] your husbands
[30:51] but it says here turn again my daughters
[30:52] go your way for i'm too old to have any
[30:54] husband i'll have nothing to give you
[30:57] yes
[31:02] and they lifted up their voice and wiped
[31:04] again and orpha kissed her mother-in-law
[31:06] but ruth clave unto her inaudible
[31:14] and she said behold thy sister-in-law
[31:15] has gone back unto her people and unto
[31:17] her gods return thou after thy
[31:19] sister-in-law respond
[31:30] to
[31:37] and ruth said and treat me not to leave
[31:39] thee or to turn from following after
[31:41] thee for whether thou goest i will go
[31:43] and where thou lodges i will lodge thy
[31:45] people shall be my people and thy god my
[31:47] god
[31:48] let us pray senor jesus christ lord
[31:50] jesus christ
[31:58] a safe place
[32:12] because we desire
[32:24] help us take another step higher
[32:52] clearly i don't have enough time to
[32:53] finish today
[33:20] [Music]
[33:27] above all it tells us that god is more
[33:30] than a cancer
[33:32] he has more than blood nosotros for us
[33:47] jesus christ himself
[34:31] as much as we bury
[35:13] i am his
[35:28] i don't know why we're very similar to
[35:31] elimelech's family
[35:34] naomi's husband
[35:37] feliz they were happy
[35:40] do you know how i know they were happy
[35:41] san feliz viviendo
[35:51] bethlehem meaning the house of bread of
[35:54] god
[35:56] in judea bethlehem was a city in judah
[36:00] significa
[36:03] and judah means
[36:05] significant worship established
[36:09] they were in the house of bread of god
[36:12] con adoracion with the worst
[36:15] of worship in their lips
[36:19] not only that but their names
[36:23] tell us how happy they were in this
[36:25] place
[36:28] means god is significant
[36:31] naomi means pleasing
[36:37] her first son malone significant
[36:52] how they felt many
[37:06] alive
[37:08] of happiness
[37:12] how easy is it many times
[37:16] to step out of the place that god has
[37:19] different and seek something different
[37:23] that's what happened with them
[37:26] in israel they were in israel
[37:28] [Music]
[37:29] and bethlehem judah
[37:33] there was a famine in this place
[37:46] that if they depart from god
[38:29] right away we're trying to find
[38:30] something to entertain us
[38:33] instead of waiting
[38:38] on him
[38:43] finding something different
[38:47] yes sorrowful times
[38:49] cristiano every christmas
[38:52] specifically
[38:54] every place
[39:12] has he not been faithful
[39:45] [Applause]
[40:22] always has
[40:36] we
[40:51] [Applause]
[41:04] in times of affliction and difficulty
[41:08] we ought to say to the devil
[41:11] just wait
[41:13] just hold on
[41:15] hold on
[42:11] of the descendants of law abraham's
[42:13] nephew
[43:38] just
[43:50] and during those times
[44:03] because another one takes his place
[44:18] [Music]
[44:20] we're
[44:34] is
[44:58] sometimes we have more trust in someone
[45:00] else than god
[45:02] another
[45:16] but we flee
[45:24] died
[45:36] and then the satisfaction died
[45:44] one at a time they died
[45:47] in satisfaction they were found
[45:49] unsatisfied
[45:52] that's all the world does
[45:55] that's all the devil does
[46:10] and takes everything
[46:13] [Music]
[46:25] and there was naomi with her two
[46:28] daughters in-law
[46:33] until she understood she had to return
[46:36] and then
[46:39] she understood she didn't belong there
[46:42] and india
[46:45] she understood if she received something
[46:49] if she were to survive
[46:52] she had to return to her home
[47:52] a very respected historian of the
[47:55] hebrews
[47:59] believed that ruth was eglon's son in
[48:03] the book of judges
[48:18] the bible
[48:25] one of the tribes of benjamin that
[48:27] killed them are left-handed
[48:30] but he was a king of moab
[48:41] it was very likely that she was the
[48:43] daughter of this mobile king all right
[48:45] now imagine my hidden
[48:58] is
[49:27] had nothing to do with israel
[50:24] natural
[50:35] [Applause]
[50:37] [Music]
[50:53] your family in the flesh
[50:59] i believe we should watch or take care
[51:00] of our families
[51:02] oh jesus christ
[51:05] who is my friend
[51:24] is
[51:47] hallelujah
[51:54] [Applause]
[52:03] [Applause]
[52:07] [Music]
[53:42] [Music]
[53:53] lord jesus christ
[54:15] [Music]
[54:20] is
[54:29] [Music]
[55:18] will
[55:26] [Music]
[55:46] apparently
[55:49] [Applause]
[56:33] [Music]
[56:59] neither is male nor female for ye are
[57:01] all of one christ jesus
[57:04] what a tremendous revelation
[57:07] that it does not depend on your language
[57:38] important
[57:59] [Applause]
[58:20] and the book of ruth is a very beautiful
[58:22] picture
[58:24] of christ
[58:28] ruth went over in a strange country
[58:33] speaking about naomi
[58:48] when she
[59:16] return to your country
[59:30] brothers
[59:48] [Applause]
[1:00:12] found out that you're more than your
[1:00:13] people
[1:00:15] it's more than your place
[1:00:18] it's more than your flesh yes
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:01:08] now watch
[1:01:10] regresan
[1:01:13] in chapter 2.
[1:01:16] they come to israel
[1:01:21] and naomi
[1:01:35] there's a field of one of her kinsmen
[1:01:39] marientes
[1:01:40] kinsmen of her family
[1:01:42] avion campo there was a field
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:48] and there was a lot to eat of
[1:02:18] and the reason why she was saying that
[1:02:22] was because she knew boaz was the owner
[1:02:27] and she knew if he maybe saw her
[1:02:31] if he may be sold
[1:02:58] and she was after them that were reaping
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:28] to the
[1:03:42] because
[1:04:09] is
[1:04:38] who
[1:05:06] that's
[1:05:46] but it goes here
[1:06:02] was an angel
[1:06:36] [Applause]
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:07:23] why do we have a problem with someone
[1:07:25] being a chief or being in charge
[1:07:29] why does it bothers us that there's
[1:07:31] someone in charge
[1:07:34] people hear about brother branham
[1:07:36] and it bothers them that we speak about
[1:07:38] brother brannon
[1:07:41] because many churches don't speak about
[1:07:42] brother branham
[1:07:45] but god says
[1:07:50] it's in the bible
[1:07:52] holy ghost
[1:08:07] is
[1:08:36] in
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:48] so god is asking accounts to the
[1:09:04] and he says she's been laboring
[1:09:13] forgive me i'm not gonna get to what i
[1:09:14] wanted to but there's no problem
[1:09:33] that was said over the reapers whose
[1:09:35] damn soul is this
[1:09:42] campos
[1:09:43] and the servant that was said over the
[1:09:44] reapers answered and said it
[1:09:47] it is a moabitess damsel that come back
[1:09:50] with naomi out of the country of moab
[1:10:00] hasta
[1:10:03] and she said i pray you let me glean and
[1:10:05] gather after the reapers among the
[1:10:06] sheaves so she came and had continued
[1:10:08] even from the morning until now that she
[1:10:10] tarried a little in the house
[1:10:13] let me tell you this pleases guys
[1:10:16] this is what please
[1:10:20] please
[1:10:22] she didn't surrender
[1:10:27] that she was
[1:10:54] i tried to receive something
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:22] thou not my daughter go not to glean and
[1:11:24] feel in another field neither go from
[1:11:26] hence but abide here fast by my maidens
[1:11:34] now i'm gonna skip a couple things to
[1:11:36] get some of my points
[1:11:38] chapter three
[1:11:52] her mother-in-law said unto her my
[1:11:53] daughter shall i not seek rest for thee
[1:11:55] that it may be well with thee
[1:12:07] and now is not boaz of our kindred with
[1:12:10] who's made himself lost
[1:12:22] therefore and anoint thee and put thy
[1:12:24] raymond upon thee and get thee down to
[1:12:25] the floor but make not thyself known
[1:12:27] unto the man until he shall have done
[1:12:29] eating and drinking
[1:12:41] and it shall be when he lies down thou
[1:12:43] shalt mark the place where he shall lie
[1:12:45] and thou shalt go in and uncover his
[1:12:47] feet and lay down and he shall tell thee
[1:12:48] what thou shall do
[1:12:52] now notice the story
[1:12:57] ruth tells naomi what happened
[1:13:02] there's much more to mention on chapter
[1:13:04] 2.
[1:13:05] but i won't mention it today
[1:13:10] and then naomi
[1:13:12] says
[1:13:14] he is our kinsmen
[1:13:16] eliza
[1:14:07] you protected it because remembering
[1:14:09] judges many came to steal the harvest
[1:14:12] so
[1:14:26] and
[1:14:40] or was it that jesus
[1:15:08] in la cruz
[1:15:32] hello
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:51] consummato with his garment
[1:15:54] with his raymond
[1:15:57] so when he goes and rests
[1:16:00] she covers herself
[1:16:13] she covers herself with the same holy
[1:16:15] spirit covering him
[1:16:17] says brother branham
[1:16:24] and she understood what she was asking
[1:16:26] for
[1:16:28] he wanted to
[1:16:30] he wanted him to redeem her
[1:16:57] there's someone with the right to redeem
[1:16:59] you necesito
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:18:23] of this flesh
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:37] i want to tell you this
[1:18:44] our boaz
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:19:03] he is more than blood
[1:19:07] [Music]
[1:19:15] is more than the fleshly desires we have
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:35] as much as our fleshed houses
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:41] now we want the things of this world
[1:19:44] us
[1:19:46] [Music]
