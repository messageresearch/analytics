people so we can pass the wi where better make the change right now than later amen thank you Brothers those that are standing can open your Bibles those amen it's it's to be able to to have communion with you I believe you are my family you are my family I believe when Jesus Took the communion he did it with his family he did it with those disciples who loved him and they loved him and he loved them want to let you know that I love you it's good to be here in this place with you book ofosa we're gonna take the story OFA a very wellknown story God put it on my heart for this evening and go we knowa was a prophet of God and we know Goomer was a prostitute a harlot and and God gives an order to a very odd order we're going to try to focus here brother are well try to focus chapter one verse one if you find it did you find it the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea the son ofi in the days of Uzziah jotham ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of Judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of johash the king of Israel the beginning of the word of Lord by Hosea and the Lord said to Hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredoms for the land had committed great whoredom departing from the Lord so he went and took G the daughter of duim which conceived and bear him a son amen I want to read one more scripture First Corinthians 11 First Corinthians 11 verse 23 it's a very sacred time special time it was so special for the Lord Jesus Christ and it should be special for us as well we should take it with much seriousness which and much sincerity brother speaks on the message communion he says when we come to communion we should do itely vers 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord Jesus let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you not as people that are perfect but people that need of your blood people that need to be remembered of Your Love toward us Lord we put ourselves in your hands as the word flows and as we take this communion with you that there would be Souls being restored Souls that are repented sincere there will be sick being healed people being delivered even people receiving the Holy Ghost we know that you do we believe you will do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated just a few moments we want to speak with the thought return to him and stay return to him and stay now when the Lord Jesus Christ instituted uh the communion when he said that this would be one of his ordinances he said that when we did it we would remember of him that we would do it in his memory it's as if God knew that we would need times to remember God knew that we are very e very easily forget how many acknowledge that we remember very easily or for we forget what he has done for us our mind begins to slip very easily back into the things of the world or the things that are not good for us and God says I will provide a way to REM you to remind you how much I love you to remind you where your true home is I believe that's what the communion is about it's about remembering who our first love is who is the OWN of our hearts who's the one that deserves our worship who is it brother it's our God it's the one that died for us the one that gave it all for you and he is the one that deserves it and I'll go back to the story of Hosea a little bit and of [Music] goer the name goer it means completion or end I believe that we need to get to the point we're completely certain of who the Lord Jesus Christ is for us think on that because many times we're not 100% sure and that's why he has to remind us once againa being a prophet of God we know the story God tells take a woman I imagine he saw a vision of of him getting married with a woman named Goomer when he saw that Vision he was probably surprised how a man of God like him that had desired to marry a pure woman had desired to raise his children in a let's put it this way a Christian Home in a a home that was God-fearing imagine he saw his life knowing a woman clean a woman that loved the Lord a woman that kept herself for God a prophet an example for the people in that in that town imagine he thought when I get married I'm gonna marry someone that loves the Lord like me that we could both serve the Lord together and raise our children be an example to this nation yet when God shows him the vision I imagine that when his heart began to break when he saw that Vision his dreams be were shattered he was like what is this how is it I will marry this Goomer she is a harlot but God has a way to convince us God has a way to make us see that it is all plan of God it all happens with a purpose and most certainly after he had wrestled with god with his thoughts to feel something for this woman he said maybe my love will convince her maybe the way I treat her will convince her maybe if I show her an unconditional love she won't be the woman that she is Imagine You began to feel something for her when he went to her father when he went to deim to ask for her hands the father he probably left he said how are you is it that you're going to want my daughter how are you going to want her imagine he thought it was some kind of mockery and he insisted so much says if you want it like that then so be it take let me tell you when God looked at us he accepted a problem he accepted the challenge he accepted a person that was broken full of flaws where the heart wasn't in the right place accepted a problem like me he accepted a problem like you let me tell you we've been a problem for God I imagine when Hosea began to draw near unto Goomer imagine he would just be looking at her and she would say why is this man looking at me like that when a man looks at me he just thinks about my body he just thinks about the pleasure but he's not thinking about that I can see it his eyes see beyond my body beyond my spirits beyond my errors something different he's not looking at me with eyes of lust there something different here how beautiful it is to know that there's somebody that sees you different oh Church there is somebody that looks at us different there's somebody that looks beyond what we can do for them but he sees that what he can do for us isn't it good for you to know that there's somebody who sees you with so much love he doesn't look at you seeing your or thinking of your flaws what that may have done for Goomer imagine she said there's something wrong with you when he said goer I want to marry you she said oh there's something wrong with you you're not thinking right you're not thinking things through don't you realize who I am I imagine the only reason she wanted to marry him or she married with is because he was so insistent or persistent he insisted so much imagine she said well fine then I imagine Brothers we've come to the feet of Jesus not with a complete heart we've come because oh they insist so much they preach and they preach and they preach it's fine to accept the Lord Jesus sometimes we do it but we don't do it with a complete heart do because well he's the only one that asked me to marry him imagine if she didn't do that because he insisted so much but I believe in her heart she perhaps felt that that wasn't an error how many of us at one time or another have said why am I in church why did God choose me he must he probably made a mistake I believe there's more than one of us here that are like the Publican that was beside that Pharisee and that Publican must have felt Lord forgive me because I'm not like him but forgive me because I'm not like the ones that serve you here have you ever felt that way you ever said oh Lord forgive me I don't know why you have me here not like these holy people I'm not like these people that deserve your love they deserve your love but I don't deserve it Lord imagine that first days things may have been a little tense at home but yeah he did all he could to make her feel comfortable so that she would relax a little bit how much has God not done so that we would be comfortable how much has he done because when we accept him many times we're still not certain many times we really haven't given our hearts completely to him it's like as we say yes but in our heart we know still thinking and pondering on other things we still want other things we still desire other things yes or yes Brothers our heart is not completely his we're like just looking around to see what happens God says God does all he can to make us feel comfortable oh Brothers how much does he not do do to remind us to tell us you're my son I love you you are my wife I love you in us that says it can't be that it can't be why would he do this for me it can't be this is strange this has been a mistake it's a mistake to come to church it's a mistake to that you have me here with these people but he did all he could so that she would be comfortable perhaps there was a there was there were times where it appeared like everything was well she was relaxed a little bit and she said well maybe this is mine maybe there is the future here maybe I am the the the bride maybe he did choose me maybe he does love me so much like he tells me imagine just as those moments would come they would begin to fade away when she began to think on her other life she began to think in a more comfortable life a life with more luxury imagine one day when she was going out to the market one of her friends Drew near to her and said go go guess what look at those men there they come from Arabia they are wealthy men filled with money and they are ready to waste it they are ready to give you what you want they are ready to have a good time look come let me present them to you come over here perhaps wasn't expecting it but little by little she began to get involved in that moment to see these men with cologne cologne and expensive clothes began to speak to her he began to make her for her to go back to imagine her past life just like the devil does he bring he seduces us once again heces us again he he says remember remember yes or yes Brothers when she Le suspected she had a cup of wine in her hand she was tasting it again the days passed and she did not return home Hosea was looking for her he looked for her for days just like God seeks us out just like he looks for you you say well I'm in church that doesn't mean your heart is his your heart could belong to something else or someone else your heart could be half here and half in another place you haven't given him everything and he goes once again and he goes and and looks free even if they mock him everyone in that town they all knew I imagine they they they looked at him and they felt sorry for him asking him why did you set eyes on her why do you continue to look for her why does God continue trying with us why does God keep trying with me why does he keep trying with you even when we ignore him even when our heart is hardened even when we put other things before him even when we give more to other things of the world than him even we when we ignore him when it doesn't even matter to us what he said why does he continue to look for us I ask myself what the people don't say they wouldn't say of O why do you continue to seek her out just forget about her imagine the devil telling God why you keep looking for them he loves me more than you why do you continue trying I want to tell you he continues trying he continues looking for you he continues remembering you reminding you reminding you you are my bride you are my son I love you come back home give me your heart completely go would return home for a few days perhaps some months as she was pregnant well she couldn't do her job right she would stay home but her heart still wasn't there and when she had the children it feel good good again she would begin to think again imagine that within her she would say why can't I stay why can't I be faithful perhaps it's a question we've asked ourselves why can't I be faithful why can't I do what I know I should do have you ever asked yourself [Music] that why if he loves me so much he's taught me so so many times he's showed me his love he's done all he can for me why can't I be faithful to him why do I look for someone that's going to use me instead of someone that loves me why do we look for the things of the world when we know that the world doesn't have anything good for us why do we spend so much time on on watching things we we know we shouldn't watch listening to music we shouldn't listen to having romance with the devil when there's someone that truly loves us when there's showed us Time After Time Imagine That goer was not fully convinced that perhaps she still thought it was a mistake she said well he can't love one love someone like me you that say oh what do you say no yeah you said it right in the first time you that say he can't love someone like me I want to tell you he didn't not make a mistake with you I repeat he did not make a mistake with you if he brought you here it's because he wants you here because he's [Music] willing to do whatever it takes until you know how much he loves you so you can be a woman or a for him for a wife without spotter he is willing to do everything he can he did not make a mistake with you and he reminds us again even with all of your mistakes he REM he reminds us again even with all your mistakes I still love you and he'd be willing I'd be willing to give my life again for you and I'd be willing to bleed once again for you and I'd be willing to come again suffer be alone Be criticized all to love you and I remind you again the great love that I have for you because we forget very easily because we go back very easily because very easily we go back to our life without him Hosea 141 says oh Israel return unto the Lord thy God for thou H has fallen by thine iniquity OAS you had to remind her time and time again and God reminds us time and time again uh come back come back to a a true Christian Life come back and fall love with me once again give me your heart again stay I believe that's the most difficult thing it's your decision make your decision make your final decision you've tried to live a halfway with me you know it doesn't it doesn't take you but to worse and worse things to the point where you become a slave and God says return son return to the my love return to me make your decision again make a final decision give that stay with me the musicians can come forward to sing a song we would please stand for a moment when Goomer would return she probably returned smelling like wine alcohol smelled like a men's colog her heart hardened I ask myself if there's not some of us here who come smelling like sin smelling like the world smelling like the things of the world but he extends his arms and reminds us the nails that pierced through his hands we see his blood uh coming out of his forehead ASAS the nails the the uh stickers adorns his face unrecognizable and he wraps Us in his [Music] love he says you're still my love you are what I died for you are the reason that I [Music] suffered you're the reason that I continue knocking at your door I continue calling even if your heart is hard I still call you even if you come to church and you give me a half worship you go back home and you go back to the same you haven't completely given me your heart but I've given it all to [Music] you I've give you my heart entirely I give you the best of of myself what more do you want to be convinced of how much I love you come and wash yourself in my blood come and wash yourself in my blood and I will make you like [Music] new and if your uh if your sins were red like crimson they shall be white as [Music] [Music] wool [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] Hallelujah [Music] more he [Music] [Music] you're [Music] [Applause] [Music] for [Music] and well [Music] men oh

for me while I pray for you for this is the family you have given us help us to accept one another help us help one another how many times shall shall I forgive my brethren 70 Time s how many times as my brother act or my sister I'd like to go how many times should we receive him again as many times as necessary just show them love just show them the love of God the love that God has shown you this is the family God has given me we can be full of Errors full of errors but there's always a place when we come back home there's a place there's somebody somebody says welcome brother we love you help me love my brothers with with all of their flaws help me not not be bitter towards them keep anger oh Lord I imagine Hosea uh leaving his house when Goomer would come [Music] back he would grow go out and and and cry out and he would [Music] cry getting out his anger with God to not let it out toward her and sometimes I come with you god and I say why why are we like this Lord why are we so ungrateful but this is the family you've given me these are the ones you've given me help us love one another to forgive one another these small portions they are genuine bread made without condiments and and and other things which represents the body of the lord it's not round broken in all pieces it's because that means it's broken body that was broke for us may God grant His blessings to everyone that eats it now it is not the body it only represents the body I have no power no one else does to make it anything but God alone that's what he told us to eat this bread and drink this cup of wine I would ask for them to um pass the bread and the [Music] wine don't eat it uh when you get it just yet we will be partaking of it together this bread is the body of it represents the body of the Lord it just doesn't represent his broken body because before his body was broken his heart was broken but that it would represent a broken body it would a broken heart for us if you won't partake of it don't worry just don't take it be careful with the wine and if you need grape juice you can get grape juice the rest is wine think on him for a moment think out what he wants to remind you of what does he want to remind you of this evening perhaps you already forgot all that he's done for you maybe you forgot that he how many times he told you he loved you maybe you've forgotten of his Mercy how many times he's picked you up how many times you've been ready to quit and he has sent something to pick you up for someone to pick you up maybe we've forgotten [Music] of his benefits what it is to be in his presence how beautiful it is to [Music] feel if you're not going to take it don't worry don't grab it but maybe we've forgotten what it is to be in his arms maybe we forgotten the promises we made unto him why don't you take a moment to remember remember what you would be without him where would you be without him where would you be if he had not saved you where would you and I be what would be of our lives without him we wouldn't know what true love [Music] [Music] is [Music] fore and [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] came [Music] oh oh [Music] s oh [Music] most holy God
