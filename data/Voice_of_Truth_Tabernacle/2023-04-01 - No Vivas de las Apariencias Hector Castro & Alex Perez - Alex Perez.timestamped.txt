[24:00] Hermanos
[24:30] via the Internet
[24:38] we'll continue with the book of Samuel
[24:46] when you're happy if you please say Amen
[24:49] is
[24:52] in this evening a great privilege for
[24:54] the brother Alex
[24:57] was given as a title
[25:02] don't live by the appearances
[25:15] glory to God
[25:17] this is
[25:37] first Samuel chapter 16 verse 1 says and
[25:40] the Lord said unto Samuel how long will
[25:42] that mourn foresaw seeing I have
[25:44] rejected him for reigning over Israel
[25:46] fill thy fill thine horn with oil and go
[25:49] I will send thee to Jesse the
[25:51] bethlehemite for I have provided me a
[25:53] king among his sons
[26:19] he will kill me and the Lord said take
[26:22] and heifer with thee and say I I am come
[26:24] to sacrifice the Lord verse 3 and Call
[26:26] Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show
[26:28] thee what Thou shalt do and thou shalt
[26:30] anoint unto him whom I have name unto
[26:32] thee
[26:36] we're going to pray
[26:39] Santos lovely Heavenly Father
[26:43] evening father
[26:46] Jesus Christ
[26:51] of my mind and what I will speak
[26:54] can you make me aside
[26:58] use me fast so I can express your word
[27:02] bless the one I hear that's the one that
[27:04] speaketh
[27:08] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[27:12] seated Brothers
[27:20] a little bit on the word of God
[27:24] is
[27:28] that Sammy went with Isaiah
[27:35] to anoint the new king and don't say
[27:38] this is
[27:46] because the Lord has sent me to anoint a
[27:49] king
[27:52] down a little bit I'll jump to verse six
[27:54] this is
[28:03] and it came to pass that when they were
[28:05] come and he looked on a lab and said
[28:08] surely the Lord anointed to him is
[28:10] before him before him
[28:12] who said that
[28:14] Samuel
[28:15] said
[28:17] he was a prophet of that time
[28:23] but Samuel was also guided
[28:27] with this natural side that sometimes we
[28:29] Thomas
[28:31] that we're looking at the appearance
[28:36] don't live by appearances
[28:43] he was also wrong
[28:46] he saw him and saw that it was him
[28:51] and in verse 7 it says
[28:57] Mira
[29:03] Mira el hombre pues
[29:12] or in the height of a statue because I
[29:15] have refused him for the Lord see it not
[29:16] as man see it for the for a man look at
[29:19] on the hour of the prince but the Lord
[29:20] looketh on the hearts Gloria
[29:24] so we're seeing there
[29:27] que Samuel that's Samuel esta mirando
[29:29] was looking
[29:31] just as at his appearance
[29:34] how many times have us
[29:37] have we been wrong foreign
[30:19] means
[30:53] we're more worried
[30:58] we're not then what we are foreign
[31:52] when we go eat
[31:56] even the food
[31:59] so we're taking pictures
[32:03] you can see what we're eating
[32:06] oh good thing yes
[32:13] we're taking pictures
[32:24] we want to live by appearances
[33:00] we live by appearances
[33:44] or on the sidewalk
[33:47] apartment
[34:08] we don't even know who the owner is
[34:14] because we're living by appearances
[34:36] because we're always living by
[34:38] appearances
[34:44] the word of God says
[34:47] in Galatians
[34:51] foreign
[35:29] [Music]
[36:05] but Brothers
[36:21] we can hide from him
[36:23] Gloria dios glory to God
[36:31] I can see here
[36:35] is
[36:37] also living by appearances
[36:45] country
[37:35] they say
[37:38] is
[37:51] and they made that David get mad
[37:56] that's when you start
[38:00] the jealousy starts
[38:04] I love it
[38:07] when try to try to give glory to David
[38:09] they said
[38:12] so he got jealous
[38:17] Jesus in this thing the name of Jesus
[38:20] there's nothing in that correct
[38:24] what did God do to him
[38:28] evil spirits
[38:32] say hey David
[38:35] Without a Cause
[38:40] David could have turned his neck or
[38:44] slayed him a couple of times
[38:47] but he only let him he never said
[38:51] anything else
[38:53] he could have done it
[38:57] he went over there and cut a portion of
[39:00] his
[39:04] and
[39:07] he said look here see
[39:09] Saul
[39:47] also follow him all the time to kill
[39:49] David
[39:54] OS glory to God
[39:59] when David was anointed
[40:03] he took the kingdom
[40:06] he had to wait
[40:09] and many times
[40:11] we have to wait
[40:14] instantly
[40:20] right amen
[40:25] sometimes Brothers we act beforehand
[40:27] foreign
[40:50] vamos
[40:53] and when we go with our pastors
[40:58] and we say oh look I'm speaking to this
[41:01] young girl
[41:05] that she's not a good woman for him
[41:08] what does the youth do okay
[41:15] I want this is
[41:21] my advice here is that you don't marry
[41:23] but you you will serve for the
[41:25] consequences don't say no no
[41:28] uh
[41:33] listen to their password to their
[41:35] parents
[41:36] many times the consequences
[41:40] they get married to the young man or
[41:43] young lady that wasn't
[41:45] but what happens in time no sentient
[41:48] they don't understand as problems
[41:52] dramas happen
[41:54] and then they come with the pasture
[41:59] or my husband and then they go with God
[42:02] is
[42:12] listen to the voice of your of your dad
[42:16] you didn't wait for God to respond
[42:19] because we're not ready to listen or to
[42:22] wait
[42:23] in one occasion
[42:46] stand on it
[42:51] he went to go see his garden estaba
[42:55] is
[42:59] a branch with spines and and
[43:02] there was a warm walk uh going through
[43:05] there
[43:07] he said God this is not what I asked you
[43:09] foreign pray
[43:56] respect
[44:13] Grace okay
[44:18] but many of the people that are not from
[44:20] the fields they don't know how to Grace
[44:24] is when a woman
[44:27] eats is they
[44:42] they regurgitate it
[44:45] and begin to eat all the nutrients that
[44:48] we had
[44:53] that's how many times I think we should
[44:55] do with the word of God when we come
[44:57] here we eat it
[45:01] and we're over there at the house
[45:11] to take all of the nutrients because
[45:14] many times we let it pass Us by Gloria
[45:17] dios glory to God
[45:27] God bless you
[45:28] [Applause]
[45:35] man
[45:36] age
[45:38] this precious evening
[45:40] God bless the youth is there
[45:47] it's been a while since I got to speak
[45:49] to the youth is
[45:52] so I feel very happy to be able to
[45:55] um
[46:10] and I'd like to go a little deeper into
[46:12] David
[46:14] um
[46:18] I think a lot has been spoken on his
[46:21] victories I'd like to go a little deeper
[46:24] and perhaps go into some of his failures
[46:30] for thinking a little on David uh
[46:38] [Music]
[46:58] there are certain things that stand out
[47:00] that I can see
[47:02] um
[47:03] uh
[47:04] estamos mirando in in Lucas
[47:09] the story in life of David he
[47:13] is
[47:15] one of the things that stand out is
[47:21] the people of Israel saw a leader
[47:24] is they look for a king
[47:28] they wanted the king that was
[47:31] they wanted the king but it wasn't the
[47:33] way that God wanted a king
[47:36] they wanted a leader or a king
[47:41] that was like the king of the rest of
[47:43] the Nations
[47:50] that was outstanding
[48:02] the
[48:13] Bible says that he was a man who was
[48:15] very tall
[48:35] he was very attractive
[48:38] he was a perfect leader you'd choose
[48:43] mirando
[49:46] that this is a true leader
[49:49] man that's right
[49:53] looking at these uh two great characters
[49:55] here
[49:57] and I call it
[49:59] because he was safe it's always saved by
[50:03] grace
[50:05] pero
[50:09] we're looking at David a little youth
[50:15] difference
[50:17] I can see the differences in what God
[50:20] looks for in a person
[50:22] man looks on the exterior of man
[50:27] and God looks on the inside of man
[50:30] es you know youth brothers sisters
[50:35] we live in a time okay
[50:39] where everything is
[50:45] social media is a great platform
[50:49] for you to live a false life
[50:58] where you can live a life of appearance
[51:07] you can hide who you truly are you
[51:11] an appearance of being someone else
[51:16] is
[51:17] we're living in a very tremendous
[51:21] when I analyze the life of David
[51:27] he didn't care about the exterior
[51:30] much attention
[51:32] he didn't really look too much on how he
[51:35] looked
[51:36] at
[51:38] if he had paid attention to them
[51:45] your armor doesn't fit me
[51:48] make me one that does fit me
[51:57] David would have been concerned about
[51:59] his exterior appearance
[52:01] he would have worried
[52:06] what are you doing here
[52:09] why are you here
[52:12] are you confronting this great Giant
[52:16] maybe he would have gone discouraged
[52:18] personas because the people
[52:21] that are based on on hearsay or what
[52:24] people say
[52:32] about me
[53:02] very spiritual
[53:19] is where we show our true colors
[53:27] scratcher your person
[53:30] and you'll be able to to right
[53:39] and they're going to show what's inside
[53:41] of them
[53:44] appearances
[54:19] I see a man
[54:22] who was worried
[54:27] he lets his jealousies to invade his
[54:31] life
[54:33] I see a man
[54:36] who is
[54:38] worried
[54:41] because his kingdom is falling apart
[54:44] yeah
[54:46] yeah
[54:48] instead of seeking God
[54:51] instead of saying
[54:53] where have I failed
[54:56] me Lord tell us
[55:02] I know I didn't hear your voice
[55:10] instead of going to God
[55:13] he gets jealous of a young man
[55:15] appearances
[55:26] when I dig into the the person that
[55:28] David was
[55:29] I see a man
[55:32] important
[55:34] the most important thing he desired in
[55:36] his life is
[55:39] to have a relationship so close with God
[55:48] when we get to such a great desire
[55:51] a desire
[55:54] nothing else matters
[56:00] [Music]
[56:07] all right
[56:10] it doesn't matter what the people say
[56:14] it shouldn't matter to us
[56:22] who appear to be someone
[56:26] and one of the reasons is
[56:29] because of their self-esteem it's so low
[56:35] that are jealous to their own shadow
[56:39] who is this guy
[56:42] [Music]
[56:45] there are people like that Brothers
[56:49] there are other people that
[56:51] buska
[56:53] Vera Associated
[56:56] Society or a group of people
[57:00] that happens in church
[57:10] so I'm gonna pretend I have money
[57:13] there we are all in debt
[57:16] [Music]
[57:21] we don't have
[57:22] [Music]
[57:24] man wow
[57:26] oh and there's no no Korean suvida no
[57:28] foreign
[58:05] many people try to evade their realities
[58:07] the real parts of them
[58:10] and they appear seruna Persona to be a
[58:15] person
[58:18] but they know within them
[58:21] that they're not that type of person
[58:28] s
[58:31] this evening
[58:35] all of us at some point in our lives
[58:37] have tried to pretend something
[58:40] okay
[58:42] it's happened to me a lot of times
[58:47] I remember when I went to interview for
[58:49] a job
[58:51] I dressed very nicely
[58:54] and I tried to speak as best I could
[58:57] in the direction
[59:00] and I was going towards the interview
[59:04] I'm not going to stutter yeah
[59:09] and when they told me
[59:11] what can you off for this company I said
[59:14] what
[59:30] I'm not gonna fight him
[59:35] I want to find someone to fight him
[59:42] to confront that giant
[59:46] it's a bear to be sincere
[59:50] I am a sinner if I
[59:57] lord I can't get to you
[1:00:04] But Here I Am Lord
[1:00:07] look at David
[1:00:09] he was such a tremendous man
[1:00:14] that he says his words
[1:00:19] who can understand his errors
[1:00:22] and look at what he says
[1:00:26] close me thou me from Secret faults
[1:00:30] in other words
[1:00:37] so keep or to fix his errors
[1:00:41] that they were dark
[1:00:45] those things that you say oh it's not a
[1:00:47] problem
[1:00:48] but it is
[1:00:51] a man with Integrity towards God
[1:00:54] it's very sincere

[1:03:50] deep into his character
[1:04:00] how
[1:04:05] the little things matter to him
[1:04:12] another trajectory another stage of his
