one we're gonna start there I hope we are ready to learn some facts tonight I found some interesting things about solomonas and I'm going to save the best for last because I didn't even know this either to me yesterday but first Kings three one reads [Music] and Solomon made Affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David and so he had made an ending of building his own house and the house of the Lord and the wall of Jerusalem roundabout salomoni so foreign second Corinthians 6 14. and when you have a can you say amen and God's word says unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion has light with Darkness let's make a quick prayer brother Lord heavenly father thank you for this hour Lord how are you prepared to speak your word Lord is bless our hearts and our ears with your wisdom father and with your Revelation Lord Revelation and Lord anything that is out of its place put it in its place and help my brother Sammy and my brother Alex as well help the audience presents in the name Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated we're still on the character of Solomons and they told me I had extra time tonight I usually bring more more things than I should say and this time I brought a smaller message I also brought something up my sleeve if we can say like that [Music] foreign it's just so we get to know Solomon keep knowing him some things that Solomon is known for Salomon is for his wisdom he was the wisest man on the planet Solomon ruled for 40 years and that was Israel's Golden Age Israel who is at the peak of its power is Solomon was the third king of Israel 20 years old I found out and he died right before 60 or at 16. and I was studying of all his possessions and approximately today in today's economy Solomon would have had an excess of two trilliones two trillion those three units a Fortune of two trillion dollars we I mean we get excited over one million I'll never see a million um but Solomon could have pero Salomon 2 trilliones it was a very wealthy man the most wealthy man Salman built the first temple as we all know he has 700 wives as they told us last Friday including the daughter of pharaoh included he didn't have enough with 700. so he wanted a princess amen amen Solomon's sin who knows what Solomon's sin was if you read ahead Solomon's sin was worshiping idols and foreign's Kingdom today he would have his kingdom would have been from Israel Jordan Jordan Palestine Palestina and Syria is Syria that's that would have made a big country so just these are just some facts they told me I had extra time so I wanted to share that with you well back to our scripture they wanted to avoid war there Solomon's borders uh I imagine he wanted peace with Egypt so he marries Pharaoh's daughter and this is where I want to say yes where II Corinthians say look it is be not equally yoked together with unbelievers communion communion light with Darkness yeah personally I get excited about this I don't know why but sometimes when you say something and you lived it it's different amen there's like substance behind it translator so I can say I've been in Solomon's feet or Solomon's been in my steps but as a Christian talking to the youth here knowing that they want to court we all grow up eventually right amen and I just want to give the advice as plain as it can be we have no business but what is an unequal I remember our brother vidad made this reference and a yolk is the idea of two bulls or the other is not even pulling at all you see they are unable to plow in a straight line capacitados and this that's what happens when one follows Christ yes and the other does not are you following me that's what happens I don't know why but lately I I I don't want to stay home lately last year I wanted to stay home but I would still come to church but this year I call like a second wind and now I I just want to be responsible here and that's that's what I want to say that you should be in church and not one at home I understand if there's a health issue but we should walk in a straight line together [Music] especially us that are married God has beautiful sisters God has beautiful daughters and God has beautiful sons amen amen and God has put us together to not look for business out there as Solomon did it says in the message separation from unbelief it says don't yoke yourself up among Believers says many places of the scripture teaches us that we should separate ourselves the first thing that God required Abraham to do when he called him was to separate himself from his people his Kindred and he'd bless him says the holy spirit separates us from the things of the world from the cares of this world [Music] affection set on Christ Jesus Jesus now brother Brandon is speaking about Solomon and Ahab here now [Music] but he says you know the wisest man in the Bible outside of Christ Alone died a healing idolater un incredulo the wisest man in the Bible outside of Christ the second wisest man died [Music] because of a bunch of I'll say it here because of a bunch of Pretty Woman all right I don't know how to say this I don't want to offend anybody especially the ones watching on the internet but pretty women drive us mad I must be preaching to only women pretty women brother they drive us mad you know especially if you're not subjects to the Holy Spirit Solomon pulled away from God Isaac pulled away from God for pretty woman you're you are you guys already saw what I went through for a pretty woman but thanks to God those that love God all things help them for good all things with every trial God will provide the way of Escape it might not be the most prettiest way but it's the way of Escape it might be ugly but appreciate it that it's a way of Escape brother Brandon and I've seen many people come to the platform and be healed and walk away and mix up with unbelievers and their sickness comes right back to them again I've been there brother I don't want to put you on the spot forgive me but I've been here I've been here being prayed for just and then I've went with unbelievers there might be a uh argument there argument but you know some people might say well Jesus was with Sinners they call Jesus a sinner's friend here people come and be prayed to be healed and they go back into the world like if it didn't matter that God healed they didn't keep up with that healing it says in First Kings 11 this is I'll be reading a few verses we're going to speak on the downfall of Solomon Williams First Kings 11 1. but King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh woman of the moabites ammonites of the Nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel go on no verse 2 verse 2 they say um Israel ye shall not go into them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods pretty woman out there they're gonna turn your hearts away from God Alejandro now sisters handsome boys are gonna turn your hearts away from God unless they have the Holy Spirit that's I remember our pastor preached uh some tips if you're looking for a partner like two three years ago ouch Amen brother let's break the tension uh continues reading uh verse 10 years uh forgive me verse 9. and the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel is which had appeared unto him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the Lord commanded now there are consequences brother and here's the consequence wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon because we can have friendships here amen as long as we're in the steps amen but for Pretty Woman muchachas Bonitas because we love beautiful women Solomon went and worshiped their gods because he loved the woman he didn't even love those Gods he loves the woman and that's why he worshiped those Gods but closing now I'd like to focus on why David and Solomon had so many wives have you ever asked yourself it says in the message choosing of a bride notice that we are all in individual bride note making up the bride haciendo a la Novia this might be for the more advanced Brothers says the word says that she was made for man and not made not man-made for her this is she was made for man if I was a woman I was made for man and not man made for her says now I'm going to speak on why in a few minutes on the bride of Christ what I'm trying to show you the background of it says that's the reason under the Old Law was that polygamy was legal yes now listen look at David sitting down there with 500 wives and the Bible said he was man after God's Own Hearts it was 500 wives and Solomon with a thousand but not one of them women now we cannot serve two masters we'll leave one wrong but it says the whole 500 woman was just David's wife now turn your spiritual hearing on spiritual it was a type when Christ sits on the throne in the millennium his bride will not be one persona but it'll be tens of thousands The Pride all-in-one and David had many wives as individuals all of them together was his wife like the whole body of Believers is the bride of Christ is he was the man now right here we were made for Christ we were made for Christo Christ o wasn't made for me we should do some reading but Christo the prophet says wasn't made for me I was made for Christ that's why we tried to do today in our textbooks is to try to make the word which is Christ that's the difference he says instead of us shooting the world it says please say I'll read it to you again which is Christ suit us to suit us it says again because [Music] we were made for Christo this is uh this is maybe it might be too advanced but Dave all of David's wives for the Youth and Solomon's wives they were all just his one wife just like when the Lord sits on the throne he will have tens of thousands but one bride pero una Novia and that's it for tonight Brothers God bless you yes [Applause] amen God bless you since the Lord tonight how many are happy to be in the house of the almighty God amen I'm so happy to see each and every one of you hey man right away if you could please stand if you could please open your Bibles to Proverbs chapter 3 verse 13 and 15. when you have me please and it says like this they say I see happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that Gareth understanding and the game thereof then fine gold Fino Treasures than rubies and all the things that can't desire are not to be compared unto her Mas precious Italian amen Brothers separation from the world you know I think that's a requirement that we need Brothers to be separated from this world you see because if we're not separated you see God can't use us but it takes a separation amen Brothers this night we are focusing on the Bible character King Solomon says here tonight you know many of us all think that we know the whole story of King Solomon [Music] but in reality Brothers we only know the most outstanding things about the life of Solomon like his wisdom but there is a lot more of King Solomon's story that we have to understand who was Solomon you see Solomon was the second son of King David because the first son that David had was with hair that David did not take account of that sin so David tried to cover it says I'm sorry it was by and wise and selfish decisions and you know meditating about this Brothers you know thinking about this throughout the week no there are three things that can sink if I could put it in order tonight number two you see these are the three things that can seek the men of God and here we have a great example we have King Solomon Solomon was a very humble man Solomon was a very simple man Solomon loved the god of Israel you see the Bible shows us that God appeared to Solomon two times God appeared to Solomon twice and in two occasions God spoke with him the first conversation can be seen in first the Kings chapter 3 verse 5. and it says like this is the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night they say David are you in I'm sorry verse 6. this is amen Brothers water and expression King Solomon was making to his father David you see how beautiful it would be que Hermos could express those words of their fathers let's continue reading according as he walked before there in truth and in righteousness and thou has kept for him this great kindness has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is reading verse 9. give therefore thy servant and understanding Hearts to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so greater people amen what a request um and the reason when Solomon the son of David when he took the throne well he never prayed that God would give him so much but just wisdom to know how to govern and hold the people together well now God worked with him and he gave him a gift of discernment true certainly did and he could discern the right from wrong and so forth and the News scattered everywhere throughout all the world of this Grace you see there was no person there was no King there was no one who had more wisdom who had more wealth we had more knowledge then King Solomon you see all of Israel was subjected subjected and the wisdom of King Solomon spread throughout the whole world you see everything Solomon did was done with all the wisdom foreign players Which chapter two I mean not chapter nine Capitol verse two to seven we could see that God speaks for the second time and the Lord appeared to Solomon for the second time as he had appeared unto him and the Lord said unto him I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou Hast made before me I have allowed this house which thou has built to put my name there forever and mine eyes and Mine Heart shall be there perpetually yes and we'll keep my statues and my judgments then I will establish the Throne of thy kingdom upon Israel forever as I promised to David thy father saying there shall not fail the other yes upon the throne of Israel you see David was a king of War you see David had to fought for his land how to fight for everything was the king of peace and while David prepared everything Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem [Music] but listen here Brothers it says in here in chapter six but if ye shall at all turn from following me oops and will not keep thy Commandments and my statues which I have set before you know go and serve other godses and this house which I have allowed for my name is and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people Israel you see God promised him that not only will he give him the wisdom and knowledge of right and wrong we also promised him wealth and riches you see in the days of Solomon the scripture shows that he carried that he carried ships that were imported to him that carried thousands of kilos of gold and Silvers you see the scripture says that Solomon received about 25 tons or 50 000 pounds materialistic materialista gracias that the Bible says now Solomon enforced the people to pay heavy taxes just for the construction of the temple you see but this wasn't this wasn't all in uh Solomon's downfall era you see Solomon's downfall was in idolatry and women amen Brothers the Bible shows us that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines imagine that Brothers if I could see Brothers here they could barely last with one aquilos Hermanos just imagine Solomon with 1 000. amen Brothers but eventually as time El and their hearts turned from God you see and eventually Solomon's heart was turned away from God too you see although Solomon knew what was right from wrong his wife still somehow convinced this to build high places could worship their Pagan deities and that resulted in yes you see but at some point Brothers you see Solomon was tired of the wealth you see Solomon was part of the success foreign are given to the sons of man to be exercised there with verse 14 I have seen all the words that are done under the sun and behold all is Vanity vexation of spirits you see this caught my attention because with Solomon with all that he had all that wealth imagine our brother Isaac said it himself two trillion dollars he felt sure of himself this is what happens Brothers with the majority of people who maybe have achieved wealth Fame and success they try to find satisfaction through pleasure material possessions materials through their pride and fame ifama understanding this Brothers the problem that we have is that we are always looking for something that satisfies us we always want to try to achieve something to feel like we are somebody big foreign everything is you see we will not find satisfaction in the things of this world this thing only has temporary things you see Brothers Solomon was part of the things he did Under the Sun I like that expression Under the Sun and sometimes we are living a life Under the Sun you see and Under the Sun we are living a life of Cycles we come to church three times a week we come to church and sit down we all we aren't satisfied with what we heard we are satisfied with the music so we just make it a habit or a routine and leave church the same way we came but brother sometimes something we fit we fail to realize where we are right now all of this Brothers here is eternal life and we cannot lose it because we are living in a time where we are under the sun you see you we have a purpose in this world we have a purpose in which why we are here but sometimes we misread our purposes because if all that we want to do is save money is and educate ourselves and be bigger than others but we will take we will have we will take quite a time to find our purpose whether that means riches or fame they will never find it you see both the wise and foolish um will eventually die wisdom wealth and fame or temporary and they will be forgotten but here is eternal life here is something Eternal you see the problem with Solomon is a Solomon had pride in his heart pride is the one of the reasons why there are problems in homes relationships and families you see brother Branham says that this is happening in churches too is Brides in churches the churches all across the country you see look at all these denominational churches they are pastors and that Pride themselves and having big churches big audiences having the best musicians having the best preachers you see the brothers the prophet says you see that's words of curing to all the churches around the globe there are churches they have preachers that stand in speed about little things without any importance in reality instead of preaching repentance to the people and bringing men and women to the altar look at what these denominational people are doing they don't want to preach about repentance they do not want to tell the sisters how to dress like a true lady because these people what they want to preach it's something just to satisfy themselves the majority of denominations have left the the and the hell to build according to the thoughts of man and what these people do now they preach prosperity and a message of make me feel good but I give thanks to God for the messenger that he has given usage because I believe that the greatest thing that somebody could have is God in their hearts I believe that it shouldn't be important how good of a musician how good of a Preacher how good you are at certain things you see but the most important thing is to have Christ in our lives that makes a difference in this world but it takes separation it says a separation from this world so that we may live a life that pleases God you see because because without him we wouldn't be here right now you see Brothers we have maintained this church Voice of Truth for over 10 years supporting you with our offerings and sales but it is by God's grace that the church is still standing Brothers it's by God's grace that we are still here you see God has been merciful to us we are still here by his grace and why not give him thanks tonight I want to read a quote by Brother Branham if the musicians may please pass and it says like this the king got to a place that he thought within himself that he got lifted up cried God in his heart and that's what's happened to us if you're part in this expression but that's what's happened to our churches throughout the country they're fine people in there some of the best in the world goes to church I think the best in the world goes to church but the thing of it is the organization system gets lifted up and that's what's happened to the Methodist that's what has happened to the Baptist that's what happened to the Nazarene to the pilgrim Holiness to the Pentecostals little self-willed self-willed and self-centered upstairs try that you can't tell nothing to God can't find a way to get in their hearts it's because they become so know it all that nobody can tell them anything and by building themselves around reasoning with Brethren foreign got lifted up if you may please stand Brothers Solomon fell in love with the material things you see Solomon was so self-centered Salomon era centrico rather than Christ Center Cristo centrico his obsessions with his own words let him to ignore his desperate desperate need for something you see what he needed was the blood of Jesus Christ and we need the blood of Jesus Christ Brothers you see we don't need material things we don't need the temporary things of this world we don't need what this flesh desires because without it we have nothing nothing you see the Bible says that we were not Redeemed by the things of this world but we are Redeemed by his Precious Blood maybe tonight maybe youth maybe tonight we may find ourselves with pride in our hearts maybe tonight we find ourselves not satisfied with what you heard tonight maybe tonight we feel distant from God baby tonight we find ourselves in desperation but brother Brandon said the only way to find God is when we take off our pride it takes a separation so that God can use us you see it Brothers he is here tonight and if you're looking for Redemption he wants to cleanse us Brothers meditate with him [Music] why don't you worshiping tonight somebody can say Jesus yes Jesus and Jesus oh they're just [Music] sisters [Music] yes savior oh and [Music] oh and oh [Music] after
