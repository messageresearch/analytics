[21:05] [Music]
[21:14] [Music]
[21:32] [Music]
[21:41] good to see you once again if you'd open
[21:44] your bibles
[21:48] to the book of revelation
[21:51] chapter two
[21:53] oh boy everyone is doing well
[22:40] receive greetings from the brothers from
[22:41] bakersfield javier jose
[22:46] delgadillo
[22:50] ingredients to all the congregation
[23:05] because that thou suffer
[23:07] christ
[23:09] which called herself a prophet
[23:15] to teach and to seduce my servants to
[23:17] commit fornication to eating sacrifice
[23:19] unto idols
[23:45] [Music]
[24:01] the name of our lord jesus christ amen
[24:03] amen
[24:04] you may be seated
[24:07] amen amen
[24:10] glory to god
[24:14] we're speaking on the diet here at
[24:15] church agenda
[24:30] a little bit in
[24:32] attention on the temptation
[24:35] it says here
[24:38] it's not what's in the outward standing
[24:40] have a few things against
[24:43] quesadillas
[24:50] that woman jezebel which calls herself a
[24:52] prophet is to teach and to seduce my
[24:54] servants to commit fornication and to
[24:56] eating sacrifice into idols
[25:12] dominion
[25:17] about the emotions and the feelings
[25:21] they control us
[25:23] [Music]
[25:26] and that's why i want to focus on that
[25:27] word of seduce
[25:30] because it goes with everything that
[25:31] we've been talking about
[25:37] there's nothing or nobody
[25:54] like a woman
[25:57] that's what the prophet says
[26:00] and then it says
[26:05] there's nothing or nobody that can be
[26:08] used to deceive like the woman
[26:14] now the reason that i believe
[26:19] that the devil likes to use the woman
[26:21] [Music]
[26:28] [Music]
[27:34] his emotions or his feelings
[27:38] and he's not so much led by the emotions
[27:40] or feelings
[27:43] now i'm not saying that is better
[28:02] [Music]
[28:13] h
[28:16] and he speaks on on jezebel
[28:20] and then he quotes santiago
[28:22] james 1 14.
[28:33] it says but every man is tempted when he
[28:34] is drawn away of his own lust and
[28:36] enticed
[28:39] now brother speaking on jezebel
[28:52] then he keeps reading in the book of uh
[28:53] james um
[29:02] [Music]
[29:12] but every man is tempted when he is
[29:13] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[29:25] then when lust has conceived it bringeth
[29:27] for sin and when and sin when it is
[29:30] finished brings forth death
[29:32] then brother brandon begins to speak he
[29:34] says
[29:35] this is now in in the verse
[29:45] it's not on here but hey no
[29:48] say it again
[29:52] okay uh i mean now that is a picture of
[29:55] exactly what is happening
[29:57] [Music]
[30:06] now that is a
[30:07] picture of exactly what is happening in
[30:09] the church ages
[30:14] sensation a sin started in nothing but a
[30:17] feeling
[30:19] now repeat after me i'm saying this
[30:23] is a sim and so started
[30:27] with a sensation
[30:31] the sensation is the same as an emotion
[30:34] comment
[30:46] so the death of the church started with
[30:48] the simple little notice deeds of the
[30:50] nicolaitans
[30:52] from the one to a doctor
[30:59] from the doctrine it embraced the power
[31:01] of the state and the introduction of
[31:02] paganism
[31:05] now watch what brother says
[31:10] it's an emotional sensation
[31:26] [Music]
[33:26] [Music]
[33:37] he's a prophet of god
[33:39] so that he would come and tell you the
[33:40] truth
[33:45] he always comes and tells me something i
[33:46] don't want to hear
[33:49] when well
[34:03] and he said i saw israel scattered upon
[34:05] the hills as sheep that have no not a
[34:06] shepherd
[34:08] and the lord said estos
[34:10] these have no masses
[34:14] let them return every man to his house
[34:16] in peace
[35:00] fall at ramos gilead and once said on
[35:03] this manner and the other said on that
[35:05] manner
[35:08] now when brother is speaking on the
[35:09] scripture
[35:10] in the book of kings
[35:12] the one we just read
[35:14] i hope you've read
[35:25] the prophet micah saw that there was a
[35:26] conference in heaven
[35:39] and there came forth the spirit brother
[35:41] brahm says that it came from hell is
[36:00] i will go forth and i will be a lying
[36:02] spirit in the mouth of all his prophets
[36:09] and he said thou shalt persuade him and
[36:11] prevail also go forth and do so ladies
[36:19] what was happening with these spirits
[36:38] temptation
[37:02] trying to make us fall
[37:16] behold the lord hath put a lying spirit
[37:18] in the mouth of all these thy prophets
[38:40] but every man is tempted when he is
[38:42] drawn away out of his own lust and
[38:43] entices
[39:12] um
[40:04] you have to not desire anything
[40:07] because suffering
[40:29] there's a great suffering all right so i
[40:31] told people the classes as a sales
[40:33] there's all kinds of desires
[41:11] so my question is what are you desiring
[41:15] what are you desiring
[41:46] open in the ears when we hear something
[41:48] that we want
[41:51] our mind is very open
[41:56] when the enemy comes and tells us
[41:58] something that we want to hear
[42:05] [Music]
[44:06] he had everything
[44:34] the attributes he had in him
[44:39] there wasn't something outside of him
[44:40] that he desired
[44:42] there was something in him
[44:45] that was already in him
[44:48] nosotros we
[45:23] [Music]
[45:29] if they're unhappy they'll be unhappy or
[45:31] married or single
[45:34] a man or a woman will not make you happy
[45:38] deceives us
[45:44] exterior
[45:56] has everything he needed
[46:13] within us
[46:15] yes sir
[46:18] his word
[46:22] is already in a son or daughter of god
[46:25] but the devil um leads us to believe
[46:30] us that we need certain things
[46:34] isn't that right brothers
[46:38] or that
[46:39] is a dilemma that's the problem
[46:43] that's why we suffer pores
[46:45] that's why the devil tempts us
[46:48] let me tell you
[46:50] the blessings of god no son exteriors
[46:52] are not external las vegas
[47:08] [Music]
[47:22] yes
[47:36] but
[48:02] hallelujah
[48:14] [Music]
[48:18] so many times
[48:20] we get very fanatical no no sir we
[48:22] stress out we worry we worry
[48:26] we we worry so much
[48:28] por las cosas for the things
[48:33] exteriors external things
[48:40] you realize that's where a
[48:42] seduction enters
[48:45] because there are things that you want i
[48:48] deserve
[48:49] there are desires you have
[48:54] that are not of god
[48:56] your desires
[49:13] i need to make sure that you understand
[49:15] what i'm telling you
[49:17] the devil tempts me
[49:21] because i'm desiring
[49:26] external things
[49:42] church or wherever
[49:45] i'll get me that it will make you better
[49:49] and the people are desired
[49:53] human beings it's it's for them to they
[49:55] want to be somebody
[52:02] is
[52:14] deposited within us
[52:17] [Music]
[52:27] it's a perverted desire
[53:11] you can see all that god has placed in
[53:13] you
[53:15] you could see the beauty
[53:18] that a daughter of god has
[53:21] within
[53:25] the equalities
[53:40] to be the
[53:53] did you know that
[54:08] the most holy
[54:22] it's not the external things
[54:25] what makes a woman beautiful
[54:30] it's the what's within
[54:35] this
[54:36] it's not the building
[54:37] says brother branham
[54:39] no es el corro it's not the choir no
[54:43] type of preaching
[54:52] of the renowned name that make the
[54:54] people of the church great
[54:57] it's the character says brothers
[55:00] it's the character de la iglesia within
[55:03] the church oh the odds oh
[55:18] beautiful
[56:30] that makes them beautiful oh hallelujah
[56:32] hallelujah
[56:35] [Music]
[56:39] what good does it do woman
[56:42] you
[57:09] brothers
[57:22] we give so much effort
[57:34] and we don't put an effort towards the
[57:36] things that they don't see
[57:52] that's right
[58:45] [Music]
[59:01] he said him on the brandon brother
[59:03] branham says
[59:05] when the when the bride realizes
[59:08] can i say who she is
[59:36] [Music]
[59:57] [Music]
[1:00:12] my daughter
[1:00:29] [Laughter]
[1:01:03] other things
[1:01:04] [Music]
[1:01:33] comes from what we're desiring
[1:02:21] the feelings are like these prophets
[1:02:28] the bigger the group
[1:02:31] must see less the easier it is
[1:02:37] that's why the devil uses the
[1:02:39] organization
[1:02:43] that's when everybody's believing the
[1:02:44] same thing
[1:02:45] you know
[1:03:42] he hates
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:08] instead of the holy spirit
[1:04:49] he speaks a lot on controlling our
[1:04:51] tongues
[1:05:06] many
[1:05:11] we don't have control of it
[1:05:16] but if you are hanging around with
[1:05:17] people that gossip
[1:05:34] that speak about the word of god
[1:05:37] sooner or later you're going to like it
[1:05:49] effective that's why the organization is
[1:05:51] so effective
[1:05:56] because when they're all saying that the
[1:05:57] the heavens are red
[1:06:01] you begin to ask yourself why do i see
[1:06:03] it blue
[1:06:04] malcolm is there maybe there's something
[1:06:06] wrong with me
[1:06:08] is is it right
[1:06:09] is this it ready
[1:06:10] is it red
[1:06:15] there's something wrong with me is
[1:06:43] they were all saying the same thing
[1:06:55] that spirit just disperses
[1:06:57] very easily
[1:07:11] our feelings
[1:07:38] they don't value you here
[1:08:48] you are tolerating
[1:10:14] temptations will come to all of us
[1:10:18] even jesus was tempted
[1:10:24] the problem
[1:10:28] is that we give him we give him the
[1:10:30] other place
[1:10:32] we we hold him there
[1:10:36] rectangle
[1:10:37] i retain the bad thoughts
[1:10:55] of
[1:11:31] that's where the problem is
[1:11:34] tolerance we are tolerated
[1:11:52] i believe in attacking bad thoughts
[1:11:54] how are we going to attack them
[1:11:56] with the word of god
[1:11:59] what god says
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:13:02] and
[1:13:03] [Music]
[1:14:26] must grant me there's a greater desire
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:32] there's a greater desire
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:40] in the depths of my heart
[1:14:48] that tells me
[1:14:54] i have something better for you
[1:15:00] better than anything the devil is
[1:15:02] offering you
[1:15:05] i have something better for you
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:14] [Music]
[1:15:33] listen to what i have for you
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:49] there's a desire for god
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:17] [Music]
[1:16:46] the beauty of god
[1:16:47] [Music]
