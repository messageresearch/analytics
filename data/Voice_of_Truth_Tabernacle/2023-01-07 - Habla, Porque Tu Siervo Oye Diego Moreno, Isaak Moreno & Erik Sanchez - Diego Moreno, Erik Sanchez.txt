[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] for he has done great things for he has done great [Music] amen God bless you certainly good to be in the house of God once again amen if we can open up our scriptures the book of First Samuel uh chapter one verse one better through five amen hasta Cinco amen if you could say man when you have it amen I'll go ahead and read it and it says like this it says now there was a certain man of Ramadan zofim of Mount Ephraim and his name was elkana the son of johoram the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuff the an F right efrateo and you have two wives the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other panina and penina had children but Hannah had no children and this man went up to up out of his City yearly to worship into sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts and Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hoffney and Phineas the priests of the Lord were there foreign portions suparte but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord has shut up her womb I'm not enough amen you can have your seeds may the Lord has a blessings amen we're going to be talking about a new Bible character amen we're going to be talking about Samuel remember I believe that if we're going to talk about salmon we have to talk about his mother amen amen so I'm gonna be touching a little on Hannah Amen in the let's get right into it amen amen so we see here that Hannah was steriles amen and what does it mean for a woman to be sterile for a woman to be sterile it means that a woman is incapable of producing life amen there's something in our body that doesn't allow her Ayala to carry a child the way that a Other Woman do amen and I was doing a little bit of research on the sort of emotions that the sterile women go through sometimes Amen in a couple of them a couple where they feel incomplete they feel like a failure they have low self-esteem they have self-pity uh uh lastima and they have lots of Hope for future happiness amen experience amen and all of these attributes are are characteristics that go to somebody who's unfruitful amen and amen and we see that Hannah wasn't the first thorough woman in the Bible amen some of the two there were two more prominent people that were also sterile all right and there were Sarah and Rachel amen amen the only difference was that that's uh the way that Hannah reacted to being sterile Unica difference amen lost faith in God when she found out she was terrible and then she took matters into her own hands amen [Music] and Rachel became jealous of her sister and she also did the same because she gave her servant to Jacob remember nonetheless all these women desire children amen but I found something interesting is that the Bible says that Sarah the Bible never states that Sarah Rachel turned to God but they turn to their husbands or to their own ideas amen so it kind of made me wonder how they turn to God had they turned to God then perhaps they could have had more children or children early on Amen uh but that's how Hannah differed from these two and man because the two women before Hannah tried to take matters into their own hands however Hannah gave herself to God and he showed Hannah that God honors a faithful heart amen see it was God that shut up Hannah's womb from the beginning that she shut up he shut up Hannah's womb from the beginning it doesn't say that Hannah was sick or does she had any kind of medical condition [Music] all of the Bible specifies specific is that God show up Hannah's womb amen now that gives me the impression that she was a perfectly healthy woman but that God was just putting her through a trolley amen and why why does God put us through trials sometimes God puts us through trials to turn us to God or for God to come to us amen or sometimes trials motivate us to cry out to God [Music] other times they lead for us to personally examine ourselves amen and they draw us to his word amen praise be to God amen amen amen I believe that we're all like uh Hanan that we all desire life amen amen but life is only found in in one place amen and sometimes it's hard to find but it's it's hard to find but it's everywhere amen amen life is found in God and in his words amen praise be to the God Amen amen and it also says here that that um Hannah's husband had another wife her name was Hannah's rival era the Bible flat out says that that there was tension between these two women is that we're inevitably gonna run into opposition whether or not we look for it'll be there amen amen a couple of examples amen Moses and Israel Moises with Egypt uh Nehemiah and the builders they they also were discouraged by the local people amen and even the Lord Jesus the most perfect human being also had opposition amen amen praise be to God amen now if you keep going in the story of Hannah you find that Hannah went that uh he she went as far as she could to obtain Samuel amen amen so that just asked the question is how far are we willing to go to obtain life Hannah went to give herself completely to God even the very thing that she wanted the only son that she would have ever had she was willing to give it away man it shows that Hannah loved God it shows that Hannah's desires were for God Amen what God was going to give to Hannah Hannah wanted to use to give back to God Amen amen so then what do we do with what God gives us do we give it back to God do we glorify God with what he's given us amen that's why we don't that's why we don't receive sometimes amen because our motives aren't right amen brother Branham says in the message Fellowship he says the right mental attitude towards any promise of God we'll bring it to pass amen he says if you'll take the right attitude that is God's word and God is behind his words and the word is God it'll bring to pass what it says so as long as it's in God's Will and as long as your heart is right and aligned with God's will is amen then there's no reason to worry about whether or not our prayers are answered amen she might have never had Samuel amen Samuel and David might have never gotten anointed and that would have went on down the line yes but to the Lord Jesus amen amen praise be to God amen and one last thing before I close is that when Hannah wants to go pray in the temple not only did they think she was weird because they thought she was drunk amen but but something really caught my attention when I began to read her prayer and it's that in the middle of Hannah's you know sobbing and crying out to God is that Hannah asked to be remembered of God amen I think that's enough if God doesn't ever answer a single one of my prayers as long as he remembers me that's enough amen amen it brings back to mind the teeth that was next to Jesus but all he asked for was that he remembered him amen I just want to be remembered amen how many want God to Remember You amen I think all of us want God to remember us remember do we remember God Amen do we remember God only when we're in need only when we're in church when do we remember God Amen if you want God to remember they remember him let him be the first thing that you think of when you wake up and the last thing that's on your mind before you go to bed and I guarantee you that all of us will be over there one day together amen God bless you [Applause] hey man how many are excited to be here amen hey man I'm excited right now man I don't want to see the things of God like a burden anymore we usually see things of God you see when I have to be asked to preach I see it as a burden I have to study I have to spend time with God a lot of times we don't want to do that we should already be doing that but I'm excited right now don't have a good attitude towards the things of God Samuel's attitude man God bless you Brothers sorry I'm just excited getting excited about the things of God I hope you guys are excited too hope you guys aren't here just to feel uh our title for tonight or speak thy servant here is and as a subtitle I've put who are you running to a quienes amen our my brother Diego spoke a little bit about Hannah Samuels Samuel's mother Madre de Samuel is there a woman that couldn't have a child amen but God's word sunk into her heart she knew by faith that she was going to have that child amen I just want to read um first Samuel 3 1. El Tres Uno and it says like this and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open there was no open vision is the word of the Lord in those days was rare amen yes um says and it came to pass at that time when Eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax them that he could not see yeah and for verse 3 I want to read The New International Version because I didn't understand it at first the Lamb of God had not yet gone out and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord where the Ark of God was estaba and when I read that and it says the Lamb of God has not gone out yet a lot of times in our lives we think the lamp of God has gone now the lamp of God has not gone now yet amen I heard a quote is he said as long as you're not get dead God is still amen and then um I just want to speak on that verse one right there you see we see that the the word of God in this time was rare amen you see what I think it means by what I believe what it means they had gone so far away from God that the word was just common now see they just had the truth I mean they just had knowledge but they didn't have the truth it was just common things for them to hear the word of God to get information but it was hard to get the truth amen see we get away from God sometimes the word becomes so rare to us we're so cold amen yeah raise our hands we're just coming just to come so let me tell me the times amen a lot of times I just come just to come here well before amen but you know when God really stirs something up inside and you feel that [Music] you see we have so much access to the word of God but it's not the axis that you have anymore it's what type of attitude you have towards the word of God what kind of attitude are you going to have towards the word of God Amen amen have a good attitude or a bad attitude amen see during this fastest I really enjoyed watching my dad so far amen he's not a big um if I could say healthy eater amen I'm not either but um it's funny to see them get happy with healthy food amen and we're talking one day yes he's like I don't want to have a bad attitude towards this anymore I don't want to complain no more I don't want to complain no more and if we could do that for the things of God I'm sure I'm sorry if we could do that for the things we could just have a good attitude towards the things I'm not complaining anymore amen amen you see a lot of us instead of worshiping God we worship our ideas of God and rather than being in a relationship with God and instead and then being in a relationship with God in business started we want God to be a resource amen who is more like a Siri than than a savior amen Siri Siri yeah like on your phone man we just want to ask things of him hey God heal me me hey God I need this hey God give me this but see we never hear God out amen you see and when um Samuel cuando Samuel I don't want to read it all because I don't have much time when God called Samuel you see we see Samuel got up and he or actually hold on sorry I want to read this quote um it's um hear his voice is sorry Brothers I'm just a little excited and I said see we got too many things ahead of the Lord you can't have the prayer meeting because Mr Godfrey Frey is on tonight you can't have the prayer meeting because we love Susie is on tonight or some kind of or some kind of foolish nonsense like that that takes up the time and we don't have time to hear the voice of the Lord and those who do claim to be Christians just kneel down with a little prayer like this kind of homemade Lord bless me and my family and take care of me good night and the next morning rise and say is just guide us through the day God yeah good day we we should wait on the Lord you see we do all the Talking pero figures we don't give him a chance to talk back to us that if we would pray and pray until our soul comes into the presence of God and then just relax and listen to his voice see a lot of the times we can't be healed we can't come out of things because we don't just listen to his voice we just want to ask and ask and ask but when have we ever stopped in silence you just say Lord speak to me see in verse 10 universe but it says and the Lord came and stood and called at and called as at other times Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered speak for thy servant tears see a 12 year old was able to stand still and studies I tell the Lord speak to me amen and you see I wanna I wanna make something clear tonight say that until we treasure the voice of God until we value the time of the voice of God until we make time for God until we consecrate ourselves we can't just be skimming the surface foreign you see I just want to speak a little bit about how Samuel yes he kept running back to Eli amen you can read it when you go home verses 1 through 10. but when the Lord first called Samuel pero La primeroes it says you see and that really impacted me yes because they said he he ran you see they were already sleeping they were probably tired I don't know but I see that Samuel still had that passion amen you see he read you see and a lot of times you know we have that passion but we run to the wrong things you see and I'm glad that Eli finally had the Revelation yes I think the Lord is trying to speak to you and I want to be around people I want to rub against people are going to lead me to God give me good advice they're gonna stir up that gift inside of me so that we can rise as one amen I want to fight alongside my brother Alex but a lot of times we're running to the wrong things we're running to the wrong people amen we're running back to our addictions I wonder why we're so depressed looking at others lives instead of looking at God's life instead of reading the word that will bring us up amen amen amen Hallelujah you see at some of the things we have gone wrong in our lives are some of the mistakes we have made you know it was God stirring us up amen but we keep running back we keep running to things that God was trying to remove from our lives because that's what we're used to amen that's what we're familiar with that is what our mind understands but we need to get out of that out of that zone when you understand that there's bigger things out there you see we need to understand that there's something greater amen you see I was hearing our pastor is and you know when he was preaching on Wednesday he said he doesn't want to raise a lazy Church he's going to be pushing us he's not going to let us rest amen that really touched me yes because sometimes you just want to rest amen sometimes Sunday is the busiest day we have amen we think we're gonna rest but in reality but I realized when he said it's not time to rest Brothers it's time to push forward it's time to push forward that's trying it's time to stir up the gifts inside of us you see but we also a lot of the times when we find out we have a gift you see when I when we have a gift of playing instruments you see my dad says I have a gift of talking to people a lot of times we use it for the wrong reasons you see but we have to understand that those gifts were ours like they they weren't we didn't get those gifts just out of nowhere we gotta understand that God gave us those gifts that God gave you your healing that God gave you your strength amen God gave you the talent that you have amen now I want to finish with this foreign I see something I just want to relate something to like you know a lot of times we're watching videos Amen on YouTube you see whatever you watch um and you know sometimes those ads pop up amen [Music] because they're of no importance to us amen importance you see there's a video of I don't know but they're not they're no importance to us amen the the importance you see we want to get back to the main thing that we're watching we want to get back to the main purpose amen see I feel like in this season of my life I want to do important things amen I believe my calling is valuable and the people that we are with it's important because things are contagious amen I'm sorry the people we are with it's important because things are contagious people telling me what I did last season anymore I don't need people teaching me how to sit on a bench or how to go out into the world but I need them to push me forward I want to ride I want to rise man and I want to overcome whatever's around me I don't got time for those other things anymore I only got time for the things of God and I believe you this is a critical time amen and we have to give ourselves to God we have to run to God and let him speak amen amen God bless you [Applause] [Music] God bless you Brothers how many are happy with the word I think there's uh more than one sister because that can identify themselves with Hannah how many youth can identify with Samuel medium let's open our Bibles first of Samuel chapter three [Music] and all the way to verse 10. first Samuel chapter 3 verse 1. verse 10. [Music] and the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel Samuel then Sam Samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth a second scripture in in Juan Diego's uh in John chapter 10 verse 27 years my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give them unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man plug them out of my hand today I'm muchas there's many voices it's like a war of voices there's voices condemned that they decide to do what's wrong that is scared that suggests that distracted the destructive voices now look there is going back to Samuel 3. here he said that Samuel was a young man he was he was no longer a kid already grown a little bit he was a young man and this is a story writer uh Josephus is around the age of 12. is that around the age of 12. the young man enters into the age the responsibility of responsibility and accountability and I believe this is what happened with Samuel momentum there came that time when he stopped being a kid that had been destituted I have been dedicated to God to be a young man the time of responsibility or accountability and you know yes cuando that's why he has to make a decision when God speaks to him for the four by the fourth time and since Samuel answers I believe at the same time as he responds he will follow God or not and he says speak for thy servant heareth was pointing the initial he was starting to initiate a transformation with Samuel Samuel was the young guy named Samuel Nino that that young man have been dedicated to him now when I was a young man and I believe que dios that God would start to use or better said he was do not use him in a tremendous way in a supernatural way because later Isaac said for a moment there was no vision it was difficult for the people of Israel hear the voice of God but God had something foreign yes you made it now look this is Brother Brown says that a vision is the the direct a voice of God the voice of God in that time to hear God's voice and in that time was something strange it was something scarce how many of us have not been through scarce times imagine that time the word of God was scarce there was no vision there was no vision with uh with frequency the true voice of God was something scarce it was hard to hear someone speak of God why because the people had Departed yes they had a church but I believe his only religion that they only follows the Commandments of Jehovah or would only follow or would believe what they wanted to believe they had a minister called Eli the the Commandments that people wanted to hear and I believe it's a parallel of this these times today we come we only want a hero he wants it here and the pastor calls my attention oh I get angry I want to go to church our pasture they had Departed to hear the word of God with something scarce he and you know today nowadays the voice of Satan makes himself more Audible we today nowadays they paint it this way when you're watching TV commercial and they passed the ad of beer all of the cigarettes or they talk about moderation moderation they say or we give everything to him sorry you know the voice of Satan is more audible that there's no time left to hear the word of God brother Brown says that in those voices is the voice of pleasure to the pleasure of this flesh and we get lost in those other voices the voice of God we distract ourselves the voice of God Santa's bosses so many voices that that trip out my senses we can't distinguish the voice of God look is I will share the story that our brother Brandon tells us and it speaks of this person that would collect gold there in Phoenix Arizona there came a time when he found so much code that from night to day he was made into a millionaire yeah he had barrels and barrels of gold and his point and his his point was to go into that cabin and rest but what he didn't notice that there was other eyes watching him and they were looking at him look what her brother says when he gets to this point to this cabin he was laying in his pillow thinking oh tomorrow I would change these nuggets for currency I will buy Great Cars whiskey and I will drink good whiskey I would do all these things it is and have a big time and I will go to Every dance day dreaming that is he went to the door and opened the door and said shut up and the dog whined he was tied to a leash and he tried to warn his master and he laid down in his bed and again the dog started barking again he would tell him once and again shut up I don't want to hear you I want for me I want a lovely dream tonight of the good times I'm going to have tomorrow when I have cash in my gold and finally the dog barked again he became angry he reached in the corner and got a double-barreled shotgun went to the door with both hammers back and shot the dog down to death said that'll take care of you I won't need you anymore he set the gun down and lay down on the on bed and folded his hands with his dream and fell off to sleep a saber knife into his uh and left with it okay oh what did he do he killed that voice that was warning him not be our stance oh the voice of the Holy Spirit and we see the approaching of the Lord and turning it away to the warning that it gives us amen amen to the warning that it gives us the musicians may come forward oh goodness use it's also a warning voice God is always speaking to us he wants to speak to us he wants you to hear him sorry you know the voice of God is so sweet that even the the birds keep their silence beloved brother let me tell you something God loves you he does not want you to be confused he wants you to know him to know his voice and if you want to go back to have that sweet you mean the spirit and humble Spirit once again listen to The Voice don't go to church they tried to distract you those voices that tell you don't go to the altar what are you thank him for that makes you look weak located in this trailer they want to distract you they want to departure he doesn't want you to hear it he wants to manifest just like he was with Samuel Samuel was still he stayed still yes and he heard that sweet voice God has something big for Samuel for that young man and I believe God has something for you I believe God look I can see it in in uh when I had the opportunity various youths and I could see how you use that one too you don't got to be there could give life those people that needed it the most [Music] [Music] and that's something that I won't ever forget and I'm gonna have it in my heart was that last day yeah we went to go eat I saw a young man over there and they started to help I just started to cry [Music] as you were coming back why because I saw something in you because they received something from Europe because God gave something I believe God wants to use he wants you to be his friend yes his feet just open your hearts [Music] let that sweet voice speak to your heart and don't kill that voice God bless you [Music] [Applause] [Music] since [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and I would like to start it with something special [Music] something that is not normal can you

you give to everything that this is what's the best thing you could give to our God and our Prophet says the best thing you can give God is to get to surrender your life completely not just your life your but your body soul and and life and spirit and then and live for nothing [Music] at 12 years old gave everything what is my excuse our Pastor said is what's required [Music] [Music] and surrender

myself how many times has God already spoken to us and he speaks to us again and he speaks to us again and we have not responded [Music] did you know don't you notice that God didn't give much information to Samuel respond until Sam and so Samuel responded to speak to us but we have to have a response I am hearing you Lord I know that it is it is not my imagination it is not the preacher it is but it is you Lord that is speaking to me when you take note when you notice that okay I see those that it has been God's use that it is God it is God knocking himself it's not the preacher but it is putting the words in the preacher's mouth but it is God guiding himself into our life it is not for your neighbors how rebellious we are he speaks to us he speaks to us and he speaks to us it is God Brothers it is God speaking to our life amen it is time for us to respond it is up to us to respond to Let's respond let's respond to him we're going to be dismissed we thank God for the word and
