[38:13] they still went on and talked that
[38:16] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[38:18] and Horses of fire and parted them both
[38:19] asunder and Elijah were not by a
[38:21] whirlwind into heaven
[38:23] is
[38:32] the Prophet Elijah
[38:44] [Music]
[39:24] he was captured
[39:32] served Elijah six to ten years
[39:37] he learned
[39:39] he was prepared
[39:42] he was formed
[39:46] he learned many things he had to learn
[39:50] before being anointed
[39:54] many times we read and win things
[39:57] happen quickly but
[40:00] there's always
[40:05] to prepare his children
[40:13] and Elisha was serving Elijah foreign
[41:08] foreign
[41:19] foreign
[43:01] and those
[43:03] and he folds it into
[43:06] he smites the water yeah and the Jordan
[43:10] was divided
[43:12] he does an incredible Miracle
[43:16] violating or defying the laws of gravity
[43:21] he makes the waters parts
[43:25] and be suspended
[43:32] walk on dry ground
[43:35] and once they walk through
[43:40] God's word says there were children of
[43:42] the Prophet
[43:43] that we're watching from
[43:46] what was happening
[43:52] how a very surprising
[43:55] was made
[44:00] by God's hand glorious
[44:03] to the name of God Gloria the Lord of
[44:06] God
[44:07] we are instruments
[44:09] in God's hands
[44:11] so God can be glorified
[44:15] a man amen
[44:19] um
[44:29] the other side of Jordan
[44:32] the Bible says that Elijah
[44:35] told Elijah
[44:38] what do you want me to do for you
[44:41] God is asking us what do you want me to
[44:44] do for you
[44:45] what do you want me to do for you
[44:48] what else do you need Church to believe
[44:55] what else do we need
[44:59] do you need a miracle God is willing to
[45:02] make a miracle says
[45:04] ask God for strength amen amen
[45:09] ask God for healing
[45:13] ask God for that nevertheless
[46:29] it's God
[47:30] the Elijah
[47:58] Oh Glory foreign
[48:53] Blanco
[49:25] and that's where we miss the target
[49:27] sometimes
[49:29] and sadly that's why we don't receive
[49:31] many times
[49:34] as many times we ask but God knows our
[49:36] hearts
[49:38] he knows what's inside our hearts
[49:45] that it's not for his glory
[49:48] for people to give us a pat on the back
[49:54] that's not what God wants
[49:59] he was humble in his heart
[50:09] that is pride
[50:13] from that spirit says
[50:17] in First Peter 5 5. likewise
[50:25] simple
[50:43] and we will see God's glory
[50:46] hello Google
[50:54] that's why he was cast out from Heaven
[50:59] Ezekiel 28 17 says
[51:09] a reason of thy brightness
[51:39] and I will bring these to ashes upon
[51:42] them
[51:43] in the sight of them that behold
[52:09] God gives us the more humble we should
[52:12] be
[52:22] and I say this for God's glory
[52:27] or Pastor
[52:31] he's always helping and stretching us
[52:35] gives us an opportunity to preach the
[52:37] word
[52:39] he doesn't ask for a PhD
[52:42] he asked us so we can strive
[52:46] and I was thinking
[52:49] if I would be in a different place I
[52:52] would be sitting
[52:54] I would be without opportunities
[53:07] God bless you pastors thank you
[53:11] let's watch out for pride
[53:14] okay
[53:19] okay
[53:20] I'm gonna be closing now
[53:23] I like to read a quote from brother
[53:25] Brandon
[53:28] I was reading this message today and I
[53:31] enjoyed this
[53:35] says a cruelty of sin and the penalty
[53:37] that it costs to Rich Sin from our lives
[53:43] are you willing tonight
[53:47] to die unto yourself
[53:50] he's speaking about pride is
[53:55] are you willing to die out to all
[53:58] thoughts of yourself
[54:00] just slay on the rock
[54:02] with your lamb there is
[54:14] when I think of men and women
[54:17] who think of Pride
[54:20] young men and women
[54:22] will give their lives
[54:25] over two things
[54:30] no one is exempt here here
[54:35] everyone is included
[54:37] and Men of age
[54:41] thinking of their job
[54:43] and of their neighborhood
[54:45] or something like that
[54:48] oh why don't you cry
[54:51] tonight
[54:59] Yonder on the cross with him
[55:02] let's die to our pride
[55:06] let's die to our arrogance
[55:09] it draws us far from God
[55:12] and be humble with him
[55:14] desire him with all of our hearts
[55:20] of his presence of his grace
[55:26] not to be greater than um
[55:29] only to glorify God
[55:35] our Lord Jesus Christ
[55:38] a god of Miracles
[55:45] of salvation
[55:48] testimonial that our testimony
[55:51] sound
[55:54] and be taken to the people that need it
[55:57] that need to see a change glorious glory
[56:01] to the Lord
[56:03] let's take up Elisha's example
[56:10] he did not want the double portion to be
[56:12] greater
[56:23] so
[56:26] do his will
[56:28] regulations so glorify the name of the
[56:32] Lord
[56:33] and that's why God granted him
[56:36] because he saw humbleness
[56:40] because he saw sincerely
[56:47] we cannot deceive God
[56:55] but not God
[56:59] God bless you and thank you
[57:02] [Applause]
[57:10] God bless you Elizabeth if you just uh
[57:15] open your Bibles
[57:16] I just want to read uh one scripture
[57:19] once again
[57:22] uh it's Second Kings 2 uh verse 14.
[57:30] and uh we'll just uh we'll just start
[57:32] off with Brother John Redd I just want
[57:34] to read it once again
[57:38] and it says like this
[57:41] second Kings 214
[57:45] it says and he took the mentor of Elijah
[57:48] that fell from him and smote the waters
[57:51] and said where is the Lord God of Elijah
[57:54] is
[57:56] Edo
[58:00] donde
[58:01] El Dios de Elias
[58:04] and uh you know when uh I think it was
[58:08] brother Alex that said it when he
[58:09] preached Alex
[58:12] he said that our brother uh when he said
[58:15] that Elijah was in the cave
[58:17] Elias you know and he thought he was the
[58:20] only one left
[58:22] thought he was the only one that had uh
[58:24] that that believed that the gospel
[58:30] you know in in the god in the God that
[58:33] he serves
[58:35] you know and uh he I remember him saying
[58:39] that he was sad that he was depressed
[58:44] because you know he didn't have anything
[58:46] in anybody to uh to deposit what he had
[58:52] what he had in him amen
[58:54] and you know but you know that he heard
[58:57] that still Small Voice
[59:00] and uh you know and and he called him
[59:03] out of the cave
[59:05] you know he said there was seven
[59:07] thousand more yeah
[59:14] amen amen as you know and he begins his
[59:16] journey
[59:18] because when Elijah had
[59:21] to be deposited somewhere
[59:25] you see he he wasn't selfish
[59:28] as a matter of fact
[59:31] oh you know what what he had
[59:34] and uh what he had he it wasn't gonna do
[59:37] him no good when he where he was going
[59:41] amen amen he begins his journey
[59:45] and you know and he sees Elijah
[59:49] elishao and you know the the thing of it
[59:52] is
[59:54] I think what God I believe what God
[59:56] Elijah's attention
[59:59] was that Elisha was playing with the
[1:00:02] team of us
[1:01:04] and you know that's why we don't yoke up
[1:01:06] Believers with unbelievers amen
[1:01:09] and you go there I'll be because you
[1:01:12] know they're not in the same steps
[1:01:15] and you know God wants us to be in
[1:01:18] rhythmos he wants us to be in sync
[1:01:23] because you know sometimes you know
[1:01:25] what's holding you back
[1:01:27] and you know it's the person that you're
[1:01:29] hanging around
[1:01:32] they're not they're not with you oh you
[1:01:35] know you're pulling forward
[1:01:37] and they're dragging you back
[1:01:41] God doesn't want that he has no quieres
[1:01:43] but Elijah
[1:01:46] he sees the life
[1:01:48] and you know Elijah wasn't a poor man
[1:01:52] his man what he is his father was a man
[1:01:55] of world
[1:01:57] so he was he was actually about his
[1:02:00] father's business
[1:02:04] believe that's what God Elijah's eyes
[1:02:07] he's like I like this guy because
[1:02:11] he's got potential you see I believe he
[1:02:14] was looking for a man
[1:02:17] of the same caliber
[1:02:19] as him
[1:02:22] somebody that felt a burden
[1:02:25] somebody that knew what it was like to
[1:02:27] pull
[1:02:30] somebody that wasn't just gonna sit back
[1:02:35] and relax but he knew what it was like

[1:02:46] father's business
[1:02:50] you know the the son of of a wealthy man
[1:02:54] you know he could have kick back

[1:05:59] this is a good place for you
[1:06:02] but Elijah foreign
[1:07:04] foreign
[1:09:00] until you respond
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:55] and things take place
[1:09:57] because the two just comes together
[1:10:01] Mercury
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:27] foreign
[1:12:49] forgot to park the waters
[1:12:51] that he would just open them up
[1:12:55] you would just reveal to us
[1:12:58] oh what it is that he wants us to do
[1:13:03] and he would just open that we would
[1:13:05] just open up our hearts
[1:13:15] what is exactly we're needing
[1:13:19] amen amen
[1:13:21] Eliseo
[1:13:25] sees Elijah Department
[1:13:30] we see a perfect type
[1:13:33] of Moses and Joshua
[1:13:36] Josue amen amen they said you know Moses
[1:13:41] opened the waters
[1:13:43] and then you know on the comeback
[1:13:46] you know we see Jordan we see Joshua
[1:13:49] open the waters
[1:13:53] he does the same things
[1:13:58] God vindicating
[1:14:00] you know that this was the man
[1:14:03] this was the man that that that was
[1:14:06] gonna leave the people okay
[1:14:09] amen amen so when we sit there and and
[1:14:13] you know have you ever went to I'm
[1:14:14] talking about deposit now all right and
[1:14:16] we are said we have a lot of the
[1:14:18] depository you know because that's what
[1:14:20] that's what Elisha was after all right
[1:14:25] he wanted he wanted you know that that
[1:14:28] deposit
[1:14:37] you know have you ever gone to the store
[1:14:42] and uh you know you think you got money
[1:14:44] in the bank
[1:14:45] you know and it's just it's just easy
[1:14:48] for you to just you know swipe together
[1:14:53] yo you got about four or five people
[1:14:55] behind you
[1:14:57] you know you should just swipe use
[1:15:03] declined it is
[1:15:09] it's kind of it's embarrassing yes
[1:15:12] pretty shameful
[1:15:14] man they think I'm broke
[1:15:22] another
[1:15:43] there was never a deposit
[1:15:46] they never
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:45] that's the first thing he does foreign
[1:17:51] I want you to notice uh the first
[1:17:53] miracle that he does after opening the
[1:17:55] waters
[1:18:03] is that he goes to Jericho
[1:18:07] and he brings healing
[1:18:11] you know I believe we believe a message
[1:18:13] in this day okay
[1:18:16] it was the first pool
[1:18:21] Elijah goes to Jericho
[1:18:26] and he takes healing to the water
[1:18:30] amen amen
[1:19:12] there can't be any fruits have you ever
[1:19:16] drank bitter waters
[1:19:20] you know it
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:56] I want you to understand what what he
[1:19:58] what he uses
[1:20:03] he uses Elisha uses salt Eliseo USA Sal
[1:20:09] to heal the waters
[1:20:13] amen amen
[1:20:16] you know salt is good
[1:20:19] the soul has influence
[1:20:22] amen amen
[1:20:24] Tierra
[1:20:31] we should have that influence
[1:20:33] you know wherever we are
[1:20:36] wherever we go
[1:20:38] oh we should have an influence
[1:20:43] and you know there's a lot of people
[1:20:45] oh they're not receptive
[1:20:49] you know perhaps to to your
[1:20:52] persona you know and the reason is
[1:20:54] because when you add salt to an open
[1:20:57] wound okay
[1:21:01] you know it brings the irritation
[1:21:05] it burns
[1:21:07] you know and I believe that you know
[1:21:09] when you bring that salt
[1:21:11] and you know you pour it on people that
[1:21:14] are wounded you said
[1:21:16] they will just let God
[1:21:19] let's just continue to work
[1:21:22] it would bring healing to the people
[1:21:26] you see it would bring healing to their
[1:21:28] lives and
[1:21:31] amen amen
[1:21:33] you see one of these things
[1:21:36] you know that that that that that that
[1:21:37] happened here
[1:21:39] was that Elisha
[1:21:42] you know making sure I said
[1:21:46] that that deposit okay
[1:21:49] was there estaba there was a
[1:21:53] confirmation from God
[1:21:56] that he was with Elijah
[1:21:59] and you know there was a lot of people
[1:22:04] Elijah in their time
[1:22:07] but they didn't see him exactly
[1:22:10] all the way Elijah song
[1:22:19] I believe that there's a lot of people
[1:22:21] in our time
[1:22:24] they won't exactly see brother Branham
[1:22:29] exactly the way you see him
[1:22:32] you see he was a true
[1:22:34] propheta he was a prophet of God
[1:22:38] authenticated by the word himself
[1:22:41] you see the thing of it is
[1:22:44] it have you caught that revelation
[1:23:13] for the last time
[1:23:18] that they didn't exactly see him
[1:23:21] they didn't see him to leave like Elisha
[1:23:25] Dido
[1:23:29] is
[1:23:33] and there's a lot of people oh they
[1:23:36] won't see
[1:23:38] they won't see this message
[1:23:41] oh exactly the way you see it
[1:23:44] because they couldn't accept the man
[1:23:49] but Jesus said
[1:23:51] if you don't believe me
[1:23:54] oh believe the works
[1:23:56] you see it and that's why they don't
[1:23:59] catch it foreign
[1:24:35] that's his desire tonight
