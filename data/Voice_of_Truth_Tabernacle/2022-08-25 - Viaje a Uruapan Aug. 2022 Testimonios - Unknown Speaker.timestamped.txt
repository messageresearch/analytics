[30:20] come
[30:55] [Applause]
[31:43] something that's worth it
[32:25] have you ever asked yourself that
[32:47] it's because jesus saw this man's
[32:48] potential
[32:50] if he left it all
[32:52] [Music]
[32:54] and how
[33:08] because we aren't
[33:36] um
[33:50] hope

[34:31] you don't know how much it means to them
[35:04] [Applause]
[35:40] as our pastor said
[35:42] significant
[35:56] the way they

[36:20] even though they haven't met us yet um
[36:24] they have
[36:52] brother
[38:00] we also had the opportunity to meet
[38:01] sister elia's family

[38:24] that i send him a greeting
[38:29] brother sends you a lot of greetings
[38:33] for every one of you amen amen um
[38:42] i also learned a lot on this trip la
[38:44] cultura
[38:47] mexican culture is a lot different from
[38:49] here um
[38:54] how it looks for the roads the houses
[38:57] but also the people
[39:02] here people are more shy over there
[39:09] people have love for you even though
[39:10] they haven't met you um vienen como silo
[39:28] [Music]
[39:37] we were on a class for brother edgar's
[39:39] sons
[39:54] because it was
[40:36] also had family relatives
[40:41] there's another branch of our church out
[40:42] there

[42:04] served us with all their with a lot of
[42:06] love
[42:09] we noticed it in the food
[42:12] it's the
[42:23] [Music]
[42:30] different than going to a youth camp
[42:33] or some special services
[42:39] a special service or a youth camp
[43:08] i was sharing with the brothers from
[43:10] over there okay
[43:24] in the beginning
[43:40] i felt as though i was still in fort

[43:51] he
[44:07] he
[44:09] i must switch to english okay
[44:12] um
[44:13] i think this trip really changed me
[44:19] because i had to go out of my comfort
[44:20] zone
[44:23] i had to
[44:24] not only meet new people but
[44:28] talk to them in a language that i'm not
[44:30] very strongly
[44:33] encouraged
[44:39] aside from all that apart
[44:42] i felt at home you're missing t in casa
[44:46] and
[44:47] i miss a lot the brothers the sisters
[44:54] um
[44:55] the youth is

[46:36] bueno starting casa de nuevo um we
[46:39] missed every single one of you guys
[46:49] um it was my first missionary trip with
[46:52] uh my dad and my brother diego
[46:58] and just a first missionary trip out of
[47:01] the united states
[47:04] and uh yeah i just want to give thanks
[47:06] as well to my pastor
[47:22] and just really see that the love for
[47:24] the people
[47:27] had already seen it
[47:29] but now being next to his side
[47:33] i just seen the sorry brothers
[47:55] and just seeing how privileged we really
[47:57] are
[48:02] to have a pastor
[48:04] by
[48:29] and you know um
[48:31] yeah it was just a big privilege to go
[48:33] on this trip
[48:36] um
[48:37] like our sister mariana said
[48:41] how do you recommend it
[48:45] not just to the youth but to anyone else
[48:52] they're amazing brothers
[48:55] and
[48:56] um i remember something that our brother
[48:59] ergot said over there
[49:06] we're doing a circle and we're kind of
[49:08] just getting to know everyone
[49:12] and this really touched me yes
[49:23] you know we're just in the freezer
[49:24] frozen
[49:42] and just how you know we preached on
[49:45] friday meet diego and
[49:47] my brother isaac here
[49:52] just how people come to you
[49:56] tell you that man that preacher really
[49:58] helped me
[50:02] you don't know what i was going through
[50:06] when people two times the age of of
[50:09] eighteen cuando alguien que
[50:39] and you know these preachings that we
[50:40] had over there
[50:44] it wasn't just to our brothers over
[50:45] there
[50:47] yeah they really touched me as well
[50:51] you know i didn't realize the potential
[50:53] i had in me
[50:56] to be able to go on these trips
[51:00] and touch these brothers
[51:03] um
[51:04] and you know i just remember our brother
[51:07] eric and my dad preaching about record
[51:12] you know materials that were made out of
[51:14] london
[51:17] that was saturday night
[51:20] friday we preached about the trust in
[51:22] the process
[51:27] and then our brother titus finished it
[51:28] off
[51:30] but yeah
[51:32] you know i would just recommend it your
[51:34] recommendation
[52:05] just everything all the food was pretty
[52:07] good
[52:09] but that's not what the main point is
[52:12] main point is to go touch at least one
[52:14] soul
[52:16] principle
[52:38] and i really like something that my
[52:40] brother diego said
[52:44] he said groundbreaking
[52:52] and you know because
[52:54] we're breaking ground over there to try
[52:55] to plant a seed
[53:15] but yeah god bless you brothers
[53:18] [Applause]
[53:26] yes
[53:40] it was a very special
[53:56] it was something special that god
[53:57] allowed me to have a one-on-one with all
[53:59] the sisters
[54:06] and god allowed me to feel for the
[54:08] people on this trip
[54:11] there wasn't anyone there
[54:17] um
[54:20] i was able to identify with everyone
[54:22] there
[54:23] los ninos from the children
[54:32] and also to the most uh older people
[54:36] um
[54:50] when i was a young girl in mexico
[54:54] the needs out there
[54:56] um
[55:03] they've all been hurt at some point in
[55:04] our lives
[55:07] we don't want to come to church
[55:11] we only need someone to give us that
[55:13] push is
[55:20] when brother isaac was saying of the
[55:21] circle we did to get to know each other
[55:25] i shared with the brethren
[55:30] one of the reasons i was there in a
[56:12] i also struggle socializing with new
[56:14] people
[56:29] my cousins
[56:33] they are an extension from us
[56:39] i was able to see how god moves and
[56:41] simplicity
[56:45] the more simple you become the more god
[56:47] can use you yes
[56:53] petitions being answered of people
[56:56] espana
[57:02] and i was very happy to be part of that
[57:05] um
[57:25] marianna's and sister eileen

[1:18:24] i
[1:18:25] i know that it is important
[1:18:28] the job that we do of live streaming all
[1:18:30] the services
[1:18:36] but i wanted to actually see it
[1:18:43] and persona and
[1:18:46] i was a little troubled with well i have
[1:18:48] to save a lot right now
[1:18:53] and it cost way more than last time
[1:18:59] but it didn't matter and i knew that
[1:19:02] i just didn't even think about it and i
[1:19:04] bought the tickets and everything no
[1:19:05] importoni la pence
[1:19:12] god was going to provide or something
[1:19:16] the week before a few days leading up to
[1:19:19] it
[1:19:22] god provided me with the small rays
[1:19:29] an extra
[1:19:30] income from another thing i did
[1:19:36] that covered almost all of the costs
[1:19:42] and i knew that that was god
[1:19:47] i had the
[1:19:48] in my mind too i wanted the expectation
[1:19:51] to change my mentality okay
[1:19:55] mentality
[1:19:56] of
[1:19:57] um to just see how important it is um
[1:20:00] what we do here
[1:20:04] and since arriving there and how they
[1:20:07] received us
[1:20:10] it's like i already knew them and they
[1:20:13] already knew me
[1:20:16] alone
[1:20:18] it was
[1:20:19] like the same people the same love from
[1:20:22] here
[1:20:27] many people asked me if
[1:20:29] i felt homesick muchas personas

[1:20:44] see all of that and foreign
[1:20:48] and get to know the brothers and sisters
[1:20:54] including the youth
[1:20:57] i was a little nervous
[1:21:00] and i would tell isaac a lot
[1:21:04] that i don't know what i'm going to do
[1:21:06] because i don't speak spanish that well
[1:21:09] no come on come on
[1:21:13] but i said i'll just pray that god will
[1:21:15] give me all the right words

[1:21:24] felt great and
[1:21:25] my spanish was fine

[1:21:35] really connect with some youth there

[1:21:43] just seeing
[1:21:44] our brother tito our pastor
[1:21:50] and how privileged i am and we are okay
[1:21:54] somos aqui nosotros specifically as a
[1:21:56] youth a specifically common hoveness

[1:22:09] to
[1:22:12] how
