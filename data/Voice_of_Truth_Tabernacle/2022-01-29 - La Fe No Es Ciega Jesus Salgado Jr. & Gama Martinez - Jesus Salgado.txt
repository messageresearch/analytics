this night how great thou art how many believe it [Music] my soul [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] yes [Music] [Music] genesis chapter 22 how genesis and and it says like this and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here i am one more time please and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here i am and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do anything unto him for for now i know that do do fear is god seeing who has now with you thy son thy only son from me amen may god bless his word i to be making a small prayer quest lord we are here tonight expecting something from you we are here looking for your blessings lord estamos we know that you have great blessings for us every day may you help us lord are you may you help us take something from tonight may you help us get leave rejoiced by your word i asked all this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you could take your sea brothers uh i'll be speaking of abraham and the faith that abraham had you know abraham did not take a um a very easy way because he took god's way and god's way is not always easy god's way is not easy but it's the right way that he would give him a son and abraham waited a very long time abraham waited years of waiting and once the promise came to abraham god came to abraham and tell and told him to sacrifice his son what he loved the most imagine him uh carrying his son and now having to sacrifice his son that had to be something very hard for abraham abraham loved the obedience abraham knew that he abraham loved god more abrams and there was a blessing for the obedience god was testing abraham lost it is that he knew that he feared god and sometimes god wants to to see if we believe in him sometimes we believe in him only in good times [Music] we all have something to sacrifice it can be our time it could be our job it could be anything but there's something that we have to sacrifice and we all know what we have to let go of it you know some of us like to watch a lot of you know uh sports games and maybe that's what's taking our time that's when god brings his blessings asking us to figure it out a little bit in here abraham believed in god abraham believed in the promise that god gave him abram and it says that he was blessed it is it's for god's blessings [Music] god wants us to push a little bit more god wants us to put a little bit more effort a little bit more in him that is what god wants brother yes a location yes i believe that no one in the bible took an easy way that everyone chose god's way everyone chose the right way [Music] there's things we have to sacrifice a lot of the things bother us from getting closer to god and sometimes we don't understand what's happening we only see to a certain point and maybe the only thing you have to sacrifice is just one thing maybe that one thing is what's bothering you i'm getting closer to god god is helping you with that leaving you alone he will never leave us alone he's promised us that he wouldn't leave us alone and until this day we haven't been alone brothers yes because we all want to see our god remember but your true friend is always going to be there amen come on now i would like to read mark 11 mark mark 9 9 23. and jesus said unto him if lucas believe all things are possible to him that believeth in [Music] all things [Music] may god bless [Applause] god bless i want to thank the pastor and god for the opportunity that is given to me today since my pastor put me on the list to preach something to you um i've just simply been a little nervous and if you come with an illness or something in your heart the lord led me to the book of revelations to start the subject here and the subject god gave me is the faith isn't blind if you could accompany me to a revelation chapter 3 verse 1. when you have it you could say amen this is and unto the angel the church and sardis write these things said he that had the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou has the name that thou livest and are dead truly brothers the lord gave me this sardis significa escapada means uh the escape entonces we're seeing that that age estab establandos is speaking on the escape of martin luther hermanos just follow me i'm going to join it with abrams the lord gave it to me in this manner martin luther so martin luther established he nailed the 95 theses at the door of the catholic church [Music] brothers why did lord the lord give this to me because there's a faith brothers and if you accompany me to a genesis chapter 22 verse 1 when you have it you could say amen and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him i will tell you verse 3. and abraham rose up early in the morning [Music] and settled his ass then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place of far off and abraham said to his young men blind because look brothers we should know what we are founded upon we should know what we are believing in foreign god did many [Music] he authorized it you know i i'll accept it later last year i went to a gathering of the youth the leader was trying to was trying to help the youth with with our foundation what where where we believe in anton says [Music] is [Music] of our beliefs and as i said before we're not worshiping a man okay that man was born by the spirit of god spiritually by the he's a very powerful man and he's a millionaire [Music] is so what's the problem huh pastor i shared with my pastor my heart is is grieved what are the parents doing what are the parents because the parents come abraham abraham taught isaac who god was he's sagging senor isaac taught jake who god was huh ivan yeah adam and eve lincoln [Music] in the bible is [Music] hear a the but if we see [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] youth media they found me out there in the street and
