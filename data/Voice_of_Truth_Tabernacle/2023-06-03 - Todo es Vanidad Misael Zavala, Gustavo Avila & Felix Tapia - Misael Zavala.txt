[Music] [Music] as [Music] child foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] to the book of First Kings chapter 11 1 verse verse 1 through 4. thanks to God for the opportunity California our brothers from California internet and all of those who watches via the Internet the word of God says like this but King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh woman of the moabites ammonites adamites zidonians and Hittites verse two of the Nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel ye shall not go into them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods Solomon claim unto these in love is 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines and his wives turned away it came to pass when Solomon was owed that his wives turn away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David with his father you may be seated vanity under the sun a chosen King by God a son of according to the heart of God as they have preached to us already Solomon had a dream would give him a gift of wisdom now we know that the gifts are for the people and it's not for those who operates that blinded Solomon a little because he took advantage of that gift he started well he started to Reign good dios God Vindicated him God Vindicated what he dreamed and the god of wisdom God manifested through him God manifested in a man amen a legitimate gift of God foreign persuade him we can see in First Kings chapter 2 21 and 22 speaking on the Chiba they say and she said and I be given unto Niger thy brother to wife the king of Solomon answer and said unto his mother and why does thou ask Abhishek and Shino Knight for adonijah as for him the kingdom also for he is my elder brother even for him and for abaithar the priest and for joab the son of zeroyah is and King Solomon swore before God for God saying do me as God even unto me be added amen because he gathered riches for himself in reality all of Israel was rich because there was Prosperity but there was some laws and we'll see later on for the Kings of Israel says I got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house also I had great possessions of Great and Small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me is I gather me also silver and gold and the peculiar Treasure of kings and all the provinces I got me men singers and women singers and the Delights of Sons of men as musical instruments and and that all and all all of that sorts so I was great and increased more than all that were before me Jerusalem also and my wisdom remained with me so we see that Solomon starts to fall in verse eight he said the Delights of the sons of men he says he has as a musical instruments maybe with Pagan downtown going to downtown when I got over here the center the downtown hasn't gotten any better they say verse 9 says also my wisdom remained with me we see that although he began to fall God did not take that gift away the guests continue to operate so what does that means that even if you have the best gift in church be a preacher musical or a musician salvation the gift doesn't guarantee you salvation that's right doesn't guarantee you being with God it doesn't mean that God is backing you up because the gift is not for you [Music] hola so we see that God had a sequence he reigned he didn't take the kingdom away 40 years and the word of God says giving his heart to the world 40 years until he died God didn't take him away from the scene but he had a purpose I had a purpose I like to read some Commandments for the Kings as read in Deuteronomy in Israel before there was a king in Israel because God knew that they were going to ask for a king and God knew that they would derail or adios but God you can't hide anything God knows everything everything that you do everything that you think God already knew it he's in the presence foreign to the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee and shall possess it and shall dwell therein and shall say I will say they came over me like as all of the Nations that were that are about me whom the Lord thy God shall choose one from among thy Brethren shall thou said as king over there thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother and the sixth thing is for the king is but but he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply horses for as much as the Lord has said unto you ye shall henceforth return no more that way neither shall you multiply wives to himself that his heart turned not away neither have he greatly multiplied to himself silver and gold not just have many women these are riches for himself in abundance this had a purpose maybe if he would have had 700 wives Israelites the scene would have changed a little well Mundo but he started to mix with the world when you start to mix yourself with the world that doesn't mean you can't have a friendship sick aura foreign [Music] David represented Christ do you believe that the Congress says amen Christ is going to sit in Israel yesterday and it's David a man after God's Own Hearts had 500 wives see what I mean David with his 500 wives Solomon with his thousands the son of David in the natural representation which represents Jesus Christ the son of David in the spiritual okay yeah this is going to be spiritual created life created why Ben is that's the way it was in the beginning but not not now the life we live now don't let that escape you accepted accept it in your hearts but neither of those women could have another husband he was of the original creation none of those women could have another husband but that husband could have a thousand wives thus saith the Lord that's the Bible now I went back took my time and show you about you under and what started and what Jesus said now do you see it clearly now that was a shadow and a figure the Lord Jesus Christ because the Lord Jesus Christ has a wife that's of all types of all Races Jonah chapter 2 verse 8. this is they that observe lime vanities forsake their own Mercy what is vanity it's an illusion the devil places it's only an illusion something that that something that already passed something that Fades away but nevertheless instead of an illusion stay with the word of God something that is something that remains something that will not never finish God bless you [Applause] this evening I was vanity under the sun is a subtitle Mento wisdom tied to understanding and we will be worried in the word in the Book of Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7. Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7. [Music] this evening I'd like to bring out so much a Sunday school teaching a lot on the Bibles [Music] the whole Bible amen God it says in the following way the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge let's pray now we come before your glorious presence that's allowed us to be in your place use your service but it's foreign your word through the Holy Spirit to each other every one of us needs this evening we give you thanks for everything to the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] everything is the first scripture I read here is the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge we know that our Prophet said it's a respective I want a place this is if there's something you can take this evening fear of God yes respect is respect and respect to God is love to God now this evening obviously we're talking about the characters he was a wise man and I'd like to bring the word for wisdom in Hebrew that it's called hokma they say is correct opportuno and this means it's the knowledge and the ability to make the right decisions at the opportune time yes and this evening if you notice I'm preaching in Spanish it's for my brothers [Music] wisdom is a knowledge and the ability to make the right choices to make the right choices [Music] to be able to take the right decisions [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and so the wisdom that I want you to get straightened out on here before we start is a wisdom of God Amen the wisdom of God is try to twist the words now I'm going to jump a little forward on this in order to accept Satan you've got to believe Satan he is and there's a part here that says that there is perverted that is perverted to a perverted cause [Music] don't you give thanks to God that not only not only does the prophet tell us what kind of wisdom there is also tells us how to distinguish one from the earth because he says and anything that would try to twist the word of God this isn't anything that would try to twist the word of God it is the incorrect Spirit as we know in the beginning it's the same as it is today the devil doesn't change his ways or he works the same way foreign we're gonna go through yes sir because the scriptures his Commandments because to understand God and see to know how he conducted his characteristics and the fear of God is to respect and to respect and just because of love can one go through that is and you can only obtain that wisdom through that way of that person foreign [Music] keep my Commandments and live and my law as the ability and I love this part is my sister and call understanding thy King's woman no in English it says but look at how it's saying to wisdom there are my sisters Solomon is saying have them along with you again yes we know that wisdom is the entire word of God but not just having the word of God you understand the word of God in your life that they may keep thee from the strange woman from The Stranger with flat Earth how he is saying is always going to try and make it easy to get a hold of the things that are outside of the word of God and he knows all the things that are going to attract [Music] and be held among the simple ones that discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding again if we can link that a word understanding to knowledge to knowledge and as our pastor has shown that knowledge is and I like to bring this as a Young Man void of understanding um he's going to present everything very easy at the age of 12. I'm opening up here and I had an attraction to them I knew that that attracted me and at a young age I remember that when we moved to California from California to Albuquerque not less than two weeks I already had a girlfriend and a week and a half afterwards I broke up with her and had another one it causes us to laugh right that's funny but the devil isn't playing games playing church if they allow themselves he knows that he if God can get a hold of them or if the devil at a young age he knows he knows how much he can do verse 9 says in the Twilight in the evening in the black and dark night is [Music] the devil likes to work in the dark places youth and at the end of the day solamentea Brothers he said do I want a reality to do I want an illusion that's really what it is all the vanities of this world it's your choice I'm here because of a choice because I want something real yeah [Music] we still want to return to that sometimes but I returned to this is foreign all that you need to overcome this world God bless you [Applause] God bless you can you guys hear me it's been a long time I took a little break but you know I'm back it feels good to be back can we give a round of applause thank God for this opportunity we're putting the trust in me and if I can put a little title to this message vanity will fail you uh if we can jump to First of Kings chapter 11 verse 11. wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for as much as as this is done of thee and Dallas has not kept my Covenant and my status in which I have commanded Thee I will surely rent Thee the Kingdom from thee and I will give it into thy servanti chapter 31 verse 8. and the Lord he is that they'll go before thee and he will be with thee and he will not fail the neither for safety fear not neither this mice intimidates I believe we're towards the end of Solomon right at this point you know God already had taken his kingdom and he was going to give it to his service you know he had all the wisdom he had everything he wanted and we read for for the first couple uh chapters of of first of kings and how is described on how that Palace was built describe you know I'm like whoa that that's a nice house you know that's something nice you know me with my one bedroom apartment I feel good but you know imagine him he had a little area that was by the beach you know it was nice he had everything you know I believe that he realized at that point that everything was just vanity everything that you have in this world it's not for you it's gonna stay here one day we will perish and it will be here you cannot take it with you it's gonna be here it's going to stay here that's where he realized wow I don't have nothing he didn't do nothing that what God had commanded you know he he went off to the world he had different types of things yeah he's he he went and married different type of of wives and he lost everything at the end I always ask the question I don't know if you ever asked yourself and uh sometimes let's be honestos sometimes I I feel like a failure I don't know who can relate with that let's be honest we all at one point in our life felt like a failure we felt like we couldn't do it anymore we felt like quitting we said there is no way for us we're gonna throw the towel I am a failure I don't know how God can make a relationship with me I am a failure and this being a youth service I was reading an article why sometimes young people sometimes feel like failure sometimes we try to fit in with certain groups and we don't fit in we feel like we're the outcasts that we're different that we don't fit in we say I'm not cool enough I don't fit in no no no no no I I am a failure my mind they try to do certain we try to do certain things sometimes and we don't get the results we take a test Ament we take a test and we don't get the results we want no no uh and we feel like a failure we said I am not going to be successful when you go on social media you start looking at other people's lives and how great they're living their life how they're going traveling around the world and you're just right here your sister and you're just sitting here and you're like I want to be like them I want to travel like them you know you start wanting to be like them all these these uh I don't know what you call them these things advocates for social media is all these influencers they make their life seem so happy like they're living in Paradise every day but that's just what they show you know deep inside they're probably hurting you know and that's what we want you know we want to go after those things sometimes that's what I that's what our heart wants is but all that at the end of the day all that stuff from the world it's gonna failure it's gonna break you hello it's going to destroy you are sweet it's gonna take you no place I've seen a picture once it showed a really nice house and they showed a very old broken-down house and I said one was rich [Music] and the bottoman had another picture and they had a picture of two grapes and that's that's what's going to be the end yes you know that's what the world is going to be this is looking that's where we're gonna end up we can have all the riches of this world but it's never going to take us nowhere that every human being has to fail this is and I'm going to read this quote trying to do trying to do God a service without being the will of God and I'm just going to paraphrase it I I can't let him do it I'll bring the man along and his son will rise the Everlasting House of God and
