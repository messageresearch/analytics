Thank you for your love that you have shown towards us towards those of us who also come from Colorado and it is simply beautiful to be able to have that. Amen Genesis chapter 12 we know the story of Abraham but let's read it verse one onwards is when God Calls Abraham says but Jehovah had told Abraham go from your land and from your kindred and from your father's house to the land that I will show you and then he gives the promises the blessing and says and I will make you a nation and I will bless you and magnify your name and you will be a blessing I will bless those who bless you and I will curse those who curse you and all the families of the earth what a promise what a promise God gives this man Abraham and his Seed and we are part of it We are the Seed or the spiritual offspring through faith the spiritual offspring of Abraham we are children of our father Abraham brothers Let's pray heavenly father to you We give thanks once again that you are in our midst that you have called us that you have saved us Lord and while we speak your word and and what you have put in our hearts for Uruapan Lord for this town here for those who They came to be present now, sir, that there is no person here who only came to have one more service. No sir, they have come with an expectation of what you want to talk to them personally about, it is not for the neighbor, although Sometimes we want to pass it on to the neighbor to the brother and we say this is not for me, this I only came to listen but if God has it here it is for a purpose and heavenly father that you can, Lord, speak to our hearts and tell us what we have to hear. We ask in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen you can take your places because we are in expectation we are in excitement of what God wants to speak to us now This morning I get excited I get up with excitement when I know I am going to speak to the children of God hallelujah I get up in expectation sometimes you want the service to start earlier right sometimes you wake him up at 5 in the morning and He says now we have to start the service because because one is filled with emotion from studying the word being in connection with God being in communication with God and that way I come to you to share a little of what I God has given us and put in our hearts Ah the the title of this message is going to be be blessed or are you blessed say I am blessed I am blessed d again as if you believe it I am blessed some are still doubting it Hopefully at the end at the end of the final day of the day at the end of this service realize how blessed you are and we are going to try to concentrate and give all our attention just for a few minutes because that is the way we receive more when our mind is focused and we are ready to listen and our mind is not troubled with other things and distractions so you do all the focus you can to listen to what God has for you because I do not believe that God sends us or brings us to this place Oh just to give one more sermon Just to preach a nice word to you, I don't believe that's why God brings us. I believe that if God brings us, it's specifically for you, specifically for those who are going to be listening. God has the word that you need. Listen Now we are blessed now we are going to speak a little bit about Abraham and the story of Abraham most of you know it is a very well known story and but but because we always have a multitude and of different levels and people who perhaps are just beginning in the things of the Lord I try not to get too deep and also try to explain things that maybe some of you don't know but those who do know her don't don't worry it's just something to refresh your memory now but I want to tell you some things that I've been noting while Abraham was studying Abraham we know him as the father of faith the one who began the one who began the people of Israel he is from him came out we know Isaac from Isaac we know that he came out to Jacob Jacob then his name was changed to Israel and and from Jacob and from and from Israel itself came the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 patriarchs, and from there comes the entire nation of Israel, yes, but if we go back a little in the history of Abraham we realize that he is a descendant of the sons of Noah and because he is a descendant of the sons of Noah we know that Ah that he has a history Abraham also has a past history and his past history is one of the survivors who went through the flood he comes from those who survived the flood there was a flood on the earth when it had never rained when it had never fallen to water from the sky God sent water from the sky and the Bible says that in the time of Noah when Ah he built an ark sin was so great it was It was so dark that God couldn't stand it anymore and he said I'm going to have to start over I'm going to have to cleanse the earth I'm going to have to wipe out all these people full of sin and I'm going to start over so he sent a flood he sent a flood that covered the entire Earth and only eight people were saved only Noah and his family Noah and his family were saved and of Noah's children we know that there were three sons and of them wine wine We can see that God bring Abraham now when one this is important because when one survives something I don't know if you have felt like a survivor some survive cancer some survive an accident some survive certain diseases that we are talking about physically but some of us are survivors of internal things of harder things of spiritual things spiritual of spiritual accidents of ugly things that have happened in our life and when and we can say by the grace of God we have been saved I think that the sons of Noah and Noah and his family could glorify God that God saved them and how many of us here can say by the grace of God I am still here Amen brother by the grace of God I am still here say it by the grace of God I am still here let me tell you we are survivors we are survivors we are we are those who have gone through the flood the Bible says some by the waters others by the fire Hallelujah but all by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we have survived attacks from Satan we have survived the [ __ ] trying to kill us in different ways just as the [ __ ] tried to kill the Seed of God throughout the entire Bible and tried of killing the children in the time of Moses and tried to kill the children in the time of Jesus so God has continued to try to persecute and kill the Seed of God but this morning I want to declare and say We are survivors Here we are still Here we are still something to thank God Glory to God Now Noah's family were the survivors and and and after we looked at the story of Noah and the flood the Bible a little earlier than what we read Before Genesis 12, the scripture that we read, we looked at an interesting story that God places between Noah and Abraham and it is the story of Nimrod. It is the story of a tower which is called the tower of Babel. And I don't believe that God put that story there. By coincidence, the story of the tower of Babel is that supposedly there was a man called Nimrod who began to build a tower so high that he wanted to reach heaven basically if we can summarize it that way. way he built a tower so high so big ah that even God had to interfere there even God had to say these these comrades are going fast these are They are tremendous they are reaching heaven basically and God had to interfere and change their language so that they can confused and that Tower was not finished but historians or those who study these things say that one of the reasons that Tower was built was not only to reach heaven but because Nimrodi and all the survivors were looking for a way to take care of themselves. That happened again in case the flood happened again in case God sent one more time to destroy the entire earth they were going to build a tower so that they would be protected so that no matter how high the flood went, how high it went the water they were going to be safe and they were not going to need an ark anymore They had their own way of escaping any flood any danger that could come to humanity within the story there in Genesis you can read it from Noah and then and Abraham In between those two stories we looked at the story of Nimr we looked at the story of people who had survived people who had survived On the other side of the flood On the other side of the danger and they were doing something that many of us do after we have survived a very strong attack that almost killed us, we began to think and build ways so that the same thing does not happen to us again. How many of you can identify a little bit with that? They say that someone who has survived something very strong often remains traumatized. s if they have survived if they have been saved and and and but but many times what they went through and what they went through left them traumatized to such a degree where they are making sure that it does not happen again Amen that for example that person does not hurt another person again time that what if that if they said something very ugly to him that they disgraced him they embarrassed him he starts to build certain walls certain barriers certain things around his life he starts to distance himself from certain people to make sure that it doesn't happen to him again because the pain was very great Yes because the trauma was very heavy and they still say that those who survived slavery those who have gone through slavery Especially the African Americans ooooo the Africans who went through so much slavery say those who study these things that even their DNA was changed, the trauma of what they went through from being slaves was so great that even their DNA was transformed and all those who can notice the difference between those who were slaves and those who were not slaves even though they were both Africans But those who were slaves, those whose ancestors were slaves, they see a difference even in their DNA because the trauma was so great that things in their body began to change to protect themselves from a similar trauma. In the future we can all identify with that and we can all say it is true there are traumas there are things so difficult so hard so heavy so painful that even remembering them one begins to breathe deeply I am one of the plots that God has had to work in me life has been with my mother And some of you know the true story that Ah I grew up in a broken home I did not grow up in a perfect home my dad Ah he He was a pastor and and the Apostolic Church and I grew up in the church but my mother was just a person who went to church because, well, they took her, right, and she had to do it, but over time there was something in her that began little by little to reveal itself, etcetera, to the point where Ah, as a child, I saw that when my father went out, other men entered the room. house at night later she began to have a relationship publicly with other men and she still took us with her and with the other man oh the other man he sometimes locked us in in in in in rooms when my father wanted to come for us and take us out of there take us and and I still remember being in a room where they had lacquered it and making sure that we didn't get out of there hearing my dad outside the door knocking and saying that he wanted his children hit by my mom strong traumas it got to the point where she left, abandoned us and I always felt rejected I always felt like it wasn't maybe not me even when I was already in the house I felt like maybe I wasn't her son in the way that I thought. It was about the way it hit me because of so many things that happened and that created a trauma inside me where you start to feel abandoned and you start to try to protect yourself. You don't want to feel rejection again so you walk away from me. People are serious, you don't try to make much connection with them, you start to feel that at any moment they can hurt you again at any moment. The pain can come back and you have to protect yourself, you have to look for a way to not get so close to people not to love them so much always be on the alert always be careful like someone who has suffered from hunger from great hunger like someone who such Once you went through a drought where you didn't have to eat for a long time and as soon as you have something you protect it and take care of it and you are always thinking about taking care of it and that there won't be enough and you have to make sure that you protect it. the little you have and you spend your time protecting yourself, thinking like a survivor, thinking with a scarcity mentality, thinking that at any moment you can be harmed, at any moment you can see hunger again in the world. earth at any moment things can get difficult and one has to protect oneself and many times we begin to have that mentality it is a mentality of slavery it is a mentality of someone who has survived of someone who is taking care of themselves who is trying to continue Surviving and thinks that at any moment something bad can happen, they identify a little with that, my brother, it was at that time after the tower when there were a lot of people who were protecting themselves so that they would not be harmed again, it was at that time that God He sends for Abraham. It was at that time I don't think it's a coincidence that God puts these two stories between Noah and Abraham and it was at that time where God tells Abraham he lived in in in in Babylon he lived in Ur of the Chaldeans Oh and he lived in where all this had taken place where the people had made the effort to survive and it was at that time where God Calls Abraham and says Abraham I need you to leave your land and Your family, leave your land I need you to let go of a comfortable place a stable place a place of protection a place where there was a great tower I need you to let go of that and I'm going to take you alone and I'm going to take you to a land you don't know what land it's going to be you no I'm not going to explain it to you I'm not going to tell you but I need you to get out of there and I want to tell you that I'm going to make you a blessed people Now I believe that What God was doing He was trying to transform Abraham's mind from a mind of scarcity to a mind of protecting himself to a mind of saying I don't have to try to protect myself there is someone watching out for me and I am more blessed than I think, brother, sir, I believe that if the children of God can reach the point where they realize how blessed they are, God can heal them from so much pain, God can heal them from so many traumas, God can free them from so many desires. that they have and they don't even realize why they have them That's right brother I'm starting to understand why For so long I wanted to be loved I wanted someone to take care of me it was because of the traumas I had gone through because I always felt like no one cared for me. I mattered no one took care of me no one was interested and always then you start looking for someone who loves you someone who is interested in someone and sometimes people don't know why they are looking for that that's right brother they say It's just that I just want someone who is interested in me I want someone to tell me how handsome I am because all my life I have been told that I am ugly people start looking for attention Yes we go to church they start looking for attention they start looking for things and they don't even realize why it is because They have gone through a great trauma in their life Many times and until God begins to change our mentality and until God begins to say son son no you are not lacking You are a blessed son You do not have to have a mind of scarcity you have You have to go around begging someone to pay attention to you. Let's go to church. You don't have to beg someone to pay attention to you. You don't have to take care of the little you have. I have made you my son and you are blessed. You won't need anything. I will be with you every day. of your life Lord I love it I love Psalm 103 and yesterday when our sister G was singing that that praise Oh my soul love your God eh eh it comes I believe it comes from Psalm Psalm 103 which says bless my soul the Lord and bless All my being, his holy name bless my soul Jehovah and do not forget any of his benefits He is the one who forgives all your iniquities so all your ailments are healed to the one who rescues your life from the Hole Hallelujah the one who crowns you with favors and mercies Oh Brothers If there is one thing I can do this morning, it is I want to remind you of what kind of God we have. I want to remind you of how blessed you have been. The [__] wanted to deceive us. The [__] wanted to say to him, Oh, poor thing, look at what has happened. Oh, poor thing. No one loves you, no one pays attention to you, a lie from Satan. We have a God who loves us in an amazing way , brother . so you don't need to shout something like that it feels even if it's not shouted But someone who knows what it's like to be forgiven when you hear those words There's something in your heart that just can't sit still knowing that our God has forgiven all our iniquities let me tell you with Just know that, son of God, daughter of God, just know that he has forgiven all of your all of your bad thoughts, all of your bad desires, all of your bad ways, every moment that you have denied him, every moment that you have not been completely faithful to him . You have forgiven each one of them just by knowing that we are a blessed people That's right brother That's right Hallelujah just by knowing that God who am I so that he looks at me Oh church who am I so that he looks at me I'm not going Let's talk about you I'm going to talk about myself for a moment Who is Tito Moreira so that God can put his eyes on me Who am I I am nothing or no one brothers we are dust of the earth I am dust of laer I am A sinner saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ I do not deserve anything I am nothing I am nobody Hallelujah but if one thing I know is that God has Blessed me because he has forgiven all my iniquities and on this and this morning Let me tell you I am not going to be one of those that does not testify the greatness of your God the Bible says yes if you fall the rocks will speak God said if you fall The Rock will speak there is not going to be a rock that is going to speak for me I am going to fail let me tell you there is not going to be a rock who is going to speak for you as a prayer Gloria Tito Morera is going to speak what he has done for me I am nothing I do not deserve anything however he has been my God he has kept me he has taken care of me he has helped me he has healed me he has never healed me Nothing has been missing. That is my God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Oh how easy we forget everything he has done for us. So easy we focus on our traumas and our pain and we don't focus on everything he has done for us. God has David had to remind his own soul I think you need to remind your own soul this morning you need to remind your soul remind him speak to his soul there is a soul í Amen and say to him bless my soul the Lord and bless all my be his holy name bless my soul Jehovah and do not forget any of his benefits Lord come on church I do not have to remind you of what God has done for you this is your soul you know you know you know what God has done for you Hallelujah Oh Brothers how bad we are Oh we are all sad everyone is silent because we are traumatized But let me tell you that God wants to transform that mind of scarcity and tell you you have much more than you think you have That's right we complain I say it for me brothers I am I'm preaching to myself Hallelujah we complain we despise we don't value what we have because we're traumatized Aha yes that's how it is because we're still thinking with a mind of scarcity a mind that there's not enough love there's not enough Sorry everyone is me everyone is me they criticize no they don't love us they don't love us like that I thought that's how I felt I felt rejected by anything anything made me feel rejected I was always taking care of myself and anything anything I felt like a rejection sometimes there are so many people who love us and We cannot look at him because we are still traumatized. Glory to God, that is brother, the truth continues to say here the scripture, he is the one who forgives all your iniquities, the one who heals all your ailments, the one who rescues your life from the Hole. Let me say, Oh, brothers, thank you my king with only this is what he says, he is the one who satisfies your mouth with goodness in such a way. Forgive me, oh sorry, he rescues your life from the Hole and that I should not preach so much. Not just by reading this psalm, I rejoice, the one who rescues your life from the Hole. Thank you, Father, crown of favors and mercies he who satisfies your mouth with good so that you are rejuvenated like the eagle Jehovah is the one who gives justice and right to all those who suffer violence his ways he notified Moses and the children of Israel of his works and says it merciful and Gracious Jehovah , slow to anger and abounding in mercy, will not contend forever nor will he keep anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our iniquities nor has he repaid us according to our sins and he says this because as the height of the heavens above the earth has increased His mercy on those who fear Him is speaking of you He is speaking of me this morning Oh brother let me tell you there I am I He has magnified His mercy as the height of the heavens Look how high the heavens are so great is the blessing of God for those who fear him amen brother is talking about the greatness of God's blessings I know that some of you still do not feel blessed because you look at your plots look at your mistakes look at what you have been missing let me tell you church the day you stop looking at what you have been missing and start looking at everything he has given you. You are not going to be looking for something somewhere else. You are going to look at the ground where you are stepping. Thank you Lord, you have blessed me. Look at your family around you. You are going to say thank you Lord you have blessed me you are going to look at this little church this building And you are going to say thank you Lord so much blessed we are plotted we are plotted true they hit us too hard but it is time to get out of there Amen it is time to get out of your traumas it is time to leave that behind It's time to leave that that mentality that way of thinking of protecting yourself of taking care of everything that oh no He's going to do something to me No sir I have a God who takes care of me I don't have to take care of myself I have a God who takes care of me Hallelujah God hallelujah That's right that's right God tells Abraham get out of that atmosphere get out of that way of thinking am, get out of that way of thinking as a survivor, you are not a survivor, you are a great nation and you will be a blessing to be so blessed Hallelujah God is going to be so blessed that he is going to be a blessing to all the others [Applause] That's right brother and that's how difficult it is to make a person leave a way of thinking of protection to a way of thinking of plenitude and blessing others. We hold on so tightly to things because we are traumatized because we are taking care of what we are taking care of. It's ours, you know why we don't give more, we're afraid, we don't give more because we're afraid, we're afraid, what's going to happen if I give it, we don't give more money. That's one of the things. Okay, don't be scared, no, I'm not going to talk about the money, but the money is one is one is public evidence of the rest that we do not give brothers we do not give more forgiveness to others we do not give love to we do not give more mercy to others because we are protecting ourselves because we have a mind of scarcity let him say brothers Oh Hallelujah I am blessed even if I don't have money brothers if you notice the story after God blessed Abraham after he told him this the words that we read says the Bible that there is a great famine on the Earth is that our blessing does not depend on the things that We look either at material things or at circumstances around us. I may not have money but what I have I give you said Juan gave what I have I give you Hallelujah I don't have silver or gold but I am blessed I don't have I don't have bank money but I am blessed Hallelujah I have forgiveness for my sins I have salvation you are great with I have healing for those who need it I have love for those who need it I have mercy for those who need it my blessing does not depend on what I have in my pocket brothers I give it because I I am a blessed person Hallelujah Lord, get us out of that mentality, get us out of those traumas Why do we go looking for love, attention and other things because we have been plotted someone Looks at us badly already already reminded us of the other that they did to us like that it is the truth we are traumatized people we are survivors but the way we have survived brought us there are people who escaped from the accident but were traumatized, they never want to go back to the accident in a car etc. and that's how we are. Many times get out of it, look, you need to look, you don't need to. more love you don't need more attention you don't need more understanding I have given you everything you need I will take care of you I will feed you I will be with you Abraham am The Bible says that he blessed us with every spiritual blessing says the Bible says Blessed be the God in Ephesians 1 3 Blessed be the God and Father Our Lord Jesus Christ who bless us yes Amen who blessed us am we are not going to be blessed Oh Brothers we are not going to be blessed we are not going to be no maybe he will bless us Oh you have to change your mindset he has blessed us with every spiritual blessing says the Bible blessed says he blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places eno we are blessed say I am blessed say I am blessed Oh say it until you believe it say it until you realize say it until who is beginning to realize how blessed he is Oh Hallelujah I wonder if Eve didn't realize how blessed she was when she heard the word of Satan she of life she didn't realize there was life for her she didn't realize that there was everything she needed and he [ __ ] sold something wrong because she thought she needed something but church you don't need anything You are so blessed you are so blessed you are not going to bless us you are not going to be blessed we hope to be blessed I don't know I don't know if they believe it I'm not sure I'm not sure if they believe it we're not going to be blessed You don't wait for the problems to be fixed so that you feel blessed You don't expect that to happen so you don't wait for the new car to arrive so that you feel blessed Do not wait for the church to be full so that you feel blessed Do not wait for the problems to go away for you to feel blessed the children of God have already been blessed by [Applause] God Hallelujah look God tells you in Matthew 5 we know we know this story Matthew 5 talks about the sermon on the mount is a very well-known story Ah the most well-known preaching of the Lord Jesus Christ the sermon on the mount and and we also call it the beatitudes Ah and where God begins to talk about the people who are blessed who are blessed blessed It means blessed and says in Matthew 5, when he saw the crowd went up to the mountain and sitting down his disciples came to him and opening his mouth he taught them saying Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven Blessed are those who mourn for they will receive consolation Blessed are the meek Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for Justice Blessed are the merciful Blessed are the pure in heart Blessed are the peacemakers Blessed are those who suffer persecution for justice's sake Blessed are you when you are reproached for my sake do not be persecuted now look and then it says rejoice and alleged because yours is great in the heavens but look god Jesus when he is saying this he is not saying you are going to be blessed he says you are blessed he says Blessed In other words you are blessed he says Ah the poor in spirit one says Well how how can say that Jesus Christ can say that the poor in spirit are Blessed and and and I don't want to take too long in this place but there is a lot to talk about in these scriptures but in summary when Jesus is telling him this he is talking to him to the poor in spirit he is speaking to people because he does not believe that they were the great religious and the Pharisees and the rich people and all the others who came to listen to Jesus were the simple people were the people who seemed to have nothing allelu was the people who seemed to be the excluded the strange the sinners the ones that no one else wanted and God comes He calls his people aaa his his his poor those who seemed to do nothing and tells them you are the ones who are blessed In other words even if you are poor in spirit You have been blessed Even if you cry You have been blessed even if you are meek You have been blessed blessed those who hunger and thirst for Justice the merciful those of pure heart says it blessed those who suffer persecution in others words I'm going to put it this way Even if you suffer persecution you are blessed anyway Hallelujah Oh brother Let me tell you Hallelujah this must reach our hearts am this must reach our hearts brothers because sometimes we think that because we are being persecuted we are not blessed Glory To God we don't feel blessed because everything is going wrong for us and Jesus came to change our mind yes Amen right thank you lord blessed you are father he came to change our mind because He looks at us all sometimes very sad he looks at us that we complain about everything look that We are finding errors in everything and this happened and they did this to me and they told me this and and and they treated me like this And why do they do this to me God says you poor in spirit you are blessed you who have been persecuted you who have been criticized you who have done things to you In any case, you are blessed. The blessing you have is greater than your pain. Oh Pio, you did not understand me, brothers. The blessing that God has given you is greater than the criticism. It is greater than the trauma. It is greater than what you have had. that passing the blessing that I have given you is greater is greater Amen Lord Oh Hallelujah brothers Yes we are going to go through persecution yes they are going to criticize us but in any case I am more blessed than that am Glory to God that's right brother I don't know I think They don't believe it. Yes, if they believed it, they would be the happiest people in the world. If you believed that, you would be the happiest person in the world. It's like a person who is so rich, so rich, so rich that a car breaks down or Something happens here someone is going to fix it somehow someone else is going to win there is no problem Amen brother Cos So It's some people who are so rich that they don't care about the things that happen Glory to God How about we are the children of God abah we are Hallelujah God has given us a message of rapture God has given us the faith of Abraham God has given us what can do the impossible every illness can go away any miracle can happen why are we so sad When we are blessed that's how it is brother but we don't believe it Oh Hallelujah church We are the most privileged people in the world leave your problems left the car Glory to God criticized you Glory to God they said something about you Glory to God that others do not want Glory to God I am blessed Hallelujah that this person does not support me this person does not support me Glory to God in any case I am happy [Applause] blessed Ah, my wife doesn't love me, my husband doesn't love me, don't pay attention to me anyway, I'm blessed. Oh, brothers, we need to heal from our traumas. Realize that the blessing is greater than the pain. to God be our traumas we need to say God How blessed I am I am your son you have forgiven me you have forgiven me Oh your mercy has been so great to me Oh Hallelujah her Oh I'm not going to hell I'm going to be with my lord the rest of eternity because What am I worrying about when my beloved is more than anyone?
