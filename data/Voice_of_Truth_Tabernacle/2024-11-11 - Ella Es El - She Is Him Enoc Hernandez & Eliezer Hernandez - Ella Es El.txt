fertile soil Lord and may this word find your redeemed bride may she hear the voice that your messenger has brought Lord that would come before the father I present it before you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you can open your Bible with me inis Genesis 24 verse 2 I want to take the story of Abraham sending his servant eleazer to find a bride for his son we're in the same subject going deeper with God you want to know how to get closer to him how how we can get to know him more how we can love God more than our capability or what is he expecting from every one of us it reads like this oh yeah no I started with the one myad Genesis 24:1 and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled all that he had put I pray thee that thy hand under thy my thigh [Music] and I will make the SW by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but thou shal go into my country and to my Kindred and take wife unto my son Isaac and the servant said unto him pre-venture the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from when thou camest and Abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then so let's jump to verse 58 and they called Rebecca and said to her Willl thou go with this man and she said I will go you may take your seats you think the musicians here we find a love story but it's not a very common story when you have time at your home please read Genesis 24 to yourself so you can understand all of this story I'm going to try to summarize it a little try to explain it a little and how this story applies to us in our time how it's so parallel so perfect there shouldn't be a doubt in us how it was simply a shadow now here we find that Abraham strick in an age he wants to find a bride for his son it wasn't an easy commandment to put in charge of any person he couldn't do it himself he had to entrust it to somebody of high trust and who better than that person that had control of all his possessions that had proven his faithfulness to him that he had not wasted one cent he had proved to him to be a worthy servant so he commands to this the steward of all his belongings to find a wife for his son now why did he not send just a son doesn't the son know his likes better than anyone else but watch this servant this servant had raised Isaac from a young age he seen him grow from the time he was born he knew him so well that he knew the same likes and dislikes of Isaac and Abraham knew this that's why he had this trust but beyond that Abraham wanted to express to his servant what was inside of Abraham's heart because us as parents sometimes we know that our children can make wrong decisions but the father knows more than the son and tells his servant please find a wife for my son and the servant says what if she doesn't want to come then Abraham tells him worry not the angel of the Lord will go before thee him trusting in the word of his master he begins this task and when he gets to the land of where Abraham is from he kneels to pray and he says Lord show me the bride that will be the wife of my beloved of my master and he asked one thing to he says Lord to the one that I ask water and not only give me water not just me but all of my camels let her be the one you have chosen look he got into prayer and before his prayer was over Rebecca was on her wayca was not the only damsel that came to get water from this well there were many damsels but she waited until the evening time and even elzer sent by the angel he went in the evening he didn't have to choose of many because he had prayed for her and he had not even finished his prayer here Rebecca comes and he simply says woman give me to drink and she being a damsel she did not deny it said yes I will give you to drink and I'll also give your 10 camels to drink and she began to give water to every one of these camels in the message decision a time to make a decision preached uh 1959 look how brother brandham sets this story now Isaac was a type of Christ through Isaac come Christ and then Rebecca was the type of the church did you C that the bride and elzer found Rebecca in the evening time the sign was performed in the evening time that's the time we're living in I trust that you get this it was in the evening time when Rebecca come out led by the spirit do you believe that how otherwise would she have come there might have been many before her but she was led by the spirit in the evening time and eler the messenger the minister the true servant to his master was in the evening time the true servant had left his Creeds in things and made up his mind that he was going to trust God in the evening time we can find in the scripture that the Lord Jesus Christ came to redeem a church he came to his own but his own reject him but unto all that received him gave them power to be made sons of God give them power to be his bride he came to redeem his bride but that wasn't in the evening time A Time had to go by Gentiles time is over the Lord Jesus Christ said then it will be the end in the evening time when the light is dimming out when the earth is in [Applause] darkness then time will be no more watch the times we live in it can't get darker than this Brethren speak with anybody and their mind is confused they don't know who they are themselves they wake up in the morning so worried we are in the evening time and God in a type promised to send a messenger in the evening in the seventh watch he promised to send an elzer to come gather and harvest that [Applause] Pride but she watch in this story the messenger comes and gives Rebecca the message and tells her back there where I come from my master the son of my Master he loves you hold on hold on she never thought he doesn't know me yet how can he love me just the same in our time it's been asked for this bride love him uncondition without seeing him by faith she beli by faith she received this message and as she heard the the more she heard about him he began to tell her everything my master has he will inherit and everything that will be his will be yours Oh it sounded sounded like a fairy tale but she trust in him because she had been led by the Holy Spirit she had also been in prayer and God knew the need in her heart why there was a deep calling another deep it's the same in our evening time breth God had to send a messenger there had to be one person to there had to be that heart willing to trust willing to love him without seeing him why is it so hard for people to see the Lord Jesus Christ if he's already shown all of his GI showed everything he wants for her one of the first things aler did to Adorn her and give her all the gifts that he had brought from his master brother brandham says that's why I believe those that are born again Holy Ghost F people is connected with God and are led by the spirit of God that's why they act so peculiar to the people they've made their decisions says they're going to go on out regardless if the rest they're going anyhow I love that don't care if this one walks or that I'm going to walk anyhow I don't care whether this one or what they say call me anything they want to I'm going anyhow why the life is in the blood and the life is in the the church the Christian that's born again by the spirit of God that's the spirit of Life blood relation to Christ that's what Abraham commanded El don't go find it with the can don't believe in the same God I do look for her from my homeland did you know Rebecca was cousin with Isaac they were blood relatives brother brandham says says that we our blood relatives through the sacrifice he did at the cross that's why we're relatives with him or Kinsman when God made the first he made him Spirit then he came to Earth formed him from the dust and put that spirit in man but when he forms a woman doesn't form her the same way first of all he forms her Earth brings her from the same material God formed man of the of the Earth from clay brings a ribs of and begins to form her and then from the spirit of Adam he pulls out the feminine and deposits in the woman watch the process of this first bride it's the same proc of the last bride of this end time this body that God formed Adam from The D of the Prophet calls it the body of the word but this body needed a to give her life this bride must first of all so that blood can be inside her then he begins to shape through the word and while he shapes her she's he's she's creating Faith virt patience Temperance patience godliness fear God brotherly love and when she's ready she's waiting for that to come and sit and rest upon her she can be ready to go home what brother Bram is saying here she must be of the same material brother never offend your wife she is your the church that gave his life for her she is part of him she is [Applause] him brother brandham says in the message in the evening messenger that's the messenger of the last days the evening light is first find that church where they will believe that message hunted can you read what I'm talking about hunt where that church is that will even let you come that won't close the door in your face and then when you do there you found character now she will stand still long enough to tell her how the bride's got to be dressed she's got to be clothed he what dresses the bride this message she begins to embrace the word of God brother message is nothing different from this Bible is the same thing in this but it had been promised that in the latter days all Revelation would be manifested to the bride to her the only one worthy of the son of his master this he says look at the little Rebecca listening to every word her little heart was beating don't you feel this way while the word is being spoken there's something where you identify when you identify there's nothing else to say but you identify with this word that's how our heart beats he was telling her until you I find the character then when I find the character then make her stand still long enough to get her ready to go meet him paragraph 249 notice even time the end his job will be to get the Saints ready the bride ready for the bridegroom that will be his message who prepares the bride the me messenger message now you want to learn ABC so you can study algebra later learn ABC first always believe Christ amen amen God bless [Applause] you God bless you my family you are my family not sure if you accept me as your family but I accept you as my family because all of us have been bed with the same blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe it with all my heart if You' be so kind and follow me to Romans 8 Romans 8:14 we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we thank God for giving us a privilege to speak his word Romans 8:14 reads for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage against a fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself be witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children and heirs HS of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together our uh theme this morning she is him she is him and when I say she is him it's this bride the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ converting into the groom doing the same thing the groom does behaving like the gr now this world doesn't know who it is now she wants to call himself him he wants to call him himself her or she wants to call herself they but can't identify with anything better said they don't want to identify with anything but this bride identifies with the groom this bride does not represent a last name does not represent a country does not represent an idea it represents him that's what she wants to be she wants to be him now so she can be him she needs to receive his messenger now Rebecca had to receive the messenger first the one sent for her in her time to recognize who she was until she received the messenger you know there's something attracting us to the messenger there's something I don't know how to explain it but there's something can someone tell me somebody can tell me there's nothing good to our side to say oh I love this Messenger as a matter of fact for our eyesight our human eyesight that vessel is filled with mistakes because it's a human vessel but it's what he represents because he doesn't represent himself the message he actually brought brought him from his master searching for a bride for his son his master's son so what he spoke was not of himself he never said fall in love with me elzar never told Rebecca fall in love with me look how I am how great I am no pointed to his master he pointed to his lord it's the same thing today for us in our day we must received our messenger and we need to recognize who our messenger today is you know when elizar found Rebecca one of the things that calls my attention the most that he found her in a well you know in the story of the Bible all the details matter all the details matter but when I met my wife I remember all the details every detail I'm not saying I remember the exact color of her dress but I remember everything happening around it was like a scene that was pre-planned a scene that was prepared already and I believe that's what we come searching this morning that's what I come searching for to have an encounter with my Lord to be closer to my Lord I desire to know how I can fall in love more with my Lord but to find out how I can fall in love more with my Lord I need to know what he demands of me and he demanded for Rebecca go to the well that's where he wanted to meet that's where God wants to meet us in the water well I want to tell you naturally what the water is what does water benefit us uh the functions of water in our body are multiple the most important are the following it allows the transport of nutrients to the cells it collaborates in the digestive process helps us get rid of what we don't need collaborates in the digestive process in breathing and in blood circulation it intervenes in the contraction of the muscles and gives flexibility and elasticity to the tissues it participates in the proper functioning of the brain and nerves it provides essential minerals such as calcium magnesium and fluoride which serve to strengthen bones and teeth it contributes to the regulation of body temperature it can keep us from being lukewarm I know you understand understand me and it delays the aging process well not sure if you were able to catch this but the Holy Spirit through our pastor last Sunday spoke about a scripture while he was reading but we have to pay attention to the details when God is speaking to us between both scriptures he read he said these words the words were he said everything we have in the spiritual realm everything we are or we desire to be be in the spiritual realm depends on our relationship with God all the fruit we're going to produce depends on our relationship with God if we're not connected with him in a relationship we cannot produce the fruit we should as Christians look for it it's in last week's preaching it's around the 23rd minute giving you the details but you know Psalms 1 says he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper shall prosper why he's connected to the Fountain this bride needs to be connected to the groom through the fountain earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints preach 1953 brother brandham said says and the Beautiful Rebecca came out and he said now now ever who Waters this camel he said Lord let that be the one you've chosen and Rebecca went and watered the camel and give them a drink look the very animal that she was watering the animal represents a beast of course a of course a beast of burden which means power in the Bible and the Very animal that she was watering was the very that packed her to see her bride cor is that right and what is watering the very power we're watering now with prais and Thanksgiving and glory and power and might is a very holy spirit that will pack us to see Jesus [Applause] someday what is that power what is this water that same Holy Spirit that's why this bride needs to be at the well connected with her groom drinking of this water drinking of this word expecting the bridegroom I remember another story very similar very similar it's the Samaritan woman you remember the Samaritan woman the Samaritan woman was also at the water well that's where God wants to meet us that's where he wants to meet us and he will meet us there he'll meet us in his word why does this grp want to meet his bride why does he want to meet her because she is him she is part of him he the groom it's not complete without her God is not complete without me I want you to repeat that this morning repeat it like you believe it God is not complete without me again again God is not complete without [Applause] me now when God found this Samaritan woman this Samaritan woman was not a ill Fame woman she was clearly living in adultery but she was always searching for her beloved she was always searching for someone to love and that's how we are today that's how we are right now that's why we're right here because there's something inside us that's crying for the groom and says I want to love him I want to love him there's something here that wants to answer to that love and that's how this Samaritan woman was here was this smarten woman she thought she was doing well that she wasn't doing anything wrong but she met with the word itself so the Lord Jesus Christ when he got to this well the Holy Spirit just the same way with Rebecca had already been moving and prepared the situation and if you prepared this morning the Holy Spirit has something for you I'm not sure what it is I don't know what it is believe the Holy Spirit has something for you because he promised that he would sent the angel before him to prepare the way when Jesus arrived he told his disciples I must pass through Samaria the holy spirit is leading me to Samaria you know when Jesus Christ is present it's easy to identify his presence is easily identified amen and you have to identify with him you have to identify with him so when the Lord Jesus Christ was present with this Samaritan woman she knew her intentions in her heart she knew her own Spirit she knew what her need was it's the same thing God knows about us this morning he knows what we have need of he knows everything you know this woman she met with the word itself so the first thing the Lord Jesus Christ did was to contact her spirit because very deep where she was there was an everlasting representation that he had already deposited there and that same representation had to meet with another representation to make contact and he could not do anything else but through God's word so then when she saw who was before her look Brethren put it this way so you can understand me better when she found the Lord Jesus Christ she was in a different or another relationship and that's where God wants to find us because many of us are not in our relationship with God we're in a relationship with someone else but he wants to find us he wants to meet us in his word you know this Samaritan woman knew about the word knew that the Messiah would come and would display everything that the Messiah would do but she had not found him yet she would attend church she paid her tithes but had not stepped into a relationship with God she knew how to do things she knew about God's word but there was nothing to activate that relationship with God until one day that God met with her and she realized six men or six previous relationships she was in didn't benefit her for anything but the seventh relationship this seventh relationship she had to find her beloved she had to find him she had found him and she said it seems you might be a prophet I think a prophet in this time we were sent a [Applause] prophet not only manifested all the virtues of a prophet but God himself supported this Prophet I don't need to lift up this Prophet God himself live raised him up all that I have to do believe this Prophet believe this messenger when she received the prophet's message she found out who she was and she said well I think you're a prophet like what you're speaking is the truth like I'm finding out I'm the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ until Rebecca received the messenger until that point she knew who she was brother brandom says Christ is a mystery of God revealed preached 1963 identified oh the devil is howling about this the Manifest the truth of the promise of the word in her alone he's speaking about the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he speaks about the religious people he says they don't have the answer Jesus come why didn't those Pharisees the answer he said if I cast out the Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by they had the word they had the word but not the power they didn't have the power to activate this this word see he stood alone and his church stands alone she's not hooked with anything but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body we're going to repeat this again she is his body the Manifest the truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power of the Vindicated word promised to her how a bride holds that promise he told me he returned after me I'll believe it you see it yes sir to meet her headship her Redeemer her husband her King her Lord heri in the provided meeting place he's got a place to meet them you know the bridegroom don't leave out nothing he's got the ring identification the robe she wears the Rope she wears her clothing see and he's got the provided place to me her that's in the air everything has been provided he's got the wedding supper already set guests are invited already chosen angels are standing around his servants at attention please stand he has everything provided he has provided everything already but he has to meet us in the place he has provided for every one of us and that's his word this bride [Music] all that she needs can only be satisfied in what he has nothing else can satisfy this bride look there was a [Music] woman that also used used water but the water that she used came out from her from within [Music] herself the woman that washed Jesus's [Music] feet you know she washed his feet with the water that was coming out from within her because she had recognized who she was and everything that she needed was [Music] him everything she needed was him watch this woman she never asked for anything when she got close to him she began to wash his feet she never said I need this I got to have that no [Music] no she didn't ask for anything she didn't ask for anything the only thing she needed was to be with him what she needed was to be closer to him and when she saw that opportunity she did not waste that opportunity look she was invited by a great [Music] man the Lord Jesus Christ was invited by a great man to his great home to his luxury home but had him in a corner where do we have the Lord Jesus Christ where have you placed him where you have where do I have him where have we put the Lord Jesus Christ he has been given to us in our hands he gave himself to us he gave everything for us he gave everything for his bride but his bride has him [Music] aside that's how this rich man had him and he said look look where you have placed [Music] me you invited me to your house you have me in your house right now you have me in your house you have me in your house and you haven't given me to [Music] eat you haven't paid attention mention to me and this woman from the moment she walked in has not stopped [Music] crying hasn't stopped watering me Father C Heavenly Father this morning Lord we recognize we fall short Lord we recognize we are that bride because we believe [Music] it [Music] Lord we understand we're in a [Music] process and you want complete control over our [Music] lives but Lord we set you aside we have time for other things Lord we have time for our jobs we have time for our family we have time for ourselves sometimes we say the time I'm in church is enough but this bride this bride wants to be him wants to be filled by him and the same spirit that was with him at Calvary and when his side was and delivered to our hands wants to dwell in us oh Lord if your bride could understand if she could understand who she was oh Lord oh lord the devil is afraid the devil's [Music] afraid because this bride is realizing who she is this bride is being filled with him this bride is standing for [Music] him she hasn't gone to the place she but she will get to that place and this devil is fighting with everything he has with all these demons so this bride cannot succeed to be what she needs to father if your bride we believe your bride is here we are part of your bride bride is part of you father you are incomplete without us and we are incomplete without you and we get to understand Lord if we are in a different relationship with with another God with another person may we return to to your word Lord come into this relationship in this love of and we begin to get deeper with you that is our desire as your bride [Music] Lord give you thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen bless
