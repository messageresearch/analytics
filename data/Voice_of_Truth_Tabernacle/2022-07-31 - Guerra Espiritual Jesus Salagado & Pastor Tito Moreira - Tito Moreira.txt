into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city [Applause] [Applause] jerusalem that's when he fought in the day of battle we need to understand something when the bible says then shall the lord go forth in english go forth that word in english uh it's not a term for coming out of a house [Applause] makes his move [Applause] shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives and the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst of toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south side and you shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mount shall reach unto us all ye yea ye shall flee like as he fled from before the earthquake in the days of yousei the king of judah and the lord my god shall come and it shall come to pass in that day that light shall not be clear nor dark now remember a prophet took the scripture from zachariah and place it in our time estas [Applause] but it shall be one day shall be known to the lord not day nor nigh but it shall come to pass at the evening time it shall be light this

promise that the messiah would come esperando he arrives arriving and like a baby and then he grows and he only spent time speaking of his father speaking of this kingdom i believe many were i think many were disappointed naturally isaiah says we see him with no attraction i say isaiah himself says in isaiah 54. no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against ye in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord 42 13 and the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry roar he shall prevail against his enemies [Applause] i believe that part of these prophecies were taking place while jesus was on that he sacrificed himself on the cross but the bible gives us another image from him of demons the devil also has his generals generally el diablo and the devil's generals were religious spirits that were fighting him
