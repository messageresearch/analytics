[23:29] [Music]
[23:48] thank you
[24:32] one brother
[24:48] foreign
[25:21] foreign
[25:56] is
[25:57] it time for you oh ye to dwell in your
[26:00] shielded houses and this house light
[26:02] ways
[26:06] now therefore the state the Lord of
[26:09] hosts consider your ways
[26:14] is
[26:25] bringing little ee but ye have not
[26:28] enough you drink but are not filled with
[26:30] drinky clothe you but there is none warm
[26:33] and ye have Earnest wages and he that
[26:35] earneth wages earneth wages to put into
[26:38] a bag with holes
[26:39] [Music]
[26:57] came to little and when you brought it
[26:59] home I did blow upon it why save the
[27:02] Lord of hosts because of mine house that
[27:04] is waste and you run every man unto his
[27:07] own house
[27:13] therefore the heaven over you stayed
[27:15] from Dew and the Earth is stayed from
[27:17] her fruit is
[27:29] and I called for a draw upon the land
[27:31] and upon the mountains upon the corn
[27:33] upon the new wine upon oil upon that
[27:35] which the ground bringeth forth and upon
[27:37] man and upon cattle and upon all the
[27:39] labor of hands
[27:42] I want you to notice one thing is
[27:52] they learn to live without the temple
[27:55] they learn
[28:02] without the presence of God
[28:05] and they were comfortable
[28:09] so that's what we want to speak foreign
[29:10] I'm the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may
[29:14] be seated
[29:17] we're finding out
[29:21] that is
[29:34] I believe it's with a purpose
[29:38] I believe God wants us to see something
[29:40] important
[29:43] God wants us to see the conditions
[29:54] and how that's the same that would
[29:57] happen in the last days
[30:00] and many of us are found in the same
[30:02] condition
[30:05] but the biggest problem I see is
[30:10] that we're satisfied the way we are
[31:13] they would have continued
[31:16] foreign
[31:36] [Applause]
[32:12] your works are wonderful says the Bible
[32:17] and truly the human being in
[32:22] is the most adaptable creature that
[32:25] exists on the earth
[32:27] there are some animals
[32:30] that cannot live
[32:35] if their habitat is changed
[32:39] for example polar bears
[32:43] polar bears cannot live in a desert
[32:47] implemented
[32:49] weren't made to live there
[32:53] so the people are very worried today
[33:00] because they're saying we need to save
[33:02] them
[33:03] if the ice melts in Antarctica
[33:07] the polar bears will stop existing
[33:13] camels cannot live in the ice
[33:17] if you change their habit to their
[33:19] environment
[33:21] they begin to die
[33:30] drastic changes to their lives
[33:33] but with people
[33:36] but the human being is
[33:39] the man or the woman is
[33:43] so adaptable
[33:48] the hottest places on the planet is
[33:55] to live in that environment
[34:00] where people living in Antarctica
[34:06] people that live in the coldest places
[34:08] in the earth
[34:19] such a humid place like Houston
[34:22] but people live there
[34:28] people can live in a cold place
[34:32] there's people living everywhere in the
[34:35] planet
[34:36] because a human being
[34:40] was wonderfully made
[34:43] to be very adaptive
[34:46] the changes that happen in their lives
[34:52] in the Philippine mountains Vietnam
[34:59] people in the in Vietnam
[35:04] there are people that are living in
[35:06] swamps with mud all the way to their
[35:08] knees
[35:09] and that's where they live
[35:12] they live
[35:16] there's people living
[35:21] of transportation is swimming or through
[35:24] a boat yeah you've even and that's where
[35:26] they live
[35:30] adapter
[35:34] there's people that adapt to the
[35:36] environment
[35:38] there's people that say
[35:41] s
[35:42] if I lose my beloved I don't know how I
[35:46] can live without them
[35:50] I won't be able to live without them
[35:52] there's people that lose their children
[35:55] lose their wife their husbands
[35:59] I don't know what's going to happen
[36:03] well that happens all the time
[36:06] and the human being attacked
[36:09] and the human being learns to live
[36:15] without that that was so important
[36:18] they simply adapt
[36:20] please keep living on and there's people
[36:22] that says
[36:24] how will I live if I lose my sights
[36:28] people learn to live without eyes
[36:52] from an accident
[36:55] and they simply adapt
[36:58] I was reading about this woman okay
[37:02] they didn't have legs or or hands
[37:07] it was just her torso with a head is
[37:13] shopping mall uh buying things
[37:18] how did she get accredited
[37:27] she had like a lever on her face
[37:35] to the sides and
[37:39] she was looking in the store what she
[37:42] could buy for Christmas
[37:44] how adaptable our woman right
[37:48] doesn't matter what they lose they're
[37:50] going shopping
[37:52] all right
[37:57] but the human being is so adaptable
[38:01] they learn to live
[38:05] under the conditions they're in
[38:09] um
[38:11] from a bird and see how long they live
[38:15] they won't be able to survive
[38:18] they'll die quickly
[38:21] for human beings
[38:25] it's almost changing everything or
[38:27] changing anything and their life can
[38:30] continue
[38:33] their lives continue
[38:37] but I believe the greatest tragedy
[38:40] of all humankind is
[38:44] Nosotros is
[38:47] when the human being
[38:50] learns to live without God
[38:53] there's no greater tragedy than this
[38:59] thing songs that say I can't live
[39:01] without you foreign
[39:22] [Applause]
[40:12] I imagine Eve told Adam what are we
[40:15] gonna do Adam
[40:18] let's learn to live without him
[40:22] he says that they fled from God's
[40:25] presence
[40:28] they were planning aprender Vivir sin
[40:32] dios to learn to live without God
[40:36] Adam and Eve
[40:39] Kain Kane
[40:44] when God punished him
[40:47] God says
[41:15] in other words My Punishment is too
[41:18] great I cannot bear it that's what it
[41:20] says
[41:23] I can't support this is
[41:35] behold thou has driven me out of the day
[41:38] from the face of the Earth and from thy
[41:40] face shall I be hid and I shall be a
[41:42] fugitive and a vagabond in the earth
[41:45] you throw me out of your presence
[41:49] I can't live with
[41:51] him
[41:54] unless he learn how to live well without
[41:56] him
[42:01] I look at Esau
[42:05] the Bible says in Hebrews 12 16
[42:11] foreign
[42:35] for you know how that afterward when he
[42:37] would have inherited the blessing he was
[42:39] rejected for he found no place of
[42:41] repentance though he started carefully
[42:43] with tears
[42:48] meditate on this
[42:55] he ran to his father
[42:58] I told him
[43:02] is there not one bless
[43:27] Genesis 33 is
[43:33] a chapter before when Jacob fought
[43:40] because Jacob was so fearful that he
[43:42] would face once again his brother is
[43:46] he stole his Birthright his Blessing is
[43:53] and after that happens for the first
[43:56] time again he's about to meet
[43:59] and he thinks Esau is going to kill him
[44:03] foreign
[45:26] raised in the sight of my Lord
[45:29] now watch Easton verse 9.
[45:37] I have enough my brother
[45:41] keep that that thou Hast unto thyself in
[45:45] other words
[45:51] I've learned and I'm happy without the
[45:53] blessing with from God
[46:05] now just watch brother
[46:09] Jacob was
[46:14] handmaidens and services
[46:26] it and Esau says I'm well I don't need
[46:30] it I have enough just like
[46:33] contento I'm happy
[46:37] now this same condition is
[46:41] the condition that the church in the
[46:43] last days would be in the Bible does
[46:47] revelation 3 this is
[47:08] later says
[47:20] that has Jesus outside of the church
[47:25] and they are satisfied
[47:31] and the message
[47:33] door to the heart this is
[47:40] did you know we got the Christian church
[47:42] has its greatest buildings it's ever had
[47:46] you know it's richer than it ever was
[47:52] you know that they got the best
[47:54] theologians they ever had
[48:10] is reaching towards heaven with half a
[48:13] million dollar pipe organs it's it's
[48:15] robed
[48:17] choirsos
[48:22] it's Scholars polished stuff from the
[48:25] Seminary to the very latest dots Los
[48:27] Cuates
[48:31] who can walk through the platform and
[48:33] not make one grammatic mistake
[48:38] who can limit their sermons to so much
[48:40] time with so much
[48:46] psychology that can hold up people's
[48:48] minds to the thought that they've got
[48:51] is
[48:57] noodles
[48:59] I don't know it is
[49:32] his best condition
[49:35] my mind
[49:40] has learned to live without God bless
[49:42] you Miss March itself
[49:47] have learned to live without Christ
[49:52] and preachers
[49:59] and Christ is outside of the door
[50:03] is the door of their own church
[50:09] and they say we are fine
[50:15] this is the same condition
[50:19] the church was the Bible says
[50:32] also in the latest days
[50:35] time shall come
[50:38] second Timothy three
[50:42] verse one thank you they says
[50:49] for men shall be lovers of their own
[50:51] selves
[50:58] don't put it out there
[51:01] amongst us
[51:04] for the shall be lovers of their own
[51:06] songs
[51:24] of those that are good
[51:28] verse 5 having a form of godliness
[51:41] yesterday's will be in Matthew 24. he
[51:44] said verse 37.
[51:47] [Applause]
[51:54] for us
[52:10] notice what the sign of the enzyme would
[52:12] be
[52:56] we've accepted
[52:59] Church
[53:10] nevertheless
[53:12] for ourselves
[53:15] lovers of ourselves
[53:21] God
[53:24] we're well
[53:26] foreign
[53:46] God is not there with them
[53:51] we've learned
[53:58] religious
[54:00] by routine
[54:08] at some point we cry for the holy ghosts
[54:28] but now and they
[54:30] said we've forgotten about him
[54:36] we've forgotten many times
[54:43] but at the moment when we desire God to
[54:45] give us the fullness of his holy spirit
[54:52] speaks of that man
[54:54] that's that Lord
[54:59] when he was angry with his ass
[55:02] and he said Lord
[55:05] you don't give me the holy ghosts
[55:11] have we every cried to God in that way
[55:19] Lord
[55:28] you know but you know what happens time
[55:31] passes
[55:34] and we learn to live without it
[55:39] we learned to live without the Holy
[55:42] Ghost In Our Lives
[55:43] to guide ourselves
[55:46] a
[55:49] we learned to live without the guidance
[55:52] of the Holy Ghost
[55:57] the problem with learning to live
[56:00] without him
[56:02] is
[56:03] that one day we will die without him
[56:08] and that's where we'll worry
[56:13] the Bible says as it was in the time of
[56:15] nowhere and the people ran came and went
[56:22] they focused on their own lives
[56:28] they forgot about God
[56:32] hasta
[56:33] until he says it says until
[56:38] until the flood came
[56:42] then they remembered about God
[56:45] I was reading about this woman okay
[56:56] they knew you were in church
[57:02] because then two three feet deep of snow
[57:04] she didn't have a job
[57:06] she didn't have a lot of money
[57:09] she had very little to eat
[57:13] and says
[57:16] she was always early in the service
[57:21] and she was saying I cannot live without
[57:23] God
[57:34] go higher
[57:41] to the point where she didn't go to
[57:43] church anymore
[57:48] and the pastor went
[57:53] because
[57:56] he was dying of cancer
[58:01] and he said I expected to see her how I
[58:04] knew her how she loved God
[58:06] a person so devoted for years
[58:10] for years
[58:14] sacrificed everything for God
[58:21] she got so far from God
[58:35] it makes us think we don't need him
[58:38] he replaces God's things
[58:41] with other things
[58:44] that we don't need God anymore
[58:58] she was afraid to die without God
[59:05] people learn to live without god
[59:10] without God we learn to live without him
[59:16] tell it
[59:18] you know
[59:21] one time
[59:26] God took everything from jobos his
[59:30] children
[59:31] and he learned to live without them
[59:37] his children his cattle his money
[59:41] his health
[59:45] and job learned to live without all of
[59:47] that
[1:00:17] I
[1:00:22] cannot live without him
[1:00:43] without his presence
[1:00:57] [Applause]
[1:00:59] told them what are you doing
[1:01:04] I believe it's the same in our time
[1:01:07] it's been God's grace
[1:02:12] it can still be done
[1:02:15] amazing
[1:02:18] this element Brandon brother Branham
[1:02:20] says
[1:02:24] the message why I'm against organized
[1:02:27] religion say notice is
[1:02:30] this is the angel of Light
[1:02:33] remember the last time
[1:02:36] it's the Angel and the child
[1:02:42] that's the age we live in brothers
[1:02:47] that is
[1:02:51] the very next chapter is a 19.
[1:02:54] which is the coming bride yes
[1:02:57] and this is
[1:03:00] the last angel that came to bring life
[1:03:04] before the coming of the Bride
[1:03:07] call me Christ
[1:03:11] it was the loudest sea in church age
[1:03:14] then
[1:03:15] outside
[1:04:17] that we have of Christ on the outside
[1:04:23] knocking trying to get in
[1:04:27] the only church age
[1:04:33] how to do everything without God
[1:05:07] guiding Our Lives
[1:05:31] for them
[1:05:35] this trip we made to Israel we found out
[1:05:41] much that Temple matters to the Jews
[1:05:47] you can't do the sacrifices
[1:05:53] if it's not active
[1:05:57] they believe so much and that temple in
[1:06:01] that place
[1:06:13] that's where Adam was
[1:06:16] [Applause]
[1:06:31] that's where Abraham Casio fresia
[1:06:36] Isaac in sacrifice
[1:06:43] for the first Adam worship God
[1:07:08] as close as possible to that place
[1:07:15] and cry to God
[1:07:18] for God to restore that Temple
[1:07:21] it means so much to them
[1:07:31] and I can imagine that
[1:07:34] how much they dream foreign
[1:07:51] back then
[1:07:55] fundamental and simply see a foundation
[1:07:58] without God should kind of Glory with
[1:08:01] them
[1:08:06] they surely continue reading about Moses
[1:08:11] but God's presence was missing
[1:08:14] the sacrifices weren't there
[1:08:18] foreign
[1:08:53] yes
[1:09:04] God's grace that reached these prophets
[1:09:08] and told them what are you doing
[1:09:10] why have you learned to live without it
[1:09:14] why are you thinking
[1:09:20] no it's Grace in our time
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:42] in your life
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:49] why are we
[1:09:53] so calm
[1:10:05] foreign
[1:10:10] I heard a brother
[1:10:14] he said
[1:10:27] speaking on his last daughter he had

[1:15:14] La Iglesia the church
[1:15:16] the church
[1:15:19] has learned to live without God
[1:15:23] oh Lord
[1:15:32] have learned to live without the Holy
[1:15:34] Ghost
[1:15:37] but it's time
[1:15:40] to stand to stop because
[1:15:45] consider our ways
[1:15:51] to recognize our state
[1:15:56] and return to the Altar
[1:15:58] and say God
[1:16:02] and one occasion I cry for the holy
[1:16:05] ghost
[1:16:08] at some point I told you that I needed
[1:16:11] you
[1:16:12] what has happened with my life

[1:16:48] leave what you must
[1:16:52] you'll learn to live without it
[1:16:55] without the things of this world but do
[1:16:59] it for God
[1:17:16] without God's presence in your life
[1:17:21] don't let another day pass
[1:17:25] without the Holy Ghost
[1:17:28] being the greatest in your life
[1:17:44] to lose
[1:17:49] but don't let another day pass
[1:17:55] es without the holy ghost in your lives
[1:18:07] that would be the greatest tragedy of
[1:18:09] your life because
[1:18:12] if you learn to live without him
[1:18:16] you have to suffer without him
[1:18:20] you'll have to die without him
