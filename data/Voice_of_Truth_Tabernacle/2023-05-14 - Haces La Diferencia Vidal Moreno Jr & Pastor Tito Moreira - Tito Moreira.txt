[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all right please [Music] God bless you brother uh pleasure to be in the house of God on a Mother's Day may God bless all of you bless your efforts we're going to try to do our best to express what a mother is there's many things that a mother does yeah event and a lot of it is insane I mean can you open your Bibles with me Galatians chapter six and verse 9. um foreign you make the difference and the word of God reads emos and let us not be worrying and well doing for in due season we shall rip if reap if we faint not um one more scripture second Corinthians chapter 12 verse and verse 9. and then second Corinthians 12 9. um and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness let's bow our heads will be praying Celestial Heavenly Father gracias we give you thanks for the girl that you've been with us Lord we ask that you make yourself present one more time you express yourself to your servants that you manifest yourself one more time through your word and at the end of the service all honor and glory be for you we give you thanks for everything we ask all these things amen amen you may be seated brother uh you make the difference yeah you know uh I was uh just kind of meditating a little bit and uh you know a lot of times what the mothers do they're not seeing noise they don't get a lot of credit you know for some of the things that are done you know and one of the stories you know it's actually a movie and uh it's it's uh it's the 300 Spartans uh and uh everybody knows those of you that have seen the movie you know the the main the main guys uh they're they're the 300 Spartans yeah but you know doing a little bit of of reading and and just looking into the history of of the 300 Spartans uh you know I I come to find out that uh when uh King Leonidas uh when he when he decides to choose the 300 Spartans there's actually more to uh the story and Sierra uh then uh just these guys that knew how to fight these these Men of War you know with big muscles you know they knew how to use the shields they knew how to use the the sword as well as the spears so it was more than just that to the choosing of the 300s foreignitas actually uh the reason he chose them was because of the mothers and the wives that they had that was the reason that the 300 Spartans were chosen had nothing to do with the men's bravery although they had to have it it had nothing to do with their own strength but uh it was it was more about the character that they had developed through the women they were actually behind them amen amen and uh you know so that was that's they said that that's tradition that was a tradition that was said back then but when I read the story I was like man I believe that I believed it 100 percent because before I read the story I actually read what brother Branham says presuming he says in the fall of the nation it says as soon as a motherhood was broke and Womanhood that nation's backbone was broken the eldice and then and then there's another one that I like also and it's it it's it talks about the same thing but he says this is in the message the world is falling apart and that's the backbone of the nation yes it says you break motherhood says you broke it you broke the nation right then so that's one thing that hold that helps hold it together it's real genuine Parenthood you know when we talk about the 300. you know and and and what they did you see nobody talks about the women that were behind them nobody talks about the women and the mothers that actually helped raise these Warriors nobody talks about who fed these men because you can't go out to Wars if you're not well fed you said you see you gotta eat rice you gotta have the right you gotta have the right characters correct in order to go to a war you see but the greatest the greatest thing to me is that Leonidas when he when he was thinking about who was going to go with him he was thinking about the future he was thinking about the future of Greece that's what he was thinking so when you when you go back when you go back in and see that and he leaves these women and these wives and mothers you see a lot of it was entrusted in them and what they were all about so these women the man would not go unless the woman was behind the man unless the woman was behind the man the man was not gonna go to war because Leonidas understood he understood that if these women if they if these women lost their heads if they if they went into depression if they went into Despair and then the whole nation yes a seed was deposited foreign [Music] good I believe that I really enjoyed that story and you know when we talk about women not only women but mothers you know they don't they don't get a lot of credits [Music] they don't get matter of fact I don't think they get hardly anyone Recon you know the last name they take the husband's last name you see so they're willing to uh sacrifice you know even their their last name [Music] for a greater cause amen amen and there's just so much other things that they sacrifice you know there's you know there's the the children uh you know sometimes they're thirsty I've seen it you know a lot of times uh where you know the mother she's got her own she's got her own coke you know and then you got the little kids no they're eating crackers you know Takis Takis you know they're just eating there and you know they're all dirty yeah and they want a drink well the mom has the only drink hold me close to her and you know the kid comes and she sees his face full red stuff crackers on his face and she knows what's going to happen he wants a drink and uh you know she looks at him and she realizes that when she gives that drink away oh she's not gonna get it back the same there's gonna be all kinds of Little Fishies floating around that's what it is [Music] they're just gonna be floating around in her drinks and so you know the drink isn't the same anymore the mother sacrificed that because you know she loves her children those those are just some of the small things you know that the mother sacrificed for their children you know a lot of times you know the young man the teenagers uh [Music] you know there's a lot of times you know the mom's got she's got her stash la madre and mom goes over there when she wants a chocolate or something she no longer has the chocolate because the kids ate it you know it's just it's just some of those things you know that mothers you know are willing to sacrifice you know for the children you know not realizing you know that that it's small things like that it's it's sharing those things you know a lot of times giving it and getting nothing back in return that actually makes the difference it makes the difference you know he has this other quote and I really like it it's in the message my life story now a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown she should be honored my mother's a woman my wife is and they're lovely yeah I've got thousands of Christian sisters who I highly respect if they can respect what God made them so I'm going to read that again but if they can respect what God made them a motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man you see I I want to read that I'm going to read one more time but if they can respect what God made them you know when he says you know I I like what he says let's read it again I don't want to misquote it he says my grace is sufficient for thee how much I would look at you know I'd look at her in tears [Music] she can still enough way that was how could I put it come on up all the cedar that was the decision that was the easiest okay to leave to walk away the irsay and she stayed there I wonder how many women how many women of the of the wives of the Spartans didn't want to go out there and fight and you know they just a lot of times women man if they had the straight to men they'd make better Warriors tears [Applause] uh [Music] if you're crying for Joy it's different you know because something something strong something that's really strong it derives he he can't cry Meyer you cannot Cry by her hello you know but better he has to be strong for her you got to be strong for her that's why men are strong because it comes from a softer side always expect your husband to cry with you he's crying inside but he's trying to stay strong stay strong you know in God's the same way you know he came elvino he was willing to endure he stayed strong he stayed strong because he loves something so much he loves you so much that he was willing to endure yeah [Music] God bless you [Applause] happy Mother's Day to everyone may God bless you all um whether you be a mother or not I stand and also the men and we love you as your pastor I love you and always hope to be of service for you let's read first Samuel let's go over it one more time there's always new thing God shows us I want to tell the children the greatest gift you can give your parents is there's nothing that would make them happier there's nothing you can give them that would make them happier and for you to surrender to Christ and you surrender your heart to the Lord so if you're thinking about gifting your mother something why not say Lord help me so give you my heart and prove with my life what my mother taught me has made an effect on me that's the greatest thing a son can do furthermore now there was a certain man of Ramadan zofim of Mount Ephraim and his name was alkana the son of jeroham the son of elio the son of tohu the son observed and efferite foreign and he had two wives the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other penina and penina had children but Hannah had no children just because the Bible reports the truth of the case does it mean it supports it is like a newspaper reporting homicide or anything does it mean that newspaper supports this Behavior are you with me so for you to see polygamy here doesn't mean the Bible is simply saying the truth of the case here this is and this man went up out of his City yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hoffney and Phineas the priests of the Lord were there and when the time that was was that alcana offered he gave to penina his wife ought to her sons and to and her daughters portions [Music] he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had showed up her womb now there are medical terms when someone cannot have children and science calls them different names but at the end the one with the final decision is and we want to see that foreign is and her adversary also provoked her soar for to make her heart for to make her fret because the Lord had showed up her womb so it wasn't enough that she didn't have children they still try to irritate her on purpose and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat all right now verse 8 is a little funny por que no comes on and why it is thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not I better to thee than ten Sons what's funny is that Hannah didn't reply anything am I not better than 10 Sons am I not better than five those two centado sword is if that will indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmaid and remember me now forget that is no razor come upon his head first thing I want you to notice about Hannah important was how important it was for her to be a mother he was not better or good enough notice the importance I understand today is today maybe there was nothing wrong with her implement because God wanted to give her a greater blessing all she wanted was a son and God wanted to give her a prophet um [Applause] Kings of Israel first man King David all she wanted was a man-child she was not anyone important but God was holding the blessings and so she got to the point where she could vow this because when she got to the point everything changed I wanted to bring you thus far yeah God is holding back the blessing many times it doesn't mean God isn't hearing yourself especially from uh so take me to the point where I'm ready foreign give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head now notice how much she was willing to sacrifice is willing to sacrifice her life her desires What She Likes many times we like to box in what we think a mother is certain way and if it's not that way then she's not a mother but I want to expand your way of things because many times we think of mothers is she that is protecting her children day and night and doesn't let anything bad happen to them but Hannah gave him God so what we think about a mother I will let this say the Bible says in primate first Timothy 2 15. if you read verses says a woman who's not called to preach the woman is not called to minister or be a pastor but then she receives her colleagues but then God gives her it is Holiness with sobriety God gives a woman a woman can have is Mother no [Music] usted again you can stretch it more than someone that has had a child okay mujeres because there are women that have never had a child but our mothers for others I repeat it again there are women that have never had children but have been a mother for many think about that for a moment mujeres one more time this should help the women then how will I be saved if I've never had children if I've never had a child because the Bible says women shall be saved God gave the woman this is they have the gift of raising she has the gifts because God gave man certain gifts and people say well it's not fair the woman wants to be like the man who will be a mother if the woman takes a man's place that brings the backbone of our church of a Nation you know a pastor's job would it be lighter is that okay there will be a little bit of everything this morning the pastor's job will be much lighter porque I query because how difficult it is with the youth right [Music] look mothers Siempre you don't have to like it all the time it's okay I sometimes don't like the calling God gave me but I understand I gave you the gift of motherhood it's up to you to um develop it as a pastor let me tell you when I began I am nothing like what I am Services 10 15 years ago I look at myself and I'm embarrassed I'll say oh Lord how I stuttered because you don't start knowing everything thanks to God I didn't give up I believe God is I would have given up a long time ago principles that's how it is oh God will help a Perfection I need to finish before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth only her lips move but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken and today is it's simply a fact and men are the ones that complain the most I believe that's why God is more present so the sisters of women because they need that right more than men do yes decisions and we still criticize them foreign answered and said no my Lord I'm a woman of a sorrowful spirit it's my spirit that needs rest how many sisters have poured out my soul before the Lord for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hither too damn pass go in peace granted thy petition now has asked of him and she says I want you to notice this final description the musicians can come yeah and and did eat and yet so the woman went her way Angelina and her accountants was no more sad notice and the last part is and her countenance was no more sense and her countenance was God had not answered yesterday God had not given us God hadn't given her any confirmation yet but she received her rest in God she received what she needed the day she went to church [Music] [Music] and left a different woman God didn't promise for anything Spirit was different and her countenance was no more sad how many believe God can do that for us I believe if there's praying Warriors it's the women foreign I doubt there's many men that pray like the woman and they pray because they're they have need Ed they have much more stress than men not only are they mothers sometimes but they are they're also providers for their home sometimes we're giving them double work yeah this is and sometimes they're the only provider that home has even more work now but I just want to invite for you to come like Hannah Bengal come to him he can give you the rest you need is you are one massage away from feeling well it was a place for massages and I tell you your only one time away to spend with God to feel better to receive what your heart needs God has what you need doesn't matter what you have Dios God can help you let's all stand to all the mothers to all that have been mothers for others gracias thank you gracias thank you for everything you've done gracias poor meet in uavisto look I've seen I've seen people that aren't someone's mother and they still raise they still help the todas maneras they are still the ones that are there too you also have the gift of motherhood everyone has the gift of motherhood that gift of sacrifice and there might be a mother here maybe it doesn't fit in the box of what a mother is well you've made great sacrifices that also is motherhood because you don't do it thinking about yourself you do it thinking about the rest gracias thank you gracias thank you our homes in our family you make all the difference thank God always is you and if you need anything on God's behalf I believe God can grant that to you come to him speak with him pour your heart out if you are tired if God bless you sisters [Music] [Music] Senora oh Hallelujah [Music] it is [Music] [Applause] [Music]

Men We Will ordain uh yokare I believe they have an unfeigned Faith I've seen uh what they preach they believe what they stand for is and we simply want to recognize that this is my grandmother Lois and I mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in thee also okay thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by putting on of my hands I'm a person that sees the scripture in different angles but the way I take it is gave Timothy the gifts but the pudding on of hands maybe help stir the gift of God not at the pudding of hands gave him the gifts putting of hands help him stir up the fire and that's what we want to do no man gives kids all gifts come from God says law but I believe when we recognize it or this man okay so Aviv that is and take a higher responsibility working for the kingdom of
