to matthew chapter 3 verse 15 and 17. and jesus answered and said unto him suffer it be to be so so now and for those become it and fulfill all righteousness and then he suffered him pero jesus and jesus when he was baptized went up a went up straight away out of the water and lo lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god then sending like a dove foreign upon him sorry i

speaking about identifying ourselves before our maker he knew what was his purpose when he came you know he he when when he he was walking every day you know he knew what what purpose was el salvia proposition he knew that he was going to be here for a sacrifice he knew what he was here for el salvia para que venia he was here to sacrifice himself for us he knew his identity he knew that there was going to be a sacrifice on sacrifice he knew that there had to be something fulfilled brother branham new york well brother branham said i'm sorry when when he sacrificed himself sacrificio you know that's when we received our identifications [Music] and matthew and matthew 16 21 ma tell us he says you know when he was talking to his disciples that for from that time forth began jesus showed unto his disciples that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders the chiefs the prius the priest and scribes and be killed and be re rised again on the third day says he already knew what was going to happen he could have sent archangels to destroy everything and it would have been over you know but he chose that path he chose that sacrifice sacrificio so we can receive our identification identification you know and sometimes we just have trouble finding our identification muchas you know we're just so stuck to these things here on earth you know and and then one day it's going to get to the point you know it i don't know how many of you no se cuantos ustedes you know being close to death you know in in a place you know where where where you know when you don't know when you don't know if you're going to make it or not you know i remember when i was 14 years old you know when i was when i got had garden in my car accident an accidental automobilistico you know and i remember just sitting laying there in bed you know and and it seemed like there was nothing to be done for me you know i remember my my muscles getting stiff musculos says you know i remember you know i i just remember seeing white recorder blanco you know i couldn't speak nobody have lar i couldn't breathe nope doesn't matter how hard i tried it you know i was just stuck there just you know there was nothing that could have probably happened to me it always know there's nobody remember me you know there was nothing that could probably could have been done for me you know in that moment i didn't know where i was going and that's a moment you know either you know i i grew up i grew up in in the catholic home yo chris you know they never really told me much about god no comments all they showed me is how to how to do the the holy mary's and the and and and all those prayers that you need to do solomon maria [Music] you know i didn't know where i was going to go you know say along day right yo you know we don't want to get to that point you know when we're dying in bed you know not knowing and not knowing where we're going you know we just gotta we just got to try tenemos que tentarlo you know we got to try our best to give ourselves to god it is not easy god's nose is not easy [Music] [Music] words i am here yo estoyaki show me what i need to do show me who am i i know i am full of failures you know i know that the world looks at me as an outsider you know someone probably a weirdo alcantara maybe a little listening to what brother uh vidal was saying last year last week you know when brother brandon has brother bossword cuando el mano brandon bosworth you know where is he going i don't you know that's something ugly fail when you don't know where you're going well you're just lost oh you know you don't have to read the whole bible in one day you know sometimes you just have to close your eyes just for a few seconds and say thank you god for today thank you for letting me see another day you know it just has to take baby steps little by little it's all processed so you just gotta trust yourself that you're gonna let god come into your life and give you an identity sweden i want to read a quote from brother branham it's from the message uh supernatural amen i don't know how to pronounce the second word easily messiah why don't you just step off for a few minutes and go looking around at the bible might wander around and you might find yours yourself identified you may come to yourself like the prodigal son did come here and find yourself you might find your identification in the words of god identification you know that's where you're going to find yourself that's where you're going to find your purpose you know are these people that have been passing away around us you know all these people we all know someone that passed away from kovid you know or different things or you know and some of them when they die maybe they knew where they were going you know where exactly they're going exactly destination that's because they did not have their identification yes you know you have an opportunity you can do it every day what's my identity i don't want to die leaving this earth you know not knowing where i'm going you know i want to know where i'm going i know i want to know what direction i'm going to direction [Music] just meditate on it think about it find your identification and contrast foreign if we can please you want to help me out then thessalonians 4 16 please cuatro amen and the title in which we and my brother felix have put it yes amen first thessalonians 4 chapter 6 verse 16. primarily it says like this for the lord for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with a trumpet of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord just [Music] for wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen you may be seated um like i said we'll be trying to share the word as best and let god take control amen and then this uh in this night an esta noche a theme in which they've been preached on fridays now he's being prepared is being prepared to leave this earth yes [Music] it's a desire for anyone every son and daughter of god leave this earth but the only way that would be able to leave this earth is truly to be identified as part of him como because the only thing that god is coming back is of what is his es part of him and that's why it's very important important that's us young people sienna hoveness to identify who we truly are in this day and age all right all right that's good that's good once i started counting more again i say it again the only way we are able to be lonely taken off from this earth must be truly identified identificado in christ jesus and christo jesus as they said in first thessalonians as we just read and the dead in christ shall rise first he los muertos and them in the clouds [Applause] the lord in the air el senor we all want to son of god at the resurrection the second coming of the lord and my question again as young people like any other one where you go out on a plane trip and oh sorry trying to find the message here but he says it's not much about packing it's communion it's it's unpacking letting go despojando putting aside taking us up from this earth but i say again being identified before creators because that's the first thing we must do try and it depends it depends on which spirit you and the cual espirito want to be controlled by the siesta controllado and like i said again the only thing that god is coming back for is of himself foreign i see that the only thing the hindus from doing something in your life that said algo and suvida is yourself s usted mismo but it goes beyond that because you may ask yourself well brother i i don't know and truly start positioning yourself in the correct position in which god wants you because the world is desiring crying out for the true manifestation of the children [Music] and our worst but once i can truly identify that identify recognize reconocerlo that i am wrong estoy incorrecto then i come to my father don says i come to the altar son and daughter of god i can come against you brother branham talks about it as a little man who walks out in traffic okay nothing impressive you know many times we think there's nothing oppressive about us we think that we have to be someone great of great name something great here at church i said i'll go grand then like truly god can identify himself in us you can be the doormat of the church but it's identified as part of christ and all he does is wave his hand but he has an identity he has a badge that identifies them as a police officer when he walks out into traffic traffic knows they must stop because it's the exact same thing because once the devil knows that you know who you truly are then he finds himself in a pickle and tons of salsa encounters ousted who you truly are but it's first identifying pero primero i say this word a lot of this is the only word take this one word he loves the youth with all his kids talking about how hi being a another just a rat another young person he cuts me off and tells me no you're not just anybody because if they and i wouldn't be dealing with the things i am dealing with now endless problems the things that people tell me medicine all the drama cheese man i think those things wouldn't matter to me the criticism because day by day does not matter the more you more you try to identify yourself in christ the more and more the devil tries to attack you mask the more precious is the reward in christ jesus and christo jesus there's nothing he can throw you away there's nothing he can throw you away there's nothing you can do to you know but my question is to you tonight do you truly want to be identified that he's coming back for portland i'm not drinking anything special i'm pretty much being an echo what are you doing today questa siendo hoy that is truly pushing you quello estan pujando to truly identify yourself with him because what identifies you por que lo que lo dientifique a change of nature you may say that's a lot to ask for well we're living in the darkest stage how much are you truly preparing yourself have you been taking the preachings that have been preached to us beforehand applying them to your life trying to live them the best way that you can know cause the only thing that can show us where we're going who we are yes it tells you where you come from what you are here and where you are going so therefore if we want to know where we're from where we want where we're going to vamos aqui let's take the only book that can tell us we are able to that there's nothing he can do but flee okay and he flees yes pound them what spirit is controlling you que espirito lo de tienoste lo control what desires do you have que the sales team usted ask yourself but i want this uh am i really truly preparing myself although it may not be
