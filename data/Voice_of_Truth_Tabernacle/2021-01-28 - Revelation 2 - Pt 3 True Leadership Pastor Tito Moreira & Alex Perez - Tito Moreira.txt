but we we've gotten into the church ages and we'll be speaking about the the first age which is the Ephesus Church age and out of there we want to take out things that that that uh we can um that can help us in our personal lives because in the end I believe that the whole word can help us each one of us so let us read Revelations chapter 2 verse one and on unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things said he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walth in the midst of the golden candlesticks let us pray Lord Jesus I thank you my God for being here amongst us we believe you're here with us uh we may come however we may come sometimes we come weary perturbed sometimes we come in a rush but we believe you make yourself present and that we have an appointment with you here this evening thank you Lord he would allow that this word be of help to your children and that we would learn we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I'm going to speak be speaking a little bit about verse one and then brother Alex will speak on verse two but we want to continue with with the the church age I want you in your [Music] notes Church AG or beneath I want you to write this down because this is a a big subject on on this age for this church that was in this beginning and the word is leadership it will be a a main thought of of this age he begins speaking about the Seven stars that are that that he holds in his right hand and we know those seven stars are the seven messengers of each age the seven messengers of the seven Church ages F further on he says that we have he has proved those that say that they are Apostles but they are not and has found them Liars further on it says but this thou has that thou hatest the Deeds of the nians this this all speaks about leadership say after me it it matters who I follow I say it again we can all say it together it matters who I follow I want that that as as we are are learning from the Ephesus Church age as we study it you you are seeing that that subject that that that thread how God says that uh to start with start to start well you have to to see who you are following okay that's right we're we're starting uh we're talking about the beginnings the beginnings of the church and we want a good foundation in our lives how many want a good foundation in their lives the Bible says edify or build on on the foundation the apostles and the prophets yes that's other verse I have there Ephesians 220 and are built upon the foundations of the Apostles and Prophets I want you to to uh understand if you want to have a good foundation uh you need to know who you're following that's [Applause] right we are all following someone all of us even if you're not following brother Tito or or brother brand brother we're all following somebody there are some that are following their wives it's the truth Brothers there are some that are following the the most the one that Goss the most in the church there are some that are following their own thoughts and all of that will take you to a a wrong Foundation God needs for you to follow the right person if there's going to be a right foundation there has to be a right leadership and God established in this first church in this first age in this first group he established apostles isn't that right they weren't the best the most religious or the most the most holy they were Sinners right Peter Matthew andn jaob he called them the sons of thunder because they were tremendous to call fire down from heaven to kill the people they they were very very angry people but God chose of the worst and made us go through through the fire of the Holy Ghost so that he could transform them and so that that that could demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost and the true leadership of the Holy Ghost and God tells this age I need you to know who you are following I need you to know who your leader is I ask you this question do you know who you're following or do you do as you please that's why we are how we are God begins in the greeting first verse in the greeting put the greeting God lets him know that he is the beginning from the of that he is the same in the beginning of the churches all the way to the end in every church he is the same in other words he has the same power in his right hand of his brother of his right hand in every age that's why it says the one that holded the Seven Stars in his right hand the the Seven Stars the Seven Stars Brothers he speaking of the seven Messengers the leader of the age comes with the same power of God in every age same in the first agage all the way to the last AG just how the church began with the Servants of God serving as these Apostles how they serve the people that's how he would be in every age and they set the example these Messengers set the example so that we would know what type of leaders to follow are you with me so all this whole age has to do with leadership and what type of leaders God wants that's why when God inaugurated the church he tells them this is the way the leaders will be in this in the Kingdom they will serve the brother they won't be as the others that they try to uh to be to govern or try to control uh the others and that is why God tells this age if you do not repent I will take away your Candlestick I will take your leader that's what brother brandom says I will take your pastor this whole age has to do with leadership who are you following who which are the true leaders that we should be following what is the condescension of God and how should those leaders be ask brother Alex to come forward glory to God how tremendous Brothers I don't know if you got your my notes out back how many are happy to be here this this evening um second slide please it begins saying Revelations chapter 2 verse two it says I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience I'd like to read this this quote Jessie lman of of this this person Jess Jesse Layman he he wrote This Book of the the story of of the the church agents and he says uh these words the love of Christ that burned in the hearts of these people would allow them to to show a love to to their fellow disciples a Unity of spirit a joy in the in communion and especially an interest [Music] the members of the church what a tremendous quote of from because this has just told [Music] us that when they received this message of of the first age the love of Christ that burned in their hearts when the word came to them they couldn't do anything else but but but to demonstrate to demonstrate that love because I receive that love we receive that love of God and we don't stay with that love something burned within their hearts so that they would express it because love is expressed one can express the love of God that one has received is to to love our our fellow Brethren that means that the people of Ephesus this first [Music] age when they Lear learned and received the love of God it they automatically began to work automatically began to serve that's why John the the writer God through John writing he he he Praises he says I Know Thy works the works of the Ephesians were works that demonstrated love were works that demonstrated the interest in others what a tremendous Foundation Foundation when the church was founded the the the beginnings the interest of one for the other for one another I ask the same passion would be in each one of us so I Know Thy works and and and and and that th thy Work for for who to build my own kingdom they knew in what kingdom they were working in they knew they had to reflect that love the interest for one another in the book of the the the the exposition of the seven Church ages it says like this don't ever be discouraged saint of God that's what God tells us this evening don't ever be discouraged people I repeat let's not be discouraged because God is does not God does not ungracious to forget your labor of love God is telling us this evening don't become discouraged don't get discouraged God does not forget when you show love towards someone he does not forget when you share the love of God to others because what we do for God and for our Brethren the Bible says how can I say I love my brother if I don't or love God if I don't love my brother the love of God is reflected in in the in the love that I show my the work that I do for God that demonstrates I do something for my brothers that's the only way hand in hand so to whatever we do even giving a cup of water to someone has a reward and blessing from the Lord notice how he he relates this the love of God to to the love reflected to the people yes sir that's right how can we say we love our brothers easy serving our Brethren that's right how can I find out that I that I truly love God when with in my with my actions because there's an action and me giving somebody a glass of water not only am I just am I saying it but I'm expressing it I'm taking action from what is within me yes sir amen I could tell you I I love you all but if I don't demonstrate with deeds in in in in action I I truly would wouldn't love you very much God never forgets what we do Brothers next slide please I want to tell you this evening that what we do for God God never forgets it the Church of of of the Ephesians before they they lost that first love they were a church that was rich in love we said it the previous time you cannot lose something you never had so that they could leave their first love lose their first love because at one point they had that first love so we can find out what that first love was and why they lost it we could tell ourselves I have to Be watchful of these I have to watch that so that we don't fall into that same condition Hebrews 610 says like this okay for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which he have showed toward his name okay we're going to take it slow so we can understand what the Scribe is saying here in the book of of of Hebrews the Apostle [Music] Paul for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward what name the name of God the name of Jesus Christ there's a comma there if if if you notice and that you have ministered to who to who to the Saints and do Minister and do Minister when God sees my labor our labor our work that we're doing it in his name we're doing it for God but the action it's for his name notice what the writer is saying here it say the labor and the work that you have done toward in his name or for his name when we do something for our brothers and and we serve the Saints we're not doing it just for them we're doing it in his name for his name we're doing it for his name sometimes we fall we fall in the the Trap we say I'm not going to help the brother why would I help the brother why do I have to love the brother remember in in who in what representation you we are doing it in because you take credit for for for my Saints for doing something for my Saints you're doing it for me it's as if you're doing it for me sir that's right serving them this is what the first uh church had where's that right right on the side there uh remember without seizing your work of faith and labor of love and patience hope in our Lord Jesus Christ the first church they understood that in serving the Brethren they were serving God that the love that they reflected to toward God was being expressed in serving the Brethren yes sir amen maybe more than I do holding forth the word of life this is that I may rejoice that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain did this scripture because how Paul says you could do something in in vain you could work for yourself isn't that right many times we could say oh I'm doing something for God but we're working for our own benefit Paul says that's a a work in vain labor in vain that's right amen we want to build our own kingdom do things for our own benefits the first church with the right mentality but we'll see later that outside leaders uh came in and they had their ownit they had their own objectives and motives they had a work they were doing because we all do something but there are times that we labor in vain we want to work for our own selfish Ambitions or our owning that God would just help us my desire is to work for the kingdom of God serve my not for my own but for the kingdom of God behold the the the kingdom is amongst us next Slide part of Revelations 2:2 says like this says and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars this comes from the seven Church ages the book it [Music] says sorry brother I I it says a work um means weariness due to to the oppression because the people of God do not work for for him in a in a work of [Music] love but they suffer for him in joy and patience they carry the the the yoke yes I like the the the quote in that book because he basically saying that the people that work for God that work for the Brethren they're not they're not they're doing it happy with patience joyfully you know there's times we can do something for someone say that again and we do it complaining Not only was the word that was saying oh I did something for someone but but but there was there was there was no complain there was a joy there was a revelation something for someone yes sir amen I help the brother I help the sister I'm I'm I'm I'm finished they had a revelation they knew what they were working for that's work of love was through Revelation and they did it joyfully and they took the the patience of that yoke that yoke of patience how tremendous these Ephesians next slide please we're finishing Paul knew that that first revelation was correct God cannot give a first revelation and then a second revelation let's continue there's a lot here in other words he's saying if if God already showed us something let's bring it down when our leader or when we understand something because that first revelation came came from was a revelation to serve others there cannot be another Revelation no no no no no Revelation going going up but revelation we all have to build on on this Foundation we cannot say this Revelation is going to change into another one God does not work in that manner that's what he's saying in the seven churches in this exposition of this book change from from one Revelation to another God does not work like that we have to build from Revelation to Revelation but we will we will build on it in the right manner if we understand one revelation we can't change it for another one very simple if he did that if he did then he would show that he had a change in thought if God in the first age found he he said oh let's [Music] serve love one another God doesn't come and change that Revelation because then God would change his thought say oh we're not in the Ephesians church anymore God requires that for us we continue with that fervent love that we continue serving yes sir amen the Ephesians knew the word as Paul had taught it they knew who their leader was Paul was their leader they had taken that word that Revelation and began to act of from that Revelation I believe God has spoken to us quite a bit behind this Pulpit through our leader and it's our responsibility continue try the best we can because I know it's difficult there are things that Paul would tell the Ephesians and they wouldn't go down so easy but they understood they understood that he was their leader and the moment the leaders is taken off the scene we see the problems that begin to occur church people of that God would not take our Candlestick let's acknowledge that in in in the ephes Ephesians Church age is a leadership and we see the love reflected let's not forget that let's not forget that as people of God we will have fault the Ephesians weren the Ephesians were not perfect the Brethren were not perfect they had their faults his person was different but at the end of the day the foundation was love and serving not mattering not mattering the the rest the rest not mattering when the Candlestick was taken off the scene the problems began to happen do you know how we take the Candlestick off take them away it's not that God's Gonna gonna take them what time said said no no brother I guy here the brother I just moved when we fail to follow leadership you are taking away the Candlestick I don't follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost I am taking away the candles I'm taking what God has has taking away what God has placed and the consequences continue afterward that God would help us that God would help me that I would not take away that I would not take away that guide to follow those steps God bless you [Applause] Brothers I'm gonna put a quote up here from the book um Church ages book if we have it begin to read it go ahead these false prophets are the Grievous wolves that Paul spoke of says once I'm gone they will try to come and claim equal Revelation but their purpose is not to help you but destroy you so brother brandham is speaking on that second verse where it says and youve tried those that say that they are Apostles and are not and you have found them to be Liars God tells us through brother random you have to be uh careful who you are following the Apostle Paul tells the Ephesian church he tells them tells the church that that first church says after me there will be Grievous wolves he's speaking about preachers about leaders people that come that come says the Lord Jesus Christ dressed as as as sheep but are Grievous wolves are you with me how would we know who is a true leader of God and who is a grievous wolf a grievous wolf just worries about filling his own stomach he doesn't come to care for the BL he doesn't come to to to help the Sheep he comes to feed himself are you with me now I want you to understand this because it is a key so that you would know if you're following a true servant of God or following someone that's just named leader you have to be careful who you're following because the person you're following will form the foundation what Foundation brother the teachings that he teaches you will build upon those teaching seed that he is sewing in you in the end they will produce something in you are you with me Brothers what type of seed are you receiving what typ of teachings are you receiving if the seat is not correct the result will will not be right you say Lord why can't I bear any fruit why I not gone to the show the perfect I live the right kind of Life what type of seed are you receiving what are they teaching you who are you following are you with me brothers are you are you following someone that is placed by the holy ghost or somebody that put themselves Place themselves that's what this age is about a true servant of God first of all he's a servant it's that simple he is a servant he is a servant a true servant of God is a servant he doesn't come to do something for himself he comes to do something for the kingdom of God and to serve the people that's why brother Alex read that [Applause] scripture how how how do you love and serving the the the Brethren the and and help and serving them are you with me now I want you to notice this because in that first age two types of leaders rose up there were those that God had placed that were the TW Apostles and then Paul the one that that took the re and then others rose up that's right the ones that heard the other other ones are the ones that will deviate they will not go to the world but they will grow alongside other Church they will continue to go Church continue being religious but just simply religious are you with me Brothers I want you to notice since the beginning God tells who are you who are you foll you follow the correct incorrect person you will end up wrong you have to be certain that you are following that God that someone God has placed someone that is there to Serve the People brother Bram continues saying says these false Apostles are the Grievous wolves Paul spoke of he said once I gone they will try to come and claim equal Revelation but their purpose is not to help you but destroy you then he reads the scripture [Applause] for I have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost had made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood now these are the instructions to the correct leaders to the correct pastors worry for the church for the feed the the Lord told pet feed my sheep take care of them love them protect them these are the leaders the Holy Ghost has placed [Applause] for says therefore watch and and remember I just read that paragraph okay it says to feed the Church of God which he had P purchased with his own blood how beautiful brother puts it like this if you had two drops of blood of the Lord Jesus Christ which he he on the cross if you could obtain them if you could obtain them and had them in your hands two little drops of the Lord Jesus Christ how would you walk how would you behave to make sure that you would not let them fall that something would happen to them you would take great care of them with all of your soul isn't that right how much more he says the purchase of his blood and now I am before the purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus you children of God brother my sister are the purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ how much more much more more Val blood of Lord Jesus or the purchase of his blood we know it's the purchas he gave us to obtain his children to buy you how should we we uh we treat our Brethren brother Bram continues speaking on the the Ephesian Church age he says for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own s shall men arise speaking perverse things he puts here in in the commas their own words and ideas their own words and ideas not God to draw away disciples after [Music] them that's what the incorrect leaders want and that Spirit should should come out of us because we're all leaders we have to be the right leaders am amen or not the the foolish virgin follows the light of the of the wise virgin and if you have a family you are a leader have children a wife women you're a leader right come on Church an incorrect leader just wants to drag away draw away disciples they want the people to to come near to them there be many around them around him come and listen to I want to tell you he want he wants them to see he wants them to see the the the the the wife husband the husband I'm the only one that's the boss here that is incorrect Brothers the Apostle Paul say love thy wives just as Christ loved the church he gave himself for her he gave himself but an incorrect leader wants the the the attention on him or or on her yes or yes continue saying says therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears and now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified continues saying John knew of them also for he said many false prophets are already gone out into the world that Antichrist Spirit was already infiltrating church and it was doing it by going against the word why here is where it all started right here in the first church age already they were denying the word and setting up their own philosophy instead of the word that is Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be anti- word is to be anti Jesus to be anti- to be Antichrist because the spirit and the word are one if you're anti- word you will have to be Antichrist and if it started in the first church it will have to grow until the end when it takes over that is exactly what you will see as we cover all the ages it starts out real small in the Ephesian [Applause] age and it grows in every age until the anti- word Antichrist system takes over entirely and the infallibility of the word is repudiated by the false Apostles of the false church I want to read the the next verse verse three verse three and four and has born has patien and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted now brother Alex read what it means to to to work for the love labor love his name what does it mean what does it mean you said amen what did he say serving the the the the Brethren of the Saints yes or yes isn't that what we read or do we need to read it again it says and has born and has patience and for my name sake has labored and has not fainted you know that's the only way to not faint is to do it for the love you have towards him if you do it without love sooner or later you will become weary you will complain you will you will let God um but if you do it for love you'll be able to withstand or bear it verse four never neveress I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love that's the complaint the complaint was that they had left their first love yes sir yes now we've repeated it many times but I want to make sure that you've understood it how do you know that you love God what does our Prophet tell us how do I know how much I love God see how much you you love your brethren are you with me brothers so when he says first love you have to connect the things together how do we know we love God how do we know we love God you see how much you love your brethren yes or yes or or is there another definition could you love a god without loving your brethren you sound like you're you're doubting maybe it's the masks can can you love God without loving your brethren you can't be heard there's no way say there's no way to love God if you don't love your brethren there's no way there's no no way so God is is telling them this first age about their leaders but he's also speaking to us he tells them if you want to know who who a true leader is you have to why they're doing what they're doing why do they serve the way they serve what is their motive we could focus on the word but the word will take us back to this oh we could say oh it's because they they have the right word if they have the right word they're correct they're the Right leader but what does it mean to have the right word what does that mean Paul said I did not come to you knowledge I came to you with the power of the Holy Ghost he reminded the people many times with how many tears I have served you remember what I did for you yes or yes the word will bring us back to this anyway the the the word will always bring you back to the right love because the all the word is is a a letter of love if you see it as as anything else you will miss the mark one day this word will would become the the the letter of judgment but for the Sons and Daughters of God the word is a letter of Love Yes or yes I'm telling on to read the message you know what I'm tell brother tells us that the Bible is a love letter and that his children his bride can read between the lines so the word will bring you back to to the right type of love the the word will not take away the love brother Bram tells us various times in this message of the Ephesian Church age when he preached it he says they had everything but they didn't have the right love they had they had the works but they didn't have the right love that will take you to the incorrect thing if you don't sew it in the right manner you you you will you will destroy it or it won't do any good from the bil brother Bram tells us the story of of of his son Billy Paul Paul the story of of brother Billy Paul he says that his daughter he was telling his his his wife you know my father says you know what he says she had closed the door and she had locked it and she answered but if you could only say it the way he says are you listening to me brother I'm about to finish you and I can focus on the word but if the the correct word not given in the right Spirit it will not bring the right thing if you just bring out the letter and try to give the letter to the people but it's not accompanied with love produce the incorrect thing in the person I know we could focus on the word apost they didn't have the right word that that is true but you can bring the right Doctrine in a bad Spirit it an antichrist that's why I'm focusing on love we could bring what brother Brown brought but we have to read between the lines you have to read between the lines you can have the right words are you listening to me with the incorrect Spirit that's why brother Bram tells us I'd rather have someone this is our Prophet tells us I'd rather have someone with the wrong Doctrine in other words with the wrong are you listening to me the doctrine is a teaching I'd rather have someone with the wrong Doctrine but with the right Spirit someone with the right teaching and the wrong spirit because if they have the sooner or later if you have the right Spirit it'll take up to the right thing is not the doctrine first the first thing is not first thing is love return to your first love oh the first love is the word of God God is teaching me the first thing is not the letter first thing is the right Spirit receive the right Spirit take you to the right Doctrine amen we want to apply the word with the wrong Spirits it will produce an antichrist when you try to show your brother and you just bring the word but don't bring it with love you don't want to help him you could kill him kill your whole family with the word you enter into the right Spirit first you have to do it with love first you have to say Lord help me to serve my brother help me to help him it hurts me to see him like that it hurts me to see her like that but I won't just bring the word I want to show them love first that they would know how much I love them brother Bram says to fill it with honey first so many people that I know in other places they have the word but they don't have the love that word is never swn right brother Bram says and testing you here but he talks about the vision that in that dream she saw the water falling and and and nothing could her it would go that that she could not get it until she put honey when she put honey she was able to hold [Applause] it says that the honey is is is brotherly love and without love that word we cannot retain it correctly we want to bring the word the teachings and brother brandom said it like that and the word says this but if we only if we just simply brought it in the same Spirit brother would go to the Pentecostals go to the Baptist anywhere he was invited and he loved them even though they did not believe the same he loved them I tried to help them now you see why the seed cannot bear fruit it was planted incorrectly the musicians can come forward I repeat we could say it's because they had the wrong Doctrine and that would be true a false teacher brings false Doctrine but I want you to notice what it says here you need to go back to your first love that is your problem we try to to uh construct our home with nothing but word but with the incorrect Spirit you will fail you will fail try to correct the brother or sister but without love with the incorrect Spirit you will fail you will grow weary you will faint sooner or later you you you want you want it to hold up you want it to grow [Music] right we need the right Spirit first we need to go back to Pentecost Pentecost is not just what happened in the upper room Pentecost is what produced return to Pentecost is not simply believe in the [Music] gifts return to Pentecost means returning do the same things that that church did what what It produced may God help us right please stand forgive me Brothers how many love them [Music] s he know say [Music] to Hallelujah say he know oh [Music] oh in know amen amen [Music] amen to S oh
