[Music] it's an honor and a privilege to be before you I want to thank my pastor for the trust that he's given each and every one of us um as a title um we've put a momentous decision a momentous decision but if I can give a little thoughts the right decision if I can give the definition of decision it's the ACT of or need for making up one's mind something you choose a choice if we can open our scriptures to Ruth chapter 1 verse 14. you know and it's just not any decision that we have to make it's the right decision we should make Ruth chapter 1 verse 14 says like this and they lifted up their voice and wept again mother-in-law by Ruth clave unto her yes and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law Andrew said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from falling after thee for whether thou goest I will go and where thou largest I will launch thy people shall be my people and thy God my God is listen closely without dyest I will die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if odd but death part thee and me um Heavenly Father Lord we give you thanks gracias Lord for giving us a privilege to be here once again Lord to be able to exalt Your Name Lord to glorify and Worship You Lord without you or nothing Lord I put myself aside and maybe you speaking through through me Lord and Lord if I make a mistake you help me Lord you stand me are you there we put all this in your hands we put the service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know in our daily lives we all always make decisions it should be moment every every day there's always a decision that has to be taken you know this is to even wake up it's a decision to get out of bed as a decision you know and and but I think it's necessary you know that we do the right decision correct the right decision with God and and this the scripture that I read you know it I believe it typifies the time and day we are today in that time there was uh scarce of food and this is you know we don't even see that many eggs anymore in the stores no no we must no November where was you know but I believe there's also a spiritual scarceness you know that that people need more you know there was Hunger in that time [Music] you know but hear the scripture shows us of a decision that someone made you know Ruth root that she made the decision to go with Naomi you know in this land uh in the land of the moabites um there was there was a a father named abimelech Naomi you know what me you know and they had children melon and Chilean Maloney and they married unto orpha and Ruth you know but the time came uh when Naomi became a widow the time came when orpha became a widow and then Ruth did as well and so we see now that they did not have a head okay you know because the Bible says is the head of the man and the man is the head of the wife yeah you know but now we're seeing that that now they're widows so they have no one to lean on to uh so now the conditions are a little bit different conditions you know it's three widows living together now and Naomi heard the news like I said they were scarce of food yeah but she heard that there was food in her Homeland is you know there was something better than where she was at at that moment yeah Ruth was um she was a moabite a gentile she was a Pagano and Naomi said it's necessary for me to go home you know you know but what about Ruth you know Ruth didn't have anyone where she was going to go you know the decision that she was going to take so she had to leave everything behind she actually family friends everything that she has you know and now so that that time came what she had to do a momentous decision in other words a crucial decision that could Define her future definition hallelujah amen we see that Naomi is her her name means placenta um uh and she changed her name Tamara which means bitterness you know everywhere that that Naomi looked you know she saw that she was surrounded by bitterness Ruth was a widow orpha was a winner and she was also widowed you know that that kind of takes me to one conclusion that the things where that the the things that we're surrounded by the people our atmosphere that we're buying you know can take us to do the wrong decisions you know so so what are you doing to not make those wrong decisions while an individual you know it doesn't have to make a decision you know there's there's there's peace I I pass you know there's there's uh Tranquility you know but when someone is has to make a decision you know that's when schools can get a little bit you know a little bit weird you know because now it's up to you to make that decision you know but what are you going to do when the times get rough it'll give us when it's good it gets hard when everything seems like it's going downhill you know in that time God is waiting for a response from you now are you going to wait upon him are you going to make the right decisions you know Hallelujah when the time comes for decisions you know we have to make sure we're anchored to God you know because it's a decision you know to follow God you know if if you don't want to that's up to you if you don't want to leave everything you know but but I believe you will you will suffer the song consequences you know but make sure you grab a hold of his promises you know he said that he would take you out you know that he would deliver you you know he would he said he promised that he would be there with you and also just believe trust in him nowadays or India we're faced with a lot of decisions a lot of a lot of decisions muchas decisions and and so Naomi said I'm gonna return home and they they all answer they said well we're not going to leave and Naomi kept insisting she said I'm going to leave and orpha kissed her and said goodbye she said in other words I don't want to make the right decision correct I don't want God to bless me you know I don't want to leave my Idols I don't want to leave what's mine you know but a child of God you know he's going to give up his rights he's going to give up everything that he owns you know it's a follow what God wants for him but here's Ruth he says no way I'm leaving you yeah where you go I'll go where you go I'll go yeah I think we can see here that that Ruth made the right decision correct the room made the decision that impacted her yeah her future now I I started to think what if Rue didn't make that decision where would that decision have taken her yeah Lori the definition of the word momentous it's of great significance or of great importance especially in its bearing on the future especially in the burying of the future you know it only takes one decision it only takes up one decision to follow God and leave everything or make the wrong decision and not end up where we should have been is Hallelujah many times we don't make the right decisions it's because we're not still working you know we're not calmos you know we don't wait on the Lord and and that's what takes us to do the decision that sometimes we regrets I want to read this quote from Brother Branham and the message Redeemer Redemption notice Ruth was willing to forsake her Idols forsake her past life forsaker people forsake everything and return with Naomi no matter what the circumstances she was willing to go on that's the way every man that comes to Christ must be first be willing [Applause] regardless regardless of the circumstances regardless of what life throws at us regardless of what what what Satan throws at us you know we should still decide and make the right decisions the decision that Ruth made led her to the right path correct you know it was not an easy decision she was human like you and me you know maybe she could have doubted you know but but she made the right decisions that God has something for him and I believe Ruth she was not forgotten but she was remembered you know who here wants to be remembered we're up there in heaven you know to remember that we did everything that we could you know for God my my dad was told me from Brother Branham I believe where he said that this man was uh in heaven is you know and he was standing before God the white Throne Blanco you know and and he said the whole sorry excuse me before the gates and his name and he said hold my name is you know Timothy Hernandez and so the angel kept looking and looking yeah and he says you know your name is not here and so he said no but look again it should be in there no I'm looking I'm looking it's not there it's not there but if you would like to present your case you know before God you know go in there so there was that man that stood before God and this is and he asked him you know you know what did you do okay well you know I brought lives to Christ I did this and then he says but have you ever stolen have you ever lied yes yes see have you ever done something you shouldn't have done yes you know but so then he saw that you know where he was heading to Eva but then he felt a touch on his shoulders you know Jesus Christ you know saying but he stood up for me he stood up for me you know he stood up for for me for me like in Earth you know when a person is LED and guided by God Persona is and keeps us calm yes you know you know God guides them you know because it's the word of God that said that says blessed are those who wait on the Lord your brothers and sisters let's make that right decision let's make that right decision to leave everything that we that we have you know and if you can't leave everything start with one thing amen [Applause] for God but I came to have church tonight's decision I don't know if I pronounced that right uh but I would like to thank God for putting the trust in me I would like to thank brother Timmy and Samuel Samuel to be able to share this Pulpit tonight with them you know we're Gathering last yesterday the other day with Isaac with uh Samuel estamos and we're ashamed what we're going to talk about is and we started talking about a crucial decision you know every day we make decisions you know and what we're going to wear you know we don't know if there's going to be a thunderstorm coming up living here in Colorado 20 means 100. you know the crucial decision on what we're gonna do that day every day in our lives we make a crucial decision whether we're going to get up and go to work or we're going to stay home and stay sleep and get fired you know but if you can turn your your your uh your scriptures to root chapter 2 verse 10 and 11. then she fell on her face and bowed herself bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have have I found Grace and die eyes and thou showed us that shouldn't take knowledge of me seeing that I am a sin I am a stranger rude foreign father and thy mother and their mother and the land that they uh David and art come into the people that that which though knowest therefore not boss ladyjo is when Naomi lost her two sons and her husband she talked to her two daughter-in-laws and she said and she said I am gonna go back to my land and those two daughter-in-laws were root and Opera I I don't know and they shall return back to their family yes so they can take care of you and also made the decision to leave she went back to worship her Idols to her God Jesus that she wanted to go back with Naomi Ruth told Naomi let your people be my people let me live where you live let me die where you die bury me where you are buried but the biggest one for me is she said let your God be my God you know at that point man and that's the moment that was a crucial decision you know to live where she was comfortable you know sometimes it's hard to live where we're comfortable every morning when it's cold you know we it's hard for us to get out of our bed is you know I can imagine that she was going to leave everything behind everything that she probably knew she was leaving it behind all those Idols all those Gods she was leaving all that behind man what did these fishing Ruth bad made to go to a different place see and she went and she worked on the fields you know to help her mother-in-law and you know and that's when Boaz saw her yeah and he saw Grace on Earth and she asked why did you see grace on me and he said because I see what you have done for thy mother-in-laws you know brother Brandon says that's where she received her Redemption see brother Branham says that Boaz represents Christ and root represents the church Boaz was Ruth's Redemption the root so how do we receive our Redemption that was when Christ died for us you know there is no other way that we could receive this you know it was so hard imagine why it's so painful to go through what Christ did but he says that will be done you know he says that will be done you know he loves us so much you know he didn't say he couldn't destroy the world at that moment but he said that will be done and it's surrendered everything and he surrendered everything so we can receive so we can be safe from our sins so we can be saved from our sicknesses see there is no sickness that can stand in your Nosotros halleluia see sometimes it's hard for us to make decisions especially when when when when it's a critical situation you know we we it's it's hard it's official you know when when you want to leave to to a different place you know you say I don't want to do this it's comfortable where I'm at it's comfortable but I believe sometimes we just need to get out of our comfort zone you know and just move around a little bit you know and and let God begin to do his work on us you're not gonna go fully um how do I say this see when when you decide to to follow God you know it's not it's not an easy way to it's when you do it you do it one step at a time I know I know it's hard to surrender everything at once you know to be honest I'm still struggling with some things I am not a perfect Christiano Perfecto you know I'm still making decisions to let go of things and sometimes it's hard you know because that's what the flesh learns because the flesh is from this Earth and I love the things you know it's not easy no it's faster that's right brother you know we have to leave all those Idols behind you know we have to just start letting them go one by one see when Ruth made the decision to leave her land to go in Naomi that was one decision you know and every time she made a decision if you made a decision a few Services back to leave something behind come to the Altar for the first time you know today you can make another decision oh you step you know when I made the decision to follow Christ there a lot of people probably laughed at me they said oh you're you're a Christian now they told me oh you're a Christian now you know oh you're a pastor oh here comes the Hallelujah you know but I didn't care what they said I made the decision and it was from my own for my own Goods it wasn't for the good you know you make a decision to wake me up every day I've been out there it's coming foreign foreign I want to read this quote and I'm going to be finishing with this yesterday the conference was said the lamb the young beautiful life a life never like that was never to be will be go ahead bro this is LA conferencia establish a life like the lamb had but now the father said are you willing is your love for your brother and great enough is your love for that sinful stinking world that you were born in is do you love them enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to take their place to Bear their sins the hardest critical death you're there it could be nothing to die to die that kind of death but him and in their confidence such a decision was made circumference until the blood dripped from his from his brows he was under a string of of the sins of the world was upon him yes and he looked into the face of the dove and said not my will be but thy will be done oh can we have that decision in our hearts can we have that decision in our hearts tonight just one step at a time um it could be a domino effect you know one thing after another you know you could leave one thing after another and maybe if you have never made that decision maybe you haven't made a decision if you want to follow God or not you haven't decided if you wanna if you want to live for the world tonight could be your night leave everything behind trust me I know it's not easy just leave everything behind one step at a time are you gonna make that crucial decision foreign [Applause] [Applause] even through the midst of our of our our flaws amen right away if you please open your Bibles to Ruth chapter 1 verses 16. when you have him please say Amen Ruth chapter 1 verse 16 to 17. laughs and it says like this these say I see and Ruth said respond and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee now for whether thou go is thy people shall be my people and thy God my God verse 17 where thou diaist will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me God are the blessings The Book of Ruth Brothers it's not just the book of History not only is it a story of love no solamentes but I believe that this book of Ruth is a book of Revelation too you see it might be a short book of just four chapters you see but there is a lot that we can capture from this book you know Ruth is one of the two books that has the name of a woman is there any brother or sister out there that can tell me the other name of the book there's Ruth and what else it's there that's right Brothers sorry Brothers I just want to make sure all of you are awake tonight in this book we can find the pilgrimage these women that we see in this book we see them walking in this path Las miramos where these women had walked through you see but there also had to be a rejection through a woman through a church because these women represented a church you see Naomi Ruth de Norfolk they represented a church you see Ruth represented the Church of the Bride representative represented the Orthodox Church which brother Branham says and mentions too but in this book we also see the rejection of a woman named orphan miramos you see brother Branham says the orpha represented the lukewarm Church the cultures like Alessia etc etc this lukewarm church is appears in the Bible too we could see in Revelations chapter 3 verse 15 to 16. you could see for yourself Brothers in the beginning of the book of Ruth I believe that we can already start to see death you see we see Naomi with their family and and Bethlehem familia in Belen but in the time that they are there you know there was a shortage of bread and wheat the comida Is So eventually they leave they leave from Bethlehem to go to the land of Moab you see and there's something that we must capture from here Brothers you see there is always a dangerous when one leaves its land there is always a danger there's always going to be problems when one leaves its land and here we can see that when Naomi and her family leave yeah from Bethlehem to Moab cuando salad they start to have problems listen but through the midst of all these problems go through it was all a plan of God you see Brothers Hermanos the prophet brother Branham said once we leave from the will of God we will see how horrible we will have to pay we will see how horrible we will have to pay you see Brothers once we leave from the will of God once we leave God's will don't think that everything will go well right because eventually the problems will come failures will come the tribulations left the land of bethlehemian they begin to have problems they begin to have failures one of the first things that happened I think I already I think everyone already knows Naomi's husband dies the second thing that happens is that the both sons of Naomi dies and here we can see Naomi yeah in a situation well she is helpless without a husband and without her sons and Naomi is left with her two daughter-in-laws gracias but the daughters are also left without husbands esposos so it seems like Naomi is left without hope is she decides to tell the daughters-in-laws to go back to their parents homes you see they tell it says here in Ruth chapter one verse 8. and Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-laws go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me this is trying to send her daughters-in-law back you see Brothers Naomi no I mean was so bitter is because of what she has been through youth Holiness when we are outside of the will of God when we think that our life we can do it on our own and not by the will of God you see that then there is no Revival it says there is no true Revival there's no Revival there is no true happiness and that's why the holy spirit is not there you see Naomi I believe in her Hearts she wanted a Revival I believe that she was looking for a great room I believe that she was looking for something spiritual Brothers Naomi found herself and the denomination with their family Naomi found herself control surrounded all these religious people Naomi and her family were there was no joy and there was no Revival in the family you see when Naomi told her daughters-in-law to go cuando no I mean she could have stayed with Naomi but there was something that was pulling her from doing that you see orpha saw the world orfa observe the land of moabster they all looked good in Los Angeles the Gods in vain the fame the farmer [Applause] meanwhile we find ourselves there will be no true revive and if there is no true Revival there is no true joy in us just look at all these religious churches just look at all these denominational churches today all these churches can hold up to a thousand people denominations there was four stages in the Journey of Ruth meanwhile she went back to Berlin you see when Naomi returns I like that she returns being the type of the Jewish church but she doesn't go alone Ruth goes with her and when they arrived to belem don't think that the people welcome them with open arms is that Ruth found herself foreign that is when the problems will come yes it is when the devil will come with this doors and many other times that is one of the biggest problems you see sometimes not only our friends are going to criticize but our family is all criticize when Ruth arrives this is what we must understand sometimes we think that in the house of God only Believers of the message go there foreign to this world because this world doesn't have happiness this world is filled with drugs this one is filled with games prostitutes and everything oh Brothers Hermanos but when we're here that is where true happiness you see Brothers Brothers said in the message leaving it on element brother Brandon said this is it is true Brothers if Satan doesn't pursue Diablo if Satan isn't pursuing you that is because he already has yourself because we are fighting had to make a decision and there we can see justification the second one is that Ruth had to go work in the fields which was sanctification the third stage was that Ruth had to rest in other words the baptism of the Holy Spirit we can it doesn't finish there you know what I mean it doesn't finish in those three stages don't just stay in the baptism of the Holy Spirit don't confirm yourself to just the baptism because we can lose ourselves but we need to keep going you see in the fourth stage we can see the marriage of Ruth and Boaz is you see when Boaz first saw Ruth the prophet says that it was love at first sight he did it Boaz didn't care what shirt well where she came from he always didn't care whether she had the Holy Spirit but she was gonna have a great journey a journey of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit eventually it was going to be an adoption because then the marriage comes foreign they were oh Brothers gracias brothers and in the same way he did it criticize us he didn't see our flies he didn't see what our weaknesses foreign [Music] preached in 1955 that's where every man has to come to his life [Music] is sometime is make a decision [Music] you have to make a choice you have to make a choice whether you was going to have an education or not you had to make a choice who was going to be your wife there has to be a decisions and choices made in life and in this and this is this may be the night that you have your final call you make your choice whom you're going to serve oh brothers who are we going to serve we can't served two masters big one tonight [Music] we can't have one foot in the world and one foreign accept this message that God has given us through our prophets don't think that everything will go smooth Brothers the devil will throw his darts you see we will be criticized too not on the outside but in the church sometimes but no matter the circumstances whether we are being criticized we're going through hard times stay with the word of God you're always the message God is here tonight you see we are in the house of God the altar is open we are in the land oh Brothers how many what a Revival tonight there is no true happiness I don't want to be there no more he's waiting for you to make your decision oh Brothers Hermanos I don't know what you may be going tonight maybe tonight you might be going through some problems maybe you'll be going through some things he is here tonight it just requires of a decision it requires the attitude do we truly want the Revival tonight he is here to open your heart so you will see something different something great in here is open Brothers amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]
