[Music] Let It Be in the body is [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Laughter] [Music] he said [Music] you're taking us [Applause] [Music] here is [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] my God he wants to speak this morning wants to speak to us is willing to listen to his voice you can open your Bibles with me first follow me to First timothyro cuatro chapter four verse 16. it's great to see everyone to serve the Lord together it's a group God decided on we would be together we will fight together and we would arrive together so we are proud Circa we're speaking on conquering ourselves and so the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself repeat save thyself there's nothing we can do to save ourselves but I don't think that's all the stories because the word of God also tells us that if doing and doing this we will save thyself that's interesting this is now follow me to Matthew chapter 16. this message is the second part of the last one I preached on denying yourself where it says take up thy cross Matthew 16 24. me again Jesus said then Jesus then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me now notice how he says for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man propheted if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul Lando and I'd like to message title my message be your own hero let us pray my only father in this moment we ask that it's your Holy Spirit moving through US lord it's not the brother next to me that needs you no is not a person not a sinner I need you more today I'm the one that's coming in need I desire you to help me into our expectations this morning foreign the I have two inside of me spiritual there's a spiritual there's a carnal man this is a man that is a war of that's how God wants it is this is the son of God deny yourself he is not saying he is saying that's all that we're carrying the man actually carries his cross himself and has taken up his cross automatically the only inch yes this is the same I don't want you to take up other things it's your own cross the man has taken up his cross has decided that he does not control his Destiny he is not in control and what he does absorbiendo suvida the cross is an interest that's completely absorbing him and be carrying other things La Cruz the it's an interference in your life too overwhelming entertained by other things if the cross is not the only thing you carry you will get it stay halfway foreign in the message questions and answers [Music] now just a moment if you want to see it I'll take you back to Bethlehem where I was born and I'll let you know how it happened back there it wasn't that he pointed them a future place if they wanted to know in other words he says um reduce foreign [Music] Jesus Christ foreign [Music] they need there is no Health without the cross are you with me I want you to understand this now the cross is more than a symbol of Torment uh nowadays we see the cross the Romans used to kill our Lord our leaders people carry a cross necklace many people don't understand what the cross means the cross for the Lord Jesus Christ was his purpose Jesus Christ it's his purpose and so yes foreign [Music] some people say my wife my husband they're my cross they're completely wrong for Jesus the cross symbolize what he came to do that's why he foreign when Judas betrayed him carried his cross daily foreign for purpose oh yeah or De La Cruz now the cross is something tough but it's our purpose I want you to not see the cross this morning like a waist pain or the Temptation you have to overcome or the person you have to bear okay I want you to see the cross as the purpose God has given you because every one of us God gave a purpose you realize your purpose of God foreign that's life whatever foreign do we flee from the cross see yes it's natural it's normal even the Lord Jesus Christ foreign foreign I don't have time to be stopping come on church now we're forgetting why we come for right why do we come to church do you come for God to give you something la Cruz the cross is it's something we despise normally with the spices because it's a humiliation so carry across is a humiliation to address like a good woman is a human being that seems like humiliation we don't like it we don't like the cross because if it was really our calling our person it won't be something easy to do is not easy I didn't call you for a picnic give your entire life be an example for the rest the young ladies Jonah did not want to know we can't blame him we're the same okay we don't want to do what God has called us for many times God has told me for something hot and you want to stay close we don't like it yes brother for something more comfortable TLC yes or yes that we're on the ship to tarshas and not towards Nineveh we're on a ship to tarshish how sad [Music] we want to avoid it very good but I could see don't wean remember this morning we look for other challenges only do your own works so you can only give me your works your leftovers forgive me so you can give me your leftovers before going and carrying our cross we attempt television we attempt social media we attempt our tarshish everything but the crosses we attempt excuses I can't do so much for you anymore that's what the Bible says they had this other and they didn't attend the call but when we find out that things are not getting better we have to come to the point where we notice when I evade my cross it's not improving my life that is falling to pieces it's not improving things worsening foreign [Music] but we see it it's heavy okay you know what makes it heavier is it's not only a wood en but your flesh has to be crucified you're a carnal man you need to crucify him on there wow foreign don't think that Jesus wants you to take up a cross with the end without anything you have to be on the cross being foreign [Music] slave man that's right no one else will do this for you it's your own cross because he said everything he could do for us come on Church don't you believe it is [Music] that's what I want you to understand Jesus Jesus can take you so far and then you need to take the daggers fire delivered the people from Egypt cover them protected them when the answer into the promised land that didn't mean God left them but he said the word continues through you continue the work continues whatever way you want to take it I will be with you tomorrow bravery desire it because we don't want to make the sacrifice very little benefit when the pastor does his job when you do your job when you said find out that Jesus is telling you take up your cross he knew what he come for what he says take up your cross do your job I want to get in this here Taki greater than Solomon is here like listeners the church needs tonight not a soft hybrid something soft and flabby like the churches just make a confession be baptized so be a Christian is self-denial Cristiano deny yourself on good days you need to take your cross sometimes when everything is and when we're depressed either way blando is cristianos today is so soft and people call themselves Christians when used to mean death to confess Christ and you had to depend on him daily [Music] for everything you had need of when we are having come to this place where we need him every day that's because we're not taking up our cross when there's a day that you said today was a good easy day to be a Christian is because you're relaxed to him because the cross leads you to him it's not easy to carry Titus moreda yeah if there's something difficult is to carry Titus moreda cuando cargo when I carry him he complains to me when I bring him by force to church he complains to me to give him the things of this world he complains to him they're complaining I imagine the one next to Jesus and save us you're making me do this God was good you wouldn't let you do that kindness is in that cross but I must do something and it's a carry myself crucify myself no one else will Pastor the pastor won't do it husband the wife will not do it yeah you must take up your own make the sacrifices with yourself says Calvary they misunderstood when they all denied him and went away foreign bring yourself down for us proposition foreign Hallelujah La Cruz the cross it's tough La Cruces mortal the cross is deadly Cruz is effective but the cross is effective the only effective thing is the cross there was no other way foreign yeah let's get foreign others has nothing to do this done for you only you know what you need to take Solutions only you know the sacrifice that must be made the others won't understand I was thinking the other day I was thinking I have it's been a couple days since I don't run he I felt a little girl to go out for a run there's some days I can't even jog he is I began to jog I didn't even run I was jogging I said I'm so heavy physics how hard is it to carry myself and I began to think I got even more tired but I kept jogging on a hill Europeans okay I believe I would have gone faster walking than how I was jogging porque one little step at a time but I thought if anyone else saw me

not gone I had phlegm my glasses were fogging and all I thought of was giving up my mind my body would say stop already my waist began to hurt if something happens but only I knew the battle that I was fighting in my mind and I said that's what the same with the Christians people don't know what you're fighting [Music] they're not putting an effort but sometimes giving one more step requires everything of you one more step forward so let's see just to sing and so God helps him he wants everything that's in US I began to hear a song I was listening to Christian music I heard a song that was saying I will carry you all the way I know I meant the Lord Jesus but in that moment God told me you need to carry yourself all the way you need to be strong if you aren't strong you won't get there foreign so I saw then I need to be my own hero for no one else will be the hero for me I need to be strong if I want this man to get there I need to be brave I need to fight against myself doing it for your own good amen please sound with me as we're closing I want to tell you be your own hero Valley do something brave for yourself Paul tells Timothy I fought a good battle but now it's your turn I can watch you this is he says take heed of thyself no one else will God is saying fight for what I've given you said to put be your own hero make yourself proud I've given you everything you
