[20:32] you know we could be in many other
[20:33] different places
[20:36] but god chose you to be here
[20:40] because we know that god has something
[20:42] for us tonight
[20:45] god's blessings
[20:49] amen if you can open your bibles to
[20:52] genesis chapter 37
[20:54] [Music]
[20:58] verse 3 when you have you may say amen
[21:08] now israel loved joseph
[21:11] more than all his children because he
[21:13] was the son of his old age and he made
[21:15] him a court of many colors
[21:26] and when his brethren saw that their
[21:28] father loved him more than all his
[21:30] brethren they hated him and could not
[21:33] speak peaceably unto him
[21:50] i want to thank god for allowing me to
[21:52] be here tonight
[21:56] and also my pastor for giving me the
[21:58] opportunity to be behind us
[22:02] now we are
[22:04] continuing the topic of joseph
[22:09] jose and through these friday services
[22:11] that have been coming up
[22:16] i believe we all have a good
[22:17] understanding of joseph's life
[22:23] and something that joseph's life
[22:27] that he has taught me
[22:31] joseph's story
[22:33] has shown me that god was always with
[22:35] joseph
[22:38] jose
[22:51] that god was with joseph from where his
[22:53] brother betrayed him
[22:57] from where his brother sold him
[23:00] and god the same way is still with us
[23:04] god has always been with us
[23:20] he's not only with us today
[23:24] he's always with us brothers
[23:27] we see our past life
[23:31] and we see what we are now
[23:32] [Music]
[23:34] and we can see through through the
[23:36] through the years that god has really
[23:37] changed us
[23:41] amen the the the subject of tonight is
[23:46] i matter to god
[24:02] he would leave
[24:16] he still wants us to go to his path
[24:22] now we see that that
[24:24] joseph was the favorite the favorite son
[24:30] joseph was loved more more than all his
[24:33] brothers
[24:36] and his brothers hated him because of
[24:38] that
[24:40] he was the youngest amongst the 12
[24:42] brothers
[24:48] saying how is my father gonna love him
[24:50] more than me
[24:53] how is he gonna love him more than more
[24:55] than me i am the oldest brother
[25:09] they hated joseph so much
[25:12] to the point where they wanted to get
[25:14] rid of him
[25:15] to the point where they wanted they
[25:17] didn't want to see him no more
[25:19] we have to understand the the the
[25:22] much anger they had
[25:26] the
[26:04] and there's a love that makes me love my
[26:07] brother
[26:23] that is what makes me love my brother
[26:25] that is what makes me appreciate my
[26:28] brothers
[26:31] in the the location in joseph's brothers
[26:41] because they might have seen the
[26:42] blessing that jose that god gave to
[26:44] joseph
[26:48] but they didn't see the blessings that
[26:50] they had they
[26:59] [Music]
[27:01] i believe that it is a blessing that we
[27:03] woke up today
[27:15] we don't know how many more services we
[27:17] have
[27:28] amen
[27:31] and god has grace towards us
[27:41] amen in the
[27:44] in the message
[27:46] talk on the word preached
[27:48] in the in the year 53.
[27:56] it says
[27:58] how
[27:59] how joseph perfect type of christ
[28:04] how he was born and admits his brothers
[28:07] hated of his brothers
[28:11] loved of his father
[28:14] court of many
[28:25] because he could see with spiritual eyes
[28:39] he really felt bad when he was sold by
[28:41] his brothers
[28:55] from the beginning to the end
[28:58] god had control over joseph
[29:01] over joseph's life
[29:04] he kept saying he could interpret dreams
[29:06] and see visions
[29:11] and they hated him
[29:13] they hated him for a just cause
[29:16] he seems in causa
[29:18] so they so did they hate jesus because
[29:21] he was a spirit because he was spiritual
[29:37] his brothers just had envy towards
[29:39] joseph
[29:41] because what god because the blessing
[29:43] that god that god gave to joseph
[29:47] but i believe that we need to take a
[29:48] look at our blessings
[29:52] because a lot
[30:07] want joseph to do better than them
[30:11] they they weren't okay
[30:14] with joseph being loved more okay
[30:21] they call them beltabus
[30:24] they they hate his church today
[30:29] those have brothers and sisters
[30:32] because because of the
[30:35] spiritual spirit of god that moves in
[30:38] the in the in the in the born-again
[30:41] believers
[30:47] brothers
[31:02] is
[31:14] because that is what god came to us
[31:18] we just have to let him take control of
[31:20] our life
[31:22] we have to allow him to to move inside
[31:25] of us
[31:28] even though
[31:29] joseph was served by by his brothers
[31:34] even though joseph felt bad because of
[31:36] his what his brothers did
[31:40] i believe that he always knew that there
[31:41] was something more for him
[32:07] joseph's life might have been falling
[32:09] apart
[32:25] even when it may seem like god is
[32:26] nowhere to be found
[32:30] he is always with us
[32:32] he always has an eye over us
[32:36] he's always taking care of us
[32:39] at all times brothers
[32:54] uh
[33:06] when things might have been falling
[33:08] apart
[33:20] that is what god is doing tonight
[33:36] at the end i i'll go i'll go when was
[33:39] that joseph and they ended up providing
[33:42] for his brothers
[33:45] not just providing for them
[33:48] for providing for the people
[34:15] but there is still someone that you can
[34:17] trust yeah
[34:32] you know i ask myself a lot of the time
[34:36] why is it so hard to believe
[34:39] why is it so hard to receive of god
[34:43] and it is because we make it hard
[34:46] because
[34:59] [Music]
[35:14] because even
[35:28] a lot of the time
[35:43] we can give sometimes our time to god
[35:48] we can give god his worship
[35:52] but we want to receive of god
[35:55] that is why we name that god is always
[35:58] with us that we matter to god
[36:02] if we matter to god you say
[36:05] you will always take care of us
[36:07] he's always been taken care of
[36:10] may god bless you
[36:15] [Applause]
[36:20] amen god bless you
[36:22] can you guys hear me
[36:27] thank you uh brother jesus for the word
[36:29] tonight amen
[36:33] the story of joseph teaches us a lot
[36:37] like he says about envy
[36:53] amen
[36:56] let's be meek and humble amen
[36:58] because that's a godly character
[37:02] that's how jesus walked on this earth
[37:07] and that's how brother branham walked on
[37:08] this earth
[37:11] because everything he did he pointed
[37:12] towards god and not himself
[37:16] you know thus says the lord
[37:20] how long will it be until you humble
[37:21] yourself
[37:25] and us says the lord
[37:28] in this you will know that i am the lord
[37:30] yes
[37:32] that i am your lord amen
[37:37] um
[37:39] there was a there's a story that i was i
[37:42] was i was recalling when when he was uh
[37:44] talking about the brothers
[38:13] you know it would be nice if you
[38:15] if you kill that ego flying up there
[38:19] orlando
[38:20] and the the hunter tells the ego
[38:24] i need feathers to reach that that that
[38:26] uh
[38:27] that um the highness that high yeah
[38:44] he shoots tira he misses ifaya and it
[38:48] contains you the ego getting more more
[38:50] feathers
[38:52] he aims
[38:54] and he misses ifaya and then another
[38:57] feather then another
[39:07] he no longer could fly because he had
[39:10] he was left with no with no feathers
[39:28] is that if you are envy if you have envy
[39:30] towards your brother
[39:33] if you have jealousy for someone else
[39:36] the only person you are hurting
[39:40] amen let's go ahead and open our bibles
[39:44] to uh the book of um
[39:48] the book of genesis
[39:50] genesis book of genesis 37 capital
[39:59] and then from there i'm going to go to
[40:00] verse 19 and 20.
[40:04] so it says like this verse 5.
[40:07] now joseph had a dream and he told it to
[40:09] his brothers and they hated him even
[40:12] more
[40:20] verse 19 and 20.
[40:23] then they said to one another look this
[40:25] streamer is coming
[40:32] tony come therefore
[40:33] let us now kill him and cast him in into
[40:36] some pit
[40:37] and we shall say some wild beasts has
[40:40] has devoured him
[40:42] we we shall see what will become of his
[40:44] dreams
[40:50] is
[41:05] so we have joseph here
[41:08] and just the background i'm sure we all
[41:10] know the story of joseph
[41:13] jose
[41:14] the second youngest
[41:17] of the brothers
[41:32] and our brothers preached about that
[41:34] though two fridays ago about the coke
[41:38] so god god god spoke to joseph through
[41:41] dreams amen
[41:46] yes amen uh how many dreams how many
[41:48] dreamers do we have
[41:50] do we have any
[41:52] just a few of us the rest i'm guessing
[41:57] nightmares you know i had a dream once
[42:00] and this was before i moved to colorado
[42:03] colorado and i i've only shared with my
[42:05] family back in cali solomon
[42:08] family in california and god is my
[42:10] witness
[42:12] because i believe god gave me that dream
[42:29] the second one the segundo it was i was
[42:31] gonna own a house
[42:34] and then the third one
[42:36] it was i was gonna have a family okay
[42:39] all before the age of 30.
[42:42] probably one of the best dreams i've
[42:43] ever had
[42:45] and i'm claiming it in the name of jesus
[42:50] and i tell god nowadays
[42:53] if you want to fulfill that dream by
[42:55] next year
[42:56] is
[43:12] the harder it gets
[43:15] your life gets tougher
[43:18] in order for your dream to come true
[43:22] you must go through nightmares
[43:38] is to discourage you
[43:42] from fulfilling fulfilling your dreams
[43:44] amen
[43:46] amen so in order to fulfill your dreams
[43:49] you have to have the holy spirit
[43:51] you can't do it alone
[44:06] do you only walk with him on fridays and
[44:08] sundays
[44:10] domingos you know you're gonna have to
[44:12] struggle before you receive the
[44:13] blessings
[44:16] it was joseph's dream
[44:19] of jose i got him into the pit
[44:24] because after joseph told his brothers
[44:29] it says in genesis 37 24.
[44:34] and they took him and cast him into a
[44:36] pit
[44:38] and the pit was empty there was no water
[44:41] in it
[44:48] agua
[44:52] that joseph was the perfect type of
[44:54] jesus christ
[44:59] not just perfect but he also says a
[45:01] beautiful type of better sounds
[45:17] i was with joseph when he was rejected
[45:19] of his brothers
[45:23] because he was spiritual and the rest of
[45:25] them were carnal
[45:26] spiritually
[45:28] i was with him
[45:30] when all the reproach he had to stand by
[45:32] his own brothers
[45:43] he
[45:44] was for we are all one in jesus christ
[45:50] i was with joseph in his cave
[45:55] i was with him when he went to the right
[45:57] hand of pharaoh
[46:37] how would you ever know that i was going
[46:39] to come to your rescue yo
[46:49] you know
[46:50] joseph kept the faith
