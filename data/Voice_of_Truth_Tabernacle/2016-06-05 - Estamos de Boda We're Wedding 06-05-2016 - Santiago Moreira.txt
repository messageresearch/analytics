========================================
[Music] welcome each one of said those that are watching us through [Music] the [Music] [Music] our [Music] believe [Music] all the [Music] beginning amen am amen [Applause] [Music] am [Music] [Music] I glor [Music] for [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in [Music] [Applause] [Music] fore [Music] [Music] foru [Music] [Applause] [Music] fore for [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallu [Music] for [Music] [Music] am [Music] speee [Music] foree [Music] goe [Music] [Applause] [Music] foree [Music] Hu of we'll be reading from verse 23 the name of the Lord morning say Amen when you have the scripture says heudes went he was there alone but the ship was now in the mid of the sea TOS with waves for the wind and in the of the night Jesus them the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the scene they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out of fear but straight Jesus spake unto them saying of good cheer it is I not afraid and and Peter answered him and said Lord if it is if it be thou me come unto on the and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the to go to Jesus there's always a but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefor this thou doubt we'll be making a small prayer father in these moments we come before your presence we recognize our position we recognize where before your bride do not allow my words to come out of me Lord and anything that comes out be for edifying Lord we place this in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may take your seats Brethren I'd like to read another scripture in first of John if You' like to follow me with your Bible or we they can put it up here 1 John 4:8 says there's no fear and love but perfect love casteth out fear I'd like to read that beginning part of Verse 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear we've been reading reading this beautiful passage in the word of God we realized that the disciples were going through a difficult situation they had not received the Holy Spirit I believe when the person hasn't received the Holy Spirit it's very hard to be guided by the same Holy Spirit now that the Holy Spirit can come upon a person or be beside a person but it's not the same when the Holy Spirit is inside a person we see that the the disciples were in the sea on a ship Jesus was praying the scripture says a great storm came came were coming in that sea we we see that when that began when the waves started when this there was a storm beginning in the sea the sea began to move they had fear now fear is an enemy of faith yes when a person begins to have fear in their heart I want us to understand that fear something that the devil has always wanted to use through ages the same thing he used a thousand years ago in the Dark Ages and past ages the devil is using the same thing today the devil has always tried to bring fear to the children of God because the devil knows that if you and I begin to have fear in us we will not be able to see clearly what God wants to do with us in this uh passage Peter dared as we said previous weeks pet daring the daring Peter watching the storm there was a moment when he didn't care what was happening around him Prophet says in the message perfect Faith he says Peter without the holy spirit in that moment he had a perfect faith when he focused on Jesus when he placed his sight on Jesus nothing mattered to him when he put his sight there he had perfect faith fath because perfect Faith the prophet speaks to us in this message you don't look around you don't look to what's happening around you don't see the circumstances around you you don't care if your if your neighbor is welcoming you you don't care if your neighbor isn't having anything Church it doesn't matter if the message isn't hitting you if a person has the correct Faith it's between them and God that's when you believe in your heart not mattering anything it's a decision in your interior and the exterior things have nothing to do when we can find that perfect Faith now Peter the prophet says there was a moment where he reached perfect faith and when he was in that atmosphere he said these words Lord if it is thou let me go to you upon the sea this calls my attention because when you're in that atmosphere of that perfect faith when you're believing in your heart you can ask for anything you want when you've gone to that situation to that place when you know that you're in harmony with God if it's in church outside of church if you're in your bedroom kneeling at your bed beside your bed when you find that Harmon or fellowship with God that Harmony between you and God you can ask for whatever you desire and God grants because it's come to to that perfect Faith it's beautiful to get there and truly you know when you haven't gotten there I realize sometimes when I'm praying and I saying Lord take care of my wife take care of my children but while I'm praying if it's in my mind you begin to have a conversation with god and the deeper you get in that relationship with God you're getting to that perfect Faith what is perfect Faith to believe God not with nothing else mattering that nothing else matters now Peter when he got to this place to that perfect Faith Like The Prophet says he said Lord if it be thou allow me to walk upon the sea Jesus qu uh answer is simple it's come come now Jesus knew that Peter was in that perfect faith I want you to understand that Peter did not have fear he did not see the waves he didn't see the the storm he saw Jesus now Peter gets off the ship and he begins walking the Bible and the message that I've seen doesn't specifically say how much time did Peter walk on the sea but the Bible says he walked upon on the sea I want you to understand that Peter walked upon the sea when Peter was in that perfect harmony with God his sight put on Jesus he walked on water Brethren the problem was when he stopped looking at Jesus but the Bible says seeing the boisterous wind there was a moment when Peter stop seeing Jesus he took his side off Jesus and he saw the condition he was in what a terrible problem that is because when I have my side put on Jesus I feel Invincible I don't know about you brother and sister but when you've connected in the Channel with God you can feel like you can do anything you can create your own atmosphere you can claim your healing you can claim your deliverance you can say I can do anything because you're in harmony with God but the problem is when we see our circumstances I feel skinny until I see myself in the mirror has that not happened to you yes I I I feel slim and I jump when I'm playing volleyball I feel Slim [Music] nothing matters to me and this is not a joke because we're in the Pulpit but I want you to understand what I'm saying while we're speaking nothing's good for us it's not good for us to preach a sermon if you're not understanding so there's occasions where we feel a certain way but when I come to that mirror and I say well reality is different Peter when he had his side put on Jesus he walked upon the sea brother and this morning you can walk upon the sea put your sight on Jesus now he begins to see the circumstances around him and automatically brethren he begins to sink because when we begin to see our own condition sometimes our condition is sad sometimes when you see your sickness and you say I'm still sick that affects many times but so you can receive your healing when we see our circumstances around us now I'd like to read a little of what the prophet speaks of Faith so I was reading this message and something that came to my mind was this Lord why do we sometimes lose lose the substance like the prophet said because what the prophet says is that Peter there lost the substance of faith and we were saying in previous weeks that when you lose the substance I believe I believe I believe there's no substance in what you're saying the wind takes your words okay but the prophet speaks to us and says speaking of faith faith and love are family members because one cannot have faith unless they have [Music] love this CS my attention what the prophet is saying the prophet continues saying because because your faith is in God who is the essence of love Faith and love work together this caus my attention because sometimes I see Faith here like the first step of the pyramid and sometimes I see love all the way up here and when I am in faith and I look up I see God's perfect love High very high I see his love higher and I say I will never get there sometimes I'm barely trying to trust has that not happened to you it be if you're Faith virtue or patience but there's a few words that the Bible says that I enjoy a lot and sometimes I say them very often and it's this that says he that began the work will Perfection the work in us it's God who's taking us brother it's God responsible if he began something in you and I he will finish the work that began in us I give God I give thanks to the Lord for because I say Lord I'm in your hands and it depending on you where do you want to take me to and I believe God wants to take us to Perfection look you have to have faith and if you put one to the north and one to the South when you put Faith North and and love at your South and that love beats one for the other it doesn't matter where they are here the prophet makes an example of a couple that's in love they can have distance between each other but that love is beating in them I'm closing with this Brethren you never SE for God no man can come to me if the father does not bring you and God came to that worldliness what you were and he seek for you and he brought you out this is God's love for us brotherr this is God doing this for us that should make a perfect love see what you were and look at where you are now now there Brethren that should cause something in you to see where I was and to see where I am now the love that God had for us to come down to world and to bring us out of that riness and put us in Heavenly places hallelujah hallelu what did that do what did that do says the prophet someone that loved you then how can you not have faith and what he has promised you the genuine love and true love will make trust will create trust when you falling in love with God when you realize what he's done for you eternal love I've loved you says the Bible when you realize of that love what has that love done for you the prophet of God says the true genuine love trust in his word hallelujah hallelujah that love that that we're having that we're falling in love with with God will create trust to his word now when I have a doubt or when doubts come to me let's remember of God's love what God has done for us with how much love has he loved us and that should create trust towards his word to say Lord what you've done for me is nothing in vain so I will believe you not mattering anything you loved me I'm loving you and that love I will deposit my trust on that love where you take me on mountains in the valley I will continue loving you Lord because you love me first bless be the name of Lord God bless [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

and [Music] evil and the Lord God said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil in the scripture I see God and Sayan being in agreement God and saying are agreeing but I don't want

wedding amen amen I am wedding Brethren hallelujah hallelujah we're wedding do you believe that we're wedding glory to God we're we're already wedding brother she is preparing herself amen I was reading a story of Israel and I'd like to tell it hopefully someone's benefit when there is a wedding in Israel with the Jews the father of the young man would go to the other family to ask for the one for the young lady and they made a [Music] treaty first to Eng themselves but they signed a paper the father of the young man would give the young woman find linen so since that moment she can begin to Perfection her dress the young man would leave to his house and he would begin to build his house his Mansion where he would take his bride look there isn't time to explain this I wish you I could have had more time look in my family something happened my first my first brother that got married the young lady's parents went to my to my house because they didn't want her living with us they said I want them to go live somewhere else and have their own house that's what happened with my older brother he built his house before being married it's true that's why I was getting excited and when my brother was married he took his bride to his home nor to the father's home but both of them alone amen hopefully you can apply it if there's young men here use when you think of getting married work hard prepare your house do not take your wife to your family members she is your bride the mo the thing you love the most what you want the most take her to your house amen amen hallelujah Ministries are to edify to Perfection it the Ministries that's true parents that have daughters this is true and I have daughters and I'm glad Fidel is here and he's a hard worker well I I'd let loose a little Candi is the greatest with me at my house and at church and that man who looks at her first must have a home must first have a home I'm saying I'm saying it if or else she's not leaving unless she wants to do it in her way but a father desires the best for her children our heavenly father you the best amen it's true you know I like to be realistic and what I say what I say is true amenu amen because the church is growing I was not born in the message I was born in a Catholic home I'm just saying something because I don't know if I return here at my age I don't know but that it stays here he said something that's true a father wants the best for her for his children I want the best for my children love your wives God demands of the man to love his wife not that the woman loves him we're an expectation right you can fix it however you want but that she's obedient men love your wives it doesn't say wives love it says wives oby because you're obeying Christ I'm saying a Christian husband a husband that loves God a husband that has the wordu pleasing wants pleasing who can do it who whoever can do it she is the bride Hallelujah the first verses I read God and S are in one Accord right Jesus and Jud ACC the time has come go give me up they they're walking parallel look at seek Through the Bible but what caus my [Music] attention say said you know you will be like him amen but the Lord says behold they are now like us they know good and evil amen we know good and evil right we're like God God is so good it's true I know good and evil I know between good and evil we are like God Amen because it is written God knows between good and evil and we know between good and evil brother Bram says the bride he says in the message choosing a bride he says she will be like him she will be like himu she is like him brother this is the bride the true bride the real bride she is like him I believe like this I'm a legalist realist I'm realistic I did not know this message before but when the message came to my life something happened I've uh put together many songs I sing I used to sing nice songs but now I say if this is a new life let's begin to sing songs and I'm fixing songs because message changed me it transformed me took me to a higher level it's the truth this message sent from heaven for the bride for the seed it transforms you it changes you it transforms us who believes it who takes it truly who eats it it changes you it's different your faith is different everything is different look to only believe it from your heart although we already know you were predestinated to believe it you already came pre-order to believe it we are forn to believe it many will read it the prophet said you can say you read the message and that you believe it he says obey it oh I read the message I speak with a lot of people and say I want to go and listen and I believe in Christ I believe in God I said you're as Satan just believing is that right oh I believe in God I Believe In Christ they're in my house I read it I say you're just like him this message for truly Brethren it transforms if you believe it but I understand I I'll be 40 in I'll have 40 years in September pre preaching the gospel but my conviction for 40 years in September remember I always make three services if it's with three or four people I glad it changed me I preach in the name and the trity but I still needed something else I wasn't complete sometimes you don't feel like you just eat a little bit and and you you stay empty you need more that's how we were it's true we want more we couldn't understand but the Revelation came the message came the message came has transformed us we're natural we we are also Supernatural Hallelujah and what that means to say we are Supernatural because we are above all nature you see a new vehicle it's fine you see a building you say it's fine but you're above all of that we're above Earthly things God blesses but your heart isn't there you're not from here we're at wedding brother and he comes the the great supper is coming we're in a true expectation we don't know what time but something is happening he's transforming us every day I feel that he's transforming me for 40 years in September you're invited Hallelujah but he's transforming [Music] me I feel like I'm just beginning to walk with God something is happening I hate myself because I know that Santio is evil yes you no Jesus said to hate ourselves hate your own life your own desire your own thoughts the man is Earthly he does not understand he can't understand but God sent us a powerful message to understand and to receive and be different and I've say to the Lord something's happening so I say Lord I must deny myself I would like to stay somewhere in the the mountain by myself but God is just always putting people there to follow me maybe for a punishment maybe maybe to take care of myself yes I love this message I love his word and something is happening I have to reject this man he wants the Earthly he wants to be good he wants to enjoy everything but the one on the inside he wants to see Christ he is in glory he wants a spiritual man he understands Paul said the natural man truly does not understand and this is the truth and when I understand myself I can understand you just like I struggle you struggle just like I fight you're fighting all of us all of us but without a battle there isn't a crown there's no Victory sometimes God allows us to struggle God allows all of that and he's transforming me let me tell you I've been wanting to have a wife and my desires to bring out this message and you that have wives that are of the message bring out all that love that love of Christ that uh comfort that help encourage your wife she is human like you amen but I want to reject myself I want to reject myself I know who I am you know who you are you know who you are I still know who I am but something is happening this message is making me come higher and I say no I'm going to quit to everything and I'm going to follow God maybe I can help someone someday there's so much need Hallelujah and for love so that se that's in the four corners of the earth I have to I have to reject myself you as well amen hallelujah and not anybody can get there but this power is taking you there amen this power the Lord called you you haven't done anything it's [Music] him although he says he's given to you but it's him I said the other day 40 years and I don't know how I got here the Lord the Lord rebed me the Lord rebuked me and said you know how you got here I've been walking with you if we know that he walks with us amen he walks with us and that's the reason why we've gone this far and the of ration given look at the story of Israel so that young lady of a fine linen was given to her to fix her dress and here itself to her has been granted to have white linen but what I enjoy is let us be glad and rejoice let us be glad and rejoice Hallelujah and give honor to him thanks to him he knows how he's taking us I want to fix the story here that brother brandham [Music] told when that millionaire man said said to his Steward I will send my son I'm going to send my son to that little town preparing everything and the man from there had two young [Music] daughters and and both of are said let's fix ourselves to see who conquers him it's fine it's natural but brother Brandon brought this story and the stories in the message and I've always enjoyed that story and time went by and they couldn't conquer him before three days before he left he went to the kitchen and there was a woman there barefoot she he said young lady and he said I'm talking to you and she looked up she said I'm only a servant here a servant there they are they're beautiful put her head down and he said woman I'm talking to you look at me the month that I've been here I've put my eyes on you Hallelujah I will give you something and I'll come for you in a year BR it's true it's true I'll come for you in one year and she took and kept what he gave to her and from that moment she was [Music] happy huj say glory to God hallelujah AMU she was laughing and jumping and dancing and those young ladies up there said my little cousin she was sick she got sick to see that handsome man she stayed crazy she would continue running she continue praising God she continues Walking with God she doesn't care about anything she continues enjoying she continues having Joy it doesn't matter if they call her foolish or if they call her poor continue having Joy hallu and they would come and ask her what happened she would say oh he's coming for me he's coming for me and the first month went by and the and the last month came and the weekend the days until the moment came brother brandham says the bridegroom came and she went to his hearts took her to the best places of Chicago or Washington amen he has promised he has promised to come for his bride he has promised to come for her amenu you just believe him not all of us will understand I don't understand Hall of he gives me something because I have a humble Ministry that I can but just believe him Hallelujah the natural they believe right there's some that you can tell them or you leave with me and at midnight they will go out with you because she believes in him she's not afraid she does not have fear like the from the suay school perfect love casteth out fear because she believes in him because if our Earthly young lady believes in our Earthly man how much more the true prde is waiting Hallelujah on the [Applause] bridegroom I'm going to read quickly let me read quickly hallu I'd like to read I enjoy what brother Brenham says hallelujah I'd like to KN scripture very well there your loving Pastor has preached to you and we know there will be a bride and there will be a in heaven it's so sure this will happen happen if it if God exist amen brotherr because it's his word and we know those who will make up that bride will be the church and they will present themselves to him with no blemish or wrinkle and they have the material remember what they gave to the young lady now above the upon the Earth to prepare herself she has made herself [Music] ready Minister are to perfection to guide you but she prepared herself if the Lord take away of lying of beding that depends on [Music] youu depends of me brethren because not it doesn't depend on God because God's given to you but that depends on you you must also have to do something who overcome all those who overcome you have power to overcome you have to be will to leave that she has prepared herself I love this word God could not force it through a small Chanel and bring to the other end say blessed be God who [Music] overcame you would not have anything to overcome there because he did it for you what are you going to glorify you would have he simply pushed you must also take your own decisions I have to take my decisions to do this I will show my faith and respect to God listen to this this is the expectation I can't explain it but everything is in church for you there's nothing outside everything is inside for youth for young men woman man and woman everything is in everything is in here hallelujah the bride understands everything all the material has been given to the bride he's given everything it's all up to you and God is doing something in my lifeu I'm learning to not blame anyone there's Candi and Sami who I'm with I'm encouraging them until they can fly because they will fly but there we don't discuss anything if candy has I have and if I have candy has she's studying maybe I I'll go rob a bank so I can help her a father a father does a mother does everything because this will be a teaching for them and if she has I have she takes care of me glory to God hallelu so I say we don't discuss anything let's not discuss let's not argue that makes people sick that gives them [Music] cancer everything's in the Bible in the great Antichrist explaining it's in the Bible what a man SS he according to if they say if you do well you receive well but I want to do right because the Bible says right everything you've have is brought has been brought out of the word if you do wrong you receive what you s you reap but from now on because you make mistakes mistakes not Sins Not sins there is no sin for sin doesn't exist but mistakes the greatest believe the word the message the truth the Revelation the messenger that's the sin that's the sin of the soul but you make many mistakes but let's begin as Christians truly I want to do it I want to practice it I want to do it I want to begin and do what's right and if I do what's right you're you're healed [Music] here it's true it's too much message I feel sorry for the creatures my father said the wise the wise two signs and the other one to he changing my life Brethren this message is so powerful that it's changing wanted to change I wanted to transform [Music] me but I must eat it eat it you're in expectation you know what you should be doing you know brother sister Patricia when she had cancer she had four years that she had not talked to me and she said if you called me you wouldn't have cancer I took her a message and I said eat it and there she's still living [Music] eat it eat it if you e it it will transform you it will transform you continua I have four months that I have not been exercising because I have issues in my knees but the food that I will transform me spiritually If the message of the word it will transform us it will change us this message is so great and powerful I'm going to do something and I'm realistic know and I'm realistic and I'm from a ranch I did not go but there's something that he done in my life and I'm thankful I would like this message is the holy spirit this message the gives this message is full of of sweetness of Truth this true dimension of power of the Holy Spirit do you know what why does why do you think the says the bride doesn't have sin because he loves her so much now treating there he loves her so much brother Bram says she doesn't know he doesn't know if she if she did something he doesn't know you didn't do anything was just accused she can't understand when you love a person it's the best person your children are the best I told Titus one day he went to Watsonville he we were eating I said I said Son continue studying I said we were eating and I said you know what candy everybody who was there he said I said I have a notebook with your mistakes he does not have a notebook of my mistakes because I believe it because he loves me and he's made me believe what father is writing the mistakes of her children or what mother maybe there are some but I don't have because I love my children so much I don't want anybody to harm them or hurt them they'll make me angry behave they they matter to me while I'm living there's a prayer for them that's how parents are yes or no because we love them and we cry with them we suffer with them we are sleep deprived with them glory to God and the more you suffer the more you loveu and this word is true for me there's nothing they're the best all of them my daughters they stand up for me I know they love me I know they love me but I'm just barely getting to my point if there's a person here do it that truly I would do it if there would be a person here that feels WR with me that I've caused harm that I harmed them that I did a wrong to them I would ask for [Music] forgiveness I would ask for forgiveness to my son Titus I've scolded him and punished him because as a father you as your baby babies always is that true or not is that true or not they were already married and mothers already still I love [Music] you this love is so great do you know what brothers and sisters know one day they gave to one day they did something for and I remember how the prophet says remember of the good that did to you and I bless the sister I love them all of them there someone I I ask for forgiveness know what love is greater this M is so I can transform you it's able to transform you is that true or not there is no hate there's love the perfect love covers a multitude of mistakes amen it's true there isn't right Hallelujah one day you did it good for me maybe one day I will do a good deed for you but do you see what this message is doing truly Titus for me if someone cost me 20 years of preaching it was was God I said no one was saved there was no one because he's blind there's Titus your son Let's Go an Applause to Christ Hallelujah this message has power but eat it eat [Applause] it truly brother you said I don't know when I'll return maybe I'll never return I never know but I'm happy with Christ I'm happy with himu with this mall it changed me that's why I'm I'm composing songs from the message I don't want to read anymore I'm good Hallelujah let me tell you there's a song and I composed it when I was going through a hard time but we're all going through tribulation and I composed that song this song also makes sense how many times have you felt hurt I feel like an injured Soldier but God [Music] allows I'm the one who makes a w and my hands will fix it but there's times when I feel like your soldier soldier and always because many people like that song went through tribulations God I preach to God he's taking care of me he loves he's loved me he sent an American to take care of me and to the year he said I'm leaving you already did the job leave hallu an American man came God has done great things God has done great things I'm strange I'm the friend of anybody who likes to be my friend if I pass by there I'll shout you I can cook for you we have a coffee together but I feel myself I feel strange I like to be alone right now Titus sent me to the basement there but I wanted to be alone there alone there I cry I preach this message preaching this message last night I cried and I don't cry sad I cry of happiness I enjoy being alone with God beautiful to God and I'm still there and I don't know what can happen I'm strange and I so like to travel some places maybe when I'm older that's how much it cost to bur me here and that's if I'm around here somewhere else they can bury me there that's how much it cost to be burried here okay God is preparing everything God allows everything and I tell you this because I want to go out to Sal I have invitations to go and I do it from my heart what I've said is true first I first I eat it so I can preach it to you I know the prophet said you must do it God won't do it for you he already did his part for you in the world you have afflictions but trust in me you trust in Lord do everything in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and in the name of Lord Jesus Christ do it already he said you have to fight your own trial but in my name trust in me that overcame mine now you have to overcome your trials and feel like a strong blessed Christian this is true and the you have afflictions and problems listen me that I've overcame the world but you have to fight is that true or not you have to fight I fight my own I fight my own battles and I enjoy it and then I say thank you Lord because I know you helped meu may this message not be in vain that truly someone eat it by little pieces God pleases in that so much message so much sermon with your throat hurting we don't need that a little by it's good for you be able to I have to do I have I have to despise myself to deny myself yes I'm wants to have the best no no no I have to deny myself there's nothing in the world only problems they say now Sal who is married Gets behind love God and God will give you everything I want to give myself more to this great power I love the supernatural I love what's Supernatural hallelu God has given me the gift to see things 2,000 3,000 miles away in the day because I love him because I believe the prophet did it but since I was a toddler God gave me a gift and it's been fulfilled it's true once you heard Brother Carlos said told me and told me and told me and I didn't tell him I remember I said Titus you're in Fremont but you'll be taken away from there in one occasion I saw an accident that he had and then I saw it again I didn't want to tell him I called him Titus you're going to go through an accident take care and yes he went through an accident a man you to be tried the prophet lik to try it you know a little bit God gives you a little bit so the people TR you a little so like I said I love what super and I want to stand an expectation maybe there's something for me I'm not a Republican or Democrat I don't care God puts Kings and takes Kings away and when you lean to someone who loses or wins I don't belong to them it's true I don't I don't have interest I don't care who who's who's President God will put him God Tak he the prophet said you're not from [Music] hereu we have too much message too much word this is the material that God gave to the bride right now there's a preacher in Salvador he's been preaching 10 years between the something happened I read the message I left message I said the Lord will reveal it to you he called me and he said I want to go to us to study this message over there I don't want want to work I want to go study for three months and come and preach he he does homes he's 40 something years old he's going to sell lant come let's pray for him God knows that gives me joy and if he com come he wants to study three or four months and then take off he said because there's nothing in this world there's nothing and then for the rest of my life I'll give it to God things are happening I'm going to sing that song brother God has allowed me to be nothing to do something the people say what are you a pastor a preacher I'm nothing I just testify if
