[47:47] Earth you find the word
[47:50] created in verse one Genesis
[47:54] 1:1
[47:57] and God created the heavens and the
[47:58] Earth okay all
[48:01] right the prophet speaks to
[48:06] us of verse one and verse
[48:11] two something happened
[48:15] there because when God creates
[48:19] something God does not create something
[48:21] out of
[48:24] order God doesn't create something with
[48:29] void when God creates something he
[48:31] creates it
[48:35] perfect if you meditate in Genesis 1
[48:42] 126 when the Bible says let us make man
[48:45] unto our
[48:46] image and
[48:50] likeness the prophet says that that
[48:53] man was perfect
[48:57] was
[49:01] perfect there were no mistakes in this
[49:05] man there wasn't darkness in this
[49:08] man there weren Shadows on this
[49:12] man this man of genesis:
[49:17] 126 was made to the image of
[49:21] God
[49:24] now we've spoke or I've began to
[49:28] speak of
[49:32] light light
[49:35] bre how we said the past the previous
[49:38] time it's very
[49:41] important the light
[49:43] brother in our
[49:46] lives in the
[49:49] beginning God created the heavens and
[49:51] the
[49:52] Earth but in verse two brethren
[49:56] we see that this
[49:58] Earth is in
[50:01] disorder and
[50:03] void Amen
[50:06] brother I have to put a
[50:09] foundation because it's fine to scream
[50:11] and worship God but I want you to catch
[50:16] something I want it's important C how
[50:19] it's
[50:21] flowing so it makes sense in your
[50:24] heart
[50:28] the prophet says a preaching can make a
[50:30] sinner
[50:33] repent teaching places a
[50:37] Christian we want to place the children
[50:39] of God who are you am
[50:44] I and if I can tell you this
[50:46] morning if you are a son of
[50:49] God you have a supernatural
[50:53] life just like the prophet had
[50:56] like the Lord
[50:59] Jesus Supernatural
[51:02] light every son and daughter of God amen
[51:10] amen can I
[51:12] continue
[51:15] okay are we good till
[51:19] now in verse three hear
[51:22] me God says let there be light
[51:26] and there was light says the Bible
[51:30] okay I've taught
[51:33] you we've been taught that
[51:36] when or When God
[51:39] says let there be
[51:44] light the prophet says there the logos
[51:47] came out of God
[51:54] okay the word of God came
[51:58] out if I can say between
[52:01] words I have not started my
[52:04] message but if I can say it in
[52:07] parenthesis God's
[52:10] word always brings
[52:13] light always brings
[52:16] light now hear me what I'm about to say
[52:19] it brings
[52:23] light when the word is for your
[52:27] hear me
[52:32] right you cannot feed yourself or or
[52:34] shine a light on
[52:37] yourself from another
[52:39] light from an old light the light of
[52:44] yesterday it's not good for the light of
[52:48] today you need to
[52:51] live in the light of the
[52:54] day the light of
[52:58] today that
[53:02] light the one who that brings light to
[53:04] your
[53:05] life one who brings light to your
[53:10] heart it brings light to a dark
[53:16] life I used to have a a dark
[53:20] life I was in churches I would
[53:24] preach I believed I felt the Holy Spirit
[53:28] I felt
[53:29] it I would fall in this
[53:33] flesh but my soul was
[53:35] [Music]
[53:41] dark but one day a light shined on my
[53:45] heart that went and spoke to me and
[53:49] said there is a
[53:53] light before the foundation of
[53:57] that had been deposited in
[53:59] you and now you can
[54:01] shine and give
[54:03] life that is why a Son of
[54:06] God when he walks in a dark
[54:09] place that place turns into
[54:12] light because the Son of
[54:15] God light to
[54:19] humanity it brings life to this Eden of
[54:24] Satan are you understanding me
[54:28] Hallelujah we are light okay I have to
[54:36] teach because if not for your
[54:40] worship because in
[54:44] denominations someone jumps and we all
[54:46] start brother Ronnie
[54:49] knows he came out of a great
[54:53] church there you come in a church
[54:57] no here we enter like if we're attending
[54:59] a
[55:01] funeral the the the songs begin and you
[55:03] start
[55:05] turning but there isn't life
[55:09] there because the light is
[55:11] in this day hallelujah
[55:15] hallelujah is is that right brother
[55:19] cor
[55:24] yes knows
[55:26] too I know we all
[55:29] [Music]
[55:32] know but that there's a substance in
[55:34] what we're speaking okay listen to
[55:42] me
[55:47] Hallelujah continue praising the word of
[55:49] the the name of the
[55:53] Lord the first thing that that was
[55:55] created in the
[55:58] creation was the
[56:06] light the last thing that was created
[56:09] was the
[56:10] man I want you to see
[56:14] this the the prophet says the first
[56:17] thing that was
[56:18] created was the
[56:21] light the light of the word of God loose
[56:25] the word of God is
[56:30] light but it has to be in your right
[56:34] fulfilling
[56:38] why because I cannot apply
[56:41] what life in my life that was back
[56:45] then that light shined
[56:48] there that line Shin
[56:51] there I need the light of today
[56:55] as our brother said
[56:57] now
[57:01] okay the first thing that was created
[57:04] was the
[57:05] light after the
[57:09] light we knew we know the first man
[57:13] came Genesis
[57:17] 126 for them who like to note
[57:23] down Christian has to bring bring three
[57:25] things to
[57:30] church Genesis 1:26 God creates the
[57:33] first
[57:35] man and the first man says the
[57:38] Bible created to the image and likeness
[57:40] of
[57:41] God what is
[57:43] God what is
[57:46] God what is
[57:48] God God is
[57:51] Spirit can we agree that God is
[57:56] says
[57:57] God is a
[58:00] Spirit Worship in spirit and
[58:03] truth it's necessary to be
[58:07] worshiped the first man was a spirit we
[58:12] know but here the prophet says that the
[58:15] last
[58:16] creation was the
[58:19] man the man on this
[58:22] Earth the man was formed
[58:28] we know that the man of Genesis
[58:30] 126 was created
[58:34] Spirit but Genesis
[58:38] 2:7 we know that the Bible says that God
[58:41] formed another
[58:45] man a man of the
[58:51] earth good right it's just a message
[58:54] okay
[58:58] the thing here
[59:01] is how to connect this first
[59:05] light with this with the man of Genesis
[59:11] 2:7 because this light and this
[59:14] man have to be
[59:17] United
[59:20] you have to unite to that first
[59:23] light
[59:25] that light
[59:26] created what came out of
[59:30] God has to unite to you you that are
[59:36] dust you that were formed Out of the
[59:39] Dust this light has to unite to
[59:43] you so it can cause
[59:46] something are we
[59:49] good okay all
[59:52] right let's continue onward
[59:58] in Isaiah 65:1 17 see what the Bible
[1:00:04] says remember that my thought is a new
[1:00:23] creation for behold I create new heavens
[1:00:26] and a new Earth and the former shall not
[1:00:28] be remembered nor come into
[1:00:33] mind the Bible speaks to us of a new
[1:00:40] creation Peter spoke to us of a new
[1:00:46] creation Isaiah spoke to us of a new
[1:00:51] creation John spoke to us of a new Earth
[1:00:54] and a new new
[1:00:58] heaven that in Genesis
[1:01:01] 1 God made everything perfect
[1:01:05] there the devil got his hands
[1:01:08] in the devil gets his hands
[1:01:14] in and when the devil was when his
[1:01:17] throne was taken away from heaven where
[1:01:19] was the devil in
[1:01:23] heaven
[1:01:25] and Revelation says a battle in
[1:01:29] heaven we know the Bible right
[1:01:34] okay his throne was his throne was taken
[1:01:36] down to the
[1:01:38] Earth and when he got here to the
[1:01:44] Earth his process
[1:01:47] began to also make an Eden of
[1:01:53] Satan and Eden where he would receive
[1:01:58] worship remember what the devil wants
[1:02:00] more is
[1:02:02] worship why because
[1:02:06] God he is the only true
[1:02:09] God and the one who should be
[1:02:13] worshiped here we worship the almighty
[1:02:16] God we don't worship anything
[1:02:20] else my glory my strength and my
[1:02:23] honor for the only true
[1:02:26] God I hope we're all agreeing
[1:02:32] here so the devil begins his Eden as our
[1:02:35] Pastor
[1:02:36] said we know there was the
[1:02:41] fall and then the process of his Eden
[1:02:45] begins we heard of our
[1:02:49] pastor that it took the devil 6,000
[1:02:53] years to make his
[1:02:56] creation to make his
[1:02:59] Eden are you following
[1:03:03] me now you and I are found
[1:03:06] here here we
[1:03:08] are you
[1:03:11] live in
[1:03:14] Earth in the Eden of
[1:03:19] Satan you don't have to believe
[1:03:22] it I'm not here for for people to
[1:03:28] believe if you believe God's word you'll
[1:03:31] believe what we're
[1:03:34] saying the word has to give testimony
[1:03:37] that we're speaking the
[1:03:39] truth this is the Eden of
[1:03:43] Satan the devil in
[1:03:48] infiltrated and that first creation of
[1:03:50] God
[1:03:53] okay he began to get his Filthy Hands in
[1:04:01] Hallelujah Eden of Sayan as our Pastor
[1:04:05] said the question here
[1:04:08] is what do I have to
[1:04:11] do how will the bride
[1:04:14] fight what do you and I have to
[1:04:18] do as Believers of this
[1:04:23] message Christians that we supposedly
[1:04:25] say we are and I believe we are
[1:04:28] Christians I'd like to read a quote from
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:34] prophet see what the prophet
[1:04:37] says how the devil
[1:04:40] began to make this world his
[1:04:47] Eden speaking of this
[1:04:53] Earth
[1:04:56] the prophet will explain what's
[1:05:00] happening
[1:05:03] only it's just the
[1:05:07] atmospheres that are around it
[1:05:11] okay let's analyze
[1:05:15] this they are only the
[1:05:18] atmospheres the
[1:05:20] devil very
[1:05:23] wisely
[1:05:26] came and began to work with the
[1:05:29] atmospheres of this
[1:05:31] Earth hear me
[1:05:35] right he began to work with the
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:40] atmospheres and the sin that is upon the
[1:05:44] Earth we know that there is
[1:05:46] sin there's sin in this world okay all
[1:05:51] right God
[1:05:57] wants to create a new creation am
[1:06:01] amen God wants to do something and he
[1:06:06] will there is a millennium where you'll
[1:06:08] be able to
[1:06:09] live a thousand
[1:06:13] years but follow me this morning don't
[1:06:16] get
[1:06:19] lost so the prophet begins to
[1:06:22] speak of this new
[1:06:27] creation and the prophet says there are
[1:06:29] only the atmospheres
[1:06:32] around and the sin that is upon the
[1:06:36] Earth the one who who will be destroyed
[1:06:39] the ones who will be
[1:06:42] destroyed now in our mind we
[1:06:47] think that because God will create a new
[1:06:49] Heaven and a new
[1:06:52] Earth sometimes we have the concept
[1:06:56] concept that God will destroy this one
[1:06:59] this Earth totally completely
[1:07:03] completely that there will be a atomic
[1:07:06] bombs
[1:07:08] nukes and will dissolve this entire
[1:07:12] planet
[1:07:15] Earth we're learning and understanding
[1:07:17] that God is not going to do
[1:07:21] that God does not destroy his first
[1:07:23] creation
[1:07:26] God does not destroy his first
[1:07:29] creation that is why if you were created
[1:07:31] in the first
[1:07:33] creation you will not be
[1:07:36] destroyed that will live and
[1:07:39] Rule upon this
[1:07:42] Earth let's continue there's a lot to be
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:52] said
[1:07:55] now we notice that in heaven means that
[1:07:57] the atmospheres are
[1:07:59] above
[1:08:02] okay so we're speaking
[1:08:07] Brethren that God will bring a new
[1:08:14] creation but he will not destroy this
[1:08:16] first Earth or first
[1:08:20] creation but it will be an
[1:08:22] annihilation
[1:08:26] all the atmospheres in this
[1:08:28] Earth because brother let's be
[1:08:32] real the atmospheres of this
[1:08:36] Earth anoint us almost every day yes or
[1:08:43] no the atmospheres in which we
[1:08:47] live anoints it almost every
[1:08:51] day come to church tired
[1:08:55] the Breen is
[1:08:59] crawling come to church the husband
[1:09:01] fighting with the wife or the
[1:09:03] wife there are
[1:09:06] problems there
[1:09:09] difficulties
[1:09:11] headaches I can't bear this
[1:09:16] body those are the atmospheres you and I
[1:09:19] live
[1:09:22] under see
[1:09:24] yes
[1:09:25] brother am are there wit is there any
[1:09:27] Witnesses
[1:09:29] here yes
[1:09:36] right but God wants to
[1:09:40] create a new
[1:09:43] creation God wants to cleanse this
[1:09:46] atmosphere and he will do
[1:09:50] it has to be purified with fire
[1:09:57] aren't you glad for
[1:09:59] this that one day the headaches will
[1:10:03] stop there won't be any bad
[1:10:07] atmospher brother you won't be
[1:10:09] struggling with the
[1:10:11] devil everything will be glory
[1:10:14] everything will be
[1:10:18] praise see you can't even say glory to
[1:10:20] God
[1:10:22] now
[1:10:24] but I understand there are the
[1:10:32] atmospheres that we're barely getting
[1:10:35] started what are you going to
[1:10:39] do while there's a new
[1:10:42] creation while this
[1:10:45] globe is purified with
[1:10:48] fire what will you do with these
[1:10:52] atmosphere
[1:10:55] see see in the message here a there's a
[1:10:57] man who can start a light a
[1:11:00] fire because we believe that the sons of
[1:11:03] God have
[1:11:04] a remember and follow the
[1:11:08] line we're starting of we're speaking of
[1:11:11] Sons and Daughters
[1:11:14] of that while the atmospheres are full
[1:11:17] of
[1:11:18] Darkness there are sons of God
[1:11:22] walking remember
[1:11:24] this a Son of God can walk in the light
[1:11:28] hallelujah
[1:11:33] hallelujah the light comes from
[1:11:40] God the word the light came by the
[1:11:43] spoken
[1:11:44] word if you don't speak
[1:11:46] it if it does not come out of your it
[1:11:50] has no
[1:11:52] effect
[1:11:54] you think maybe God will heal me
[1:11:59] someday but it can't fit in your lips if
[1:12:01] you don't
[1:12:04] confess because the spoken
[1:12:07] word that has power on your
[1:12:10] life has power to deliver
[1:12:13] us when you're feeling
[1:12:16] tired speak to
[1:12:19] yourself I am a son of
[1:12:22] God
[1:12:24] I rebuke these negative
[1:12:26] atmospheres I am a Son of
[1:12:29] God a light here in
[1:12:34] me believe it
[1:12:36] brother believe it you'll see what
[1:12:38] happens later
[1:12:39] on
[1:12:45] yes God's word says let there be
[1:12:49] light when there wasn't
[1:12:52] light
[1:12:54] she sent the light to
[1:12:57] separate the
[1:12:59] Shadows from the
[1:13:04] light let's elaborate in this let's
[1:13:07] elaborate in
[1:13:08] this because I'm sure you don't
[1:13:11] understand
[1:13:13] this let me give you let me share to you
[1:13:16] a little of what God has given to
[1:13:19] me I know that this is dust
[1:13:25] I was formed from the dust of the
[1:13:28] earth you were formed from the dust of
[1:13:30] the
[1:13:32] Earth this
[1:13:39] body we came from the dust and we will
[1:13:42] return from the
[1:13:45] dust the atmospheres ENT body
[1:13:52] right the atmospheres that are are
[1:13:55] surrounding us right
[1:13:56] now they are connecting with this
[1:13:59] Earth with this dust
[1:14:02] this here the negative atmospheres
[1:14:07] come it's true
[1:14:13] Brethren and they want to continue to
[1:14:15] the spirit and if they get to the soul
[1:14:17] well it's
[1:14:19] done so the Bible and the prophet are
[1:14:21] saying this when there wasn't any
[1:14:26] light he sent the light to
[1:14:29] separate the Shadows from the
[1:14:33] light I realize that this
[1:14:35] dust is a shadow is a shadow it's true
[1:14:40] there ain't nothing good in
[1:14:42] here there ain't nothing good in this
[1:14:45] dust but
[1:14:48] God wants to separate this
[1:14:51] dust wants to open this
[1:14:56] so the light of God can enter in the
[1:14:59] soul because that's where the life
[1:15:06] is this word says the
[1:15:09] prophet
[1:15:18] demands he said he let go of the heaven
[1:15:20] so he can let the sun shine
[1:15:23] let's apply to our
[1:15:25] lives you have to move this
[1:15:29] dust let the son of the the son of the
[1:15:32] word of God this
[1:15:36] word can make contact with his light
[1:15:39] inside if it does not make
[1:15:43] contact he will never produce the life
[1:15:46] of Jesus
[1:15:47] Christ you can
[1:15:49] jump you can worship God but you will
[1:15:54] never produce
[1:15:55] life I want the life do you want the
[1:15:59] life you want the
[1:16:02] true
[1:16:04] emotions
[1:16:08] feelings Christ in
[1:16:11] US glory to
[1:16:13] God I haven't even gotone to my theme
[1:16:20] yet and his word today
[1:16:23] as the brother said today
[1:16:29] today it's the one that
[1:16:36] separates brother we want this to be
[1:16:40] separated because these atmospheres of
[1:16:42] the Eden of Satan wants want to
[1:16:47] stick because this dust is from the
[1:16:50] earth the dust calls the Earth
[1:16:54] but the spirit is calling something
[1:16:59] else his word today is the one who
[1:17:02] separates the
[1:17:04] atmosph of unbelief says the
[1:17:07] prophet what does this
[1:17:10] mean that sometimes you're calling
[1:17:13] these because of your
[1:17:17] unbelief
[1:17:19] yes every time that I'm doubting God's
[1:17:22] word
[1:17:24] there's a negative
[1:17:26] atmosphere because what the devil wants
[1:17:29] to
[1:17:31] do it's for you to not believe the word
[1:17:33] of
[1:17:34] God and when you disbelieve the word
[1:17:37] of there's unbelief in
[1:17:42] you things believe or
[1:17:45] disbelief that's when you create
[1:17:50] that but the question continues
[1:17:54] what can we
[1:17:59] do what can we do while there's a new
[1:18:01] Earth and a new
[1:18:04] Heaven forgive me when this world will
[1:18:06] be
[1:18:08] annihilated all the
[1:18:10] atmospheres what will we do in the
[1:18:14] meantime I'm starting my
[1:18:19] message see what the Bible
[1:18:21] says
[1:18:24] and second of
[1:18:27] Corinthians 5 ver ver
[1:18:32] 17 I hope you enjoy the
[1:18:37] word like I said we can have a service
[1:18:40] of Revival of
[1:18:42] jumping but that won't change your
[1:18:45] life I'll just make you have a good time
[1:18:49] here we want a change of our nature
[1:18:59] therefore If any man be in
[1:19:03] Christ he is a new
[1:19:10] creature all things are passed away
[1:19:13] behold all things are become
[1:19:15] new now I'm barely entering
[1:19:18] brother into
[1:19:21] it listening to a preaching of a a
[1:19:24] brother preached 4 hours and at the end
[1:19:26] of four hours he says I'm
[1:19:28] starting if you
[1:19:31] see there's also a new creation
[1:19:34] here there's a new creation in
[1:19:38] you when you are in
[1:19:42] Christ the prophet says how are you in
[1:19:48] Christ churches give you a
[1:19:51] handshake
[1:19:56] in church they give you a flyer and they
[1:19:58] say welcome you're a member of
[1:20:00] Christ but the prophet tells
[1:20:03] us to be in
[1:20:07] Christ you have to be born
[1:20:10] again enter in the body of
[1:20:13] Christ and
[1:20:16] that makes you a new
[1:20:19] creation you are a new
[1:20:21] creature
[1:20:23] when you are born
[1:20:25] again not only of
[1:20:28] water I baptized Hallelujah 15 years
[1:20:33] ago but I barely received the Holy
[1:20:35] Spirit not too long
[1:20:37] ago he's speaking of a new
[1:20:41] nature when this nature is
[1:20:45] changed to a divine
[1:20:48] [Music]
[1:20:51] nature how many
[1:20:55] who believes in a new nature hallelujah
[1:21:03] hallelujah if you see in second
[1:21:04] Corinthians right where we're
[1:21:08] reading it looks like Isaiah
[1:21:14] 65 because God works with this Earth
[1:21:17] just as he deals with
[1:21:18] the Earth because the
[1:21:21] Earth
[1:21:23] God works with the Earth the same
[1:21:27] way God wants to make a
[1:21:30] purification upon this
[1:21:33] Earth are you listening are you
[1:21:35] following
[1:21:37] me so you
[1:21:41] now
[1:21:44] you if you have been born
[1:21:48] again the Bible and the message back up
[1:21:55] that you are a new nature okay a new
[1:21:57] creature yes
[1:22:00] creature you
[1:22:04] are there has been a
[1:22:06] birth in the
[1:22:09] soul here you continue the
[1:22:13] same
[1:22:15] right but in your
[1:22:18] soul something has been
[1:22:21] born
[1:22:23] there's a new man
[1:22:25] that born of
[1:22:28] God that man does not
[1:22:31] doubt that man does not
[1:22:35] doubt Amen to God's
[1:22:38] word because has been born from the
[1:22:43] word the one on the outside doubts
[1:22:46] right on the
[1:22:49] inside that leaves God's mouth
[1:22:53] all right there's a new nature
[1:22:55] here if you have been born again
[1:22:59] now I'll read a
[1:23:04] quote and you tell me what you think not
[1:23:07] now maybe
[1:23:15] later read from the
[1:23:21] beginning we're speaking of a of a
[1:23:24] nature
[1:23:25] right when we've been
[1:23:29] born from the spirit of
[1:23:35] God God is not weak in one place and
[1:23:38] strong in the
[1:23:41] other if you have a little shadow of God
[1:23:44] in
[1:23:48] you maybe the minimum of God
[1:23:54] sometimes we want God
[1:23:55] to give me more
[1:23:59] God the prophet says if you have the
[1:24:02] minimum the problem is that sometimes we
[1:24:05] don't even have the
[1:24:08] minimum can we be honest this
[1:24:13] morning if you have the minimum of
[1:24:17] God then you have all of the
[1:24:21] Power
