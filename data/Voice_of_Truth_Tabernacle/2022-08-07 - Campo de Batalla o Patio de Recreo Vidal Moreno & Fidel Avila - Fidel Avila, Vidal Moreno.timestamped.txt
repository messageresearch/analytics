[23:35] the
[24:04] [Applause]
[24:07] [Music]
[24:16] god bless you um
[24:20] we're going to open our scripture
[24:24] um
[24:26] the book of ephesians chapter six
[24:30] versions
[24:53] let's read the word
[24:57] it says like this at least i see
[25:00] it says finally my brethren be strong in
[25:03] the lord and in the power of his might
[25:12] just put on the whole armor of god that
[25:14] he may be able to stand against the
[25:16] wiles of the devil
[25:22] diablo
[25:24] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[25:26] but against principalities against
[25:28] powers
[25:29] against the rulers of the darkness of
[25:30] this world
[25:32] against spiritual wickedness in high
[25:34] places
[26:39] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[26:42] amen amen uh you may be seated
[26:46] uh for a title
[26:48] brother uh fidel and i
[27:02] and uh you know it we leave it as a
[27:04] question
[27:06] uh you know i was uh just kind of
[27:08] thinking that we're still talking about
[27:10] the the temple being built
[27:16] and uh you know how the foundation had
[27:18] been laid
[27:21] and uh we know the foundation of all
[27:23] things is is the faith
[27:27] and you know i was just kind of studying
[27:31] and uh just kind of thinking on certain
[27:33] things
[27:35] oh you know uh the devil el diablo he's
[27:38] not really gonna bother you
[27:41] he's not really gonna gonna hinder you
[27:44] in any kind of way
[27:56] unless you claim you know you claim to
[27:58] believe in god's words
[28:56] and you know
[29:06] and you know they they think that you
[29:08] know it's it's more of like a picnic if
[29:10] piensan quest
[29:15] [Music]
[29:38] you got to get past those things
[29:42] because i believe
[29:44] oh that this is the battleground
[29:48] this is this is life or death
[29:51] you know and that's that's what i
[29:52] believe
[30:20] you know
[30:34] let's just read
[30:47] against the rulers of the darkness
[31:01] on a higher level
[31:05] to live a higher kind of life
[31:08] and when we come here
[31:10] you see and and there's uh you might
[31:12] have a little a disagreement with your
[31:14] brother
[31:19] [Music]
[31:44] it
[32:24] i don't want to be the devil's
[32:25] entertainment
[32:45] amen amen
[32:47] now when we when we sit there and we we
[32:49] talk about the spiritual warfare
[32:57] i want to read something brother branham
[32:58] says in one of his messages i think it's
[33:01] uh god revealing himself in simplicity
[33:06] and brother branham says this
[33:08] is he says it's a warfare
[33:11] estonia because the greatest warfare is
[33:14] going on is a spiritual warframe
[33:19] since now when god know this was going
[33:20] to come to pass
[33:24] [Music]
[33:27] just like the united states does for
[33:28] their army welcome
[33:32] we give a man a helmet to wear
[33:35] because we know he's going to use it
[33:39] we give him a spade to dig in
[33:42] oh we know it's a big it's about a
[33:44] 90-pound pack on his back
[33:55] [Music]
[33:59] but the army knows they've got to train
[34:01] him for that because he's going to need
[34:19] friends
[34:21] we gotta take the whole word of god
[34:25] because we're going to need it
[34:28] we've got to use every word that's in
[34:30] there
[34:46] not only
[34:51] [Music]
[35:56] but it goes
[36:24] as
[36:38] [Music]
[36:53] that's what he was attacking
[36:56] he was not attacking the man
[36:59] he was a turkey
[37:01] oh what the man said he believed
[37:05] he actually declared
[37:20] i want you to understand
[37:34] is coming of this
[37:35] when the devil sees something is coming
[37:40] that's when he begins to work
[37:43] because that's when he brought he
[37:45] brought the oppression
[37:47] that's when he tried to push
[38:38] [Applause]
[38:39] [Music]
[38:44] and that's when the fight actually
[38:45] begins
[38:48] when your faith is declared
[38:51] but if you don't have any faith instead
[38:53] not the nfa all those things can't be
[38:55] revealed to you
[38:58] the
[39:09] read the bible
[39:11] i go to church finally
[39:39] i want you to understand
[40:07] a man sharpened at the countenance of
[40:09] his friend
[40:11] [Applause]
[40:13] hey man a man you see when iron sharpens
[40:16] iron
[40:20] but there has to be a form of contact
[40:50] you see
[41:18] and then
[42:13] [Music]
[42:15] you say there what happens is that uh
[42:17] they cannot sharpen themselves
[42:22] and then they pick and and then there's
[42:24] that it's it's they're dull and stands
[42:26] in filo
[42:28] and god can't use something
[42:31] that's right i see yes you see the bible
[42:34] says
[42:35] that the word is sharper than a
[42:37] double-edged sword
[42:41] and what he's actually wanting to do it
[42:43] and seek it
[42:44] because he wants to sharpen you up
[42:48] you watch the sharper you walk
[42:50] he wants you to become an instrument
[42:52] instrumental a sharp principle
[42:56] instrument that can
[44:33] is
[45:59] word but in the person and a persona
[46:01] because there's no weakness in god's
[46:02] word
[46:04] i believe your creole got the word of
[46:06] god
[46:08] it's all power estonia
[46:10] it's all powers
[46:12] he
[46:41] you know just kind of talking about um
[46:43] the the power hey avlando solo sovereign
[46:47] you know uh
[46:48] the devil interrupts el diablo
[46:52] he tries to interrupt god's plan
[47:20] it says and behold there arose a great
[47:22] tempest in the sea
[47:24] and so much that the ship was covered
[47:26] with the waves but he was asleep
[47:31] matthew 8
[47:32] it's in there
[47:50] it says it says but he was asleep
[47:56] and then it says this and his disciples
[47:58] came to him and awoke him saying lord
[48:00] save us we perish
[48:04] in your salvation
[48:06] and he says unto them why are you
[48:08] fearful oh ye of little faith
[48:16] you see i want you to know this
[49:55] but the bible says
[51:34] we're moving
[51:47] is
[52:04] amen amen
[52:06] well
[52:08] i'll just leave the place for brother
[52:10] fidel
[52:11] fidel god bless you
[52:16] [Applause]
[52:42] is
[52:57] [Applause]
[53:31] then he answered and spake unto me
[53:32] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[53:33] zerubbabel saying not by mine nor by
[53:35] power but by thy spirit say the lord of
[53:37] hosts
[53:58] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[54:00] and the spirit against the flesh and
[54:02] these are contrary the one to the other
[54:04] so that you cannot do the things that
[54:06] you would
[54:08] the scripture
[54:22] i want you to understand
[54:35] i need to analyze
[55:32] i think the majority of times
[55:34] in picnic
[55:37] we're in a picnic
[55:40] we're in the playground
[55:46] if you notice the
[56:11] [Music]
[56:31] god's word is a sword
[56:35] but we use this sword in the wrong way
[56:39] use that sort of wound our brother
[56:42] that's sword
[56:56] my children
[57:24] anyone
[57:26] a minimum a man brother
[57:28] la palabra
[57:29] the word says brothers
[57:31] that's what that's how we do
[57:33] that
[57:38] we're
[57:47] is
[59:01] we're evil
[59:44] and we take refuge
