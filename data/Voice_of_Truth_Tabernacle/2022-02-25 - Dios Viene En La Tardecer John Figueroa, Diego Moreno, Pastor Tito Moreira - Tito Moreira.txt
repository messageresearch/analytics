[Music] because he was it's all or nothing leggings are for your feet use you use socks you can't do it halfway it's all or nothing all or nothing god bless you thank you amen god bless everybody johnny man i mean amen if you can uh open your bibles to the book of genesis chapter 24 verse 1 hey man i'll go ahead and read it and it reads like this it says and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand and under my thigh edith and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell [Music] on [Music] my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebecca came out who was born to bethlehem milka the wife of nahor abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder uh [Music] was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink [Music] sorry it was a lot of reading [Music] we find that abraham uh he he sought a wife for isaac and we see that that abraham didn't just want any wife for isis he wanted her to come from from the the line of believers you could say man and so here is abraham his days are numbered and then we see that he he brings his his servant his most trusted man and we see that he sends his servant and brother branham says in the message earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints he says and hear that that abraham is the type of god the father is a type of brother brandon amen and we we we know that abraham wanted a a wife for isaac of a god from godly people amen and and he wanted this bride to to come from his his belief say man amen and also isaac and rebecca are a type of uh jesus christ in the bride amen so so this being said that rebecca came from from abraham's lineage she was a predestinated seed she had the word inside of her she was uh the bride is made of the same word that jesus is [Music] and so abraham knew that there would be a bride suitable for isaac though he knew that there was going to be a seed that needed life [Music] amen is there a seed here a man amen so so now we're going to move on in the story how how eliezer made the journey to get to rebecca [Music] and how uh eliezer he took camels with him [Music] well and he took ten ten camels hey man there's ten camels for one person hey man so he was making sure that there was plenty of power to make sure rebecca got home to isaac amen so he comes with all his powers and he gets to the well [Music] didn't just choose any bribe he saw a bride according to god's word [Music] [Music] amen there's no other way the bride must fulfill the scriptures so the camels we said that they typified the holy ghost [Music] so i'm going to read this this quote real quick from brother branham it's in the same message earnestly continuing for the faith that was once delivered to the saints now listen listen to this [Music] with to see jesus someday amen so that's another thing about the bride is the bride has to worship there's no other way brothers it says here in john 4 24 she's worshiping but then i'm going to speed up a little bit here ellie easter comes for the purpose that he came for a man [Music] we as a bride have a decision to make [Music] it's decision time now [Music] is that rebecca was living in the evening or when they met eliezer and rebecca were in the evening time now you've got [Music] [Music] [Music] tonight you'll have to make a choice he goes on to say he says what did rebecca say she said i will go now she says praise god that's [Music] it says here in matthew chapter 24 verse 6 and 8. matthew 24 6 through 8. and it says like this and it says you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you ye be not trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for a nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and diverse places who prophesied about this brothers [Music] brother banner prophesied about these things he prophesied about russia about the woman [Music] we see that that brother brown's message is coming to fulfillment and it means that we don't have that much time amen and i first when i heard about the war i was i was scared hey man i'm almost 18. and i'm like well what if i get drafted i was thinking of maybe moving to canada or some some place that way hey man but but we see that brother brandon's message he's being fulfilled hey man so we have to make that decision hey man do you want to take this this bridegroom right man the bridegroom do you want it to be amen do we wanna do wanna do we wanna follow him amen amen god bless you brothers [Applause] i just want to read one scripture and this is genesis 24. versus they've spoken word of the lord to us they say and her brother and her mother said let the damn soul abide with us a few days at the at the least 10 after that she shall go no medicine guys and he said unto them hinder me not seen the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master hey yo responding and they called rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and she said i will go when we think about the evening time we don't have much time left at principal but the same thing happens as it happens in our daily days or daily routine to that same time on god's clock god's clock esta tiempo de la terre is on the evening time already estamos we see it worldwide what's happening in israel ukraine and russia brother branham 50 60 the rest of the world the bible says i believe if you are a bro you'll feel an urgence in your heart that there's not a lot of time that we must make a decision is tribulation that's right we have little where it's hard for us to make a decision god tells us god is telling them hopefully god is to be and they called rebecca and said unto her with this man she didn't have to worry how she would get there the holy ghost that called us oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] what are we waiting for look at it [Music] hello please stand i
