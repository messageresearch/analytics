Christ amen amen I mean they're happy to be in the house of the Lord how many youth came prepared amen amen this is our youth service amen amen um that's why um to tell you the verse that we'll be reading today if you could go with me to Ruth too and we'll be um reading verse two and three on Saturdays amen Ruth two chapter two verse two and three a man amen and our title for today is an inspired life amen amen amen for our Lord Jesus Christ amen and it says like this Naomi let me go out into the Harvest Hills to pick up the stocks of grain left behind by anyone who is kind enough to let me do it Naomi replied all right my daughter go ahead so Ruth went out to gather grain behind behind the Harvesters and as it happened she found herself working in a field that belonged to Boaz the relative of her father-in-law eliminally foreign foreign and I was reading and reading the background of these times and in these times there was a lot of mail it was a male male dominated in these times women or the woman didn't really have much to they couldn't really say anything a lot of them if they didn't have husbands they were poor muchas we see that Ruth went to go gather green behind the Harvesters and as we know her her husband had passed away as and she didn't have any children so in that way she was most likely poor so she was trying to survive see and we see that she went with Naomi I mean and Naomi told her it was fine that she could go out into the fields and and go get her food that she needed and we see that she she didn't she asked for Naomi's advice and we see that she was not used to doing this you see she had left her home behind yeah this was a new custom to her Nuevo costume she was following someone else's culture everything was new to her we see that she had to come out of her comfort zone um and she had to she had to learn new ways if we keep on reading we see that once you got out of her comfort zone and she started Gathering her food we see that Boaz noticed her I mean and he asked who is who is this girl and they told her a truth and we see if we keep reading it says he tells them to have her coming in and we see that she got noticed by Boaz [Music] and we see that she ate with Boaz we see that the Harvesters that told her or that allowed her to pick the food that she got priorities after them you see when we get out of our comfort zone God could do marvelous things in marvelous ways he can do something in your life quick you see it could have been about a two-hour space because she went to go pig and then Boaz noticed her and he said bring bring her and have her eat and if we keep reading and she still had leftovers so you see if we just let God work in our lives God could bless us so quickly we just gave ourselves to him amen but you see we see some people that have nothing you see sometimes we don't have very much amen you know we try to appear like we have something and you know I want to go to Romans 3 23.3 you see it says for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God Amen you see all of us have fallen shorts all of us have come short on dreams have come short on goals on our purpose and we have fallen short a lot of times and a lot of times while we fall in shorts It's because we're just spectating amen we're just Spectators of everyone else we have dreams we have goals we have our purposes but a lot of the times we're just on our social media socialism and we're just looking at other people's lives amen how their goals are being accomplished their dreams their purpose but we're just still sitting on our bed and we're wondering why we're sad amen we're wondering we're wondering why we can't grow amen a lot of times you don't do nothing because we're trying to preserve things what are we preserving in reality we don't have nothing in the first place so we're really not preserving anything We're just trying to preserve our bodies I guess but we're not preserving anything amen and you see a lot of times why we don't get out of our comfort zone it's because we don't want to take risk amen and if we um you know we have to take risk in our lives we have to get out of our comfort zone and do something with our lives my dad was sharing with me a quote that he heard and he said you know if you don't want to risk anything or have or have a a life you know have a life that's going to be enjoyable then would you you could just sit in a corner we'll give you uh three or we'll give you food there um you could stay there there'll be no risk just stay in your corner and you might live to be 80 100 years old but what kind of life will that be at the end of the day what are people gonna say about you [Music] that you were comfortable in your corner that you didn't accomplish anything you just accomplished to live 80 100 years old whatever age you you were able to get to or what kind of life would that be amen [Music] you see and I want to read this quote from Brother Branham I don't have it there it's just in English um but it says now notice the perverted the perverted life the devil inspiring it that's that life becomes miserable I've never seen it in all stages from the rich to poor I've had the privilege of being in King's palaces from that to the lowest huh on Skid Row I've never seen a Content a Content a contented sinner in my life that's right there's no happiness or contentment outside of Jesus Christ I've seen the I've seen them so rich every Los vistos so they have bodyguards with them and I've seen them so poor till they've begged for a drink of whiskey and from the one to the other there's no satisfaction yeah then what do they call that life how could you call it life when you want to take it it's not life and he says this now if the devil can't get you to to do something like that he's done something else now listen use he will let you be a gentleman and you'll pay your honest debts you'll treat your neighbors right he even says this you'll even join Church it's so joining church is not life singing hymns is not life preaching the gospel is not life only one way you can have life that's to know him you don't know and have Life by knowing knowing of the of your church you don't have Life by no in the Bible Life by knowing Christ is the only way that you can have life we can't just come here to church we can't just read our Bible we can't just talk about the words and have life we have to actually know Jesus Christ we have to be born again amen because if we don't we don't have life amen we're dead amen amen and I would like to read another quote um Sita thank you earnestly content for the faith [Music] preacher in 1955 [Music] and it says being rich yet become poor is that through his poverty we might be made Rich no rich in Heavenly blessings spiritual things we who were once poor Nosotros now become rich through his poverty Progreso amen you see property is a state of mind could have stayed in her property you see but something within her will not allow her to stay there amen she was willing to come out I learned something new you see she even went to boaz's fee if we keep reading and she uncovered her his feet and I I believe that was something really rare for her [Music] when Naomi told her to do that someone would have told me to do that I would have been like you're crazy but we see that she trusted Naomi I mean and she trusted in Boaz amen because Bo as we see he was a well-respected man as well he respected amen he didn't do anything with Ruth but you see Ruth got out of her comfort zone and we see that God blessed her when she came out of here you see we see this story and I was listening to a message earlier and you see a lot of us think this is a story of love they got married and everything [Music] but this is a story of redemption this is a story of them being redeemed amen see Ruth was just trying to survive day to day and you see Naomi was gonna have to do the same thing if they would have been redeemed amen if Bruce would have gotten out of her comfort zone they would have barely been surviving amen and you see a lot of times come to our minds and especially as youth especially yes and we don't want to get out of our comfort zone amen we don't want to sing a special we don't want to raise our hands amen we don't want to sing because we don't want want to get out of that comfort zone we're too scared of what other people are going to think of us what other youth might think okay but why not be a leader amen why not make a movement amen what if you raise it in your hands makes your neighbor raise their hands make sure neighbors say amen amen what if it helps them grow amen because like I've said before Spirits are contagious amen and if we could have a good spirit that can be contagious in this church and we could be a contagious in a good spirits I believe God could move within us amen amen amen and that's all I had for tonight amen God bless you foreign amenities like this is he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the cloud shall not reap El caliento Observer amen we're speaking on an inspired life amen I believe Ruth is a perfect example of that amen Perfecto amen and I particularly want to focus on risks amen because I believe that to live an Inspired Life you have to take risks as my brother before me said you have to get out of your comfort zone sometimes amen so Ruth had to take risks and many times we we have a negative attitude towards risks foreign amen I can personally relate with that um I wasn't raised here um and moving from from a different place isn't easy amen so she she moved from a foreign foreign amen amen and I really like something that my brother Isaac said he said that if you could live a risk-free life then that is and he says that but what kind of a life would that be I like it I like to take it a step further if you could live off risk-free life and be successful then would you do it I know that I would remember if I could live a successful life um then I would absolutely do it amen but unfortunately everything requires something uh in order to obtain something if you go over to a restaurant and you order some food and you pay for it you risk being disappointed if you cross the crosswalk at an intersection semaphroa um if you cross the crosswalk you risk getting run over here so my point with this is wrists are everywhere and then to some extent yes you have control over the risk that you take amen amen praise be to God amen as a preacher you can prepare so much and then the time comes and everything goes away amen amen you just be patient with me trying to find myself amen amen amen so I asked myself kind of looking at Ruth you know um she had already endured so some heavy losses I mean she lost her her soulmate her husband they probably didn't have any food there was famine in in her in her town so I asked myself like why why would she go go out of her way to go to a place she never been to okay because I think that Ruth had a greater purpose and having her belly filled amen I believe that it's because of Ruth that we're here amen she's in the lineage of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so I believe that she was a mediocre okay there's something inside of her that drove her to bigger and better things than men hey man I don't think that she could live another day I don't think that she could live another day in the same city with the same routine yielding the same results amen and many times I ask myself why why don't I see results in my life amen it seems like every day I try harder and every day I backtrack it seems like I try to serve God with all of my heart and I want to do great things for his kingdom sure that we all do amen and so I asked myself why don't I see a change why does it seem like the harder that I try kygo amen I think that the answer to that is that because you choose to live a life for God is that you choose to wake up every day knowing that you might fail and fail more the next day and more the next day after that and each day maybe you seem to become more of a miserable sinner amen amen but one one thing that I found while I was studying a little bit was that when you take risks if you take the right attitude correct it's a win-win situation amen you can take the risk and two things can happen you either a get the the you take the risk and you get the desired outcome amen la la because sometimes I think that it's either failure or success I'm beginning to realize that failure is a part of success without a success would be incomplete without it success would be incomplete amen amen amen how many want to take risks amen praise be to God and when I ask myself what would have happened had Ruth not gone how would she have ended up and then I looked at orpha and orpha was only mentioned twice in the Bible after that nobody heard nobody heard of her amen I asked myself amen and I realized that nobody remembers Ordinary People say it again nobody remembers Ordinary People amen I don't think God has any Ordinary People amen amen I don't think that we've ever heard of a man or a woman who lived an ordinary life and did remarkable things I mean it wasn't the person who sat on the couch it wasn't the person scrolling through their social feed amen not for that person I've been pursue it wasn't the person who didn't uh decided not to try hard in school or the person who settled for an eight to four job amen amen nobody remembers those types of things because those people are just like everyone else amen and I'm beginning to realize and I see it in my father every day is that if you want people to remember you have to be remarkable uh you have to be relentless amen and I think that Ruth displayed this perfectly because she has something that set her apart from everyone else amen it was her risk-taking it was her drive amen her work ethics the amount of work that she accomplished amen the Bible says that she only rested for a little while now because it's working and I imagine that that day that maybe Shia worked some of the guys that were working there amen amen personally I believe that it was Ruth's work ethics yielded the extraordinary results in her life amen and it really impacted me it says like this he says you can't accomplish a Million Dollar Dream he said on a minimum wage now that really speaks to me amen because everybody dreams big amen amen but does everybody work as hard amen and that that really speaks to me just because sometimes I I have these wild dreams you know I say I'm an accomplished amen I have it in my mind I even write it down sometimes remember the plan doesn't start when you write it down the plan starts when you actually start acting yeah amen and if you want if you want something in this life is we maybe Church isn't for you amen I hope it is I really do yo yo is remember I don't think that God wants us to be miserable either amen so I think that we should just be honest with ourselves sometimes amen but if you want something in this life if I can leave you with anything I'm just gonna make a little illustration say that you want a bag of chips at the vending machine and they're worth 1.50 you put a dollar in is you can't expect to get the bag of chips you fall short like so if you have a dream if you have any ambition in this life make sure that your work ethic lives up to the dream say and then otherwise you always come up short amen amen God bless you foreign foreign unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband this is [Music] assistant and thou has left thy father and mother in the land of thy Nativity and are coming to a people which is our newest not heretofore the Lord recompense thy Work and the full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust it will remuneration and we're talking about an Inspired Life you know and uh you know when we uh we talk about you know an Inspired Life I think when we talk about life in general and see uh there's there's only uh two ways of doing things I believe you could do it the easy way or or you could do it the hard way that's what I believe yeah I believe that uh We've we've chose the the latter joke then we've we've chose the the the the second thing is amen amen you know because when we are when we all look at roots and uh you know the the efforts that that she made you know oh it's it's very easy it's very easy to to uh be uh be critical critical you know on on uh especially yeah you know when when when you ain't doing nothing you know I I heard a I heard a quote and I really liked it and it said you know they don't make a statue for critics you know there's a lot of people you know there may be star rules you know and they saw her take action no and what she was doing this she's crazy she's gonna throw her life away I wonder if they don't say that about us [Music] the only way you can eliminate that down amen [Applause] ah man you know the way God starts something that's the way he finishes it is and he's gonna end it the same way brother he says take Faith rather and apply the blood of Jesus Christ by faith to the heart's door it says this was going to separate and make the difference between those who were going out of Egypt and those who were going to stay in Egypt and perish with Egypt difference and I like what he says here it made the difference that the blood made the difference that's what the difference was that's what the sign was the blood of Jesus Christ that's gonna make the difference you know we were cold here no we were not called here just to be good Christians you see the thing of it is above average results but you can maybe average I'm [Music] that's what I said will you hold on I thought you said screaming dreaming okay Glory we don't want to just be uh dreamers you know dreams you have dreams at night that's right that's the yes but Dreams they're not made at night Dreams Are Made during the day Los sueños that's right dreams are not made at night you can have a dream of nights and you live in the same life it was just a dreams our dreams are made during the daytime want to let you know it's up to you to make that happen as well do you know when rules when Ruth goes back to Bethlehem but when she goes there she could have went to any Fields that's right and you have your choice there's good Fields out there Fields out there in the world pick whatever you want they're good but they're not good enough for me I want you to notice she goes to the field you can this was a Field of Dreams ah it was the field of Grace in El Campo De Gracia and it was a field of abundance here was a field of forgiveness for whatever you need father look you stand necessity whatever you need that field has it is I want you to notice she didn't just go stand there in the field just go sit in the field but she want to go work in the field she went to go work and when she started working the owner of the fields he noticed when you start working for God he's gonna notice yes [Music] [Music] that's right brother yes he does the harder you push huh you know the more people you uh tend to leave behind sometimes the harder you push the more people you leave behind that's right we agree with that cuantos de cuerdo people don't want to work that's right brother they don't want to work so we have to be we have to understand not everybody's going to come with us not everybody's gonna not even gonna work for the Lord and if you haven't started maybe you can start tonight you know the harder you push the more you work the higher you go the more people step back they said that guy is crazy he's gone too far he's taking it to another level you know when they start criticizing you know the way they do you know and the reason is is that the you know they don't want to put in the work they don't want to put in the effort they want to settle down and they just want to just stay where they're at you know but throughout my life you know I'm closing now I used to have a lot of questions you know especially as a young man you know a young man I just I I always question things when the Lord was calling me I started getting answers you know the Lord's not going to leave you without a lot of the uh without answers you know he'll always give you an answer you just gotta keep working you just gotta keep following now you know in this field you know this is this is the field is it was the field of the Lord you know and that's what we're that that's that's what we're we're here doing we're here gleaning we're gleaning you know from the Lord you know and uh I can honestly say that you know there's many of my dreams Campo dreams can be achievedos it takes work trabajo [Music] it takes pain it takes sacrifice sacrificio it takes satoma it takes sufferings it takes rejections [Music] I don't know you know I don't work for the cheers I work for Jesus Jesus that's what I work for you trabajo that's what I live for but I ask for your evil and that's what I'll die foreign gracias but at the end of the day if I fall short I know just saying that the Lord will give me his hand he'll extend his hands all you do what you can you say Lord I've done what I could and when you've done what you could is your dreams as long as you're giving everything to the fields of the senor and I will guarantee you that your dreams will be fulfilled of the
