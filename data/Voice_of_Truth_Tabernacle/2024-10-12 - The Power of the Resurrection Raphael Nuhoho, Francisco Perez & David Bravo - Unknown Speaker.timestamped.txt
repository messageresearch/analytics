[22:32] peace amen
[22:34] amen can we please turn our
[22:38] Bibles to Romans
[22:41] 8 9
[22:47] to1 but ye are not in the flesh but in
[22:51] the
[22:52] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[22:55] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[22:58] spirit of Christ he is none of
[23:08] his and if Christ be in you the body is
[23:12] dead because of sin but a spirit is life
[23:15] because of
[23:24] righteousness 11 but if the spirit of
[23:27] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[23:29] dwell in you yes he that raised up
[23:31] Christ from dead shall also Quicken your
[23:34] mortal bodies by his spirit
[23:49] that amen
[23:55] amen the title sermon
[24:09] today our lord Jesus died and
[24:12] resurrected on the third
[24:17] day meaning he was Victorious over
[24:21] death death could never hold him
[24:25] captive even in the grave he was still
[24:28] the
[24:31] Lord even in the grave he was still the
[24:35] Lord one brother preached that uh Jesus
[24:38] Christ was went to preach when he was
[24:45] buried he went to preach to the lost
[24:48] souls and all those who believed
[24:53] him resurrected with him and got
[24:55] salvation
[24:59] and if you believe in Jesus
[25:01] Christ we shall also overcome
[25:05] death the S of death is
[25:10] broken and we are victorious as Paul
[25:16] declared uh death is something we all
[25:19] don't
[25:21] want nobody want to hear about
[25:25] death uh brother Braham has to look on
[25:28] on for their wife and the daughter to
[25:31] die very
[25:37] painful even Jesus Christ
[25:40] himself that he didn't want that
[25:42] tribulation to come over him when he was
[25:44] going to
[25:49] die even though he had the assurance
[25:52] that he was going to be
[25:55] resurrected we all scared of death right
[26:00] but we
[26:02] Believers just because our Lord Jesus
[26:04] Christ died and
[26:08] resurrected we are also going to be
[26:13] resurrected we see uh politicians and
[26:16] very rich people around
[26:20] right they move around with lot of
[26:23] security men
[26:28] with the police with the Secret Service
[26:30] with the FBI and
[26:36] all why they are scared of
[26:41] death they are scared of
[26:44] death they are scared of
[26:47] that but we Believers are
[26:53] victorious what do we do to keep our
[26:56] body so that we don't uh die early or be
[26:59] healthy all the
[27:02] time so we try to do more exercise
[27:06] right try to eat
[27:09] healthy more
[27:11] vegetables more
[27:13] fruit stay very very
[27:17] strong so do we think about our
[27:19] spiritual body as
[27:22] well you could be physically alive
[27:29] do we know that you can be walking
[27:32] around but you are spiritually
[27:36] dead so uh I've not attended a lot of
[27:40] funerals here though but back in
[27:45] Ghana when there's a funeral the
[27:50] pastor try to ask you guys in there to
[27:53] reflect
[27:58] ask you guys to not to weep for the
[28:00] person lying
[28:04] there but rather to weep for
[28:08] yourself but if you were the one lying
[28:13] there were you
[28:16] prepared are we prepared
[28:20] now and you know what happened at the
[28:22] moment when you're at the funeral and
[28:23] the pastor is talking about that
[28:29] everybody gets really
[28:31] sad like I'm very holy I'm only going to
[28:34] live right life I'm going to
[28:40] pray going to read the Bible every
[28:43] day oh my God after two days you forgot
[28:49] me because we only act when things
[28:53] happen right there
[28:58] the physical
[28:59] body so we don't need to think so much
[29:02] about our physical
[29:05] body we need to think more about our
[29:07] spiritual
[29:09] body we are spiritually we are
[29:12] physically
[29:13] alive but we could be spiritually
[29:17] dead the Bible says without Jesus
[29:23] Christ we are dead in our sins
[29:29] if we don't believe in
[29:30] him we are spiritually
[29:34] dead I movie I watched before The
[29:37] Walking Dead so the
[29:41] movie Walking the title
[29:45] of Walking Dead it's an old
[29:48] movie you could see dead people
[29:53] walking very funny and they tend to harm
[29:56] people who are alive
[30:00] I'm like that's not possible you are
[30:01] dead I'm alive how can it hurt
[30:06] me that's
[30:10] just we don't want to be a walking
[30:14] dead so we need to keep our spiritual
[30:16] life
[30:19] intact if we don't have the Holy
[30:23] Ghost we are
[30:25] dead but when Christ enters
[30:29] us he breathe life into
[30:33] us we are resurrected with
[30:37] him we always have to seek him
[30:40] first or else we're going to be walking
[30:45] dead the Bible also says in John
[30:52] 11:25 Jesus
[30:55] said I'm am the resurrection
[30:59] and the life he that believeth in me
[31:03] though you were
[31:04] dead shall
[31:07] live whoever liveth in
[31:09] me shall never
[31:12] die whoever liveth in
[31:14] me shall never die if you have
[31:19] Christ you have everlasting
[31:23] life and you have victory over death
[31:28] because the sting of death is
[31:32] broken our Lord Jesus
[31:36] Christ
[31:39] buried and he
[31:42] resurrected anything that we are buried
[31:46] in if it's against the will of
[31:50] God we also going to
[31:54] rise you don't only need to think about
[31:57] the physical death
[32:00] but most of the time theual one
[32:06] too what are we buried in
[32:09] today are we buried in
[32:12] sin and saham said is just an attribute
[32:16] of
[32:20] unbelief so I say are you buried in
[32:25] unbelief what is distracting us from
[32:28] closer to
[32:30] God Jesus Christ was
[32:33] buried and he rose up
[32:37] Victorious anything that we are buried
[32:41] in we are going to rise up as
[32:44] well the thing of death can
[32:50] never whatever we are buried
[32:53] in whatever that distract us from
[32:56] getting closer to God
[33:00] we can rise above it through
[33:05] Christ so we we go through the baptism
[33:10] right we always see the baptism over
[33:14] here so we are
[33:17] buried we
[33:19] resurrect so when we
[33:21] resurrect come in a new
[33:24] body filled with the Holy Ghost
[33:27] walk with
[33:29] Christ and for that we are
[33:33] victorious everybody in church here
[33:37] today must be
[33:40] resurrected if there's any spiritual
[33:43] death want to be
[33:46] resurrected if you are buried in
[33:50] anything if you are buried in anything
[33:51] that we scared
[33:54] of away from God
[33:58] rise up and
[34:00] resurrect amen
[34:03] amen I want to read a
[34:06] quote from Brother bram's
[34:09] book written in
[34:15] 1954 title is God's provided way of
[34:18] dealing with
[34:23] sin said I was standing out today
[34:29] watching some honey bees
[34:32] work and I watched those honey
[34:36] bees I
[34:40] thought well well when a honey bee ever
[34:45] stings a
[34:47] person then the Stinger is left in the
[34:52] person it cannot sting no more
[34:58] the honey be stinging is
[35:02] done any insect that stins you one
[35:06] time that finishes
[35:09] it because he leaves the Stinger
[35:12] there and I tell
[35:14] you Jesus Christ on
[35:18] Calvary pull a stinger out of
[35:23] death the out of death
[35:31] there there we sickness has no control
[35:36] anymore God done suffer it in
[35:41] judgment Jesus Took the stinger out of
[35:46] sin Jesus Took the stinger out of
[35:50] sickness Jesus Took the singer sorry the
[35:53] Stinger of San
[35:58] Jesus Took the stinger out of
[36:01] sin and tonight he's
[36:04] helpless
[36:07] devil there's no
[36:09] Sting the sting is
[36:12] broken our Lord Jesus Christ has broken
[36:14] that
[36:16] thing hallelujah hallelujah he can only
[36:22] buz and make lot of
[36:24] f but he's got no stinger
[36:28] the devil can only scare
[36:31] us but he cannot harm
[36:33] us his things are
[36:37] broken Paul
[36:40] said oh
[36:42] death where is your
[36:45] s
[36:47] grave where is your
[36:49] Victory thanks be to
[36:53] God he gives us the victory
[36:57] our Lord Jesus
[37:00] Christ whatever that is keeping us
[37:02] buried in this
[37:05] life is it
[37:08] unbelief is it
[37:11] pain is it
[37:14] fear let's remember that Jesus
[37:19] rose and whatever your situation is it
[37:22] will rise
[37:25] to whatever your situation you will rise
[37:31] too we have
[37:33] victory over every form of
[37:37] death because our Lord Jesus
[37:40] Christ was
[37:42] Victorious and if you believe in the
[37:44] Lord Jesus
[37:47] Christ over
[37:50] death we have
[37:53] victory of over every form of death
[38:00] physical

[46:53] man he made himself a because wanted to
[46:58] feel what you feel he wanted to go what
[47:03] you go
[47:04] through he wanted to go through or have
[47:10] sicknesses why
[47:12] brother a god with power because he
[47:16] knew that he had to make
[47:19] himself
[47:22] human he had it all
[47:24] brother that is the Almighty
[47:28] the god of
[47:30] power that we have in this day he is not
[47:33] dead and what did he do
[47:37] Brothers he went to the deepest point of
[47:40] of the depths of of the deep to
[47:45] hell and he knocked on the
[47:48] door he didn't have to knock on the door
[47:52] it's God it's Jesus
[47:55] Christ he didn't have to do that and
[47:59] even then he still did
[48:02] it and when they cracked the
[48:04] window and they seen it was
[48:07] him they
[48:09] laughed this one's ours now I imagine
[48:14] brothers that they were kind of savoring
[48:17] that
[48:18] taste because those demons the
[48:21] devil thought that they had him in their
[48:24] hands oh Brothers
[48:28] but they didn't
[48:30] know that he's a
[48:32] God is the Lord Jesus
[48:35] Christ who was
[48:37] incarn but when he got
[48:39] there
[48:41] he was any
[48:44] man he was someone
[48:46] special because he had a
[48:49] plan that he went to that
[48:51] place to take the keys
[48:57] of the
[48:58] gates of death to the keys of
[49:03] death so that's why I ask this question
[49:06] to
[49:06] you are you ready to
[49:11] die what a
[49:14] question as our brother rapael
[49:18] said it scares you
[49:20] right let me tell you brother that we
[49:25] ourselves are someone someone
[49:28] special we
[49:30] ourselves shouldn't be afraid of
[49:36] death young man young
[49:39] lady if you truly know who you
[49:41] are don't fear death
[49:47] why because you've served youve accepted
[49:50] a living God who has power
[49:57] of
[49:59] resurrection and he still has
[50:02] it and that is the
[50:04] devil because the Devil Couldn't with
[50:07] God and so he goes against his
[50:10] children I tell my
[50:13] wife my
[50:17] love you know why the devil goes against
[50:20] our
[50:21] children because he can't with you and
[50:23] die think about it Church
[50:30] when Satan could no longer with
[50:32] God and who does he go
[50:35] against he goes against
[50:37] us he makes us suffer but let me tell
[50:41] you
[50:43] tonight stop
[50:45] suffering you have the
[50:48] power you have the power in your hands
[50:52] it is yours
[50:55] tonight stop
[50:57] suffer and you talk with the
[51:02] devil devil yes devil don't because you
[51:07] are a son and
[51:09] daughter of the Lord Jesus
[51:13] Christ so because you have that because
[51:16] your
[51:17] father not just any
[51:20] father but a true
[51:23] father that has the power of death
[51:27] he has the power of
[51:30] sicknesses illness he has the power of
[51:34] cancer he has the
[51:36] power of
[51:38] depression he has the
[51:40] power whatever you want whatever you
[51:43] need that power is in your
[51:50] hands young man young
[51:53] lady from here on now
[51:56] apply the word because the spoken word
[52:00] you have it in your
[52:02] hands and not only that
[52:05] brothers that great
[52:09] man there was a dead
[52:12] man and he'd been four days
[52:15] dead many of us know that
[52:19] story and he was there
[52:26] what were they doing at lazarus's
[52:32] grave what was he doing they're
[52:37] sitting and what did lazarus's sister
[52:41] say Lord Jesus
[52:43] Christ you should have came
[52:45] sooner you're
[52:49] late glory to God
[52:52] brother God is never late
[52:56] though he was four days
[52:59] dead but that is the
[53:01] power
[53:03] Resurrection in this
[53:07] day maybe we find ourselves
[53:10] dead dead in the
[53:13] spirit the
[53:15] power
[53:17] quickening the
[53:19] power the Holy
[53:21] Spirit more
[53:25] power this
[53:28] it's
[53:29] ours it's yours it's
[53:35] yours what keeps you from it what
[53:37] hinders
[53:39] you
[53:42] nothing in four days he'd been dead he
[53:46] died
[53:48] Lazarus and what was Martha
[53:52] saying oh Lord he's dead already why do
[53:54] you come
[53:57] what came from her lips or what came
[53:59] from his
[54:01] lips I want you to focus what happened
[54:04] what he
[54:06] said what came from his
[54:08] mouth
[54:12] Lazarus come
[54:15] forth come forth
[54:18] Lazarus come
[54:22] forth that
[54:24] power that power
[54:27] is still here in this
[54:30] day there's no time to
[54:34] be sick there's no
[54:38] time to be in sadness there's no time to
[54:43] be in depression there's no
[54:45] time that I have cancer there's no time
[54:50] and play Church he's coming he's coming
[54:54] and he's
[54:57] he's more near than what we think the
[54:59] power the
[55:01] power of Resurrection is here God bless
[55:06] you
[55:17] Brothers God bless you
[55:21] Brothers hear
[55:25] me I'm really nervous tonight
[55:28] brothers and the reason
[55:31] is I'm pretty sure brother Raa stole my
[55:36] notes but it's okay because I'm G steal
[55:38] his
[55:40] title I'm just
[55:46] playing if we can please open our
[55:48] scriptures real
[55:50] quick to Luke
[55:53] 24 verse 21
[55:59] and it says like
[56:00] this but he trusted that it had been and
[56:03] he which should have redeemed Israel and
[56:05] beside all this today is the third day
[56:08] since these things were
[56:18] done these were the ones who were
[56:20] walking to
[56:24] emus now if you can jump to verse
[56:30] 25 then he said unto them oh fools and
[56:33] slow of heart to believe all that the
[56:35] prophets have
[56:41] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[56:43] these things and to enter into his
[56:50] glory and beginning at Moses and all the
[56:52] prophets he expounded unto them all in
[56:54] all the scriptures the things conc in
[57:05] himself I would like to thank my
[57:08] pastor for the trust he placed in me to
[57:11] be here
[57:13] tonight and I also like to thank
[57:16] God for allowing me to be here
[57:20] tonight now Jesus here is telling the
[57:22] people from going to emus
[57:27] that Christ had to
[57:30] die and Rise Again to fulfill the
[57:35] scriptures you know tonight the
[57:38] theme that I would like to
[57:42] bring is overcoming spiritual
[57:47] death now many
[57:49] times we're on our walk with
[57:53] God and in this walk
[57:56] we make
[57:57] mistakes you know many times we
[58:01] fall but you know one of the greatest
[58:03] mistakes we
[58:06] make as we decide to stay down
[58:10] there and we let the sin pile
[58:14] up and it slowly takes over
[58:20] us and we begin to die
[58:25] spiritually you know it's little by
[58:27] little maybe sometimes we stop reading
[58:30] our Bible a little
[58:33] bit we stop praying as much as we
[58:38] did you know something else takes over
[58:43] us but
[58:45] youth it's time that we wake
[58:49] up we don't have
[58:51] time to be down in
[58:54] sin to be spiritually
[58:58] dead we were not called for
[59:01] that you know many times as
[59:04] youth we say we're the future of the
[59:08] church but I say to you we're the
[59:13] present it's time we act like
[59:16] it you know many times we come to
[59:20] church and we seem
[59:24] dead we're just sitting there on the
[59:27] pews we can't even lift our
[59:30] hands we can't even say
[59:33] Amen we got to wake
[59:36] up
[59:38] why because the Lord Jesus Christ died
[59:40] for
[59:42] us to give us a
[59:44] chance the
[59:47] opportunity to go back
[59:51] home we need to realize the state of
[59:53] spiritual death we're in
[59:58] you know when the penalty of sin is
[1:00:02] death but we have the
[1:00:05] medicine and it's called
[1:00:08] Jesus because he
[1:00:10] said I am the
[1:00:13] resurrection and the life he that
[1:00:17] believeth in
[1:00:18] me though he were
[1:00:21] dead yet shall he
[1:00:23] live and whosoever liveth
[1:00:28] and believeth in me shall never
[1:00:32] die believest thou this do you believe
[1:00:36] that
[1:00:37] church do you believe that
[1:00:40] youth I'd like to read a scripture from
[1:00:43] Brother
[1:00:46] Bam from the resurrection of Jesus
[1:00:48] preaching
[1:00:54] 56 Jesus said oh are you so slow at
[1:00:59] heart and watch when Jesus
[1:01:03] appears he goes straight to the
[1:01:06] scripture he said don't you know the
[1:01:08] scriptures must be
[1:01:12] fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah brother
[1:01:15] I feel awfully good right
[1:01:18] now don't you know the scripture has to
[1:01:20] get
[1:01:22] fulfilled and when people say they
[1:01:27] oh it's mental
[1:01:29] telepathy oh it's nothing to
[1:01:31] it it's just a bunch of Holy
[1:01:35] Rollers don't you know the scriptures
[1:01:37] must be
[1:01:39] fulfilled God has to appear in the last
[1:01:44] days and do the things he's doing
[1:01:48] now it's time to fulfill the
[1:01:52] scriptures he said and they shall come
[1:01:55] to pass in the last
[1:01:58] days I will pour out my
[1:02:01] spirit there it is
[1:02:03] Brothers he told us he would give us the
[1:02:07] gift of the Holy
[1:02:09] Ghost that's the
[1:02:12] Cure that is our
[1:02:15] medicine to overcome
[1:02:18] death overcome
[1:02:21] sin we just have to
[1:02:24] recognize the state of sin we are
[1:02:28] in the state of spiritual death we are
[1:02:32] in and get back
[1:02:35] up and keep on
[1:02:37] fighting not give any more land to the
[1:02:42] devil because if you give the devil an
[1:02:47] inch he's gonna take a
[1:02:50] mile you can't give him
[1:02:53] anything cuz he is going to take
[1:02:55] advantage of
[1:03:03] we need to let Jesus into our
[1:03:09] hearts in order to have our own
[1:03:13] Resurrection from our condition of
[1:03:15] spiritual
[1:03:20] death we all know the Story of
[1:03:24] Lazarus how Jesus Jus came four days
[1:03:27] after he
[1:03:31] died and Lazarus
[1:03:35] sister said Lord if you had been here
[1:03:38] earlier
[1:03:41] soon my brother would not have
[1:03:45] died but
[1:03:48] Brothers he's with us all the
[1:03:52] time we have the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:57] but many
[1:03:58] times we refuse to
[1:04:02] recognize the state in which we are
[1:04:07] in we
[1:04:09] refuse to let the Lord help
[1:04:13] us come out of the position we are
[1:04:18] in but
[1:04:21] tonight
[1:04:22] youth let us have our own Resurrection
[1:04:27] from our condition of
[1:04:30] sin let us come out of the
[1:04:33] muck out of that
[1:04:36] filth just like Jesus
[1:04:39] said
[1:04:41] Lazarus come out come out place your
[1:04:45] name
[1:04:47] there
[1:04:48] David David come out of
[1:04:52] there you can't stay there
[1:04:55] you have to get
[1:04:57] up you can't stay
[1:04:59] down for my word
[1:05:02] says you are more than an
[1:05:07] overcomer we may fall seven
[1:05:11] times but the Lord lifts us up eight
[1:05:15] times we must overcome tonight
[1:05:19] youth I don't know what you're going
[1:05:21] through these past few weeks have been
[1:05:23] very hard on me
[1:05:28] but diving into God's
[1:05:32] word I
[1:05:34] recognize that I need my own
[1:05:38] Resurrection I need my own experience
[1:05:40] with
[1:05:42] God experience after
[1:05:46] experience over and over
[1:05:49] again
[1:05:51] daily
[1:05:53] daily we have to Die daily
[1:05:56] it's a daily
[1:06:00] decision I want to read this this quote
[1:06:02] from Brother
[1:06:04] Bram spiritual Amnesia preaching
[1:06:11] 64 I most surely was with him at
[1:06:17] Calvary look what he says
[1:06:19] here I must be identified with him at
[1:06:22] Calvary
[1:06:26] I must be there to a
[1:06:28] place that were not also was I
[1:06:30] identified with him in
[1:06:37] Calvary I died with him at
[1:06:41] Calvary every Christian must die with
[1:06:44] him at
[1:06:47] Calvary if you don't die with him at
[1:06:51] Calvary you can't be none of his
[1:06:55] I was there when he
[1:06:57] died I died with
[1:07:00] him oh and then I was with him when he
[1:07:02] raised up from the
[1:07:06] dead I come up on Easter morning with
[1:07:09] him in the
[1:07:13] resurrection whatever he
[1:07:16] did I was right there with
[1:07:19] him every believer was the
[1:07:23] same and now I am seated in heavenly
[1:07:25] places in Christ
[1:07:31] Jesus with all the powers of Hell
[1:07:34] conquered through
[1:07:37] him every Christian believer will SE it
[1:07:39] the same
[1:07:42] way because you have to be
[1:07:46] identified we have to identify
[1:07:50] ourselves in Christ in his death but
[1:07:54] also in his resur
[1:07:56] res we must
[1:08:00] resurrect not just in a bodily
[1:08:03] form but
[1:08:06] spiritually why I don't know about
[1:08:09] you but I want to make it
[1:08:13] home I want to go back
[1:08:16] home I want to go see my
[1:08:18] father I want to go see my
[1:08:24] redeemer we must
[1:08:27] overcome our spiritual
[1:08:33] death and we do that by
[1:08:36] Christ you know brother BR says and how
[1:08:38] can I
[1:08:41] overcome preach in
[1:08:44] 63 you look back and say I'm doing this
[1:08:46] and I'm doing
[1:08:50] that then oh you're
[1:08:53] defeated but look here
[1:08:57] but there is no condemnation to them
[1:08:59] which are in Christ
[1:09:04] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:09:07] after the
[1:09:10] spirit then you realize that you've
[1:09:15] overcome that's when we
[1:09:18] overcome when we
[1:09:21] recognize who our God is
[1:09:25] going down to
[1:09:29] 70
[1:09:31] overcome the god that's in
[1:09:34] you is greater than that that's in
[1:09:39] him the god of the
[1:09:42] world is not as
[1:09:44] great as the god of Heaven which is in
[1:09:49] you because my
[1:09:52] God
[1:09:54] resurrected and he has power over
[1:09:57] death he has power over the keys of
[1:10:02] hell he has power over
[1:10:05] everything but let me ask
[1:10:07] you does he have power over your
[1:10:11] life does
[1:10:14] he we have to ask ourselves these
[1:10:16] questions
[1:10:19] brothers and you know it's time for
[1:10:22] us to fulfill the scriptures as well
