[Music] of the world you step down into darkness open my eyes let me see [Music] beauty that made this [Music] amen God bless you brothers and sisters can we give a stronger Applause to the Lord he is worthy he deserves praise the fact that you're here tonight means a lot to him the fact that you made the decision to come here tonight it means a lot because you had an initiation you know even if your parents brought you um I feel like there was something inside of you that said I want to go to church today how many love him I want to think for the trust and um if we can please open our scriptures to the book of First Kings chapter 19. verse if when you have it if you can please say Amen and it reads like this so he got up and ate and drank strengthened by that food he traveled 40 days and 40 nights until you reach Horeb the Mountain of God uh there he went into a cave and spent the night and I'll stop there your heavenly father we give you thanks Lord for giving us the privilege to be here once again Lord we know that we can always come into your house Lord and you know that everything is for a purpose Lord I asked you may know in my lips as well as my the preachers Lord may we grasp something from this Lord we ask you all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now we're we're talking about Elijah you know we're finishing up with Elijah now is and so now coming towards the end of Elijah had failed say that again they had films you know and then here's Elijah you know heading into a cave you know how many of us sometimes like we hide in our little caves because in our lives we have caves that we hide we hide stuff from from others or we try to hide things from God let me tell you something you can't hide nothing from God there's not a single thing you can hide you know you may hide from you you may hide things from your parents from your brother your sister from your pastor but there's one person you cannot hide something and that is you know and as as I look into the definition of a cave definition you know one of the definitions a place providing privacy or seclusion from others now let me ask you tonight how many of you have a cave now the second um definition of a cave definition capitulate or submit Under Pressure you know and that's what the devil does yes you know he'll put you under pressure you know he'll put you under pressure to do things that you never thought you would do you know and then that takes you to a cave now the third definition that I have is a cave is a hollow space underground [Music] that's big enough for a person to walk or crawl into then now you know can sometimes be small and crampede comfortably you know and that's how sometimes we are yeah we have things in our life that we feel like we can't get rid of course you know but when you go into a cave you know the the devil paints it differently you know you know things will take you into that cave no depression anxiety whatever it is you know the person will take you things you never thought you would do or you know you're going to a cave of addiction you know it doesn't necessarily have to be an addiction of you know alcohol you know what if it was an addiction you know but the devil paints it you know oh look at this cave it's it's has flowers it has a disco ball in the middle of course you know and then you get you there has to be an attraction to go into that cave you know because something had to draw you into that cave in the first place you know and that's what happened with Elijah you know Elijah fell into such a depression you know that he thought that nobody was with him so he hides in a cave is so then I asked you again do you have a cave that others don't want to see like I said you can't hide nothing from God you know the author of Life the one who gave you life in the first place the one who has you here standing or sitting right here at this momento I like to read a quote from Brother Branham in the message he says look at Elijah Mirena when he called fire to heaven rain out of heaven and done the things that he did that day and when the spirit left him he was 40 days and nights out in the wilderness God found him he pulled back in a cave personally for myself I wouldn't like for God to find me in a cave relax you know in my comfort zone you know because when I'm in my comfort zone you know I I don't read my Bible I don't listen to a message I don't have that conversation with god I don't have that prayer with him and that's how why sometimes we feel disconnected from God it's because in the first place we didn't give time to God and that's why we go into that cave because we've pushed him aside we've left them over there in a little corner you know so when we talk about a cave you know a cave it's dark you know brother Branham used to go into a cave you know he used to go pray you know so so that that takes me that there's different types of caves you know where you can have either an encounter with God or be held on to something that you don't want as an addiction or anything this is you know bad influences will take me to that cave Las malas influences the music will lead me to that cave not all the music just the bad news you know so so I think it's time to we that we reevaluate our lives you know because God is telling you tonight for I know the plans that I have for you declares the Lord plans to prosper you oh not to harm you no no plans to give you a hope and a future you know so a child of God should not fall into depression because he has God so if we have God in our side and we maintain that communication with him our prayer with him our time that we give him there's no need to fall into those things foreign a different plan for you you know but we like to have our own goals and it might not be what God wants and then sometimes we try to fight against the currents and we try to go against what God has for us but how why is it that we can't trust God more you know just just like Elijah something something I'll go something had to take him to that cave something had to take him to feel the way that it made him feel alcohol the pressure from the world Hallelujah now let me tell you something do eagles fly in caves Eagles can't fly in caves so if you're an eagle tonight so there's no need to see that to fall into that cave when you have God on your side God bless you Brothers so first things verse 9 is what we're reading tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what do this thou hear Elijah El responded to saltares and he said I have been very jealous of the Lord God of hosts for the children have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altars and signed thy prophets with the sword and I even I only left and left and they seek my life to take it away El telemoto and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great strong wind rent the mountains and broken pieces of the rock before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the win an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake delicado and after the earthquake of fire but the Laurels are in the fire and after the fire is still small voice [Music] and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face and his Manton went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what do is thou hear Elijah it may be seated because Elijah when Elijah that's why I asked where we left amen because Elijah had been on my screen mirrors I spoke to the heavens for the rain to come down or the fire sorry entonces and that's when we feel pressured we can be in under a great anointing right here but what about when we go home amen I mean it is and I've had those flings after I'd come out of a meeting it looked like I tired and preached and begged and persuaded and seen the angel of the Lord God sweep through the meeting and do signs and wonders and sit in a car on the outside and hear them cry say it was nothing but psychology there was nothing to it nothing to that that's all nonsense hey man I think many times what we come to see is the man and we don't see God he's going to come with everything I mean the great things don't make a lot of noise [Music] it doesn't make any noise God has done great things have you heard the sun come out with a lot of noise the great things don't make a lot of noise God works in Simplicity I mean amen oh then I called under the juniper tree crying Lord what did you why'd you let me do it foreign God knows your trials just know this he knows all about it so then he comes down again [Music] he's got to take his life and he gave him food and brother Brandon Says angels that sandwich or the piece of bread how what nutrients that piece of bread would have had he was able to walk for 40 days and so he got to the cave a Ming Amen brother Branham says sometimes as I did one time a pistol against my head to commit suicide but I couldn't do it I took my glove off to lay it on a high voice but I couldn't do it something still helped the same God that was with Elijah is that same God today he's seen me under the Juniper I mean amen my wife laying Yonder in the grave and my dad and my brother-in-law is when I was just about gone myself it's hard time and I got to a place where I was so beside myself I tried to make a gunshot but it didn't work there's work yet to be done something has to be done God wasn't finished he won't always take care of you sometimes we feel a lot of times we feel that we can't go on any further [Music] [Music] God loves me Where We Are just see does God really know me [Applause] foreign it doesn't need to sue for damages it needs repair it's the truth he knows where you are he knows where you're laying I mean amen it doesn't matter Elijah is throwing its a quiver he was in that cave as using it as a refuse he got to that cave to use that as a refugee because they wanted to kill him where are we going tonight we have to go to the road because he was underneath taking shots and that's where God wants to go find him I mean amen [Music] the Lord Jesus bless you yeah glory to God [Applause] verse 13 says they're in First Kings [Music] and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face and his man's one went out and stood in the entering Inn of the cave unable and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear Elijah Elijah running from his fears from not wanting to face his realities he gets into a cave circumstances to escape his circumstance what was happening to him he searches for a quick uh for a quick solution he goes and gets into a cave come on trying to evade what was going on around him not wanting to face what was actually happening within him it happens many times it affects who we are on the inside and sometimes what happens sometimes what happens outside whether or not we want to say what happens many times it affects my identity it affects who I am that's what I represent Elijah trying to flee he goes and gets into a cave but it's in that conditions sometimes we have to face our reality many times foreign around me when I turn the back my back on everyone who am I truly why do I feel this way why am I going to do what I'm going through and it's in those moments in our lives many times you don't need a revivals you need to be on the floor [Music] in the times when I'm alone you have to speak to ourselves and you and God just have to talk Lord who am I true Holy Spirit the answer sometimes doesn't come from outside says there came an earthquake outside that shook the cave where he was sitting there was a mighty rushing wind pagos there come Thunders and Lightnings for gives us more light on what the word of God God is saying all of it was God how many believe a prophet no distance all of that was God sometimes in the Thunders that is god brother Brandon says foreign foreign your mercy is the only reason I'm here Lord if I didn't know that God could do great things and many times he's not doing it in my life could do the impossible because I said Lord what about me what about me God is where my frustration comes because I know what God can do say look at your skin in capacity I know what God's capable but God isn't doing anything in my life that's right and he had rushing winds and said fire out of Heaven do you see Elijah's frustration of the things he knew God could do but he wasn't doing them in Elijah's life because sometimes is our frustration because we know they can do the imposters are you with me Church but he waited I like that but he waited and way down inside of him in his interior inside of him that voice did not come from the outside Church did not come from outside always came from inside when am I going to overcome this you hear a small voice from inside Hallelujah I like this is attracted there was something he has seen his power to do this God has done great things I want it in my life amen what you can do through [Music] it his power to do things but this time he felt his presence a long time in church yesterday we've been a long time in church yeah [Music] [Music] that he is there supresences his presence changes his presence changes everything no no no no no no no no no no I can't understand why Moses because I want to feel your pressure it's presence it's when you know and it's not a feeling this is I know he's there yes knowing that he's with us when he's with us is of my life in the cave have you seen a brother in the cave isolated he doesn't want a shaken ingredients that's fine Brothers you know what let me tell you that if you've been a long time in the case I think it's time to come out because your life it doesn't depend only on being in the cage the cave has its purpose I continue fighting right amen but this is a peaceful voice speaking to his heart so when the prophet raises up and comes out the door of the cave youth young lady brother sister what keeps you in the cave what calls us back with your complexes with your excuses that tells you know there's a greater reason for us being here foreign [Music] I'm gonna feel happy I think from increasing to increasing increase to increase by faith Brothers so many empty benches Christ foreign we [Music] don't have the numbers inside we have a lot of things inside of us but we haven't trans we haven't gave that to someone someone else transfer that to someone the reason why Elijah felt the way he felten was because he had to transfer something he had inside of it he had to do a great job and he had the empties the reasons why sometimes we feel sorry because we don't share what we have right that's right that's good sometimes I feel the way to someone and said to them you know what I want to speak to you of a prophet God said yes and that brings you happiness because it's a new life [Music] we don't know the people that God is working with [Music] [Music] how to make that transfer [Music] out of the cave God sends into a field and there's where Elijah was God was already working with Elisha he was going to be the success and you know what he said yes the most faithful man Elijah Elijah had seen something in Elijah sometimes we don't see what God has given us inside of you [Music] because of so many things [Music] he found his Elisha is [Music] but he gave him a double portion what a tremendous prophet is [Music] he laughed because he had nothing else he had emptied himself of course there's a work for him to be done there's still many things to do the positive word for the bride I have that one is that word that came from Heaven is difficult times of my life that voice it gives me joy it's the voice of God sometimes the songs Don't calm me down sometimes it calms me down to hear the uh a message because it's the voice of God God bless you Brothers [Applause] [Music] may you please stand Brothers I believe the Lord is here in this night to come out of that cave I have a question for you this night is [Music]

not what Elijah needed then Thunder Fuego fire [Music] that's not what he needed what he wanted us to hear the voice of God sweet voice [Music] to listen to his voice is sometimes [Music] we don't
