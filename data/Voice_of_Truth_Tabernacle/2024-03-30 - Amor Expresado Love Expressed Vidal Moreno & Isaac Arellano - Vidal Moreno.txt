we don't not come lightly tonight it is a a meaningful day for us it is a good Friday it's the day our lord Jesus was bruised when he was marred for us so we could have life want to send a greeting to everyone watching through the internet and everybody here in the audience God bless you and our title for tonight is love Express if you can turn quickly to Isaiah 536 with me when you have it you can say Amen Isaiah 536 and it reads like this all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all God bless his word if you can help me pray heavenly father thank you for this special moment Lord that we receive more of your Revelation father receive more of your unconditional love Lord if anybody here is not understanding what happened this day Lord May at the end of the service you reveal to their hearts and Lord for what you've done for me I can't give you anything else than my own life Lord use it father use the lives of my brothers that you bought Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated brother just want to uh tell you a little bit about myself before we get into the thick of it our subject is about love in this night but I wanted to originally speak about Judas I wanted to before I was feeling pressed all week and it's the judases of life it's the judices of life that push us to where we need to be anybody understanding what I'm saying Judas pressed the Lord Jesus betrayed and that's how we received the beautiful scent of the uh Rose of Sharon amen that was Jesus Christ I would like to make a comparison but before that because I was going getting pressed in my week the devil wanted to change my focus to Judas on this day on Jesus's day kind of ironic but I began to read the message we appreciate judas's work but we need to speak about Jesus today it's Jesus's day today it's his weekend I'm sorry Jesus's weekend amen although it should be every weekend but today it's more special now instead of preaching about the crucifixion I would like to when I was young nobody really explained to me other I'm sorry go ahead other than Jesus died for my sins and that's all you hear in the denomination but tonight there are many other reasons why the crucifixion had to happen the way it happened and I would like to take you first with Adam and Eve forgive me if I'm very slow I'm sensitive right now to understand what happened in uh Calvary we have to understand what happened in Eden in Eden Eve sinned Eve sin and God had to kill sheep because the law was the day you eat of this tree you shall surely die so Adam and Eve sinning for all of us they sentenced us to death we were disconnected from communion we had no communion with God amen amen and God in his love in God in his love instead of killing Adam and Eve he killed two sheep two Lambs and made them dress with these skins to cover their sin that was God's provided way back then that's right so I have a lot of quotes here and I don't want to just read here I'd rather illustrate brother brandham talks about a man called Blind B mayus and I really did not know this about him but it says that blind Bas was uh on the street and he had a a mug and two Turtle does and it says one day his daughter got sick and he offered those doves as a sacrifice to heal his daughter and then his wife got sick and blind B mayus had a lamb back then they didn't have dogs back then to guide the Blind and his wife got sick and barus walking up the street um I think it was uh the high priest Caiaphas he begins to say where are you going and barame says I'm going to the temple to sacrifice my lamb he says I promis the Lord if he'd heal my wife I would give my lamb and says you can't give that lamp that's your walking lamp buy lamps from the sellers outside of the temple H I'm sorry buy lamps from the sellers and sacrifice that one but Bame said I promis him my lamb he said I promis him this lamb his walking guiding lamb then brother brandham says I wonder if we've made promises like that he says and if you see the all sufficient lamp tonight he says Lord if you'll get me well I will serve you I will do everything I can if you let my baby live if you if you'll let my baby live we make promises like that but let us be like barus I promised him this one then brother brandham says he went up and offered his lamb and they would still tell him you can't do that have any of you sacrific something so big and and they tell you don't do that you can't do it can't let it go Hallelujah he said yes I know but I promis God and God will provide a lamb for blind B's eyes wow Glory you have to put yourself in barda's shoes here Isaac here Alex here Alex we need to sacrifice something but we have to trust in God that God will provide again for us like our pastor was saying we have a cheap mind a poor mind a scarce mind we want to hold on to what we have we cannot think abundantly like our God brother brandham says and I want to read this paragraph 66 in English 66 I'm sorry not long after that after he had sacrificed his lamb God had provided the lamb for blind bed May's eyes he came along the street he said what's all this noise there's usually noise where where he's at is there noise where Jesus is there should be noise in this place noise of Thanksgiving he says what's all this noise he said one Jesus of Nazareth passed by he threw down his coat [Applause] not looking where it went he didn't care then God had provided a lamb he got right to the lamb he said oh Jesus thou son of David hopefully we can look at the sacrifice tonight and say have mercy of me have mercy of me the rich people and those who stood around to get close to the prophet to the king he said Oh Be Still he can't hear you oh when the devil tells you that you're too far that you're too far from God that you're out of reach that you're too low he cried that much more he cried that much more sometimes we're the opposite we dwindle we stop Yes we let people silence us are we not Royal [Music] seed that we're not burst out of royal bloodas God provided that lamb I'd like to make my third comparison with brother brandham he says in the message perfection it's going to be uh 11 okay in English in English it says although the Old Testament they offered the blood of Lamb's and goats sheep bulls and heers is um toos I don't have it here yeah just keep going a substitutionary death but all in the great economy of God listen there was back in his mind the real object coming so all these sacrifices of animals were types of the real sacrifice to come notice he says in God's Great economy I wonder how great it is to satisfy your thirst your hunger how rich is God nothing in this world can satisfy us but thank God that he can says and the real object was to come was his only begotten son all the Lambs that died was only a shadow and a shadow is only the negative side of an object and they only spoke wow Eden only spoke Eden Eden the Garden of Eden after the fall only spoke of Calvary the calvary coming he says in paragraph 25 and he's already judged does this calm anybody tonight is in this good news and he's already judged you don't have to worry about judgments as I turn and look at the little crucifix I realize that it represents his body and now that body has already been judged God can't justly judge it again for it's already judged God struck the judgments of of death upon that body wow I don't want to be judged and this is what we have to do and as long as I can find a way to get hid in that body this should make us cry brother get to our [Music] knees his judgment was struck for [Music] me for me and for you we are free the prophet says we are free Romans 81 said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus this is the key write it down that walk not after the flesh that walk not after the flesh what do we walk after but after the spirit living in the spirit not in the flesh there you are he says no condemnation I don't care what comes or what goes I don't care what comes or what goes we have to not care that's the problem we care too much we care too much what comes and goes he says you are HID you are HID beneath the blood no matter what comes or goes don't care care about that don't care about here this is not our home pilate told Jesus at the Judgment seat pilot why don't you send your angels to come save you why don't you that's a good question check the answer he says I could call my father he didn't want to make a show there he said I could call my father but this is not my kingdom my kingdom will come he didn't care about this world he was silent and he took it like a champ he finished the mission and he walked straight up with one goal in his mind to buy the children of God I'm G be I'm sorry I was going to close but my time is up God bless [Applause] you God bless everyone if you just stand for a few moments and uh just open your Bibles uh to uh you just open to the Book of John um John 14 verse 28 and 29 it's good to be in the house of the Lord uh John 14 verse 28 and 29 reads like this says you have heard heard how I said unto you I go away and come again unto you says if you loved me you would Rejoice because I said I go into the father my father is greater than I says and now I have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass you might believe uh you may be seated uh it's a good Friday amen before I get started you know I just uh want to um just want to share a little bit of uh the wapan trip and uh you know it was it's always special U you know I I I personally feel that uh you know every time you go on a trip or as the years go by uh because the work isn't just inan but there's work here as well amen but I believe as the years go by uh the the um the love that you have for the Lord's work uh should uh continually uh you know uh grow you know you should have that desire uh more and more every year uh you know that's when you really know uh that the Lord is is growing in you that the love that you have uh you know for his people uh it's it's a sign you know it's something that that just you just can't you just can't not go uh you just uh there's something in you you you may be left you know in you may not have a dime left in the bank but that's okay uh because uh that's not going to stop me it shouldn't stop you uh for doing something for the Lord uh we should continually do it and you know that's why we do it you know we had a great time uh you know I just it was it was very special and uh you know the Lord uh we we uh got two more souls for the Lord amen and you know uh we're just we're just snatching them from the devil you know we're just bringing them back and it just brings me great joy uh you know and you just snatch him from the devil's hands you know just just when he thought he had them just when he thought that they were his trophies uh you know the the Lord uh the Lord did the work you know and and uh and you know he's Victorious amen uh but uh going back uh you know and God bless the brothers for their efforts as well everything they do for us just it's just uh you could feel it you know they give you their heart and I believe that you know the Lord has a great reward for them as well God bless them uh but when we uh talk about you know a good Friday uh you know I I I was uh I was just kind of meditating and uh you know being it being that it's Friday uh you know most the time you use service and uh you know uh but I was thinking you know uh I've always asked I've always asked myself I personally always ask myself questions and uh I'm like what's so good what was so good about Good Friday you know what what what's what is Good Friday you know some of the popular beliefs one is is that uh one of the answers that I found is that it's the time of Jesus's crucifixion says it may have referred to Holy instead of good uh so you know that that's one of the thoughts behind that you know another one is that you know because Jesus couldn't have been resurrected without dying since the day of his death is in a sense a good it says that terrible Friday that has been called a good Friday because it led to the resurrection of Jesus and his victory over death and sin and and you know that's the very Pinnacle of Christ of Christian celebration or it's the peak of it you know that that that you know he obtained the victory amen you know another one is is that you know good that good in Good Friday uh it was it was derived from from God's Friday uh the you know the that's that's what some people believe oh you know and I I believe you know every day is God's day it wasn't just a good Friday uh but you know any day could be God's day uh but this was this was uh this was just a preparation of something better of something better that was coming you know and I know you know the youth you know because I've asked myself the same question it's like man how could uh suffering how could pain you know how could uh you know all these uh the the mocking you know and and and you know getting spit on H how could that be something good how could it be uh you know but I believe you know it was Good Friday because this was the beginning this was the beginning of something better uh this is where Jesus died you see because Jesus said oh you know after he he he uh he had the vinegar poured in his mouth he said it is finished but you know I believe that that was only the beginning of something better that was to come amen amen now if you can type that if you can type that oh you know death you know death begins right here it begins at the altar so you know if you want if you want to see something better you need to come to the altar because after death it only it only opens the scene for you it opens it up for you amen that's what I believe it opens up the scene yes amen that's what that's exactly what it does so uh when we talk about these things you know and brother Isaac was talking about you know the sacrifice you know and uh and and you know obviously you know in order for there to be a sacrifice you know there has to be there has to be a love for something not not only do they go call it good Friday but they also call it passion Friday that's right you know uh when you have passion for something uh you know it just just stimulate something inside of you you know and when you love God oh you know it just it just does something to you there's just a there's just a passion inside you you see you can you can love a lot of things and not have them amen amen how many believe that you know there's people that love money oh but they don't have it oh there's people that love cars oh they love houses or they love their phones or they just they just love so many things and they wish they had it but I'm going to tell you something you can love God and if you love him you can have them you can you can have God if you love them I don't believe there's a person here that if they have true love for God and not have him but if you love him you can have him he's yours you can have his promises you can have his healing you can have his Deliverance you just ask ask him whatever you want if you love him or you can have them and I thank Judas for that I thank Judas for that because like I've said before and we can learn something from him because Judas Judas didn't give him a fake a fake Jesus was not the fake Jesus but he gave them the real thing and that's what the people want they want the real Jesus they want the real Jesus they want him there's a Russian proverb Russo R and it says this it says I'd rather be slapped in the face with the truth than given a kiss with a lie amen amen sometimes I believe you know when you come to church are how many want to hear a lie we come to hear the truth and sometimes you got to get slapped around and Jesus got slapped like you know and he and it it was for a cause and it was a good cause and I want to tell you that that cause is right here uh the reason that that you're here the reason Jesus got slapped the reason he got mocked the reason he got spit on was the passion that he had for his children I believe that we can't see it many times we don't understand it uh you know there's been so many things in my life and I just failed to understand them but you know I want to tell you that as you grow in the Lord as you grow in the things of God as you begin to sacrifice as you begin to let go of things uh that that is when God begins to open your eyes you begin to see that what you thought was evil it actually worked out for the good you know thought that's one of the St scriptures that I always clung to I didn't quite understand it but I memorized it and when something appeared to be bad when it it didn't make sense to me when it didn't make sense to me I would repeat that verse and we know that all things work together for the good but to those who love God but to those who are the called according to his purpose you know and that's the thing when you love them and your eyes your eyes begin to open up and you begin to see the God's Redemptive plan and you begin to see that just the coming to church there's actually a purpose behind it oh brother brandham says this he says this in the message God talked to Moses he says preaching healing preaching all God's Redemptive blessings he's here tonight his spirit's here his glory is here his power is here his Joy is here his love is here his power is here his spirit's here his servants are here his word is here he is here himself everything that he died for is here for you it's here for you or you can grab hold of it you don't have to leave empty-handed or you can take whatever you want God's not going to run out he let let the spirit go he let the spirit go see we got to let go but Jesus gave up the spirit he he gave it up that was part of the plan you got to let go amen amen how many believe that Hallelujah I believe it with all my heart see it may have appeared evil the crucifixion at the moment all his disciples and even whenever we when things don't go our way when when things don't go as planned cuz we all we all have some kind of story that's going on in our head even the [Music] adults not just talking about the youth we all have something in our mind the way that things are supposed to be played out you got the characters and everything crucifixion was happening before that crucifixion there was there was they they released one prisoner that's right one prisoner would be released amen and uh you know the people that you know uh they uh they called they wanted Barabas they who should we set free a Barabas or Jesus and you know I believe at that moment not a single one raised their hand for Jesus not a single one you know we live in a time of where people they'd rather deal with a drunker a drug addict a thief a murderer oh they'd rather deal with somebody like that are they with Jesus they they don't want anything to do with them I hope that's not the case I hope that's not the case tonight now we're talking about a release I'm closing now but when we talk about this release there was one person that would be let go and you know maybe uh maybe Barabas didn't know what was happening maybe at that moment he had just heard of Jesus faintly you know maybe somebody testifying but uh [Music] you know uh maybe he heard the jailers come in and they said Barabas you're free you're you're free to you're you're free to go and uh perhabs didn't understand he didn't understand what was happening he was probably like what how how is this and he steps out you know they releases the [Music] shackles from his hands and feet and maybe as he walked out of the prison he said who who who set me free and he looked up he looked up to Mount Calvary and he saw Jesus and they said that man right there that man that man carrying the cross that one that was Carri your sins the one that carried your guilt the one that carried your shame the one that carried it all he's the reason that you were free you're free to go I tell you this evening church you are free you're free to worship you're free to praise him you're free to serve them or be free be free tonight don't wait till tomorrow but you can be free he set you free you don't have to leave in bondage you don't have to leave in sin you don't have to leave in the same condition that you came in you can be free tonight you may say I don't understand you don't have to oh you don't have to feel it oh you you just got to believe it you just got to believe what he said many don't believe [Music] you may say Lord I want to believe Lord help my unbelief the Lord will help you he'll help you in your unbelief he'll help you in your circumstances he'll help you when you don't understand when you don't understand what's going on I want to tell you just know this that all things work for the good to them that love God to those that are called according to his purpose believe it believe it with all your heart like I said he said it was finished the work of Jesus was finished but he had to release the spirit because he knew that there was going to be somebody that was going to receive it even if it was just a little bit that little bit I can feel that empty heart it can release those chains of bondage that little bit can do a lot not cuz I heard it but because I've seen it because I've been a witness I've been a witness of his power I've been a witness of his resurrection can I get a witness tonight witness here the true witness is here he's here to receive you that empty heart can leave full the altar is open God bless
