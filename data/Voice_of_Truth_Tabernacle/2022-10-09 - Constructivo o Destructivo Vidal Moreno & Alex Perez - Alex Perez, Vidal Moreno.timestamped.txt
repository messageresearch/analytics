[27:34] let's read the Scripture
[27:36] it says in the following way
[27:46] in heart and with all thy soul and with
[27:49] all thy might yes
[27:55] and these words shall I command thee
[27:57] this day shall be in thine heart is
[28:10] diligently unto thy children and talk of
[28:13] them when thou cities in thine house and
[28:15] when that walk is by the by the way and
[28:18] why that when thou lie is down and when
[28:19] thou Rises up is
[28:27] and thou shall bind them for a sign upon
[28:30] thine hand and they shall be as
[28:32] frontless between thine eyes
[28:37] and now shall write them upon the post
[28:40] of thy house and on thy Gates
[28:47] chapter 1 verse 5
[28:52] it says in the following way
[29:07] yes
[29:09] when I call to remembrance the unfeigned
[29:12] faith that is in thee which dwelt first
[29:14] in thy grandmother Lois and then thy
[29:17] mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in
[29:19] thee also
[29:20] um
[29:27] we're so thankful with you Lord
[29:30] for the privilege that you give us
[29:33] to be in your presence
[29:36] so come here words of life
[29:42] because they're your words lord they're
[29:45] not of men
[29:46] they're inspired by you father
[29:49] and we asked
[29:53] you look upon the needs of your people
[29:56] you look at their hearts
[29:59] you respond according to
[30:26] Alex I'm here to share the word with our
[30:29] brother Alex
[30:30] and as a title
[30:32] um
[30:34] we've placed
[30:36] um
[30:40] constructive or destructive
[30:45] one has a family
[30:48] restaurant
[30:51] we're speaking about restoring the
[30:53] family
[30:56] when one has a home
[31:00] family
[31:05] there's always going to be an atmosphere
[31:07] in a home
[31:42] in the morning he spoke a little bit on
[31:44] environment
[31:52] that where the animals are placed
[31:55] where the animals are placed because
[32:00] not even the animals
[32:05] where they were going to be placed
[32:09] all that
[32:21] so that they can live in that
[32:24] environment amen amen
[32:30] but when we return to what a home is
[32:38] you can see that environment whether
[32:40] it's constructive or destructive
[33:41] I could have everything
[33:43] foreign
[35:05] in that atmosphere
[35:54] I believe that Brothers
[36:41] what am I going to do with them
[36:44] who's dead because you
[36:46] um
[36:52] you're going to be the ones that are
[36:54] going to demand your children amen I
[36:57] believe that brothers
[36:59] and the way that they are
[37:03] they are the way they are because of the
[37:05] way you've taught them amen amen
[37:08] and it's the truth
[37:14] when we speak about the home
[37:16] you
[37:19] have to ask yourself the question okay
[37:24] what environment or atmosphere
[37:27] am I creating for my children
[37:31] um
[37:34] testimonial I say this as a testimony
[37:38] I grew up in a home
[37:42] there was a lot of violence
[37:47] and also physical violence
[37:52] so I learned from a young age
[37:55] what all of that was
[37:57] um
[38:00] there's a lot of things that have
[38:01] remained in my mind
[38:06] a lot of our children haven't seen
[38:09] but they stayed there
[38:12] and a lot of times although one might or
[38:14] you might try to forget them
[38:17] it's difficult
[38:21] but I remember seeing my mother
[38:26] and in tears
[38:30] and as a child
[38:48] um
[38:51] and trying to tell you that everything
[38:53] was going to be okay
[38:57] I'm being having experience with those
[38:59] things
[39:00] I've seen them personally firsthand um
[39:05] I could have gone angry with God
[39:11] and have told them if there's a God then
[39:13] why does this happen
[39:15] why do these things happen if God is so
[39:18] good
[39:20] and I don't understand
[39:23] foreign
[40:37] foreign see I don't know what if they
[40:40] didn't teach them
[40:41] they didn't teach them
[40:45] they only show what they've been taught
[40:49] so many times they're they're not at
[40:51] fault completely right
[40:55] so let's learn from them
[40:58] rather than judge them amen amen
[41:04] I'm going to read a quote from them
[41:07] from Brother Branham
[41:09] foreign
[41:31] ER
[41:45] and I think it's a good thing that we
[41:47] put every effort we can before our
[41:49] children as Godly Parents
[41:53] make an example
[41:55] be an example amen amen
[42:00] many times we don't realize
[42:03] the importance of
[42:06] setting an example
[42:12] the children aren't going to learn me
[42:14] ties just by hearing
[42:15] but I personally
[42:19] personally speaking
[42:23] I'm not one of those people that can
[42:25] read something and then know how to do
[42:27] it
[42:28] without having some kind of an image
[42:33] for someone to show me how to do things
[42:37] speak about what the Christian Life Is
[42:41] But if we don't see a Christian life
[42:45] then many times
[42:49] we can't learn what's good
[42:52] is
[43:02] but we're always lowering our children's
[43:05] self-esteems
[43:07] they they can't identify
[43:09] but right on the country
[43:16] and
[43:21] many times they can't recover from that
[43:25] believe that God can do all things
[43:29] I come to the house of God when I come
[43:32] to life
[43:33] I always come in expectations
[43:37] [Applause]
[43:45] [Applause]
[43:50] [Applause]
[44:27] [Applause]
[44:46] I'll go
[44:49] perhaps a man promised himself
[44:59] man is going to fail you
[45:01] for God and no fire he doesn't fail
[45:04] Brothers
[45:05] amen amen
[45:09] he said he was going to help us
[45:19] it doesn't matter where you live
[45:22] and whether it's a trailer or a Home
[45:26] doesn't matter what kind of a car you
[45:28] have
[45:29] God is good
[45:30] it doesn't matter if you don't have a
[45:32] question God continues
[45:37] as long as I can hear him God is good
[45:40] Brothers amen amen amen
[45:46] foreign
[45:54] when you want to build or edify someone
[45:58] is important it's important to recognize
[46:04] look at um with that person
[46:08] is going through
[46:11] this is
[46:14] I know that there are many sarcastic
[46:17] people out there
[46:21] and there's sometimes that people aren't
[46:23] enough for the sarcastic yes
[46:29] no one realizes that the person's
[46:32] already
[47:20] [Music]
[47:25] there is so much negativity
[48:17] with the child of God
[48:21] I'm going to read another another uh
[48:24] quote
[48:27] brother Brandon says this he said
[48:32] yes
[48:35] now when God gets rich and deep down
[48:37] here
[48:41] see more of God get you get down in
[48:44] there
[48:46] the more you'll believe God
[48:49] because there's more of him
[48:53] and the more you cultivate this down
[48:55] here
[48:56] the more you can believe God
[49:02] it's just like a child when he's a
[49:04] little bitty fellas
[49:07] maybe he doesn't know very much about it
[49:10] foreign
[49:34] from my Earthly parent amen amen
[49:42] be giving the place to my brother Alex
[49:47] but Brothers I encourage you uh
[49:59] I you know
[50:01] we're going to start there brother
[50:04] yes
[50:06] that is where the child receives
[50:12] my most important things that he can
[50:14] learn
[50:17] to know how to instruct them and lead
[50:20] him in the ways of God
[50:24] what happens behind those four walls of
[50:27] that home
[50:28] when the door is closed
[50:36] that's what determines how the children
[50:38] are going to live out in the real world
[50:42] rebounds off of those four walls
[50:48] because there's going to be an echo in
[50:50] the heart of the children
[50:54] what are they going to be hearing in
[50:56] that Echo okay
[50:59] that's the question I ask you
[51:02] are there going to be words of life
[51:08] or is it going to be something
[51:09] destructive
[51:11] I can go and destroy it everywhere
[51:15] that's what happens in in the home
[51:19] what's going to be what's going to
[51:21] manifest
[51:22] God bless you amazing
[51:30] Hermanos God bless you Brothers

[51:36] and open your Bibles in the Book of Luke

[53:40] just read yes and this is what he says
[53:46] and he says and today you know that love
[53:49] is something that's so difficult to find
[53:54] foreign
[53:59] the Bible says that there come a time
[54:01] when there wouldn't be love for one
[54:03] another
[54:06] that the father would be against the
[54:08] mother
[54:10] as it is
[54:12] what the father would be against the
[54:14] mother is
[54:15] the mother against the fathers
[54:19] and the children against their parents
[54:22] Ikea

[55:57] home
[56:00] there's division there's a division in
[56:03] the home
[56:06] the Bible says in Deuteronomy chapters
[56:08] foreign
[56:59] and he tells him something else
[57:10] don't have
[57:25] God will be the foundation
[57:29] God will be in all of your life
[57:37] and in verse 6 he says in these words
[57:40] shall I command thee this day shall be
[57:41] in thine heart eleven

[58:07] I he had his children the son was

[58:37] that you have to love God
[58:40] imagine

[59:38] another race
[59:47] as God told him that they have to be

[1:04:07] you say
[1:04:09] this is
[1:04:15] the type of home that uh that a person
[1:04:18] has in there
[1:04:20] it will affect them for the rest of
[1:04:23] their lives
[1:04:31] because I believe in the grace of God
[1:04:34] but it does influence
[1:04:37] how a young man

[1:05:33] here's an example
[1:05:45] here is an example of how the parents
[1:05:48] that went to church influenced the
[1:05:50] future of their children

[1:07:58] the Christian Life
[1:08:03] or continue
[1:08:06] are you with me
[1:08:09] let's turn a corner
[1:08:12] I want to finish by telling you about
[1:08:15] Josiah is
[1:08:18] a very impressive very impressive young
[1:08:22] man in the Bible
[1:08:27] he was the youngest king
[1:08:30] that that the people of Judah had
[1:08:34] a division that there was with Israel
[1:08:42] of age
[1:08:46] and now the father of Josiah his name
[1:08:49] was Ammon
[1:08:51] he was an idolater
[1:08:54] it's Gucci
[1:08:56] he was an idolatry
[1:08:59] because the father of Josiah
[1:09:06] the grand the grandfather of Josephine
[1:09:09] was Manassas
[1:09:16] Josiah's grandfather
[1:09:20] he was one of the worst kings that Judah
[1:09:23] has
[1:09:24] in fact it says
[1:09:29] you know what this guy did
[1:09:37] children
[1:09:44] this man was tremendous in his reign
[1:09:49] s
[1:09:49] he took away our worship
[1:09:53] and he grabbed a hold of horses he
[1:09:58] was one of the worst kings that Israel
[1:10:02] had
[1:10:06] had an option
[1:10:15] to follow what his uh what his uh
[1:10:18] ancestors
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:57] says
[1:11:07] I was eight years old
[1:11:15] I was eight years old when he began to
[1:11:17] Reign he reigned 30 and one years in
[1:11:18] Jerusalem
[1:11:19] and this captured my attention
[1:11:23] he had his
[1:11:25] yeah
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:39] a good example for them
[1:11:43] your children and know you better than
[1:11:45] the pastors

[1:12:03] they know why I haven't eaten is
[1:12:11] no cinnamon because they know us right
[1:12:16] but it captures my attention to this
[1:12:18] young man
[1:12:20] establish because every youth is looking
[1:12:24] for a guy a mentor to follow right
[1:12:29] Josiah was eight years old
[1:12:32] and I imagine
[1:12:35] yeah

[1:12:48] he said who am I going to follow
[1:12:57] how am I gonna live my life

[1:13:08] they live more tremendously am I going
[1:13:11] to follow there am I going to follow
[1:13:14] them
[1:13:15] may God help us
[1:13:19] not perfect
[1:13:21] with at least good beginnings

[1:13:48] and he did what was right in the sight
[1:13:52] of the Lord

[1:33:50] and they have let themselves be guided
[1:33:52] they have been obedient is
[1:33:57] and sometimes they've been a sculptures
[1:34:01] but they have received the correction
[1:34:04] and that is the beautiful thing
[1:34:06] for a pastor
[1:34:09] and also for the parents the same way
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:20] as well
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] they can tell sister everyone to come
[1:34:31] forward as well yesterday
[1:34:37] um
[1:34:39] presentation I do things differently in
[1:34:42] every presentation
[1:34:43] and I let myself be guided by the Holy
[1:34:46] Spirit
[1:34:47] and I am happy to have him
[1:34:50] at the parents
[1:34:53] that their children have put an effort
[1:34:56] in it
[1:34:58] and they love the God above all things
[1:35:01] important I believe that's the most
[1:35:03] important thing that they love the Lord
[1:35:06] and they want to serve the Lord together
[1:35:09] they have they have the same purpose
[1:35:12] to serve the Lord
[1:35:17] the other day that I got together with
[1:35:19] the adult youth is
[1:35:26] what goals what goals do you have
[1:35:31] and our brother Fernando and Sister
[1:35:33] Alyssa
[1:35:34] they have the desire
[1:35:37] to help other youths
[1:35:39] to be used by God
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:45] and I know God is going to fulfill these
[1:35:47] desires for them
[1:35:49] so God has great things
[1:35:52] and I believe the whole church is happy
[1:35:56] and they're happy for them foreign
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:05] I believe he has the ring right
[1:36:08] [Music]
[1:36:14] a ring is a promise
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:19] God created a ring in the sky in the
[1:36:23] heaven
[1:36:25] the rainbow is a symbol of a ring
[1:36:31] from the point of the earth it seems
[1:36:33] like like a half circle
[1:36:36] but they always take when they say
[1:36:39] so when they take pictures from the
[1:36:41] space from space The Rainbows are a
[1:36:44] circle yes
[1:36:47] that's that's the symbol that God gave
[1:36:50] to humanity Humanity
[1:36:53] for a promise that he that he has done
[1:36:55] that
[1:36:58] and I believe that the Bible shows us
[1:37:03] so when someone gets engaged or promises
[1:37:07] or engage
[1:37:09] and so where not be broken
[1:37:12] you cannot back up
[1:37:15] that's why they make sure before that uh
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:22] so when they get engaged
[1:37:25] before the goal before the Lord they're
[1:37:28] officially almost married
[1:37:32] that's why when Mary was promised to
[1:37:34] Joseph
[1:37:38] he had to give her a divorcement if he
[1:37:40] was not going to marry her
[1:37:43] so and legally in the Bible when they
[1:37:45] get engaged before God
[1:37:48] there is no way of backing out
[1:37:54] of course you have to wait till the
[1:37:56] ceremony comes
[1:37:58] and
[1:38:01] behave themselves
[1:38:03] there is
[1:38:05] but I believe that they're going to do
[1:38:07] it
[1:38:10] they're going to give their word before
[1:38:12] them as you're with you being their
[1:38:15] witness because
[1:38:16] that they're getting engaged to each and
[1:38:19] every one
[1:38:20] another before God
[1:38:23] that they're going to get married
[1:38:26] um
[1:38:29] whether you put the ring on her that's
[1:38:31] okay and just say after me
[1:38:35] uh you can say
[1:38:38] Alyssa Alyssa rometto I promise
[1:38:44] that I will marry you I will marry you
[1:38:46] know in the name of the Lord Jesus
