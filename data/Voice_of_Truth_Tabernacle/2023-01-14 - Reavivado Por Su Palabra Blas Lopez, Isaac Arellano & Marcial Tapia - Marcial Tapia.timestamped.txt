[20:44] themselves together and came to Samuel
[20:46] and tirama and said unto him behold thou
[20:49] are old and thy Sons walk not in thy
[20:51] ways now make us a king to judge us as
[20:54] like all the nations
[20:57] foreign
[21:59] foreign
[23:10] hands of God
[23:26] and the people of Israel
[23:29] Dios
[23:44] they didn't want to live like God had
[23:46] acquired of them
[23:50] or they live they want to live like the
[23:53] rest
[23:53] as the world lives
[24:00] in the church these days

[24:33] good Brothers
[24:40] is
[25:05] uh
[25:07] uh
[25:07] in the message rejected key now I took
[25:10] this quote and it says like this
[25:16] the people were a great deal
[25:27] they had come to a place and on the
[25:32] world
[25:36] to replace the wine to be like other
[25:38] people
[25:40] they want to be like other people
[25:45] that is just simply a nature with peace
[25:59] each other
[26:02] they say if you'll go out and buy he
[26:05] says
[26:12] and go buy a certain kind of clothing
[26:16] or a certain cars
[26:20] paint your steps a certain color in your
[26:22] house or on your steps
[26:25] they say okay says watch the neighbor
[26:31] you just can't stand it
[26:37] blessed be the Lord
[26:43] we have to live the life
[26:48] that's what people want to see nowadays
[26:54] with their life
[26:57] people in these times Brothers
[27:05] vanity
[27:30] that will remain in this world
[27:36] because
[27:49] it has to be the Lord
[27:58] you come with a certain type of hat they
[28:01] say
[28:04] that's a little different
[28:06] that's a little different next Sunday
[28:15] you'll have a lot of sisters with that
[28:17] same kind of hat she said
[28:42] blessed be the Lord
[28:45] they say
[28:53] sisters
[29:02] but these people in the downstairs
[29:17] they saw the Philistines
[29:23] and the unbelieving is
[29:32] and they say we want to be like them
[29:35] what a mistake
[29:42] I've already seen all of his promises
[29:53] Hermanos
[30:02] Prophet says
[30:08] that that that food over here
[30:23] is the same
[30:26] blessed be the Lord
[30:28] God is good
[30:40] it's a human mind
[30:48] I saw what happened in the in the days
[30:51] of Adam
[30:52] [Applause]
[30:54] wanted to cover him it didn't work
[30:58] foreign
[31:19] [Music]
[31:45] [Music]
[32:13] it's helping my spiritual life
[32:16] foreign
[33:27] see
[33:32] in those four minutes
[33:34] I want to tell you
[33:37] okay
[33:40] just as I'm doing that fast
[33:43] that is helping me
[33:50] that if you haven't taken it this year
[33:56] propose yourself
[34:08] many times I'm scared of being here
[34:12] the prophet says
[34:16] obedience to the words
[34:26] I don't want to be the same
[34:31] I want to be a child
[34:38] foreign
[35:13] foreign
[36:13] foreign
[36:20] God bless you Brothers
[36:23] if you can turn with me to First Samuel
[36:26] verse 1.
[36:32] and our title for tonight is quickened
[36:35] by his word
[36:39] or revive by his word
[36:43] [Music]
[36:45] amen as you're turning I'm just gonna
[36:47] give a little introduction you know
[36:49] what's going on
[36:53] God bless our brother and
[36:57] uh the Philistines were the foes of
[37:00] Israel in this time is
[37:11] and they were in constant conflict
[37:16] Israel usually got the worst of it
[37:21] and the Philistines had already entered
[37:24] into the Iron Age
[37:40] so the Philistines were had Superior
[37:43] weapons
[37:50] and the Philistines have been oppressing
[37:52] the people of israelisters
[37:57] so Israel was crying to the Lord
[38:03] now in all of the churches
[38:07] Samuel was the last
[38:11] and we find out he's established as a
[38:14] spiritual leader
[38:17] spiritual and now we'll begin reading
[38:20] verse one of Samuel 7.
[38:25] and I'm going to ask you to be following
[38:27] me because we're going to read 12 verses
[38:35] amen and it says and the men of kirith
[38:38] Jerome came and fetched up the Ark of
[38:40] the Lord and brought it into the house
[38:41] of abimindab in the hill and Sanctified
[38:44] Eliezer his son to keep the Ark of the
[38:46] Lord
[39:07] that the time was long for it was 20
[39:10] years and all the house of Israel
[39:12] lamented after the Lord
[39:23] so chapter five and
[39:27] sixes houses that the sons of Eli took
[39:30] the ark into
[39:32] battles
[39:37] and the Philistines conquered the ark
[39:39] enes
[39:43] and Eli's children died in battle
[39:48] and then a couple details of Phyllis
[39:51] signs got hemorrhoids and they were
[39:52] dealing with rats and other diseases
[40:05] tomorrow and they realize that so that
[40:09] they had the ark and the Ark of God
[40:11] decapitated their God
[40:18] Dios
[40:56] Solo solo was able to deliver himself
[41:03] without anybody's help
[41:07] that gets me excited God doesn't need
[41:09] help amen
[41:13] now chapter 7 is a transition chapter
[41:20] God has spoken to Samuels the people's
[41:25] hearts are breaking
[41:29] because they're not satisfied with the
[41:32] corruption
[41:35] and they're aching for a relationship
[41:37] with God yes
[41:41] and then verse three reads
[41:44] and Samuel speaking to other house of
[41:47] Israel saying if you do return unto the
[41:49] Lord with all your hearts then put away
[41:51] the strange gods and ashrath from among
[41:54] you and prepare your hearts unto the
[41:55] Lord and serve him only and he will
[41:57] deliver you out of the hand of
[41:59] Philistines
[42:07] foreign
[42:42] and turn back to the Lord
[42:46] no more
[42:49] no more of we have the Lord and we serve
[42:52] another Lord
[42:57] no more of doing both things
[43:08] the Lord will be the only one you serve
[43:11] okay
[43:14] and then God will deliver you
[43:18] so verse 4 says then the children of
[43:20] Israel did put away Balaam and asheroth
[43:23] and serve the Lord only
[43:31] so now verse 5 they're gonna have a
[43:34] gathering of the Nations
[43:50] and verse 5 says
[43:53] and Samuel said gather all Israel to
[43:56] miss but I will pray for you unto the
[43:58] Lord
[43:59] this is
[44:08] and Drew water and poured it out before
[44:10] the Lord and fasted on the day and said
[44:12] we have sinned against the Lord and
[44:14] Samuel judged the children of Israel in
[44:16] mizpah is
[44:32] so the nation is rededicating their
[44:35] lives in this place
[44:39] it's a national repentance
[44:44] they're all confessing their sins
[44:48] to the Lord and now here's the action in
[44:51] verse 7.
[44:56] and when the Philistines her that the
[44:59] children of Israel we're gathered
[45:00] together to Mitzvah the Lords of
[45:03] Philistines went up against Israel so a
[45:05] Revival is happening a great meeting oh
[45:08] forgive me go ahead
[45:17] so there's a Revival happening
[45:21] the entire nation is in one spot
[45:26] they're all assembled
[45:29] and they're vulnerable it is
[45:33] foreign
[45:49] that's right and when the children of
[45:51] Israel heard it they were afraid of the
[45:53] Philistines
[45:55] so why were they afraid of the
[45:57] Philistines
[45:59] a number of things
[46:02] the Philistines had unmatched weapons
[46:09] Israel was not in the Iron Age yet
[46:14] the Philistines are chariots
[46:19] and their technology was against them
[46:24] another thing
[46:26] Israel was not meeting
[46:30] for a war meeting
[46:48] and when you think about going to church
[46:54] when we come to church
[46:56] we don't think about bringing a gun or a
[46:59] bat no pensamos
[47:03] or a weapon
[47:06] they're coming we come to confess our
[47:08] sins
[47:10] and here they're coming to turn to the
[47:12] lord
[47:16] they're having a spiritual focused
[47:18] events
[47:21] and the enemy comes
[47:25] at the same event
[47:28] with weapons
[47:30] and Israel is unarmed
[47:34] [Music]
[47:37] this this backstory is very powerful
[47:40] esta Historia is I can just take it for
[47:44] today if somebody's waiting for us
[47:46] outside
[47:48] so verse 8 says
[47:51] and the children of Israel said to
[47:54] Samuel sees not to cry unto the Lord Our
[47:56] God for us that he will save us out of
[47:58] the hand of the Philistines the
[48:08] relational
[49:08] foreign
[49:40] offering holy unto the Lord and Samuel
[49:42] Cried unto the Lord for Israel and the
[49:44] Lord heard him this is
[49:59] so he offers a sacrifice
[50:03] and then praise
[50:05] and that was that was their action yes
[50:10] that was that was what they did
[50:16] that's that's wild for me
[50:21] verse 9 says the Lord heard him
[50:26] but how did God hear them
[50:30] and verse 10 says
[50:32] and Samuel was offering up the burnt
[50:35] offering
[51:01] and it keeps saying but the Lord
[51:03] thundered with a great Thunder on that
[51:05] day upon the Philistines and
[51:07] discomforted them and they were smitten
[51:09] before the Lord for Israel
[51:53] they realized something bigger was
[51:55] happening
[51:59] the Philistines realize something bigger
[52:01] was happening
[52:04] they said we're in trouble now
[52:07] so what did Israel do to make this
[52:10] happen
[52:12] confess their sins
[52:14] turn away from idols
[52:18] and rededicated their lives to God
[52:23] and say and said I'm gonna destroy them
[52:28] while they pray
[52:31] and God wipes out their enemy with a
[52:34] noise
[52:37] and verse 12 says
[52:40] this is the main point of this reading
[52:44] principal then Samuel took her son and
[52:47] said it between mispo and Shannon called
[52:49] the name of it Ebenezer saying hitherto
[52:51] hath the Lord helped us is
[53:19] and the message is that the Lord helps
[53:22] us
[53:24] the Lord has helped us
[53:28] God helps those who can't help
[53:30] themselves
[53:33] God helps people that cry out
[53:37] God helps people that are in trouble
[53:41] and God helps people that confess my
[53:44] brother was saying
[53:48] think of Samson's son who pulled down a
[53:52] temple
[53:54] on himself and killed the majority of
[53:57] Philistines
[54:00] in his death and somewhere then in his
[54:03] life
[54:05] and Samuel without a battle is
[54:10] without military
[54:13] had a prayer meeting
[54:18] and that wiped out the Philistines
[54:22] and they put up a
[54:25] monumento that the Lord helped us
[54:29] I want to read a quote by Charles
[54:31] Spurgeon
[54:35] 1863
[54:39] it says I think we have been in similar
[54:43] circumstances
[54:51] the victory obtained was by the lamb El
[54:55] La Victoria
[54:57] as soon as the lamb was slaughtered and
[54:59] the smoke went up to heaven the blessing
[55:01] began to descend upon the Israelites
[55:12] and the curse upon the foes
[55:17] brother and if we had done anything for
[55:19] Christ
[55:21] if we have achieved any victories
[55:26] if in this house any Souls have been
[55:28] converted
[55:31] really hard Sanctified
[55:35] any trooping Spirits comforted
[55:40] their witness that it has been all
[55:42] through the lamb testifique
[55:47] when we have picture try slaughtered
[55:53] we describe the agonies
[55:58] which he endured upon the cross
[56:01] then we have tried to preach fully
[56:03] through feebly the great doctrine of
[56:06] this substitutionary sacrifice
[56:17] foreign
[57:05] you have overcome your foes
[57:09] you have slaughtered your sins
[57:12] you have mastered your troubles
[57:16] how has it been from the altar of that
[57:19] bleeding lamb this is
[57:24] the Throne of him who is to Reign
[57:26] forever and ever
[57:31] the whole Road has been stained with the
[57:34] Crimson blood of your enemies
[57:44] the lamb shall overcome
[57:48] Ebenezer hitherto the Lord hath helped
[57:51] us
[57:54] but the help has always been through the
[57:59] lambes the bleeding living and reigning
[58:02] lamp
[58:12] says a song of degrees of David it had
[58:15] been not
[58:17] if it had been
[58:19] forgive me if it had not been the Lord
[58:22] who was on our side now may Israel say
[58:28] s
[58:30] [Music]
[58:32] the Lord who was on our side when men
[58:36] rose up against us
[58:42] then they have swallowed us up quick
[58:45] when their wrath was kindled against us
[58:54] then the waters had overwhelmed us the
[58:57] stream had gone over our soul
[59:05] blessed be the Lord who have not given
[59:08] us as prey to their teeth
[59:23] our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[59:26] snare of the Fowlers and snare the snare
[59:28] is broken and we are escaped
[59:38] Nosotros our help is in the name of the
[59:41] Lord who made Heaven and Earth
[59:47] and one more scripture second
[59:50] Corinthians
[59:54] verse
[59:56] but we heard the sentence of death in
[59:59] ourselves that we should not trust in
[1:00:01] ourselves but in God which raises the
[1:00:04] Dead
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:27] who delivered us from so great a death
[1:00:30] and doth delivered in whom we trust and
[1:00:33] that he will yet Deliver Us
[1:00:38] bendiga
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:58] our Lord
[1:01:04] Grande we have a great God
[1:01:08] a God who has not left
[1:01:11] it's a pleasure to see our brothers a
[1:01:15] warrior
[1:01:17] and I just get very happy
[1:01:20] because
[1:01:28] that's your description
[1:01:32] first Samuel chapter 7 verse 3.
[1:01:36] amen
[1:01:40] let's read it this is like this is
[1:02:07] taken to all the house of Israel saying
[1:02:09] if you do not return unto the Lord with
[1:02:11] all your hearts then put away the
[1:02:12] strange God in astronauts from among you
[1:02:14] and prepare your hearts unto the Lord
[1:02:15] and serve him only and he will deliver
[1:02:17] you out of the hands of the Philistines
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:03:17] they couldn't even withstand
[1:04:16] because of the situation
[1:04:19] is
[1:05:19] Hercules
[1:06:23] to the holy things
[1:06:30] what's killing me
[1:06:34] I get too attached to the gods of this
[1:06:36] foreign
[1:07:29] I say this
[1:07:35] because I also have things I deal with
[1:07:40] and I'm not judging you Hallelujah
[1:07:44] I'm with you
[1:07:47] I know that we're in a war in a
[1:07:50] battles
[1:07:51] now that we all go through difficulties
[1:07:58] I know that we're all being hurt
[1:08:01] but I just want to tell you bro
[1:08:15] that we can use it in our time look
[1:08:18] Brothers
[1:08:19] she
[1:08:30] can have children yeah she cried out to
[1:08:33] God
[1:08:34] I believe that there are many mothers
[1:08:36] here
[1:08:41] who prayed for their children
[1:08:48] that was the life of Samuels
[1:08:52] he came through and answered
[1:08:55] now Samuel
[1:08:58] according to this
[1:09:00] he began to discover
[1:09:04] what he was called
[1:09:08] one of the questions
[1:09:12] what was I saying on this Earth foreign
[1:09:44] or manifest the work of God
[1:09:47] through you now
[1:09:53] Samuel because he fills
[1:09:56] because the Lord
[1:10:04] and he would go and check with Eli
[1:10:08] he said
[1:10:10] why have he called me
[1:10:13] I haven't called you he's welcome
[1:10:19] and the voice of God came back
[1:10:22] he called them three times four times
[1:10:30] hear that voice once again
[1:10:33] just just say back here
[1:11:03] oh yeah
[1:11:05] now what he did
[1:11:09] he heard the voice
[1:11:18] he was a judge
[1:11:22] he was the last judge that there was in
[1:11:24] at that era in that time
[1:11:27] after that would come the Kings
[1:11:32] because
[1:11:34] of the pleasures of life
[1:11:39] I've always wanted to be like the rest
[1:11:42] but the people of God
[1:11:46] we can't be like the rest
[1:11:49] although we try okay
[1:11:53] we try and force ourselves to be a part
[1:11:55] of it
[1:11:56] I had good news for you you won't be
[1:12:00] able to promise God
[1:12:17] you do away with all of those Gods
[1:12:22] let's prepare our hearts for the Lord
[1:12:25] and let's serve him only
[1:12:29] serve him
[1:12:33] the only God can give you that right and
[1:12:36] I have no doubt I have not won doubt
[1:12:39] okay
[1:12:44] I only tell you
[1:12:46] that it can be done
[1:12:49] [Music]
[1:12:53] little steps and it can be done
[1:12:57] just one step at a time
[1:13:06] because I'm a witness
[1:13:09] when I hear the voice of God when I hear
[1:13:13] my pastors
[1:13:17] God is with you
[1:13:21] let's take one step
[1:13:26] and when you do away with it
[1:13:29] do away with those Gods
[1:13:31] it can be done look
[1:13:38] Voya
[1:13:41] I'm going to read this message glory to
[1:13:43] God
[1:13:49] a true sign that's overlooked
[1:13:52] Miriam look this is
[1:13:58] whatever you do
[1:14:01] don't you forget my words
[1:14:20] that you won't forget it
[1:14:23] so don't forget it I'll see you
[1:14:26] see this saith the Lord
[1:14:30] return to God with all your hearts
[1:14:34] something that the devil hates is
[1:14:37] that a Son of God repent
[1:15:02] to repent
[1:15:05] and to get back on the path of God
[1:15:08] you always know that
[1:15:10] it doesn't matter what you decide
[1:15:14] it matters and it hurts
[1:15:16] although there will be consequences
[1:15:19] let's always have this in our minds
[1:15:24] with open arms
[1:15:56] come back
[1:15:59] don't rely upon an emotion
[1:16:01] on a sensation
[1:16:03] foreign
