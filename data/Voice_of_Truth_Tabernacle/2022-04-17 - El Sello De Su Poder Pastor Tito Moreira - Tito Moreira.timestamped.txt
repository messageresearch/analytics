[2:16] do
[2:25] this morning i like to read two more
[2:26] scripts
[2:29] so that we can place my thoughts
[2:45] and this one just ties in perfectly with
[2:47] the scriptures that we have just read
[3:27] when the unclean spirit is gone out of a
[3:29] man he walketh through dry places
[3:32] seeking rest and finding none he sayeth
[3:36] i will return unto my house once i came
[3:38] out
[3:43] and when it comes he finds it swept and
[3:46] garnished
[3:57] then go with him take us to him seven
[3:59] other spirits more wicked than himself
[4:02] and they enter in and dwell there
[4:05] and the last state of that man is worse
[4:08] than the first
[4:20] and it came to pass as he spake these
[4:22] things
[4:23] a certain woman of the company lifted up
[4:25] her voice and said unto him
[4:27] blessed is the womb that bears thee and
[4:29] the past which thou hast sucked
[4:37] but he said yea rather blessed are they
[4:40] that hear the word of god and keep it
[4:42] apocalypse
[4:45] revelations chapter one verse one two
[4:48] three
[5:01] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[5:03] gave unto him
[5:04] to shew unto his servants things which
[5:06] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[5:08] forth and signified it by his angel unto
[5:12] his servant john
[5:20] who bear record of the word of god and
[5:22] of the testimony of jesus christ and of
[5:25] all things that he saw
[5:36] foreign is he that readers and they that
[5:39] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[5:42] those things which are written therein
[5:44] for the time is at hand gracias thank
[5:47] you
[6:02] i have taken this scripture
[6:10] without knowing what brother johnny was
[6:11] going to be teaching this morning
[6:21] and it concerns the fact that right now
[6:23] is being fought the most greatest battle
[6:25] that has ever been fought
[6:32] in this battle this fight this war it's
[6:35] a spiritual battle
[6:43] now i know that the bible says that the
[6:46] flesh
[6:47] less is against the spirit
[6:53] they're in enmity the flesh and the
[6:56] spirit
[7:01] but as we delve into the word a little
[7:03] more encounter
[7:07] we find out that there are two powers
[7:09] that exist
[7:13] and the apostle paul he uh
[7:15] clarifies it when he tells us
[7:18] he says thanks be to the father
[7:23] his son jesus christ
[7:27] and the work of jesus christ
[7:32] is to deliver us out of the evil clause
[7:34] of satan
[7:37] and it says here textually
[7:42] that he has delivered
[7:55] therefore he's speaking here
[8:08] when everything is reduced down
[8:18] [Music]
[8:24] and the only thing that can make
[8:25] darkness flee
[8:32] that's why in the beginning in the book
[8:34] of genesis
[8:52] because when the light comes
[8:55] loose being that god himself
[9:01] being that his word is a lamp onto our
[9:03] feet
[9:05] when the light comes
[9:20] is the word of
[10:02] we find out that
[10:21] [Music]
[10:40] it was his own disciple that betrayed
[10:43] him
[10:57] without a defense
[11:19] [Music]
[11:46] [Music]
[12:37] [Music]

[36:11] and the lord said unto him go through
[36:12] the midst of the city through the midst
[36:14] of jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[36:16] foreheads of the men that sigh in that
[36:18] cry for all the abominations that be
[36:20] done in the midst thereof
[36:34] and to the others he said in mind
[36:36] hearing go you after him through the
[36:38] city and smite let not your eyes spare
[36:40] neither have you pity anton says

[37:06] but he destroys
[37:31] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[37:33] whereby you are sealed unto the day of

[37:41] let us pray celestial heavenly father
[37:45] give you thanks my god
[37:48] that you are here

[37:53] three
[37:54] numbers
[37:59] there's not a doubt in our house
[38:02] you are
[38:27] is
[38:57] that's what i want to speak about this
[38:59] morning
[39:02] we want to take a look we've been
[39:04] speaking sunday mornings
[39:08] of the exiles from babylon
[39:11] departure from babylon and the return to
[39:14] jerusalem
[39:15] and what was happening there
[39:18] because that's a type
[39:21] of
[39:23] not only of the time of the lord jesus
[39:25] christ
[39:54] 1965 april 10th
[40:03] the word of god was spoken many many
[40:04] hundreds of years before his coming
[40:07] fiction of his crucifixion
[40:22] is
[40:50] we'll be going through these services
[40:51] perhaps next week as we listen to it
[40:55] and of all churches
[40:58] but of all days and all the things that
[41:00] jesus did
[41:02] and certainly
[41:03] todd
[41:32] for ourselves
[41:46] repeat easter
[42:28] morning
[44:06] oh
[44:35] crucificado be crucified
[44:37] he let himself
[44:39] be else
[44:41] foreign
[46:00] there was a unique symbol or a unique
[46:03] signature from the king
[46:07] let everyone else know
[46:10] wherever this seal is
[46:29] it was only unique to the king
[46:32] documents officials many times they
[46:35] signed official documents
[46:39] they sealed it with this sickness
[46:53] where it could be flexible to
[47:08] or prove that it was from the king
[47:13] the king
[47:16] he never took it off
[47:22] to make sure that people knew this was
[47:24] from the king's behalf
[47:28] and the document was genuine
[47:36] could depend on that seal
[47:41] we know different
[47:43] different places in the bible
[47:46] were these signets were used
[47:49] one of them
[48:17] but that gave her authority
[49:10] [Music]
[51:30] go through the midst of the city through
[51:32] the midst of jerusalem and set a mark
[51:33] upon the foreheads of men that cyan cry
[51:36] for all the abominations that be done in
[51:38] the midst thereof
[51:40] now remember
[51:42] remember
[51:44] that ezekiel esta
[51:46] professando's prophesying diablando
[52:30] and this is where i want
[52:59] now in the first year of cyrus king of
[53:01] persia
[53:03] i enjoy what it says
[53:09] that the word of the lord by the mouth
[53:11] of jeremiah might be foreign
[53:26] for the
[55:04] the word
[55:30] [Applause]
[55:58] for a son of god
[56:21] count on it
[56:26] [Music]
[57:07] now these are the children of the
[57:09] province that went up out of the cap out
[57:11] of captivity of those which had been
[57:13] carried away from whom nebuchadnezzar
[57:15] the king of babylon had carried away
[57:17] into babylon and came again unto
[57:19] jerusalem and judah everyone unto his
[57:21] city

[1:01:48] with zerubbabel
[1:01:50] god

[1:01:58] i believe
[1:02:01] if we're gonna depart from babylon
