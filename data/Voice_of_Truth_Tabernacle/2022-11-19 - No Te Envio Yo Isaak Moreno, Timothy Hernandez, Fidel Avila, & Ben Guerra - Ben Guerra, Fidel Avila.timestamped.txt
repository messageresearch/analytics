[24:09] um if you may open your Bibles to Judges
[24:14] chapter six while you guys are opening
[24:18] your Bibles

[24:24] is
[24:28] and we'll be speaking about Gideon
[24:31] tonight
[24:37] amen imagine
[24:41] amen we'll be reading verses 11 through
[24:43] 16.
[24:47] and there came an angel of the Lord and
[24:50] sat under an oak which was in Oprah that
[24:53] pertained unto joash the aberration and
[24:57] his son Gideon thresh wheat by the wine
[24:59] press to hide it from the middle Knights
[25:02] is
[25:16] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[25:18] him and said unto him the Lord is with
[25:20] thee thou Mighty Man of value
[25:27] and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if
[25:30] the Lord be with us why then is all this
[25:33] befall in us and where be all his
[25:35] miracles which our fathers told us of
[25:37] saying did not the Lord bring us up from
[25:39] Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us
[25:42] and delivered us into the hands of the
[25:44] midianites
[25:56] and the Lord looked upon him and said go
[25:58] in this thy might and thou shalt save
[26:01] Israel from the hand of the midianites
[26:02] have not I sent thee
[26:05] is
[26:17] and he said unto him oh my Lord we wish
[26:20] shall I say visual behold my family is
[26:22] poor in Manasseh and I am the least in
[26:24] my fam and my father's house
[26:35] and the Lord said unto him surely I will
[26:38] be with thee and thou shalt Smite the
[26:40] mere Knights as one man
[26:42] is
[26:49] amen let's bow our heads in prayer
[26:52] Lord we give you thanks gracias tonight
[26:55] for letting us gather here at your house
[27:00] that
[27:04] may speak the words that you want me to
[27:06] speak Lord
[27:08] as well as the brothers would be going
[27:11] after me
[27:13] that may be a blessing to at least one
[27:15] Soul yes
[27:17] we thank you for everything we asked us
[27:20] on your name
[27:23] amen amen amen you may be seated
[27:28] amen as we see in this In this passage
[27:31] of the Bible
[27:32] [Music]
[27:35] you see God has a message
[27:38] but God always has a man as well
[27:42] you see we meet the man God chose to
[27:45] save Israel
[27:49] we meet a man named Gideon
[27:53] and his name means he who cuts down
[27:59] well you know in this time it didn't
[28:02] look like you didn't have much to offer
[28:04] a moment
[28:07] at the time that he was called
[28:12] he would be responsible for cutting down
[28:14] the enemies of God's people amen
[28:17] responsibility
[28:20] you see just a little background real
[28:23] quick
[28:24] you know it was a time of poverty
[28:28] you know we know that Israel did not
[28:30] have a lot during these times uh
[28:33] the Israel Israel didn't have Allah
[28:36] these signs were dark and desperate days
[28:39] for them
[28:40] [Music]
[28:42] and his family were hiding in a wine
[28:45] press
[28:48] they're threshing weed behind a wine
[28:50] press my bad it is
[28:55] and they were hiding from the middle of
[28:57] the night is
[29:00] time of persecution
[29:05] the middle Knights were persecuting all
[29:07] all the people from Israel
[29:11] it was a time of powerlessness
[29:15] you see we see this and the fact that
[29:18] Gideon was hiding
[29:23] from his enemy
[29:25] he's just as defeated and just as
[29:27] frightening as the rest of the Nations
[29:33] it was a difficult time for his people
[29:35] foreign
[29:48] has many people fearing that they will
[29:51] be first forced into poverty as well
[29:59] you know we're living in days when it
[30:01] seems that there is little spiritual
[30:03] power among God's people so
[30:10] in some ways we're living through times
[30:13] that strongly resemble these that Gideon
[30:15] was in as as in Israel's time
[30:18] we are living in times
[30:21] in some ways we're living through times
[30:23] that strongly resemble those that Gideon
[30:26] and Israel
[30:29] you know we see Gideon was hiding
[30:32] um
[30:35] and a lot of times you know we're hiding
[30:38] from the enemies
[30:40] but you know the Lord knew exactly where
[30:43] Gideon was
[30:46] do not know where Gideon was
[30:51] he had his eye on Gideon the whole time
[30:56] even when Gideon was unaware of it
[30:59] God was with them
[31:03] and God was playing his future amen
[31:07] should come for us as well
[31:10] we had the same promise
[31:13] because it says in Hebrews 13 5.
[31:17] keep your life eyes free from the love
[31:20] of money and be content with what you
[31:22] have because God has said never Where I
[31:25] Leave You never will I forsake you
[31:27] know
[31:33] amen the Lord is always with us amen
[31:37] they might not feel them at the time
[31:40] but you know when we're in our lowest
[31:42] time we're in the valley we're in the
[31:46] mountains
[31:48] we're wearing our struggles when we're
[31:50] in sickness
[31:51] he's always there with us
[31:54] and you know when the Lord says
[31:58] the Lord Irwin yeah when the Lord says
[32:01] the Lord is with me
[32:04] it literally means his power is on you
[32:10] see Gideon cannot see it
[32:16] and it sure didn't look like it
[32:20] you see we see that because he was
[32:22] scared
[32:24] he didn't know what kind of power he
[32:27] really had because
[32:29] but he was about to use the Lord's power
[32:32] in a mighty way
[32:37] um
[32:39] and the same and it goes the same in our
[32:42] lives as well
[32:43] if whoever grabs the truth that we are
[32:46] by the spirit of God
[32:51] and that has limited power is available
[32:53] to us
[32:59] and it will change our lives amen
[33:02] amen I I find something really amazing
[33:08] you know the Lord looks at Gideon
[33:12] you know scared uh
[33:17] by yourself doubting himself
[33:19] low self-esteem amen
[33:23] he was a poor man amen
[33:26] you know and he looks at Gideon and
[33:28] calls him a mighty man of value amen
[33:35] you know it's
[33:37] it's amazing how God could cause someone
[33:40] so low foreign
[34:24] you know
[34:25] and I just want to read a
[34:30] quote from Brother Branham
[34:33] from the
[34:35] from the
[34:37] message have now I sent the the knows
[34:42] um code 96
[34:43] paragraph 96
[34:46] and when he spoke to Gideon Gideon was a
[34:49] little surprised
[34:53] he said now Mighty Man of Valor
[34:56] he says
[34:59] he didn't know who he was
[35:01] maybe you don't know who you are
[35:05] you might be many of those Mighty Men of
[35:08] value tonight
[35:14] the little church my group is oh my
[35:19] there was only two there
[35:21] him and his daddy
[35:24] there only has to be two here
[35:28] you and Christ
[35:30] that's all it takes to be a mighty man
[35:33] of value
[35:35] that's right yes correct see God
[35:39] specializes and uses those uh especially
[35:44] who can't cannot Britain to accomplish
[35:47] his work in the world
[35:50] you see uh there's um another book in
[35:54] the Bible First Corinthians
[35:58] 26 29.
[36:01] it says brothers and sisters think of
[36:03] what you were when you were called not
[36:06] many of you were Wise by human standards
[36:08] not many were influential not many were
[36:11] of noble birth
[36:21] but but God chose the foolish things of
[36:24] the world to shame the wise God chose
[36:26] the weak things of the world to shame
[36:28] the strong amen
[36:38] God chose the lowly things of this world
[36:40] and the despised things and the things
[36:43] that are not to notify the things that
[36:45] are
[36:52] so that no one may boast before him
[36:56] hey man see God's Gonna use the weak
[37:00] so one day shame the strong amen
[37:04] God's going to use the foolish
[37:06] the wise amen you know Gideon I mean he
[37:11] thought he was nothing
[37:14] he thought he was fight foolish
[37:17] you know I believe his family thought he
[37:20] was you know no one
[37:23] you see we could see um when Jesse
[37:26] looked at
[37:27] Davido
[37:29] he saw his youngest son
[37:32] mere boy who was not worthy to be called
[37:36] to a family meeting with Samuel um
[37:44] and he saw a king amen and when Gideon
[37:48] family looked at him
[37:53] but when the Lord looked at us
[37:56] God seen a warrior amen
[37:59] and you see when the Lord looks at you
[38:02] he doesn't see a weakling we don't want
[38:06] to see someone that's fearful attack the
[38:09] enemy
[38:10] overcome to step up and Rise And tell
[38:14] the enemies
[38:17] you see a lot of the times we're making
[38:19] excuses this is
[38:22] Gideon did exactly what Moses did and
[38:25] then
[38:25] when the Lord Called Moses from the
[38:28] burning bush
[38:32] he made excuses amen
[38:34] both of these men felt like that job was
[38:37] too over their heads
[38:40] that was a job too high for them
[38:43] the real problem with Gideon and Moses
[38:47] and with us as well is that we tend to
[38:51] focus on what we are
[38:54] but we don't focus on who he is
[38:57] amen because he's greater than anything
[39:01] because to be honest without the Lord we
[39:05] are weakness we're frail failures we
[39:09] always spell without him
[39:11] we are Mighty through God
[39:15] to pulling down of strongholds
[39:19] amen I'm about closed captioning not
[39:21] available
[40:06] are you doing what the Lord wants you to
[40:08] do
[40:10] have you found that place of service
[40:13] that he saved you to feel
[40:18] are you content to stand back While
[40:20] others do all the work
[40:24] are you fearful has he been calling you
[40:28] to do something
[40:29] but you hold back making your excuses as
[40:33] to why you can't do that is
[40:38] today the day when you will when you
[40:41] would throw up the white flag
[40:45] of surrender and trust the Lord
[40:48] to do his perfect will in your life
[40:52] are we safe today
[40:55] would be a good day to come to Jesus if
[40:57] you are not always
[41:01] if he's drawing you on any level tonight
[41:06] be obedient to his voice
[41:09] come and let the Lord have his way in
[41:12] your life amen
[41:17] God bless you Brothers
[41:20] [Applause]
[41:29] God bless you can hear me
[41:31] why don't we give a strong amount of
[41:32] Applause to the Lord because he deserves
[41:33] it amen
[41:34] doesn't he deserve all honor and Glory
[41:38] he does amen
[41:40] amen I want to thank brother Isaac for
[41:43] the for the preaching
[41:46] you know every day that God keeps us
[41:48] with life
[41:51] there's another day we won
[41:55] another opportunity
[41:57] another day to make a decision
[42:00] that can either make your life
[42:02] or break your life so is today going to
[42:06] be the day that you make the decisions
[42:09] to follow Christ
[42:11] amen amen
[42:14] good enough
[42:15] I want to read uh two three verses in
[42:18] the in the book of uh
[42:20] Judges
[42:23] chapter six verse 12.
[42:26] essays like this and the angel of the
[42:28] Lord appeared unto him and said unto him
[42:30] the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[42:33] Valerie
[42:39] and getting said unto him
[42:41] now pay attention oh my Lord if the Lord
[42:44] be with us why isn't all this befallen
[42:47] us and where is all the Miracles which
[42:50] our fathers told us of saying did not
[42:53] the Lord bring us us from Egypt but now
[42:56] the Lord had forsaken us and delivered
[42:58] us into the hands of the medianites
[43:20] and I hear the Lord is it talks to to
[43:23] Gideon and says and the Lord looked upon
[43:25] him and said go in this thy might and
[43:27] thou shalt save Israel on the hand of
[43:29] the midianites have not I sent thee yes
[43:42] and verse 23 and the Lord said unto him
[43:45] peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt
[43:48] not die
[43:53] now as I read the book of uh judges
[43:58] I say four things
[44:01] that God sometimes does big things and
[44:03] unlikely ways
[44:09] number two it's not your battle many
[44:14] times in the Book of Judges
[44:16] the goddess
[44:19] I the Lord and with you
[44:22] I the Lord will take you
[44:27] number three God will accomplish his
[44:29] plan
[44:31] God will always accomplish his plans
[44:37] and God wants leaders to walk in
[44:39] confidence by faith
[44:44] now when the Lord spoke to him and says
[44:47] Thou Mighty Man of Valerie
[44:52] you know and then in the New
[44:54] International Version
[44:57] it says a mighty warrior
[45:00] Guerrero now brother Brown states
[45:04] that Gideon was probably in his mid 50s
[45:09] he was bald headed and with sheepskin
[45:11] over him as a clothing
[45:16] he says there was nothing to him
[45:19] another thing about him nothing
[45:21] extraordinary you know God takes people
[45:25] there is nothing too
[45:28] that's what God wants
[45:31] people who are surrendered people that
[45:34] have no rights
[45:37] you know God God calls us worthy and his
[45:39] children
[45:42] and Gideon you know in verse 15.
[45:49] he he makes an excuse
[45:51] he says behold my family is poor me uh
[45:57] and I am the least in my father's house
[46:02] let me tell you something
[46:06] for God there's no excuses
[46:10] for God there's no excuse God will
[46:13] fulfill his plan don't matter
[46:20] you know most of us do not look at
[46:22] ourselves as worthy
[46:24] most of us instead see ourselves
[46:27] poisonous before our worthy God
[46:29] most of us hear ourselves unworthy
[46:31] before our worthy guys uh
[46:37] and that there's nothing in us that
[46:39] would qualify us as worthy
[46:42] but then God looks at us and says but I
[46:46] see you worthy
[46:48] and that is what what God was telling to
[46:51] Gideon
[46:52] I see you worthy
[46:55] to accomplish the plan
[46:57] that I have for the people of Israel
[47:01] you know but we asked how is that
[47:03] possible how can our holy righteous
[47:04] Almighty all-knowing
[47:08] you know look at us and think us worthy
[47:14] because our worthiness does not generate
[47:16] from us
[47:20] it generates from him who lives in us
[47:24] because he because he who is where he
[47:27] lives inside of us
[47:31] God makes us worthy
[47:33] God made Gideon Worthy
[47:39] amen amen
[47:42] you know Gideon was was fearful and he
[47:44] was scared
[47:49] but God will always accomplish his plan
[47:53] you know you are here tonight
[48:01] because he saw something
[48:04] God saw something in each and every one
[48:06] of us here tonight
[48:11] Gideon's thoughts
[48:13] that disqualified himself
[48:17] now listen closely
[48:20] that disqualified himself
[48:24] in his own eyes
[48:26] did not disqualify him in the in the
[48:29] eyes of God
[48:33] there's nothing
[48:35] that disqualifies you yeah
[48:39] for being Worthy
[48:43] you know sometimes we put ourselves
[48:44] thoughts
[48:47] we think ourselves
[48:49] of ourselves that we can't do certain
[48:53] things
[48:54] oh God can't use me you know or I can't
[48:57] strongly
[48:59] I can't help in the sun is cool
[49:01] I can't sing a special or I can't help
[49:04] out any part of church
[49:07] you know that's what you think but what
[49:09] does God think about
[49:11] what did God think of Gideon
[49:14] he saw wave past his fault
[49:18] he saw way past his ears
[49:24] as brother Isaac said
[49:26] it takes you in Christ
[49:29] here tonight
[49:31] to be a mighty man
[49:35] woman
[49:39] you know God wants people who aren't
[49:41] perfect
[49:44] you know people who are willing to leave
[49:46] everything
[49:49] look Abraham was old
[49:52] Elijah was to his title
[49:56] Joseph was abused
[49:58] Joe went bankrupt
[50:01] Moses had a speech problems
[50:04] getting was afraid
[50:06] Samson was a womanizer
[50:09] Rahab was a prostitute
[50:12] American woman a divorce Noah was a
[50:14] drunk
[50:17] Jeremiah Was Young Jacob was a cheater
[50:20] David
[50:30] Peter denied Christ three times
[50:34] Martha worried about everything
[50:39] the disciples fell asleep while praying
[50:43] a Pharisee who persecuted Christians
[50:49] before becoming one
[50:53] let me tell you Brothers
[50:56] there's there's absolutely nothing
[50:59] that can hold you back
[51:02] from the will of God in your life
[51:06] amen amen
[51:09] foreign
[51:51] that's all it takes to be a man of
[51:53] Baylor amen

[52:03] I I see himself I see him
[52:07] when he when the
[52:09] Angel appeared unto him until
[52:13] and he tells him a mighty thou Mighty
[52:17] Man of Baylor
[52:18] all of these thoughts are coming to his
[52:21] mind
[52:23] they say he he's not qualified to do
[52:26] that
[52:28] you know how many of us think of us that
[52:30] way sometimes
[52:32] that we think that we can't
[52:35] do something that God has asked us to do
[52:41] I like to close with this
[52:44] with this message and the message of God
[52:47] be with us then where's all his miracles
[52:51] and he called him the man of Valerie
[52:56] Valiente and he said that God was going
[52:58] to do this thing
[53:00] and he said God is with you
[53:03] he said then where is all his miracles
[53:07] if the supernatural God is here where is
[53:10] the supernatural works of God
[53:14] that could be easily said tonight
[53:16] amongst our churches

[53:22] die is he gone is he pursuing is he off
[53:24] on a trip

[55:08] Edition
[55:09] starts out
[55:12] that Gideon was around 50 years of age
[55:17] I'm a little horse Brothers
[55:22] don't try and run from me
[55:26] I was taking a pill yeah
[55:31] and I wanted it almost to run because it
[55:34] was burning my insides
[55:41] I feel a little better so I could speak
[55:45] the problem is is here Brothers
[55:49] who was the problem
[55:52] gideonitas or the medianites what was
[55:55] the problem that is the question what
[55:59] was the problem
[56:01] in our in our picture that we see it
[56:04] wasn't the media
[56:06] in our lives it's not the devil
[56:12] sometimes we blame the Devils
[56:15] the devil has nothing to do with it
[56:19] what was the problem
[56:22] what problem did Gideon
[56:26] there was a self-esteem problem
[56:30] he found himself in a place
[56:34] they call it is
[56:53] a mighty man of Valor that's how he told
[56:57] him what's that you know
[57:04] a coward
[57:06] cowardly
[57:08] that was hiding
[57:10] now the problem was
[57:13] he doesn't say it here
[57:16] this is here in verse 13 it says
[57:20] if the Lord is with us
[57:23] why has all this happened to us
[57:27] the first thing that we do it's to blame
[57:30] the devil
[57:33] there's no problem you're going through
[57:35] tonight
[57:38] but I don't know if you've gotten to the
[57:40] point in your life that you get tired
[57:45] you get tired of the devil stepping all
[57:48] over you I get tired
[57:51] I get tired of the devil always
[57:57] of myself
[58:00] in what way
[58:02] in your mind
[58:05] sometimes you don't want
[58:08] you don't want to do bad things
[58:11] there's something inside of you
[58:13] inside of your heart
[58:16] says that there's a soul
[58:21] do something for God
[58:24] in your mind
[58:27] there becomes a battle in here
[58:35] to beat us there yeah and the problem is
[58:39] that we let it go down into our hearts
[58:46] the problem lies there
[58:50] is
[58:51] and he says Where are all of his uh
[58:55] which our fathers have told us saying
[58:59] look he says
[59:06] forsaken us and he has delivered us into
[59:08] the hands of the midianites look
[59:11] God never left them okay okay
[59:18] Brothers I don't know if that
[59:58] no matter what the cost is
[1:00:01] the most tremendous part is
[1:00:04] that there was God Brothers
[1:00:08] yeah that's right amen
[1:00:13] it doesn't matter how far you've Fallen
[1:00:18] it doesn't matter how far you've Fallen
[1:00:22] I have the news for you tonight
[1:00:25] God loves you
[1:00:29] doesn't matter how you are
[1:00:32] saying if there's something in your
[1:00:35] heart
[1:00:37] is
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:00:49] but
[1:00:53] if it's still there
[1:00:55] and today is your day
[1:00:59] I
[1:01:01] want to be with you
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] but
[1:01:08] here's Gideon
[1:01:10] blaming God
[1:01:13] when he was at fault
[1:01:17] this is
[1:01:20] then he said ah my Lord
[1:01:23] Israel what shall I save Israel yeah
[1:01:28] behold my family is poor in Madison
[1:01:33] the word Manassas means to forget
[1:01:37] he's been forgotten
[1:01:43] now my question is who told who told
[1:01:46] Manasseh
[1:01:50] but all of these things
[1:01:53] that he was telling the angels that he
[1:01:57] was poor
[1:02:00] sometimes we do the same thing
[1:02:05] sometimes we put our own self-esteem to
[1:02:07] to the ground
[1:02:10] sometimes we can't see with these eyes
[1:02:13] how precious
[1:02:18] lady before the eyes of God
[1:02:45] and it's a sprout from within you
[1:02:53] I'm going to be closing with this
[1:02:55] Brothers
[1:02:59] foreign
[1:03:57] look captain
[1:04:00] Cristiano are you a Christian

[1:04:07] myself
[1:04:13] talking to you about it
[1:04:21] whether or not you had an experience
[1:04:24] that you're sure
[1:04:28] today if God calls you home
[1:04:32] it doesn't matter sometimes we think
[1:04:34] just because
[1:04:53] it's sad to see a young a young man of
[1:04:56] 14 years of age in a casket
[1:04:59] Cristiano and he says are you a
[1:05:01] Christian
[1:05:02] and he says I was a Christian El dijo

[1:05:27] now think about everything
[1:05:32] look you better think fast because you
[1:05:34] don't have much better but think about
[1:05:37] it
[1:05:40] all the way to the where you left Christ
[1:05:44] I don't know if there's here a person
[1:05:49] I'm not talking about religion
[1:05:53] I'm talking about if you've left Christ
[1:05:56] at some place
[1:06:01] you started very motivated
[1:06:05] but there came a point where you grew
[1:06:07] cold

[1:07:17] that he was waiting there for you
[1:07:19] brother John
[1:07:21] and how many of us have left him

[1:08:27] you will not lie you ignored it and
[1:08:29] moved on one thing or another
[1:08:32] that you shouldn't have done is

[1:08:42] now you have to go back and start from
[1:08:45] there again

[1:25:43] because we come and we say how many are
[1:25:47] down
[1:25:51] and realistically
[1:25:54] if you were borderline
[1:25:59] if you're like right in the middle
[1:26:02] sister
[1:26:04] of feeling good or bad
[1:26:07] now I just pushed you a little further
[1:26:09] down
[1:26:11] so we don't want to do that tonight
[1:26:14] but the scripture says
[1:26:20] yeah how many know the death of God
[1:26:24] how he had that experience
[1:26:27] in one day you got to know him
[1:26:40] that there was no more sin
[1:26:45] there was no more the whole guy okay
[1:26:51] and took you to a place
[1:26:54] that you wanted to know more of him
[1:27:09] we gotta wanna know him
[1:27:14] want him
[1:27:17] more than this breath that we breathe
[1:27:20] hello
[1:27:28] you great man of Valor Tu hombre Grande
[1:27:34] this is the realistic thing
[1:27:38] he said oh you're talking to me he says
[1:27:42] he looked behind him
[1:27:46] is he talking to me
[1:27:50] that's the way it was
[1:27:52] that's the way it is most of the time
[1:27:55] we forget how great God is
[1:28:00] the prophet that God tells us
[1:28:04] the Greater Works
[1:28:07] great works that I do la soras
[1:28:15] amen what great works mayores
[1:28:20] what grade Works que Hombres Grande
[1:28:23] many times we want to look if we want to
[1:28:25] see Miracles
[1:28:29] we want to see the sick Hills
[1:28:33] we want to jump up and down
[1:28:37] but that's not the Greater Works
[1:28:41] that's not the Greater Works
[1:28:44] those those might be His blessings
[1:28:48] that might be the cherry on top
[1:28:51] that might be the whipped cream
[1:28:54] that's not the greater word
[1:28:57] because Gideon says
[1:29:03] then where are his miracles
[1:29:06] but the prophet of God
[1:29:09] he gives the interpretations
[1:29:24] where are those miracles
[1:29:42] there's only 10 people saved in the room
[1:29:47] come on church is this all that says
[1:29:55] where are his miracles
[1:29:57] are you lost are you lost
[1:30:05] take your seat
[1:30:08] searches it's got to be a personal walk
[1:30:11] between you and God
[1:30:15] individuals and I and tonight
