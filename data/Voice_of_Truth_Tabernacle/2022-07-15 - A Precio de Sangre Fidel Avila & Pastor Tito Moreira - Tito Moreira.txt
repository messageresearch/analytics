they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamfor and house [Music] to help us this you may be seated brethren me and our myself and our pastor titled this message appreciate take that and we're going to stop a little on the 10th plague if there's a youth that can tell me what the tenth plague was who can say what the tenth plague was thank you brother it was death the last plague was death and we're going to speak a little on what happened on the passover because i wanted to jump ahead where the people of israel are crossing the red sea but we cannot oversee the passover esta importante it's something important they had to be very good-looking and now they had to bring it to their house they had to bring it to their own house and they had to make sure for four days was perfect what happened with our lord jesus christ it's just foreign when your children start saying to you what means by this service now what is the passover exodus 12 26 says that you shall say it is the sacrifice of the lord's passover who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt to the lord jesus christ allow me brother and you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lintel and the two-sided post with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of this door out of the door of the house until the morning have to bring it carlo and sacrifice it they had to eat it had to be cooked they didn't have to be in water is word of god uh place the blood or that's in the basin on and strike the lint and the one who was in charge special had to be and it was the father the father i believe is is in our and my wife says put the cloth over the our child you have to make sure no don't leave tonight do something in your life your heart will tell you that you're right with god how do you want something from [Music] applied the blood i need to make sure the father was the priest of the house los ninos padres the kids watch over the dad in the modern world but the father was to watch over his house he killed the land how much you had done to be saved the scripture says that he saw the blood captain understand this when the devil comes and accuses [Music] he does not see [Music] what would happen if that is that it was difficult this night are you prepared prepared because the day is coming the day is coming that there won't be no more preachers our pastor won't be here preachers of today won't [Music] you are under his blood make that when you that there was no sin nothing good awaits us i'm going to step down el diablo the devil wants to make us fall in love he wants to make us fall in love the devil wants to make you fall in love he's not playing it's heavy has provided we are privileged without making sure you're under that precious blood you always bend god bless you brother [Applause] point to marcelo you may be seated psalms 105. god bless everyone god bless his word we're speaking on moses and we're now in the transition when they're about to leave on that night they're gonna finally leave salmo psalms 105. i'm sorry can i get here verse 23. psalms 105 23. israel also came into egypt and jacob's sergeant in the land of ham multiplicos and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies cambio he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtly with his servants embryo he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen they shoot his signs among them and wanders in the land of him he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not against his word he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kings terminus he spake and there came dive divers sorts of flies and lies in other coasts lesiogra he gave them hell for rain and a flaming fire in their land he smote their vines also and their fig trees and broke their trees of their coasts notice the destruction god brings notice how god is destroying people and they continue living a lavish life no no it hurt them so much you speak and the locusts came and caterpillars and that without numbers all herbs in their land and devour the fruit of their ground also the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strengths in other words he took away their strengths he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes egypt was glad when they departed when they departed for the fear of them fell upon them now we see egypt's story the story of exodus egypt is the type of the world and god allowed his people go because the bible says has i believe that's how the people of israel felt so they didn't see no points eternal it's very different to the freedom the devil offers in the world he mentioned when he's in prison i am so free in prison i'm you because until you realize how much of a slave you are so this nature that we have is dominating dumb nature we have esta naturales this dumb nature we have people live is [Music] on the final tenth plague he says the angel of death will pass [Music] he's gonna hit them where it hurts the most but i want you to understand that's what the devil does that's what sin does i know god allows it but i want you to understand god is life because sometimes we need to if you always handle that they can see it with the picture and got it that at the end everything ends with death [Music] and the devil takes everything you have alfinale at the end like albert fidel said after he makes you fall in love he only wants to destroy you completely and he says this will be the final plague because freedom one by one oh you know i don't believe it oh killed and fill their homes with blood and alcohol it was something horrible bonito it wasn't nothing [Applause] [Music] of the tabernacle you know the tabernacle was a place god provided in the wilderness you said that at the gate or entrance of the tabernacle in other words at the entrance of the church there was an altar there was an altar named the altar of sacrifice and at the entrance this place that was the most important for israel when you enter through the doors in a choir [Applause] his children watch el sacrificio the sacrifice era was substituted the substitute was their firstborn can anyone here say i was the one that had to die we don't deserve anything or to be here amen and god is showing them this is the price of your sins how terrible [Applause] that deserve to die the price was too high and painful brother branham says some 1900 years ago there was an old rugged cross going down through jerusalem dragging out the bloody footprints of the bearer enzo camino hacienda he couldn't go no farther and worship god it's because he paid the price if we can come someone paid the price because he paid the price he did not deserve but he gave himself he gave himself entirely the bible says when god gives him the instructions i'll meet more for himself he saw everything he did every one of them to enjoy true joy and he called me but i want he said i he asked me god wants us to be happy right i said yes god wants us happy but he wants our happiness be based on eternal things not on earthly things in other words your happiness to come from the things that are from eternal things present things not of things of this world god wants our happiness that our joy comes from of [Music] you rejoice [Music] i rejoice [Music] and he will give me everything [Music] [Music] everything that loved you and everything you loved will be with you there [Music] you go pestilence of body [Music] i don't want to spend another second here [Music] it's something filthy [Music] [Music] true [Music] [Music] you have to pay a price when you leave egypt mass greater sacrifice than when you had to sacrifice sacrifice yes i need to sacrifice something as a christian female yes it's not easy it's not easy to die to oneself because it's not easy to sacrifice yes [Music] after a way of living [Music] [Music] sacrifice from your behalf is required [Music] you know we come to church and it seems quite that we're complaining sometimes of being christians but we don't understand that that's how we're being delivered sacrificial our proverbs 26 says six says faith for the wounds of a friend faithful are the wounds of he that loves you there is why doesn't he give me everything i want porque it's to [Applause] so yes [Music] sacrifice is required [Music] the altar is open [Music] thinking that he died for me it's not enough that's fine but if you want true freedom you have to bring your own sacrifices this pestilence lord a sacrifice is required [Music] god bless you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] fear [Music] was [Music] do [Music] oh is [Music] fear [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] god [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] his souls
