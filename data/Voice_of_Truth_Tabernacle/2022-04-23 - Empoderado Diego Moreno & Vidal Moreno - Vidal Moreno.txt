no better place to be in the house of our lives amen let's open our bibles the book of genesis says chapter 37 and we'll go ahead and start at verse 3. amen man i'll go ahead and read it or i'll give you a little bit of time to find it now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors go ahead and jump down to verse 13 now and it says and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock and shekel come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here am i. and now lastly verse 14. and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and with the and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the veil of hebron and he came to chican las vegas celestial and i just asked you that your words be spoken today father i just asked you be with us tonight god and may your will amen amen amen so today are you may be seated and today along with my dad um we're going to be talking about joseph jose and for a title we've chosen empowered amen so the piece of scripture that we've uh we've read today it tells us that joseph uh being the youngest was given a cody man and joseph was last in line he had 11 before him so imagine that you're 17 years old your oldest brother is like 40. hey man so i think it's safe to say that joseph was the weakest out of everyone i don't think that's such a bad thing amen because god chooses those uh that are the weakest to be made strong amen his word says my my strength is made perfect in weakness i mean amen so god isn't looking for someone that doesn't need help god god is looking for someone that can't establish someone who needs his help amen and another thing that we see here is that joseph was given a coat of many colors and what have we been given that coat was filled with the seven colors of the rainbow colors and each of each one of these colors it represents one of the seven churches the entire godhead the entire the entirety of god is at our disposal amen and we know that god is so huge can i then ask you what what about when god walks up to you does god have what do you do with what brother brennan has given us amen chaos personally when i see those messages sitting on the shelf collecting dust it makes me feel bad because especially one last thing here from what we've uh what we've read is that joseph was uh he was given authority he was put as a supervisor amen is that him being the youngest that his father chose him to go and check on his brothers amen and that's i believe that's the way we should be too okay hey man you've been empowered with the caring for your brother nosotros that for for for the age that we're living in the step for the age that we're living in is a brotherly kindness amen so you've been empowered to care for your brothers and many times we ask god for help we ask god to be empowered and god sends god sends one of our brothers when we say god i thought i asked you for help and the help was found in our brother amen i would like to take a look at what the world's definition of of where power comes from is definition when you're empowered what does that mean i mean the definition that i found here is the definition the process of becoming stronger and more confident especially in controlling and controlling one's life and claiming one's rights especially and then the second one here says but empowerment can also have many different meanings to different people different significantes amen so pretty much what we can draw from these definitions the world gives you the idea that too that to do as you please is to have power and that to believe as you want us to have power immensely hey man it's come to the point where people say if i want to be a guy one day i can be a guy or if i want to be a girl i can be a girl a man amen did you know that the the flag for the for the gays and lesbians it's it's made up of many colors too so do you know how people are barely finding out who they are they've lived their entire lives being the opposite sex amen amen we have to we have to find out who we are too amen this right here is that you have right there this is just square one is this is just a base this is this is step number one god has so much more for you and did you know that the world is waiting for you to find out who you are romans 8 19 says like this romano's it says like this for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god and acts acts 2 17 says like this and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams now i want to talk a little bit about what god what what where does god say power comes from hey man luke 24 49. um 49. but just bear with me i know i'm reading a lot but i'm i'm getting somewhere i promise and it says like this ccic and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but terry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high luke 1 2 29 49 24 29. hey man so this phrase from on high alright now this is telling us where power comes from and according to the to the dictionary amen so pretty much what god is telling us here is that all power comes from god amen how many want powers how many want to live the life to have power hey man sometimes we have to put our own self aside so that god can when god first released the holy spirit to the church the bible says that they were all in one accord and that means that you have to put yourself aside amen sometimes sometimes we say oh it doesn't fit with my beliefs it doesn't coordinate with my agenda i don't have time let me tell you brothers god wants to take you a lot farther than time is bro god wants you don't hesitate to put on the word and say that it feels good amen amen amen amen we see coming back to the story of of joseph and israel we see that uh that israel chose joseph amen the amen and it was it was interesting to see that because him being the youngest it seemed like he'd just be out of the question for that special coat amen to receive the power amen hey man i just want to see i just want to show you just dig into this power that i've been talking about us to to be empowered by things on earth amen but we'll get his power if it's not tested and when you see that the question joseph got his coat they took it off i don't know about you guys but i'd be pretty bummed out if they took michael jordan probably wasn't even a day amen amen but that didn't phase him i know that if i got a call from my dad and my brothers did not feel special amen so then can i ask you uh how attached are you to these worldly things amen to these earthly things to the money to the clothes whatever it is that that you desire they say what if what if it was all taken away what if what if one day just just like job in the blink of an eye everything's just gone from you a hope and unable he died naked some people picture him with the cloth but it is naked yeah he was naked i believe he still manifested what he was told so if you came from jesus jesus it doesn't matter what they take from you amen i'm in hey man brother that's all i have but god bless you this is [Applause] i just uh i want to just hit on what diego spoke of a little bit joseph uh you know being empowered you know the first uh the first the first time we see uh the the rainbow la primera it's in uh it's in genesis chapter six s and hennessey's capitol los angeles uh you know verse three uh versicolors uh i just kind of want to uh go to verse three for a little bit you don't have to stand up but it says like this what are these scenes it says and the lord said you know had seen what man had done you know it knows time it's very similar to the time that we live in milan you know there was a lot of violence you know i imagine there was there was just a strife everywhere but you know through all that god was still striving with man you know he was he was still trying to he was still striving with man you know verse six elves you know of that same chapter you know what it says it it says he said it says you know and it repented the lord that he had made man on earth and it grieved him at his heart you know uh when you read that esto you know you might say well god repented in making man you know the last part says you know that it grieved him at his heart you know it hurt god with you he was in pain el estabando lord you know when you lose somebody you said you know you're grieving us oh you're hurting you said you know but and we know that um the the uh the flood came ross you know god was gonna bring judgment upon the earth amen amen because of all the things that man had done you knowing that maybe he couldn't see past what the rainbow means what it he's he gives this robe to joseph [Music] and this is something that's very special you know if this if this was a perfect church god gave is is giving this status you know i think that the youth in particular you know are very uh are very prone to you know looking at their status especially especially not on social media no you want people to know someone you know because we put available for everybody else because you know it wasn't his fault he was given the road it was not his fault you see the other guys looked at him nosotros they saw him they're like well he thinks he's better than us because he was given this i believe that the way he behaved the way he carried himself to his father that he was worthy of the culture that he was worthy of wearing what i think what was given to him hey man a man i believe that because because beyond the codes go beyond this coach i want to excuse me uh there is more i must oh there is more to you i must than just the the the appearance of godliness amen amen i believe that now i'm not saying to to look terrible but there's more to it there's more to being a christian christian than just putting a tie on it or or just putting on long dresses and having long hair there's more to it today there is so much more he was a type of perfectionist and that's what the church of jesus christ will have to be then now they won't be in themselves they won't be it in themselves i want to read the rainbow's also used for the homosexuals that's their sign you know but there's not seven colors in there there's not seven colors in the rainbow colors there's only six colors there's only six colors in the rainbow solo colors and you know and the the one that's missing hand in [Music] that nobody else [Applause] i want the devil to know i'm not going back you know you see there's one thing that we don't see a lot of times is that whenever whenever we stand still because it's a pyramid there you see and it gets a little slippery sometimes so you got to keep moving my way up sometimes moving hey let me back up i'll hold that one i'll tell you about that hallelujah because we know that joseph jose he was thrown that's the truth so that whatever [Music] and wherever joseph was i want you to see what happened but joseph says this jose he says how can i sin against my god he put god first he didn't even say he didn't say i'm gonna sin against my master but he said i'm going to he said how can i sin against my god and then his master's especially jesus is oh you oh yes but everything that anybody ever needed todos they had to go through joseph but the lord will give you power he'll give you the power to do just that if you can't show up he'll give you the power to do it any drop of the devil diablo you know any anything that come our way we were made overcomers we were made overcomers you amen amen i invite the youth or anybody in general if you need si necesita if you need si necesita you need salvation salvation
