[27:02] [Music]
[27:28] open your bibles to the book of joshua
[27:30] chapter 2 verse 1.
[27:42] for allowing us to borrow his pulpit
[27:44] my name is
[27:49] other brothers that are watching us
[27:50] through the internet california
[27:52] from california
[27:54] mexico
[27:57] and other places
[28:17] and joshua the son of none sent out of
[28:20] shittim two men to spy secretly saying
[28:22] go view the land even jericho and they
[28:24] went and came into and harlot's house
[28:26] named rahab and lodged there
[28:37] and it was told the king of jericho
[28:39] saying behold there come men in hitherto
[28:41] night of the children of israel to
[28:43] search out the country
[28:54] and the king of jericho sent unto rahab
[28:56] saying bring forth the men that are come
[28:58] to thee which are entered into in-house
[29:00] for they became to search out all the
[29:02] country
[29:11] and the woman took the man and hid them
[29:12] and said thus there came men unto me but
[29:14] i wish not once they were
[29:21] done
[29:25] and it came to pass about the time of
[29:27] shutting of the gate when it was dark
[29:28] that the men went out whether the men
[29:30] when i what not pursue after them
[29:33] quickly for ye shall overtake them
[29:43] but she had brought them up to the roof
[29:44] of the house and hid them with the
[29:45] stalks of flax which she had laid in
[29:48] order upon the roof
[29:51] our heads please celestial
[30:20] name
[30:22] of your son jesus christ amen amen
[30:25] you may be seated
[30:30] israel
[30:33] establishes a
[30:36] israel the bible says was in chatim
[30:38] before crossing the the jordan river
[30:41] jericho almost in front of jericho
[30:45] este pueblo de jerico
[30:51] this town of jericho had heard of all
[30:52] the miracles that god had done for the
[30:54] people of israel
[30:58] jericho began to panic
[31:02] there became a spirit of fear that went
[31:04] over them
[31:05] allowed by god
[31:09] because the bible says that god always
[31:10] goes before us
[31:13] of all those who believe him
[31:16] and they stand for him
[31:22] they had seen the miracles that god had
[31:24] done
[31:27] they had defeated the two kings of the
[31:28] amorites
[31:30] how he
[31:59] but i want to focus on a youth a young
[32:02] lady
[32:03] named rahab
[32:06] a prostitute he was a prostitute
[32:10] a harlot
[32:23] a person who has a sexual relations for
[32:26] money or for another benefit
[32:30] she was a young a young person
[32:35] she had also heard of the miracles god
[32:38] had done
[32:52] right
[32:57] [Music]
[33:20] i can see you farther on a little
[33:43] after she had got her first hearing of
[33:45] israel and of a god who was a god that
[33:46] answered prayer
[33:49] not only a god to pray to but
[33:51] respond but a god that answered back
[33:56] when she heard that there was a god of
[33:57] miracles
[33:59] who could perform miracles
[34:19] algo
[34:20] something was coming yeah
[34:22] and she knew it
[34:26] she knew that it was a god
[34:28] so powerful
[34:31] that he could take that city
[34:45] many of us that come from the streets
[34:46] that come from outside yo yo experience
[34:49] i had those experiences
[34:54] god began to do things in my life
[34:57] before i even came to church
[34:59] i didn't even go to church
[35:42] one day two representatives came to
[35:43] jericho
[35:46] and quickly her on the street as a
[35:48] prostitute
[35:50] she called them took them into her house
[35:56] they're after
[36:08] the word of god says that they only went
[36:09] to iran
[36:22] even though their way of dressing was
[36:24] different
[36:38] and i also believe that they they walked
[36:40] differently
[36:44] and she received them
[36:50] and she waited uh from some uh for
[36:52] something from god
[36:56] because god doesn't stay with nothing
[37:00] you know in matthew 10 41
[37:10] in the name of a prophet shall receive a
[37:11] prophet's reward
[37:17] and he that receiveth a righteous man in
[37:19] the name of righteous man shall receive
[37:20] a righteous man's reward
[37:24] so she's seeing something different in
[37:26] these two men
[37:28] god always works the same
[37:31] in the temple
[37:34] in the time of moses
[37:38] he sent moses
[37:40] to preach before he destroyed
[37:43] in the temple
[37:44] in the time of noah el mangano
[37:46] he sent noah
[37:48] before
[38:02] and this
[38:08] if he was going to if he was going to
[38:10] destroy then why would he send two two
[38:12] spies to preachers
[38:15] because god knew that there was seed
[38:16] there a via alien question
[38:19] there was someone that was crying
[38:24] in that hall in the heart in the heart
[38:25] of a harlot
[38:29] those two ministers
[38:44] when moses and joshua were on the road
[38:46] to the wilderness coming to the exodus
[38:51] they sent out some ministers spies
[38:54] to go spiral to land
[38:59] and remember there was a gentile over on
[39:01] the other side of the river by the name
[39:02] of rehab
[39:04] she was a harlot
[39:07] poor kid was a street walker
[39:10] perhaps turned out by her family
[39:26] and she wanted to know if there could be
[39:28] any mercy could be granted to her
[39:32] so when they went into her home
[39:36] they began to preach
[39:39] she didn't ask
[39:53] how handsome he was
[39:59] i forgot a point when she seen these two
[40:00] men in la calle in the street
[40:04] although she had this office this job
[40:08] she didn't seduce them to have an
[40:10] opportunity
[40:13] god had revealed to her
[40:17] they were men of god
[40:21] there was no need to do anything
[40:43] it says and when she got the first
[40:44] message from the two preachers that went
[40:46] over
[40:50] quickly she accepted it with all her
[40:51] heart hey i know
[40:53] she didn't doubt
[40:57] she didn't put her home or her people
[40:59] before them
[41:01] not even her own family
[41:31] and god will reward us one day
[41:42] and there was a scarlet cord bound at
[41:44] her window
[41:46] for protection of her house
[41:50] because she had received the message
[41:55] it was a guarantee that god was giving
[41:57] her
[41:59] just as he gave it to israel there back
[42:01] in egypt
[42:05] the sign of the blood on their doorposts
[42:11] and this was simply because she had
[42:12] believed
[42:44] it doesn't matter what you're struggling
[42:45] with
[42:48] doesn't matter the spirit you're
[42:49] struggling
[42:52] the bad life that you're leading
[42:55] mercy from god
[43:11] here in the same message the prophet
[43:13] says
[43:18] did you know she typed the gentile
[43:20] church
[43:21] until she was a gentile
[43:24] she was a
[44:33] i've had a new opportunity
[44:37] and i could grab it
[44:44] even though my hands were dirtied
[44:48] i could see paul
[44:51] that he had a new opportunity
[44:57] and you can have a new opportunity today
[45:02] not mattering
[45:43] all of it
[46:01] [Applause]
[46:09] god bless your brothers and sisters
[46:12] um
[46:27] uh rahab believed in a god that she
[46:28] didn't put anything other else before
[46:31] god
[46:34] you know and like he said we're all
[46:36] found in a spiritual prostitution
[46:51] you know message to take
[46:53] for all of us to get closer to god
[46:58] how many come prepared tonight
[47:01] or how many how many came to sleep
[47:04] you know i think we should all take
[47:06] another step closer to him every single
[47:08] day
[47:37] a prostitution in other words
[47:40] you know and i looked at the definition
[47:42] of a prostitute
[47:46] and of course as we all know is to sell
[47:48] to sell your body for money
[47:52] but one of the definitions that really
[47:53] caught my eye
[47:56] it says to devote to corrupt
[48:01] to the vote
[48:05] to corrupt your unworthy purposes
[48:13] to devote to corrupt or unworthy
[48:15] purposes
[48:18] improposito
[48:21] yeah and and it really caught my
[48:22] attention because
[48:24] you know there's things that we do every
[48:26] single day
[48:28] you know that are corrupt
[48:31] you know that are unworthy that purposes
[48:33] that are unworthy
[48:35] you know and this harlot this this ray
[48:37] hasta ramirez you know as we as we begin
[48:41] to read in chapter two
[48:44] that she heard
[48:46] now
[48:54] of the miracles of how god took them out
[48:57] of israel
[48:58] of egypt
[49:27] it says now remember she uh she was like
[49:28] where have the harlot
[49:30] this little woman was she never seen a
[49:32] miracle
[49:40] she'd only heard about america
[49:42] ohio
[50:10] you know
[50:18] when the spies come over she didn't have
[50:20] to say
[50:21] i'll tell you you bring josh over here
[50:23] and let him hold a service for me
[50:43] and i'll see whether i can accept him or
[50:44] not
[50:46] she said i have heard that the god of
[50:49] heaven was with you
[51:34] yeah god doesn't see your condition
[51:39] you know he god himself became flesh
[51:43] you know to be able to understand us as
[51:45] humans
[51:48] you know so if if god can understand us
[51:52] he can understand what you go through
[51:55] you know but it's no one's perfect
[51:58] is perfecto no one here is perfect
[52:01] you know but if we can just say lord
[52:04] give me mercy lord
[52:08] i want you to look around
[52:11] and you see all these people here
[52:15] you know we're all walking miracles
[52:31] and josue dos
[52:33] verse 11 capitulo
[52:35] and as soon as we had heard these things
[52:37] our hearts did melt neither neither did
[52:40] there remain any more courage in man
[52:42] because for you for the lord your god is
[52:44] the god of heaven above and in the earth
[52:58] you know as as i've read chapter two
[53:03] you know i i could see a believer
[53:08] you know even though her past
[53:11] past that she was forced into pasado
[53:17] just by hearing
[53:20] and we know that that that faith coming
[53:22] by hearings
[53:24] you know i see a gentile
[53:28] like a method of presbyterian like
[53:31] anything that she could have just been
[53:32] anything else
[53:39] uh romans 10 13 for whosoever shall call
[53:41] upon the name of the lord shall be saved
[53:47] you know and that's what rahab did
[53:49] yesterday
[53:51] no she said lord i'm nothing
[53:54] lord i'm nothing without
[54:29] and the world passes away and the lust
[54:31] thereof he that doeth the will of god
[54:34] abideth forever
[54:45] you know
[54:46] you know she knew that those men that
[54:48] came in
[54:54] you know and the only thing she wanted
[54:55] to know brother ben says
[54:59] if there could be any mercy granted to
[55:01] her
[55:04] yeah
[55:06] says god gives mercy to those who call
[55:08] for mercy
[55:13] all that call for mercy
[55:16] shall receive mercy
[55:29] you know
[55:30] god cares for each and every one of us
[55:32] here tonight
[56:00] there's still hope for you
[56:14] you know there's still mercy i missed
[56:17] you know and i think we should call for
[56:18] that
[56:21] you know because one day
[56:23] that direct line with god that we have
[56:25] salinas
[56:27] will one day go away
[56:31] and the message he cares do you care
[56:36] important
[56:39] he so cared even for a woman that was an
[56:41] outsider
[56:43] not an israelite
[56:45] she didn't belong to the group but she
[56:47] was an outsider
[56:49] presbyterian methodist or something she
[56:52] was on the other side
[57:09] but when she
[57:10] heard name was rahab she was living she
[57:13] was a harlot but when she heard how god
[57:15] was in the pillar of fire and was
[57:16] leading them she said
[57:18] let she said let called out to god and
[57:21] she showed mercy to the spy that i came
[57:23] to look out the land but
[57:51] because she had seen the sign of a
[57:53] supernatural god
[57:58] and she served her god's writing her own
[57:59] denominations but when she saw that
[58:01] great supernatural sign

[1:02:47] mono brand that rahab didn't say
[1:02:50] let me see it got opened the red sea
[1:02:55] or let me see
[1:02:56] do you let me see him do something like
[1:02:58] that
[1:03:01] then
[1:03:02] how he hit the spice and maybe i would

[1:03:33] amen joshua chapter two josue capitol of
[1:03:36] those uh verse one
[1:03:38] uno
[1:03:40] um
[1:03:41] i'll just go ahead and read it real
[1:03:42] quick it says then joshua son of nun
[1:03:44] secretly sent two spies from shateem
[1:03:47] go look over the land he said especially
[1:03:50] the jericho so then
[1:03:52] they went and entered the house of the
[1:03:54] prostitute named rahab and stayed there
[1:03:56] josue
[1:04:09] amen just to give a little bit
[1:04:10] background of where she comes in the
[1:04:12] picture
[1:04:17] uh when joshua was called
[1:04:20] he was lifted with a similar um
[1:04:23] anointment like moses
[1:04:32] uh the bible says that he was filled
[1:04:33] with the spirit of wisdom
[1:04:38] and joshua we know he said josue the
[1:04:41] bible says
[1:04:43] um the the god told joshua
[1:04:47] as i am with with you
[1:04:50] or how i was with moses i am with you
[1:04:52] most you know moses was the one that
[1:04:55] received the promise
[1:04:58] viola promesa but joshua josue was the
[1:05:01] one that was going to take the point
[1:05:04] he was the one that was going to get a
[1:05:05] hold of the promises
[1:05:13] in order to experience the promise
[1:05:15] in order to experience that promise
[1:05:19] he had a he had an account he had to
[1:05:21] encounter with a rahab
[1:05:24] elsa
[1:05:26] he had a two cent he sent two spies el
[1:05:28] man
[1:05:30] just like we read
[1:05:32] and two then we're gonna go into jericho
[1:05:33] okay
[1:05:34] ahead
[1:05:36] and joshua sent this to spies to meet
[1:05:38] with uh with the rahab the prostitute
[1:05:44] you know and she was
[1:05:46] she was an enemy yeah era
[1:05:49] you know god uses an enemy
[1:05:53] to to to reach the promised land
[1:05:59] was a bridge to the promised land
[1:06:33] you know
[1:06:34] rahab didn't have a good reputation
[1:06:38] you know she wasn't accepted by her own
[1:06:40] people
[1:06:42] she was intercepted in her own society
[1:07:12] and she said unto the men
[1:07:15] i know that the lord hath given you the
[1:07:17] land and you uh and that you terror and
[1:07:20] fallen upon us and that are the
[1:07:22] inhabitants of the land faint because of
[1:07:24] you second
[1:07:35] we have heard how the lord dried up the
[1:07:37] water of the red sea for you when you
[1:07:39] when you came out of egypt
[1:07:48] we'll just leave it there
[1:07:50] it's crazy to think
[1:07:54] that a woman with this type of lifestyle
[1:07:57] esta vida a woman that name that has
[1:08:00] never heard of god
[1:08:02] has never seen miracles
[1:08:06] has never seen a sign of god
[1:08:22] and this story is very aspiring i mean
[1:08:24] yes
[1:08:25] peter because
[1:08:28] it's that type of faith
[1:08:31] that god wants us to have amen
[1:08:34] you know her faith changed her life fete
[1:08:37] de rabble cambio la vida it changed her
[1:08:39] story
[1:08:41] her final
[1:08:42] her final was to die as a prostitute
[1:08:48] but she recognized the greatness of god
[1:08:56] the story of rahab begins
[1:09:00] the bible says
[1:09:01] rahab was a prostituted
[1:09:19] she probably received the title rahab
[1:09:21] the woman with the faith
[1:09:27] the woman with the great faith amen
[1:09:31] and uh one thing um
[1:09:33] how you start
[1:09:35] is it one thing is how you start
[1:09:39] and another thing is how you end yo
[1:09:43] hebrews 11.
[1:09:47] uh verse 31
[1:09:50] this isn't the new testament also talks
[1:09:51] a little bit of her
[1:09:54] testament
[1:09:55] it says by by faith the prostitute rahab
[1:09:58] because she welcomed the spies was not
[1:10:01] killed with those who were disobedient
[1:10:10] no i can't
[1:10:12] i can't believe the rahab or you know
[1:10:29] lugar you know with all respects
[1:10:31] brothers
[1:10:33] i've been there and the pews as well
[1:10:37] with my mind elsewhere
[1:10:40] during the service
[1:10:42] you know when i should be giving god all
[1:10:44] the praise
[1:10:48] because he deserves it all amen
[1:10:51] because if it weren't for god
[1:10:53] i wouldn't have been here today
[1:10:56] i would have been lost
[1:11:24] yours nothing a limit no he uses those
[1:11:27] who want to be used
[1:11:30] you know what i'm going to finish with
[1:11:32] this
[1:11:35] in the message
[1:11:39] it says like this this fascinating i
[1:11:41] think of the
[1:11:42] i think of uh rahab the harley pienson
[1:11:46] she had not she she had never seen
[1:11:48] israel
[1:11:50] but she heard pero
[1:11:52] and she hid
[1:12:02] her own people and everything else
[1:12:08] she never said
[1:12:11] wait till i hear joshua preach sometime
[1:12:16] let me join my conception my conception
[1:12:18] after i hear him preach
[1:12:34] if
[1:12:50] you know you cannot change where you
[1:12:52] come from
[1:12:54] you cannot change what you've been
[1:12:56] through
[1:12:58] but you can't change what happens at the
[1:13:00] next moment
[1:13:16] that's all you
[1:13:26] along with all those great people
[1:13:30] no
[1:13:37] you know
[1:13:38] by faith the prostitute didn't perish
