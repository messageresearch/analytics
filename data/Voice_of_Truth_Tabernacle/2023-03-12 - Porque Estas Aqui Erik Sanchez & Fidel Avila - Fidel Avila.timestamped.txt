[30:21] one of his Visions is one of his
[30:25] purposes his greatest purpose is is
[30:30] the beautiful Plan of Salvation
[30:34] it's the plan restaurant first children
[30:41] how many of us
[30:44] have experienced salvation
[30:52] [Music]
[30:58] but I've been saved by faith
[31:03] another question
[31:06] ask your neighbors
[31:09] what was I saved for parakeet what was I
[31:13] saved for
[31:17] sorry you know
[31:19] dios God
[31:22] didn't save Abraham from Earth
[31:27] just because he was a good looking or a
[31:30] good fitment
[31:33] just because he wanted to save him
[32:28] for
[32:30] his glory
[32:34] and what did God save you for
[32:38] eign
[32:56] for that right
[33:02] I believe that's one of the greatest
[33:03] purposes God has for us
[33:06] God Saves us to worship Him
[33:10] to glorify him
[33:13] they say he says
[33:21] talking about worship and he said to
[33:25] worship is
[33:27] in part doing it with you with your
[33:30] mouth that's a part of it
[33:33] the majority of our worship is
[33:41] through our testimonies
[33:43] it's offering our love is
[33:46] giving a reverence
[33:48] it's putting ourselves
[33:58] put myself by your service
[34:01] how many believe it that way
[34:06] Jesus
[34:12] Corazon
[34:16] is
[34:18] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[34:20] Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
[34:22] all thy soul and with all thy mind
[34:24] that is a purpose Brothers
[34:28] principal and I believe that ought to be
[34:30] our principal purpose our main focus
[34:33] look
[34:38] s
[34:40] and I think that a true worshiper he's
[34:43] going to worship and espirited and
[34:45] spirit and in truth he's going to
[34:47] worship him
[34:50] in the tribulation even in the darkness
[34:55] the true Son of God
[35:01] we're going to worship Him
[35:04] it doesn't matter if it's hot
[35:09] it doesn't matter if the time
[35:18] we're created for that safer that
[35:22] look
[35:26] dios God
[35:30] a new momento at one point
[35:33] or at one point he's going to let the
[35:35] enemy lose
[35:37] so he can take us through a certain
[35:39] tribulation and this happened to Joe you
[35:43] know the story of Joe
[35:45] he was a blessed man
[35:48] he had everything
[35:52] was fine with this everything was fine
[35:55] with his wife everything was fine with
[35:58] his health
[36:08] the dragon was there
[36:11] and he asked him where do you come from
[36:15] and he says I come from going to and fro
[36:18] um across the Earth and our brothers
[36:22] say in life scissors he feels
[36:26] comfortable on this Earth because
[36:28] there's a lot of sin
[36:31] man kills man
[36:34] there's a lot of unbelief he lies this
[36:37] Earth
[36:38] and God tells him
[36:41] have you considered my servant
[36:53] apart from Evil he he imparts himself
[36:55] from Evil is it
[36:57] I begin to meditate
[37:02] there was just one that had set himself
[37:04] apart from Evil
[37:07] rise righteous and fearing God
[37:41] of the world
[37:50] don't touch his soul
[37:54] saying goes
[37:56] he doesn't waste any time
[37:59] he begins to touch him in his material
[38:01] things
[38:02] afterwards he takes away his children
[38:09] and what is it that job does
[38:12] he's tribulated

[38:19] even then he's still gone and he he
[38:21] rents his garments
[38:23] he shaves his head yeah
[38:28] and God gives he says
[38:32] I came from my mother
[38:35] and I'll leave in other words
[38:40] and I'll leave this world the same way
[38:46] material

[40:13] not to a certain point
[40:15] basically speaking he had him
[40:19] the devil wanted to blur his vision

[41:23] how could he bend that man over
[41:26] son he wanted to blur his vision he

[51:59] many people have been deceived
[52:04] christianism many people think
[52:06] Christianity
[52:09] is
[52:11] a bed of roses
[52:17] that's not the Christianity I know
[52:22] the Lord said this
[52:25] in the world
[52:29] you have affliction
[52:39] he said that in the world
[52:47] you have affliction
[52:52] something that I love that it says

[53:08] I have overcome the world
[53:17] in the world you have many afflictions
[53:22] Paul and Silas were in prison

[53:29] Pere is
[53:31] but they were really not imprisoned
[53:36] you in this morning
[53:40] you might feel that you're caged in
[53:43] now you're in a
[53:47] prisoners
[53:52] maybe you're bound
[53:55] maybe you're under those bars
[53:59] and you know one thing
[54:04] why we can't make it to our purpose
[54:06] because many times
[54:10] is stopping us
[54:14] we will never advance
[54:41] on this Earth
[54:45] we will never advance
[54:49] I like Isaiah it says

[55:15] to see the brothers
[55:18] did you see how great our pastor
[55:20] preaches
[55:22] there's nothing wrong with that that's
[55:24] good
[55:26] what is the point for me to see God in
[55:29] my past
[55:30] if no one can see God in Me
[55:34] to see God in someone else
[55:38] [Music]
[55:47] walking in flesh
[55:51] thank you

[55:58] your creator

[56:02] I don't know who has told you
[56:06] that you're not good for anything
[56:09] I'm not sure if anyone's told you that
[56:13] but I don't think it's coming from
[56:15] somebody
[56:17] greater than the one that's speaking
[56:19] here
[56:21] he is I am God
[56:24] your creator
[56:30] nobody gives anything for you
[56:32] but here it says I am your creator
[56:36] I have formed you
[56:39] before you were born
[56:41] he is
[56:53] what do you have inside he knows
[57:05] foreign
[57:41] [Music]
[57:55] that what's inside me
[57:58] yeah
[58:00] now here's the detail
[58:04] he knows what's in you
[58:07] do you know what's in you
[58:13] those brother Fidel know what's in him
[58:17] for game birds I'm speaking what I'm I'm
[58:20] not speaking
[58:21] I'm letting the Holy Ghost guide me
[58:24] I'm just letting the Holy Ghost flow
[58:28] I Believe what my brothers
[58:32] the Holy Ghost is working in somebody
[58:34] I'm not sure who
[58:38] but he is working in someone
[58:40] you know one thing brother
[58:44] God's children
[58:46] are different
[58:53] I'm going to tell you one thing yeah
[58:56] I spoke with brother Edward many times
[59:00] I didn't ask to be a Christian
[59:06] maybe someone identifies here
[59:10] I never asked
[59:13] I never asked to be a Christian
[59:23] [Music]
[59:51] didn't let me
[1:00:20] as much as you want to go to the world
[1:00:27] what else can I say about this
[1:00:32] sometimes we want to run
[1:00:34] we want to run
[1:00:42] he's odd
[1:00:45] I remember brother Familia I had my
[1:00:48] family
[1:00:49] they Rejoice
[1:00:52] I wanted to dance with them I wanted to
[1:00:55] be with them
[1:00:56] I had cousins
[1:00:58] that would use drugs
[1:01:01] there's a cousin we went to uh parties
[1:01:04] with
[1:01:05] he would go to the restroom
[1:01:09] and he would come out with his mouth
[1:01:12] crooked
[1:01:14] wiping his nose
[1:01:22] God never allowed that
[1:01:25] all right
[1:01:26] and you say because you're a good
[1:01:28] birthday then no no
[1:01:31] he simply didn't let me
[1:01:36] guess
[1:01:38] maybe he thought that if I got that I
[1:01:41] would go um
[1:01:43] there was something strange in me
[1:01:45] brother
[1:01:46] there was something odd
[1:01:56] I
[1:02:03] thought I was the son of this world
[1:02:09] but I couldn't fit there
[1:02:16] why are you here
[1:02:21] why are we here brethren
[1:02:28] seven you know
[1:02:32] foreign
[1:02:40] I believe we're very different
[1:02:45] we're very different brother

[1:02:51] special person
[1:02:53] my grandmother
[1:02:56] if I've seen God
[1:02:59] existed and I believe God exists was in
[1:03:03] my grandmother you know one thing
[1:03:05] brother
[1:03:06] I remember
[1:03:21] I would come back home earlier
[1:03:24] and you know what that old lady was
[1:03:27] doing
[1:03:28] she was kneeling
[1:03:31] kneeling
[1:03:36] there was a rug there are carpets all
[1:03:38] concrete and dirt
[1:03:41] she spent hours praying
[1:03:44] foreign
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:44] you can
[1:04:46] [Music]
[1:04:55] you know one thing brother
[1:04:58] is the
[1:05:01] subscribe
[1:05:04] my grandmother has been ill physically
[1:05:09] I do feel sad
[1:05:12] sometimes because of the separation
[1:05:15] pero
[1:05:18] located
[1:05:19] but I believe that's how the Christians
[1:05:21] should be
[1:05:23] my brother told me he asked my
[1:05:25] grandmother
[1:05:27] I think my sister-in-law
[1:05:31] if she was ready to meet her maker meet
[1:05:34] her Lord
[1:05:35] as she said she was
[1:05:38] do you know why brother
[1:05:41] because what we preach
[1:05:44] we've heard it well we speak manifest
[1:05:52] many say I'm going with him I'm going
[1:05:55] with him
[1:05:56] but not right now Lord not right now
[1:06:00] why don't we say
[1:06:03] or why do we say that because we're not
[1:06:06] ready
[1:06:11] came to search for a bride
[1:06:14] a different bride is
[1:06:25] and brother John spoke about Abraham
[1:06:32] yeah
[1:06:33] spoke about Abraham right
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:38] but I enjoy when
[1:06:40] Rebecca is mentioned Rebecca
[1:06:47] Is Us in an actual time
[1:06:53] brother Branham says
[1:06:57] I love how he says that in English I
[1:07:00] wonder
[1:07:03] antes
[1:07:08] I wonder why Rebecca came before any of
[1:07:11] the other girls
[1:07:13] don't you ask yourself
[1:07:16] why you yeah
[1:07:19] why are you different
[1:07:23] why can't why
[1:07:25] even if you walk
[1:07:29] everything inside
[1:07:32] why you can't go
[1:07:35] why
[1:07:40] is
[1:07:44] did you know that Rebecca and Isaac were
[1:07:47] blood relatives
[1:07:49] here's the key porque State because you
[1:07:54] know don't belong in this world
[1:07:58] is different your DNA is different
[1:08:04] we have different dnas
[1:08:10] we all have the DNA of Jesus
[1:08:15] they say
[1:08:17] he said
[1:08:23] for blood relatives Primos cousins
[1:08:31] and the pride of Jesus Christ is a blood
[1:08:34] relationship with him foreign
[1:09:33] the angel
[1:09:36] when to prepare Rebecca
[1:09:46] no because Rebecca was good no
[1:09:50] because Rebecca was a blood relative
[1:09:54] she was Kinsmen Redeemer yeah
[1:09:57] there was something inside her
[1:09:59] manifestation
[1:10:34] you don't know
[1:10:42] you preach about Jesus Jesus how do you
[1:10:46] know Jesus existed
[1:10:48] it is written
[1:10:52] look brother
[1:10:54] says
[1:10:56] sometimes we don't know many things
[1:11:00] but one thing I do know
[1:11:03] that is written
[1:11:06] that he overcame
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:14] circumstances
[1:11:16] it doesn't matter
[1:11:18] if he overcame
[1:11:22] I will overcome
[1:11:27] it looks Church
[1:11:30] you are different
[1:11:36] I I feel like I'm I'm a repeater well
[1:11:40] that's who I am different
[1:11:45] I'm an eagle
[1:11:47] I'm an eagle
[1:11:49] yes
[1:11:56] now the question is what is leading you
[1:12:02] is
[1:12:06] Santo
[1:12:10] is
[1:12:21] that is why I today I believe that those
[1:12:23] who have been born again those that are
[1:12:24] filled with the Holy Spirit are
[1:12:26] connected with God and are Guided by his
[1:12:28] Spirit that's why they act in such a
[1:12:30] peculiar way
[1:12:32] why are you here
[1:12:36] what did you come to see
[1:12:42] because
[1:12:43] if you came to see something good apart
[1:12:47] there's nothing else good
[1:12:51] you know that's why many people go back
[1:12:54] to the world
[1:12:55] because they come even and see problems
[1:13:01] sometimes the brother does this the
[1:13:03] sister does that
[1:13:05] I'm living because there's only
[1:13:07] Hypocrites
[1:13:09] that's all right
[1:13:11] bye circumstances

[1:14:52] if something is stopping you
[1:14:57] you could okay I believe he is here
[1:15:05] the same holy spirit that guided Rebecca
[1:15:10] I believe it's the same holy ghost that
[1:15:12] is here
[1:15:14] that same Holy Ghost came
[1:15:17] and prepared the place
[1:15:21] for me
