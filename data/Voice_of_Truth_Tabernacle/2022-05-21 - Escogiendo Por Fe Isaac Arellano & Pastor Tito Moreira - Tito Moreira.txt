oh [Music] foreign [Music] see [Applause] [Music] god bless you brethren i'll see my school china man can you listen it's nice to be in the house of the lord one more time [Music] you can turn with me in hebrews chapter 11 verse 23 1733 hebrews 11 23 by faith moses when he was born was hit at three months of his parents because they saw he was a pr proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a reason for a of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward of by faith he forsaked egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured and see in him who is invisible amen lord jesus christ we thank you for one more day and for giving us the opportunity to come and speak your word and also be with my brethren that are so special which are the children of god may you flow through this building may of this service help me uh jesus and my brother and my pastor brother tito amen in the name of jesus christ amen buen tomas ascientos for us to understand a little bit about moses uh we need to go back and exodus 1 8 says amen gracias now there now there are rose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph is and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mighter than we yeah we're gonna and i'm going to change to my my first language so i can help my brother a little bit and uh for context if you read exodus one and two exodus it talks about the death of joseph jose and it speaks how when joseph was in power because joseph had favor on them and but now joseph passes away and now there's 400 years of slavery in egypt so now there's a new pharaoh a new king joseph are you nuevo faraon are you nuevo rey that knew nothing of what joseph did yo jose but now the this pharaoh sees how many hebrews there are in egypt and that's where they began to enslave them because they feared that they would empower the egyptians amen now amen that was a little bit of context amen just to not make it longer his father's name was abram [Music] however you want to say it okabe we're gonna be speaking about moses i know we spoke about faith already now there's faith again in moses there's so much more and other brothers will have the opportunity to speak of other things well i can explain the word of god and so if faith disagrees with science and we must make the choice that moses did plus a rewarder of those that seek him digitally are perishable now we would think of moses and this great time of his life we read becca and the historian of his birth and how god cared for him historian how god cared for him at his birth but there comes a time in moses life if we read we find out that he was the son of pharaoh's daughter amen pharaoh of egypt he was next in line to be fed so as he's looking around as he comes to the age of accountability he's seen through the palace with pharaoh el mira en el palacio and imagine distinct moses and the pharaoh seen through the windows of the palace and all that pharaoh saw it they were seeing the same slaves but pharaoh was seeing the slaves that were building egypt and moses as a young man you know all that the slaves were good for the pharaoh that's the way the egyptians looked at the hebrews or the children of israel yes but when moses looked it out it was different how he looks he knew he was looking at the people of god he didn't see them as slaves they were god's chosen people and maybe sometimes here we see some of us enslaved siendo esclavos but just like moses he went to deliver a message we also have the rights of rights is i would have jumped at the opportunity to become pharaoh because i was i would have been pharaoh's daughter farah what would you guys have done queue look you'll still be right you're next in line to be the king that's tough right to become the king of egypt to have the whole world at your feet but what a foolish thing says brother branham that young when moses chose to take his place with the afflicted and suffering people of god god's people [Music] moses saw beyond the pleasures of sin but now what if pharaoh could have seen what moses saw he saw the sufferings of the people he knew what the price was to paint but by faith he chose it rather than to have the pleasures of sin and [Music] brethren abraham gave him the choice and god gives you your choice the word says chooses they who you will serve what abraham said he saw the opportunity to graze his cattle opportunity to have a better and fatter cattle and as they move on we find um [Music] he was a stranger but he was a smart man he said maybe i'll become the chief manager fields he didn't see himself escaping to a little city somewhere for his own life he didn't pharaoh would have seen his nation drowning but moses saw it and it wasn't by science but moses saw it by faith [Applause] everything that he did was by faith just like god promised abraham dios promised fuera moses had rather el preferio when he could have been the son of pharaoh and half the glamour of the world he'd rather be the son of abraham than to be the son of pharaoh the son of abraham the despise los que es los espressiados then to be the pharaoh de ante and the king but moses had to make a choice your faith has to fight the fights just like moses didn't fear the wrath of the pharaohs and i'm going to be closing if you want to stand with me brother and this is very important here if we can all pay attention this is of course when he sees that he is defeated he wanted to give moses and the children he said brother branham says that he said all right i'll tell you what i will do you all just stay in the land and go out and sacrifice to your god but that's the way the devil works he wants you to keep things he says you can be religious this is why don't you go over and join some church you don't have to do all these other things go here go there they don't have to do that over here but he don't want you to get out of the land just bring the world in with the church the devil's trying to bring the high things of god so that they can mix them down here the people won't look above this they just look down here they all es la misma cosa get out of the land salga de la tierra amen our brother titus will be coming mr mano tito god bless you [Applause] the type of the lord jesus christ hey with me moses represents represents the lord jesus christ moses when he was a child and he was a baby they tried to kill him just like the lord jesus christ when he was a baby they tried to kill him uh [Music] had received news send out to kill all the the the young males all that were all that were being born he asked that the midwives [Music] and then she lets him go los nilo she [Music] in the same river where all the other young babies were dead but she was trusting in the lord that's right believing that god would take care of him and god took care of him god guided him to the house of pharaoh's daughter where she was bathing [Music] she names him moses significa because moses means brought out of the water out of the water and as he is growing in the house of of pharaoh no pharaoh's daughter knowing so that they would take care of him and they bring a jock bed so that she would raise moses so moses he grew up with two options that he came for he that he was a hebrew the queen that his he had hebrew blood there was the one of egypt it means you have two options yes that's right so moses had options yes he had the options how many of us have struggled with those options i can imagine moses at the same time why do you want to be our prince as well is it not enough for you just to be prince of the egyptians that shows us that most and he thought he could remain in both worlds are you with me yes that's right now up to that point he had not made a choice and many of us especially especially because you've been uh father and mother tell you one and it's that all we're oh make your own election or i'll see you choice we're in church and we're living in both worlds he chose he had to be brought out of egypt when they found out he killed the egyptian to save the hebrew of his hebrew brothers he went fleeing to the to the desert to the wilderness that's where he had to make his uh choice yes what he would do there's a story about moses when he was a young child a baby the tradition of the stories of the hebrews they said that when moses was a baby he grabbed pharaoh's crown in this moment at that moment pharaoh became a little fearful you became a little worried he said this young child will perhaps will want to take my throne you know how we take these small omens or the symbols of the future and on the other side they put a a a a hot coal miner they wanted they wanted to see ciel if he would go after the gold corona or if you just wanted to see if he just grabbed that crown because he liked the shiny gold things or the shiny things because i i would call it that is lit up it it shines it is a it is a la story and the hebrew story says that this baby he was about to go get uh the ghosts and when he grabbed this hot coal he put it in his mouth it harmed his tongue to exodus and i want you to see what is happening why the devil is so scared of you making a choice this is exodus one verse 8. a new king over egypt which knew not joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of children of israel are more and mightier than we yo i asked myself if the devil can't see you further than what we can see el puede is do you realize that you realize that the devil is scared of you do you realize that the devil of what you are capable of [Music] but the devil knows it says behold the people of children of israel are more and mightier than we are come on let us deal wisely with them unless they multiply yeah if we recognize but it's not enough therefore they did send them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for feral treasure cities and they built for them treasures cities for pharaoh python and ramesses the more the devil afflicts me the more they multiplied and grew and they were greed because of the children of israel well the devil doesn't realize the more affliction comes to our lives the stronger the children of god becomes the devil when you choose god [Applause] jesus christ he chose [Applause] i you have to choose him [Music] until you choose him he saw what you would choose you were making a choice for him get to the final destination they sent him on the round now what the random says look how important your election or choice is important look how important your election is sometimes we say if god chose it then he's going to do it no sir if you choose him yo let's go here to the end [Applause] notice how important your election or choice is the musicians can't come forward man yeah it's important you still haven't made a choice you still haven't made a choice [Music] [Music] i choose [Music] when he made the choice [Music] [Music] he saw something [Music] you saw that there was more joy there was more joy [Music] anything that egypt could offer him you chose algo because he saw something [Music] sometimes we [Music] what am i not seeing [Music] when you make the choice [Music] it's something defining yeah it's definite yes that's right it is this is defining its deafness it's not one day yes one day no when i come to church [Music] it's not because i feel like coming all the time especially [Music] i [Music] because [Applause] [Music] i serve [Music] [Music] [Music] you have [Music] [Music] for eternity or the or the temporary idol make a choice for god or for yourself for [Music] stop questioning it just say this is what i chose yes this
