How great is our God give a hand of Applause to our Lord Jesus Christ amen how many happy to be here tonight such a good place to be the house of Our Lord amen amen if you could open your Bibles the Hebrews 4:15 you're going to be getting into the word of the Lord and for our title tonight we have titled it he understands and as a little subtitle that I gave it a call to battle amen if you could say Amen when you're there amen and it says like this for we do not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus give you thanks for this wonderful day you've given us to come and worship you and to hear your word we ask that you may help me and my brothers that will be speaking this evening may speak the right words that we may help the people that are here and that your spirit just may move among us we ask this on your name the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen so um just kind of what I'm going to be talking about is about temptation you see a lot of the times we think temptation is always bad but it has its good to it as well a lot of us see temptation as always failing always falling into the same things but I read something the other day and it says temptation is not sin but it is a call to battle amen how many were called to battle this evening amen you see in the bad sense of Temptation you know it means to tempt to seduce to entice and to pull someone away from God into the way of sin of self and and of Satan you see a lot that's usually how we think of of Temptation a lot of the times and it's correct that's what the devil's trying to do trying to pull us from God trying to make us feel like we are somebody but we're nobody without God Amen see Jesus was nobody without God and it says in the good sense it means to test to try it do not it does not mean to seduce into sin his purpose is not to defeat or to destroy the idea is not that one is tempted seduced en enticed and pulled into the into sin by the Holy Spirit but one is tested proved strengthened reinforced and purified through the trials of Temptation you see through the testing we are pulled forward when we overcome amen you see when the devil was tempting Jesus when he told them to turn the stones into bread and if I could get a water please he wasn't he knew that Jesus could turn the stones into bread he didn't he was he wasn't like saying that he couldn't do it he knew he knew Jesus could do it see but what he really wanted was for Jesus to feel that he was somebody to make a circus out of the Holy Ghost to put on a show for him you see if if he would have done it what would have happened because the devil knew he could do it right he knew that that was in him the power that he had but the devil just wanted to mess with him he wanted to have a show he almost wanted just to sit back and watch a Netflix showflix that's how a lot of times we are we just want to sit back and watch God do everything we don't want to put any work into it we don't want when Temptation comes a lot of the times the Devil comes I'm just going to give a little little illustration here I know my brother right here is not the devil but I know I could use them you see let's say Isaac comes to me Devil's using them just say he's a friend from school saying let's go out to drink and a lot of the times we're not strong enough and a lot of the times we're like well it's okay I'll just go drink can do and we fall that easily we just become friends and first we're like this right now we're like okay now let's go smoke some weed we're getting a little closer now let's let's go with some girls now we get a little closer until that sin that small Temptation turns into something big so now we're stuck together and we can't leave see a lot of the times that's how we are we're stuck to sin and like I said temptation is not sin called to battle amen now what happens in a battle have you guys ever seen movies of War of battle they're not just relaxing what happens before one of my favorite movies is hacka Ridge you see seeing them train they get their guns you know they have to do target practice they just don't send them out to war right away you see and God's doing the same with us he's preparing us when the devil tempts us we are ready for battle amen we are not weak but a lot of the times we think we could handle it so we go out into the world without preparing without listening to our parents withouten to our pastor to the ministers and we think we're ready and then that's when we fall into sin see we we see Jesus went out into the wilderness Wilderness wasn't some pleasurable place it was Desert it was somewhere where no one wanted to be it was hot it wasn't nice and refreshing when it was hot you couldn't have a cooler on you see but it was something something that he went through for us to show us that it's that we are able to do it you see I want to [Music] read a quote my brother brandom and it's it's in the message thou son of David have mercy on me God told them wait down in Egypt I give you that land but he didn't say I'll go out there and sweep it all out and garnish the houses and hang up the curtains and everything you all just move in see God's not going to do that for you God wants you to feel a little bit of some of some hard times you see the Holy Ghost doesn't come in all sweet all the time on the back until you you're not going to go through anything no but he keeps saying no they had to fight for every inch of ground that's right fighting and take by every inch but he said everywhere The Souls of your foot lands that's possession footsteps is possession that's the same thing today Divine Healing belongs to us the Holy Spirit belongs to us our property but you'll have to fight for every of it but brother footstep is possession just keep fighting and take it you see Brothers we got to keep fighting taking foot step after foot step we can't stop fighting because once we stop that's when the devil gets in and takes a hold of us amen you see brother brandom also says you see or before I read that you see a lot of the times we think oh because we fell we already fell into temptation we can't get back up again we think fellure oh I'm not going to come back to church we think because we fa we're not going to come back to church you see I thought about that sometimes as well you see I have struggles as well you guys might just be thinking know he's saying this so confidently but if I were to tell you my struggles guys might not even believe the struggles I go through but you see I say it confidently because I know who my God is I know that he could bring me out see brother brandham says as I was with Moses so will I be with thee although if I am trying and I fail now hear this God won't leave me you see I never had much confidence in anybody in anybody that's too afraid to do anything did you just hear what our Prophet said I don't know if you guys heard it when I read this this this surprised me opened my mind a little bit and he keeps saying I would rather be found a failure than too lazy to try i' rather be called a failure too lazy to try but I don't want to be too lazy to try I want to try my hardest try every way and if I fail I'm goingon to give back up again amen I just want to say a story before my time ends see there's this story that I heard from this brother and it really it was really a good story story and it's real life as well you can look it up a boxing match that lasted 49 rounds over two and a half hours just P boxing his name was Joe Janet Joe Janet and s mcvea s m but I just want to focus on Joe Janet you see they lasted 49 rounds and Joe Janet fell to the floor Jo Janet 27 times 27 at one point they didn't he was going to get back up again they thought he was done the count was almost over theat the count the Bell was about to ring the ref was about to call it but next thing you know he gets up again you see he got up so many times now hear me Brothers he got up so many times that his opponent on the other side on the 27th time did not want to keep going against this guy now think about that this guy was went beating him the other guy's face was probably destroyed I could even recognize them that's how sometimes the devil has us right we can't even recognize ourselves in the mirror but the crazy thing that surprised me was that his opponent didn't even want to come back out to fight him you see the Falls won't really matter at the end of the day how many times you fall God's not going to look at that but God's going to look at how many times we get back up am surprising thing about this man is not how many times he fell how many times he got back keep getting back up those demons that are surrounding us they're not going to want to get out of their Corner anymore they're going to start getting afraid they're going to be like we don't know what's up with this guy don't know what got into him we don't know what touched them I don't know what it was but when you're God touches your heart and you keep falling you're going to keep getting back up again you see Babe Ruth Babe Ruth hit 714 home runs but he struck out third 1,330 times but what's the bigger impact we never hear about his strikeouts but we hear about his home run I tell you don't stick to your failures get back up amen amen I leave you with [Applause] that may please stand to rest a little bit epesi Ephesians [Music] 1:4 following the ministry and the life of our Lord Jesus Christ and in Matthew 4 you find he is tempted Ephesians 1:4 says like this according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Romanos and Romans 8:28 29 you find Jesus receiving the holy spirit in the Jordan River the lamb reuniting with the Dove and the dove begins to guide the lamb says like this did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed in the image of his son that he might be in the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Jus Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God is for us who can be against us you may be seated m we see Jesus Christ going out to the Wilderness and after fasting for 40 days the devil came and tempts him there his ministry was just starting it was the beginning of his ministry he was already adopted as son God has recognized him as Jesus Jesus Christ as his son and his ministry just started we listen to brother Bram tell us that no one should preach the gospel although he be filled with the Holy Spirit we also find in Matthew 10 that Jesus sends his disciples to go preach even when the Holy Spirit did not come unto them and had not been filled my point here is to the youth and every man and if I speak to the men I also speak to the women because the woman is part of the spirit to the man so I want you to understand that every single one of us every single one of you has been called to the gospel just like Jesus Christ was called Charles brother Bram talks about his brother Charles that he was called to preach although he never preached so every youth and every single one of you has been called to the gospel and being called to the gospel you will be tempted just like Jesus Christ in Romans 8 he he gave his own son he spared not his own son so we find ourselves in this situation since we are born God has called us he called many prophets from the womb of the mother and we see here that he predestinated us before he formed the world he called us so he had called every single one of you as he has called me he's also called you every single one of you women to stand beside your your man that's why many times us as adults we try to give advice to the young lady the young man to look closely at the man she's going to choose as a husband usband and to the man to the wife that he will take and we ask ourselves why we find that the women has a decision to make as she is single God is her [Applause] Lord but when she is about to choose a husband [Applause] although God is over all things she has to be a willing to give her she has to be able to submit herself to that man willing to let that man lead her to eternal life when you you see it that way you see it's a very serious topic the same way as us as a church when we come to a moment to choose a pastor we must make sure you as youth that the lady you're going to marry that that lady be filled with the Holy [Applause] Spirit young lady with the man you will marry that he be filled with the Holy Spirit why because it will save you from many problems we find the the Lord Jesus Christ here being tempted by the devil this brother Bram says that those three Temptations He first tempted his flesh next he tempted his sight and lastly he tested his pride every temptation that we have is a trial we have we must go through I took a class to be a teacher in English and one thing they showed me in that class because they taught us when we take a new group we make a test right away and the test was to know their English level it was not to approve them or fail them many times Temptation shows you to know what stage at in your growth if you keep falling in the same mistake it's because you have not taken the full you haven't taken the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord why we resist many times as women that her husband be our be completely our Lord many times as husbands we don't take advice from our women I've have taken note that that is my mistake every time I have been tempted and I have fallen it's because I been taken him by his word and that's where we all fall that's why it's necessary and the beginning of the preaching of he told it is you must be born again but that's just the beginning one has not received the Holy Spirit but has received the beginning and has has begin this journey as long as you haven't been born again you are still in the flesh you keep falling in the flesh repeating the same mistake once over and over again because you haven't taken him by his word what does it mean to take him by his word well that question have you accepted the Propet of this age brother William Mar brandom he has revealed all the all the Mysteries and he has said that the Wom and should not cut her hair and we do we do it we keep on doing it brother Bram tells us many things but we don't obey them so we have not been born again because we haven't B been born of the word that is being born again being born Of The World God gives you another nature because the nature we're born with will take you to make them same mistake a thousand times although we see the Lord Jesus Christ being tempted he was already adopted he was in the beginning of his ministry but we're taking it down to a level a little lower level or every day we're being tempted from the moment we wake up our our thought is to do evil and God disgusted himself when he saw in the times of no to think of man the thought of man was to con do evil but we think to do evil is to smoke is to no brothers is to disobey the word of God to do evil is word see how the devil has deceived us we struggle with many addictions as a young lady you also struggle a lot in your mind but we think that these Temptations sometimes going out with friends and listening to some music oh how much we like the music from the world we like that beat that makes us move I tell you that because I lived it and when we say a bad word we feel good but that is not the sin that's an attribute of sin how the devil is deceiving you what the devil wants you to do is the same thing he did with Eve in the beginning is to take you away from the word not from church not from church brother he's leaving you away from the word he Strays you away from the prophet he Strays you away from your daily reading of the Bible sin is unbelief and if you keep falling into temptation there is unbelief in you that's when you need to worry you need to worry then because when we St away even aeter from the word of God from a straight line 100 steps forward we'll be meters away from where we started just from one M millimeter from where we deviated so what was the devil trying to do with Jesus to deny the word stray him away from the word temp him like he did to Eve but he could not do it because he was the word can me the word although we understand he said it is but that word was already inside it was him and we as we have read we must come to be like that's why he predestinated us that's why finishing here when we were in his thoughts he created us and he created a theophany for us but we that are living presently here we can't go into we over Overlook our overpass this theophany as fleshly beings as weak beings but here we taste or we improve inch by inch there waiting for us God bless you [Music] Brothers God bless everyone it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we'll be a reading from uh Luke chapter 4 verse 1 to 4 yeah I I really enjoy a preaching to the youth you know you guys very special to to me uh and uh you know it's good it's good to to see you guys here uh Luke 4 verse 1-4 reads like this says then Jesus being filled with the Holy Spirit uh returned from the Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness says being tempted for 40 days by the devil and in those days he ate nothing and afterward when they had ended he was hungry and the devil said to him if you are the Son of God command this this Stone the stone to be become bread uh God may God add um blessings to the reading of his word uh you know when we uh look at the the scene here uh you know as a brother Enoch was saying it says that Jesus had been adopted you know by by God uh you know in other words uh the heavens were opened oh that the heavens would open this evening that they would open you know to each and every one of us yeah but I don't believe that you know God would open up the heavens you know and pour out his Spirit uh just so you can feel good for a moment uh because if you notice it says Jesus being filled with the spirit it says he was led by the Holy Spirit Into the Wilderness so he went from a high you know you ever felt that high you know when the spirit of God comes down and you just want to stay up there uh because it's a great place to be you see but when you're up there you see when you're on the Mountaintop oh you know brother Bram says no fruit grows on the mountain top it grows it it grows in the valley so he goes from The Mountaintop uh you know he goes down into the Wilderness and other words heaven was open but hell the jaws of Hell opened as well amen amen I I I believe that amen amen you know and remember you see he was led by the spirit amen amen he was led by the spirit if you are led by the spirit you have to be in the spirit you know when you're in the spirit you know how things begin to change I want to ask the youth are you here in the spirit because when you're in the spirit and you begin to see things that you don't see and you begin to hear things that you haven't heard are you see you begin to feel things that you've never felt oh that God would bring his spirit that there would be somebody here to receive his Spirit we just need one person here brother says God just needs one man surrendered with that Spirit where that Spirit can feel that person you watch what he does I was sharing with the guys in the back you know you can be so filled with the spirit because Jesus was filled with the spirit you see when he was filled with that Spirit there was no more room for anything else there was no more room for the devil because he was filled with the spirit you see you can get to a place where you are so filled that the impact that you make on the people around you they can feel it as well it it is there something that induces something else is something that is induced you see when the spirit of God comes down it provokes something it brings something to you or when you are in the spirit are we in the spirit thank you Lord when God or the Holy Spirit leads Jesus Into the Wilderness we understand that he's tempted you see and like Isaac was saying like Isaac was saying Temptation you know isn't a bad thing [Applause] you see Temptation it's actually a revelation of what you struggle with without Temptation you would never know of what your struggles are are you guys understanding you see so what Temptation does it brings out of what the flesh or what the inside of you sir what's in there that that's what Temptation does it brings out the struggle to your passions it brings out the the lust the desires and they brings all that out or what are you hungering for this this this evening what are we hungering for I was a young man one time so I know the struggles you see the struggles real but the holy spirit is real too it's so real it didn't care it didn't care to lead Jesus Into the Wilderness because it because God knew that that he's not he wasn't going to give it to Jesus just so he could have it and God doesn't give you the Holy Spirit just to sit in the church he's going to put it to the test because he knows that that's the best that he's got as a matter of fact that's all that he has because that's all that that we need to defeat the Devil that's all that we need we don't need anything else to defeat the Devil I want you to understand that the first Temptation he attacks the flesh you see because Jesus was a man he was all man he was tempted in all ways so he could sympathize so he could understand what a young man a young lady goes through he he he he went through all those things he was hungry he got sick you see he he knew what it was like to lack things amen that's that's exactly right so Jesus is tempted but to to make these stones into bread and Adam and Eve if you notice they were tempted as well but they were tempted in the Garden of Eden in a place that was full of fruit but Jesus is tempted in a place where there's nothing to eat where it is dry and there's not a church member in sight the pastor wasn't there or your mom wasn't there your dad wasn't there but the Holy Spirit he was there and he's here amen amen hallelujah God is good Brothers he is so good he did all of this in order to prepare Jesus for a public Ministry a more public than what it was so we go through a Temptation so that so that we are prepared for something public not to make a show or not to be entertainment that's not what it's for because you know what you let by the spirit you see it just it just does something to you it it brings it brings you into complete obedience amen amen you think we just need to get in the spirit and wherever God leads us and when you leave this place and when you leave this place this evening are you believe that the devil's going to be waiting because he's going to want to prove to see what you say if it's real or not that's so we got to be filled with that Spirit we need to get to a place oh I'm going to finish my story I know I left you know kind of halfway earlier but when you are filled with the spirit you see there was a you know this is a a famous person but you know they say that you know Arnold shener uh when he would uh go to the gym uh you know when he walked in there when he would walk into the gym but they say that the gymm would Elevate to another level because he was there now if a natural man maybe was not filled with the spirit I could Elevate these people to another level what could the Holy Ghost do could the Holy Ghost do could he Elevate you to another level that's right I believe he could do it brother brandham says this in the message the resurrection he said I believe that the holy spirit is here he's the one that fills us and our life is not our own but it's the life of the holy spirit in us that makes us Christians I believe that every fiber of a Christian's body is controlled by the Holy Spirit I believe that your eyes are but you can't help it when you look to see an evil but if you lost after it you already committed adultery you turn your head the holy spirit makes you do that is that right you might be tempted temptation is not a sin heing your temptation is sin it says you can be tempted Christ was tempted like we are but he never sinned so the holy spirit is God that helps us bear out the truth of God and we're ready to dread of all man amen amen I'm closing now when we talk about the Holy Spirit and E we see that God would not wouldn't send Jesus if he was not prepared God would not have sent or he would not have led Jesus Into the Wilderness if he was not prepared If he if he had not equipped him you know and we know that brother Bram says that God equips his men God equips his church he equips his sons and daughters you are equipped to do the work of Jesus Christ in this time I believe that and when I think about you know the years that have gone by It's been a 14 years January January 30th I gave my life to [Applause] Christ and now when I think about that moment and I think about how serious I took it and I think about you know the 14 years that have passed the struggles The Temptations the hard times the times I might have lost the battle [Music] and it wasn't because the Holy Ghost wasn't good enough because it is what happens is that we fall into temptation we fall into the lustly desires we hunger and sometimes we don't hunger for the right things we're not hungering you know for more of God we're not hungering for more of his word we're not hungry for the right things and that's why we fail that's why we fall it's not cuz the Holy Ghost wasn't good enough because I believe it is and I believe that if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost not a single one of us I would be here and I'm here because the Holy Ghost is good enough the Holy Ghost has brought me through when when when other people didn't help me when I was all alone when I was sad when I was depressed when when somebody else couldn't help me there times that the pastor can't even help you he can't always help you he'll be there for you he'll be there for you H but he can't always do it for you but you have to go through it and the Holy Ghost will bring you through he'll bring you through the struggles he'll bring you through the fights he'll bring you through the battles and you'll come out you'll come out Victorious and you say maybe I don't feel anything that's okay you don't have to you say maybe I don't cry like everybody else you don't have to you don't have to cry like everybody else but you can say God I believe you I believe you I believe that what you have given me is going to bring me through it'll bring me through the Temptation and it'll make me not a victim but Victorious I'll be victorious I'll get up one more time and I'll bring the fight every ounce of the Holy Ghost that I [Music] have we'll defeat the Devil we'll defeat the Devil any place any time brother bham says that he went to Jesus in Jesus's weakest moment [Applause] and Jesus still won he still won he was weak he was hungry but he still defeated him and you can defeat him too you may be you may feel weak you may feel hungry you may feel sad you may feel depressed the good thing is we don't go by feelings here we are led by [Music] faith faith in the Holy Ghost faith in the Holy Ghost I believe it do you the altar is open [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] fore [Music] I for for [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] your [Music] oh oh so so for [Music] [Applause] [Music]

can have your seats beautiful word we heard can take something with us amen amen God spoke to us in many ways very special ways according to Temptation or about Temptation about the times in which we're tempted we have a holy spirit we have a help we're not alone God sent us help that sent us the help that we needed sometimes we simply forget or we don't want the help I was remembering when we went to Israel if I remember correctly we went to the River Jordan first the Jordan River is in the desert and I think after that we went to this mountain where he was tempted and the devil tried to tempt us there the spirit of the devil was still around those parts and he tempted us with the food the Lord Jesus Christ with the food but the thing was that I I got upset um because some of us that were in that group they couldn't withstand the hunger when you get up this mountain they call it the mountain of Temptation and you go climbing and I think it's so tremendous that when you get to the mountain of Temptation there a restaurant there and I thought in the Lord Jesus Christ how the devil basically almost just put the food right there front in the mountain of Temptation where it's believe that Jesus was tempted there's a restaurant there where Jesus was tempted to eat and we're waiting for Brother Caleb group was with from New Mexico from Cruses for them to arrive and I told I told the group that was with we're going to eat with brother Caleb once we get off the mountain of Temptation there's a restaurant down there in Jericho and we're going to eat there and I went to go see where the incline was I went to go see the path of of where it led up to where the Lord Jesus was tempted when I came back everyone was seated at the table and they were ready to eat when I had just told them that after we got down from the mountain the thing was that they weren't able to withstand the Temptation brothers and I didn't withstand my anger so the devil tempted us in many ways I scolded them harshly and they seen me very angry still got off the M after after we seen all the sights of where the Lord Jesus was and then the devil tempted us with money and we didn't want to pay what they were charging us and some of us some of us left without paying or some of them so I was I was remembering about all that and I said how was it that we knew that the the Temptation was there but we forgot completely and we failed miserably sometimes that's how we are right the tempt we know the devil's there we know he's beaten us there before but we forget it's like we forget we leave the service know devil was out there waiting for us and we fell we fall almost into his arms we forget there's a Holy Spirit there's help for us we forget that he's he's going to help us and we fall brother Al brother Marsh we forgot we were we failed miserably there and that's how we are sometimes don't forget it leaving this place the devil's waiting the devil's waiting to tempt us ready he's ready to make us angry he's ready don't forget there's a holy spirit he's ready to help you he's ready to give you what you need go to the Holy Spirit there's food afterward sisters have prepared some
