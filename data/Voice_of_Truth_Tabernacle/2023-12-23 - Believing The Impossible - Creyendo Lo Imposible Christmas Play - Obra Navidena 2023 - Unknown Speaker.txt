instead of calculating what will happen if you go wrong you should just brothers were talking about something they said when we come to second service on Sunday they said there's not room for the people they said some of us has to wait back there so what's the problem Church what's the problem I hear of a little dispute going on but where's the faith where's the faith this morning can you call God on the scene there's nothing impossible if you need a church you got to speak the word of God because there's no more people that can fit in this place now the problem that I see we can't can't find any more souls right brother we going to put him so why not call him on the scene why not cry to him this [Applause] morning why not cry him this [Applause] [Applause] [Music] morning [Applause] [Music] believe old chains are breakable when we receive way you keep your promises if you said it we believe it if you said it if you said it we believe [Music] show of your word you we believe [Music] it you're you're yeah all things are when we believe an old chains are breakable when we receive the you keep your [Music] promises you it we believe it you you said We [Music] Believe if you said you're the man of your if [Music] you you're man of your we have this confidence you finish what you started God you have never failed you won start with me your [Music] in leader of the audio department so that's our live stream and our lyrics and that are on the screen I have been serving for five years now and I just wanted to share a Thanksgiving and small testimony about our new church uh when I started we only had a small room probably the size of like a walk-in closet um we later then the church and the brothers built a bigger room with some more space for us and it had a window this time that we could see um inside the Sanctuary after that I had this um desire this wish in my heart that we could have a space that was more inside the sanctuary or had a bigger window where we could feel more in the service and be able to to worship with the rest of our church together um as if we were in service and so when we were trying to purchase our current church I actually wasn't able tour the building and just was able to see their pictures but I could see that there was the the balcony there and that was really exciting for me imagining that we could be up there and feel really in service as it wasn't just the window anymore our first service that we had was um I remember this was a Friday service and to me just getting there it was a first ever service and that was just um I just felt super blessed and honestly it was emotional for me it was like a huge milestone a huge deal and I just felt so blessed to be able to call that Church hours and I just wanted to say a big thank you for allowing us to purchase this church and make it our own and make it our new home um and I am I feel so blessed and so grateful every time that um I'm up there serving and it has just been amazing just wanted to say thank you he closed his doors and opens doors where His blessings overflow he says be still and know that I am God and all that he asks is our trust I remember days throughout the years C because we didn't have enough space in our Sunday school department for our children to be taught properly in a classroom I used to pray to God if his will was not for us to build a church to at least give us a bigger building there were times that there were so many kids in one small classroom that it was hard for teachers and kids to move around I used to constant teacher Junior Youth and didn't a classroom at all they were thought in the kitchen in our pastor's office and if the weather was nice we used to go outside there were times where we had to wait for the songs to be over because we were in the kitchen and the sanctuary was in the Next Room and the sound was so loud for them to hear the lesson we had great times and great memories in our old church and even though with our lack of space we never never stop believing that God will open a way for us to walk through and he one day will give us the space that we needed one day unexpectedly I remember the day that reito called me to let me know that a church was for sale the excitement in his voice made my heartbeat so fast of happiness that day I came to my closet and made a sincere prayer telling God that having a bigger church was not a want but a need that this opportunity was a prayer that we were praying for years and I started giving thanks for what was to come little did we know that within two months God was going to work the impossible into possible I remember when Bill shows the building but hard wanted to come out seeing how big the classrooms were my eyes got watery because I could see our kids being thought in those classrooms freely and having the space that they needed God fulfill his promises all we have to do is wait and believe he works in ways we cannot understand I thank God that he still got and he still answers prayers he's the same yesterday today and forever God bless you once again we give you a cordial welcome we're g to uh make the presentation for the drama the play but before that we want to honor and glorify our Lord Jesus Christ and if you would please stand we are going to be reading a scripture it's in the gospel of Mark chap 10 verse 27 Mark 10 verse 27 says and Jesus looking upon them said with men it is impossible but not with God for With God all things are possible you may be seated throughout the history of the Bible and Humanity there have been men that have believed in the impossible and they have been common people like each and every one of us that have believed in the impossible we have the example of Moses the example of Noah the example of Abraham as well as Ruth but now we want to present to you a very special person and and about one year ago our church couldn't even imagine that we would have this building but because somebody believed because somebody believed God's word we have what we have we thank god brother it says in the message then Jesus came and called but impossible things are made real when God is took at his word the impossi is made realities when God is taken at his word the theme for the the play is believing The Impossible we know who our Lord Jesus Christ is but we also want to mention Virgin Mary as well because that person believed in the impossible and and and changed the humanity so I'm going to ask that the lights be shut off we will start the the play God bless you almighty God I want to understand you've shown me these things yet to happen and of a special person the Messiah for you have told unto me a virgin shall conceive and bear forth a son and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be Emanuel and Lord I believe the same Emanuel shall be this Messiah one day send Lord you have showed unto me he will were born in Bethlehem but Lord why will he be born in Bethlehem shouldn't he be born in a mighty City but I do suppose our Mighty King David came from little old Bethlehem and you showed me that he shall be from David's family line and Lord you call this Messiah with great titles such as everlasting God Everlasting father Prince of Peace and mighty God lord if I didn't know any better it'd be Blasphemous to call anyone but you with these names but you calling him in such manner only shows me more he comes straight from you but father in these Visions he looks to be like a servant than a king I see him opening the eyes of the blind Healing The Sick and Performing other great Miracles among the people so Lord if he's such a compassionate King who looks after his people why shall he be rejected I see these sad visions of him being betrayed rejected beaten and even killed Lord why will his own people reject him won't they see he has been the one they've been waiting for for so long oh but Lord you've shown me that this Messiah will be the perfect sacrifice to cleanse us of our sins and forgive us of our wrongdoings oh but Lord I'm exceedingly glad my visions do not end there for on the third day of his death he shall resurrect and the good news of his salvation shall come to every corner of the earth oh Father your ways and understandment are high above mine Lord even if in my mind it may seem impossible at times over the years years of being your Prophet you have shown me that you can do the impossible Lord I will continue to tell your people of what is Yet to Come and we shall wait for our Salvation even if it may take many many [Music] centuries is the stor Mar for hello Joseph Mary how are you I'm good how are you I'm good I'm just working on the house yeah it's beautiful what do you think it's beautiful I really like it thank you what do you think of the color I like it a lot I like how you how you really did your best and what you're doing thank you Mar it took kind of a long time but yeah no I'm finishing it up yeah it's great yes you want to sit down yes Joseph I was thinking earlier on on my way to the well about the sermon that we heard the other day do you remember that sermon yes I do remember where that that Rabbi where he took his scriptures from over in Genesis and exodus where he said that that Mo God met Moses as the pillar of fire and you know God he took such care of his people Israel that he did he always took them through every trials and every problem that they had doesn't that make you so happy Joseph to know that God is over were our great people it makes me so happy Mary it Thrills my heart so much how he went down there in Egypt this great prophet and showed great signs and wonders and Jehovah just being a provider just just brought the Israelites out to the Red Sea and opened it up and when the Israelites when they were hungry God blowed in coils Mary just for being a provider our Jehovah is a provider Mary and when the is isites when they were thirsty they spoke to a rock and from that rock they got water and when the Israelites when they were in sin when they were bitten by serpents God had Moses make a brass serpent to put it on a pool Mary that that's true but what was your interpretation of that Joseph well Mary my dear I believe it meant that there would be a sin a sin offering one day that the brass serpent the brass meant that the serpent himself was s already judged and the brass serpent was divine judgment and divine judgment would be upon one some day and would be an atonement for healing and my dear Mary that brass serpent meant that I believe but did you notice that he ruined his sermon after speaking of how great Jehovah is and all the Miracles that he does he says that God doesn't doesn't make Miracles anymore that the healing for the sick it just doesn't happen anymore but you know Joseph I could hardly agree with that Rabbi on that I know if he ever was Almighty he is still Almighty if he ever was Jehovah he is still Jehovah and you know why Joseph because he is Je Lord God Almighty he is Je oh god of [Music] creation the of GAD the Rock of Ages he is the god that he the and you know what Joseph I can prove it it says right there in Isaiah let me let me look at the scriptures here Joseph why don't you read the scriptures for today how about you go in and get it dear okay says unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God the Prince of Peace Joseph you're well learned of the scriptures yes what was the prophet speaking of when he said unto us son is born well Mary I believe he was meaning the Messiah the coming Messiah that the prophet Moses spoke of but how will this son be my dear Mary he will be made God he will be God manifested In the Flesh he will be made manifest in the Sun that he will create but what Rel will he have to God my dear Mary remember what Isaiah 7:14 says for that a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son and he shall be named Emmanuel meaning God With Us that's beautiful it is beautiful Mary I believe I think it's time for us to get ready for the synagogue okay let's get ready let's [Music] go l is that it was be some some sort of rock I'm not sure arel Gabriel fear not Mary for behold you will conceive and bear a son and his name Shall be Called Jesus what are you I am sent from God to tell you that you will give birth to a son and he will be the son of the highest and save his people from their sins knowing no man how will this be cuz I know not a man the Holy Ghost and the power of the highest will come upon you and cause you to conceive for with God nothing shall be impossible I am a servant of the Lord be it unto me according to your word I believe I believe I'm going to have that Son of God I'm going to have a baby and his name will be Jesus I'm going to have a baby I believe I'm going to have a baby I'm going to have a baby sent by God you believe she no she's crazy I'm going to have a baby who's the father God is true did you say the truth already no it is the truth please you have to believe me I feel bad for Joseph no why your life please you have to believe me please it's the truth please you have to believe me blasphemy no please it's the [Music] truth you have to believe me we never have we never will you're just a filthy Li true an angel appeared to me please no it's the truth no please you have to believe me it's the truth just a filthy liar Liar Liar Liar Liar [Music] Stone Esther Mary Mary what's wrong Mary just tell me what's wrong Mary you're scaring me tell me what's wrong I need to tell you something but I don't know if you're going to believe me just tell me what is it do you remember in the book of Isaiah where it said that a virgin would conceive the Son of God yeah I remember this may sound crazy but an angel appeared to Me an Angel yes an angel an angel yes Esther an angel appeared to me and he told me that I would conceive the Son of God you're telling me that an angel came up to you yes and told you that you would conceive conceive the Son of God yes Esther please you have to believe me I do I do I do thank you wait does Joseph know no he doesn't but in my heart I know that Elohim will make him believe and I'll pray that God will reveal this to him and make him believe the impossible thank you Joseph Mary I need to tell you something I'm so happy to see you I've been meaning to speak with you me too Joseph I was thinking for a wedding maybe for a wedding for the music have mariachi no Joseph I was thinking for that Mary that would be good for our wedding Mary no I need you to listen I was also thinking Mary maybe maybe for

Joseph Mary do you even listen can you even hear yourself Mary Joseph please it's the truth Mary you sound insane Mary how can you conceive a child knowing no man you're a virgin God will do it an

to Joseph you have to believe me please I'm sorry Mary I'm sorry but it's kind of kind of hard to believe you right now because maybe it says in the scripture but it's another thing to try to believe it in real life well it it breaks my heart that you don't believe me Joseph I'm sorry Mary if you don't believe me this relationship is over Mary Mary no Mary don't do this [Music] God I need you I don't understand what's what's going on with Mary I love this girl so much but she just comes and does this to me I've been a true servant of yours God I've obeyed you Lord and this is what I get help

Mary Mary Mary where are you what's wrong Joseph Mary I need to speak with you last night I had a dream what I had a dream last night and an angel appeared to me in this dream and told me what that you were the chosen one to conceive this child really yes Mary and I just want to say I'm sorry I'm sorry for all the pain and suffering that have caused you I'm sorry for all the things that you went

Yonder it seems to be the prettiest star in all of Bethlehem and it seems it seems to light up the whole village and I've noticed that it's it's fall follow us up till now yes Mary I do see it it seems to be something peculiar where it seems to be like the brightest he brightest star in all of the heavens Joseph we are both aware that this is all mysterious to the both of us yes but both of us being Believers we know that Jehovah has something in store for the both of us because he chose us and he chose me above all the wom in the world today to have this message concealed in my heart we have two baby sheep in our family new baby sheep what should we call it I think this one right here we should call him tacos nah too hungry okay you guys ready this is even better you ready are you

brighter than all these Stars hold on let me take a look look take a closer look zoom in more I think that will [Music] help I see it what could that possibly be I'm not sure but it gives me this weird feeling that's very odd I definitely think that's a sign of something what do you think we should do I think we need to bring out the Scrolls and study it to find out what that could possibly mean all right well let's get them out what do your [Music] for [Music] [Music] there's been a star of Jacob rise and somewhere out across among the Jews there's a baby king that's to be born and he will be the light that lights the life of every man who seeks it guys guys wake up wake up guys wake up wake up the the angel wake up come on wake up the angel he spoke to me I don't know probably like 4:00 a.m. come on the the angel he he spoke to me come on get up about the star that we saw are you talking about the star we saw last night that one okay that star the star he told me to follow [Music] it yes but I don't know where to he just told me to follow it come on pack the stuff let's go come on P pack the Frankenstein the mold the fur oh right that let's [Music] go [Music] [Music] d [Music] [Music] for [Music] sir do you know do you know about the king the king of the Jews King Herod who King Herod who's that the king of the Jews no have you have you heard of Herod no I've never heard of him no we're not no never heard of him well that's not only King here like I said I don't know but but we've traveled for two years looking for this King do you know come on you got to know something no that's only King here is King Herod well I mean come on we we've seen the star we've we've traveled for two years who you probably need to travel more well I mean the star L us here so this must be the place well keep looking buddy saying come come on I've traveled for two years God help us some way or another the the prophecy of Isaiah 700 years ago he prophesies about the king well you must have been listening to a bunch of Fanatics no to someone's Petty theology no no no we saw the star in operation we know that it's real and it's led us this far but we can't find it no more and this is the city of the king the days of Miracles are over there's no way we've seen the star well let's see what King Herod says about [Music] this can you please to stand because the king is entering this [Music] [Music] court now can you sit King Herod yes what news do you bring priest I have S I have found some Fanatics out here saying they are searching for a new king a king but I am the king of the Jews God Hearts bring them to me now so you're the ones talking nonsense in Jerusalem no it's not a bunch of nonsense why who are you why have you come here we came here because the angel he spoke to me he told me he told me of a king of a new king but haven't you heard that I am the king here the king of the Jews here in Jerusalem no and you're standing in front of him no no the angel he told me in the dream it was it was a baby boy it it can't be you silence silence be careful about the next thing you say to me I'll be merciful this time but I won't the second now tell me what was the reason you came here and what drove you to come here we've been following the star ever since it appeared to us in the east from the East a star you say yes how when did you see this star two years ago and we've been following it ever since to this town of Bethlehem so you traveled far from the East and then you try and came all this way to follow a star to show you this new king yes that's correct and you say there is a child a messiah you say yes the new king that sounds interesting does it well since you've traveled this far and you must be weary I invite you to be my guests of honor oh why thank you apprciate and while you're here if what you say is true I shall call in the Sanhedrin to tell me where this Messiah is born guards bring me the priests send me the priest the scribes Now read the scriptures I want to know where this Messiah is born I found it my king so where is it but thou speak but thou Bethlehem ephra though thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler of Israel whose goings forth have been from old from Everlasting so Bethlehem is it you did good so I have found this I know now where this Messiah is born you will he is in Bethlehem and since I'm also into this prophecy I will do you a favor and in return you'll do me a favor what's that since my place in here in Jerusalem go and search and diligently for the young child in Bethlehem and when you have found him come back and bring word back to me so that I may too may come and worship him also all right sounds like a deal leave thank you go now now to her Bethlehem I'll be waiting here for you until you tell me where this child is and when you and when I have found this new king this Messiah I will make sure that there's no other king of the Jews except [Laughter] me [Laughter] e [Music] them [Music] [Music] fore [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] said I wish we had more Mary sure now Mary said behold
