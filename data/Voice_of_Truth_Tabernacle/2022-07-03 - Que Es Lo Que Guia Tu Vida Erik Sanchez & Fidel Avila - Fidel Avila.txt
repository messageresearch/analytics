[Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] such a beautiful presence like that of our lord jesus christ god bless you all brothers christopher greet you in the precious name of the lord jesus christ also those that visit us for the first time i hope that you feel welcome through the internet brothers from california our precious brothers as well and all around the world you uh we just love you if you just open our bibles the book of proverbs chapter 11 um verse 14. proverbial proverbs 11 14. is the people fall but in the multitude of counselors there is safety let us pray eternal heavenly father we thank you restoring the man this title in the form of a question what guy's your life now the word guy or jordicho or better said the person the person a guide it's a guide that has to know the way he has to know where he's going is as a guide because he is chosen and he is prepared to undertake the work i that he would be a man of god first he has to first be a man of god [Music] we need men of god our church our families that eva or in other words eve adam already had a work it was to follow what god had told him and look at he says and there here was god unfolding himself now down into let us make man which was his son and let him have dominion over the cattle the field so forth now the man led the men that led the cattle and everything yeah this way call the sheep over to this pasture call the fishes to this water everything obeyed him entonces because i'm going to clean up this area maybe to the cattle you would guide them to different paths the perhaps maybe a lion would come up close and he would just caress him but don't take advantage of the smaller ones you are here to defend them [Music] i could imagine adam like that in one of his first offices guiding creation he gets lost consequence here and the consequence all the creation all the animals are lost as well because the guide nor was [Music] is a wonderful the prince of peace i could imagine that the devil was once again to the light and to the truth of his word amen because the father that gave it to me it's greater than all made [Music] it didn't matter that's why i know the holy spirit is my compass that is my anchor when troubles are on estrella he's my north star when i'm lost the holy spirit is my compass is that's the way the denomination is [Applause] as our pastor told us this morning his words [Music] yes there are in the message what will we do with this jesus called the christ the holy spirit is the compass and the north star is the word the compass only points to the north star and the holy spirit will only point to um to toward the word it doesn't make any other movements it has to line up with [Music] because also in this church leaders leaders we should continue praying so that god would rise up more guys but line up with the north star from from mexico to the united states i was about four years old and i i just i was left without the image of my father but it was the grace and mercy of god that through my brother estevan he rolls up a guide and i thank him you know young lad he would tell me you want to go out with me he's a kiddo and i would tell him yes i do he would say come on you got amigos and his friends would arrive up and down and in front of me there was there was a liquor store three or four itomando and then drinking and then when i saw that they would offer him a drink alcohol or or wine or liquor or it wasn't because i wanted you to be all up in the mix but i i wanted you to me don't don't allow anyone to put a gun to your head so that you would do no and i thank i'll be closing with this god bless you [Applause] [Applause] [Music] let's go to uh john 16 13. god bless uh the word our brother brought this this morning eric and our brother erica but when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all truth let's go to john um 14 6 26 marcel consolador but the counselor the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things we would be so kind as to be seated just want to thank our pastor with the trust he places in us not easy [Music] and that's how this message came about it was the guide and then i began to think uh how god brought me from mexico to the united st he needs to know what position he needs to know what position what his position is if god is restoring you whether you be man you need to know what your position is we're speaking on a guide but you know as a housewife you are also a guy for your children sometimes he focuses more on fulfilling the desires of his wife and he forgets what he was called to it was called to be a leader you know as i see that many of the the youth that are courting it [Music] how it okay i said okay to your children you are a guy with your life you're a true guy well you yourself are being 2022 [Applause] i have the the luggage ready i'm over here with my family can you imagine what kind of guide matrimony what kind of marriage this is the luggage is ready i'm [Music] fear enter into he did many things it will come out to help to lift him up because sometimes we forget that we were in a worse condition and very easily we opened up we're shown to be more likely than men to experience major uh depressive episodes you know there's a lot of depressed people even here in the church this [Applause] [Music] i was driving with my father-in-law and we were going to see a sister atita look you say uh separation of a of a marriage the people become depressed they think that because they're they think they're alone you know why because they truly haven't known can you stand so long but they're not alone you'll never be alone that was leading us from mexico to the united states i remember when he got lost men can get lost the man can fail that we went up our mountain it was about the third or fourth year we had no more water we didn't have any food the guide was lost i was uh i was a teenager about 16 years old and i remember brothers and i say it for for his honor so you would never think solo that you're alone that's a thought of the devil i remember when we were on the mountain and we were we come down you know and one of the brothers god and he said it was three of us and they took us to dallas brothers out of nothing that was this man and god but god has a purpose you could be when they came but he with all the pain in his heart he knew [Music] they began to complain so much about him or to him you always says wow hope they said well i say i say wow job so much things happen to him and i complained because somebody looked at me wrong something's wrong with me something's wrong with us shows me you're the condition because up to [Music] when because you're also a preacher when the trial comes to you you stay bueno para animal of the man and you're good at encouraging others but when it comes to you you have to remain friends you have to hold on [Music] [Music] brothers that is struggling [Music] i [Music] [Music] thank you lord may you just continue to have our faith grow [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
