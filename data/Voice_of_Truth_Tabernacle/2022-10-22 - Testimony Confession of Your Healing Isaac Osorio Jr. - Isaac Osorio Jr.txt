bless you brothers and sisters amen it's good to be among the saints that is a part of the message of the hour yes of this last stage amen the prophet of God said that this is the most glorious age but the scripture also tells us and I believe it's Revelation chapter three that the the loudestian church age this church is um says Amen to these things but because of their Works Thou Art neither hot or cold that's what the scripture says and we we might say oh we we do we do good works but in reality the Bible says that we're wretched Miserables blind and naked and we don't we don't even know it and that's the spirit that's the condition that this churches is in is but we're going to have to realize that we we can't play Church you know we're not we're not in a picnic [Music] brother says that we're in a battlefield the coming of the Lord is near and we have to overcome that that attitude that spirit with the loudest scene in church age for giving us the Revelation foreign amen yeah 107 capitulo and it'll be verse 19. versicolo and if you all have it you can say amen amen glory amen the word of the Lord says thus Allah then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions all that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing sacrifices amen let's give him Thanksgiving and giving praise for his goodness Lord Heavenly Father yeah I the first thing that I can say Lord is forgiveness I'm asking forgiveness for my failures because I know that I have failed you Lord God and Lord Jesus I said we may keep on moving forward that you may put me aside Lord God that you may speak through me Lord God you may sanctify me Lord God that may be a worthy vessel to use Lord God um that you may speak through not just the youth but the whole congregation whoever needs to hear this Lord whatever um thing that that I would say that will be against your word please forgive me Lord God lord Jesus I thank you Lord I ask it all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may be seated amen please forgive me for um I'm not I'm I'm not planning to preach them for so sorry about that earlier I'm not planning to preach tonight um I promise I won't preach um if you don't know me my name is brother Isaac Jr and I come from the city of Tucson and with me is my my dad my pastor um as well as my family and the part of the congregation there is my church Jerusalem Tabernacle Iglesia Jerusalem Tabernacle and we're very happy to be here we've been planning this trip to Colorado for three years now and every year we try to come but something impedes us but we're on God's timing amen amen um I would like to think and tonight I just want to you know just share my testimony with you with a uh a thought that follows it confession of your healing many and many of you know this already what happened to me earlier this year and I know that this church yeah Voice of Truth was praying for me and I will I would like um to thank you personally for praying for me earlier and um just to share for those that probably don't know what's going on this happened back in February of this year and one night um I was taking a really long just hot shower and it turns out if hot showers I didn't know this but turns out it makes your blood pressure go low you know and I was there for a while and that caused me to think in the shower in Latina and my mom heard the heavy thought on this on the tube in Latina and there she was calling my name knocking on the door yeah [Music] or more or less I didn't want to worry about it I will get random coughs and it would affect um and when every time I saw glad I couldn't really breathe and our cough and cough until I was sped off phlegm and then another thing is that it's good um I will get really itchy especially on my my legs and I was scratching them constantly to the point where I I start bleeding and another thing is that my watch will tell me that my heart rate is going too fast for for me not being active but I mean and I thought it was tripping and you know I just ignored it and another thing is that and I knew there was something wrong with me I didn't want to admit that there was something wrong with me because you know it was during the winter Olympics it's normal it's whatever it's normal and that was going on for about uh four months or so foreign the doctor told me that I had a giant tumor between my lung and hearts and there was little tumors around my chest and and then she said yeah it's cancerous and all the symptoms that I just told you match perfectly of what they told me the tumor was about six inches and it was putting pressure on my lungs and that's why I was coughing a lot I was blocking one of my Airways and and because of the rapid heart rate and that's why I felt it was bothering me in my ribs and when when they told me this this news my heart dropped hey I was in disbelief but when I when I finally came to myself I told myself I I just said no they can know no I don't accept it I I don't have nothing you don't think and and um I don't know if you caught it or not when I said I always I I said the doctor said I have this I never said I had it and from this day I don't claim I had it because I knew that the doctors can tell me whatever they find um but God has the last word and I would like to read a quote from our Prophet here it's from the message accept God's gift is symptoms is something like uh paragraph 14. symptoms is something like this is say tomorrow um when you go home now to your place the express agent will come up and say Steve are you missed though yes see I have a present for you all right what is it okay he hands over a basket or a box and you hear something hit in that box and you look in it it's a big box of snakes well you know no you don't well you don't want them things but you see I don't want them oh but they're yours somebody send them to you here's your name here's the name it's somebody it's somebody sent these snakes to you they're yours you have to take them now in one sense of the word they're yours in another sense somebody send them to you but they're not yours until you sign for them that you received them when you sign you receive them then they're yours but if you refuse to sign for them he has to take them back to the express company Express the express company has to send them to the one that sent them to you is that right well don't sign for nothing the devil brought we don't know no sir just refuse to have it I I just haven't got it devil you you take it all back that's all I won't have it refuse to have your sickness your arthritis whatever it is I just haven't got it by his stripes I'm Healed stand right on your ground and stay there God will bring it to pass no matter what it is just believe in him brothers and sisters sometimes we make it easy for the devil Diablo by accepting our sickness we signed the box and we don't even know it you know we sign a thinkiness from Amazon but it's the sickness from the Devils don't let that nasty devil come to your ear and say no problem oh it's cancer oh it's cancer no it's covid oh it's cold oh it's the monkey whatever oh it's a jungle yeah I don't I don't care what what name they put it let's be real now it doesn't matter how pretty it doesn't matter how pretty or scientific a name they put it we as message Believers of the hours no they're just demons from hell Jonah said that symptoms Alma I ain't Christian Brothers um I knew I knew when the doctor told me those words it's just lies of the devil trying to doubt my faith and do that try to doubt God okay and looking back at it you know as a humano I I had every right to doubt God to be angry at God for for letting this to happen but as a Christian Cristiano I have no right to question God over what he has done for me to be angry at him I don't understand that that I don't understand it or when people say I was mad at God you're mad at God Glory Hallelujah so because the tumor was was so big and and it was a lot of risk they kept me there in the hospital for three weeks foreign [Music] and something that the doctor said stuck with me um she said that this type of disease it's very common yes and no it's and no one knows how people get it and the I just you know that stuck with me and I just said man it's that stinking devil who else for for five rounds of chemotherapy um it was pretty tough um I still give him the honor and Glory yeah because um I've seen kids in the clinic that will get my chemotherapy where they would say that oh he has 21 rounds oh he's been doing chemotherapy for three years and and looking at my situation I shouldn't be complaining no sir thank you Jesus for being for you are rich in Mercy foreign I went through um I went through chemo for three months and a half and the first couple of rounds um it was it was pretty rough it was pretty hard foreign especially for my body I never experienced something like that is I would get nauseous um if I if I ate something during chemotherapy um I just I will be disgusted by that food and even from to from this day I still get discussed from certain types of foods forgive me Brothers um I can't eat Church's Chicken no more Church's Chicken I just can't no no no it's one of those things where it does in your body and but I I still keep pressing on and before my third round of chemo yeah um uh I was starting to endure it better to feel better especially physically especially and I started to go to church again I started little by little playing an instrument and um and there was this one time Jesus um this brother was going to come visit our church and he was going to come visit us on a Wednesday and he's an English speaker so they were looking for a Spanish speaker to interpret him and I'll just go ahead and say I'm not I'm not too good on Spanish I am practicing and to to to put myself out there I told my dad hey I can interpret the brothers and just to just to be better at it and when um I checked my calendar and turns out having chemo that Wednesday morning so so I said I'll see how I feel and I did the Kim in the morning um I and then I went to church that that evening and I felt great it was like you couldn't even tell I did chemotherapy I interpreted that brother and I can say personally that was the best interpreting I've ever done even from uh from both English and Spanish in English in Spanish and I you couldn't I just felt great that said um I I I was I noticed that my hair was kind of thinning out a little bit and I would see a lot of hairs on my pillow so I did my first buzz cut and and from and I would and from there um it started to thin even more uh my eyebrows were gone my eyelashes were gone and I'll be honest with you I I was I was insecure about it but that didn't stop me to come to church I always I would always wear a hat you know we can't wear hats in church but I still I still Worship the Lord like never before and finally after my my last round of of chemo it is and just to see how things are and they told me that all the little tumors were gone the big tumor that was near my heart and it's there as dead tissue yes and there was no um active cancer cells the cancer now that was a victory for the doctors I already claimed my victory foreign just to say it that way you're actually interrupt your Vibes and he likes to just come out and say Boo out of nowhere the doctor told me that I don't need chemotherapy anymore but they told me that radiation was an option for me whether I wanted to do it or not so they scheduled me for uh to talk to the radiology and the steps of radiation just you know just to have information about it and I told God before I went Lord if the doctor convinces me to do it then I know that you'll be with me for it if I'm not convinced well then I know that I'm done so I went to radiology and the doctor comes up and the way that he was telling me this information it was in a tone foreign and and and then um he was trying to he was trying to put the consent form the paper for me I was signing up in my face and I said wait a minute I just came here for information my doctor said that I'm done and can't just at least think about it and like that smile kind of like faded away he was a little disappointed and he was like oh well yeah you can think about it I'll give you my number so so in case you change your mind the opinion but but ask your doctor um is there a better treatment than radiation if there is a better medicine than radiation um you go ahead and tell me for it he was doing a sarcastic man let me tell you I don't need no dog to tell me what's better than radiation he could have asked me what is better than radiation from Emmanuel's veins so don't tell me that there's something better than medicine because his word says that I am the god that healeth all your diseases that's what my Bible tells us so I left and I just said Thank you Lord for that um I felt like if I was doubting his healing if I took it and never before I felt good about it I never accepted that lie that said that cancer is still there and the devil actually come around oh when they have like just a little bit pain here if I get just a little bit itchy oh it's coming back knowing that the devil lost again and I would just like to read just one more quote for you from from our from the message the angel of the Lord is from paragraph 36. it says time's up brother and sister in the name of our Lord please give me right now uh what am I trying to say to you that God who came out in the old days and Let the Church of God out of Egypt of the bondage into free has come down again in the same manner to lead his church spiritual out of bondage of sin first by the Holy Spirit foreign immortality sorry the Transfiguration of the human bodies to transfer them into the perfect image of the Son of God please believe with all your hearts can't make no one believe right I can only can only speak of my conventions is to be true and if I speak the truth surely God will confirm the truth and we'll heal the sick how many say Amen to that how many message believers do we have tonight amen would you please stand amen um you know I like to say give you thanks once more for your prayers it was a a very um hard to explain Journey foreign out of all people I never thought I would that would happen to me and I don't want to do this as uh to scare you or to or just as a threat but think about it what would you do if you were in my situation would you still praise God or would you run away be mad at God Parents what would happen if this happened to your child because this it didn't it didn't really um hurt me as bad emotionally as it did to my mom um my mom got hit the hardest for it you know when they when they told the news she was there crying next to the hospital bed yes and I just said mom come here I hold your hand and I just I just knew that it wasn't worth being sad about it so I just told her it's going to be okay Mom what would you do if this happened to you or if you were in the worst condition if that was involved I shouldn't be here but it's by the grace of God that I can tell my testimony for others are you ready it's toast at least two nights that to the point where you can say I'm ready to go the next morning if the Rapture happens in the morning I'm ready are you do you have that capability to say that examine yourself we all make mistakes every day we want to be human if we want to make mistakes have you truly tried enough I to keep going forward have you done have you done the three steps have you been Justified have you
