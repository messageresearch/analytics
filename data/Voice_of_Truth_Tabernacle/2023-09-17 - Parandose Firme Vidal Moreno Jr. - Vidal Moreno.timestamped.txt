[22:31] [Music]
[22:36] God bless everyone it was when
[22:37] negatollos it's good to be in the house
[22:40] of the Lord
[22:43] you know we come to see Jesus amen
[22:48] you know one of the things I've learned
[22:51] and I've read this I read this one time
[22:54] and I'll never forget it
[22:57] and uh
[22:59] so they say that when uh you know a lot
[23:01] of people criticize Judas because he
[23:04] delivered Jesus
[23:09] but that's what the people wanted
[23:14] that's what they wanted
[23:16] they wanted Jesus Jesus you know and I
[23:22] think that's what the people want New
[23:23] York is he took him to the real Jesus
[23:26] Jesus he didn't give him a substitute
[23:31] you know and if the preachers
[23:34] you know and and you know and the
[23:37] Christians could just give people the
[23:39] real Jesus
[23:42] you know the world would be a better
[23:44] place
[23:46] you know because that's what the people
[23:48] come to see
[23:50] you know we don't come to see you know
[23:57] people want Jesus Jesus and you know we
[24:01] want him to to be uh to be here
[24:05] and you know if you expected him to be
[24:07] here
[24:09] then he's here Anton says he's here for
[24:13] everything you need
[24:16] God bless everyone
[24:21] the people that visit us
[24:24] brothers
[24:29] and throughout the world
[24:36] let's open our Bibles
[24:41] uh to the book of
[24:43] Ephesians chapter sixes
[24:48] verse 13 verse
[24:53] we're talking about uh in our subject is
[24:55] Conquering yourself
[25:00] you know and uh for a title
[25:04] decided to title it uh taking a stand
[25:10] amen amen
[25:13] uh Ephesians 6 13 reads like this
[25:17] says wherefore take unto you the whole
[25:20] armor of God
[25:21] that you may be able to withstand in the
[25:23] evil day
[25:24] and having done all
[25:39] heavenly father father Celestia we're so
[25:42] grateful Lord this morning
[25:44] to be able to be in your presence
[25:48] it just brings a peace and a joy to my
[25:51] heart
[25:54] you know and and you know I believe that
[25:56] that's what the people want your crocus
[25:58] is
[25:59] they want to find that peace that
[26:01] surpasses all understands
[26:10] we ask that you speak to us Lord
[26:13] speak to our hearts
[26:15] we just leave here Lord rejoicing
[26:19] because we heard from you
[26:22] we put the service in your hands Manos
[26:26] you just see the needs of your children
[26:30] you just bless them Lord in an abundant
[26:33] way father
[26:35] we uh we glorify your name
[26:39] our Lord Jesus Christ
[26:48] uh
[26:50] you know when uh we uh talk about when
[26:53] we read the scripture
[26:55] you know it's uh it's one of those uh
[26:58] scriptures you know that's talking about
[26:59] you know uh you know in that chapter it
[27:02] talks about putting on the harm or a God
[27:03] and El context
[27:07] you know that you may be able to stand
[27:09] you know to withstand in the evil day
[27:13] you know uh I don't believe that Paul
[27:16] was just talking about his day
[27:19] I don't believe this
[27:22] Apollo just uh just talking about his
[27:24] day you know
[27:27] because I believe that we're standing in
[27:30] an evil day
[27:33] amen amen you know uh when you look at
[27:38] the war that is uh happening
[27:42] and uh and you know uh I don't believe
[27:46] that Ukraine you know woke up you know
[27:48] thinking one day that they were gonna
[27:50] have to uh go to war you know
[27:55] I don't believe that they were expecting
[27:57] that
[27:59] I believe that you know uh that uh
[28:02] Russia wanted
[28:04] you know uh was uh they just uh
[28:08] I mean they they obviously wanted to
[28:11] take over
[28:13] control but you know uh we all just you
[28:16] know maybe Ukraine was like well it's
[28:17] just rumors
[28:21] they're just rumors
[28:24] uh you know but they woke up one day
[28:27] you know and they were being invaded
[28:30] foreign
[28:54] when it comes to your home turf su casa
[28:58] you know that's that's when uh that
[29:00] that's when you you know what you're
[29:02] made of yes
[29:04] you know there were some people that
[29:06] decided to run
[29:08] there was some people that just that
[29:11] just took the first plane ticket out of
[29:12] Ukraine
[29:15] you know and then there was others
[29:18] that uh that
[29:21] that decided to stay okay
[29:24] they may not have known how to fight
[29:27] but they were going to learn
[29:30] amen amen and you know I think that we
[29:33] have to make it personal this morning
[29:36] you know because uh we've been invaded
[29:41] amen amen uh you know when uh when
[29:44] Russia went into Ukraine
[29:46] oh you know they went they only went so
[29:49] far
[29:50] because there was Warriors there there
[29:53] were soldiers
[29:55] you know they decided to take a stand
[29:59] you know they they weren't going to lose
[30:01] any more grounds
[30:03] but they had to stand up
[30:06] they had to stand firm
[30:09] you know and and uh you know one of the
[30:12] strategies
[30:13] that Russia has used
[30:16] is that the the uh what they took over
[30:22] you know they they put our minds
[30:26] landmines
[30:28] you know and I thought about that
[30:31] you know because when uh you are that's
[30:34] one of the award strategies
[30:37] now you know because when you uh step on
[30:40] a mine
[30:42] you know uh once you get off of it
[30:47] then you just it just blows up explota
[30:51] so you blow up you know so there's a lot
[30:54] of people
[30:55] you know that they're fighting this war
[30:59] you know and and they it could be their
[31:02] last day
[31:03] you see when you talk about walking in
[31:06] the fear of God
[31:09] I believe those soldiers are walking in
[31:11] that fear
[31:14] amen amen you know because it could be
[31:16] their last step
[31:18] and you know I believe that the devil
[31:21] Diablo you know he's invaded all right
[31:23] he's invaded our territory
[31:26] he's invaded our minds
[31:29] he's invaded our homes
[31:31] he's invaded our schools
[31:34] there's not a whole lot of things that
[31:37] he hasn't invaded
[31:40] But there Comes A Time in your life
[31:44] where you just you know you just find
[31:46] out you know that What You're Made Of
[31:50] you find out
[31:52] that you know you just can't take it
[31:54] anymore
[31:56] you know you could be like a lot of
[31:58] other people except foreign
[32:08] [Music]
[32:21] man amen you know in the Book of
[32:23] Revelations
[32:24] uh the Bible you know the first one on
[32:27] that list
[32:29] you know in the Lake of Fire
[32:33] is cowards
[32:54] [Music]
[33:33] they have everything amen
[34:01] and you know one thing that that it's
[34:04] always that always wanted to be
[34:07] I remember telling my mom one day
[34:10] I wanna I wanna be a soldier I didn't
[34:15] know what to do when I got out of high
[34:16] school like a lot of the youth you know
[34:17] I said
[34:20] you know and I wanted to go be a marine
[34:25] you know the Marine he he uh he's it's
[34:28] the only Branch
[34:35] you know that that knows how to fight on
[34:38] all three uh in all three terrains
[34:46] all three he knows how to fight on water
[34:49] landing area
[34:50] and I believe that the Lord Jesus
[34:54] has trained his soldiers
[34:57] to fight on all three
[35:13] the main reason I wanted to be a soldier
[35:16] is
[35:18] first because I didn't know what I
[35:20] wanted to do
[35:21] but second of all is because I liked
[35:25] obstacle courses
[35:30] and you know that's probably not a good
[35:32] reason
[35:34] because going to war is in the game
[35:38] that was but I really enjoyed it but um
[35:42] I was like I could be good at obstacle
[35:44] courses
[35:47] but not really realizing that that was
[35:51] an obstacle course that I might not come
[35:53] back from
[35:55] you know and I think that that's how uh
[35:57] you know many times when we decide to
[35:59] fight foreign
[36:23] it's like it's like a game to you
[36:25] foreign
[37:19] we see
[37:24] the struggle of of these two young men
[37:32] inside of of the the womb of their
[37:35] mother
[37:37] Genesis 25 22 says this is
[37:41] in the children's struggle together
[37:43] within her
[37:45] and she said if it be so why am I thus
[37:49] yes
[37:50] and she went to inquire of the Lord
[37:54] and the Lord said unto her
[37:57] he says two nations are in thy womb
[37:59] those naciones two men are people shall
[38:02] be separated from thy bows
[38:07] and the one people shall be stronger
[38:09] than the other people
[38:12] and the Elder Shall Serve the young
[38:15] girls
[38:16] amen amen who was this woman
[38:20] can anybody answer that who was the
[38:23] woman that they were speaking of here
[38:26] see
[38:28] it was Rebecca amen amen you know so
[38:32] there was this war inside of her
[38:35] you know that that Jenny was almost
[38:38] unbearable
[38:40] support it almost seemed like she'd
[38:43] rather die than fighting the war but
[38:47] because the struggle wins inside
[38:51] I want to tell you something Brothers
[38:56] you know a lot of times you know we're
[38:59] struggling you know and and we don't
[39:02] know why you know we think it's the
[39:05] brother at church
[39:07] we think it's your co-workers
[39:12] everybody else
[39:14] you blame the wife that God gave you
[39:18] blame everybody else
[39:20] but you'll never look at yourself
[39:23] you don't realize
[39:25] that the struggle is not out there amen
[39:42] I I that's what I believe you know I
[39:45] believe that with all of my heart
[39:47] you know uh the struggle's real la lucha
[39:51] is real too
[39:54] God is more real than your struggling
[39:57] he is more reality amen amen
[40:02] but you know when uh we uh we decide
[40:05] that we want to fight
[40:08] oh you know it just uh it's one of those
[40:12] things that we really have to consider
[40:13] amen
[40:15] uh you know because uh we have we can
[40:18] take a stand
[40:20] you know I I I but you know what what
[40:23] are you standing foreign
[41:02] why does he die why does he um why does
[41:05] he go to war
[41:07] but you know he's not the one that
[41:10] declared it
[41:11] he's not the one that declared Wars
[41:15] you see War Began
[41:17] because you know the devil I was the one
[41:21] that declared it
[41:23] he said I could be more than you
[41:26] I could be greater than you
[41:29] and so he decided you know to to go to
[41:32] war
[41:33] but you know Jesus you know I believe
[41:37] that in the very beginning
[41:39] you know that there was a bit there were
[41:41] some people back there
[41:43] foreign
[41:59] [Music]
[42:09] so
[42:20] [Music]
[42:26] we made the choice
[42:28] at times we just you know we we have to
[42:31] hear the word to know that
[42:35] so you got to take a stand
[42:38] man you see but when you take that
[42:40] stance
[42:41] oh you know there are certain things oh
[42:47] you know what they need to be thought
[42:49] about
[42:52] you know in order to begin to fight
[42:57] you know because we can be in church
[43:01] yeah I want to read I want to read
[43:03] Corinthia Philippians excuse me
[43:07] uh chapter 4 verse one
[43:12] Philippians 4 verse 1.
[43:16] and it says this it says therefore my
[43:19] brethren
[43:20] dearly beloved and longed for
[43:23] my joy and Crown it says so Stand Fast
[43:27] in the Lord my dearly beloved asike
[43:30] Hermanos
[43:36] uh you know I I like what he said so
[43:39] Stand Fast in the Lord
[43:43] you know I I in the Lord
[43:46] because you know you can be in church
[43:50] and not be in the Lord
[43:53] amen amen you see it when you when
[43:56] you're in church
[43:58] you know that's a good place to be
[44:01] but that doesn't mean you're in the
[44:04] right place
[44:06] there's been a lot of people that have
[44:08] been in church
[44:10] that doesn't mean they've been in the
[44:12] Lord
[44:14] you're not in the Lord
[44:17] then you're really out of position
[44:21] you're out of place foreign
[45:23] you know like we don't we don't realize
[45:25] is that we may not like it
[45:28] it may not be comfortable
[45:31] you may not you know you may you may not
[45:34] it's not enjoyable
[45:36] but you know that's where God
[45:39] that's where God gives his children you
[45:42] know the greatest Revelations
[45:45] amen amen I believe that I believe that
[45:49] God he wants to give you a revelation
[45:53] where you are
[45:55] where you're standing of what you should
[45:58] be doing
[45:59] he wants to give you purpose he wants to
[46:03] give you Joy he wants to give you peace
[46:15] you have to give him the right away
[46:18] but you have to let him guys yeah
[46:25] but when we do it
[46:32] but when we
[46:35] when we say we want to do it
[46:40] the first thing that happens
[46:43] is that you begin to complain yes
[46:47] you know you wanted your life changed
[46:51] you wanted to be transformed
[46:54] oh you wanted God to do great things in
[46:57] your life
[47:04] oh well you're gonna have to you're
[47:06] gonna have to work foreign
[47:51] as my dad
[48:00] it wasn't so much that people couldn't
[48:02] say it that bothered me although it did
[48:08] but I think what upset me more than
[48:11] anything
[48:13] uh was that I wasn't like him okay
[48:17] and I didn't want to be like him you
[48:20] know
[48:21] I I I I hated the fact that that I had
[48:24] carried his name
[48:27] and uh and I was not like him at all
[48:32] you know and uh you know I think there's
[48:34] a lot of people here
[48:36] young men young ladies
[48:39] even adults Cristiano
[48:49] and you may have grown up in church
[48:52] and you don't fully understand what's
[48:54] happening
[49:00] why couldn't I been just like everybody
[49:02] else
[49:04] well you know you clench your teeth
[49:11] foreign
[49:17] because you got the uniform part down
[49:20] foreign
[49:29] [Music]
[50:18] [Applause]
[50:20] foreign
[51:20] foreign
[52:20] territorial
[52:57] you see that's not taking a stand
[53:00] because when you take a stand
[53:03] are you stand firm but you hold your
[53:06] position
[53:08] and when the general says
[53:14] amen amen
[53:21] it kind of going back to the story of my
[53:23] father
[53:25] you know he was uh he was pretty rough
[53:29] rudo and uh you know I resented him for
[53:33] a long time
[53:35] you know many years went by
[53:39] you know I was just a just a little guy
[53:42] on muchachito
[53:44] and uh
[53:46] there was uh I was telling the brothers
[53:47] in the small groups as well
[53:50] [Music]
[53:54] you know
[53:55] when I when I would fall you know as a
[53:57] young man
[53:58] you know playing around and whatnot and
[54:02] meaning I scraped myself up
[54:06] and uh you know just like any any of
[54:09] five six seven-year-olds
[54:14] for whatever
[54:17] you know first thing you do is you cry
[54:20] okay but you know my dad he would look
[54:24] at me
[54:25] and he'd be like son
[54:28] if you don't get up
[54:32] and I get there to pick you up
[54:35] it's gonna go a lot worse
[54:39] and I found out
[54:41] that he wasn't lying okay
[54:46] and uh you know I resented him a lot for
[54:49] that
[54:50] one thing I learned how to do
[54:53] was I used to I used to clench my teeth
[54:57] and I would hide my pain yes and you
[55:01] know I would walk away
[55:03] before my dad could get to me
[55:06] and uh I would go find a place to cry
[55:11] because it hurts you know it hurt
[55:15] because I didn't understand
[55:16] and you know he used to tell me you used
[55:20] to tell me this all the time
[55:21] he'd be like son
[55:23] he's like you may not understand what's
[55:26] going on right now
[55:29] but when you grow up
[55:31] he's like you're gonna find out what
[55:34] this was all about
[55:36] you know I just wanted some comfort
[55:40] you know and I I didn't understand
[55:44] yeah I you know I I remember when my
[55:47] daughter was riding her bike
[55:51] and uh
[55:53] those words came out of my mouth kind of
[55:55] yes
[55:58] and she fell and she was barely starting
[56:01] to learn he said
[56:03] and uh you know she started wanting to
[56:06] cry
[56:07] I was like
[56:10] I was like because it's gonna hurt more
[56:12] if you stay down
[56:14] my dog my wife was like she's just a
[56:17] little girl
[56:19] I was like yeah that's right
[56:22] you know it it was just kind of one of
[56:25] those things that was that was instinct
[56:26] to me foreign
[56:53] you you just you just gotta get up man
[56:57] because in all reality
[57:00] staying down
[57:02] you're staying downward somebody can
[57:04] just kick you around
[57:07] the devil can just do whatever he wants
[57:10] with you
[57:13] he'll do whatever he wants to as long as
[57:17] you're on the ground
[57:18] because he knows that there's not a
[57:22] fight there
[57:23] there's not a fight there if you're just
[57:25] on the ground
[57:27] although although you know it hurts but
[57:31] you gotta get back up you can't just
[57:34] stay there you can't just stay on the
[57:36] ground
[57:43] and you get to the point
[57:45] where's you either run back
[57:48] or you stand up and fights
[58:17] take it foreign
[59:25] foreign
[1:00:01] exactly
[1:00:03] you know one of the things uh I'm posing
[1:00:06] now yes
[1:00:10] one of the things that I've
[1:00:13] I've learned throughout my life
[1:00:16] in this walk
[1:00:19] in this in this war
[1:00:22] you know uh
[1:00:24] it's
[1:00:26] it's real
[1:00:32] you know uh
[1:00:35] I just uh
[1:00:38] I think a lot of us you know May
[1:00:40] may be able to identify
[1:00:45] you know with with the story Historia
[1:00:48] with my story
[1:00:50] you know a lot of us here are wounded
[1:00:54] a lot of us
[1:00:57] maybe what your dad did
[1:01:01] maybe what your mom did so
[1:01:06] what your brother or sister did
[1:01:11] you know
[1:01:12] if you're like that is
[1:01:15] you know there's a war going on inside
[1:01:22] and uh
[1:01:23] you haven't learned how to deal with
[1:01:25] that yet
[1:01:28] you don't fully understand
[1:01:32] why it had to be that way
[1:01:35] uh you know what
[1:01:39] when I think about those things
[1:01:42] you know I've learned through my life
[1:01:45] you know that there's people okay
[1:01:48] personas there are people that that are
[1:01:50] gonna do more than others perhaps
[1:01:55] you know how uh I'll put our pastor in
[1:01:58] this example
[1:02:01] you know he does so much mucho
[1:02:05] but God made him that way
[1:02:09] you know and he's taking a good attitude
[1:02:13] towards it is
[1:02:19] you know and he stood firm on his
[1:02:22] colleague
[1:02:24] but he's not the only one that has a
[1:02:26] calling
[1:02:28] we all have a call
[1:02:31] what are you gonna do
[1:02:33] you know what where's you gonna go
[1:02:36] are you gonna are you gonna Retreat
[1:02:39] you know after you promised God
[1:02:43] that you would live for him
[1:02:51] that you would be the one to go into the
[1:02:54] fight
[1:02:56] that you would go into the fire okay
[1:02:59] no for your brother or for your sisters
[1:03:05] like you would be the one who said no
[1:03:09] you promisedo
[1:03:12] it was you
[1:03:18] nobody else promised it
[1:03:20] I remember when I promisedi
[1:03:26] that I would stand for him
[1:03:28] and I did it behind the pulpit
[1:03:32] oh because I was tired
[1:03:34] because I was tired of living the way I
[1:03:37] was living
[1:03:39] I was tired of of just of just trying to
[1:03:42] guess my way through life
[1:03:47] you know just just guessing maybe this
[1:03:49] is what I should do
[1:03:52] maybe this is what I should do
[1:03:55] that and it was constantly wrong
[1:03:59] I would just it would just blow up
[1:04:02] take a step
[1:04:05] just blow up yes be hurt
[1:04:09] it got so bad
[1:04:12] I couldn't even say the right thing
[1:04:16] couldn't tell my wife the right things
[1:04:19] couldn't tell my kids the right thing
[1:04:23] could you tell my mom the right thing
[1:04:26] solo
[1:04:31] I found myself
[1:04:33] a wounded
[1:04:37] and then you know
[1:04:40] looking back
[1:04:43] you know what
[1:04:45] some of the things my dad did Papa
[1:04:50] they weren't all bad
[1:04:52] because like every time I fell
[1:04:56] there was something inside me that
[1:04:58] wouldn't let me stay down
[1:05:02] that I just had to get up
[1:05:05] because I knew
[1:05:07] I knew that if I stayed down
[1:05:10] it was gonna be worse
[1:05:14] man and that's what he was trying to
[1:05:16] teach me as local
[1:05:17] there was going to be times
[1:05:20] where he wasn't going to be there
[1:05:24] but you know what
[1:05:26] if my dad could see me today
[1:05:29] I would tell him thank you you know my
[1:05:33] dad still lives
[1:05:34] you know if he ever sees this
[1:05:38] I want to say thank you
[1:05:41] because every time you told me to get up
[1:05:44] every time it hurts
[1:05:47] every time I went to cry by myself
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:01] he was teaching me he was teaching me
[1:06:05] the way
[1:06:06] of a soldier
[1:06:08] yeah it's not gonna be easy
[1:06:11] it's not gonna be easy
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:20] I'm still fighting
[1:06:25] and you know I've lost some battles
[1:06:30] and I want some too but
[1:06:33] you know
[1:06:35] I'm not ready to give up
[1:06:38] I'm ready to continue
[1:06:41] I'm ready to keep going
[1:06:44] because I haven't seen the top yet okay
[1:06:47] I've not seen the top yet
[1:06:50] you can reach the highest mountain
[1:06:54] and you haven't seen what God can do
