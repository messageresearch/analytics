I'm living them so um uh I wanna just I felt you know or led by the spirit to speak in English because that's how I identify myself with the youth for Humanity English not my first language I got a tank brother Bernie for teach me English uh brother Bernie yeah oh he forced me to learn it um if you see me cry a lot kind of ignore me ignoring me just I'm so thankful with God for saving me Salvo so um I know you're standing here and um I asked brother titos that what would you like me to speak about it what are we talking about the judges and I said okay okay well well you just tell me one you know because I noticed that you already spoke about one the first three judges right this is up to you you know it could be something you say Samsung said that's me right there yeah I will identify myself with Thompson and basically what I want to do tonight is my testimony testimonial through the life of sensor so let's go to Judges 13 chapter 13. and then we can start on on the third uh Birds comments and my friend here Isaac Hill was saying in English and then in Spanish in Espanol uh this is and the angel of the Lord appearance to the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and bear is not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son continue our Quest noveles now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing is shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the wound and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines heavenly father father celestial I'm just being obedient thank you for thy Grace gracias thank you for your mercy gracias thank you for allowing me to get to know this this uh part of the Bride graciasport Lord I'm really in love with them as my brother Laura now I ask you to work through my Lord might say something out of your work only that might help you people uh it's called these things in the name of the Lord I was I had the opportunity on on Sundays right and I was telling them a little bit about my life I was born and raised in the message right um since I remember I always heard about brother Branham and about brother Bernie is and so many other Ministries and and I see that that this is just kind of like with with this Samsung it's about the same thing with Samsung is you know um if you've read the whole 13 14 you know all those chapters that talk about sounds I'm gonna just condense all that uh you know he was born under a bow you know it was that word Nazareth Nazarite Nazarite you know and he was promised to conquer like the Philistines you know um but he had a weakness he didn't he didn't even know that he had that wish still things happen and that's what happened normally happens to the youth yes no sometimes we think that we're so strong I always expect we like to brag about it you know and and it will look in our lives and it's like I got no weakness what was that and then we we just like search our life and we we think like we have no weakness is what might not know of you know like we might not know of but the devil knows or weakness and as I remember and I would say this story uh just to leave a brother Bernie's house you know I used to live there so I remember brother Bernie telling us because we used to help them in everything we used to sometimes cook because wash the dishes taking the elderly to like like you know going to their houses bringing them to church and taking them back to yeah but that was not enough for brotherberg I remember he was telling he used to gather like five of us like five guys at the table and he was like oh my God what am I going to do with you guys man like a girl can do like like would you guys fight with the Five Guys do it you know I knew it was just like Sally God didn't call the women amenities no so I had to bear with you guys and that was tough yeah that was tough because we always trying to please the man of God and I guess that's the the feeling that the Son of God has always turned to please God but when he sees the men of God he wants to please that me or help that ministry as I've seen a lot of you guys doing that with brother Jesus ministry and I really I love that yeah because I see myself fact that you know when we used to death brother Bernie okay so here's Samson Samson known that he was the son of God he was an Israelite israelita you know he knew that God was always on his side and that's the way we feel yeah as Sons and Daughters you know sometimes we want to walk a little bit ahead of God no but he always pulls or ears right so here we see Samson and and then later on down to you know a couple of verses down down to 13. we noticed that he had a he he had a girlfriend that was not Israelite israelita he was she was a Philistine and her parents told Samson Samson out of so many girls from churches well you're looking out there foreign now he had a plan and God was working through that plan too you know that's what the Bible says and then we find out you know that things didn't work out as he planned it man killed some Philistines and when he went back the girl that he it was about to marry La muchacha que Seva con quesar it was already in somebody's else's man yes right and then I see that cow that was a downfall for Samsung and Samsung later on we notice and we can see that his weakness was women and when and I I want to talk to the guys right now and later on I want to talk to the ladies but every single one of you are called to the ministry you have to believe it you're called to sir so just keep that thought in your mind so here we're fine that Samsung had a purpose God had a purpose all right so we sometimes don't we don't realize what the purpose that God has for our lives but now here is Samson and why did I say that all of us are called to the ministry because brother Branham says on uh it says why are people so toasted about in the message preached in 1966. this element is it says uh um on the quote uh 15th this uh it says I notice in the scriptures that were it money was that were it money was the prophet Balaam who sold out his gift to goath on account of money when Balon offers so much money many of you are acquainted with the story what did Brother Brian was trying to say like basically that was what balum fell for for months okay and we always have heard of that right like there are the three things that men fall foreign I remember one day brother Bernie called a couple of the of of the youths and he told us I need you guys to get married so and this is what we're gonna do yes sir I want you guys to look upon all the girls from church and picked three ladies yes and then for a month you guys gonna be reading the message and while this time ernesta Tiempo you guys gonna be praying to guide you to choose one girl out of those three and it says because when brother Branham to preached that message they said the choosing of a bride he never mentioned pick one and then pray about it they had to be some or few then you know so he could actually pick one out of him and that's what I want you guys to do yes again for a month foreign and brother Bernie told me okay that's not the one I had in mind yes I know it's lucky it's like you already knew okay yeah okay so what I'm trying to tell you is how sometimes how we insert our own thoughts to God's thought one more time how we in search yes so things didn't work out we broke up she broke up with me that was my first girl ever Novia and that was so devastated to me and now at that time I was a youth president for Phoenix Arizona Phoenix at right at that point I didn't know what Depression was and for a year I fell on depression brother Bernie just kept me working and I told Brother Bernie I don't want to be the youth president anymore I'm not even helping the youth what do you keep me on that position is it like just hang in there you know just hang in there you know um like my dad used to say oh son you're just drowning on a glass of water you know and but at that time it didn't feel like it yeah but what I'm trying to tell you God has a plan for you that guy has the plan for you guys now now out of those gods that God call us I mean the guy those guys that go brother burning call you know on that time Los Muchachos and one of them is the brother brother I think is going to be here like in the next week like in the next like Sunday we used to call in Colombian the Colombia the Colombia you're telling his story but it was so devastating for me that definitely I I couldn't help the youth anymore I went straight I mean I stopped going to church I knew brother Bernie was and you know he was my pastor and then I started dating a a girl from from from the world things didn't work out uh that either God brought me back to church and not start helping brother Bernie more than I ever did right so and I thought that was on my uh that was really strong in the message but when my dad passed away Papa that was that was a blow that uh man knocked me out SFO um and I went to see brother burning one time I wanted to talk with him you know and when brother Bernie saw me he just told me to wait and then he says okay now you can come hello and when he the first words came out of his mouth was who exalts himself shall be humbled shall be exalted I won't speak to you the woman I'll I'm gonna call you later I was kind of like what's he talking about all right I'll wait baby seven years went by and he never called me but seven years later I was in the world doing drugs going places that I never thought that would have ever been yeah oh my I couldn't recognize myself the devil had blinded megado I thought that I was getting stronger foreign foreign instead so I look at at Samson being all defeated there with no eyes because he gave his heart before God and I understand now why brother Branham says that you gotta love God before your girlfriend my dad was my all to me but when he was in there I didn't know what to look up to you know see what I'm saying okay because God wasn't there guys was not the first thing on my life so I see Samsung they're all defeated youth Holiness one of the first things that you do when you stop coming to church you start looking for parties I already know all that about and I was just reading brother Brown he's saying that they threw a party and let's start saying okay Fiesta so they can make support out of Samson but I said on deported so here's Johnson son people making fun of Johnson they threw a party and I was just telling my brother oh bro oh Hermano now that I look back in my life to all these parties that I went to see me being defeated see what I'm saying I thought I was going to have fun but I was the one that would make a mockery of peruse me you don't see it like that that's how I see now that uh I went through all that so the devil is making fun of you every time you go to a party to see a Son of God defeated that is that's what it's all about around but see that so I was there and don't say what I saw and when I was in that condition I'll start thinking back your comments are what brother Bernie told me and I started looking at my life and I I was kind of like what Paul said on the on the Epistles I can brag about myself I was born I was the Son of a Preacher I was the son of a pastor I was under one of the best uh teachers that's ever been over in our time which is brother Bernie I was there under his shadows and look at the condition that is what I'm saying to you do not extend of falling under the cloth of the devil amigo so you think you're strong God cannot use do you recognize God is not with you nothing nothing yes I understand you don't have to pass through a world we did it you don't have to listen to your parents or listen to me at least me so being in that condition I start thinking what broth Bernie said about me well he told me that day and he was right every single word he was right and then I'll start thinking why he never called me and then the Holy Spirit told me that's what my said let's speak to Santo was it brother Bernie what was the Holy Spirit to through brother Bernie and I understood Anton says that it was the Holy Spirit and I understood also but now it's time to go back that he was the one calling me back [Music] oh my God I worked five straight years of my life for brother Bernie that's not the way he pays me back so God told me you did that for the man and I said I'm sorry Lord as for that so Anton says I remember one more step there's no return so I decided and I just quit my friends everything is so that I couldn't face my pastor okay pastor I said no it's not the time yet I feel so ashamed of things I'm pretty sure you already knows all about it so I see Samson in this condition that's why when he said Lord wants more time that was me on that condition so I remember um that we went to a youth camp Anthony God touched me there we've been back to Phoenix and um I got baptized even though I knew that already been baptized before okay but I was doing late night now uh now and I knew what I was doing okay I was really repented of the things that I had done foreign and I did Eloise and um I remember that day um uh just knock at the door and I said I would like to see brother burning see uh it was different this time because I used to leave a brother Bernie's house I could go in and out at will yo is you know but uh at this time it was different I was asking for permission and he said yeah everyone said it's okay you know you can come in yeah and before I would ever say something he was so happy I heard that you got baptized this is and he says in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh my God he was so happy and I could see the uh uh I could picture the prodigal son you know going back to his house Dad I remember that a brother a brother that um used to um help him you know used to help brother burning it got there uh kind of like at the same time that I did yeah and brother was so happy that he says like do you know him he said did you know that he just got baptized so that's how happy a pastor gets yes yes one of his chips come back to his Vlog so brother but let me tell you this juice you don't have to go through that is God called you to be Ministers of this gospel but always keep in mind that the devil is just right there waiting to make a mistake and that's all it takes that's all it takes the next thing you will remember seven years down the road ten years down the road yes I know 20 years down the road [Music] and what gives you after you salvation a good wife I started looking for a girlfriend before I start looking for God don't make the same mistake don't make the same mistake that I did do not look for a husband or a boyfriend before you even look for God okay today talking to a customer working as a barber yes also the old me
