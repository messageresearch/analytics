[Music] senior okay not anymore [Music] restaurants [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] yeah hallelujah hallelujah this is [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] hello [Music] this morning so good right Brothers [Music] now we can understand brother Branham a little bit when he says [Music] we're going to be receiving our pastor [Music] the word of life [Music] [Music] seen him on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah knows [Music] yes [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you one brother foreign foreign is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your shielded houses and this house light ways now therefore the state the Lord of hosts consider your ways is bringing little ee but ye have not enough you drink but are not filled with drinky clothe you but there is none warm and ye have Earnest wages and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put into a bag with holes [Music] came to little and when you brought it home I did blow upon it why save the Lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and you run every man unto his own house therefore the heaven over you stayed from Dew and the Earth is stayed from her fruit is and I called for a draw upon the land and upon the mountains upon the corn upon the new wine upon oil upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon man and upon cattle and upon all the labor of hands I want you to notice one thing is they learn to live without the temple they learn without the presence of God and they were comfortable so that's what we want to speak foreign I'm the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated we're finding out that is I believe it's with a purpose I believe God wants us to see something important God wants us to see the conditions and how that's the same that would happen in the last days and many of us are found in the same condition but the biggest problem I see is that we're satisfied the way we are they would have continued foreign [Applause] your works are wonderful says the Bible and truly the human being in is the most adaptable creature that exists on the earth there are some animals that cannot live if their habitat is changed for example polar bears polar bears cannot live in a desert implemented weren't made to live there so the people are very worried today because they're saying we need to save them if the ice melts in Antarctica the polar bears will stop existing camels cannot live in the ice if you change their habit to their environment they begin to die drastic changes to their lives but with people but the human being is the man or the woman is so adaptable the hottest places on the planet is to live in that environment where people living in Antarctica people that live in the coldest places in the earth such a humid place like Houston but people live there people can live in a cold place there's people living everywhere in the planet because a human being was wonderfully made to be very adaptive the changes that happen in their lives in the Philippine mountains Vietnam people in the in Vietnam there are people that are living in swamps with mud all the way to their knees and that's where they live they live there's people living of transportation is swimming or through a boat yeah you've even and that's where they live adapter there's people that adapt to the environment there's people that say s if I lose my beloved I don't know how I can live without them I won't be able to live without them there's people that lose their children lose their wife their husbands I don't know what's going to happen well that happens all the time and the human being attacked and the human being learns to live without that that was so important they simply adapt please keep living on and there's people that says how will I live if I lose my sights people learn to live without eyes from an accident and they simply adapt I was reading about this woman okay they didn't have legs or or hands it was just her torso with a head is shopping mall uh buying things how did she get accredited she had like a lever on her face to the sides and she was looking in the store what she could buy for Christmas how adaptable our woman right doesn't matter what they lose they're going shopping all right but the human being is so adaptable they learn to live under the conditions they're in um from a bird and see how long they live they won't be able to survive they'll die quickly for human beings it's almost changing everything or changing anything and their life can continue their lives continue but I believe the greatest tragedy of all humankind is Nosotros is when the human being learns to live without God there's no greater tragedy than this thing songs that say I can't live without you foreign [Applause] I imagine Eve told Adam what are we gonna do Adam let's learn to live without him he says that they fled from God's presence they were planning aprender Vivir sin dios to learn to live without God Adam and Eve Kain Kane when God punished him God says in other words My Punishment is too great I cannot bear it that's what it says I can't support this is behold thou has driven me out of the day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth you throw me out of your presence I can't live with him unless he learn how to live well without him I look at Esau the Bible says in Hebrews 12 16 foreign for you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he started carefully with tears meditate on this he ran to his father I told him is there not one bless Genesis 33 is a chapter before when Jacob fought because Jacob was so fearful that he would face once again his brother is he stole his Birthright his Blessing is and after that happens for the first time again he's about to meet and he thinks Esau is going to kill him foreign raised in the sight of my Lord now watch Easton verse 9. I have enough my brother keep that that thou Hast unto thyself in other words I've learned and I'm happy without the blessing with from God now just watch brother Jacob was handmaidens and services it and Esau says I'm well I don't need it I have enough just like contento I'm happy now this same condition is the condition that the church in the last days would be in the Bible does revelation 3 this is later says that has Jesus outside of the church and they are satisfied and the message door to the heart this is did you know we got the Christian church has its greatest buildings it's ever had you know it's richer than it ever was you know that they got the best theologians they ever had is reaching towards heaven with half a million dollar pipe organs it's it's robed choirsos it's Scholars polished stuff from the Seminary to the very latest dots Los Cuates who can walk through the platform and not make one grammatic mistake who can limit their sermons to so much time with so much psychology that can hold up people's minds to the thought that they've got is noodles I don't know it is his best condition my mind has learned to live without God bless you Miss March itself have learned to live without Christ and preachers and Christ is outside of the door is the door of their own church and they say we are fine this is the same condition the church was the Bible says also in the latest days time shall come second Timothy three verse one thank you they says for men shall be lovers of their own selves don't put it out there amongst us for the shall be lovers of their own songs of those that are good verse 5 having a form of godliness yesterday's will be in Matthew 24. he said verse 37. [Applause] for us notice what the sign of the enzyme would be we've accepted Church nevertheless for ourselves lovers of ourselves God we're well foreign God is not there with them we've learned religious by routine at some point we cry for the holy ghosts but now and they said we've forgotten about him we've forgotten many times but at the moment when we desire God to give us the fullness of his holy spirit speaks of that man that's that Lord when he was angry with his ass and he said Lord you don't give me the holy ghosts have we every cried to God in that way Lord you know but you know what happens time passes and we learn to live without it we learned to live without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to guide ourselves a we learned to live without the guidance of the Holy Ghost the problem with learning to live without him is that one day we will die without him and that's where we'll worry the Bible says as it was in the time of nowhere and the people ran came and went they focused on their own lives they forgot about God hasta until he says it says until until the flood came then they remembered about God I was reading about this woman okay they knew you were in church because then two three feet deep of snow she didn't have a job she didn't have a lot of money she had very little to eat and says she was always early in the service and she was saying I cannot live without God go higher to the point where she didn't go to church anymore and the pastor went because he was dying of cancer and he said I expected to see her how I knew her how she loved God a person so devoted for years for years sacrificed everything for God she got so far from God it makes us think we don't need him he replaces God's things with other things that we don't need God anymore she was afraid to die without God people learn to live without god without God we learn to live without him tell it you know one time God took everything from jobos his children and he learned to live without them his children his cattle his money his health and job learned to live without all of that I cannot live without him without his presence [Applause] told them what are you doing I believe it's the same in our time it's been God's grace it can still be done amazing this element Brandon brother Branham says the message why I'm against organized religion say notice is this is the angel of Light remember the last time it's the Angel and the child that's the age we live in brothers that is the very next chapter is a 19. which is the coming bride yes and this is the last angel that came to bring life before the coming of the Bride call me Christ it was the loudest sea in church age then outside that we have of Christ on the outside knocking trying to get in the only church age how to do everything without God guiding Our Lives for them this trip we made to Israel we found out much that Temple matters to the Jews you can't do the sacrifices if it's not active they believe so much and that temple in that place that's where Adam was [Applause] that's where Abraham Casio fresia Isaac in sacrifice for the first Adam worship God as close as possible to that place and cry to God for God to restore that Temple it means so much to them and I can imagine that how much they dream foreign back then fundamental and simply see a foundation without God should kind of Glory with them they surely continue reading about Moses but God's presence was missing the sacrifices weren't there foreign yes God's grace that reached these prophets and told them what are you doing why have you learned to live without it why are you thinking no it's Grace in our time [Applause] in your life [Music] why are we so calm foreign I heard a brother he said speaking on his last daughter he had come on he had her when her next youngest was 22 years old already and the older daughter was 22. so this was his baby she was the apple of his eye foreign she helped him in the ministry in church sing in church they prayed that was his baby he says that morning High School her mother prepared her backpack because she was in high school and he says that was the last day I ever saw her I haven't known what happened to her this is he says on in her bedroom there's a billboard did they say Jesus that says Jesus is all I have every night foreign he says I thought I couldn't live without her you said about yeah we're here what if I asked God one thing is to not allow me to learn to live without it I can bear anything else I can bear to live without my daughter Hallelujah everything I can lose everything I want his presence [Applause] oh Church many of us have replaced him thinking we can live without him we will realize everything that we needed in our lives behold I stand at the door Our Lives could be greater if he was truly in our lives musicians can come brethren La Iglesia the church the church has learned to live without God oh Lord have learned to live without the Holy Ghost but it's time to stand to stop because consider our ways to recognize our state and return to the Altar and say God and one occasion I cry for the holy ghost at some point I told you that I needed you what has happened with my life why aren't you guiding my life why is your presence absent not with me please stand I can look at things do what you must leave what you must you'll learn to live without it without the things of this world but do it for God without God's presence in your life don't let another day pass without the Holy Ghost being the greatest in your life to lose but don't let another day pass es without the holy ghost in your lives that would be the greatest tragedy of your life because if you learn to live without him you have to suffer without him you'll have to die without him oh Iglesia oh Church it should be a fire a pain in our hearts we've gotten used to [Music] as the Bible says about the light of CN age but he is here knocking calling Adam where are you doing you were not made to live without me I made you so that only through me you could have it all [Music] right let go of everything else look for me get three seconds we find ourselves in a sad condition sometimes What a Sad condition is a church found in [Music] What a Sad condition we find ourselves as a family as Christians pretending to be something and he isn't there don't let another day pass es don't live without God's blessings don't live without his presence oh Lord Jesus help us Lord please help this church father that is you perhaps we could live without a building without
