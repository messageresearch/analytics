enough [Music] for me [Music] God bless you my brothers are you happy Brothers to do a service to the Lord foreign and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword in donces then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I may not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to Beersheba which belonged to Judah and left his servant there yes but he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now oh Lord take away my life for I am not better than my father is and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise indeed is and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise indeed because the journey is too great and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights until he grabbed the Mount of god let's pray Brothers gracious Heavenly Father before your presence foreign and we'll continue with the topic an experience or under an experience under a junior Elijah had had a great Revival Hermanos he had a challenge there yes because I believe that God is he Vindicated that man he was uh wasn't mine foreign foreign Brothers as we read in the word of the Lord right again that she says although the gods do to me she just wanted to kill Elijah experience no other place amen my brother with the Lord Brothers Hermanos Brothers foreign many times when we come across for God to just take our lives I don't want to live this problem to disappeared let me tell you bro God isn't going to give you Allah God knows Elijah fell asleep here's the word Brothers many times why foreign in the message [Music] I believe that it was what is What is the encouragement because I'm still not done and that's how the Lord and why did he grab him because they would all come and eat the corners and he had him there for a long time that the winter time the prophecies when did there must be the Lord I'm excited oh Brothers God bless you [Applause] thank you Santos foreign it grows in that atmosphere amen and if verse 4 says like this Brothers but he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now O Lord take away my life for I am not better than my fathers and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat amen you may take your seats Brothers focus is on Elijah the prophet is diving into the word we know that Elijah was the prophet sent by God sent to preach to the people of Israel about repentance but also to bring the word of the Lord's judgments upon Israel because the people of Israel you see I've turned their backs on the Lord and they have broke the Covenant with the Lord this is due to the idolatry yes you know and one occasion in chapter 18 like our brothers preached last week Elijah eventually stands up and the 450 prophets and we see God manifesting in Mount Carmen and he kills all the false prophets you see but in first the Kings chapter 19 verse 2 we can see we see that Queen Jezebel um after hearing that Elijah had slained all the false prophets as he becomes angry and trains to kill Elijah and the Bible foreign I believe I believe scared discouraged and at some points Elijah was so discouraged to the point that the Bible says that he prayed to God that he would take his life and you know looking into the term or meaning desert in Greek or in Hebrews it means unhabited Place uh amen brothers and I believe that just like Elijah each and every one of us as Christians in this world we will all go through through our own spiritual deserts you see many times do we like to think that by having crushed in our lives we're having a close relationship we all have to deal with problems we won't have to worry about the problems foreign each and every one of us we will go through problems we will go through our spiritual desert s we will go through times of Despair at times where it will be dark and lonely you see but in those deserts you see God can do marvelous things as well foreign Sacramento but as soon as we leave service we lose that momentum Brothers we can't get anything from the service foreign [Applause] so that we could realize your true friend is there will be times where it feels like we are rejected and alone there will be times where the voices of our friends there will be times where it feels like everyone is against us oh but our God says do everything you can to build the kingdom of God you see we can't admit this sometimes but we need to go through that desert because it seems like the youth is relaxing foreign you see in that place money will become worthless foreign God doesn't want cowards when it came to a showdown so he thought he was the only one in the nation who was still living for God and the King was going to put him under a trial s and they persecuted him and that little painted up Queen by the name of Jessica Strange's life and when he came to The Showdown Elijah possessed the gates of his enemies back to God again amen when Elijah was under that juniper tree I believe that he was at a point where he was in despair he thought that he couldn't do it anymore because he prayed to God he prayed to God he would take his own life I believe that Elijah fell alone knowing that the king and queen were again you see I believe that for a moment Elijah looked at his circumstances that he was alone and sometimes the devil wants us to look at our circumstances from our true purpose we start losing brothers because God is this because the devil is distracting us with the things of this world you see I remember that our brother Kayla Perez who inside when I look around the church I see so many people Bound by chains chains of circumstances chains of problems of school the Escuela and the saddest part about it is that it's become normal to all of us to be bound by chains maybe tonight maybe tonight we are changed we're chained by the same routines of coming to church over and over and over you see but tonight God wants to break those chains we have to wake up and look in the mirror and say I am a child of God [Applause] I was blind I am one that believes the message you see Brothers we will have to suffer in this Christian works you see our brother Brandon said and I'm foreign Elijah thought he was alone you see but the angel of the Lord rise for the journey is too great for you tonight God wants to wake us up and say I'm not done with you yes I'm just getting started with you oh Brothers we lifted ourselves we limit ourselves because we look at our problems we look at our circumstances and what he says Elijah might have been alone but God pursued him in that desert and you know what you call that is the grace of God no matter where the problems are important no matter how distant we are always there but he won't stop until you bow and say you are the true Lord and the King of Kings stronger [Applause] una experience an experience in the Juniper how many have had an experience you haven't had an experience don't worry you know what's being spoken of this is the scripture says that Elijah went through the desert and that he sat under a juniper tree on a good Sunday from having a good service on a Sunday morning there's a park that exists we're gonna bring this down a little there's a park after a great victory that Elijah there was a uh he is taking it all in Domingo after a good song There is a good uh you know what I'm referring referring to Domingo after a good Sunday there's a Monday afternoon [Music] we run as cows and you begin to cry that's why sometimes I just watch myself [Music] thanks to God for that Juniper this is all God's people need to go to go it's a place he was so discouraged that he didn't know what to do where Elijah was under the Juniper very discouraging how many of us we don't even want to come to church some people foreign well the problem lies [Applause] the word discouraged negative thoughts about himself and your environment irritability and changes in Moon your Elijah was to die you know I'm going to touch on a few points here I'd like to take it from this perspective why did Elijah run porque why was it because Jezebel threatened him in First Kings 19 10. and he said I have been very zealous for the Lord of God of hosts for the children of those who have forsaken thy Covenant look what Elijah's telling God here for the people of Israel to believe that's good Brother come on Miracles amongst us and the people won't believe [Applause] [Music] I'm happy for that Brothers I'm happy because of that because I was able to see it I can see it sometimes our expectations they're not the ones that we just we'd like I don't know if you can identify it this evening sometimes you look at your life and it's not what you'd like it to be and that's how Elijah his expectations that is what it's telling us here when he was in the cave it was the opposite my mind sometimes we've been years in church and our expectations there's no we're not trying to get better there's no growth [Music] expectations aren't met my mind or sometimes as a couple we get married and time goes by yeah and your expectations aren't what you thought they were doing if your husband isn't that many times your expectations and that's how Elijah was he thought I'm on good we can speak a lot on there this is in verse 2 it says then Jezebel said a messenger unto Elijah yeah sometimes we feel uh discouraged when we allow the devil to come and sow thoughts in our minds because Jezebel simply told him that's right all right brother I might yeah sometimes we allow the devs simply because he threats and he has no rights so come and put a sickness God doesn't allow him he has no right that always allows things [Music] true that's why sometimes we're discouraged we allow the devil to play with us for them to go down and then they're manifested another point I'd like to make or I liked sincere man I'm trying to bring it simply Brothers to see you simply another point I see here is wounds Elijah was wounded he was wounded yes he was because he thought que foreign yeah and those same people we're trying to look for him to kill him let's speak a little bit more here the Lord calls us to work in in the vineyard of the Lord in his work and the people come much they hurt do you not think that our pastor has been hurt many times you think that he has never been in a juniper he is a man he is a man and there are times that people are going to come to do something for the for the work of the lord and there are times when people even make faces and they make faces you're not in the right place that are wounded and shoots it at you hmm they shoot a dart at you no you don't want to do anything be sitting there on the bed because you're wounded you're wounded and that's how Elijah was he was wounded [Music] but I don't want to get to them I want to get to the glory of the Lord put marks on my body with marks on my soul of what I fought for what good is it to get there as a coward [Music] I wanna go I want to leave everything on the table although they heard us they hurt us badly sometimes people come without mercies they don't have any Mercy thanks be to God for a juniper now what should we do when we find ourselves where we're all wounded where we don't know where to go dios God Elias told Elijah bete go to Mount Horeb ird you know where Mount Arab is it is the Mountain of God he tells them go to the origins go to the beginning when we start in the way of the Lord foreign piano even then I fulfilled myself because I know what I can do when you know what you call it doesn't matter what they do for you you know what you were born for glory to God that's good amen and he runs to his word come forward foreign 1912 says that there came an earthquake and that he was there he wasn't there there came an earthquake and he wasn't there Pino Fuego fire came in and he wasn't there but then it says that there came a tiny a small gentlemen brother sometimes that's what Elijah thought that he was alone the God was working in silence God doesn't need a whole message a gentle and delicate Breeze it says [Music] yeah we're a small voice my mind why don't you just stand again I don't know who this message was foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] after that came Elijah children [Music] [Music] that's just okay don't ever allow for the devil to discourage remember always your father Lord [Music] because you provided for us Lord [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] when you're in silence [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] the name of the
