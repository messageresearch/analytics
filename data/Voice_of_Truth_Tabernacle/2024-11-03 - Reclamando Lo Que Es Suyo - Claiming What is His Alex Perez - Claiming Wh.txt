have your Bible with you greeting to our brothers watching us through the internet bless morning CN are watching us throughout the world this place this morning amen amen 5 verse have it with an amen we can begin to read amen the Lord says in the following manner and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof we're going to pray as a group amen heavenly father in these moments my Lord I believe you've already spoken to me you given me the thought for this morning but I ask that in these moments all of us that are here and those that will be hearing this message able to enter into one same spirit because what good is it for me to speak words the people perhaps aren't capturing what I'm trying to so I just ask you help us to enter into one one same mind for the word to flow in a free way this morning I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen while you do it hallelujah hallelujah my theme this morning we've been speaking of the coming of the Lord and I think now for a couple months we've been focusing on we've been focusing on the resurrection it's a very extensive topic we don't know everything we don't understand it all but one thing we do know we want to be a part of that Resurrection something inside of us makes us cry out it makes us desire that Resurrection maybe we don't understand everything I say it for myself but something inside of me and it's crying out for that for that new body this morning I would like to focus under the topic or the [Applause] title claiming what is yours not yours but what is God's claiming what is God I would like to read once again in verse five if you can read it with me and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the one who is speaking with tells him Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah amen Brothers verse six and I beheld in other words Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah turns and sees he no longer sees the lion he doesn't see a lion what is it that he sees and in the midst of the thron of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders basically he's seeing many things here in this throne but what is the greater Focus here in this Vision it says that he was standing that he stood from being seated there was a land that was standing almost as though that that lamb was about to make a transition you stand it's because you're going to do something something's gonna happen change direction and when he stands he sees a lamb and that lamb stood as though it had been slain and the writer or the the writer he says that they had seven horns and seven eyes I like something that the Pastor said last week those seven horn one a horn has always typified a kingdom a government upon this government you see seven horns seven different governments these Powers he says he also seven eyes in other words that these Seven Kingdoms amongst the seven there are seven eyes he gives the interpretation to what is it he say there the seven of God sent throughout the Earth so then when we go back once again because when we review because this is Sunday school when John sees the land that seven horns find a picture but I couldn't find it Pastor I didn't want to put something that wasn't that I just leave it up to your imagination that God revealed that to you the lamb is standing he has seven horns and those horns have eyes are the seven Spirit go throughout the Earth are we okay so then this this lamb he's not alone this lamb you don't see him alone a group of included in this with this lamb apocalypsis go to Revelations 4 verse 5 are you happy to be here this morning how beautiful is the Bible the more that I read the Bible and the message I realize aligned with the Bible 45 says go ahead and out of the throne we're speaking just of that throne in the king in heaven there's a there's a throne okay there's not a lot of Thrones speaking of the same Throne proceed lightning and thunderings and voices so in that Throne there are voices there are thundering there lightning there are Thunders are we okay brothers and before the throne and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne of Fire there were seven lamps of burning fire the first thing I want you to notice is that these lamps there was fire burned by a fire can we be in agreement this morning we're going to go slow but follow me pleas I promise my best eat this morning the throne there was lightning from it thunder and voices amen amen and then it tells us that in that Throne there were also seven l lamps what does it continue to say which are the seven spirits of God we begin to uh conjoin or join speaks to us of seven spirits as the eyes of God and Ahab is also looked or John is see seven lamps here there the seven spirits of God as well what is it that brother brandham says and the vision of Patmos the if you can put the first picture once I'm done reading thank you now the pmos vision this is in the church ages book now examine this lampstand you will notice that it has a large bowl or res or Reservoir that Central to seven arms that come out of it are you with me brother Bram we're speaking we're reading that it's not seven lamps but it is just one lamp with seven arms did you notice that okay okay go ahead and the Seven arms come out of it this bowl is filled with olive oil which flows through seven Wicks which are placed which are placed in the seven arms it is the same oil that burns and makes a light at the end of the seven pipes or Canales or the can the canal they're channels this light never went out the priest just kept pouring oil into the bow go ahead and put that picture please the first one I tried to look for a photo that had the bowl there bot but I wasn't able to find one but what we're reading is that this lamp it has seven wigs and these wigs being lit filled by a bowl of oil that was there beneath which this fire comes was from one fire it was from One Bowl it is not seven different Messengers but it is God Seven mess The Fountain the center is Jesus Christ is the Fountain and there were seven connected there they were lighting that lamp are you with me our Pastor said last weekend 2000 years ago on the throne waiting that every one of his children his sons that he bought come to him God wants you to come that you come to him because he can't come you will not come out from that place place from that throne continues being seated he is waiting for you for me the Throne of Mercy there's still blood there chosen one here on the earth and he continues saying or fin until the last one has been redeemed and when his the the thing that he's buying has been finalized it's purchased Willam Bram says in the pmos vision brother or here in this book I should we know that the Seven Ages they were written in 65 amen it says how thrilling it is to think of those seven lands drawing life drawing life from somewhere don't have their own kind of Life they obtain life from somewhere else abstract abct the fire can't alive to be connected of life don't shine just to sh can't by your own connected Fountain of Life to the to the inexhaustible life then you'll be able to shine you can light your Wick there he's representing every messenger of the church their life is on fire the life is on fire with the fire of the Holy Spirit put that picture back please so every Wick is lit it represents now we're going to get a little bit what we just got in reading it was the light for that age okay okay those seven eyes the Revelation that that age needed so that it could shine getting ahead of myself you'll follow me this morning amen his wig your Wick he says it here in parenthesis his life do you realize how important it is for your life to be connected the seven Messengers found the Fountain of Life they were able to connect to that as a result they brought light you connect of fire that that that activates you will produce that that same fire I love this your life has been or their life has has been submerged months ago at the camp we spoke of these things do you remember the the five wise virgins and the five foolish okay okay they've been through that Wick he is they are abstracting that same Life of Christ it is the same Life of Christ and through that same he's giving light to the church so the messenger or the man of every age that God Rose able to submerge himself to that Fountain of Life or fire extract of that same light then to be a light to that same age is that is that true or am I wrong your amen will give a great punctuation to this word and the Oneness what does brother Ram say here says see it wasn't that God don't deal with a person in a group do you understand this because we have to understand but we cannot uh we can read and not understand what we're reading so he direct he didn't understand what he was reading understand he was reading understand what I'm reading this is not my own some to show me for my they had to point me in the right direction to be able to understand I don't want to preach I I'm overdue I'm overdue in an organization God doesn't work that way he doesn't deal that way but what does brother Bron continue to say he deals with you as an individual okay okay we're gonna see now where we're going to he deals with you as an individual God works every one of you amen can you say amen God being the great Eternal one of the world of redemption part of that for that seed have to look for that seed looking for he's looking for it until he finds it and God begins to deal directly with you individually we are baptized with the Holy Ghost forgive me baptized with the Holy Ghost individually are baptized the Holy Ghost comes directly to you and IES us where brother Alex I'm not speaking of a baptism in your I'm speaking of the that comes and is awaken and that he baptizes that seed he makes it individually you have you have that decision you have to accept have to accept it AC the decision is yours the decision is yours God seen us as before you were going to elect him that you were going to choose him that's why he chose you by your choice it wasn't just R to make a decision morning choose him let's continue but collectively he first deals with you individually and he baptizes you collectively we are baptized into the body the word collectively because I didn't understand it I said it in the beginning I don't understand it all the prophet for the behind this pit it seems brother says layer after layer after layer take away those layers do matter how stubborn you might be I'm not I'm not going to stray off the path because it's a it's a holy it's a holy walk collectively what does it mean to say well it's a body it's a group me that many members belong to can can you put the second photo up there the first age the second age they had their Messengers they had the people that stay raing saying it's this way it's this way they don't get lost it's this way were to from that that fire and make light in the in the age of Ephesus there was Paul Paul had his group those that were under Paul baptism of the Holy Spirit as individuals and just like that successively also collectively God doesn't see different groups here here but he sees one collectively we are part of that body individually you are born a Son of God do you mind standing a little bit tus tius born with the Holy Spirit don't stand just him I believe that dwells in him it also dwells in me it dwells in you as a group there is an order thank you Ro tius collec cely can't assume his responsibility can I wear special purpose the baptism of the Holy Spirit have that same Holy Spirit two or three there's not seven there you don't see seven up there don't see there but I see one I don't see seven up here see one individually we have our experiences we're born again but when you're born again then you are placed to a collective group that forms a part of the Bride how many believe that we're in the seventh age under seventh messenger this is a group yes or yes yes or no brother this is a group age is a group in this church we are one group here under this group here do you go past the authority of this don't say it's better that you not say anything never mind don't say nothing you shouldn't so over pastor Pastor in position as children of God both children of God born of one same father but as a group there's an order okay let's let's prove this by the Bible are you with me this morning okay let's go to first because I like to prove it through the Bible and the message 12 says verse 13 I feel religious this morning for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles W free and have made and have been all made to drink of what brothers into one Spirit how many spirits are there all baptized can we be in agreement Brothers you have the same ingredients that I have Pastor inside of him is also inside of you are we okay sometimes we think that he's human as well he can hurt you body as well he is also a member and if you hit that member you're going to hurt him careful let's be careful I tell myself I don't want to hurt God has placed in this church as the head as the one in charge let's continue for the body is not one member but what are you asleep Brothers but what but many we're speaking body now collectively speaking I believe the people that say I receive the Holy Spirit and I don't go to church or I stay at church and there I there I serve Christ there no need to join the body Christ collectively because you again you have to the body you have to join yourself to the body you are as a member God gave you doing great my brother thank you after so long and not preaching your throat doesn't last anymore glor glory to God hallelujah roar roar Hallelujah also a lion say glory to God I also have [Applause] life okay okay if the foot were to say why am I not a hand we speaking of the collective body of Jesus Christ I think we've already clear reviewed or broken down that we have the Holy Spirit we're born under the same Holy Spirit in the collective body some are hands some are feet amen amen Brothers he's shown us the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Paul was the feet right head has to come up morning your it's your eyes or do you open anything else you might be weird you open your eyes I don't know there because I don't to every person to e their own but the brother told us wake up are your eyes we spoke of how the eyes they are the seven spirit spirits of Elijah of God of God I'm going to leave it there those that understand will understand so I can't Church body because there's an order I don't want to go past something of what I am I am if I'm a hand I can't try to be foot here speaking here in this environment someone here is the head be the God keep that day from passing place locally speaking there's an order yes right in the collective Body of Christ what does it form it forms a body a group I don't hear lot I sleeping or what or if my time's up already okay okay read chapter 12 here at your home when you have time 18 says like like this I'm going to be turning a corner here but now hath God who God not I not the pastor not you but God what does he continue to say the members every one of them in the body as it ha pleased him who has the the dominance or who the who is it that where remember was going to be it was God he is Sovereign I have no business here God that [Applause] them amen my duty is just to say Amen did you Capt were you able to capture God chooses he orain of the world going to be part of the body you were going to be it's Bible forgive me Brothers I get excited and when I get excited I I say some I tell you beforehand okay now so what does he mean to say that under one Same Spirit are we all baptized but under the collective body of body God has a bride and you are a part of that bride you have a portion of that Holy Spirit when born again God gives you a piece of inside of your interior and brother Bram that when you go to the oce you get a little spon it's just one little but all of the same ingredi are in that same spoon so don't make yourself less you're a fo or hand or a fe still have that same [Applause] power El power it is in you when you are placed purpose that God have that [Applause] power do you understand that are you able so a part of that because we're one body a collective body I form a you form a part of that brother Bram says this I like what the prophet says so just as my finger that is here for a purpose say my finger serves a purpose my finger has a purpose and every part of our bodies is to serve a purpose a little a little 12 returning back to that script it tells us that apost he says that there Ephesians 4 says says it there as well so each each member has its place but if you're a finger look at what brother Bram [Music] says how important or ins you might be we feel so [Music] insignificant right you know I'm not worth anything I don't deserve to be in this body brother Branham says does matter how insignificant you might be you are still a part of that body and the same power that is in the head is in the hands is also in the fingernail you have that power Brothers part of a collective group each person in their order to and to go live there you have that power brother Bram says it I'm finishing here my nail and my finger is a part of a [Music] purpose if you're a part of that body or member of that body serve a purpose that you have to fulfill have and be a part of that body seven light seven candlesticks Collective body one group that has the power to come out of this Earth the resurrection it's in you the victory inside of you to to cry out because the our are children of God has to be a grown inside there has to be a desire be a part of that body because our spirit is groaning what is it that is groaning for for that Spirit seed of life that it says that something tells you that you're not a part of this civilization of this [Music] government so worried orala Cala I'm not of this government government is in [Applause] heaven part of another government be a part of another member and underneath of that that government there's Li there's Freedom do you know that in that government there yes are people a citizen of the United States don't take it the wrong [Music] way but that thing is very simple so what I want to be a part of the king I want to be a part of that government belong to that government government gives me PR know the victory is yours it belongs to yous depression part of that government the victory is [Applause] yours are more than conqueror overc the lion overcame that's right because and when you enter the last one ENT the lion will Roar it means to say that youcame yes yes I'm waiting for that Roar brother the tit that's
