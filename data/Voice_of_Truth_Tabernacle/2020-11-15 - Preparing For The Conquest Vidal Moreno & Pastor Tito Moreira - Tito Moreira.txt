[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] grand grand [Music] [Applause] [Music] for [Music] God bless you this morning how many are happy to be in the house of God Amen God is good Brothers Amen Let Us open our Bibles this morning to the Book of Joshua chapter 5 um we'll be starting on verse 13 um and it reads in this manner and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what sayth my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so let us bow our heads to pray Heavenly Father father we're so grateful this morning Lord because you are so good and so kind to us Lord we ask that you just visit us this morning Father you just anoint the lips that will be speaking Lord and those that will be hearing as well father and we just be prepared to receive of your of your goodness and of your blessings Lord and at the end of the service may your name be glorified father we ask this all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen am you may be seated for a title this morning uh we I titled it uh we we titled it preparing for the conquest for the conest and and uh you know as just for a thought um we we just we just uh it was just submission um and and you know uh I just hope that you know that we just come prepared this morning you know there's a lot of times you know in in our lives and we we we've all come to church you know and you know the Bible says we're more than conqu through Christ Jesus you know I believe that with all of my heart but before we can conquer there has to be a preparation you know in all of Joshua chapter 5 was about preparation he was preparing the people you know all of it if you see they they had to get they circumcised themselves and you know and then they had the Feast of the Passover you know and and they were it was just preparation you know because God loves when you prepare you know and when you are prepared for for to conquer know that's when God begins to do things but it all has to do with the preparation my question this morning to you how did we prepare for this morning service oh you know how did we prepare last night because brother brandom says that we should be be preparing the night before service what did you stay up late doing you see that's between you and God because when you prepare you better believe that God is going to help you conquer you and that's where many of our failures come you know we fail to win the battle because we fail to prepare you see God does not want you to fail I don't have a God that has lost a battle lose battles lost a battle and his children don't have to lose battles either amen amen and as we continue uh we see that that Joshua being a leader you know he had a lot on his plate you know he had to lead many of people in his time it wasn't just you know 10 or 20 100 200 you know but it was millions of people that were following this man and I believe that Joshua was a very special man and he was a very prepared man for the job God had been preparing him since the beginning but you know as Leaders many times you know you have to make decisions that that don't just affect you but they affect the people that you are leading you know so and leading that many people being being that type of leader I believe that it becomes a very lonely place because you know you just can't you just can't go by what the people are telling you you know a leader has a lot of people around him you know and and they're they're trying to you know they're they sometimes they don't they don't mean to do wrong you know they they're just like maybe you should do this or maybe you should do that you know but a lot of times what what they're what they're saying is they're being led by their feelings you know and I believe that you know it's no different today you know we sometimes we just we're just led by our feelings you know and Joshua had to be very careful those things you know because although the people were preparing you see Joshua was a little uneasy about things he he was just he was just a little bit uncomfortable you know about the situation cuz I'm sure the people there was some of some of the people that were around him they were like Joshua right now is the best time we were circumcised now the Feast of the Passover let's do it right now let's just go and take over you heard the Lord he said it was ours Jero was ours to take you see but Joshua kind had to step back and analyze the situation because his decision he decided to go by what the people [Applause] said there were many lives at stake it wasn't just his own but it was millions of people so he was waiting was seeking counsel from God and we find in the Scripture it says that Joshua is by Jero other words you know he saw the Great Walls from from a distance and he just maybe just sit there meditating on God seeking his counsel it's like Lord you know there's something not right about the situation I need you to guide me I need you to steer me and and let me know when I should go so he begins to reflect he begins to remember the first battle and how it went down and you know when we when we talk about the first battle he starts thinking about his leader and that was Moses because Joshua was under Moses for a long time he was learning from Moses and you know Moses told Joshua in Exodus chapter 17 he pick you pick you some men pick some men you know and you're going to go fight and you know he had to fight the amalekites that was the very first battle that he fought and you know Joshua you know he was a servant of God he was a servant before he was a leader he was a servant amen amen and we see that Joshua begins to fight that battle and and you know and and and he's just fighting away and and you know that battle that he fought you know Joshua did not win it by his own strength you see but he looks up to the side of the mountain he sees Moses up there he sees Aaron and er up there and and and then they were up there and they had their hands lifted up you see and when they had their hands lifted Israel began to win the battle you see and at that moment you see the the the Revelation came down to Joshua that the battle that Jericho would not be won if he went in his own strength you see there's a lot of time in our lives we fight many battles you see we're just like you know we get excited and there's nothing wrong with being excited but we just we just let the excitement overshadow you know over over God's will we get all pumped up and we're just ready to go do this take over I'm GNA tell you something you should slow down cowboy you know just slow down you ain't going to do anything because when you think you're going to do something on your own you're going to see how you're going to fail and that's what Joshua was doing he was waiting on God he was not depending on his [Music] strength on what he could do but he was waiting and you know he just like I have to do something else he had to submit he had to submit to God before he could take Jericho if we would just do that this morning we wouldn't we wouldn't be so defeated many times we wouldn't come to church and leave disappointed the way we do sometimes a lot of times we leave Church disappointed and you know the reason is is because you never prepared the minister can prepare as much as he wants to he cannot prepare for you he can't he he can't do everything for you he's going to do his part but you have to do yours if you want to leave with a blessing this morning prepare from the night I did not come I don't come to church to to leave disappointed I come so that God can give me a blessing I live here rejoicing here excited but we have to make sure that we are prepared we made room for God that we pushed all the things that are that we don't need out so that he can give us of what he has he victories for us this morning what do you need he's got it amen amen moving forward you know and and Moses you know or I mean Joshua you know as he reflects you know he just he just begins to think you know on on the goodness of God you know because because when you have to make great decisions you know you just you just begin to reflect on God's goodness you know those walls of Jer weren't a wall like this one right here those walls were massive you could see them from from miles away I believe they were so big and you know Joshua was human he's like God have you been so good have you kept your word us to this point and I believe you but I I need you to help me I need of your counsel you know because he he didn't want to lose we don't want to lose a battle I do not like to lose I'm not a loser you know and if somebody told you you're loser they're lying losers we're winners you see and that's why we're here because we want to be on the winning team winner I don't care what anybody tells me they tell you you're a loser out there God told me I'm a winner I'm to lose here to win to win the heavens I'm here to win a crown whatever God has for me I want to win it that you have to have a preparation you don't want to leave disappointed sir and Joshua when when he just finish finishes meditating all of a sudden someone appears before him and Joshua pulls out his sword who are you with you know what team are you on you know and he's like I'm the captain of the host that's who he was and that's who he still is he's not changed you know and what amazes me is that he he appeared to Moses in a burning bush you see but he no longer was burning that's not who he was anymore he was not the angel that rled Jacob anymore but he was a man he was the captain that was suited up he was suited up for battle not only that but he had his sword Dr he was ready to go and when Joshua saw him and he if he knew who he was he bowed before him he bowed before him that's right he bowed before him he submitted to God you see and this God is the one that Joshua was waiting for you see Joshua being a great leader he was he did not feel fit to go by himself he didn't feel ready something was missing he's like I need I need something else and he just surrendered he fell on his face saw the captain he fell before his face because God was there and God was going to lead them into the battle I believe this morning we have a God that we have a god that is suited up for battle sword is drawn fight he's not a leader he's not a captain that's going to send you to battle first no he he's ready he is sued up to lead you if you want to go by yourself go ahead you you'll fail I've done it many times in my life I have failed when I Tred to do things my own way you know there's a lot of times where we just we just think that we can do it all and we come back very disappointed we come back very discouraged because we have not we've not allowed God to lead us into battle simp that we haven't let go of the things that we need to let go of you see and that's what it takes to win the battle men and women of God willing to let go of of of of who they think they are just lift up your hands just like Moses was up there he just had his hands lifted up he just didn't want anything to get in the way Joshua felt insufficient know we are insufficient in ourselves that's we are and if you don't think so then like I said you go on ahead you will be very dis disappointed in the outcome you see and and God does not want that he does not want us to fail you see he he wants us to submit everything we have all of our time all of our strength everything that we are say Lord I'm not sufficient I'm not enough in myself I need you to lead me I need you to strengthen me the way has become difficult but I know we're more than Overcomers through Christ Jesus who leads us into battle fight for his people he wants to cut that Sin from your life and he tells Joshua he says loosen your sandal because you're on Holy Ground if we believe that this morning I don't care what where you're at at what stage of life you're in right now I can tell you right now now we are on Holy Ground we are on Holy Ground what brother says are sitting in Heavenly places Jes it doesn't matter if you're sitting right now you're on Holy Ground and he wants to lead you he wants to fight for you well we let him this morning that's my question God bless [Applause] you you sound with me Joshua 5:15 what a wonderful word word we've heard and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so if you knew you know that you are standing by God's grace a clap offering Jesus Christ if you know come on if you know because you do know because you [Applause] do that you [Applause] are and Glory this morning Lord if I am standing because you have me standing you may take your seat that's what God was telling when God tells Joshua take Thy Thy shoe from thy foot for the place where on thou standest is when God tells him this God is saying josua if you're stand [Applause] you're standing at this it's because I you where I have sonog if we're only God to do only by his that's why God says take thy shoe off from I want to tell you we cannot do anything without God better said I can go so far I can continue I can go on with my brother or my sister I can go on without my husband or my wife I can go on without my home I can on without my vehicle I can go even without my I can't go on without God's without God's without God's pres I God does not go with me I can make it without you I can make [Applause] it make it with I won't be able to make it if he is not with me take that Sho off thy foot Joshua you are standing because I am with you because my presence has gone with you and will continue with you when they they speak of the scripture and Jericho people many times say God will fight your battle and up to certain point it is true many times we make it seem like if we have nothing to do like if God is trusting on God and he's goingon to fight the battle that's not the scene we're seeing here actually Joshua had much responsibility from verse since verse eight of chapter one God promised to be with Joshua had certain responsibility and obligations God told them in verse eight this is your responsibility Joshua never this this book of the law shall depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe and do did josu did Joshua have something to Joshua have something God was not going to do he josua had a [Applause] responsibility that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written now tell me if Joshua didn't have anything to do when God just gave gave him gave him a great responsibility to keep and do everything now let me tell you we have what the word says Joshua needs to do everything yes or yes brother may serve to do according to all that is for then thou shal make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success I want you to understand that Jericho's battle the Battle of Jericho they would not fight in on the with swords and Spear and arrow they would not fight physically on but they had to battle with for it would be an internal sometimes that's the greatest battle it's the internal battle for us to win what's happening outside conquer what's outside of heart is to conquer because in rebellious we're disobedient this is a trial the Battle of Jer was a battle of obedience of obedience God would test put to test his God tells Joshua Joshua you will go seven around once every [Applause] day day the entire people will surround Jero and on the seventh you will go seven around and then Thou shalt now for any person any person who has a natural reason who has a sane mind any s person would say that's foolish come on of us our natural mind we'd say that's foolish how that City while we go seven times around Jero it was something crazy any any man would have said I'll take my sword I will go myself and at least toss a couple Stones I want to slay a couple of them but God says you will only go around was testing their because that was foolish Bible says 1 Corinthians 1:18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto which are it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to where's the wise Des scbe the disp of this world have not God made foolish of the wisdom of for after that in the wisdom of the World by wisdom knew not God and pleased God by the foolish of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require and the Greeks seek but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews and unto theek but both Jews and the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolish of God wiser than men the weakness of stronger than men that's the God we serve Our God foolish to us the greatest wisdom the wisdom of God is greater the knowledge of this world and the weakness of God and the weakness of God hallelujah and the weakness of God is stronger than man that is our God why do we keep losing why do we not Prosper what the reason we can't conqu for our lack of Disobedience the reason we cannot conquer because we cannot surrend we cannot obey what God has told us because for our mind it seems for our mind it seems we have a better way but God has always done foolish things with a ass Jawbone Samson slay a thousand Philistines that's foolish you cannot do that but it was God's power it was The Obedience yes or yes brother God decided through an as's Jawbone to kill a thousand Philistines God decided to choose a young named Mary and through her through her he told Mary the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you and what you will will be the Messiah she did not although it was foolish she simply said Lord according to your I will fulfill was her faith she believed she believed something that was foolish who would have thought through foolishness of a crucified Christ Messiah bring Salvation for Humanity of that's foolish for God toic see him with no attraction to among decided to con hell all temptation foolishness we don't obey because it's foolish to us going to make parenthesis here it's hurt us greatly that the Lord took our sister Florencia and it's unfair for me to speak of the pain we feel knowing that her children and they are in a greater pain than we are but but I believe it hurts all of us it's hurt me a lot but I don't believe that it was a coincidence that the Lord took her I believe many lives have been changed and will change for what happened Lord took her for being disobedient I believe it was our sister's she was not doing anything she was not doing anything she was doing to be in her place of doing she was doing what she had to didn't take her from it was God's will but many of the things that have happened putting this aside that been said many of the things that have happened to are for Disobedience are for Disobedience because we've told you what you must do how you must do and we're not ashamed to go out step out of the church and do everything opposite you think God is not seeing that God sees our disob God sees how we disrespect say brother ttis it makes no sense you're overthinking you're overthinking I hear what you say but the one that will judge me for that will be our job is to Simply obey it might not make sense to us it might not make sense to us we might say what's that worth for leave that to God obey want to negotiate with God we want to tell him how we let me tell you when God do it how he told do not question it we've lost all the order all the structure and discipline there's no there's no obedience there's no fathers or parents it seems children are the parents please son please sonar I'll reward you with a cook please put it he doesn't want what happens is you don't want to be a parent shut up and wear it the parent you're not the parent teaching our children they can get away with what they want I'm the parent here and it will go it will go that's what God what God told people be [Applause] cursed it seems that our children are in are running the show we're the problem so we want our children do what they want later we see them cursed say you never taught them to obey the mother fixes I don't like this I don't like that this and the mother is doing what the children ask her we could see it here when we had a Sunday scho that I don't need it what has your children what have you taught your children have you taught them to do whatever they want if you want to eat there's the food and if you're not hungry that's fine I'm not going to cook again if you want food in your belly better put that food in your mouth or else I'm not giving you anything else that's our God says if you want my help you want me to be with there's no no we want to negotiate everything we want to negotiate with God like will when God tells you to do children they took fire they said take and they did their own fire sended his own fire and killed them because they disobeyed they said we can say he killed God it matter obedience matters to God obedience matters to God God told Joshua I'm going to tell you something foolish but first I need you to understand that without me you won't be able you are standing because I'm here you are standing because I'm with you you're still here because my Grace has been with you we can fight but we will not overcome without God we overcome God tells him I want you to that if you obey things that seem I have a purpose I have a purpose I know why I'm doing God told e eel lay for and don't move what did he do he laid for other side another year on for through the streets City us man like e God told I will take your wife I
