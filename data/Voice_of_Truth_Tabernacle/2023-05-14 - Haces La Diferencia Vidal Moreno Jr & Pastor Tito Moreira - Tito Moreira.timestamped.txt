[32:57] um
[33:18] and he said unto me my grace is

[33:32] for the girl that you've been with us
[33:37] Lord we ask that you make yourself
[33:40] present one more time
[33:45] you express yourself to your servants
[33:50] that you manifest yourself one more time
[33:52] through your word and at the end of the
[33:54] service
[33:55] all honor and glory be for you we give
[33:59] you thanks for everything we ask all
[34:01] these things
[34:04] amen amen
[34:07] you may be seated brother
[34:11] uh you make the difference yeah
[34:16] you know uh I was uh just kind of
[34:19] meditating a little bit
[34:21] and uh you know a lot of times what the
[34:25] mothers do
[34:27] they're not seeing noise
[34:31] they don't get a lot of credit
[34:34] you know for some of the things that are
[34:36] done
[34:37] you know and one of the stories
[34:41] you know it's actually a movie and
[34:44] uh it's it's uh it's the 300 Spartans
[34:50] uh and uh everybody knows those of you
[34:55] that have seen the movie
[34:57] you know the the main the main guys
[35:02] uh they're they're the 300 Spartans
[35:06] yeah but you know doing a little bit of
[35:08] of reading
[35:11] and and just looking into the history
[35:15] of of the 300 Spartans
[35:19] uh you know I I come to find out that
[35:23] uh when uh King Leonidas
[35:27] uh when he when he decides to choose the
[35:30] 300 Spartans
[35:34] there's actually more to uh the story
[35:36] and Sierra
[35:38] uh then uh just these guys that knew how
[35:41] to fight
[35:44] these these Men of War
[35:46] you know with big muscles
[35:49] you know they knew how to use the
[35:51] shields
[35:52] they knew how to use the the sword
[35:57] as well as the spears
[36:00] so it was more than just that to the
[36:02] choosing of the 300s
[36:09] foreignitas actually uh the reason he
[36:11] chose them
[36:14] was because of the mothers and the wives
[36:18] that they had
[36:22] that was the reason that the 300
[36:25] Spartans were chosen
[36:29] had nothing to do with the men's bravery
[36:35] although they had to have it
[36:38] it had nothing to do with their own
[36:40] strength
[36:44] but uh it was it was more
[36:47] about the character
[36:50] that they had developed
[36:52] through the women
[36:55] they were actually behind them
[36:57] amen amen and uh you know so that was
[37:01] that's they said that that's tradition
[37:04] that was a tradition that was said back
[37:07] then
[37:08] but when I read the story
[37:11] I was like man I believe that
[37:14] I believed it 100 percent
[37:18] because before I read the story
[37:20] I actually read what brother Branham
[37:23] says presuming
[37:46] he says in the fall of the nation it
[37:50] says as soon as a motherhood was broke
[37:52] and Womanhood that nation's backbone was
[37:55] broken the eldice
[38:03] and then and then there's another one
[38:06] that I like also
[38:09] and it's it it's it talks about the same
[38:12] thing
[38:13] but he says this is
[38:16] in the message the world is falling
[38:18] apart
[38:20] and that's the backbone of the nation
[38:23] yes
[38:26] it says you break motherhood
[38:30] says you broke it you broke the nation
[38:33] right then
[38:34] so that's one thing that hold that helps
[38:37] hold it together
[38:39] it's real genuine Parenthood
[38:45] you know when we talk about the 300.
[38:49] you know and and and what they did
[38:53] you see nobody talks about the women
[38:55] that were behind them
[38:58] nobody talks about the women and the
[39:00] mothers
[39:02] that actually helped raise these
[39:05] Warriors
[39:08] nobody talks about who fed these men
[39:12] because you can't go out to Wars
[39:15] if you're not well fed you said
[39:18] you see you gotta eat rice
[39:20] you gotta have the right you gotta have
[39:23] the right characters
[39:25] correct in order to go to a war
[39:29] you see but the greatest the greatest
[39:31] thing to me is
[39:34] that Leonidas
[39:37] when he when he was thinking about who
[39:39] was going to go with him
[39:43] he was thinking about the future
[39:47] he was thinking about the future of
[39:49] Greece
[39:53] that's what he was thinking
[39:57] so when you when you go back
[40:00] when you go back in and see that and he
[40:04] leaves these women
[40:05] and these wives and mothers
[40:09] you see a lot of it was entrusted in
[40:12] them
[40:16] and what they were all about
[40:20] so these women
[40:23] the man would not go
[40:26] unless the woman was behind the man
[40:30] unless the woman was behind the man
[40:34] the man was not gonna go to war
[40:37] because Leonidas understood
[40:40] he understood that if these women if
[40:45] they if these women lost their heads
[40:49] if they if they went into depression if
[40:53] they went into Despair
[40:55] and then the whole nation yes
[41:18] a seed was deposited foreign
[42:08] [Music]
[42:15] good I believe that
[42:18] I really enjoyed that story
[42:21] and you know when we talk about women
[42:24] not only women but mothers
[42:28] you know they don't they don't get a lot
[42:30] of credits
[42:31] [Music]
[42:32] they don't get matter of fact I don't
[42:34] think they get hardly
[42:36] anyone Recon you know the last name
[42:43] they take the husband's last name
[42:46] you see so they're willing to uh
[42:49] sacrifice
[42:51] you know even their their last name
[42:55] [Music]
[42:57] for a greater cause
[43:01] amen amen
[43:03] and there's just so much other things
[43:05] that they sacrifice
[43:08] you know there's you know there's the
[43:10] the children
[43:12] uh you know sometimes they're thirsty
[43:16] I've seen it you know a lot of times
[43:20] uh where you know the mother she's got
[43:22] her own she's got her own coke
[43:27] you know and then you got the little
[43:29] kids
[43:31] no they're eating crackers
[43:35] you know Takis Takis you know they're
[43:38] just eating there and you know they're
[43:39] all dirty yeah
[43:41] and they want a drink
[43:44] well the mom has the only drink
[43:48] hold me close to her
[43:51] and you know the kid comes
[43:56] and she sees his face
[43:58] full red stuff
[44:02] crackers on his face
[44:04] and she knows what's going to happen
[44:07] he wants a drink
[44:10] and uh you know she looks at him
[44:14] and she realizes that when she gives
[44:17] that drink away
[44:19] oh she's not gonna get it back the same
[44:23] there's gonna be all kinds of Little
[44:25] Fishies floating around
[44:30] that's what it is
[44:32] [Music]
[44:33] they're just gonna be floating around in
[44:35] her drinks
[44:38] and so you know the drink isn't the same
[44:40] anymore
[44:41] the mother sacrificed that
[44:45] because you know she loves her children
[44:48] those those are just some of the small
[44:51] things
[44:52] you know that the mother sacrificed
[44:55] for their children you know a lot of
[44:58] times you know the young man
[45:01] the teenagers uh
[45:13] [Music]
[45:24] you know there's a lot of times you know
[45:27] the mom's got she's got her stash
[45:54] la madre
[45:56] and mom goes over there when she wants a
[45:58] chocolate or something
[46:01] she no longer has the chocolate
[46:04] because the kids ate it
[46:07] you know it's just it's just some of
[46:09] those things
[46:11] you know that mothers you know are
[46:14] willing to sacrifice
[46:16] you know for the children
[46:18] you know not realizing
[46:21] you know that that it's small things
[46:24] like that
[46:26] it's it's sharing those things
[46:29] you know a lot of times giving it
[46:32] and getting nothing back in return
[46:36] that actually makes the difference
[46:38] it makes the difference
[46:45] you know he has this other quote
[46:47] and I really like it it's in the message
[46:51] my life story
[46:56] now a good woman is a jewel in a man's
[46:58] Crown
[47:01] she should be honored
[47:04] my mother's a woman
[47:06] my wife is and they're lovely yeah I've
[47:11] got thousands of Christian sisters who I
[47:13] highly respect
[47:16] if they can respect what God made them
[47:21] so I'm going to read that again but if
[47:24] they can respect what God made them
[47:28] a motherhood and a real queen
[47:32] that's all right she's one of the best
[47:35] things that God could give a man
[47:40] you see I I want to read that I'm going
[47:43] to read one more time
[47:45] but if they can respect what God made
[47:47] them
[47:50] you know when he says
[47:52] you know I I like what he says
[48:53] let's read it again I don't want to
[48:55] misquote it
[48:58] he says my grace is sufficient for thee
[50:00] how much
[50:58] I
[51:00] would look at
[51:01] you know I'd look at her in tears
[51:49] [Music]
[52:00] she can still
[52:12] enough way
[52:16] that was
[52:18] how could I put it come on up all the
[52:21] cedar that was the decision
[52:25] that was the easiest okay
[52:29] to leave
[52:31] to walk away the irsay
[52:35] and she stayed there
[52:37] I wonder how many women
[52:41] how many women of the of the wives of
[52:43] the Spartans
[52:47] didn't want to go out there and fight
[52:50] and you know they just a lot of times
[52:54] women man if they had the straight to
[52:55] men
[52:58] they'd make better Warriors
[53:37] tears
[53:47] [Applause]
[54:37] uh
[56:15] [Music]
[56:34] if you're crying for Joy it's different
[56:58] you know because something something
[57:01] strong
[57:02] something that's really strong
[57:05] it derives
[57:09] he
[57:26] he can't cry Meyer
[57:29] you cannot Cry by her hello
[57:34] you know
[57:36] but better he has to be strong for her
[57:41] you got to be strong for her
[57:43] that's why men are strong
[57:47] because it comes from a softer side
[57:52] always expect your husband to cry with
[57:54] you
[57:57] he's crying inside
[58:00] but he's trying to stay strong
[58:03] stay strong
[58:05] you know in God's the same way
[58:08] you know he came elvino he was willing
[58:11] to endure
[58:13] he stayed strong
[58:16] he stayed strong because he loves
[58:19] something so much
[58:21] he loves you so much that he was willing
[58:25] to endure yeah
[58:44] [Music]
[58:54] God bless you
[58:58] [Applause]
[59:05] happy Mother's Day to everyone may God
[59:09] bless you all
[59:12] um
[59:13] whether you be a mother or not I stand
[59:18] and also the men and we love you
[59:23] as your pastor I love you
[59:29] and always hope to be of service for you
[59:33] let's read first Samuel
[59:46] let's go over it one more time
[59:50] there's always new thing God shows us
[59:54] I want to tell the children
[1:00:01] the greatest gift you can give your
[1:00:03] parents is
[1:00:13] there's nothing that would make them
[1:00:15] happier
[1:00:18] there's nothing you can give them that
[1:00:20] would make them happier
[1:00:23] and for you to surrender to Christ
[1:00:26] and you surrender your heart to the Lord
[1:00:31] so if you're thinking about gifting your
[1:00:34] mother something
[1:00:36] why not say Lord help me so give you my
[1:00:40] heart
[1:00:43] and prove with my life
[1:00:46] what my mother taught me
[1:00:49] has made an effect on me
[1:00:53] that's the greatest thing a son can do
[1:00:55] furthermore
[1:01:14] now there was a certain man of Ramadan
[1:01:17] zofim of Mount Ephraim and his name was
[1:01:20] alkana the son of jeroham the son of
[1:01:22] elio the son of tohu the son observed
[1:01:25] and efferite
[1:01:27] foreign
[1:01:42] and he had two wives the name of the one
[1:01:45] was Hannah and the name of the other
[1:01:46] penina and penina had children but
[1:01:49] Hannah had no children
[1:01:59] just because the Bible reports the truth
[1:02:02] of the case
[1:02:04] does it mean it supports it is
[1:02:12] like a newspaper reporting homicide or
[1:02:16] anything
[1:02:19] does it mean that newspaper supports
[1:02:22] this Behavior are you with me
[1:02:26] so for you to see polygamy here doesn't
[1:02:29] mean the Bible is
[1:02:32] simply saying the truth of the case here
[1:02:34] this is
[1:02:48] and this man went up out of his City
[1:02:51] yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto
[1:02:54] the Lord of hosts in Shiloh and the two
[1:02:56] sons of Eli hoffney and Phineas the
[1:02:58] priests of the Lord were there
[1:03:11] and when the time that was was that
[1:03:14] alcana offered he gave to penina his
[1:03:17] wife
[1:03:18] ought to her sons and to and her
[1:03:20] daughters portions
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:29] he gave a worthy portion for he loved
[1:03:32] Hannah but the Lord had showed up her
[1:03:34] womb
[1:03:43] now there are medical terms when someone
[1:03:45] cannot have children
[1:03:48] and science calls them different names
[1:03:53] but at the end the one with the final
[1:03:55] decision is
[1:03:58] and we want to see that foreign
[1:04:22] is
[1:04:36] and her adversary also provoked her soar
[1:04:40] for to make her heart
[1:04:42] for to make her fret because the Lord
[1:04:45] had showed up her womb
[1:04:48] so it wasn't enough that she didn't have
[1:04:51] children
[1:04:57] they still try to irritate her on
[1:04:59] purpose
[1:05:08] and as he did so year by year when she
[1:05:10] went up to the house of the Lord so she
[1:05:12] provoked her therefore she wept and did
[1:05:14] not eat all right
[1:05:16] now verse 8 is a little funny
[1:05:22] por que no comes on
[1:05:35] and why it is thou not and why is thy
[1:05:38] heart grieved am not I better to thee
[1:05:40] than ten Sons
[1:05:43] what's funny is that Hannah didn't reply
[1:05:46] anything
[1:05:47] am I not better than 10 Sons
[1:05:56] am I not better than five those two
[1:06:02] centado
[1:06:24] sword
[1:06:39] is
[1:06:49] if that will indeed look on the
[1:06:51] Affliction of thine handmaid
[1:06:53] and remember me
[1:06:56] now forget that is
[1:07:13] no razor come upon his head
[1:07:22] first thing I want you to notice about
[1:07:24] Hannah important
[1:07:27] was how important it was for her to be a
[1:07:30] mother
[1:08:07] he was not better or good enough
[1:08:12] notice the importance
[1:08:24] I understand today
[1:08:29] is today
[1:09:29] maybe there was nothing wrong with her
[1:09:31] implement
[1:09:45] because God wanted to give her a greater
[1:09:48] blessing
[1:09:50] all she wanted was a son
[1:09:54] and God wanted to give her a prophet
[1:09:59] um
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:09] Kings of Israel
[1:10:13] first man
[1:10:18] King David
[1:10:20] all she wanted was a man-child
[1:10:24] she was not anyone important
[1:10:28] but God was holding the blessings
[1:10:32] and so she got to the point
[1:10:36] where she could vow this
[1:10:40] because when she got to the point
[1:10:46] everything changed
[1:10:52] I wanted to bring you thus far yeah
[1:10:58] God is holding back the blessing many
[1:11:00] times
[1:11:03] it doesn't mean God isn't hearing
[1:11:05] yourself
[1:11:10] especially from uh
[1:12:18] so take me to the point where I'm ready
[1:12:27] foreign
[1:13:14] give him unto the Lord all the days of
[1:13:16] his life
[1:13:18] and there shall no razor come upon his
[1:13:20] head
[1:13:24] now notice how much she was willing to
[1:13:27] sacrifice
[1:13:29] is
[1:13:31] willing to sacrifice her life her
[1:13:35] desires
[1:13:36] What She Likes
[1:13:42] many times we like to box in what we
[1:13:45] think a mother is
[1:13:48] certain way
[1:13:51] and if it's not that way
[1:13:53] then she's not a mother
[1:13:58] but I want to expand your way of things
[1:14:05] because many times we think of mothers
[1:14:07] is
[1:14:10] she that is protecting her children day
[1:14:12] and night
[1:14:14] and doesn't let anything bad happen to
[1:14:16] them but Hannah
[1:14:21] gave him
[1:14:23] God
[1:15:33] so what we think about a mother
[1:15:36] I will let this say the Bible says in
[1:15:39] primate first Timothy 2 15.
[1:15:43] if you read verses
[1:15:47] says a woman who's not called to preach
[1:15:53] the woman is not called to minister or
[1:15:55] be a pastor
[1:15:57] but then she receives her colleagues
[1:16:07] but then God gives her it is
[1:16:22] Holiness with sobriety
[1:16:26] God gives a woman
[1:16:33] a woman can have is Mother no
[1:17:06] [Music]
[1:17:11] usted
[1:17:12] again
[1:17:16] you can stretch it more than someone
[1:17:19] that has had a child okay
[1:17:21] mujeres because there are women
[1:17:24] that have never had a child
[1:17:28] but our mothers for others
[1:17:32] I repeat it again
[1:17:34] there are women
[1:17:36] that have never had children
[1:17:40] but have been a mother
[1:17:42] for many
[1:17:47] think about that for a moment
[1:17:50] mujeres
[1:18:01] one more time
[1:18:04] this should help the women
[1:18:10] then how will I be saved
[1:18:13] if I've never had children
[1:18:17] if I've never had a child
[1:18:20] because the Bible says women shall be
[1:18:23] saved
[1:18:24] God gave the woman
[1:18:28] this is
[1:18:38] they have the gift of raising
[1:18:43] she has the gifts
[1:18:50] because God gave man certain gifts
[1:18:56] and people say well it's not fair
[1:19:00] the woman wants to be like the man
[1:19:03] who will be a mother
[1:19:07] if the woman takes a man's place
[1:19:23] that brings the backbone of our church
[1:19:26] of a Nation
[1:19:28] you know a pastor's job
[1:19:31] would it be lighter
[1:19:45] is that okay
[1:19:48] there will be a little bit of everything
[1:19:50] this morning
[1:19:53] the pastor's job
[1:19:56] will be much lighter porque
[1:19:59] I query
[1:20:01] because how difficult it is with the
[1:20:04] youth right
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:55] look mothers
[1:20:58] Siempre
[1:21:00] you don't have to like it all the time
[1:21:03] it's okay
[1:21:06] I sometimes don't like the calling God
[1:21:08] gave me
[1:21:10] but I understand
[1:21:32] I gave you the gift of motherhood
[1:21:39] it's up to you to
[1:21:41] um develop it
[1:21:43] as a pastor
[1:21:45] let me tell you when I began
[1:21:48] I am nothing like what I am
[1:21:55] Services 10 15 years ago
[1:21:58] I look at myself and I'm embarrassed
[1:22:02] I'll say oh Lord how I
[1:22:06] stuttered
[1:22:10] because you don't start knowing
[1:22:12] everything
[1:22:14] thanks to God I didn't give up
[1:23:08] I believe God is
[1:23:12] I would have given up a long time ago
[1:23:19] principles
[1:23:37] that's how it is
[1:23:49] oh God
[1:23:52] will help a Perfection
[1:23:59] I need to finish
[1:24:14] before the Lord that Eli marked her
[1:24:17] mouth
[1:24:21] only her lips move
[1:24:24] but her voice was not heard
[1:24:28] therefore Eli thought she had been
[1:24:30] drunken and today is
[1:25:32] it's simply a fact
[1:25:37] and men are the ones that complain the
[1:25:38] most
[1:25:50] I believe that's why God is more present
[1:25:53] so the sisters of women
[1:25:56] because they need that right more than
[1:26:00] men do yes
[1:26:06] decisions and we still criticize them
[1:26:15] foreign answered and said no my Lord I'm
[1:26:18] a woman of a sorrowful spirit
[1:26:24] it's my spirit that needs rest
[1:26:26] how many sisters
[1:26:44] have poured out my soul before the Lord
[1:26:58] for out of the abundance of my complaint
[1:27:01] and grief have I spoken hither too
[1:27:05] damn pass go in peace
[1:27:11] granted thy petition now has asked of
[1:27:13] him and she says
[1:27:25] I want you to notice this final
[1:27:27] description the musicians can come yeah
[1:27:30] and
[1:27:31] and did eat and yet
[1:27:40] so the woman went her way Angelina and
[1:27:43] her accountants was no more sad notice
[1:27:47] and the last part is
[1:27:52] and her countenance was no more sense
[1:27:55] and her countenance was
[1:27:59] God had not answered yesterday God had
[1:28:02] not given us
[1:28:05] God hadn't given her any confirmation
[1:28:07] yet
[1:28:10] but she received her rest in God
[1:28:16] she received what she needed
[1:28:19] the day she went to church
[1:28:25] [Music]
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:38] and left a different woman
[1:28:42] God didn't promise for anything
[1:28:46] Spirit was different
[1:28:51] and her countenance was no more sad
[1:28:56] how many believe God can do that for us
[1:29:07] I
[1:29:11] believe if there's praying Warriors it's
[1:29:13] the women
[1:29:15] foreign
[1:29:27] I doubt there's many men that pray like
[1:29:30] the woman
[1:29:33] and they pray because they're they have
[1:29:36] need
[1:29:37] Ed
[1:29:39] they have much more stress than men
[1:29:44] not only are they mothers sometimes but
[1:29:46] they are they're also providers for
[1:29:48] their home
[1:29:52] sometimes we're giving them double work
[1:29:55] yeah this is
[1:30:00] and sometimes they're the only provider
[1:30:03] that home has
[1:30:06] even more work now

[2:03:29] and we simply want to recognize that
[2:03:32] this is
[2:03:39] my grandmother Lois and I mother Eunice
[2:03:43] and I am persuaded that in thee also
[2:03:45] okay
[2:04:06] thou stir up the gift of God which is in
[2:04:09] thee by putting on of my hands
[2:04:22] I'm a person that sees the scripture in
[2:04:25] different angles
[2:04:26] but the way I take it is
[2:04:34] gave Timothy the gifts but the pudding
[2:04:39] on of hands
[2:04:42] maybe help stir the gift of God
[2:04:48] not at the pudding of hands gave him the
[2:04:51] gifts
[2:04:54] putting of hands help him stir up the
[2:04:57] fire
[2:04:58] and that's what we want to do
[2:05:02] no man gives kids
[2:05:04] all gifts come from God says
[2:05:13] law but I believe when we recognize it
[2:05:16] or this man okay so Aviv that is
[2:05:30] and take a higher responsibility
[2:05:34] working for the kingdom of God
[2:05:42] all that
[2:05:45] will count is what we did for God
