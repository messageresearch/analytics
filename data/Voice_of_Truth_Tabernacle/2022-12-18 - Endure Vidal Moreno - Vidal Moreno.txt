[Music] following song foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I say I go [Applause] [Music] crazy [Music] wait [Music] um foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and my girls [Music] God bless you brother almost uh we're going to open our Bibles they're in Hebrews chapter 10. we'll be reading from verse 35 and on how many are happy it's a um it's an end of the year thoughts as a title um God has led me so title it endurance amen amen let's read the Scripture it says like this he said cast not a waiter for your confidence which had great recompense of rewards for you have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye might receive the promise now the judge shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul um if you can follow me to Philippians 1 6. this is being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ let us bow our heads and we'll be praying Heavenly fathers we are highly grateful with you for the privilege that we have to come to your house hear your precious word is had a great impact in each of Our Lives is something that has held us up yes that has allowed us to last Lord yes it's something that is very special for us Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated go to English um as I said for a title I want to title it endure located amen amen I think it's a very uh important characteristic of a Christian Persona characteristics to be able to endure the word of God tells us that we must endure it's it's one of the characteristics that uh that should stand out in uh somebody that professions professes to be a Christiana they they should be able to look at you and uh that you're a Christian Cristiano by the way that you endure you said amen amen by the way you behave in certainly and I just want to read a definition and it says in the following manner it is to be able to withstand a process or a situation that is unpleasant or and and difficult uh to give up it's the the other one is amen as we look as uh aguanta that's what enduring means and um you know as the end of your thoughts when we think of endurance it's something that all Christians should should have you know and we can profess to be a Christian Cristiano all we want to but you know at the end of the day it's uh the people that endure Sonos personas are the ones that obtain the price amen amen you know I don't think God called us uh you know because uh we were weak porque Ramos Devils amen amen I think that you may uh thought yourself as weak devil but God knew that you were strong you know I I the book of Isaiah chapter 53.3 yes it says it says this this I see it says therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoils with the strong partes so he thinks highly of him he thinks uh you know he thinks they they that you're strong you say well I feel weak but he's strong you see a lot of times you know you think you're weak because somebody told you or because you may feel me but he said you were strong you see and then we don't go by feelings here yeah we go by faith and if you have faith in God's words and he tells you you're strong you know the the song says let the week say I am a man you know brother Branham says this he says moving forward he says uh it's in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says if you can only see that it's God's will to do these things for you it's God's will to save you all is God's will to heal you and he will certainly lead you into deeper depths and higher Heights if you'll just trust yourself it says don't be satisfied with your fire built here from last night he says let's build a little further up the road tonight this has never build it in the same place [Music] you know God has brought us this foreign and we think we made it foreign foreign wow he's like now I'm going to show you what what works does without faith and he started moving yours he started doing circles the other way he was in the same place which I believe faith is the father of words siento we are in a race Carrera and we want to win we want to obtain the prize you know and that's just the thing yes you see in in my line of work you know one of the greatest um one of the greatest mistakes people make is that when they're about to uh retire oh you know they are they stop they they begin to become careless important they just they're there they don't they don't watch out as much as they used to no secret you know and uh you know as as the year you know as the year ends as our Christian journey is is moving forward that's one of the things we have to watch out we have to uh we have to be careful as I began the the life of alignments I'm going to be honest with you I was scared I I was looking around not that everything was gonna kill me but you know it was the truth and as I began you know in my in my career I realized they did not everything was going to kill me and uh but you know when you get up there you'll be real careful when you're working on the hotlines exactly where you are you know and what the goal is you know what you have to accomplish you see uh because I I wanna I wanna last I want to be able to endure you see and and you know it wasn't it was you know I wonder if the Christian people haven't been mistreated I just I just want to let you know you may say I'm a Christian who said Cristiano and I haven't been mistreated well maybe you're you're you're hiding something maybe you're not even professing that you're a Christian Professor then you would get mistreated you see that make fun of you mock you said you may Professor but just because you professor professor does not mean that you possessed as soon as you Professor it's life-changing they're gonna they're gonna have to see what you're made of stuff and if it's only a profession it's not gonna last very long because you have to have the power to be able to help you see I see a lot there's a lot of Christian people they say they're Christians and as soon as soon as you make fun of them short-lived that's right it proved that he wasn't what he said yes and that's weak yes you see what he didn't call us [Applause] you know the funny thing is that's only the beginning that's just the beginning he's talking about horses here but long distance ones he says but oh how beautiful is a thoroughbred they don't go into any denominational arguments that is he's not looking at the United States [Applause] we start looking I'm keeping our eyes off of Jesus we start looking at the problems I'm not gonna go to church because the brother just said this about it is everybody has yeah they don't have Jesus that's right you may have problems everybody has problems that's right yes you see and we were very fortunate to be able to have him throughout our problems you know and with some of those synonyms of enduring amen amen Ephesians chapter six affects your says uh verse 13. it says they're this he says see it says word for take unto you the whole armor of God that you may able to be able to withstand in the evil days in having done all yeah uh two stands you see we gotta stand that time and not just do some no just to not do something but it says having done all but all things in order to stand but I start feeding this amen amen I just want to read a you know because this is this is a long journey you know and it's it's only for the strong yes that's that's the truth you know where we are we are not no somos called here we're not cooler horses that's right we're not us yes but that's not me by the blood of Jesus that's right that's what he calls and when you prefer Professor to be a Christian professor said Cristiano you better be ready to prove it I believe that we got Warriors here we got people personas they don't want to be handed the rewards that's right you know I don't know about you no say this they'll stand and I've said it I've said it I'll say it again that's something that that's given to you I'll go okay [Music] I wonder how good this is you get sick always uh you know but but the thing of it is what we have here look at the name this is six star esto is six stars there's nothing there is matter of fact I would say it's seven stars who gave us the seven messages if you take foreign Corazon Galatians 6 9. it says this is and let us not be weary in well doing for a due season we shall reap if we faint not no NOS cancer you know and that's that's something that I think we've all felt yes you know you felt the pressure you felt the pressure of uh maybe a new job or maybe a renewed walk with the Lord you know and uh maybe you haven't started again maybe you have a major decision oh but you know there are many times when we feel like fainting even when you're in church you know one of my uh favorite songs you know that means salmos Favoritos is uh Psalm 73. I said you know with uh the um with asaph the chief musician amen amen he wasn't just a musician no solo foreign but he was one of the chief because that's right yes it was like William you know he's the chief musician oh but you know uh when I read the psalm he started like this he says God is good always Siempre to Israel Israel you know even Even in our struggles Even in our problems oh God it's good it's always good it's good that we struggle as well the struggle is yes how about you know what God's real too strong he'll make himself when you stop playing around that's the problem one more time that's the problem playing around too much let's get real foreign you telling this guy she wants to marry him and then he asks why do you want to marry me the guy always wants to know you know Kevin me you know what you want to know what you did right you know and she's like well yeah like you're a protector you're a provider you know you take care of me you know she's naming all these things and and you know she said he said that's that's and she's he's like that's fine that's fine you know that's that's why you want to marry me because I'm doing those things right now I'm doing them right now so I'm husband materials she's like yeah yeah you know that's why I love you yeah Ella who we are now you didn't finale all right we gotta be relentless that's right yes Relentless you know what religious means it means you can't sit still here the little kid always jumping around you know come on Nino when God has done something with it that is what you were called foreign all right he says this and he says and the last one that's cool he says that's the message I want him to bring for you and I assume oh your son his whole thoughts is upon you I'm close enough all he's trying to do is to please he's so interested in your referred to it's hard to hold them down he says I'd rather be just a little overzealous about the father's Kingdom than to have no Zeal at all for it says and as the Church of Christ preacher told me some time ago Mr Branham Senor Brandon I'd rather wear out in Russia and that is a lot of truth yes rather wear out and die in the harness oh then to refuse to have the harness on you can't do anything worse let us do all we can with what you have to do with and the Holy Spirit that's right that's yes you see we got he called us to do something we have a purpose the purpose is you've reached the price amen amen do you believe God do you believe his promise US how many believe God how many believe that there's a reward and then stop looking at what everybody else is doing foreign Las allejo through the fire said that's right that's correct so however we build however we're building the material that we're building we gotta be careful watch how we're building every work as individuals as individuals through the fire foreign El Fuego how we built commodificemos you know there's a story I want to close with about this uh farmer it says yeah he was in the agriculture business you know and uh he had a great desire one day you know uh everything that that he was uh that he desired he placed it in the in a but all his hopes and dreams in that in that seat amen amen it was a it was a bamboo tree and the Chinese bamboos what they call it bamboo and uh you know just like anybody I mean all of his vision everything that God had given him he placed it in those seats you know the word of God is the seed as well amen amen but they said you know that the seed it takes a long time you know for it to actually grow so in order for him to uh sustain his family you see he had to plant you know these other uh these other seeds as well you know but so in order for his family to eat but they said that he would you know he planted the seat all over the place foreign [Music] no your passes and you still see the same thing not only that so everybody tells you listening you're no different there's no change just give up that's a provencito that's what they tell us when we go to church there's no change he's a total failure and not only is he a failure but you're a failure too and it's discouraging yes the sanimante but when this farmer started this journey when he started the work he wanted to see it through he wanted to see it to the end two three years past still the same thing you see and the thing of it is those three years and every day of those three years he had to go water every hole every single home and it got to the point where his neighbors were laughing at him cuatro cincuanos and he was starting and he would just weep he would cry because he didn't see any fruit oh he saw was bearing ground oh he saw was the dirt but you know that fifth year came around and one day he went out there and there was a big scream you've owned he woke up the neighbors they woke up everybody that was around and the scene finally broke through [Music] it broke through after the fifth year and then everybody come around every seed that he had planted and then they came back the next day yeah grown five ten feet six weeks it hadn't grown in [Music] did it grow in five weeks and Cinco semanas absolutely not absolutely no it grew in the five years they grew into five years the only problem was that nobody could see what was going on inside this is so much that's right it's not so important but it was the work that's much more important those were the lessons it's not so much what we can see results and you put it on this I they're not in vain it'll happen there are times when I don't know if I can continue either okay it's difficult but one thing I know when I started this I was committed I was committed to God [Music] I love God so much [Music] brother Branham says that that's the only thing that's going to endure it's love El Amor you know we say we love we love the Homeland that's right as yes [Music] but you know the greatest way to show love you say you love the homelands when you say heaven is my home we say this world is Heaven is my home I have a resting place When You Say You Love Heaven and you love the Homeland the way you show it is when you love his people is when you love his people that proves that you love who says and that's the only thing that's going to endure yes you love your children when you love your brothers when you're not expecting anything back you do good because it's the right thing to do yes he said that's when you know true love is when you just love peace on Earth and Good Will to Manas voluntary Lombre that's what he came to do I said that's what we should do let's look at the vemos I said that should be the reward I said everybody said to do good please stand you know the altar's open no the year's gonna end here soon but you know there's still work to do let's just make sure that whatever we do okay agamos let's do it in love God bless you [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you're out of the sky inside [Music] [Music]
