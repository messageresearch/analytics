[29:30] Titus
[29:34] foreign
[29:54] for your fine attentions uh
[30:02] one of my members might stay behind how
[30:05] well you treat us
[30:07] but if they stay behind they stay in
[30:10] good hands
[30:11] soy content of the
[30:15] election
[30:16] I'm very happy that great a number of
[30:19] the church could be here
[30:23] to know that this place is small but
[30:26] Iglesia local for the number of the
[30:28] local church
[30:29] [Music]
[30:33] not only that but locally we have
[30:35] understood
[30:39] that you have two Services due to space
[30:42] [Music]
[30:47] and we thank the local church members to
[30:51] give us space to be here in this morning
[30:53] thank you very much
[30:59] when I think on what a service or church
[31:02] is is
[31:10] a rejoicing
[31:12] this is
[31:19] the messenger says that we were made to
[31:21] worship Him
[31:26] and that's every one of ours of us our
[31:30] duty
[31:31] when we come to church
[31:35] even if you don't like the song leader
[31:40] so you're in your duty to worship God
[31:42] Amen
[31:49] if they can replace you with a mannequin
[31:51] then it's serious amen amen
[31:56] imagine singing to God
[31:59] and the song says I lift up my hands
[32:03] and your hands back there in your
[32:05] pockets
[32:08] you're not living while you're singing
[32:18] you know when you surrender
[32:22] there's something that happens
[32:25] this is not a scolding this is a
[32:29] commercial
[32:31] to answer into what's coming yeah
[32:42] her inner feelings or delicate
[32:46] the word the bride says Amen to the
[32:48] words
[32:50] so let's recognize who we are
[32:54] I'm remembering
[32:59] the black man that was brought from his
[33:02] land a slave
[33:05] Cristiano brother Brandon types that man
[33:08] in the life of a Christian
[33:09] he knew who he was
[33:13] brother you don't know the problems I
[33:15] had in the morning
[33:17] even my wife beat me with the pan
[33:19] important
[33:21] it doesn't matter but when you two come
[33:24] to church you come to worship
[33:37] this is the way I worshiped
[33:42] worship before you can Brothers well
[33:45] you're gonna look strange in heaven
[33:50] it's a natural is the type of the
[33:52] spiritual yesterday we were in the park
[33:55] and we were rejoicing
[33:58] meeting each other
[34:01] but there was also another flock of
[34:03] ducks
[34:05] there was no way to silence
[34:09] they were also in a fellowship
[34:22] yes or yes
[34:24] [Applause]
[34:26] and the next service
[34:32] amen I'm a mannequin
[34:39] or am I a worshiper
[34:50] you come to a restaurant
[34:56] chips
[35:05] and they bring you chips and salsa when
[35:08] you come to the restaurant
[35:10] that's just to begin with until the meal
[35:12] arrives
[35:14] but sometimes the sauce is spicy
[35:18] the salsa is spicy
[35:22] so we thank God that he brought us
[35:24] safely
[35:25] to see our friends
[35:28] the last time he interpreted me
[35:33] and I said I feel sorry for him he's
[35:35] gonna have to go again pray for him
[35:40] a Bueno
[35:43] let's please stand hello
[35:46] Internet so the brother watching on the
[35:48] internet
[35:50] my name is
[35:55] pastor of Jerusalem Tabernacle
[35:58] we come from Tucson a
[36:02] buenos
[36:04] I come accompanying 25 people
[36:11] yeah
[36:14] brother last time you came you came with
[36:17] brother Montoya right I told them no he
[36:20] came with me not I with him
[36:47] it's something we wanted to do a long
[36:49] time ago
[36:52] and for certain reasons we couldn't
[36:57] and the church would always remind me
[36:59] when are we going to Colorado
[37:03] and this last camp in Phoenix Tabernacle
[37:08] my son Isaac is
[37:25] by the person he is
[37:28] he
[37:30] when he returned he told me
[37:34] um
[37:38] my friends from Colorado yes
[37:42] and they also tell us and when are you
[37:45] coming
[37:47] and I said what's promised is dead
[37:50] we told them we would be here
[37:53] and we're here now he
[38:19] but if God gives us more lives
[38:22] let's hope God allows us to be back
[38:28] Romans chapter 8 verse one
[38:33] and then we'll read verse 6.
[38:41] I hope you can be patient with me
[38:52] Romans 8 1 then verse 6.
[39:06] this is
[39:16] therefore now no condemnation to them
[39:19] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[39:21] after the flesh but after the spirit
[39:24] is
[39:28] minded as death but to be spiritually
[39:30] minded is life and peace let us pray
[39:34] kind Heavenly Jesus
[39:37] I ask you to call me Lord
[39:42] I can express the picture in my mind
[39:47] and May your children be helped please
[39:50] be with us
[39:52] in the name of Jesus we ask amen amen
[39:55] you may be seated
[40:00] if we could title our message
[40:05] we will title it being the image of
[40:08] Christ
[40:11] look I might not finish without
[40:13] certainly certainty I might not finish
[40:16] but knowing we were on our way here
[40:19] and we were threatened uh
[40:26] with the possibility of being in the
[40:29] program in the service
[40:34] you know you prepare if you need a song
[40:37] leaderman
[40:39] brother in Tucson that says
[40:42] let's untune this song
[40:47] or he needs to preach into his
[40:52] um so I began to ask the church
[40:55] is there a certain thought they want to
[40:58] know about
[40:59] no no no no no
[41:01] there wasn't a clear answer
[41:05] is specifically and I didn't have a
[41:08] specific message
[41:10] to speak this morning
[41:12] but Lord we are here
[41:16] I just don't want to get up here and
[41:18] yeah entertain the people that's not my
[41:22] job my job is to preach the gospel
[41:26] on Friday
[41:29] after my son was done testifying a
[41:33] scripture come to me
[41:35] and now I had something foreign
[41:51] and I said well I got something now
[41:53] there's something
[41:55] when the fellowship almost ended last
[41:58] night
[41:59] I came to my brother Josue
[42:04] and when I got close to him the title
[42:06] came to me
[42:09] it was a title that he used in one of
[42:11] his preachings and I said here it is
[42:20] may God forgive you
[42:34] they're there for now no condemnation to
[42:36] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[42:38] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[42:42] now we'll see scripturally what the
[42:44] spirit is
[42:46] the people say it's the holy ghosts
[42:57] because our message is being the image
[43:00] of Christ amen amen
[43:07] and for success for to be carnally
[43:10] minded is death but to be spiritually
[43:11] minded is life and peace
[43:14] now let's turn to Revelation
[43:16] chapter 3
[43:20] verse 22
[43:24] it is
[43:30] I hope you're looking for Revelation
[43:32] it's the last book I hope you're not in
[43:33] Genesis
[43:39] there's people that say where's matthew
[43:41] New or Old Testament
[43:44] and I say well I at least it doesn't say
[43:47] Matthew's in Tucson
[43:50] foreign
[43:53] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[43:56] the churches okay
[43:58] so when we see the scripture
[44:03] we find out that occupying the spirit is
[44:08] occupying the words
[44:12] because here is saying who happen here
[44:15] let him hear what the spirit says so the
[44:18] spirit speaks
[44:23] the way we think is by the spirit
[44:26] because
[44:30] but he just didn't do things the way we
[44:33] sometimes do things
[44:34] first he thought it is
[44:39] that's what he was doing in eternity
[44:42] before he brought in Adam
[44:45] thinking about everything he would bring
[44:48] thinking about you your eyes
[44:55] everything you are hello he was thinking
[44:59] about it
[45:00] how ungrateful are
[45:13] he's spent an eternity thinking
[45:20] about every leaf of every tree
[45:24] the colors
[45:30] supposedly well all trees are green in
[45:33] in the spring but
[45:36] not all have the same green
[45:42] darker green or light green
[45:45] God was thinking about us
[45:49] every vein that's in the leaves God was
[45:52] thinking about
[45:53] God is a god of details
[45:58] he was thinking about you and your
[46:00] characteristics
[46:03] even what you would go through and how
[46:06] he would watch for you
[46:07] everything God planned everything
[46:12] important and he said I'm going to send
[46:14] the most important
[46:17] so when we see here it foreign
[46:30] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[46:32] flesh but after the spirit
[46:36] now to be image of Christ is image of
[46:39] the word
[46:41] your motto should be the word seriously
[46:44] yesterday
[46:46] look when you begin coming to church
[46:50] you say I want to be like the brothers
[46:53] to start it's fine to be like
[46:58] but if you knew what the brother did
[47:00] when no one sees him
[47:04] foreign
[47:42] and your Pokemon is I can make mistakes
[47:47] not that I can I do them
[47:51] there's someone that says brother we're
[47:53] not perfect
[47:56] well depending what Perfection we're
[47:58] talking about seriously yesterday
[48:02] because if the Perfection is for no one
[48:05] to make mistakes then no one will be
[48:06] perfect
[48:08] the Perfection the Bible speaks
[48:12] it's for you to believe the word and
[48:14] live it yes yes the Bible says they hope
[48:18] that job
[48:21] was perfect and righteous before God
[48:24] but not before men this is
[48:28] yeah you made this in this mistake
[48:32] why was he perfect
[48:37] because he always said the word and God
[48:39] as his modeling example but without a
[48:43] doubt
[48:49] I was single no no no no
[48:52] I wasn't single I was already married
[48:55] and they invited me to preaching
[48:57] California Garcia so I went with Greg
[48:59] Garcia yeah
[49:02] they invited me to preach
[49:04] and he said wait boys I'll make a
[49:08] program and I'll let you know okay
[49:11] so I stay still
[49:13] and no one told me anything else
[49:18] and later the brothers were expecting me
[49:20] over there to preach and I didn't go
[49:23] nobody told me anything so
[49:27] um
[49:40] they were complaining to me and I
[49:42] exposed to them the situation
[49:45] and I told my pastor told me to wait
[49:48] until he gave me instructions
[49:51] and while the brothers were there
[49:53] waiting for me
[49:56] and I told him why were you waiting for
[49:58] me if the pastor never told me so I went
[50:01] to speakers
[50:05] and to top it off he told me
[50:10] hey weren't you supposed to be in
[50:12] California preaching
[50:16] and I told him you told me to wait for
[50:19] your indication
[50:21] and he told me oh that was true
[50:25] he said now I realize
[50:27] that I'm my God you'll see and I said oh
[50:31] really
[50:33] not only do I forgive but I forget
[50:39] yes
[51:42] no extra
[52:00] now if you're in the group of the ones
[52:04] that are crazy
[52:06] yes that little group of people that
[52:09] believe in the message
[52:11] and believe in a messenger and a prophet
[52:14] is
[52:15] now let's search what the messenger says
[52:20] because the prophet messenger gives the
[52:22] instructions
[52:25] and now we find a group of interpreters
[52:29] that he did not mean to say this
[52:32] what he really meant to say
[52:35] or what he meant to say was what he said
[52:38] yes or yes
[52:44] now you remember the story of that of
[52:47] that cousin
[52:52] or when the owner of the of the property
[52:55] came of the ranch
[52:57] that was looking for a bride it is
[53:06] they even had boots and pistols
[53:17] and the man that was looking there said
[53:19] no I see this in Chicago
[53:21] I'm looking for something different
[53:25] he said he said he went out and he was
[53:28] searching
[53:30] and he saw this woman throwing water out
[53:34] he came close and started a conversation
[53:38] and in the conversation
[53:43] he saw that she had the characteristics
[53:46] of a wife
[53:49] and he says that she captivated him with
[53:52] his with her words
[53:54] and she was all nervous
[53:58] her garments were dirty because she was
[54:00] cleaning
[54:01] but in that conversation
[54:05] he dare tell her
[54:07] will you marry me
[54:09] is
[54:12] he playing with me is he joking with my
[54:15] mind but he was serious
[54:27] certain time
[54:32] she said he said she prepared she began
[54:36] to prepare herself yes and her cousins
[54:39] told her
[54:41] and look each other he didn't mean to
[54:44] say that
[54:46] the bride has a messenger
[54:50] received a message from Eliza
[54:53] what he said is
[55:13] [Applause]
[55:33] Just One More Time Lord
[55:37] can you allow me to read a couple quotes
[55:39] seriously yes or yes
[55:44] let me find it brother
[55:47] thanks to God for tech technology
[55:58] preached in
[56:00] 1963-0-120
[56:02] in the evening
[56:08] paragraph 76 and 77 says this is
[56:12] how the messenger says how many of you
[56:16] believe the messenger
[56:24] but it's gonna benefit us
[56:28] I'm gonna tell you a quick testimony
[56:31] I fear needles
[56:35] and that's why I I don't like getting
[56:37] sick you just have a disease
[56:40] and they say that needles hurt but help
[56:43] the quickest
[56:45] brother they call me the turkey
[56:50] because I can take all the pills but
[56:52] hopefully they don't inject me
[56:55] uh injections hurt they they help
[56:59] seriously yes yes that's how the message
[57:02] is
[57:03] but it helps
[57:06] it says
[57:08] see
[57:10] Dios
[57:22] um
[57:25] that's how the devil is yeah
[57:30] and the clock is running and there's
[57:33] tension is
[57:36] that we put the preacher nervous he
[57:39] makes The Interpreter nervous
[57:42] and if he doesn't make them nervous he
[57:44] makes a person back here nervous yes he
[57:46] is is she no longer and if he can
[57:48] accomplish that
[57:50] he makes Universe nervous
[58:21] now you know them people over there they
[58:23] do that they watch this
[58:25] that's not your example Christ is your
[58:29] example he said
[58:32] giving you an example
[58:35] let him be your example yes
[58:40] now you say Christ is the one that was
[58:43] at Calvary
[58:45] now here's the quote this is
[58:49] Moses was the word in his days William
[58:58] yes or yes
[59:00] foreign
[59:51] we'll go to the message
[59:54] the world is falling to peace
[59:58] only the title scares you the world has
[1:00:02] fallen to pieces
[1:00:06] if it's falling apart there's no secure
[1:00:08] place
[1:00:10] but God made an exit
[1:00:14] God made a safe place
[1:00:18] God always provides a place
[1:00:24] the word amen amen
[1:00:32] the world is falling apart preach 1963.
[1:00:37] o412
[1:00:44] is
[1:00:50] let's read paragraph 160.
[1:00:57] this is
[1:01:02] but no thought is up for you
[1:01:06] allow it to dwell in here
[1:01:11] the thoughts that were in Christ and
[1:01:13] that's the word
[1:01:19] as human beings we have good ideas
[1:01:23] but the one that's right is the word
[1:01:26] amen amen
[1:01:28] let's go to another quote
[1:01:31] they're all pointing to the word
[1:01:36] and the master is the token
[1:01:39] foreign
[1:01:49] in the morning
[1:01:55] and let's read paragraph 345
[1:02:01] it is
[1:02:03] and the prophet says in this quote
[1:02:09] let me be a brother
[1:02:17] a brother to a brother let me be an
[1:02:19] example of examples
[1:02:22] look when I mentioned Christ
[1:02:25] automatically
[1:02:27] because Christ and the world
[1:02:30] are two no no
[1:02:33] okay I'm in the wrong church then
[1:02:37] Christ in the world or how many
[1:02:40] res
[1:02:44] now often we can change what the word
[1:02:46] says right
[1:02:49] so instead of twice we can say the word
[1:02:52] I began to play with your mind now this
[1:02:55] is he it says
[1:02:57] I'm gonna switch it here a little bit me
[1:03:15] because the word of God and Christ are
[1:03:17] one seriously yes or yes
[1:03:29] let me be a
[1:03:37] minister to the ministers
[1:03:40] foreign
[1:04:05] what does the devil think about us
[1:04:14] maybe he has wrong information seriously
[1:04:17] yes or yes
[1:04:29] schools
[1:04:36] no brother look
[1:04:39] I want to motivate your face you have a
[1:04:43] model and that's the word
[1:04:48] but see what happens when they give the
[1:04:51] wrong information
[1:04:55] says that Peter was telling John
[1:04:58] okay
[1:05:07] and Peter told him everything that Paul
[1:05:10] did Juan is
[1:05:17] John heard all that and he nourished of
[1:05:20] everything that Peter said about Paul is
[1:05:25] and it happened that John's uh he had a
[1:05:30] flat tire by Paul's house
[1:05:32] and he remembered that Paul lived in the
[1:05:35] neighborhood
[1:05:39] find out if he has a jack because I need
[1:05:41] one
[1:05:53] and as he was going he was remembering
[1:05:55] all the erroneous things that Peter told
[1:05:57] him about Paul
[1:05:58] and he thought about himself says when
[1:06:02] he showed up knocked on the door Paul
[1:06:05] opens the door
[1:06:08] and when Paul sees him he says
[1:06:11] I'm glad to see you
[1:06:15] and John was reasoning everything Peter
[1:06:18] told him
[1:06:19] and that he said if you want don't even
[1:06:21] borrow your jack absence
[1:06:25] sometimes they give you wrong
[1:06:26] information about the brothers
[1:06:36] be the word
[1:06:39] let's continue here
[1:06:52] let me show to the world that this word
[1:06:55] is Christ is
[1:07:05] and the only way I can do it is coming
[1:07:07] to him because I can't do it myself you
[1:07:10] can do it
[1:07:19] and you become one and then it lives
[1:07:22] itself out
[1:07:35] you are in Walking episode of Jesus
[1:07:37] Christ when he has got complete control
[1:07:39] control of you to make every word
[1:07:44] may that be may this be our objective
[1:07:47] what does brother Branham say COC yes or
[1:07:50] yes what does the Bible say when the
[1:07:54] preacher comes up you're following him
[1:08:08] the teachers the
[1:08:11] evangelists
[1:08:15] you are judging them by the words
[1:08:19] if they're in the word what they're
[1:08:21] preaching seriously yes
[1:08:24] but you don't judge the messengers
[1:08:27] you take what he said and say Amen
[1:08:32] so we need to be involved so much in the
[1:08:34] world to how many of you has it ever
[1:08:38] happened
[1:08:41] and because his movie
[1:08:45] begins to tell a story that brother
[1:08:47] Brandon relates
[1:08:50] and then the nerves changed the lower
[1:08:53] paper wasn't his intention
[1:08:57] and you say in your mind no it he didn't
[1:09:00] say like this he said it this way
[1:09:01] seriously yes or yes
[1:09:05] you know nervousness is betraying the
[1:09:08] brothers
[1:09:10] you're trying to see where he's leading
[1:09:13] you or what's his point
[1:09:15] but you're so informed in the world
[1:09:18] that you already know the story COC
[1:09:21] yesterday
[1:09:22] no you already know no it's not like
[1:09:25] that
[1:09:26] I myself when I see my own videos I say
[1:09:29] I has this I missed it right seriously
[1:09:33] yes
[1:09:35] and when I say the truth I say Amen
[1:09:39] there's tremendous to preach
[1:09:43] no one like him
[1:09:46] you gotta think that you're the best
[1:09:49] and cheer yourself
[1:09:53] or do the youth not stand in the mirror
[1:09:55] and then they jump to east side and then
[1:10:00] and in their mind
[1:10:02] others no one like me seriously yes sir
[1:10:06] yes
[1:10:11] and I would look at myself in the mirror
[1:10:14] and in my mind
[1:10:18] you're driving crazy
[1:10:27] in the desert
[1:10:30] Ed
[1:10:32] that's how you need a thinking Christian
[1:10:34] Life the same thing
[1:10:38] I believe the message
[1:10:42] and I live for it seriously yes or yes
[1:11:17] yes or yes
[1:11:19] it's part of
[1:11:36] let you in the world be one and then
[1:11:38] it'll live itself out
[1:11:44] Jesus Christ
[1:11:52] you are a walking episode of Jesus
[1:11:54] Christ when he has got complete control
[1:11:56] control over you to make every word
