god was preparing to do something with the people of israel [Music] not because he stuck his foot in the expression [Applause] is a different vision the first was in 605 bc irrecordamous de que we remember that daniel and the three hebrew man they were a part of that first exile and also the royal family and in that time jehoiakim was the king of israel if you read the bible you'll come across these names and to [Music] [Music] and not only him but the majority of the people came with in that in that second invasion with disease it was the greatest invasion that year paranthesis joaquin and at that time the king jehovah joaquin the first one is jehoiakim and the second one is [Applause] he came from israel and went to babylon i wouldn't call it a third invasion because there wasn't very many people implementing and the little people people that stayed there on that third exile the bible says that they fleed okay we have to go through these things because it's good to know where we're standing it's good to get excited but we need to understand the word as well and what everything that had that had to remain the purpose of and we prefer a different solution and because [Music] from

live in the second exile how much they have felt just think of the pain that these people were going through and the bible begins to say psalms 137 by the rivers of babylon tamus that's right in the midst thereof when they played the harp there in jerusalem all that left them required of us a song the same people that had them captive cantatus alabanzas victoria sing your songs of victory [Music] that you sing saying a senior song is a victory now and they that wasted us required of us that's what the world does [Music] is sing us one of the songs of zion if i do not remember that you let my
