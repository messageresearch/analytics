take us Lord myself as for your bride father let's open up our Bibles to First Peter capitulo cuatro chapter four verse 12 to 13. and the word of the Lord says like this beloved is the fiery trial which is true try you as though some strange thing happened unto you know we're rejoicing as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that one is Glory shall be revealed you may all be glad also with exceeding Joy God bless you Brothers you may be seated almost uh the topic they're the idea that I bring Brothers is times of trial s how many know that we are living in the difficult times Brothers we are living truly in times better that we were elected to live in and I believe that beforehand God knew bro amen that every one of us that are here man I believe that God has allowed us the best yes so that is his word Brothers amen because when you have the word Brothers amen foreign uh Gustavo I mean our brother gustavo's uncle is he was the president the youth president now was the vice I would say que dios that God amen pero transl the time came and I believe that I was at the highest I've learned the spiritual spiritually speaking I would say that I would never fall amen and I hope that this this evening that each and every one of us foreign amen amen but I was in the highest Brothers win amen let me tell you that is I spent a lot of time there foreign I remember that but I began to pray change Brothers time came that I had prayed so much says when you can take out the best of you and we see here Brothers and I remember it was a Sunday the service finished the Sunday service the Sunday School service okay and I remember that I stayed here I said Lord forgive me I know that I failed from here on out the face of an elderly woman she told me what do you need this and she told me like this she said because God has sent me she said God has heard your prayer he said yes God has forgiven you she said us being the way we are says amen sometimes I begin to think senior yeah orange and when he would get there to Orange he would preach and he would say these things Brothers you would speak about his children my children are here with me they accompany me this is amen because they need to live that experience that experience with God because meanwhile you don't see it is Elijah said he was righteous foreign that the same thing was going to happen to him he was scared Brothers to desperation amen Brothers [Music] the people of Israel when he went through the Red Sea amen amen we can see that imagine Brothers making a wall on each side and how it is that the people of of God they went through [Music] that even it was meant until the last one went through he was shut amen when the sea shut up if the Bible says or the song says it says that he closed it as well I can't imagine la and all the soldiers this uh how can we say when it comes and the Egyptians amen roses says that is a jubilee we see that it says that is that the people began to complain amen amen it is nature itself shows us foreign strongest he's not going to attack the strongest the one that's wounded animals and so then us Brothers if we allow ourselves as he was a couple days ago a year ago necessary that we see God amen amen Hermanos and we see Brothers there's a song that I really like when I feel weak ermanos and to see Brothers it says even even then I'm here even now I'm here not because I want to [Music] um when I hear it how many models have we not fought Brothers it says sometimes amen let me tell you that if you're a Son of God you seek the things of God let me tell you at one point brother Brandon asked the question and he said how many children of God are there amen children of God are in this place Brothers so then it's not because we're strong Brothers amen but if we do the will of God God will be with us it's not going to leave us that he started in us and if we were important not matter man Brothers God is going to help us keep going forward I'm going to leave the place to my brother for him to come forward bless you [Applause] thank you God bless our brother Victor um I enjoy when they share that they had struggles again it's grace and mercy that we're here man estamos um we're speaking on the Book of Judges and in Judges chapter 6 in versicolono and the first one we'll be reading is and the children of Israel did Evil and the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of media in seven years the people of Israel um you told them to follow their word um and they did it for a certain time is but it came to the time the point came for the children of Israel where they forgot who their God was I forgot everything God had done for them and questions and judges also says that they never expelled the Canaanites God is and the people of Israel little by little prostituted themselves with the candidates establish themselves together they adopted their culture and religion there was a moral corruption ninos they sacrificed children and they worship idols basically Israel Israel Israel is is a Canaanite it was a time of Darkness and they turned like the Canaanites against God and When sin comes is when soon came they were oppressed and conquered by the Canaanites and eventually the Israelites noticed this is and they repented and cried to God so God heard the Cry of his people again delivery a judge amongst the people of Israel that will defeat the Canaanites there was peace for a while but the people of Israel sinned again so basically it was uh and another side and God will hear the Cry of his people and he would raise but then they left God's way again Israel's condition was horrible God would raise men and women but again the people of Israel would forget they forgot the god of their fathers that's what was the problem brothers because they never made the god of their fathers their God yes they began to speak like this is they were people of Israel but at their own way yeah see and that is in this age they we live or they live how they work lukewarm they do whatever they want they do it and not in God's way we even do Church our own way in need and there we cried cigar as in this time Studios they have forgotten their God I had to preach two Fridays ago and last Friday but I got sick more time for myself to be in my illness you've got to put something in my heart hey comments next time and I began to examine myself I began to analyze my life Cristiana and I said how is my Christian Life I'm not only speaking I'm going to church I'm not only speaking three times a week um Leader song leading here or preaching here yesterday it happened with the people of Israel they left God play with the world so how we were sometimes used we lift up idols Bernie samosas we prioritize other things I speak for myself I'm no one to judge good says the judges they were elected they stood up for God the angel s but he had to fix things had to remove it God could help them that's how maybe our lives could be today our relationship with God Is Not the Same [Music] okay why don't you stand off regardless bothering you in your life and I enjoy them too much prioritize that more than God soccer for me priority to Jesus [Music] stand up for God speaks in the church Chinese condition and I saw this on YouTube I was watching and something about brother Brandon and I took that is speaking about Daniel Curry he was an evangelist died and history says or the story says that he died and he went to the Gates of Heaven I don't know if anyone has or knows about this I've gained more than one thou 1 000 souls for Christ a and they went over the list and they told him his name was not found there they said they told him we don't have mercy for you here Daniel here do you want to appeal yeah he said yes where can I go well went through the space he went to the white judgment throne and he says that's where God's presence was to us and they asked him have you yeah and he said yes have you ever stolen he said and he said yes and they told him that you aren't perfect I'll be condemned sweeter than a mother he turned back he says at the face that
