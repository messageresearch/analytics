[21:46] I work with them
[21:48] not that they work with me
[21:52] they work with me and I work with them
[21:55] yes
[22:14] we're going to read um Philippians 3
[22:17] chapter verse 12 13 and 14.
[22:20] Philippines
[22:25] Philippians 3 verse 12 13 and 14.
[22:41] I just want to be obedient to him
[22:45] foreign
[23:04] Ed either were already perfect but I
[23:07] follow after and that I may apprehend
[23:10] that for which also I am apprehended of
[23:12] Christ jesusado
[23:26] verse 13 Brethren I count not myself to
[23:29] have apprehended but there's one thing I
[23:32] do forgetting those things which which
[23:34] are behind and reaching forth unto the
[23:36] things which are before
[23:42] I pressed I pressed toward the mark for
[23:45] the price of the High Calling of God in
[23:47] Christ Jesus
[23:52] thank you for the opportunity you give
[23:54] us Lord
[23:56] we're here in this place
[24:06] take anything that's contrary to your
[24:08] words
[24:16] but you are the only one that deserves
[24:18] it
[24:23] you may be seated
[24:28] services
[24:34] and the second Services we've been
[24:37] speaking on a purpose and a vision
[24:39] and that is our title
[24:43] our subject and as a thought for this
[24:45] morning
[24:48] it is High Calling
[24:53] we've seen throughout the months
[24:57] each and every one of us has a purpose
[25:00] it doesn't matter who you are important
[25:03] no matter where you come from
[25:05] no matter who your parents is
[25:10] the son of the brother that cleans the
[25:13] church
[25:17] to fulfill
[25:19] a
[25:57] that should be a priority but what is
[25:59] holding us back
[26:01] what is bothering us from fulfilling our
[26:04] purpose
[26:08] hey
[26:14] when I see it and the brothers has
[26:16] spoken to us many times
[26:19] that we have to let go of things
[26:25] in our life
[26:28] a
[26:29] you can mirror studio and when I see and
[26:32] I study
[26:34] I saw some Biblical characters
[26:39] some great characters and I've seen
[26:41] their life yes
[26:44] at a certain point in their life
[26:47] they were afraid
[26:52] it is
[26:54] they were afraid to fulfill their
[26:56] calling
[27:01] so then I ask myself
[27:04] if they were afraid is
[27:07] it bad for us to be afraid
[27:12] fear is nothing bad
[27:15] how we react towards that fear
[27:18] foreign
[27:26] of the Bible
[27:29] says
[27:31] many times fear took them to be cowards
[27:35] do you know what a coward is
[27:39] someone who that knows what they should
[27:41] and they don't do it
[27:45] they take a step back
[27:50] a coward is always looking back
[27:53] [Music]
[27:55] they're always putting excuses
[27:58] a phrase says
[28:03] you will never make history in your
[28:05] comfort zone
[28:08] a cow will always stay in their Comforts
[28:12] they want everything to come to them
[28:18] all the blessings come to them sitting
[28:20] down at church
[28:21] and they don't want to put the effort
[28:24] come on
[28:26] this is
[28:29] in the message a hidden life
[28:35] he speaks about a young boy who won a
[28:37] bicycle
[28:40] this is
[28:43] and if I will look at the present times
[28:47] are the things it is
[28:51] I would be a very discouraged person
[28:54] if we pay attention
[28:57] so what is happening around
[29:02] we're going to get discouraged
[29:06] right
[29:08] and even more if we look back
[29:11] if we look at our mistakes
[29:16] were the mistakes of someone else
[29:20] discourage us
[29:22] it will take us to cowardness
[29:29] he says but I learned the lesson one
[29:31] time
[29:33] a little thing that I heard a man say
[29:35] yes
[29:38] they were going to give away swim
[29:40] bicycle to the best Rider they said you
[29:42] know
[29:44] I don't know whether I ever quoted it in
[29:46] this church
[29:50] he said the boy that could ride a
[29:53] 12-inch plank
[29:54] 100 yards
[30:04] around the city they thought they could
[30:06] write it
[30:07] and was going to win the cards
[30:11] and they had a little one little boy
[30:14] there was kind of a yes
[30:27] it's someone that's it's uh feminine
[30:38] and when he speaks about David
[30:42] um
[30:43] he was a fearful young man he was
[30:46] fearful
[30:47] that was his aspect
[31:04] if we go by what we see foreign
[31:20] they say
[32:00] said when they started off they gave
[32:03] them a little push so that they could
[32:04] get started
[32:05] hold them up and let them start
[32:10] sometimes we all need a little push
[32:18] that they were with him are you randomly
[32:21] helping him
[32:32] on fire
[32:35] behind you so you can see
[32:40] a little push Brothers
[32:46] all the great people go and look at the
[32:49] stories
[32:50] they needed a little push they needed a
[32:53] push
[33:22] so when they start you off to say you
[33:24] were looking down like this trying to
[33:25] keep your bicycle on board
[33:29] but said I never noticed
[33:33] I see and you do that
[33:36] and it makes you nervous Hermanos
[33:46] because that person is
[33:55] why doesn't he put the the the the
[33:57] firewood
[34:00] the chairs the tables
[34:03] I always have to do it
[34:07] but see I never looked down
[34:11] so when you do that it makes you nervous
[34:14] I said you fell off
[34:18] I just put my
[34:39] at the end
[34:43] another phrase says
[34:47] instead of giving up your projects
[34:50] give up laziness
[34:53] give up excuses
[34:57] because we're good to give excuses
[35:12] to a certain point in my life
[35:14] foreign
[35:42] [Music]
[36:16] where they put the metal
[36:19] and it
[36:21] um melts
[36:24] to a certain degree but it has to go
[36:26] through a fire it has to go through a
[36:28] process
[36:35] of giving ourselves
[36:55] when I was young
[36:58] I saw my parents Take Me to Church
[37:02] and good thing and you have to travel
[37:04] hours
[37:10] I
[37:12] didn't even want to go to church
[37:17] foreign
[38:06] or fasting
[38:09] Anton says then
[38:16] it was too much to go to church it was
[38:19] too much to go to church
[38:24] there was a time where I had to make my
[38:27] decisions
[38:31] and a servant of God
[38:33] you have to make a decision
[38:37] that time will always come
[38:40] together and the point that it came in
[38:42] my life
[38:46] the point in taking the decision is
[38:50] if I wanted to be continue
[38:54] put the effort to be brave
[39:00] many times we imagine
[39:09] it requires of an effort so great
[39:20] heavy burden
[39:24] is
[39:28] when I decided to serve God
[39:47] you're already born with it
[40:04] Holy Ghost
[40:07] s
[40:09] the calling is subject to The Giver of
[40:13] the calling yeah
[40:19] they don't take us into account
[40:24] I want to be something big we don't want
[40:28] to be something small yes another
[40:45] [Music]
[41:13] we're doing it for us foreign
[41:59] says living for others is a rule of
[42:02] nature
[42:03] is living for others as a rule of nature
[42:09] life is good when you are happy
[42:12] but life is much better
[42:15] when others are happy because of you
[42:18] know
[42:19] he does not live to serve he does not
[42:23] serve to live
[42:40] not according to ourselves
[42:44] but according to his own purpose
[42:48] which was giving us Jesus
[42:51] in Christ Jesus before the world began
[42:55] we have a holy
[42:58] to fulfill
[43:01] apocalypse so in Revelation 21 uh
[43:09] it speaks of the overcomer
[43:15] and it also speaks of those who are not
[43:17] okay
[43:19] and the first one that I mentioned that
[43:21] is not an overcomer
[43:24] Revelations 21 7 says
[43:28] and a person first first coward
[43:31] incredible for an unbeliever
[43:36] credulous
[43:38] foreign
[43:55] ERS and warmongers and Sorcerers and
[43:58] idolaters and all liars shall have their
[44:00] part in the lake which burneth with fire
[44:03] and brimstone which is the second death
[44:06] to a certain extent is
[44:12] for you it's easy to say
[44:14] the family that you come from
[44:19] he's a pastor
[44:26] his purpose
[44:38] see you've got to be in touch with it
[44:51] you say well you ought to be easy for
[44:53] you brother anything you do God just
[44:55] tell you he said no and he says
[44:58] he doesn't
[45:02] I sweat it out like you do yeah and a
[45:06] whole lot harder
[45:09] sure I have to sweat it much harder than
[45:12] you
[45:13] and there's going to be more
[45:15] requirements
[45:22] receive the greatest you say
[46:25] and it didn't work
[46:28] until one did work
[46:30] together
[46:54] it is if it don't fire I won't quit
[46:58] I'll throw that one out as a third and
[47:00] China

[47:41] God bless you
[47:44] [Applause]
[47:49] foreign
[48:28] amen amen
[48:33] if you can follow me to the scripture in
[48:36] Proverbs 29.
[48:39] chapter 29 verse 18.
[48:43] uh
[48:46] as you find it
[48:49] I heard the story of a father
[48:54] it's almost like a poem they were saying
[48:57] uh
[49:00] a
[49:02] [Music]
[49:04] el padre
[49:06] and he was asking on the father's
[49:08] responsibility
[49:11] and he was saying
[49:13] teach my children to be good children
[49:18] who will teach my children to love the
[49:21] Lord
[49:24] we will teach my children to be a good
[49:27] Christian
[49:29] responsibility
[49:31] on who does that responsibility fall
[49:34] well
[49:36] it falls on me
[49:41] how to be a good Christian
[49:43] I want to show my son
[49:47] to be a true Son of God
[49:50] our own responsibility as parents
[49:55] teach our family
[50:19] where there is no vision the people
[50:21] perish in English in English it says
[50:24] well there is no vision
[50:29] El Pueblo Perez the people perish amen
[50:32] amen
[50:34] you must have a vision amen amen
[50:39] we must know where we're going
[50:43] what do we want to build
[50:46] just a nice Church
[50:50] you know there's many nicer churches in
[50:53] this one
[50:54] Iglesia if we're chasing a church
[50:57] full of members
[51:01] there are churches with five thousand
[51:05] members
[51:06] but what are we trying to reach
[51:11] I believe our pastor's visions
[51:16] and he confessed the first time he
[51:18] preached about this subject
[51:21] he said from this church
[51:23] there would be men capacitados that were
[51:27] capable
[51:42] why is God moving and foreign
[52:29] amen
[52:40] [Applause]
[52:41] amen
[52:46] well my question is can he do everything
[52:49] you cannot do it alone
[53:02] I have good preachers
[53:26] don't just be a good preacher says
[53:44] transmitted
[53:53] [Music]
[53:54] that's where we're headed
[53:57] I don't believe it
[54:02] yeah we have good
[54:06] choirsias then we would be far from them
[54:08] but the prophet said yes
[55:08] voice of God
[55:42] he could not see to get around this is
[55:46] a great heavy man
[55:57] and he had began to let the work of the
[56:00] Lord go undone
[56:03] watch
[56:05] because there's no video
[56:08] because there wasn't a problem because
[56:11] there was in guidance
[56:17] and they were living
[56:20] incorrect lives
[58:00] follow them
[58:33] precious message
[58:40] because there was no vision the people
[58:43] perish
[58:45] what are we chasing what do you want
[58:48] from this church
[58:50] where are you headed
[58:52] do we want great choirs
[58:56] you know in the denomination
[59:01] they produce denominational children
[59:07] there isn't life
[59:12] foreign
[1:00:12] foreign amen
[1:00:48] we want to be church members comfortable
[1:01:02] your food
[1:01:04] you're so relaxed
[1:01:14] feed me feed me
[1:01:20] for lack of vision amen amen is
[1:01:30] organizations
[1:01:42] I think the church the organization and
[1:01:44] denominations they've been on the field
[1:01:46] for a long time
[1:01:47] yes
[1:01:49] and they're beginning getting laxed
[1:01:53] amen amen
[1:02:00] the prophet went to churches
[1:02:04] and they all rejected him the question
[1:02:07] was
[1:02:26] that's why the prophet was so rejected
[1:02:30] they even called him a Woman Haters
[1:02:35] I don't hate the women the sisters I
[1:02:39] love them
[1:02:40] I do this because
[1:02:43] the prophet would say it
[1:02:46] says you sister incorrectly
[1:02:53] fossil
[1:04:07] this morning what a tremendous message
[1:04:53] they got a tape from Brother Garcia
[1:05:09] says
[1:05:12] that God placed that sperm in there he
[1:05:16] is
[1:05:17] and that sounded horrendous
[1:05:20] horrible for them
[1:05:24] and they will say how is this is it
[1:05:26] possible that man can speak such a thing
[1:05:29] and I told them how are you doing
[1:05:33] if God would have wanted to form Jesus
[1:05:39] don't you think he would have been here
[1:05:42] he could have done it
[1:05:46] began how life begins with a sperm there
[1:05:50] is
[1:05:53] and that man grabbed the tape
[1:05:57] and destroyed it in his hand and said
[1:06:00] that's garbage
[1:06:02] you know where that man is
