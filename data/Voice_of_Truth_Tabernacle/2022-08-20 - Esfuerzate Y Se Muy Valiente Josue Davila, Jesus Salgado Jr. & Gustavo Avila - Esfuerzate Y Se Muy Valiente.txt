to the left that thou mayest prosper with whither so ever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest have served to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayest for the lord thy god is with you with with wheresoever thou goest amen may god bless his word let's pray father joshua from the tribe of ephron a server of moses a servant of moses a leader from a servant to a leader a leader from a follower to a leader a conquistador from a conqueror what a more joshua the bible says that he wasn't called that name he was called hosea significa it means jehovah is the one who makes salvation or is salvation and he made it very clear that that joshua lucharia he would fight lucharia he wouldn't fight or battle mask by the holy spirit jehovah amen typifies the holy spirit go to the bride i want to get to that promised land youth tiempo it's not time to surrender the people of israel joshua and caleb because they kept his word now let's go to joshua josue joshua deuteronomy says god was telling moses which standed before them for he shall cause israel for thou must go into the into this people into the land which the lord has sworn unto the first to give them and thou shalt cause him [Music] i didn't come to give up or to come back um quitter i'm not you know i'm not going to give up [Applause] is so will i be with thee amen they say so will i be with you i've never had much confidence anybody that's too afraid to do anything i'd much rather say be found i would rather the greatest uh that the balor phone company hired a man and he was going to sign his name and the man had no race lapis on the end of his pencils because if you make mistakes if you don't if you you don't make mistakes you won't do nothing that's true god hold you responsible for your mistakes you don't hold your response before your mistakes they used to sing a song that thrilled me they said go something like this and try me one more time i'll be yours if you'll be mine if i fall from is [Music] [Music] don't tell me [Music] young ladies young man [Music] wherewith thou shalt young man cleansed his way congratulations by keeping his word god bless you brothers [Applause] if i could please ask you to stand with me you know i believe if we come except expecting something from god god is more than happy to give it to you sometimes it just takes a little bit of believing a little bit of trusting in him sometimes we are so close to him god just asked a little bit more of you josue capitol uno first a and when you have you may say amen joshua chapter one says like this jose this book of the lost shall not depart out of thy mouth but you shall meditate their day and night that do make yourself serve due to the according to all that it is written therefore then you shall you shall make thy way prosperous and then do shall have a good success says i want to thank god for many things i want to thank him for allowing me to be here tonight and allow me to speak a little bit of of what god has given me yeah everything and in the story of joshua i noticed that one thing that josh had to have josue that he needed to have necessity it was people that were prepared for that battle person and they had fear of him of joshua no one could overcome him because what joshua had josue it was god by his side we have god by our side and there is nothing that can go against it was a thing against things that we cannot see with our eyes the bible says that our bad our fight is not against flesh and blood but it is against things that we don't see with our eyes against spirits of this world so we shouldn't be arguing with my brother or sister against certain things that we can show that there's a [Applause] but there is still hope for this world esperanza that god is still changing [Music] and he gives us the escape here brothers so much on god that we have the mind of christ that's the devil that the enemy brothers can i'll penetrate your thinking your mind has to but god is telling but when god truly comes to our lives finishes is itermina and we are back to our same life god doesn't want that youth he wants to dwell in you he wants he wants to live in you instead because when god lives in you when the holy spirit is truly in your heart you are sure what you are doing and the devil cannot cannot shake your is [Music] hey man i have a a message from brother branham random in the message word became flesh you know i believe that god is eternal amen and that he wants to live in us because he wants to give life to us just like this how eternal is the word of god all science will change then it is on to him it is the time to be brave enough to and carry this masters on because only a few of us will be able to carry this message on because this is not something easy brothers so we must fight to take what is ours you know joshua have to be brave and fight for what's happening then you must fight for what is yours when we meditate on god's word day and night when i realized everything else will pass away but there's one thing that won't pass away bro and that is god's word and you can take god's word and it against you in my that i still not in my heart against you but let me walk there you know i believe that god always has to be with us brothers now we is greater than any problem we have brothers you have the purpose of your life is he wants to to to manifest himself he needs brave people today how many want to be a few of those quantos [Applause] i'm very courageous notice that word vary i want you to focus on that a little bit my brother josue earlier described how a great responsibility because i believe it was a greater responsibility because it's easy to start something but it's a lot harder to finish it because once you start seeing the problems difficult things going on discouragement [Applause] but the great responsibility on the importance of a first-hand experience amen and i i feel it falls beautifully with what we're talking about today [Music] and in the same manner with joshua to have a certain type of strength and courage because remember the only way that the word of god can have power is when it becomes flesh in ourselves and nosotros and me when our own lives cuando nuestras but [Music] you got no idea what as i was with moses he says only be thou strong and very courageous he says observe to do according to i don't care what the organizations say or do anyhow and i love this part that's the joshua that god is waiting for is [Applause] and how joshua himself had a first-hand experience it's very important youth is important that you have your own experiences not someone else telling you no algebra strength and courage to take a stand foolish to man what you're doing here tonight i want to talk to you about that strength and courage that joshua that is different to what man can say strength and courage is foreign because a thief needs a certain type of strength and courage necessary but the strength encouraged that our god was telling joshua it's not a physical noise it's not a mental courage it says in zechariah to is still not enough you want more you require of a higher life but it's needed of strength and that's why we need a different lifestyle to leave your phone in your parents bedroom when you're used to having it with you at night it's needed of strength and courage to be the a only in that experience personal experience yes i experienced it joshua knew josue that god was capable when god said in three days we crossed jordan right now the jordan river is at its highest right now although i still mean moses although i saw him with moses okay you'll love me that good moisture today i see him with me although i saw him with my prophets okay that could be professor william branham william brother although i saw him with my apostles call me apostle to be able to say that which the ministers had that's what was theirs that that the whole message thing when it first started it only stays back there it's very pero the sons and daughters of god to the world oh blessed be the name of the lord and in today's day it's very hard it's mudify to go against the current [Music] what the word of god says it's hard it's difficult it's heavy but with the right spirits correct spirits holy spirit that la fuerza encourage ila valentia to be different differentes to want to live a better life like i said in the beginning [Music] [Music] amen that the devil keeps on telling you diablo [Music] wait until next year is [Music] when we try to when we see someone trying to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] they stay where you [Music] this is something more than what we see
