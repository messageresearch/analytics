the feast keeps on going they just gave me some few minutes to express some words to our pastor and we've walked together some time now it comes to mind and I was recalling when the Lord brought us to Colorado [Music] I believe we were crazy because we didn't know where we would get to or come to no work no church we didn't have any idea but I believe we came by faith and they asked a few times if he would move to a different [Music] state and I believe I'd had to fast and pray a lot and above all the the consideration of the pastor because coming here to Colorado that's what we did we fasted we prayed and I believe our Lord showed our pastor this was the place for us and many Souls have been reached I would like to thank our pastor and say thank you because it was only God to be able to leave a place and I believe many of you left family good paying jobs and everything for God and I feel up until now God has blessed us and we have all been privileged because of that I'm thankful with God for placing our brother Tito I believe it's God in him and there's no doubt any single one of us that God is in in him thank you brother Titus and thank you to sister brother BR says behind a good man is a good woman and I would like to congratulate him once again I know he's a little bit younger than me but I have learned a lot from him things from many errors I have I made and now I I give

bless the words we will dedicate in this service uh to our pastor thank you for the life you've given him we thank you for these 40 years that you have been with him and we ask that you stay with him the rest rest of the journey than morning in the name of Lord Jesus Christ take your seat so a different [Music] service we're going to be speaking in five minutes says how B when he the spirit of Truth is come brother brandham uses the scripture in a message a guide and I'm going to refer to it truly what a guide we have our guide is the holy spirit amen amen how many can say amen he is our guide brother Bram says it over and over doesn't matter how tremendous you are was a tremendous student or teacher but when it was about receiving the Holy Spirit have a new birth he needed a guide so it doesn't matter how tremendous we are how good people we are when it's about the New Birth you need a guide God for his guide brother Bram says about Cornelius have you read about Cornelius in the script Cornelius he was a great man honorable man churches he respected the Jews because he know his that their religion was right and he paid arms and he prayed every day but when the Holy Ghost come listen brother something had been added to the church he needed a guide and listen God sent him the Holy Ghost he sent it in the person of Peter Hallelujah he sends the Holy Spirit through a man God works in the same way that's why I thank God that God has placed here a man like our pastor that I believe with all of my heart that he is a man with the Holy Ghost the hlyh ghost dwells in him and he is the guide it's not brother Titus it's not the flesh but what's inside him says he sent the holy spirit to guide Cornelius and sent him to Peter sent it through Peter does it say like that or not he used because he sent Cornelius to the right for while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on him then he said can a man forbid water that these should not be baptized see still the guide speaking not Peter because that was a bunch of Jew or Gentiles unclean dirty to him and he didn't want to go but the guide said I'm sending you Hallelujah God bless [Applause] you um if you'd open your Bibles to 2 Corinthians chapter 4:8 I will be reading from 8 to uh 10 real uh it says like this says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair are persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed I read I'll continue always bearing about the Bo in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body uh you know this is Paul here you know I believe that every Christian uh um feels this way at one time or another and uh you know when uh I think of our pastor a lot of times uh you know how many times he must not feel like this uh but uh you know Paul was a very uh unique man because Paul was a very unique vessel and I believe that you know our pastor Pastor is is very unique in many ways and uh there's a something there was something about Paul uh you know Paul was he had a he had many many stripes uh you know in the Army the more stripes you have the higher in rank you are and uh you know so Paul Paul was he he he he uh he got many stripes on him uh but what I'm getting to is this is that you know the higher in rank you go you know I believe the the lonlier it gets uh but you know Paul you know no matter how high or how great the Revelation was he was always amongst the people people amen he never thought he was better than anybody and you know I believe our pastor you know reflects the same [Music] thing you know but we know it's Jesus Christ amen we know it's Jesus Christ through a vessel it's Jesus Christ through a man you know as a as we when I was at his party uh you know at his birthday party the other [Music] day I I I approached uh the the table of honors uh and of the accolades the accomplishments that he's that he's had throughout his life and uh and I just I was just reading some of the Articles and uh the ones that I read I don't think there was a single one where he didn't where he didn't mention uh you know God in in in in what he said it was always you know thank God it was always my God and and you know and it was just I I was looking at that you know how at such a young age uh you know he just completely trusted in God you know he's I believe he's been a Marked Man he he he's been he's been marked by God since the beginning and uh you know when when but you know he hasn't stopped the accomplishments haven't stopped amen because the awards you know the honors you know they were all given by man but he hasn't stopped because he still keeps accomplishing things not because he's waiting for something greater he's waiting for something more he's fighting for the the same crown that Paul was fighting for an Incorruptible Crown you know and I as I was thinking you know our pastor I was listening to uh you know Sister Raina and she was talking about how you know the Lord or how you know their mom abandoned them when they were younger you know that must have been a hard thing but one thing I can say one thing I can see through his life is that God never left you God was always with you and you haven't stopped because because we don't stop here we keep going for more we keep going for greater strive every day and he's pulling the cart we should be pulling with him God bless [Applause] you for the Holy Ghost give him a stronger clap offering glory to [Applause] God going to read quick John 1011 and John 1513 I'm the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd gives his life for the Sheep verse 13 says greater love has none one than this that a man lay down his life for his friends what a tremendous scripture I chose it because brother Titus is this for me my thought is not just any friend we don't have just any friend we have been blessed bless you have been blessed when the Lord Jesus Christ allowed him to be your friend now we don't have just any friend in the flesh maybe our brother Titus can fail but spiritually it's different when a friend fails you sometimes they fail you in the flesh but the Holy Spirit comes and pricks tells you go and fix with your friend because with that friend you are in this race and you're going to Eternity with that friend Amen brother when I think about a friend I think about Jonathan and David what great friends were they what great friends what a friend was Jonathan for David that even Jonathan's father wanted to kill him wanted to destroy him he threw a spear at him and wanted to kill David but Jonathan was there as a good friend not any friend because there are many that call themselves friends But when reality squeezes when you need a friend there you need a good friend not any friend you need the holy spirit in flesh in human flesh that can lift you up that's how the Holy Spirit dwells the holy spirit in human flesh brother Bram says his love did it his love paid for my sin his love took them away love is the most powerful force that exists and that's what our pastor shows don't get scared there's a lot of people that can get scared they can say oh they're boasting up the pastor oh let me let me boast him up I'm just gonna boast him more brother brother gar said people get afraid because brother Victor made a song for brother enri but how can they singara oh how much for us to a son filled with the Holy Spirit support him stand next not see the mistakes brother blessed be the name of the Lord take a husband that truly loves a wife and he will die for her without any price and Brotherly Love brother brandham speaks of a certain man he says a man certain man who comes to this church time to time lives in the country he was sitting at his brother's house the other day and asked him what if something happened to brother Bill and he answered with great pleasure I would put my chest to receive the bullet Jonathan just like Jonathan put his chest to receive the spear that they threw at David for his friend davidan and jonath was a type the Holy Spirit and brother Titus he's a type of the holy spirit in human flesh God bless you [Applause] Pastor God bless you brother Jeremiah 3:15 and I will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding the shoes of pastors and we begin like this if I was a pastor everything would be different if I was a pastor everything would be well I would do many changes if I were Pastor we'd be greater if I was Pastor I'd make less mistakes I'd know how to behave if I was a pastor everything would be peace and calm if I was a pastor if I was if I was if I was if I was and if I was is there but then this is the question why aren't you Pastor why are you not pastor and the answer is maybe God the ones that stay in their own thoughts aren't good for him the ones that feel that they can do it by themselves or they feel capable by their own but God God chooses those men that are according to his heart and Draw N to God with a humble heart with a humbled heart and beg here in my Lord let it be done to thy will and are willing to what God orders them in a distance the shoes of the pastor they look attractive but better said many there's many people that want to walk in those shoes but when you try to put them on they fit too big because to be a pastor is not only a title to be a genuine servant to God to be a genuine servant to the people it means to be prepared to serve at any time any place anywhere to be a pastor is to go the extra mile to have your mind made up to give everything for the rest to be a pastor many times it's to laugh many times is to enjoy many times is to be joyful but it's also crying being a pastor is to give counsel to the people it's a love and live for the people and feel for the people and not judge the people many want the pastor's shoes but many but few are willing to pay the price the value of the shoes of the pastor are not in the in how shiny they are are not in how much they shine it's not in how joyful they are but the true value of those shoes is how worn out they are is the color that has been fading are those scrapes and scratches of bending your knee of going the extra mile of walking and walking and give everything for your people the true price of the shoes of the pastor that's value our pastor and fight alongside him shoulder Tosh shoulder let's stand up for him brother Bram says in Q&A he refers to our brother Neville and he tells our beloved brother Neville here father he's laboring along a Shepherd here in the pasture field that's trying to lead the Sheep to the Green Grass and the Deep clover or out into the water and then back to the shade tree and caring for the sick and the needy and the little crippled ones and those that are weary and try to doctor them up and bring them so they'll be real sheep I believe we have a great pastor P God has blessed us with a great man and I believe God dwells in him God bless [Applause] you God bless you Brothers uh Luke 15 verse4 it says like this what man of you having 100 sheep if he lose one of them does not leave the 90 and n90 the Wilderness and go after that which was lost until he find it what man I say what God has God has given us in this church been an example for my life I want to express from my heart brother that I've been able to see God through your life that's what's impacted my life I want to focus on on on the theme on what God has given you you've always focused on a very important thing that is priceless on and that is going for that lost soul that's what I've seen impacted my heart that you left everything to go for that one soul to find her you've left so many things you prove with me through your life you got up at 23 in the morning just to go for that Soul how many Souls aren't there here in the church that are witnesses are testimonies where there been a man God sent in the of God us showed us on this Earth so that we can do what he has done just don't want to give you a flower R but a bouquet of roses you that right in your life was impacted me you go where God sent you for that soul that needs you and the only thing you do is show the life of God now look brother this is what creation this is what creation of God that's what the scripture says Romans 8 for the earnest expectation of the of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the Son of God now creation Brothers creation waiting they were waiting they were waiting for the Manifest stand for God that's what they were waiting for for like you brother give everything for God that don't think twice to not go for those Souls yes yes brother creation allation all the Earth was waiting for that moment for that life that was going to walk was going to give life to this earth that would give a purpose to this earth that would give eternal life amen amen Brothers the same creation was waiting for you for the how many children of God are here how many of God here are here yes Brothers I finish with [Music] thiss we would see Jesus he says I believe the church nowadays when I say a church I'm not speaking of a certain denomination I'm not speaking of all General churches together there's just one church family for 50 years asked me to join the family why I was born AB I was born in the family that's the reason why how do we get into the church we are born into the church by one Spirit brought into the of God and we are made partakers of his grace of his glory and within us there is eternal life we born in church the family God has given us and this is the pastor this is our spiritual father [Music] will God bless you brother Tito amen uh Luke 1227 you don't have to look for it the first first words say this consider the lies how they grow Song of Solomon as the Lily among the [Applause] thorns before the Lily give it its Radiance and its Aroma I want you to notice the Lord wants us to pay attention not so much in the beauty because but the Lily is beautiful focus on the process of its growth not so much on its beauty that's why it's saying I want you to observe To Be watchful how the lies are how they grow because the Lily has a growth process the Lily is not like the mushroom night and in the they die the following day the mushroom doesn't last very long it lasts very little but the Lily endures longer because the Lily goes through a process is born in the valley in the mud they grow in the most horrible places says goes into the the go to the dark the dark places listen opened way among the darkness of the earth I want you to see the Lily it opens way in the darkness of the Earth from the depths of the Earth from the depths of the earth it brings forth life that Botanical life is a natural type spiritual as well it brings forth that life from the earth the depth of the Earth brother says what does it do to glorify himself to glorify everything that is in contact with him you know brother Bram when he speaks of the Lily preached many messages that he he he he he titled it it says that the the person that's closest to is the I want to make you come into contact with that Lily have beneficiaries of those depths Brothers the comes down to the depth getting closer the L does that the goes down and brings forth the life brother Branham says says look the Lily it comes from way down in the brother doesn't matter the circumstances or what's going on around Pastor matter what happened around him what happens around us whoever the Son of God the daughter of God what's happening around thank God for that brother Bram says and every minute of the day listen it has to be drawing from the earth see what does it do with this virtue that it draws hallelujah hallelujah it gives it out brothers that in this morning who would be those lies who would be like those they don't think about themselves don't they think about others pastor of this our pastor that he hasn't cared about a whole lot he given his life for this m g his life for each one of us and he's drawing from the life not from the Earth but from the depths of God that's where all life comes from it continues saying it makes a beautiful sight for the admirer it opens up itself for the for honey have we Ben been beneficiaries of that from our pastor God bless our pastor may he give you more may help him that matter he just opens himself up gives himself God bless you could you give an appla Applause to our Lord Jesus Christ very strong Brothers Tito now brother Tito now to brother Tito [Applause] you may be seated I'm so happy and grateful with God because he is good with us he is so good with us I've always believed or thought and said that if some if we are something and if if if we have something good because of the love and grace of God it's because of him because the Bible says nothing good is in man that has not been given from God every good gift every perfect gift descends from above from the father of light Grace only brothers so I'm so I'm so grateful with God and thank brother I want to thank brother thank you for being our pastor thank you for telling the Lord yes because you know one thing God has chosen us we have had to make a decision as well it's not that just God has chosing to serve the Lord as well and our brother has done that he has done it hasn't been easy because it's not easy but it has been worth it it's been worth it the decision you made it's been worth it has done throughout years through you has been worth it brother Tito it's been worth it my desire is that God always bless that's my desire that when he accepted the pastor position if I'm not mistaken he was 25 years old I believe more less 25 years old but it's been worth it been worth it to tell the Lord yes the Lord has Vindicated him because he vindicates his own he vindicates his own the Lord vindicates soon later he will vindicate them and we've been able to see that God has Vindicated him my desire is that God would bless you I was about 28 years old more or less my wife well I've gotten

[Applause] [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] fore amen for for for for [Applause] amen [Applause] we've gotten to the last part of the service I was thinking about a few words to say to our [Music] pastor and I I saw where he was born in Salas I looked in various places but God said no you won't say anything the one that will say it will be brother Garcia so we have some words forcia for our [Music] pastor right now I'm refering to the young but right now I'm refering to the young they have to take care of themselves so then they can then take care of their family so then if time did ter I believe it's possible we may be here a few more number of years and the young people will be the future minister future teachers evangelists pastors Apostles so forth they have to take care of and they have to get ready to prepare themselves so that when that day comes that there's a better job that you can fulfill that job Titus 17 this preaching he preached it in 1984 it's been almost 40 years for all of you that know our pastor he knows he we know he doesn't like to be the center of Attraction even this service was not was not going to be undertaken just so you know the kind of Pastor you have but Hebrews 13:7 says says remember uh your your pastors which have rule over you who spoken unto you the word of God whose uh Faith follow considering the end of their conversation so remembering our pastor and maybe probably that many of us could not agree in many things but I believe we're in agreeance in one thing that we love our pastor how many love your pastor amen [Applause] amen and because we love him we want to give him a small gift the whole church got together we all uh got into one Accord and we want to give him something Pastor coulde please come [Applause] forward [Applause] graas herto thank you brother Tito for all of your work and your hours your tears we love [Music] you and we are very thankful with God for you that you are our pastor if the children could come from all the church we uh and the chap fold the brothers Froman are are missing here we want to give you this this gift on behalf of the church in God I I wanted to uh just break free from this God bless you you may be seated if your desire was to encourage me I believe you have achieved it amen gracias gracias [Applause] graas you guys commit [Music] me truly I don't I didn't believe it was a good idea to make one of these services for me for you that know me you know I don't like it I I feel uncomfortable I like to do more for others than for myself it brings me more joy to do something for somebody else then you have then you do it for me but I believe that all of the pastors and all of the Servants of God we need a little bit of encouragement we need someone to tell us it's it's worth it what you are doing yes thank you Brothers thank you for those those Praises for the words that the ministers gave for the videos for thinking about me I don't deserve it I believe that all glory should always be to God like our brother Edward said many times you have to say yes to God many times we have to say it's that's it's fine Lord since I can remember I've been serving the lord and I remember remember the reason the voice of two Tabernacle was was born was because I spent two years weeping to the Lord saying Lord what is it you want me to do it were years when I didn't know what to do and I remember praying to God saying Lord what is it would have me to do he said to to to move to Watsonville and help my father I still spent I still spent one year trying to to convince myself that it wasn't God's will but he kept telling me that's what he wanted and I moved to a little garage the services were taken were took place in a garage sometimes I would just preach to my brothers but I've always done it with all my heart brother Edward came brother Willam brother Marsh there was various people of not I'm going to get into problems I don't mention brother Miguel everybody when they began to arrive so after I moved God told me to begin Voice of Truth Tabernacle it was just simply the our family there and he told me to establish the church lay down a good foundation I registered it normally people pay thousands to register Church through a lawyer and God helped me to do everything that needed to be done to legalize Voice of Truth Tabernacle when it was just two three four people and God told me to do it right what you do do it right churches and groups they don't even know what happens with the offerings there's no regist begin from the beginning he told me to do right that enters the registers that there would be a system everything would be done right and and that is the the theme of of my life is that if you're going to do it do it right if you're GNA preach even if there two or three on the bench do it right prepare yourself give the best of yourself and that's what I've done for those you that have been there in that garage it was my father's s's [Music] house I would always tell them the group it's not how many we are it doesn't have anything to do with how many there is Let's Be Happy let's love God and that the Holy Ghost would be amongst us that's what matters the quantity has never mattered to me I don't see an ed advantage in quantities I seen Advantage when we love each other with our heart because I believe that since I come from a broken such a broken family there's always been a desire in my heart to have a true family and God gave it to me God fulfills his promises um one time we have R rented a small place there in Watsonville now I always had to do the harder thing put up the projector play the guitar and then song Lead preach and sometimes we had Gatherings if if if it's something we had even if it's just a little bit that people like to come visit us so I was going to have a small guest I don't remember who was going to visit us and I was complaining a little bit to the Lord I feel tired it seems like nobody helps This truly what you want me to do or what is it and God said when I tell you God told me God told me I don't say God told me just to say it God told me what if I called you for this just simply to work and like I've always done God always defeats me I said that's fine Lord if this is what I'm going to do this is what I'm going to do as long as it's what you want when he told me to move from California that was very difficult but God showed us he gave us he gave us some great signs and I still remember when the truck of quite a few families was full the biggest truck I could get from Pensky I had never driven such a a big vehicle I was so scared to drive that thing um but I remember seeing those that we were dismissed from that day I didn't know who was going to move I just knew that that's what God had asked me to do my heart was weeping said Lord I'm gonna have to move again I don't know if I'm going to see them again I don't know if I'm going to see them again and the Lord told me I'm going to give you all the ones that came to your ministry and he was faithful many times my life I've had to make decisions that I don't understand them but I know when God tells me something and I've tried as best I could to be obedient just be obedient even though I don't understand and the reason I'm obedient it's because he's always been faithful because I believe him I believe in a mighty God the last talk I had with California when I from California I I told them if I see you again or or not just know that I've believed in God that I believe that I believe that there's a real God just know that there is a real God I believe in that God I didn't know what God had in the next 40 years I believe 40 years is very significant we're not celebrating brother Tito at least that's the way I see it we're celebrating what God has done I believe God has done a lot and he can do a lot when somebody surrenders to him somebody is simply obedient um come years where I just simply want to relax simply just say well Lord but the random says that or the story of the eag where where times come where the wings get a little tired your eyes begin begin to fail you the beak doesn't grab hold of the food right and there's been moments where I felt that way you know I Was preparing for the my 40th year year I felt something in my heart to prepare for it because I've seen that the number 40 is very significant in the Bible 4 days 40 nights 40 years 80 years Moses etc etc so in on this trip to Colombia I decided to spend as much time as I could with God because it's different here you're always dealing with the situations sometimes you go out and like oh I need to fill my cup again I need you to help me I was telling the brother I'm not going to go eat the youth had activities I would go to my room I I I wept a lot in prayer I said Lord I I believe I need to make another decision like the eagle make another decision what will I do with what is left because after after I wept I went to the mirror I looked at myself I said are you gonna do it are you gonna make the right decision I said yes Lord you're all I have you're the greatest thing I have I want to serve you for the rest of my life I want to give the best of myself I want to give more for you because I believe that I'm not the only one that's broken here I believe we need one another I've never wanted to do it alone I've always wanted a family to do it with me the Walk of a pastor gets very lonely unless you're a pastor there's a lot of things you won't understand that sometimes you have to take many blows or hits for others it seems like you have to be willing to or things but that they would tell you that you're this or that um and then have nobody to share your pain with but we have one [Music] another I don't desire to be alone I desire to do this with you I desire to make it to eternity together so my desire is to do the best for you I believe that if we are willing for God we will loose more of God we will loosen more of God's power we will see more of God's wonders we serve an almighty God and if there's somebody that stands for him he will stand for God will stand for them if we stand for God God will stand for us if if as bad as we have been God has blessed us so much he has blessed us so much how much more if we stand more for him let's stand for him Church let's stand for one another if you want to stand up for God stand up for your brother anybody can do it anybody could be a Christian alone it takes a true son or daughter of God sinful people people that have errors people that fail [Music] daily say God if this is your people I'm gonna stand for them so let's stand for God and God will stand for us on Friday I said my birthday I said I feel like a blessed man not because I have materialistic things because I truly don't have a whole lot I have more debt than anything don't have cars to boast about house or this or that but I feel a blessed man first of all because I have him because I have an almighty God that humbled himself so much that he was willing to be my friend and walk with me with someone like me that's why I feel blessed I feel blessed because of you you make me feel like a blessed man that's what makes me a blessed man and thank you for showing me your love for your words sisters the youth the song leaders thank you for reminding me once again why we came to this earth why God brought me and he brought me to serve his children and to serve him so thank you Brothers I I tell you these [Applause] things

a teamwork that's the only way like they say alone you can go quickly but together we will go further and that's how we have achieved it because God has placed not that desire not only in me but in Sons and Daughters of God that have stood in this place may God bless you and may God continue blessing this church and and continue to give us more love for one another another that's our desire if a if there's something that makes a father happy it's to see that the children are loving each other and helping each other yes or yes Brothers it's not the gifts yeah gifts are nice but if a father makes something some it makes if there's something that makes a father happy it's that the children would love one another if there's something that makes me happy it's to see a church that loves and
