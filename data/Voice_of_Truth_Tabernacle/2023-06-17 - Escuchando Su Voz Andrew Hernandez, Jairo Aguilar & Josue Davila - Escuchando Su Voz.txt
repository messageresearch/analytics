[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Melly [Music] [Music] foreign happy to be here in the house of the Lord and it's been a while since I haven't been in this poulton yet he brought me here now if you can please open our your Bibles this is a book of First Kings and verses 8 to 9. you say in amen so like you know you have it okay and the word of the Lord says like this is and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to seraphat which belongeth to zidon levantage behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee hey there is Lord Jesus by the celestial thank you for giving us an opportunity to be here thank you for for all the things you did for us I ask you now Lord that you may help us in this night yes through your holy spirit will help us be attempted from our ears in our eyes may you help us may you help us to leave here blessed Lord we know then we're not worthy to be in this pulpits the Lord you know all things and you alone are worthy so help us help our and my brothers the brothers who will Who will preach Lord yeah I ask you in your precious name amen amen okay as you all know we are now in the point you may be seated as you all know we are now in the character a new Bible character is [Music] Elijah Elias amen amen and you know who Elijah is instead is he was you know a mighty Prophet um who did many who did many miracles for God and he's actually one of the most complex characters in the old testamentos then his name means the Lord is my God so nombre significa El Senor is medios and amen amen during during the time you know his name you know means a lot to us especially in his time his position you know he was a propheta and you know what a prophet is one who is sent and called called and sinned by God to speak his word to his people Pueblo but you know he was also human era um just like you and me yo hmm yes amen when I think of Elijah I think he was more like a prophet who was perfect but he wasn't really Perfecto he was just like you and me compared to a brother William Brennan comparado hermano William Branham both were prophets who had a Ministry that was very mysterious that only God would reveal his hidden plan to them sometimes sometimes God works in mysterious ways he can sometimes understand and he did that with Elijah yellow is and so with brother Branham iwalkon hermano Branham his when we speak of Elijah you know when he first appears his origin you know he is not much said about him you know his beginning you know starts off you know just when he's about to deliver his message other than he was of the have inhabitants of Gilead or a Tish bite I think and I thought to myself then that if it was a coincidence that God will leave you know his beginning out of it or was it intentional or foreign God you know would just leave it like that ASI I believe it was intentional intentional because sometimes God doesn't always tell other people where they come from and we don't need to tell random we don't need to know where we're coming from because God knew how he was going to use him you know the beginning and he lived in Israel during the Ring of king agap and queen Jezebel and Israel who brought idolatry into Israel Israel and brought dark times in the land in that time you know it was you know a dark those were dark days during where Elijah lived and you know who King a have been Queen Jessica Ahab was a king you know a Jew by by birth but Jezebel wasn't she was a gentile and she was you know the cause for bringing you know idolatry in Israel turn the hearts of God's people from him and it was at that time that God brought Elijah and when he comes you know Elijah was known for a dramatic demonstrations and speeches and and we know we know it from when he speaks to to Ahab you know it wasn't really pretty nermoso and throughout his life he gave all those mostly to to the king and the and the Queen and he also performed many miracles muchos Milagros you know when I'm raising a kid Savage and multiplying The Jug and calling down fire from heaven we mostly don't see a lot of Miracles but we know that God does do miracles in our lives and you and I we are that Miracles amen amen he is sometimes described as Harry either he had lots of hair or had a camel tunic o yes and it's kind of funny yes yes during that time Tiempo because we don't see a lot of profits you know many prophets as being hairy having lots of hair or having a caval tunic especially especially when you think of brother Branham but I won't get any to that stuff really but the point but what Elijah did have like brother Branham he had a fiery personality that Fiera and he had a strong passion for doing God's will look videos he was very zealous for putting you know God first because many of times we are like that and brother Branham was also like that and you know he had strength forced us he was a wise and faithful Prophet Savio he will made wise decisions and he was faithful to to God and he was not afraid to speak truth to the king sometimes the truth is what what all we need to speak I mean someone doesn't want to hear it but he also had weaknesses he can you know as I said he wasn't perfect he tended to complain a lot how many of us use sometimes complaining yes amen amen and he was he was a lonera muy solo he made you know he was mostly alone during his life sometimes we're all also by ourselves and he also fled in fear to the Wilderness who won it who wanted to take his life how many youth are afraid when someone wants to take your life it's kind of shocking yeah but I think many of us can relate to Elijah We complain and we're mostly lonely and many of us are afraid of something but there's one thing that sometimes got my attention after his victory the victory on Mount Carmel Victorious Elijah Carmelo Elijah fled to the Wilderness yes Jupiter tree and in Albert and enable after the juniper tree he went to mount where God appeared to Moses here is Elijah you know just fleeing from Jezebel again and finding refuge in a juniper tree that's sometimes where we sometimes go you know our refuge yeah Elijah you know he he was so depressed that God asks that he asked God to take his life there is right yes sir yes sir but you and you know how the story goes an angel came and met him him and then he went to Mount Horeb 110 were the same place that God talked to Moses and Ms he was now go he now went to this mountain I have here in the message what here is thou Elijah escuchas Elias preached in 15 in the year of 1959 you can put it up and he called to him and there went the rushing wind through that tore up the mountain Tim amen I'm sorry to keep you waiting but bear with me brothers and Youth foreign the Rocks ran and fell down Elijah's just said said and listened and there came a shaking an earthquake that shook the mountains but Elijah's just said still and then come the fire fellow Fuego lightning flashed and Elijah's set still and then a still Small Voice spoke and Elijah answers he wrapped his mantle over his face and walked down I just wondered that if we haven't listened too much to rush rushing Mighty winds and Fire and Blood and everything else is and have failed to hear that still Small Voice I wonder if we looked so much to gifts that we can't see the givers you know America is prone to noise that's the reason rock and roll is so popular and all these things these other lots of noises now we've had rushing Mighty winds we had great shakings but where has God been in all of it yo Elijah said he was not in it what did we do with rushing windsos what have we what have we done with all kinds of Sensations my time is Almost Up Guys Brothers but you can look it up if when when this is all over yes didn't read the entire message but my point is that the devil can bring us some voices and noises of fear Diablo depression entertainment and distractions of the world [Music] that keep to keep us from hearing God's voice but if we just just be still and see that God is in the sounds of rushing wins earthquakes and fire and Thunders itrenos then we Christians can really hear that still Small Voice amen youth amen that is how Elijah found rest reassurance in God's voice and so can we if we let ourselves be still and seek what God can do in our lives here in I got one in the in the first chapter you know for in the chapter of First Kings 9 19 the 19th Chapter and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his mantle in his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave is yeah and behold there came a voice onto him and said what do is thou hear Elijah says that's how the Widow at seraphat happened to her before Elijah came to her yes Tim is and she like Elijah heard that still Small Voice and God from God and let her be used by him for his purpose is that's all I have to say is this Pulpit to our brothers [Applause] God bless you God bless her brother Andrew Congress tonight sometimes and when God comes to speak I mean it's something simple and it's night with titled is listening to his voice that is our theme our title for what we're talking about and again thanks to stand behind here hey I always forget to give thanks to read the scripture First Kings 17. verse one we'll be reading tonight if when you have it you can please say Amen Christo let's read this in the Lord Jesus Christ who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab um as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor Reign these years but according to my word and the word of the Lord came unto him saying is getting hands and turn the Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook Chariot that is before Jordan that is before Jordan Thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there is so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord for he went and drove by the Brook Charis that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook you may be seated the title is listening to his voice I like to base myself off on the first scriptures where it says has the Lord God of Israel lived yesterday we believe that we're in his presence we believe that in that time there was a scarce of his words they wouldn't listen to his voice I mean Elijah was in his presence before coming to the king foreign foreign and thus saith the Lord amen we see that that Elijah was in in his presence I want to read a little bits now we're going to typify that to spiritual drought today right now we all recognize and we are in agreement that there is a great spirit today nowadays did you know that by the prophecy was said to come before the the Second Great coming of the Lord there will be a hunger on the land and it wouldn't be hungry only from food or from bread or hunger from hearing the word of God that day he is here today here the the word I mean the true word that's just like I told you in the beginning sometimes and God is simple I mean Elijah had a himself didn't provide himself this place throughout this time of the droughts that his food was provided day by day necessity he did not need to worry about what was going to happen tomorrow God had told them I have ordained the Ravens and they will feed you what a marvelous thing is the type of secret place that we have in Lord in the Jesus Christ when the word was presented to him or to them did it why because they got far from it is this is also what the people had during the Days of Elijah and departed from the word they believe they have the word and they truly didn't have it let us know that the time that God was going to punish the unbelievers he provided a way out for the believer the saying that it is the same as as always if God brings judgment he has also brought Mercy I mean he has revealed his plan of Escape as well as for Moses doesn't matter what may come if God has told you that he will fulfilled word he is he has not changed today and forever El Senor is where we're coming for the coming of the Lord amen there is going to be a drought we believe that now many say okay the summer waiting on God amen yes God bless you [Applause] God bless you Brothers greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ of the word of God along with my brother Andrew and my brother Jairo before beginning we give you thanks for allowing us to hear your word Lord thank you Lord because you're giving us this opportunity let's take advantage of it now I ask you Lord we'll be able to finish the service according to your will the numbers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ man amen amen we're speaking on Elijah the propheta Elias the Prophet Elijah Elias is the most important characters of the Bible is how the spirit of Elijah was used by spirit ISTA in John the Baptist foreign stage will present the Gentile bride you will present a gentile Brothers um and I want to read a scripture enl ivro de Amos in the book Amos 3-7 they say it says sure the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret once again I'm going to read it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets 14. [Music] it says like this foreign [Music] [Music] how he spoke of her being a woman that painted herself you know Como is and just as in those times age of History God sent them a Prophet The Prophet Elijah brother William Branham in the adequate time the exact time when the word was the people needed of God the Widow receive the prophet is she heard his voice how God works yeah see and in that way we also hear that through a prophet not just any kind of profitable that was tried and it was God speaking through man the true the message in the messenger son Uno they are one Elias Elijah sent out his message it won't rain until I say it will another [Music] said God however it might be he brings us the word she didn't have a husband she had no more food left it was just her and her child and they waited for death but in the in the opponents when they needed someone God sent a prophet God sent a prophet is but the prophet doesn't come just he always comes to bring something to bring his word man I want to read a quote of brother Branham this is further Brandon says the message God's way that's been made she goes in speaking Yeah she takes these two sticks and break things way of breaking the stick brother Brown says that was a cross of course yes La Cruz and in the cross they burn it right in the middle Fuego because that's where the fireworks burned then they brought the whole cake and give it to the preachers do you believe that yes sir man amen I give thanks to God foreign once again I remember I was born in a Christian home I was born in the message in Peru I
