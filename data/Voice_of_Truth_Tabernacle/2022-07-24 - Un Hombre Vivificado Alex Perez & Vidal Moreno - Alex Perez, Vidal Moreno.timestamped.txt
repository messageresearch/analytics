[21:44] [Applause]
[21:45] [Music]
[22:12] lord for allowing us to be here one more
[22:14] time
[22:18] and the trust that is bestowed on us
[22:22] and this morning
[22:32] we'll be speaking with the title a
[22:34] quickened man
[22:36] hombre bibifical a quickened man
[22:42] we're still speaking on restoring the
[22:44] family
[22:45] you know
[22:48] and now we're focusing on the man
[22:50] me objectivo and los proximos minutos
[23:02] [Music]
[23:18] and finish off today
[23:32] first corinthians 15 45 is
[23:46] and so it is written the first man adam
[23:49] was made a living soul the last adam was
[23:51] made a quickening spirit
[23:55] lord is blessing you may be seated
[23:58] says
[24:15] and our brain and our outlets we're
[24:17] blocked
[24:19] we're clogged continuous
[24:22] brother branham keeps saying
[24:29] al punto
[24:43] says the faith has been clogged up with
[24:45] business affair it it's all become so
[24:48] clogged up with all that god
[24:50] with that until god can't operate
[24:53] through the those channels
[24:57] oh brother saying he got
[25:29] [Music]
[25:53] he lost the spoken word
[26:22] to speak
[26:35] so our wives
[26:48] let me remind you that adam
[27:18] we see
[27:30] then adam went to his wife
[28:06] because when we're speaking of the line
[28:08] or the headship headship of god
[28:13] we see how god
[28:28] these qualities
[28:36] because god's life is zoe
[28:39] manifesto
[28:40] god manifested in adam repito la vida
[28:55] made him a god
[29:13] of descending of the structure that god
[29:15] has placed
[29:17] because we think
[29:19] it is
[29:20] patronus
[29:22] just because
[29:51] what does zoe mean
[29:55] god's own life
[30:04] for passed from death unto life
[30:20] man
[30:50] he was told since the beginning if he
[30:52] ever ate of that tree he would die
[30:56] not many people say death but he didn't
[30:58] die
[31:00] let me tell you he lost eternal life
[31:13] he didn't have everlasting life
[31:30] shall all be made alive
[31:35] so the channel of life
[31:38] was broken
[31:42] as soon as adam decides to sin el canal
[31:44] de la
[32:11] remember the life is
[32:54] so let's return number one
[32:57] adam had
[32:58] eternal life
[33:02] and the woman comes from adam
[33:06] and when they say
[33:49] he decided before the foundation of the
[33:50] world
[34:14] [Music]
[34:30] [Music]
[34:30] [Applause]
[34:32] is
[34:56] returns back into your blood cell and
[34:58] gives you the same life la misma
[35:20] in greek words go look it up and the
[35:21] greek word eternal means they come
[35:24] from the word zoe
[35:28] life of god himself
[35:32] and if jesus through his death enter
[35:36] their own life
[35:56] because god
[36:38] without
[37:31] foreign
[37:39] [Applause]
[38:00] so the bible says
[38:07] but i would have you know that the head
[38:09] of every man is christ
[38:16] and the head of the woman is the man
[38:20] and the head of christ is god
[38:25] patron father they're structured
[38:28] the head of christ christ
[38:44] that's how the blood flows stings
[38:46] without blood there's no life
[38:50] let me tell you
[38:52] this is
[38:53] the spiritual the spiritual iglesia
[38:56] mismatch the church by itself does not
[38:58] have life
[39:00] [Music]
[39:25] through the right channels
[39:39] the sister is missing her husband
[39:43] so what's next
[39:46] if the man is missing there's chris
[39:50] christ means the anointing
[39:53] there's an anointing in this church
[40:08] cause my attention
[40:22] the simple fact that is faith
[40:28] covers those sons
[40:32] the blood is tremendous
[40:36] when i understand this
[41:04] are
[41:05] [Music]
[41:18] designed to bring us life
[41:22] to bring that life running in the blood
[41:26] are you with me
[41:29] juan diaz binti says john 10 26 yeah
[41:34] i like what it says
[41:46] but i want you to take this it's
[41:48] important
[41:50] to be understanding these things
[41:55] repeat with me the man i have a leader
[41:58] we have a leader
[42:00] leader we have
[42:42] john 10 26.
[42:46] i love him
[42:49] grace but you believe not
[42:53] jesus jesus says you don't believe me
[42:56] because
[43:24] he sets an example of a good shepherd
[43:28] green and he says you don't believe me
[43:32] this morning how many do you believe
[43:35] do you really believe
[43:37] because if you believe
[44:48] right
[44:51] now i say for myself
[44:53] i hear him
[44:54] but i don't hear him
[44:57] because i'm not believing what he's
[44:58] talking about
[44:59] that's our mistake
[45:20] jesus says the shepherd jesus says i
[45:22] give them eternal life
[45:26] is that my own revelation
[45:30] but i see how the
[46:11] transmitted to me
[46:41] i need a baby
[46:42] or the woman
[46:45] obey my husband
[46:47] that's the way the line runs dios gaar
[46:51] christo christ
[46:53] the man
[47:22] and i want there
[47:46] god bless you
[47:49] [Applause]
[47:55] god bless everyone
[47:57] if you would just open your bibles up to
[47:59] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1.
[48:27] and you hath he quickened
[48:30] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[48:43] remember our title is the
[48:45] quickening power
[48:56] matthew 8 22 reads like this
[49:00] but jesus said unto him
[49:02] follow me
[49:04] and let the dead bury the dead jesus
[49:10] amen
[49:11] man
[49:13] you know when we look into the bible
[49:17] and uh you know i was just kind of
[49:18] looking up uh the definition of what it
[49:20] is to be uh quickened
[49:24] significant
[49:26] and uh you know some of the terms that
[49:28] come up some of the synonyms that come
[49:29] up
[49:32] it's uh to stimulate
[49:36] to excite
[49:37] emotional uh to stir up
[49:40] revolution
[49:42] to aroused
[49:44] uh to awaken
[49:47] uh to activate activar uh to um inspire
[49:51] inspire uh to refresh refresh uh to
[49:55] strengthen
[50:10] is to have a life by este nervida amen a
[50:14] man that's that's what brother branham
[50:15] says
[50:17] and you know speaking on the importance
[50:19] of a man
[50:22] you know especially in the home
[50:24] especially
[50:37] and uh you know
[50:39] that's that's basically you know how how
[50:41] it ends up being that way
[50:46] you know because uh if if the devil
[50:48] wants to take somebody out in the home
[51:01] uh you know that's that's why the homes
[51:03] fall apart
[51:06] because the man is supposed to be the
[51:07] strong ones
[51:10] he's supposed to be firm
[51:12] he's supposed to tend to stand true
[51:16] uh you know first of all to god
[51:19] i like what brother tito says
[51:33] you know that's that's his first
[51:35] colleague
[51:38] a lot of men they get upset
[51:42] perhaps you know when the women goes to
[51:44] the pastor
[51:47] well she wouldn't be going to the pastor
[51:48] if you did your job
[51:53] you know and that's the truth yes
[51:55] you know it goes from here back to that
[51:57] way
[51:59] you know if if uh
[52:01] that's just the way it is
[52:04] but when we talk about about quickening
[52:09] to be a quickens
[52:11] uh we have to understand
[52:14] that you know when the fall came
[52:29] he couldn't quicken himself i know
[52:57] [Music]
[53:01] you know there was something else he was
[53:03] lacking
[53:05] and they could only come from one person
[53:11] he's telling his
[53:12] disciples he says follow me
[53:16] man and let the dead bury the dead
[53:19] you see what he says
[53:22] he's letting him know hello
[53:24] that if you go do these other things
[53:39] he was the only one
[53:42] oh that could bring you life
[53:45] that could help you quickly
[53:48] that could help you quicken other people
[53:53] that's the truth yes
[54:07] the best way to do it
[54:35] if you want to inspire someone
[54:49] [Music]
[54:50] he says now when a man is inspired
[54:54] and he reads the inspired words
[54:59] since the two inspirations together
[55:01] gives a result amazing
[55:03] juntas produced
[55:19] queisteres mismo saint speeding it says
[55:21] it takes your inspiration
[55:25] with uh the word is already inspired
[55:30] what we need today
[56:41] oh good mark oh not way out no more no
[56:45] way at that that's not something that
[56:46] they will never forget
[56:50] oh you follow jesus
[56:52] that's what he was telling us
[56:55] that you want to quicken
[57:10] a lot of times
[57:20] you know they like to consider
[57:21] themselves you know christians
[57:24] christianity because they go to church
[57:26] why not like you know they sit on the
[57:28] pews
[57:30] and you'll never know that they were
[57:32] really there
[57:35] that's what he says
[57:37] he says because they've
[58:05] and that's the truth yes
[58:46] is
[58:56] [Music]
[59:45] moses
[59:48] he picked up that dry stick el record
[59:52] and that stick wasn't nothing unless
[59:53] moses picked it up

[1:00:42] alone
[1:00:46] it's dead es muertos but there's nothing
[1:00:48] to it
[1:00:50] uh if it's alone

[1:02:18] this
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:32] let me know
[1:02:46] as it may sound eastern
[1:02:49] i believed it
[1:02:51] i believed it
[1:02:57] but unfortunately
[1:03:00] you see we're always
[1:03:29] another
[1:03:30] it just it doesn't have life in it it's
[1:03:32] implemented either i wonder you know if
[1:03:34] that's not the case in many churches
[1:03:39] just a body yeah solo equipped with

[1:04:12] taste this food can you push somebody
[1:04:14] down

[1:05:05] through the time of poverty
[1:05:09] it don't matter no importa that don't
[1:05:11] matter because you're quickened
[1:05:14] and you're alive
[1:05:16] and you may not have a whole lot
[1:05:18] of mucho oh but if you have jesus
[1:05:47] you just have words of inspiration
[1:06:44] dr davis

[1:06:57] brother brandon was like man he's going
[1:06:58] to let me know how great of a job
[1:07:04] and you know i bet he went in there

[1:08:34] he says
[1:08:49] yes
[1:09:41] paul in the book of first corinthians
[1:09:42] chapter 16. paulo and primarily
[1:09:47] he tells the corinthians this is

[1:14:59] believe that jesus himself
[1:15:02] i believe that he went through a time of
[1:15:04] discouragement
