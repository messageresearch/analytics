foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] one body one flesh and this evening and this morning I want to ask who will I ask Ed [Music] to give up this young lady to be the wife of this man amazing failure foreign everything one momentum the moment has come for our brother Roger so let go of his daughter everyone may take their seats looking towards each other yeah the most contentos we're happy it's a wedding yes wedding is special every wedding is unique every couple is unique every relationship is different and in every wedding normally I like to ask the group a little bit of the history and why they decided to get married to get married with that person in particular Christina uh when I asked her what did you decide to marry Isaac she said he is my true best friend and I feel stronger together with him I believe it was all God's plan how our lives unfolded and how we grew as an individual S I believe God knew what I needed and he placed Isaac in my life for as a friend it is that comes and support one another in anything that comes [Music] anything else in this life you know that this is God forgive me because I know all of this is putting us together like a puzzle piece okay I come to realize God wants that marriage Persona simply be better people not all marriages and the problem is we get lazy and we don't do the job that has to be done the first thing I grabbed from the scripture is that they do it together in other words not only one side is getting sharpened up and the other one is not but both are doing it sharpens one another in other words they sharpen one another and I believe that's what happened in their relationships both grew up being together it wasn't just one person it was just one-sided well the whole problem was you no see no que loss but they said both of us need help I believe that in relation to work out well they have to do it together because both of them need help in a relationship it should be done together if you're going to help one another both are going to grow even if it was one person that made the mistake or one person that's struggling even more Persona the other one also has to change and put on their behalf to be of help so the person that needs it in that moment many times you want to change someone think without first changing ourselves that has the problem but here we see in the relationship of brother Isaac and her sister Christina is that both helps one another to be better but leave that relationship are all about has to be of help to make one better and one doesn't like to do exercise maybe the other person motivates them maybe the other person wants to eat whatever they want maybe the other person teaches them how to be a little healthier maybe one likes to leave their clothes all around the floor he both help one another when one of them likes to spend all the money and the other one likes to save one helps the others and both are willing to be better all right that's what's happened in this relationships both were in difficult situations and when they found one another say are you that on the helpful they gave each other their hands and they both came to be even sharper it wasn't just a one-sided thing how beautiful it is when you do things together now that's Point number one now Point number two is to help one another many times you want to attack something that Isaac said here foreign to update and I like that because I believe okay that's a problem with many of us actually we're un-updated it should be updated constantly and it says we get used to one another Persona we can stop to stop thinking about doing something else for the other person without energy without creativity is we just simply know he's my husband and we haven't come to realize years actually and we have to update ourselves because my husband is my wife is changing because what was of yesterday isn't of today that's how I felt yesterday it doesn't mean I feel the same way today maybe today I'm struggling we have stated in a past uh version and we don't realize that we could be of more help we could be better we stay mediocre nosed I'm a good wife we don't realize that we could be even better if we would update ourselves a knife that is not sharpened completely it's now fully fulfilling its purpose to know that these young people this couple has done and that they continue doing it continue sharpening one another keep on obtaining it continue learning of something new of one another know each other more there's always something more and always do it together and all so we're happy now we're going to continue on to the vows matrimony says neither one should go in this without accounting more lightly and in the fear of God in this holy State these two two people present come to be joined and if there and be anyone here they can show or just cause speak now or here on now keep your silence there's no one continuing glory god we can continue hold up this is I'll demand of you and make both of you responsible surely you shall give accounts on the day of judgments in all man's secret shall be revealed if one of you not being united lawfully confess it now be sure of this is United together outside of what God allows your marriage is not legal but believing you have considered this solemnly obligation and that you have prepared to enter a premises soberly and in the fear of God as you join your right hands together go ahead and we're going to ask him to our brother Isaac first acceptance do you Isaac Arellano accept this this bride Christina to be your lawfully wedded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love her honor her and cherish her and support her in sickness or in health riches or poverty and unite only to her as long as you both live and she is [Music] yeah he accepts very well [Applause] we're going to ask Our Sister Christina will you accept uh this gentleman to be your lovely wedded husband to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love him and honor him and cherish him support him in sickness and riches in poverty and will forsake all others only unite to him as long as you both live I do again very well we're happy now we're going to ask for some signs special gift for them some necklaces made especially for them and yeah thank you okay thank you very much Guillermo now our brother Guillermo here are some coins that have been given Hermanos for our brothers exactly here to our brother Isaac our brother Isis gonna take out the coins and give them to us or something Christina as a symbolo as a symbol Forest that

very beautiful now it all depends on this Bible their whole lives depend on this Bible and their whole marriage depends on this Bible so it's very again they're both promising yes it's going to be the center of their marriage but they're never going to depart from the word to the right next side I always stay 100 with it to come up with the Rings the Rings a symbol of Eternity a sign of a covenant
