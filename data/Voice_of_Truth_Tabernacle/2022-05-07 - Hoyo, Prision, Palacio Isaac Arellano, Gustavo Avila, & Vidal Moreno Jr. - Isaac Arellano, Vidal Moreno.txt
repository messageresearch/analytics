and said lord help me please i got up shouting singing the victory victory is mine and victory is high and victory today is mine and i told you to get the behind cause victory today it is [Applause] all the holy ghost is mine the holy ghost is nigh the holy ghost today is fine and i told satan to get behind the holy ghost is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] god [Music] amen praise the lord now

neither to have my pastor interpreted so i thank the lord and my pastor for the opportunity so just as you are standing let's enter into the scripture and it will be in genesis chapter 50 verse 20. if you can say amen when you have it into english our title is pit prison palace the scripture says like this everybody has it but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive celestial thank you for one more day of service it's an opportunity that we can prove ourselves to you and lord as the word is being spoken may there be ears i receive the word lord and there be hearts that can sow this word lord corazon and lord may you be with my brother fidel and brother vidal yes and our interpreters as well we put the service in your hands amen amen you may be cedar brothers hermanos now joseph's story brethren la historia de jose begins in chapter 37 of genesis so the end of the book of genesis so that's a lot of chapters that it takes up now joseph's story of jose begins with a dream amen maybe some of our stories historias maybe also begin with a dream but then he faces a lot of disappointments in life that actually got to live out their dreams he had his dream and he saw it fulfilled amen but there's something different so joseph was the son of jacob and i just want us to understand the family structure and his uh son of israel lies actually in syria and great grandson of abraham is that clear so joseph is a teenager he was married to two sisters and then they both offer their concubines to jacob to have more children because at a certain point they were both infertile right and that's good jace joseph was a favorite child born favorite child born from the so we see how the favoritism is coming down right and everybody knew it and you see in most ways but kids can smell a mile away can you imagine is isaac here is that kisak imagine rico brother let's get personal here enrico got a cell phone before you did uh if i was you i would be angry right maybe they favored him more you know or these things can keep happening brothers but make it personal to yourself and in genesis 37 it says verse 4 and when his brethren saw their father love him more than all of his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him where no one could speak a nice thing about you maybe you grew up in a home full of criticism and negativity negativity and harsh angry can anyone identify with that you know now here's what happened joseph had a dream about being exalted and esteemed even more than he already is amen josette sueno yes remember the sheaves that were inclining to his and you think that he'd have sense you said and now joseph comes and says want to hear about my dreams [Applause] can you identify with that and imagine his brother saying sure joseph we just want to hear about your dreams of course i want to hear your dreams but imagine joseph he's a little clueless don't you think but fast forwarding they want to kill joseph because he tell them he's going to rule one day but then they decide to sell him into slavery and they take the coats they strip it from him and dip it in goat's blood and they show their father and jacob assumes joseph's dead so at age 17 joseph is taken to a foreign country sold to one of the egyptian officials and now after all the betrayal of his brother and abuse let's read genesis 39 2. just the first parts and the lord was with joseph estaba jose and wherever the lord's presence is the lord's blessings amen that's why he says he was a prosperous man prospero now suddenly the invisible upper story of god is intersects with the turn of events in the lower story where joseph finds himself and in some mysterious way god makes himself known to joseph jose and this is important listen prime your faith a little bit in ancient days the gods of ancient uh pagan places or pagan deities los dioses paganos they were associated with particular places the god of canaan the god of moab or the god of the philistines but the god of abraham isaac and jacob the lord was with joseph jose it's like the lord has been with you amen amen the god of abraham brethren wants now potiphar recognizes this godly president's joseph jose joseph has leadership administration and management skills and it didn't take long for him to put him in charge of his house and joseph is completely trusted joseph just when you think things are going to take a turn for the better for joseph's life it takes a little housewife turn solamente now we know that i'm a spot potiphar yeah who was and joseph's her new target now jose blanco now oh then real quick here when jesus went to receive the holy ghost he got sent to the wilderness and we say brother brandon we know says christ jesus is the type of joseph amen jesus and now he is tempted here but look how remarkably he answers how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god [Applause] or even be and the key word of the story of abraham what is abraham known for the question so faith has to do with abraham right but faithfulness has to do with joseph jose abraham shows us faith and now his grandson shows how to be faithful now listen what happens to too many of us when disappointment comes we allow disappointments and i'm closing now if my brother can get ready disobedience well god didn't fulfill his promise or what he told me over there this isn't how the dream is supposed to go and because god let me down i'm gonna do what i wanted so how will we respond but i'm going to steal an ace from my brother vidal [Applause] okay now i know that this works god i said it's good to be here right i don't know if you guys captured what brother isaac just said our god is not a territorial god he has no limitations certain people have certain gods where he stays with our parents or with our brothers and sisters but we truly never take them further than that hey man god bless you again amen you always bendiga it's good to be here es bueno estado you're awake prison palace this if we can go please is from the troubles they lost problems that's when you start to reveal yourself so something different in you then that's when all hell breaks loose genesis verse 23 and it came to pass when joshua was was come unto his brethren pit kilo now the pit was empty perro estaba i want you guys to know that was empty estaba and then the the beautiful part pero lo hermosodes hearing how dysfunctional our family he says it in the message the statue [Music] they were all good um [Applause] going to our brother isaac well parents have certain favorites i've heard that ben said to me here here and there um and uh-huh that's very hard yes it's but then going back to the story joseph jose there was something special inside of it was special parents could see please disconnect for the miracles and the works and the gifts that we have same thing with joseph [Music] because that takes us back to the very beginning take the [Music] was cast into que josefo echado was where joseph's hell started because all of this happened right after the gift despised an act of anger act of jealousy how many get angry here juan said i i'm the first one you may say brother fidel you're very quiet but it's when we get closer to god oh hell brexit let me tell you this the devil doesn't care el diablo if you start to think was making his thoughts into actions bearing fruit of what he had inside of him and let me take you here ruben his brother suermano wanted to do good el cariano we could say was the most angriest out of all the youngest brothers get everything that he wants he says in genesis 32 verse 22. had lo que el tenia that made him different from the rest of his brothers and not only his brothers he was made and put amongst other slaves in the house of potiphar but people can notice when there's something la gente puede see it right away but it wants uh to put something in joseph's hands now youth i want you to connect right many times we may think that we're nothing but the world can notice when there's something those influences of the world try to bring you in not jose is that moment of pressure depression or peer pressure try something new why are you like that why can't you be like the others because joseph [Applause] him one time and again and again after day and it came to the past and she spoke to him oh yeah uh [Applause] but what our god has made over material material that will sail down trial get one that gonna break bear any trials the devil is going to do anything diablo to say it amen why there's a lot there and joseph jose and the devil yeah diablo try to burn it out and many times he tries to burn out god [Applause] god bless everyone uh like brother gustavo saying gustavo and brother isaac you know joseph was a dreamer jose and uh the devil sure did try to burn it out you know and probably be the most the most heated moment of a young man's life yeah the the young man uh that's exactly what the devil tried to do it's an exact you know this was a very uh being a young man uh this is a very uh a very trying time in their lives that their dreams are going to be uh are are going to be uh achieved in church i think that their dreams are going to become a reality a young that he believed that god can work [Applause] amen amen i like that it appeared palestinia like joseph's dreams jose his dream it looked like it became a nightmare i didn't know that it was supposed to be like this is that's really up those drinks they won't be able to burn them up oh because i got something can't be burnt up i got the holy ghost meal and god gave this to me he's yours melody and you can't take it away amen amen i like that you know when joseph gets into this home to the penthouse a la casa del foso the pinch house oh penthouse pint yeah yeah la casa de los galandes yeah it's it's a really nice place so he you know i imagine joseph the devil always tries to give you something prematurely he's always trying to give you something ahead of time he he doesn't want you to work for it say that again he doesn't want you to work for it he he's always trying to give you something easy you know something that you don't have to work for but you know when you don't work for something you just give it a little bit of time and you'll find out it's worse it doesn't take a whole lot to find out that that what doesn't take very long to achieve it's not worth a whole lot mucho valor oh you know and and this woman yesterday a polish pop ponafore's wife you see what she tries to do you know that's what she tried to do is she didn't get what she wanted oh so she throws this this huge tantrum that affects you see she she didn't get her away and you know an ineffective joseph yes jose hey man amen she didn't succeed because we understand that in the heat of the moment you know and i hear the moment you know that that that it was greater than the lust of the flesh but there was something in the soul of joseph jose that was burning even more it was bait was burning even brighter and it doesn't because everybody maybe they're like oh i see there was something about that guy you know will take care he didn't you see god knows what you're going through when he sees that joseph's not tripping yeah he that he didn't skip a beat jose you are the atlantean elsie you're coming out that's just how just how god wants us to watch imagine he didn't even put up a fight he went straight to prison he was like say that again he was like if this is where god wants me el dijo a slang they were from god and they're yours this bible this message that's inside it's from god i don't care who says whatever i can look at each other i don't believe it that's fine but i'm the god she probably challenged joseph's manhood at the time he gives you the if hell didn't work then i'm gonna freeze them out i'm gonna freeze them out i wonder if i wonder how many haven't gone through the moment for the moment through a cold spell donde estam frios you're just cold implemented sound free you know when things get cold they get a little difficult because things start freezing up they freeze up second you can't clap your hands no more you know you can't do a whole lot of things when because your mind just froze when you're not seeing forgiveness [Applause] jose wherever he went wherever he was i want to let you know that this was the key question this was the key of joseph's life so when you have something that is proven something has been tested you went through this world wherever they continue his service was first to god jesus christ served sinners and because when something it was the chains that were trying to hold them back it was the devil's power that's what was fading much further [Music] much more than than just preaching behind the poopy es mucho mas que solo predicated i want to let you know i didn't understand that you know you know for the longest time and you know i i underestimated right appreciate it i i you could say i despised just speak god gave it to me he gave me my name and you know when i uh when god gave me some revelation i found out what my name meant you know what how i love my name i love my name me nombre [Music] i want to give god everything i have and he takes him a place [Music] [Music] it preserves [Music] god bless you [Music] i'm going to ask you to stand i believe god is here i believe god has spoken to us ah this is not just one
