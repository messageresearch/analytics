[41:33] with the pillar of fire
[41:41] that man had his vision
[41:44] and
[41:46] it was his vision
[41:48] but

[42:17] Pablo Paul
[42:19] with great Ambitions
[42:23] people with great purpose have great
[42:25] ambitions

[42:32] ambition to do more for God
[42:41] to find my purpose of my vision
[42:51] to do so
[42:54] foreign
[43:26] Celestia
[43:31] is you know what brothers
[43:39] Paul had his own vision and then he
[43:41] found a great purpose and a vision in
[43:43] himself
[43:45] and then here in chapter 26 he says
[43:56] not many people will follow
[44:00] few of those that follow a man with a
[44:02] vision
[44:04] yes because everyone's our own Vision
[44:15] but he knows why he's standing up
[44:44] for something
[44:55] are you with me this morning
[45:00] Paul is a great vision foreign

[47:45] running Brothers

[48:02] be and what to do your responsibility my
[48:05] responsibility is to do so with all my

[52:12] of God to be fulfilled and this morning

[52:54] God bless you close vandega if you would
[52:57] uh send greetings to the brothers
[53:01] um
[53:02] let's go to Isaiah 53 verse 10. it's
[53:04] messy and I say yes
[53:06] it's a very familiar verse
[53:09] [Music]
[53:12] I always uh wondered what exactly it
[53:15] meant
[53:18] you know it's the Lord's been good yes
[53:24] that says like this
[53:27] Isaiah 53 10 is
[53:30] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him
[53:33] he had put him to grief
[53:36] when thou shalt make his soul and
[53:37] offering for sin
[53:39] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[53:41] his days
[53:42] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[53:44] prosper in his hand controllers
[54:00] The Book of John yes
[54:02] gospel John chapter 9 verse
[54:08] the words of Jesus
[54:11] Jesus you know when he was fulfilling
[54:14] his purpose here on Earth
[54:18] he says this he says I must work the
[54:21] words of him that sent me this day
[54:34] amen amen the power of a vision
[54:38] you know when we read you know Isaiah 53
[54:41] 10.
[54:43] you know it talks about how the Lord you
[54:45] know how it pleases the Lord to bruise
[54:47] he's talking about Jesus Jesus
[54:51] you know when we read that
[54:55] you think that God is some kind of
[54:57] masochist
[54:58] foreign
[56:11] but just be able to do you know as as
[56:14] the Lord led him
[56:16] amen amen you know and I just start
[56:19] reflecting on this
[56:21] mess I always like to uh reflect on on
[56:24] my personal walk
[56:27] you know I I look back into my childhood
[56:30] days
[56:32] oh you know and just always I've always
[56:34] been that that person that always asks
[56:36] why
[56:39] you know and I'd like to do it when I'm
[56:41] alone
[56:43] you know because I believe that that's
[56:45] when the Lord speaks to me the most
[56:47] oh you know when it's just you and him
[56:51] if you don't do it uh yeah I I just want
[56:55] you to I encourage you
[56:57] you know there's no there's no other
[56:59] Fellowship like the one you have with
[57:01] the Lord
[57:03] you know and you know just talking about
[57:06] his unique walks
[57:09] you know I believe every single one of
[57:11] us here
[57:13] is
[57:16] because you are unique
[57:18] oh there's nobody else like you on the
[57:21] face of this Earth
[57:25] he's like there's nobody else on the
[57:27] face
[57:29] that can do what you can do
[57:34] it's the truth
[57:35] it may not be something great to you
[57:39] may not be able to do what the pastor
[57:41] does
[57:43] but I'll guarantee
[57:45] there's something in here
[57:50] because he was not sent to do this
[57:56] it was yours
[57:58] he didn't have to maybe go through the
[58:00] pain you went through
[58:03] because that was not for him
[58:05] it was for you foreign
[58:16] [Music]
[59:57] you don't appreciate
[1:00:53] because
[1:00:57] there's something inside
[1:01:57] foreign oh so God chooses
[1:02:01] he chooses you in your walk
[1:02:04] ain't the things that you went through
[1:02:07] because there's something special about
[1:02:09] you especially oh you know I was sitting
[1:02:12] there thinking
[1:02:13] you know you were out there in the world
[1:02:15] foreign
[1:02:32] and the hell you are going through it
[1:02:39] because
[1:02:47] you couldn't stay in the world
[1:02:50] because there was something foreign
[1:03:15] a lot of times we're scared to talk
[1:03:17] about it
[1:03:19] we're scared to talk about it how about
[1:03:23] there's people that need here
[1:03:30] he brought you out of the abuse
[1:03:33] he brought you out of hell
[1:03:36] who brought you out of the world
[1:03:40] because there was something great inside
[1:03:42] of you Hallelujah
[1:03:45] greatness Grandesa
[1:03:59] a lot of times we just have a very
[1:04:02] shallow thinking
[1:04:05] um
[1:04:09] amen amen
[1:04:11] brother Brandon says this is
[1:04:15] ambition

[1:10:31] so you can you can't bring them but you
[1:10:33] know
[1:10:35] together

[1:10:40] the other one down
[1:10:44] yes one of us

[1:10:52] because that's what an ox does
[1:10:55] somebody that works
[1:11:03] you know that a lot of times you know
[1:11:06] instead of working up to being an ox
[1:11:09] you know a lot of times we just like to
[1:12:09] move forward
[1:12:28] I don't feel like doing this I don't
[1:12:32] want to do that
[1:12:34] nobody has here by force
[1:12:36] you have a choice
[1:12:43] that's right
[1:12:45] you know he's going to keep pulling so
[1:12:48] either you're gonna pull with us
[1:12:59] for your purpose
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:13] we gotta work man
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:20] yes sir
[1:13:22] see
[1:13:25] in the message images of Christ the
[1:13:27] worst his greatest desire
[1:13:29] he said
[1:13:30] I said save your souls for Christ
[1:13:33] Christo
[1:13:37] uh
[1:13:39] second to last
[1:13:43] it's all the way down bro
[1:13:45] Hallelujah
[1:13:48] says this the C he says
[1:13:51] the only thing that at my highest
[1:13:52] ambition and only ambition my mind is to
[1:13:55] see Jesus Christ glorified
[1:14:02] I live for that song
[1:14:08] Our Testimony that 31 years is in the
[1:14:11] making now I have humbly served him yes
[1:14:22] if I should live a million years
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:25] I had that much like to live
[1:14:28] I'd want to live every minute of it for
[1:14:30] him
[1:14:32] and if I knew I'd be turned down at the
[1:14:34] end
[1:14:37] it's such a privilege to live for him
[1:14:45] I have never found nothing in all the
[1:14:47] travels of Life
[1:14:51] compare with the fellowship that we have
[1:14:53] together when we're alone
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:01] it's greater than the love for anything
[1:15:06] children
[1:15:09] is the love of Christ
[1:15:14] you know
[1:15:15] in closing now
[1:15:18] I sit there and look
[1:15:21] I look around I look at the people I
[1:15:25] look at the youths and I see so much
[1:15:28] potential
[1:15:30] potential I see so much
[1:15:32] there's so much more we can do
[1:15:37] but nobody can do it for you
[1:15:39] nobody can make you
[1:15:42] do something you don't want to do
[1:15:45] I don't serve a God that's gonna Force
[1:15:48] anybody he won't Force you know the sad
[1:15:52] thing is
[1:15:53] that you know this passion that he had
[1:15:57] a passion and that's what was his fuel
[1:16:01] yes
[1:16:07] he had something to fueled him
[1:16:15] and I believe
[1:16:18] that you're so unique
[1:16:20] that you're so different
[1:16:23] because in that way
[1:16:26] you are like him
[1:16:30] nobody's ever walked how you walked out
[1:16:32] nobody is gone exactly what you've gone
[1:16:35] through
[1:16:36] and he's looking for those people
[1:16:41] that have that kind of testimony
[1:16:44] of uniqueness
[1:17:08] for God
[1:17:18] even if it's just one I don't care Una
[1:17:22] let it be just that one the heck is
[1:17:26] but I'll guarantee you
[1:17:29] when you get to the Gates of Heaven
[1:17:33] you just had that one testimony
[1:17:38] if that's all you had
[1:17:42] that's all you needed
[1:17:43] that's all you needed to use
[1:17:48] the sad thing is
[1:17:50] that you have a life
[1:17:53] you have a life
[1:17:55] and it's it's you know God God bought it
[1:17:59] he paid the price
[1:18:04] El president
[1:18:06] it's just so sad a lot of times
[1:18:09] did other people care more okay
[1:18:13] about your life
[1:18:19] the doctor cares more about your health
[1:18:21] doctor is
[1:18:25] that you yourself
[1:18:30] other people care more about your
[1:18:31] purpose
[1:18:38] it's the truth and we don't realize it
[1:18:42] but there's no discipline but there's no
[1:18:45] discipline you know why there's no
[1:18:47] discipline or because there's no passion
[1:18:50] you know because if there was
[1:18:54] difference
[1:18:56] nobody would get in your way
[1:19:00] nothing could get your way
[1:19:04] you would you would run right through it
[1:19:07] that's right you'd run right through it
[1:19:10] if somebody had passion it was Peter
[1:19:14] Pedro he was a man with passions
[1:19:17] but there was another one that had more
[1:19:19] passion
[1:19:21] he steps in Jesus's way Jesus
[1:19:26] you wanted to stop Jesus
[1:19:31] and Jesus is like get my get behind me
[1:19:33] Satan Jesus
[1:20:35] to be able to do something
[1:20:38] but you hold yourself back from doing it
[1:20:43] that's what he had
[1:20:45] he could have pulled out the swords
[1:20:48] at any moments he could have spoke the
[1:20:51] world but he was on the ground
[1:20:57] because he had control control
[1:21:02] and that's what we need yes
[1:21:12] regardless of what the world says
[1:21:15] regardless of the criticism
[1:21:24] why does he go over there
[1:21:26] why does he do this but why does he do
[1:21:30] that
[1:21:31] the reason he doesn't
[1:21:35] it's because he's doing all he can
[1:21:39] and the only difference is
[1:21:42] he's willing to do
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:22:41] about the great things God has done
[1:22:45] the things that God has given you
