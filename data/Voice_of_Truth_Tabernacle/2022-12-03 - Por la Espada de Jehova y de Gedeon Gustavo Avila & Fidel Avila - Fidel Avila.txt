recognize that there's no one else like you to God like my God it has many other s that claim to have a mighty God but I have a God that it pleased him to manifest themselves but also in the church my God is manifesting himself in this day still is and I believe that's what makes my God so great yes that he pleases him to use something so small so insignificant stand is amen amen can you stay do you believe you're one of them one of those called by God Amen foreign the sword of the Lord and of Gideon that's very key to our message tonight is we were picked to share this word with you tonight if you can go to judges I'll give you a little more explanation of this beautiful title amen and the three companies blew the trumpets and break the pictures and held the lamps in their left hands and the troubles to the right hands to blow with all and they cried the sword of the Lord and of Gideon escuadrones amen one more time the sword of the Lord knowing that I have nothing to offer so that may not glorify myself as a service without you God is in vain this moment right now that we're having with you God is but I believe that my brothers and sisters bring a portion of you in them and according to your word where two or three are gathered in your name is so applying Faith to that word is believe in that it is being manifested right now we thank you that you're here with us you take control of me and my brother and of The Interpreter Lord you place ourselves in your holy hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated now the sword of the Lord and of Gideon now now when I was reading this word it made me it amazes me how important it was to God to say and sell the poder tell the people to say make sure this is what you shout because they could have said the the sword of the Lord only but he made sure that it said they also said it comes to tell me how much God is loves to share with his children he wants them to taste in Victory he wants them to know how it feels to know victory Gideon needed a little bit of that victory in his life so in his life can be changed around many of the times God wants us you have just a little taste of that Victory whatever it is you're going through must have a taste of that Victory I never ever want to look back to your past life cause you're in glory now you're in a place the devil can't touch your addictions your doubts whatever it is but God wants you to be part of that he's always worked in that pattern to that's what makes this Bible that's what makes this Bible his word to me so awesome but again now bringing this to our Lives Many Times Yes we are called but many times we come with many things we know that God accepts us the way we are yes but he doesn't want to keep us the same way our Prophet tells us that the holy spirit is always moving forward and we also have to move forward the only way we can move forward letting go of the Lord and whatever that is to you you have to identify yourself in the world the preachers bring it to you for you yourself have to make it personally and take it with you in your heart and Supply it to your life because that's the only way that the word can be make a fact foreign can just have a little taste of that Victory there is a Victoria the help Gideon push them on um the Great and Mighty conqueror to every man before you can do a job you have to have some motives some alternative something that you are working on for a working purpose something to work by our beloved Pastor over there in Phoenix he preached over there about how can I overcome and and he did these three questions who will overcome how will we overcome why do we need to overcome now I believe I'm one of those two needs to overcome amen [Music] not having a good why why do you want to stay in the same life that you're in foreign but you need a good route and I believe Gideon had a good wife because I and Gideon can relate to one another say in our past life how miserable we were living because remember now and my brother said it last week what type of Life Gideon was was living he was always expecting failure to come into his life would always come and take his food and he was always ready for them being a coward and the same thing with us the Devil comes and knocks us around and then he splits us out to the corner and we continue on our lazy daily lives in church but we were called for something else do you believe that you recall for something greater we don't promise something greater we must promise we will reveal the greater lives but it's needed of that faith that step of Faith they say they say they say or not even a great step of Faith but simply a desire pero a little hope doesn't overthink it doesn't think too much about it he just simply has a good why and ask you do you want a good white tonight do you want to have a reason why you want to step out of the life you're living in that's the questions I have to ask myself that's what God is always asking me foreign but again we need to let go of ourselves the prophet says and the message the Great Mighty conqueror everything in his kingdom must be for him Todo Para surreino it must be your heart for Him there can be nothing against him anything that was against him he would have to dismiss it he must have absolutely everything for him and we go back to the story of Gideon going down to 32 000 to 3 000. Hombres refining them down uh refining them down to have a certain quality of people around Gideon to help them on to obtain the victory because when God calls a man he now when he calls them he commissions them also and when he commissions them then he stands unfortunate and then he does the same thing with us he doesn't only call us out of the world to save us and then let us be lost again he gives you the weapons the tools whatever you want it's up to you [Applause] something inside of them stirring in their hearts over something else God knew who he was calling he predestinated for before the foundation of the world that God is still wanting to use someone like me today he wants to bring out a Gideon he wants to bring out a Samsung he wants to bring out a roof he wanted to bring out all these great characteristics out of us but at the end of the day preach after preacher can come break their back lose their voice hey Brothers gracias all of that won't matter if there's a cold heart a heart heart a close mind unamente thinking the same thing time and time again I have another chance you may say I have another chance end of the year is coming by yeah I'll write a piece of paper and put in an envelope do the same thing time and time again it's needed but it's necessarily of a change and it's only up to you yes it's a personal walk yes personal I'm not bringing nothing new I'm just simply bringing what has been preached to us and I pray that tonight you you have a good wife after tonight foreign God bless everyone have a good why of being here a good reason for being here how many are happy for the Lord how many are in love with the Lord right now we should be more happy Sunday a wedding is going to take place this evening on Fridays we're talking about the Bible characters we're talking about the judges the focus now is Gideon replaced by the sword of God by the sword of the Lord and Gideon because it um I thought a little bit about the people of Israel and sometimes I think about a circle the people of Israel lived in a very much of uh what is a circle when the people left Egypt and they went to the Wilderness they lived in a circle of Israel on the time it was almost the same thing they were still living in a circle if you can put it up there yeah it's a drawing but it is I have it in a group of circles first you have it up front a front is the comfort zone when everything's okay with the person I mean I really don't need a guy right Brothers they say okay everything's okay I didn't get coveted nothing hurts I'm strong I don't need of God and in the following Circle that's where the midianites came all of the brothers intramos they found themselves as well found themselves Supreme in the days of the judges every man had his own absolute each man was acting correctly in his view now do you know the reason that they did that in judges this might surprise but the reason they did so in judge was because in those days they didn't have a prophet to whom the world alone the absolute DSM look um something something that I like brothers uh and judges and the three squadrons blew the trumpets and breaking the jugs they took the Torches in their left hand okay the people of Israel began to conquerque uh when Gideon was going to conquer the scripture says here that they began to play the trumpets and something that I like very much is that he says by the by the sword of the Lord and of Gideon this is and they start each one as post around the camp dios God dios God wants us to overcome God doesn't want us to not overcome God wants us to be Overcomers the problem doesn't lie in God the problem lies within us or when we don't do what he tells us that's why we can't overcome this is he gave us three points how we can overcome and who's going to overcome in Revelations 12 it says like this and they have overcome through the blood of the Lamb OS Nosotros we are there [Music] but sometimes Brothers we're not going to overcome by our own strength that's what we have to make clear to ourselves sometimes we want to help ourselves sometimes we want to do things and it's okay but it's God it's the blood of the land helps us to overcome how can we overcome in these last days look brother the way in which we can overcome is through this message gives us the keys we're able to overcome in these last days I believe to get out of this place it's giving us the keys amen why is it necessary that we overcome amen why Brothers why do we have to overcome you know why I'm going to tell you what our pastor says here I believe that we're living in a time when we know how to overcome that's what our Pastor said I believe what the prophet of God says he says a man completely surrendered to God om omnipotente becomes a powerful a powerful omnipotentes so there's the answer who did that he was a character that he couldn't overcome by your own strength and there was Gideon is waiting on God and look brothers and look Brothers was hearing that's behind all things amen amen amen they say um so then there's the answer on how to overcome there's a the answer bro we have to come to the moment where we surrender ourselves because we don't want to surrender ourselves much less to a man completely to the Holy Spirit he says it won't be you overcoming but God overcoming through you know we know we have to surrender ourselves but why don't we do it we know that we need the Holy Spirit but why don't we seek it you know this evening I see God everywhere anything we're gonna see everything with love to be able to overcome with the Holy Spirit the problem is don't go and seek him I'm not going to be an overcomer that way we come to church and we need to come in action my name is more burden than anything sometimes we come thinking about other things the majority of things that you're thinking about in this moment they're not worth it because the most important is your salvation our pastor says like this I feel like we're living in a time where we say or let someone else is someone else let someone else surrender I'm going to continue with what is mine do it [Music] our pastor says uh he says the problem with that is that if you don't overcome you will be defeated if you do not overcome your fear look Brothers if we don't overcome right now right now whatever you didn't even have to overcome his own fears he's always taking care of everything Lord hallelujah if we don't overcome it Brothers if we don't overcome today all of that it's going to catch up to you and it's going to defeat yeah you'll have to overcome it today today look Brothers please stand look I'm a Barber Brothers and I am in contact with many people unhappy people that don't know him people that don't know where they're going peace they think that just for a moment of pleasure that they're going to be okay but today Brothers I wanna make sure that I'm gonna be with him imagine I'm I'm in church for more than 20 years and for me not to make it that all my life I'd be deceived in church that's how Gideon was [Music] in church Gideon was in church but he was scared [Music] and that's how many of us are but I believe today you don't have to do much brothers all you have to do is open up your heart to him I did it that way brother Reuben Contra Perdido when I found myself lost I said Lord come into my heart and there's sometimes I don't feel it [Music] but it's not about feeling it feeling him it's not about you feeling everything but it's about believing it about believing it doesn't it doesn't
