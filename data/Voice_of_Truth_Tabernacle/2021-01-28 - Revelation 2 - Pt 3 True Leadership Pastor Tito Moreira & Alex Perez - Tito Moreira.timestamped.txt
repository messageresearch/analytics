[25:51] that's
[25:51] right we're we're starting uh we're
[25:54] talking about the beginnings the
[25:56] beginnings of the church
[26:00] and we want a good foundation in our
[26:03] lives how many want a good foundation in
[26:06] their
[26:07] lives the Bible
[26:10] says
[26:12] edify or build on on the
[26:15] foundation the
[26:16] apostles and the prophets yes that's
[26:19] other verse I have there Ephesians
[26:24] 220 and are built upon the foundations
[26:26] of the Apostles and Prophets
[26:29] I want you to to
[26:31] uh understand if you want to have a good
[26:34] foundation uh you
[26:36] need to know who you're following that's
[26:39] [Applause]
[26:41] right we are all following someone all
[26:45] of
[26:46] us even if you're not following brother
[26:50] Tito or or brother
[26:52] brand
[26:55] brother we're all following
[27:00] somebody there are some that are
[27:02] following their
[27:06] wives it's the truth
[27:13] Brothers there are some that are
[27:15] following the the most the one that Goss
[27:17] the most in the
[27:21] church there are some that are following
[27:23] their own
[27:26] thoughts
[27:30] and all of that will take you to a a
[27:31] wrong
[27:33] Foundation God
[27:37] needs for you to follow the right
[27:40] person if there's going to be a right
[27:43] foundation there has to be a right
[27:48] leadership and God established in this
[27:50] first church in this first
[27:53] age in this first
[27:55] group he established apostles
[27:58] isn't that
[27:59] right they weren't the
[28:02] best the most
[28:04] religious or the most the most holy they
[28:08] were Sinners
[28:10] right
[28:12] Peter
[28:14] Matthew
[28:20] andn jaob he called them the sons of
[28:23] thunder because they were
[28:26] tremendous to call fire down from heaven
[28:28] to kill the
[28:31] people they they were very very angry
[28:34] people but God chose of the
[28:38] worst and made us go
[28:42] through through the fire of the Holy
[28:45] Ghost so that he could transform
[28:49] them and so that that that could
[28:52] demonstrate the power of the Holy
[28:56] Ghost and the true leadership of the
[28:58] Holy
[29:00] Ghost and God tells this
[29:04] age I need you to know who you are
[29:08] following I need you to know who your
[29:10] leader
[29:11] is I ask you this
[29:14] question do you know who you're
[29:16] following or do you do as you
[29:20] please that's why we are how we
[29:23] are God
[29:25] begins in the greeting
[29:28] first verse in the
[29:30] greeting put the
[29:34] greeting God lets him
[29:39] know that he is the beginning from the
[29:42] of that he is the same in the beginning
[29:43] of the churches all the way to the
[29:46] end in every
[29:48] church he is the
[29:50] same in other
[29:53] words he has the same
[29:55] power in his right hand of his brother
[29:59] of his right
[30:00] hand in every
[30:04] age that's why it says the one that
[30:07] holded the Seven Stars in his right hand
[30:09] the the Seven
[30:10] Stars the Seven Stars
[30:13] Brothers he speaking of the seven
[30:16] Messengers the leader of the
[30:20] age comes with the same power of
[30:23] God in every
[30:26] age same in the first
[30:28] agage all the way to the last
[30:32] AG just how the church
[30:35] began with the Servants of God
[30:39] serving as these
[30:42] Apostles how they serve the
[30:45] people that's how he would be in every
[30:50] age and they set the
[30:53] example these Messengers set the example
[30:57] so that we would
[30:59] know what type of leaders to follow are
[31:02] you with
[31:04] me so all this whole
[31:07] age has to do with
[31:10] leadership and what type of leaders God
[31:14] wants that's why when God inaugurated
[31:17] the church he tells
[31:21] them this is the way the leaders will be
[31:23] in this in the
[31:25] Kingdom they will serve the brother
[31:28] they won't be as the
[31:30] others that they try to uh to be to
[31:35] govern or try to
[31:37] control uh the
[31:40] others and that is
[31:42] why God tells this
[31:46] age if you do not
[31:49] repent I will take away your
[31:52] Candlestick I will take your
[31:55] leader that's what brother brandom
[31:58] says I will take your
[32:03] pastor this whole age has to do with
[32:07] leadership who are you
[32:11] following who which are the true
[32:14] leaders that we should be
[32:17] following what is the condescension of
[32:21] God and how should those leaders
[32:26] be ask brother Alex to come
[32:35] forward glory to God how tremendous
[32:41] Brothers I don't know if you got your my
[32:43] notes out
[32:46] back how many are happy to be here this
[32:49] this
[32:50] evening um second slide
[32:56] please
[32:59] it begins
[33:03] saying Revelations chapter 2 verse
[33:07] two it
[33:11] says I Know Thy
[33:16] works and thy labor and thy
[33:23] patience I'd like to read this this
[33:26] quote
[33:28] Jessie lman of of this this person Jess
[33:31] Jesse
[33:37] Layman he he wrote This Book of the the
[33:40] story of of the the church
[33:42] agents and he says uh these
[33:47] words the love of
[33:53] Christ that burned in the hearts of
[33:55] these people
[34:03] would allow them to to show a love to to
[34:06] their fellow
[34:08] disciples a
[34:10] Unity of
[34:14] spirit a joy in the in
[34:18] communion and
[34:20] especially an
[34:25] interest
[34:27] [Music]
[34:30] the members of the
[34:36] church what a tremendous quote of
[34:39] from because this has just told
[34:43] [Music]
[34:46] us that when they received this message
[34:49] of of the first
[34:52] age the love of Christ that burned in
[34:54] their
[34:55] hearts
[34:57] when the word came to
[35:00] them they couldn't do anything
[35:04] else but but but to
[35:07] demonstrate to demonstrate that
[35:10] love because I receive that
[35:13] love we receive that love of
[35:16] God and we don't stay with that
[35:20] love something burned within their
[35:24] hearts so that they would express it
[35:28] because love is
[35:33] expressed one can express the love of
[35:35] God that one has
[35:41] received is to to love our our fellow
[35:44] Brethren that
[35:47] means that the people of
[35:50] Ephesus this first
[35:53] [Music]
[35:55] age when they Lear learned and received
[35:57] the love of
[36:01] God it they automatically began to
[36:05] work automatically began to
[36:09] serve that's why John the the
[36:13] writer God through John
[36:16] writing he he he
[36:20] Praises he says I Know Thy
[36:24] works the works of the Ephesians
[36:29] were works that demonstrated
[36:32] love were works that demonstrated the
[36:36] interest in
[36:42] others what a tremendous Foundation
[36:47] Foundation when the church was
[36:51] founded the the the
[36:54] beginnings the interest
[36:58] of one for the other for one
[37:02] another I
[37:06] ask the same passion would be in each
[37:09] one of
[37:12] us so I Know Thy
[37:15] works and and and and and that th thy
[37:20] Work for for
[37:25] who
[37:27] to build my own
[37:32] kingdom they knew in what kingdom they
[37:35] were working
[37:39] in they knew they had to reflect that
[37:44] love the interest for one
[37:50] another in the book of the the the the
[37:53] exposition of the seven Church
[37:55] ages
[37:57] it says like
[38:01] this don't ever be
[38:04] discouraged saint of
[38:09] God that's what God tells us this
[38:14] evening don't ever be discouraged
[38:18] people I repeat let's not be
[38:21] discouraged because
[38:24] God is does not
[38:29] God does not ungracious to forget your
[38:30] labor of
[38:32] love God is telling us this evening
[38:35] don't become
[38:36] discouraged don't get
[38:39] discouraged God does not
[38:41] forget when you show love towards
[38:44] someone he does not
[38:46] forget when you
[38:49] share the love of God to
[38:53] others because what we do for God
[38:58] and for our Brethren the Bible
[39:02] says how can I say I love my brother if
[39:04] I don't or love God if I don't love my
[39:10] brother the love of God is reflected in
[39:13] in the in the love that I show
[39:15] my the work that I do for
[39:19] God that demonstrates I do something for
[39:22] my brothers that's the only
[39:25] way hand in
[39:29] hand
[39:32] so
[39:48] to whatever we do even giving a cup of
[39:51] water to someone has a reward and
[39:52] blessing from the
[39:55] Lord notice how he he relates
[40:00] this the love of
[40:03] God to to the love reflected to the
[40:06] people yes sir that's
[40:11] right how can we say we love our
[40:16] brothers easy serving our Brethren
[40:19] that's
[40:24] right how can I find out that I that I
[40:28] truly love
[40:30] God when with in my with my
[40:34] actions because there's an
[40:38] action and me giving somebody a glass of
[40:42] water not only am I just am I saying it
[40:46] but I'm expressing it I'm taking
[40:51] action from what is within me yes sir
[40:55] amen
[40:59] I could tell you I I love you
[41:02] all but if I don't demonstrate with
[41:06] deeds in in in in
[41:12] action I I truly would wouldn't love you
[41:14] very
[41:20] much God never forgets what we do
[41:22] Brothers next slide
[41:25] please
[41:28] I want to tell you this
[41:32] evening that what we do for God God
[41:34] never forgets
[41:36] it the Church of of of the
[41:41] Ephesians before they they lost that
[41:44] first
[41:46] love they were a church that was rich in
[41:49] love we said it the previous
[41:52] time you cannot lose something you never
[41:55] had
[41:57] so that they could leave their first
[41:59] love lose their first
[42:01] love because at one point they had that
[42:03] first
[42:07] love so we can find out what that first
[42:09] love
[42:11] was and why they lost
[42:15] it we could tell
[42:18] ourselves I have to Be watchful of
[42:22] these I have to watch
[42:25] that
[42:27] so that we don't fall into that same
[42:30] condition Hebrews 610 says like
[42:48] this
[42:51] okay for God is Not unrighteous to
[42:54] forget your work and labor of love which
[42:57] he have showed toward his name
[43:03] okay we're going to take it slow so we
[43:06] can understand what the Scribe is saying
[43:08] here in the book of of of Hebrews the
[43:11] Apostle
[43:17] [Music]
[43:21] Paul for God is Not unrighteous to
[43:24] forget your work and labor of love
[43:30] which you have showed toward what name
[43:33] the name of
[43:35] God the name of Jesus
[43:39] Christ there's a comma there if if if
[43:42] you
[43:44] notice and that you have
[43:47] ministered to
[43:49] who to
[43:51] who to the
[43:55] Saints and do
[43:57] Minister and do
[44:09] Minister when God
[44:14] sees my labor our
[44:17] labor our
[44:20] work that we're doing it in his
[44:25] name
[44:27] we're doing it for
[44:29] God but the
[44:33] action it's for his
[44:37] name notice what the writer is saying
[44:44] here it say the labor and the work that
[44:46] you have done toward in his name or for
[44:49] his
[44:51] name when we do something for our
[44:53] brothers and and we serve the
[44:54] Saints
[44:58] we're not doing it just for them we're
[44:59] doing it in his name for his
[45:04] name we're doing it for his
[45:09] name sometimes we fall we fall in the
[45:13] the Trap we say I'm not going to help
[45:14] the
[45:16] brother why would I help the
[45:20] brother why do I have to love the
[45:24] brother
[45:29] remember in in who in what
[45:30] representation you we are doing it
[45:35] in because you take credit for for for
[45:38] my Saints for doing something for my
[45:40] Saints you're doing it for
[45:43] me it's as if you're doing it for me sir
[45:46] that's
[45:49] right serving
[45:54] them this is what the first uh church
[46:06] had where's that right right on the side
[46:09] there
[46:10] uh remember without seizing your work of
[46:13] faith and labor of
[46:23] love and patience hope in our Lord Jesus
[46:31] Christ the first
[46:34] church they
[46:38] understood that in serving the
[46:42] Brethren they were serving
[46:46] God that the love that they reflected to
[46:49] toward
[46:50] God was being
[46:52] expressed in serving the Brethren yes
[46:55] sir
[47:02] amen maybe more than I
[47:11] do holding forth the word of
[47:18] life this is that I may
[47:24] rejoice
[47:26] that I may rejoice in the day of
[47:34] Christ that I have not run in
[47:40] vain neither labored in
[47:47] vain did this
[47:54] scripture because how Paul says you
[47:56] could do something in in
[48:01] vain you could work for
[48:05] yourself isn't that
[48:10] right many times we could say oh I'm
[48:13] doing something for God but we're
[48:14] working for our own
[48:16] benefit Paul says that's a a work in
[48:19] vain labor in vain that's right
[48:24] amen we want to build our own kingdom do
[48:29] things for our own
[48:32] benefits the first
[48:34] church with the right
[48:39] mentality but we'll see
[48:42] later that outside leaders uh came
[48:47] in and they had their
[48:51] ownit they had their own objectives and
[48:54] motives
[48:58] they had a work they were
[49:00] doing because we all do
[49:04] something but there are times that we
[49:06] labor in
[49:10] vain we want to work for our own selfish
[49:12] Ambitions or our owning that God would
[49:15] just help us my desire is to work for
[49:19] the kingdom of
[49:21] God serve
[49:23] my not for my own
[49:27] but for the kingdom of
[49:29] God behold the the the kingdom is
[49:32] amongst us next
[49:37] Slide part of Revelations 2:2 says like
[49:51] this says and thou has tried them which
[49:53] say they are Apostles and are not and
[49:55] has found them
[49:58] Liars this comes from the seven Church
[50:03] ages the book it
[50:11] [Music]
[50:19] says sorry brother I I it says a work um
[50:23] means weariness due to to the
[50:28] oppression because the people of God do
[50:32] not
[50:36] work for for
[50:39] him in a in a work of
[50:42] [Music]
[50:44] love but they
[50:49] suffer for him in joy and
[50:52] patience they carry the the the yoke
[50:58] yes I like the the the quote in that
[51:03] book because he basically saying that
[51:05] the people that work for
[51:07] God that work for the
[51:13] Brethren they're not they're
[51:15] not they're doing it happy with patience
[51:21] joyfully you know there's times we can
[51:23] do something for
[51:24] someone say that
[51:27] again and we do it
[51:33] complaining Not only was the word that
[51:35] was saying oh I did something for
[51:37] someone
[51:39] but but but there was there
[51:41] was there was no complain there was a
[51:45] joy there was a
[51:49] revelation
[51:50] something for someone yes sir
[51:54] amen
[51:59] I help the brother I help the sister I'm
[52:02] I'm I'm I'm
[52:03] finished they had a
[52:07] revelation they knew what they were
[52:09] working for that's work of
[52:12] love was through
[52:15] Revelation and they did it
[52:18] joyfully and they took the the patience
[52:21] of that yoke that yoke of
[52:24] patience
[52:27] how tremendous these
[52:30] Ephesians next slide
[52:33] please we're
[52:39] finishing Paul
[52:42] knew that that first revelation was
[52:50] correct God cannot give a first
[52:52] revelation and then a second
[52:54] revelation
[53:00] let's continue there's a lot
[53:03] here in other words he's saying if if
[53:05] God already showed us
[53:07] something let's bring it
[53:10] down when our leader or when we
[53:12] understand
[53:14] something because that first revelation
[53:18] came came from was a revelation to serve
[53:24] others there cannot be another
[53:26] Revelation no no no no
[53:37] no Revelation going going up but
[53:43] revelation we all have to build on on
[53:45] this
[53:48] Foundation we cannot say this Revelation
[53:50] is going to change into another one God
[53:53] does not work in that manner that's what
[53:54] he's saying
[53:56] in the seven churches in this exposition
[53:59] of this
[54:04] book change from from one Revelation to
[54:06] another God does not work like that we
[54:09] have to
[54:10] build from Revelation to
[54:13] Revelation but we will we will build on
[54:16] it in the right
[54:19] manner if we understand one revelation
[54:21] we
[54:22] can't change it for another one
[54:27] very
[54:38] simple if he did that if he did then he
[54:40] would show that he had a change in
[54:46] thought if God in the first age found he
[54:51] he said oh let's
[54:52] [Music]
[54:53] serve love one
[54:58] another God doesn't come and change that
[55:02] Revelation because then God would change
[55:04] his
[55:05] thought say oh we're not in the
[55:07] Ephesians church
[55:09] anymore God requires that for
[55:14] us we continue with that fervent
[55:17] love that we continue serving yes sir
[55:22] amen the Ephesians
[55:25] knew the
[55:30] word as Paul had taught
[55:36] it they knew who their leader
[55:41] was Paul was their
[55:44] leader they had taken that
[55:47] word that
[55:50] Revelation and began to
[55:54] act
[55:56] of from that
[56:01] Revelation I believe God has spoken to
[56:03] us quite a bit behind this
[56:06] Pulpit through our
[56:12] leader and it's our
[56:16] responsibility continue try the best we
[56:21] can because I know it's
[56:23] difficult
[56:25] there are things that Paul would tell
[56:26] the
[56:28] Ephesians and they wouldn't go down so
[56:33] easy but they
[56:35] understood they
[56:37] understood that he was their
[56:42] leader and the moment the leaders is
[56:44] taken off the
[56:46] scene we see the problems that begin to
[56:51] occur church people
[56:53] of
[56:57] that God would not take our
[57:01] Candlestick let's
[57:03] acknowledge that in in in the ephes
[57:06] Ephesians Church
[57:07] age is a
[57:11] leadership and we see the love
[57:14] reflected let's not forget that let's
[57:17] not
[57:18] forget that as people of God we will
[57:22] have
[57:23] fault the Ephesians weren
[57:26] the Ephesians were not perfect the
[57:29] Brethren were not perfect they had their
[57:32] faults his person was different but at
[57:36] the end of the day the foundation
[57:39] was love and serving not
[57:43] mattering not mattering the the rest the
[57:47] rest not
[57:50] mattering when the Candlestick was taken
[57:52] off the
[57:53] scene
[57:55] the problems began to
[58:00] happen do you know how we take the
[58:02] Candlestick
[58:04] off take them
[58:07] away it's not that God's Gonna gonna
[58:10] take
[58:12] them what time
[58:15] said said no no brother
[58:18] I guy here the brother I just
[58:23] moved
[58:25] when we fail to follow
[58:27] leadership you are taking away the
[58:34] Candlestick I don't follow the
[58:35] leadership of the Holy
[58:37] Ghost I am taking away the
[58:40] candles I'm taking what God has has
[58:43] taking away what God has placed and the
[58:46] consequences continue
[58:48] afterward that God would help us that
[58:50] God would help
[58:51] me that I would not take away that I
[58:55] would not take away that
[58:56] guide to follow those
[59:00] steps God bless you
[59:04] [Applause]
[59:13] Brothers I'm gonna put a quote up
[59:17] here from the book um Church ages
[59:23] book if we have
[59:35] it begin to read
[59:50] it go ahead these false prophets are the
[59:53] Grievous wolves that Paul spoke of
[1:00:04] says once I'm gone they will try to come
[1:00:05] and claim equal
[1:00:11] Revelation but their purpose is not to
[1:00:14] help you but destroy
[1:00:17] you so brother brandham is speaking on
[1:00:20] that second
[1:00:22] verse where it says
[1:00:26] and youve tried those that say that they
[1:00:28] are
[1:00:29] Apostles and are
[1:00:32] not and you have found them to be
[1:00:37] Liars God tells us through brother
[1:00:43] random you have to be uh careful who you
[1:00:45] are
[1:00:48] following the Apostle Paul tells the
[1:00:51] Ephesian
[1:00:52] church he tells them
[1:00:55] tells the
[1:00:56] church that that first
[1:00:58] church says after
[1:01:01] me there will be Grievous
[1:01:06] wolves he's speaking about
[1:01:09] preachers about
[1:01:13] leaders people that come that come says
[1:01:16] the Lord Jesus
[1:01:18] Christ dressed as as as
[1:01:21] sheep but are Grievous wolves
[1:01:25] are you with
[1:01:29] me how would we
[1:01:33] know who is a true leader of
[1:01:38] God and who is a grievous
[1:01:41] wolf a grievous
[1:01:47] wolf just worries about filling his own
[1:01:52] stomach he doesn't come to care for the
[1:01:56] BL he doesn't come to to to help the
[1:02:01] Sheep he comes to feed
[1:02:03] himself are you with
[1:02:07] me now I want you to understand
[1:02:12] this because it is a
[1:02:15] key so that you would
[1:02:17] know if you're
[1:02:20] following a true servant of God
[1:02:26] or following someone that's just named
[1:02:29] leader you have to be careful who you're
[1:02:33] following because the person you're
[1:02:36] following will form the
[1:02:39] foundation what Foundation
[1:02:42] brother the teachings that he
[1:02:46] teaches you will build upon those
[1:02:50] teaching seed that he is sewing in you
[1:02:55] in the end they will produce something
[1:02:56] in you are you with me
[1:03:00] Brothers what type of seed are you
[1:03:04] receiving what typ of teachings are you
[1:03:09] receiving if the seat is not
[1:03:13] correct the result will will not be
[1:03:17] right you say Lord why can't I bear any
[1:03:22] fruit why I not gone to the show the
[1:03:26] perfect I live the right kind of
[1:03:30] Life what type of seed are you
[1:03:34] receiving what are they teaching
[1:03:36] you who are you
[1:03:42] following are you with me
[1:03:47] brothers are you are you following
[1:03:49] someone that is placed by the holy
[1:03:52] ghost or somebody that put themselves
[1:03:55] Place
[1:03:58] themselves that's what this age is
[1:04:03] about a true servant of
[1:04:06] God first of all he's a
[1:04:09] servant it's that
[1:04:12] simple he is a servant he is a
[1:04:16] servant a true servant of God is a
[1:04:23] servant he doesn't come to do something
[1:04:25] for
[1:04:27] himself he comes to do something for the
[1:04:29] kingdom of
[1:04:31] God and to serve the
[1:04:34] people that's why brother Alex read that
[1:04:37] [Applause]
[1:04:40] scripture how how how do you
[1:04:44] love and serving the the the Brethren
[1:04:47] the and and help and serving them are
[1:04:50] you with
[1:04:52] me now I want you to notice
[1:04:55] this because in that first
[1:04:58] age two types of leaders rose
[1:05:03] up there were those that God had
[1:05:06] placed that were the TW
[1:05:10] Apostles and then Paul the one that that
[1:05:12] took the
[1:05:14] re and then others rose up that's
[1:05:21] right the ones that heard the other
[1:05:24] other
[1:05:26] ones are the ones that will
[1:05:28] deviate they will not go to the
[1:05:32] world but they will grow alongside other
[1:05:35] Church they will continue to go Church
[1:05:39] continue being
[1:05:41] religious but just simply religious are
[1:05:44] you with me
[1:05:47] Brothers I want you to notice since the
[1:05:50] beginning God
[1:05:52] tells who are you
[1:05:56] who are you
[1:05:59] foll you follow the correct incorrect
[1:06:02] person you will end up
[1:06:08] wrong you have to be
[1:06:12] certain that you are following that God
[1:06:14] that someone God has
[1:06:17] placed someone that is there to Serve
[1:06:19] the
[1:06:21] People brother Bram continues saying
[1:06:27] says these false
[1:06:29] Apostles are the Grievous
[1:06:32] wolves Paul spoke of he
[1:06:36] said once I
[1:06:38] gone they will try to
[1:06:42] come and claim equal
[1:06:44] Revelation but their purpose is not to
[1:06:47] help you but destroy
[1:06:51] you then he reads the scripture
[1:06:55] [Applause]
[1:06:57] for I have not shun to declare unto you
[1:06:59] all the counsel of
[1:07:00] God take heed therefore
[1:07:03] yourselves and to all the
[1:07:06] flock over which the Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost had made you
[1:07:13] overseers to feed the Church of
[1:07:17] God which he has purchased with his own
[1:07:21] blood now these are the instructions
[1:07:24] to the correct
[1:07:26] leaders to the correct
[1:07:28] pastors worry for the
[1:07:31] church for
[1:07:33] the feed
[1:07:36] the the Lord told
[1:07:38] pet feed my sheep take care of them love
[1:07:43] them protect
[1:07:50] them these are the leaders the Holy
[1:07:52] Ghost has placed
[1:07:56] [Applause]
[1:08:00] for says therefore watch and and
[1:08:03] remember I just read that
[1:08:13] paragraph okay it says to feed the
[1:08:15] Church of God which he had P purchased
[1:08:16] with his own
[1:08:17] blood how
[1:08:20] beautiful brother puts it like
[1:08:22] this if you had two drops of
[1:08:26] blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:29] Christ which he he on the cross if you
[1:08:32] could obtain
[1:08:34] them if you could obtain them and had
[1:08:38] them in your
[1:08:39] hands two little drops of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:41] Christ how would you
[1:08:44] walk how would you behave to make
[1:08:49] sure that you would not let them
[1:08:52] fall that something would happen to
[1:08:55] them you would take great care of them
[1:08:58] with all of your soul isn't that
[1:09:00] right how much more he
[1:09:03] says the purchase of his
[1:09:07] blood and now I am
[1:09:12] before the purchase of the blood of the
[1:09:14] Lord
[1:09:15] Jesus you children of God brother my
[1:09:20] sister are the purchase of the
[1:09:24] blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:28] Christ how much more much more more
[1:09:32] Val blood of Lord
[1:09:34] Jesus or the purchase of his
[1:09:38] blood we know it's the purchas he gave
[1:09:42] us to obtain his
[1:09:45] children to buy
[1:09:51] you how should we we uh we treat our
[1:09:58] Brethren brother Bram continues speaking
[1:10:00] on the the Ephesian Church
[1:10:07] age he says for I know this that after
[1:10:09] my departing shall Grievous wolves enter
[1:10:11] in among you not sparing the
[1:10:18] flock also of your own s shall men arise
[1:10:20] speaking perverse things he puts here in
[1:10:24] in the
[1:10:28] commas their own words and
[1:10:32] ideas their own words and ideas not
[1:10:36] God to draw away disciples after
[1:10:40] [Music]
[1:10:42] them that's what the incorrect leaders
[1:10:45] want and that
[1:10:47] Spirit should should come out of
[1:10:50] us because we're all leaders
[1:10:54] we have to be the right leaders am amen
[1:10:57] or
[1:10:59] not the the foolish
[1:11:04] virgin follows the light of the of the
[1:11:06] wise
[1:11:08] virgin and if you have a family you are
[1:11:11] a
[1:11:11] leader have
[1:11:13] children a wife women you're a leader
[1:11:17] right come on
[1:11:20] Church an incorrect leader
[1:11:25] just wants to drag away draw away
[1:11:30] disciples they want the people to to
[1:11:32] come near to
[1:11:34] them there be many around
[1:11:37] them around him come and listen
[1:11:40] to I want to tell
[1:11:43] you he want he wants them to see he
[1:11:47] wants them to see the the the the the
[1:11:50] wife husband the husband
[1:11:55] I'm the only one that's the boss
[1:11:57] here that is incorrect
[1:11:59] Brothers the Apostle Paul
[1:12:02] say love thy
[1:12:05] wives just as Christ loved the
[1:12:08] church he gave himself for
[1:12:11] her he gave
[1:12:18] himself but an incorrect
[1:12:22] leader wants the the the attention on
[1:12:25] him or or on her yes or
[1:12:32] yes continue
[1:12:48] saying says therefore watch and remember
[1:12:50] that by the space of three years I cease
[1:12:52] not to warn everyone night and day with
[1:13:05] tears and now Brethren I commend you to
[1:13:07] God and to the word of his grace which
[1:13:09] is able to build you up and to give you
[1:13:11] an inheritance among all them which are
[1:13:14] Sanctified continues
[1:13:17] saying John knew of them also for he
[1:13:22] said
[1:13:26] many false prophets are already gone out
[1:13:27] into the
[1:13:32] world that Antichrist Spirit was already
[1:13:34] infiltrating
[1:13:37] church and it was doing it by going
[1:13:39] against the
[1:13:41] word why here is where it all
[1:13:44] started right here in the first church
[1:13:47] age already they were denying the
[1:13:50] word and setting up their own philosophy
[1:13:54] instead of the
[1:13:55] word that is
[1:13:57] Antichrist for Jesus is the
[1:14:00] word to be anti- word is to be anti
[1:14:04] Jesus to be
[1:14:06] anti- to be
[1:14:08] Antichrist because the spirit and the
[1:14:10] word are
[1:14:11] one if you're anti-
[1:14:13] word you will have to be
[1:14:17] Antichrist and if it started in the
[1:14:19] first
[1:14:20] church it will have to grow until the
[1:14:22] end
[1:14:25] when it takes
[1:14:30] over that is exactly what you will see
[1:14:32] as we cover all the
[1:14:34] ages it starts out real small in the
[1:14:36] Ephesian
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:40] age and it grows in every age until the
[1:14:42] anti- word
[1:14:46] Antichrist system takes over
[1:14:52] entirely
[1:14:55] and the infallibility of the word is
[1:14:57] repudiated by the false Apostles of the
[1:15:00] false
[1:15:06] church I want to read the the next verse
[1:15:10] verse
[1:15:15] three verse three and
[1:15:22] four
[1:15:24] and has born has patien and for my
[1:15:27] name's sake has labored and has not
[1:15:30] fainted now brother Alex
[1:15:34] read what it means to to to work for the
[1:15:37] love labor love his name what does it
[1:15:40] mean what does it
[1:15:42] mean you said
[1:15:46] amen what did he
[1:15:48] say
[1:15:50] serving the the the the Brethren of the
[1:15:52] Saints
[1:15:55] yes or
[1:15:58] yes isn't that what we
[1:16:00] read or do we need to read it
[1:16:09] again it says and has born and has
[1:16:11] patience and for my name sake has
[1:16:12] labored and has not
[1:16:15] fainted you know that's the only way to
[1:16:17] not
[1:16:18] faint is to do it for the love you have
[1:16:21] towards him
[1:16:23] if you do it without
[1:16:25] love sooner or later you will become
[1:16:28] weary you will
[1:16:33] complain you will you will let God
[1:16:38] um but if you do it for
[1:16:41] love you'll be able to withstand or bear
[1:16:45] it verse
[1:16:51] four never neveress I have somewhat
[1:16:54] against thee because thou has left thy
[1:16:55] first love that's the
[1:16:59] complaint the complaint was that they
[1:17:01] had left their first love yes sir
[1:17:05] yes now we've repeated it many times but
[1:17:08] I want to make
[1:17:10] sure that you've understood
[1:17:15] it how do you know that you love
[1:17:22] God

[1:17:28] us how do I know how much I love
[1:17:34] God see how much you you love your
[1:17:39] brethren are you with me
[1:17:42] brothers so when he says first

[1:17:56] God how do we know we love
[1:17:59] God you see how much you love your
[1:18:02] brethren yes or
[1:18:05] yes or or is there another
[1:18:08] definition could you love a god without
[1:18:11] loving your
[1:18:14] brethren you sound like you're you're
[1:18:17] doubting maybe it's the
[1:18:21] masks can can you love
[1:18:24] God without loving your
[1:18:29] brethren you can't be
[1:18:33] heard there's no way say there's no way
[1:18:38] to love
[1:18:40] God if you don't love your brethren
[1:18:43] there's no
[1:18:46] way there's no no
[1:18:50] way so God is is telling them
[1:18:54] this first
[1:18:56] age about their
[1:19:01] leaders but he's also speaking to
[1:19:05] us he tells
[1:19:09] them if you want to
[1:19:11] know who who a true leader
[1:19:14] is you have
[1:19:18] to why they're doing what they're
[1:19:21] doing why do they serve the way they
[1:19:24] serve what is their
[1:19:27] motive we could focus on the
[1:19:30] word but the word will take us back to
[1:19:36] this oh we could say oh it's because
[1:19:38] they they have the right
[1:19:40] word if they have the right word they're
[1:19:42] correct they're the Right
[1:19:44] leader but what does it mean to have the
[1:19:46] right
[1:19:47] word what does that
[1:19:51] mean Paul said I did not come to you
[1:19:55] knowledge I came to you with the power
[1:19:57] of the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost he reminded the people many
[1:20:03] times with how many tears I have served
[1:20:06] you remember what I did for you yes or
[1:20:12] yes the word will bring us back to this
[1:20:20] anyway the the the word will always
[1:20:22] bring you
[1:20:24] back to the right
[1:20:28] love because the all the
[1:20:32] word is
[1:20:34] is a a letter of
[1:20:41] love if you see it as as anything
[1:20:45] else you will miss the
[1:20:50] mark one day this word will would become
[1:20:53] the the the letter of
[1:20:55] judgment but for the Sons and Daughters
[1:20:58] of
[1:20:59] God the
[1:21:02] word is a letter of Love Yes or
[1:21:07] yes I'm
[1:21:10] telling on to read the message you know
[1:21:12] what I'm tell brother tells us that the
[1:21:18] Bible is a love
[1:21:21] letter
[1:21:24] and that his children his
[1:21:26] bride can read between the
[1:21:32] lines so the
[1:21:35] word will bring you back to to the right
[1:21:37] type of
[1:21:41] love the the word will not take away the
[1:21:44] love brother Bram tells us various
[1:21:48] times in this message of the Ephesian
[1:21:50] Church age when he preached it he
[1:21:55] says they had
[1:21:58] everything but they didn't have the
[1:22:00] right love they had they had the
[1:22:05] works but they didn't have the right
[1:22:08] love that will take you to the incorrect
[1:22:13] thing if you don't sew it in the right
[1:22:16] manner you you you will you will destroy
[1:22:19] it or it won't do any
[1:22:21] good
[1:22:24] from the bil brother Bram tells us the
[1:22:27] story of of of his son Billy Paul Paul
[1:22:31] the story of of brother Billy
[1:22:34] Paul he says that his
[1:22:36] daughter he was telling his his his
[1:22:41] wife you know my father
[1:22:44] says you know what he
[1:22:48] says she had closed the door and she had
[1:22:52] locked
[1:22:53] it and she
[1:22:58] answered but if you could only say it
[1:23:00] the way he says are you listening to me
[1:23:03] brother I'm about to
[1:23:07] finish you and I can focus on the
[1:23:10] word but if the the correct
[1:23:14] word not given in the right
[1:23:18] Spirit it will not bring the right
[1:23:21] thing
[1:23:23] if you just bring out the
[1:23:25] letter and try to give the letter to the
[1:23:28] people but it's not accompanied with
[1:23:32] love produce the incorrect thing in the
[1:23:39] person I know we could focus on the
[1:23:43] word
[1:23:45] apost they didn't have the right word
[1:23:48] that that is
[1:23:49] true but you can bring the right
[1:23:54] Doctrine in a bad Spirit
[1:23:57] it an
[1:24:04] antichrist that's why I'm focusing on
[1:24:11] love we could bring what brother Brown
[1:24:14] brought but we have to read between the
[1:24:16] lines you have to read between the
[1:24:21] lines
[1:24:23] you can have the right words are you
[1:24:25] listening to
[1:24:27] me with the incorrect
[1:24:31] Spirit that's why brother Bram tells
[1:24:34] us I'd rather have
[1:24:36] someone this is our Prophet tells
[1:24:39] us I'd rather have
[1:24:41] someone with the wrong
[1:24:44] Doctrine in other words with the wrong
[1:24:47] are you listening to
[1:24:48] me the doctrine is a
[1:24:51] teaching
[1:24:53] I'd rather have someone with the wrong
[1:24:56] Doctrine but with the right
[1:25:00] Spirit someone with the right
[1:25:03] teaching and the wrong
[1:25:05] spirit because if they have
[1:25:08] the sooner or
[1:25:11] later if you have the right Spirit it'll
[1:25:13] take up to the right
[1:25:15] thing is not the doctrine
[1:25:18] first the first thing is
[1:25:21] not first thing is
[1:25:25] love return to your first
[1:25:29] love oh the first love is the word of
[1:25:31] God God is teaching me the first
[1:25:36] thing is not the letter first
[1:25:40] thing is the right
[1:25:42] Spirit receive the right
[1:25:46] Spirit take you to the right
[1:25:50] Doctrine amen
[1:25:54] we want to apply the
[1:25:55] word with the wrong
[1:25:58] Spirits it will produce an
[1:26:04] antichrist when you try to show your
[1:26:07] brother and you just bring the
[1:26:10] word but don't bring it with
[1:26:13] love you don't want to help him you
[1:26:16] could kill
[1:26:19] him kill your whole family with the word
[1:26:24] you enter into the right Spirit
[1:26:27] first you have to do it with love
[1:26:30] first you have to say
[1:26:32] Lord help me to serve my brother help me
[1:26:36] to help
[1:26:37] him it hurts me to see him like that it
[1:26:40] hurts me to see her like
[1:26:42] that but I won't just bring the
[1:26:46] word I want to show them love
[1:26:49] first that they would know how much I
[1:26:51] love them
[1:26:55] brother Bram says to fill it with honey
[1:27:07] first so many people that I know in
[1:27:12] other
[1:27:19] places they have the word
[1:27:24] but they don't have the
[1:27:30] love that
[1:27:33] word is never swn right brother Bram
[1:27:41] says and testing you
[1:27:45] here but he talks about the vision
[1:27:48] that in that dream she saw the water
[1:27:50] falling and and and nothing could her it
[1:27:54] would
[1:27:56] go that
[1:27:59] that she could not get it until she put
[1:28:03] honey when she put
[1:28:05] honey she was able to hold
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:12] it says that the honey is is is
[1:28:14] brotherly love and without
[1:28:17] love that
[1:28:19] word we cannot retain it correctly
[1:28:27] we want to bring the word the
[1:28:32] teachings and brother brandom said it
[1:28:34] like
[1:28:35] that and the word says
[1:28:38] this but if we
[1:28:42] only if we just simply brought it in the
[1:28:45] same
[1:28:47] Spirit brother would go to the
[1:28:50] Pentecostals go to the Baptist
[1:28:53] anywhere he was
[1:28:54] invited and he loved
[1:28:56] them even though they did not believe
[1:28:58] the same he loved them I tried to help
[1:29:10] them now you see why the seed cannot
[1:29:13] bear
[1:29:15] fruit it was planted
[1:29:19] incorrectly the musicians can come
[1:29:21] forward
[1:29:34] I
[1:29:38] repeat we could
[1:29:44] say it's because they had the wrong
[1:29:47] Doctrine and that would be
[1:29:50] true
[1:29:53] a false teacher brings false
[1:29:56] Doctrine but I want you to notice what
[1:29:59] it says
[1:30:04] here you need to go back to your first
[1:30:07] love that is your
[1:30:16] problem we try to to uh construct our
[1:30:20] home
[1:30:24] with nothing but
[1:30:27] word but with the incorrect
[1:30:30] Spirit you will
[1:30:34] fail you will
[1:30:37] fail try to correct the brother or
[1:30:41] sister but without
[1:30:44] love with the incorrect Spirit you will
[1:30:48] fail you will grow weary
[1:30:53] you will faint sooner or
[1:30:55] later you you you want you want it to
[1:30:57] hold
[1:30:58] up you want it to grow
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:03] right we need the right Spirit
[1:31:07] first we need to go back to
[1:31:13] Pentecost Pentecost is not just what
[1:31:15] happened in the upper
[1:31:17] room
[1:31:18] Pentecost is what produced
[1:31:23] return to Pentecost is not
[1:31:24] simply believe in the
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:28] gifts return to
[1:31:31] Pentecost means
[1:31:33] returning do the same things that that
