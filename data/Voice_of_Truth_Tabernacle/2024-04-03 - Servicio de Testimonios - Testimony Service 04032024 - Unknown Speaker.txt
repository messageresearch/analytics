testimonies I believe there should always be testimonies we all have something to testify of we have something to glorify God about let's read and then we'll have our first testimony Ephesians 518 reads and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ let us pray heavenly father as your children testify Lord help us receive something I believe in a testimony service we can receive of you may our faith be increased may we see God working amongst us even today may we see you the same yesterday today and forever that we simply remember all the benefits you've had with us it's worth being Christian it's worth being your children it's worth having a great God like the one we serve what we're doing is not in vain we can see your wonders all the time we give you thanks for everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated our testimonies God bless you Brothers I want to read a scripture real quick it's Isaiah 4110 it reads like this it reads like this fear thou fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yeah I will help thee yah will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness maybe you're wondering why Abraham's here with me it's because he's the evidence of what I'm going to testify to you it's beautiful to have an Evidence when God does something for you and I have that evidence Brothers if we go back four years I remember that his leg always hurt him or his foot always hurt him maybe like for two years his foot always hurt him he'd come and look for us at night Dad he'd always cry always why me my heart to see him that way I couldn't tell him anything and he always took medicine every day three shots of medicine a day uh but one day he was he was showering and I remember that he came I seen him when he came out from showering Brothers he had something on his face something so beautiful i' never seen him with that kind of countenance on and he says dad he says to me he said God visited what do you mean God visited me and he told me that everything's going to be okay and I said blessed be the name of the Lord thanks be to God for being so good to us and he continued with his pain and then we uh some talk came about about having a surgery upon hearing about a surgery he just started to cry he would always cry about it and I told him oh it's just talk we're not it's not for sure yet and I asked God lord don't let him go to an emergency room or no lord they're not going to take him to a surgical room because your word says something something else I believe you and I know he's not going to go to one of those places we were remodeling a home where I was working and I took him for him to help me and my friend tells me Sammy what does he have wrong with his foot and I explained to him what happened and he told me take him to the doctor and I told him oh he's not going to need a doctor the Lord is going to heal him and my friend tells me do you think you're that special or something and that's how the devil tells us that we're not special but we are special we are children of God and by his grace we are special not make it so long I don't have much time the day comes when that surgery had to happen and he said dad I don't want to go we went to the surgery in Sacramento but he every time that we spoke of a surgery he would always cry a lot that day he was so calm I seen him and he was so calm I've seen such a beautiful piece within him and I went out disappointed I said Lord why I felt that God had failed me right then the surgery happened the do the doctor said the the boy's waking up do you want to go visit him and we went to go visit him he said Dad God visited me he told me to get [Music] up that happened after that he said dad will you buy me a ball sometime after I told him uh son whenever you start running I I'll buy you a ball nice Jersey whatever and I think it was four days after when he began to run again the Lord healed him so what I understood right then was that the Lord Works in his own way it wasn't the way that I wanted it was the way that he wanted it so one day some time passed and something came to my mind and I remember when he would ask me dad why did this happen to me and I told him Abraham the Lord wants for you to speak on what happened to you for you to testify maybe other kids are going through the same thing and they don't know where to go to you did know where you needed to go to go seek him the Lord did the work and now he's on a soccer team and he's one of the best God bless you the Lord is [Applause] good God bless you brethren I have something for the glory and honor of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ God's word reads in 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new Brothers last week I was testifying to some of my co-workers about the life I lived in 1994 and as I testified and by the time I finished testifying a voice came to my heart and spoke and said why haven't you testified this testimony you shared at your job in church so thought came to me and said you're going to have to ask for more time turns out when I came to receive my blessing the Angel of the church was here and I told him what happened at my job and I told them what do you think it's okay if I share this testimony because it's very dark you do it I just had the mechanics but I did not have the Dynamics he said if you didn't do the Dynamics there's no problem testify said you want me to write you down I said my brother's time run fast since my life was so sad I was looking for the way how to have power how to have power to have Revenge I would have close myself for dark books of the devil are or dark mag or uh black magic I studied and studied and filled myself with research when I had all the symbols the numbers I got to the point where he told me you're going to receive all the power I'll give you all the power but no no one gives anything in exchange for nothing for me to obtain and receive all the power he told me the devil told me we don't have any other name to call him Dev the devil told me I'll give you all the power in exchange for a child when he told me to offer him a child a voice in my deaths said stop stop there because that child will be sacrificed when that voice told to stop because a child would be for sacrifice I forgot about renge forg about I forgot about black magic I forgot about wanting to have power thank our Lord Jesus Christ why because the devil did not tra me it was because the Temptation was still there but the Lord delivered me I didn't do anything I just did research I did not use the Dynamics for obeying that voice and I can't say that voice was no one else but our Lord Jesus Christ because when he said stop I Clos the book God bless you brother and this is for the glory of our Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ God bless you Brothers I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I would also like to read a scripture in EC in the Book of Ecclesiastes it says when thou vow a vow unto God defer not to pay it for he ha no pleasure in fools pay that which thou has vowed that scriptures Brothers I got it because I made a promise to God I made a promise to God that I was going to testify of his great power of a miracle he did in my life I had some time struggling I don't know what I had wrong with I went to the doctor and various uh doctors or Physicians looked at me they said I checked out fine that everything was health I also went and they did a couple studies on me and they said everything was fine and then they would tell me something they said the next option would be to insert one of those little cameras down your throat to check you out and then when they said the price my eyes got is huge but I'm gonna go I said I'm going to go to the doctor of doctors and I began to ask God Brothers putting my faith into practice but then I would see that I continued on the same way and there came the point that the back of my head started hurting my back and I was almost fainting many times here at church I would get dizzy and almost fall over one time almost leaving I found myself with two brothers and God guided me towards them for them to pray and I began to put that faith into practi but nothing would happen but Friday that that our brother Isaac was here that he read Isaiah 53 he the I'm going to grab a hold to that all tell you Brothers this evening honor of God God has healed me God healed me yesterday I called brother Tito to tell him that I wanted to come forward and testify about it the devil's not ever satisfied brother my knee started to hurt after that and that whole evening I had a pain in my knee I I couldn't work today my knee was hurting the whole day but I had made AOW to God that I was going to testify I took some pills and I'm relaxed I going to be testifying that he's already healed it's a small testimony it's for us to Contin he is Hebrews 13 the same God of yesterday that many times the days of Miracles have passed it's the same God Brothers he's at 24 hours Jeremiah 333 says cry out to me and I'll respond to so then Brothers many times it we're shy to come forward I get shy even though I'm up here singing and the devil doesn't want for us to come forward and testify what God done our that's small testimony I hope it helps someone take all of my heart and I say that God has healed me God bless you [Applause] Brothers God bless you Brothers I've been nervous all day but I still want to do this and I said what God has done for me I can't stay [Music] quiet as I testify to a few sisters since September I've been struggling with my health since I went to Mexico I don't know what happened when I came back my heart started uh jumping a lot it was beating too fast so as I was in Mexico I went to the doctor the doctor told me I there was a big issue with me and I had to come see the doctor as soon as I got back and so I went to the doctor here in the states and they began to do ultrasounds and uh [Music] exams and what the doctor said blood is not reaching your heart and your heart is rejecting it and it's very dangerous because your heart can stop when that happens you shouldn't be alone immediately go to the ER when you feel that way so all of a sudden I did begin to worry and more because one day showering my heart started beating too fast and I was by myself and all I did was get out of the shower and dress myself and and go to the bed and I said if I die I'll die on my bed and that's how I've been these last few months not long ago I went to the doctor and they gave me an appointment and said since 2018 they detected lupus on and they said the lupus is affecting your heart your liver and we don't know what other organs are affected they explained everything to me and checked me so if there was no bruises or spots on my legs my body and they said you don't have it yet but sooner or later you will cuz your swollenness is very severe this swellness is going to start to break your muscles and imagine you're in a lot of pain because it's very severe after they explained everything with a very sad face she asked me how I felt I looked at her and smiled and said everything's fine I'm not afraid so she just looked at The Interpreter and patted me on the back and it was on a Sunday February 25th I was here in church speaking to the Lord and I said I don't believe everything they told me I believe you can heal me you're my physician and he me so many times why can't he do it again so the Sunday ended and we left home and I testified to my sister for about two hours over the phone and my husband came to clean the church and he got to the house around 8:00 and he said he wanted to go to sleep and I told him go to sleep and I started praying every night like always and when I finished praying I went to the kitchen and I left my bed ready with the lights off and everything and I left everything ready to not turn the light on and wake them up and I closed the door and I was doing a few things in the kitchen I turned everything off when I was ready to go to bed and for my surprise when I opened my bedroom door there was a shining light that strike my face it was such a golden light that I can still remember it and I went to go lay down where I was going to go to sleep and I turned everywhere and I thought what is happening and I was too excited very happy so I looked everyone and it looked like I was just in the middle of a big light and for the glory of God since that day and on I have so many symptoms have gone away since that day I believe I received my healing since that day my heart hasn't uh been at a fast pace and that's my testimony I have and I say I can't keep this to myself this is too great and God bless you [Applause] brother God bless you Brothers the scripture says that he sends Angel to care for you and to keep you in all your ways he says that they'll pick you up before your Foote heads a stone my testimony is about my brother and to talk about the great things that God has done as a family in my family um when I see that through so many trials that we've had to go through I see that God has always been there from our first steps in the denomination then knowing Christ in the message I can always see the hand of God at our side always brother Brandon says in the message he says I promise that from this night forward that I accept my healing and I call things that aren't as though they were because I believe in your word help me Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ um to say that you accept your healing call things out aren't as though they were it's something that I I speak about the life of my brother he was always very present to me we don't know what what time the spirit that he battled with for many years came into him from the time that my mother um passed on at 11 years of age he was 11 it was a strong hit to his life as it was to all of us but he was normally okay he was always happy and smiling but we didn't know how much he was struggling with in his mental health as the years went by it got worse but he was very cheerful he always had his head up even in the strongest draws that he had he always kept moving forward he never let himself and he would pray even more and give himself more to God when he fell and had his process it wasn't that literally fell he tried to suicide and he was unable to do it was because God had a purpose when he came out of all that God sent your angels to to keep you to care for you and he looked at me and he said no this time he didn't send his angels He himself SU sustained me it was a fall from a third step or from a third floor sorry when all of his bones and his body were broken and throughout all that process and the only thing that wasn't hurt or that didn't get hurt was his head he was no longer able to to touch his head he it touched his whole body but nothing happened to his head when he began his whole process in the hospital we always restore you he's going to forward put your best foot forward but inside of him there was no longer a desire to be here he had many years trying to go and be with my sister and mother and throughout his whole time at the process at home he disconnected himself he was always in contact with God when his accident happened something happened in my heart that told me that he was no longer going to be there be here but you one as a human you don't accept those things in the last week when he was going to begin rehab the strongest rehab he was going to be hospitalized for that rehab with that rehab he was going to be hooked up to machines or working with machines and doctors but a couple days before he went on to be with my mother and sister or he dreamt my mother and sister when he was going to the hospital his face with his face you could he always told you that he loved but in his face that day it was like if he was [Music] lost a couple days happened at this rehab center or a couple days past at the and he began to get worse until they had to hospitalize him at another place the first night he was there they had given him medicine because he'd got worse or he' got ill more ill and he had a heart attack in that night he' never been sick from his heart and after this heart attack you begin you begin to tell God oh God help him take him through this but the plans of God our per they're not our plans and God's never late so many years that he suffered from this illness God had to get there at the right time many years could pass but he's never late a day passed and that day we were always connected with him through the phone his face changed drastically although he had had his heart attack but what I seen in him was something Indescribable because his face was always a very Stern face because of the spirit that tormented him when the first heart attack happened on the second his face changed we could see that God had done the work in him that Spirit had left him and it was no longer tormenting him but God had to do it that way and get in there get there at the right time could be before three years prior or five or 10 you came at the right time he was prepared and he was healed and I say that with all certainty when the second heart attack came he was ready so God's never late and I give Glory H to God that because he's always present in our lives God bless you God bless you brother are you happy brother there's no reason to be sad we in a testimony service believe the Lord is the same yesterday today and forever he continues doing wonders the Lord has also G testimonies he's helped me and told me that he is with me as evil as I am God is with me I want to share a testimony how God brought me to his feet through my son eston really I didn't want anything to do with God but brother Hector said God has his way of working many times we want to do it our own way but you can't when my son was born we've already said many testimonies of my son he burned himself he was [Music] drowning but this time upon uh B uh birth delivery he was delivered in the wrong way and he couldn't strain up if you look at him in his booster se he was always a little crooked to the side the doctors would say that he was not going to walk that they H his vertebrae but I never surrendered I believe God and I know that sometimes God allows us to go through things so we can see God's greatness surrender to his feet I can see God's word brother that blind man when they told him who sinned so I thought that my faults my sins were uh following me but no Brethren today I'm sure that God loves every one of us and he lets us go through trials to see he is the same yesterday today and forever so I always got home from work sat down and look at him it was a sorrow as a parent you're always saying Why didn't it happen to me instead of my son you always want to fill in their shoes but God is real the devil wants us make us believe something else so he wasn't walking he couldn't walk I brother he never walked he would drag himself he would only crawl one time I asked God what should I do Lord what should I do Lord my son can't be there crawling and Something Told Me Brother tell the brothers to pray for your child that they pray God has power I was left alone speaking my many times as our brother said we're shy we're shy or embarrassed to ask for prayer or because a brother's doing things no Brethren God has given a gift to every man God gave us his word the gift is in the men Brethren so I as the pastor pastor Pastor can you pray for my son today not tomorrow or the day after right now please they said at the end of the service we'll pray for him and we came forward with my wife with faith the elders uh got around us and they prayed for my son and the pastor told me your son's going to walk believe it and I believed it brother I never disbelieved the word I was standing up and want him to walk but he would fall one evening I got home from work and I was talking with my wife we were sitting down different places and my son would crawl Brethren how is God's glory we want miracles to be done immediately but some time had to pass I got home from work my wife was sitting somewhere else and I was sitting somewhere else when my son EST ston he's here as a testimony he got up I remember he ran towards me he said Dad and he hugged me I said God is real brotherr we are a walking testimony brother if you haven't had something Supernatural happen to you believe that God is faithful and true if you haven't had a miracle how many have had a miracle hallelujah hallelujah brother has had a miracle God is here he's passing by if God did a miracle in my life he changed me from being a drunker a drug addict Mr Nobody to be his son because we have believed his word I believe in this message this message has brought restor in my marriage and family that's the greatest that God is the same yesterday today and forever my son estan is here as a witness the people told me why did you name him EST estan suffered a lot he was a martyr Steven when he was in his torture he saw the heavens open he saw Jesus sitting in his right hand waiting for him I believe God is waiting for every one of us to come to his feet God bless you [Applause] brethren God bless you my testimony is something God did for me nine years ago it all began when my mom began to congregate in a Christian Church she wanted to name me a uh another name that's actually very beautiful but her sister had more time in the message and she said why don't you name her like brother bram's daughter I believe my mother paid more attention to what God told her through her sister Shon and she named me Sharon or Rosa Sharon um I believe with all my heart since God chose for me to be here or he wasn't n happy I remember from when I was 5 years old he tried to take me off the scene A dog bit me in my face and throat and later when I was 9 years old I fell off a bicycle and almost lost my right eye and there's a lump in my brain in the back part that lasted for a while but then the Lord healed me more time passing we moved to the states um went to school had classmates I wasn't doing very well because it was a public school and it was very worldly um and more time [Music] pass we moved to Las Cruses and I thought all that was uh in my P it was finished I was going to have no more problems being in church and in the same time in the world but once again the enemy had another plan because I was not trying to get out of that circle with my friends I would go to church I would leave my house with lies or saying I had to do homework or schoolwork until I met a person so young men young ladies Wait For Your Right Time God has somebody special for you I remember that I remember the time I spent with this person it was just uh unhealthy in my mind and I couldn't take it anymore I spoke with my father I spoke with the pastor and I said I want something different I want to get closer to God I want to serve the Lord more I remember when I made this decision the devil and All His angels attacked me with depression anxiety for more than a year and a half I remember when I spoke with my pastor and my parents they brought brother Diego and he told meon sister Sharon if you don't come to the things of God it's not going to be death in a coffin going to be spiritual death for you that night my father put salt and uh pepper and he said you need to choose God or Satan and he said think about it well you know you'll have everything you want with God if you believe it it was very tough for me it was tough for my parents but by God's grace because of the pastor's help and the prayer I made the choice and decision to follow the lord Jesus Christ brother Diego told me after it's going to be two years of healing and then five years for you to meet your husband me as a young lady never did I think that would fulfill what I thank the Lord because he gave me a wonderful husband been and because I could wait in his word I know it hasn't been easy but with his help the promises he promised me he's fulfilled them and I believe he'll continue fulfilling them I hope this is useful to other youth that you don't have anything to be looking for in the world the world ain't going to give you anything but God will give you everything you want God bless [Applause] you amen amen hallelujah God bless you Brothers to make [Music] it think it that brother sister Angie's house they were speaking to the youth about stewardship and how to care about your care for your money know about budgeting the rest you don't want to get married and all that I began to look at my accounts and everything I got scared because I see that I didn't have enough um he uh thinking about preparing for the future and monetarily speaking I remember when I dislocated my shoulder I had to pay like $2,700 to the hospital and at the time I didn't have enough money for that but I think God's a businessman they say he's a God that's rich in Mercy I think that also God is Rich financially with his children I remember I asked for financial aid for [Music] that and they didn't get back to me with anything I spoke to my mom and dad about it and they said was time to pay some and I remember the time that that happened I prayed to God a simple prayer I sincere if you can say that I said God if I've seen demons in my life then why can't I see you in my life so I made that simple prayer just like that three days after that that I was with brother sister Angie I went to go check my medical bill and there I was seeing the account where it was was and I couldn't find it there was another uh bill you could say of two years prior but that had already been paid different one so I kept looking I found that amount that was due that 2,700 and I seen that said zero and I checked on the why the reason that it gave he said that the hospital had approved me for financial taken it all away I didn't have to pay anything but as brother Hector said the devil doesn't stay satisfied I think he was testing me to make short I had a problem last year not having insurance and I got into an accident and the insurance is right now charging me around 4,000 but if God did it with my medical bills then he can do it this time as well God bless you [Applause] Brothers the musicians can come forward let's stand Brothers how many are thankful with God it's very good to hear these things reminds us to so many things God has done for
