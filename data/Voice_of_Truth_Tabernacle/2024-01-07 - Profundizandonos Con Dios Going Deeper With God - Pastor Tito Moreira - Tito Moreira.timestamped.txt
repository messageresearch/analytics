[28:24] Kings Second
[28:26] Kings
[28:31] we're g to be looking at a story
[28:34] here that will open up our our our our
[28:37] the
[28:39] theme that we will be
[28:42] undertaking starting this new
[28:47] year we want to start a new
[28:51] theme that we'll be uh getting deeper
[28:54] with
[28:56] God getting deeper with God
[29:00] Amen second Kings chapter
[29:03] 3 second Kings chapter
[29:07] 3 verse
[29:09] n we welcome
[29:11] everybody we hope that you feel a
[29:14] home you are in the House of your
[29:17] father you are in your house amen
[29:22] amen to see brother and S
[29:26] here everybody
[29:29] else Second Kings
[29:34] 39 just to open up the scene a little
[29:39] bit the king of
[29:42] Israel or the king of
[29:46] Samaria joined with the king of
[29:48] Judah or the king of
[29:51] Jerusalem they both
[29:54] United against the moabites
[29:58] they had rebelled against
[30:03] them and as they went to go fight
[30:05] against the
[30:08] moabites they went through the desert of
[30:14] Adam and as they went the days
[30:16] navigating through the
[30:18] desert they found themselves without
[30:22] water and many became
[30:26] desperate they felt as though they were
[30:29] dying because they were there in the
[30:32] desert or Wilderness without
[30:34] water and sometimes we find ourselves in
[30:37] the same
[30:38] way we find ourselves in a desert
[30:41] without
[30:43] water it hasn't
[30:46] rained we haven't received blessings
[30:49] from
[30:49] God we haven't received our
[30:52] healing we haven't received our
[30:55] deliverance and we say say what are we
[30:57] going to
[30:58] do verse 9
[31:04] says so the king of Israel went and the
[31:06] king of Judah and the king of
[31:11] Edam and they fed the compass of seven
[31:14] days
[31:15] journey and there was no water for the
[31:19] host and for the cattle that followed
[31:22] them and the king of Israel
[31:26] said
[31:31] alas that the Lord have called these
[31:33] three kings together to deliver them
[31:34] into the hand of the
[31:36] Moab but Jehosaphat
[31:40] said is there not here a prophet of the
[31:44] Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by
[31:49] him and one of the king of Israel's
[31:52] servants answered and
[31:56] said
[31:59] here is Elisha the son of shafat which
[32:02] poured water on the hands of Elijah in
[32:05] other words let's seek
[32:09] God let's seek out what he has for us
[32:12] how can he help
[32:14] us and they found
[32:17] Elijah and they said he served
[32:20] Elijah he can help us as well that's
[32:26] right
[32:28] and Jehoshaphat said the word of the
[32:29] Lord is with
[32:31] him verse 13
[32:34] says they said for
[32:37] Elisha and he was a little
[32:40] irritated he was a little
[32:44] irritated because first of all they did
[32:46] as they wanted
[32:47] to and then they remembered about
[32:53] God many times we remember God when
[32:55] we're almost dying
[32:58] yes and elishah a little irritated
[33:02] says what have I to do with
[33:04] thee get you to the prophets of thy
[33:07] father and to the prophets of thy
[33:11] mother and the king of Israel said unto
[33:17] him nay for the Lord have called these
[33:19] three kings together to deliver them
[33:21] into the hand of the
[33:24] Moab and Elisha said as the Lord of host
[33:36] before whom I stand surely were it not
[33:38] that I regard the presence of
[33:39] Jehoshaphat the king of
[33:44] Judah so he was a little serious with
[33:49] him he says but now bring me a
[33:54] minstral a menst is is
[33:59] bring me some music bring me some
[34:01] worship so that I can soften my spirit a
[34:04] little
[34:06] bit
[34:08] and and it came to pass when the Minal
[34:11] played that the hand of the Lord came
[34:12] upon
[34:15] him and he said thus said the
[34:19] Lord make this Valley full of
[34:22] ditches for thus said the
[34:25] Lord shall not see wind
[34:28] shall you see
[34:30] rain yet that Valley shall be filled
[34:32] with
[34:34] water you may
[34:36] drink both
[34:38] ye and your cattle and your
[34:43] beasts and this is but a lightning in
[34:45] the sight of the
[34:48] Lord he will deliver the moabites also
[34:50] into your
[34:54] hand you shall Smite every friend City
[34:58] in every choice
[35:00] City and shall every good tree
[35:04] fall and stop all Wells of
[35:08] water and Mar every good piece of land
[35:10] with
[35:12] stones and it came to pass in the
[35:15] morning when the meat offering was
[35:22] offered that behold there came Water by
[35:25] the way of Edam and the country was
[35:26] filled with
[35:28] water let us pray Heavenly Father we ask
[35:33] Lord that may be your presence with us
[35:36] your word with us your Revelation with
[35:40] us as we open our
[35:43] hearts we desire to hear from you in the
[35:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[35:49] you may be
[35:51] seated uh getting deeper with
[35:55] God getting deeper with
[35:58] God last
[36:00] week I spoke with the
[36:03] subject uh wait stand up again get up
[36:07] again get up again stand get up
[36:11] again many times we have fallen
[36:15] right and we need to get back up and I
[36:20] said but the way to get
[36:23] up many times is go down because with
[36:29] God the way to go up is to come
[36:33] down with God I
[36:36] repeat the way to go up is to come
[36:42] down I will say
[36:45] this and I want you to write this
[36:49] down and I want you to KN which
[36:51] direction we're
[36:54] heading this is a theme we want to start
[36:56] with this year
[36:58] year and we need to understand this
[37:03] principle our
[37:05] capacity to rise or go
[37:08] higher
[37:12] depends on our capacity to go
[37:15] deeper I
[37:18] repeat many times we focus so much on
[37:21] going
[37:23] higher oh I need we I need to go higher
[37:25] with God
[37:28] I need to go
[37:30] higher and because since we know we're
[37:34] Eagles we want to go very
[37:38] high but I find out that with
[37:43] God before being able to go
[37:48] higher you have to be able to go deeper
[37:51] with
[37:53] him the capacity of a tree
[37:58] to be able to flourish or go or get
[38:06] bigger depends on how deep The Roots can
[38:08] get in the
[38:10] Earth but
[38:13] we many times we don't focus on
[38:17] that because it's something that's not
[38:21] seen it's something that's not
[38:25] noticed
[38:27] people can't worship me or praise me
[38:30] for I can't boast about
[38:34] it because when you go
[38:38] deeper that means the people aren't
[38:40] seeing
[38:41] that but I ask you this question
[38:45] Church how deep is your relationship
[38:47] with
[38:50] God oh coming to church everybody sees
[38:54] you how you worship how you
[38:57] sing how you will
[39:00] preach what about the things that people
[39:02] can't
[39:04] see what about your private life with
[39:07] God what about your prayer in your
[39:11] closet nobody else knows
[39:14] about what about your
[39:17] faith what about your Devotion to
[39:20] God what
[39:22] about your dedication sir
[39:27] those are things that nobody can see
[39:29] come on
[39:31] church we like to work in the things
[39:33] where everybody can see
[39:35] us we like to get better in the
[39:38] preaching get better in the
[39:41] worship but we don't get
[39:44] better on the things that people cannot
[39:48] see we don't
[39:51] work on the things that are that go
[39:53] deeper with God that's true
[39:57] that is
[39:58] true now
[40:01] look Ephesians uh 3:14
[40:11] says he says for this cause I bow my
[40:14] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[40:18] Christ of whom the whole family Heaven
[40:20] and Earth is
[40:23] named he says now I bow my knees
[40:31] that he would Grant you according to the
[40:32] riches of his
[40:39] glory to be strengthened with might by
[40:42] his spirit in the Inner
[40:45] Man I want you to
[40:48] notice where these riches are found
[40:52] Church many of
[40:54] us are depending
[40:58] on the things that we can find in in the
[41:02] external but I want you to
[41:07] understand riches are found in the
[41:12] inside where are the riches of this
[41:14] Natural
[41:16] Earth they are found within the
[41:20] Earth say again Treasures are found
[41:24] within the
[41:25] Earth
[41:27] the treasures are in the
[41:30] depths even the
[41:34] riches is because somebody was
[41:36] willing to
[41:38] dig to
[41:40] work to make the work
[41:43] heart and seek those
[41:46] diamonds and seek that oil or
[41:50] petroleum riches aren't out there in
[41:53] space
[41:55] Church they're not up there in the
[41:59] clouds riches even of this
[42:02] Earth they are in the depths of
[42:05] the god hid
[42:12] them he
[42:21] says verse 16 that he would Grant you
[42:24] according to the riches of his glory to
[42:25] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[42:27] in the inner
[42:36] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[42:39] by faith that ye being rooted and
[42:41] grounded in
[42:45] love before a building can be uh
[42:48] constructed
[42:52] higher the foundations have to be very
[42:55] well
[42:58] of something that is strong and and
[42:59] founded
[43:02] well before a tree can grow
[43:08] higher it has to expand its roots to the
[43:12] depths no wonder Martin Luther
[43:15] said my
[43:17] Temptations My
[43:20] tribulations they forced
[43:24] me to seek God
[43:27] deeper I
[43:30] repeat Martin
[43:32] Lu how many have
[43:35] tempations how have
[43:38] tribulations many of us say
[43:41] Lord why do I spend so many time in
[43:44] church and I can't
[43:47] overcome I still have
[43:49] temptations I still have tribulation
[43:52] come on
[43:54] church or did you already overcome
[43:58] everything so those of you that overcame
[44:02] everything you just haven't realized how
[44:04] much problems you really
[44:07] have how many of us here are
[44:11] sincere and you say Lord I haven't had
[44:13] there things that I can't
[44:14] overcome and Martin Luther
[44:16] [Applause]
[44:18] say oh that just forced
[44:25] me to seek God's the the depth of God
[44:28] even even
[44:29] deeper when it hasn't rained when it
[44:32] hasn't
[44:34] rained the
[44:38] plants the vegetation seeks out the
[44:41] depths I want to tell you
[44:44] church I to tell you this
[44:47] morning it is time to get deeper with
[44:50] God I repeat it is
[44:53] time to get deeper with God
[44:56] look at your neighbor and say it's
[44:58] time to get deeper with
[45:02] God come on
[45:05] church we need a deeper
[45:09] worship we need a deeper
[45:12] love
[45:14] something that can sustain us through
[45:16] the
[45:18] tri let me tell you the storms are going
[45:20] to get more
[45:22] difficult the battles will be harder
[45:27] the waves will rise
[45:30] higher anchor that will go to the
[45:33] death they can withstand
[45:36] the they can withstand the pain they can
[45:41] withstand everything the devil brings
[45:43] against
[45:49] us your superficial relationship with
[45:52] God will
[45:53] not
[45:54] small oh Lord I love
[45:57] you that will not hold
[46:00] you that won't withstand come on
[46:04] church say I come to church on
[46:06] Sunday glory to God for
[46:09] that continue getting deeper with
[46:13] [Laughter]
[46:15] God because that relationship is not
[46:20] enough we have a superficial
[46:22] relationship with
[46:24] God
[46:26] we depend on the
[46:27] rain we depend on the
[46:30] rain we depend on the blessings of
[46:33] God but a Son of
[46:36] God that has been planted by God doesn't
[46:40] depend on the
[46:42] rain if it rains or it
[46:44] does he goes and seeks out the
[46:47] water he goes and seeks
[46:50] the goes into the depths of
[46:54] God
[46:59] Lu Martin Luther
[47:02] said my
[47:05] Temptations they forced
[47:09] me to go deeper with
[47:12] God if you say this morning
[47:16] brotherto God hasn't answered my he
[47:19] hasn't Delivered come on
[47:23] Church let's be sincere for a moment
[47:27] the church hasn't been
[47:29] enough to deliver me of this
[47:32] Spirit there's somebody there's somebody
[47:35] here that
[47:36] say it hasn't been
[47:41] enough present relationship with God
[47:43] hasn't been
[47:44] enough to take away the things that are
[47:48] hindering and I tell you
[47:50] Church go
[47:53] deeper go deeper with him
[47:57] if you haven't found him
[47:59] yet found your deliverance
[48:02] yet go deeper with
[48:04] him sooner or
[48:07] later you will find the
[48:10] Fountain of Living
[48:13] Waters that can
[48:15] satisfy that desire in your
[48:22] heart on one
[48:24] occasion
[48:26] God found himself with a Samaritan
[48:30] woman and you know God likes to find us
[48:33] at the
[48:35] Wells there's something special about a
[48:38] well something special about a
[48:41] well a good
[48:43] well it always has
[48:48] water a good well doesn't depend on the

[51:29] worship where do you get it out of
[51:31] Brother Where do you get it
[51:33] from song

[51:41] God if my worship comes out of
[51:45] that oh I don't need a
[51:48] Revival give glory to
[51:51] God he ask
[51:54] me and
[51:56] [Applause]

[52:22] worship because there's something
[52:24] profound and deep there
[52:32] I tell you
[52:33] Church continue to
[52:36] dig go
[52:39] deeper your deliverance isn't some place
[52:42] come on
[52:44] Church the Holy Ghost is in a some God
[52:48] is not a
[52:49] liar his word is
[52:52] true you haven't found him yet
[52:56] deeper with
[52:58] [Applause]
[53:00] him your healing is there your
[53:03] deliverance is
[53:11] there Paul continues saying
[53:14] here Verse
[53:18] 18 I'll read 17
[53:23] Again that Christ May dwell in your
[53:26] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[53:27] grounded in
[53:39] love may be able to comprehend with All
[53:42] Saints what is the breadth and length
[53:44] and depth and
[53:50] height verse 20
[53:54] says
[54:00] now unto him that is able to do
[54:01] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[54:04] ask or
[54:05] think now
[54:08] look Paul tells
[54:13] them I want you to go deeper with
[54:17] God I want you to
[54:21] understand the the the the the length
[54:24] the bread
[54:26] of God or the W that's
[54:29] fine when we are converted to God we
[54:32] come to
[54:34] church we begin to know many things
[54:39] right we begin to see the the
[54:42] superficially the WID and
[54:44] the we just fill ourselves with the
[54:47] word we we eat the
[54:51] books we fill ourselves with
[54:54] knowledge
[54:57] to try to know what this is what that
[55:00] is that is the the width and the
[55:03] length but then Paul says but don't stay
[55:08] there now learn about the
[55:12] depths notice how he puts the depth
[55:15] before the
[55:17] height because you cannot go higher with
[55:20] God if you don't get deeper with
[55:23] him the word of God Is So
[55:27] exact he doesn't say height before
[55:31] depth he says the depth first say the
[55:35] depth
[55:36] first say the depth is
[55:42] first we want to explore the outer
[55:46] space and we haven't explored what God
[55:48] has given
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:52] us sometimes we think
[55:56] that the depths of
[55:58] God are complicated
[56:01] things that are things that are very
[56:05] complicated that's not what depths are
[56:07] about the depth is
[56:14] simply understand what we've learned
[56:18] come on
[56:19] Church the
[56:23] depth has to do with understanding what
[56:25] we've
[56:28] learned sometimes we learn a lot but we
[56:30] understand very little I
[56:33] repeat sometimes we learn a
[56:35] lot there are people that learn a lot
[56:39] and God bless them you have a good
[56:42] memory you have a good way of
[56:44] learning but they understand very
[56:49] little the Pharisees in the time of
[56:52] Jesus they knew a lot they learned a
[56:56] lot but they understood very
[57:00] little they understood very little what
[57:02] it
[57:05] meant you
[57:08] say I understand what worship
[57:12] is I've learned how to worship
[57:16] God but do you truly
[57:23] understand
[57:27] don't just talk about
[57:29] it don't just learn it by
[57:32] memory do you understand
[57:38] it we just simply stay
[57:41] with with one word of
[57:46] God and every day just go deeper with it
[57:50] let me tell
[57:51] you I do I do not comprehend completely
[57:55] I do not completely
[57:58] understand how it is that his blood has
[58:01] so much
[58:03] power if we would just stay with the
[58:05] blood of
[58:07] Jesus we want to run all over the
[58:10] place but if we just
[58:12] simply stay
[58:15] still trying to understand a little bit
[58:19] more in what God has put in our hands
[58:22] yes sir yes
[58:23] sir
[58:25] I don't completely understand brother uh
[58:27] Isaac I haven't finished
[58:31] understanding I haven't gotten to it
[58:32] complete
[58:34] understanding the blood of Jesus
[58:36] Christ can do so much for
[58:38] me do so much for
[58:41] you every day I come to
[58:43] service I say once again
[58:46] Lord your blood over my
[58:49] life every time I
[58:52] sin I understand it a little more
[58:56] understand his love a little bit
[59:00] more every time I worship
[59:03] him I don't want to worship just to
[59:06] worship just
[59:08] to I want to serve just to
[59:11] serve I want to understand what I'm
[59:14] doing I want to understand what he's
[59:15] given
[59:21] me
[59:23] Hallelujah so he says
[59:26] before going
[59:28] higher you have to understand the
[59:34] depths is that fine with
[59:37] you Paul
[59:40] said and uh Romans
[59:44] 11:33 all the
[59:46] depth all the depth come on
[59:51] church if that doesn't get you excited I
[59:54] don't know what
[59:57] does oh the
[59:59] de of the
[1:00:01] riches both of the
[1:00:04] wisdom and knowledge of
[1:00:06] God oh if you
[1:00:09] realize that the riches of
[1:00:12] God are in the
[1:00:18] depths the
[1:00:20] depth of the
[1:00:23] riches both of the
[1:00:25] wisdom and knowledge of
[1:00:29] God how unsearchable are his
[1:00:32] judgments and his ways past finding
[1:00:36] out for who had known the mind of the
[1:00:40] Lord or who has been his
[1:00:43] counselor or who has first given to
[1:00:47] him and it shall be recompensed unto him
[1:00:50] again for of him and through him and to
[1:00:53] him are all
[1:00:57] things him be glory forever
[1:01:01] amen in him is everything I need oh
[1:01:04] church if you understood that you
[1:01:08] wouldn't seek anything else you would
[1:01:11] just to go deeper with
[1:01:14] God to go further with
[1:01:17] him right Brothers we
[1:01:21] need to peel back the layers
[1:01:26] you know God has
[1:01:29] layers you know the word of God has
[1:01:32] layers
[1:01:35] says that there's things in the
[1:01:37] Bible they have a
[1:01:40] twofold they have a compound
[1:01:42] meaning a tri a three-fold
[1:01:48] meaning the the ministry of Elijah had
[1:01:51] was a
[1:01:53] fivefold layers
[1:01:59] the word of God has
[1:02:01] layers sometimes we just get to the
[1:02:03] first
[1:02:05] layer God is
[1:02:08] [Applause]
[1:02:12] love have you asked yourself what that
[1:02:14] means to to to to
[1:02:17] me what does it mean that he was going
[1:02:19] to send an Elijah in our time people
[1:02:21] read about it they just stay with that
[1:02:26] you would go deeper for you
[1:02:30] realize how much riches there are
[1:02:35] there it's
[1:02:37] time to peel back the
[1:02:42] layers to peel back the layers of our
[1:02:45] worship come on
[1:02:49] Church oh Lord I'm
[1:02:52] worshiping our mind is somewhere
[1:02:56] else you came to
[1:02:59] church fine that's a
[1:03:01] layer there's nothing wrong with
[1:03:03] that but peel back the
[1:03:05] layer peel back the
[1:03:08] layer Let Yourself Loose a little bit
[1:03:11] more begin to see what your need
[1:03:14] is to see what your worship
[1:03:16] is that's why God
[1:03:19] told God seeks true
[1:03:22] worshippers wor those that worship
[1:03:24] spirit and
[1:03:25] truth that don't worship him in the
[1:03:28] flesh or just out of
[1:03:30] emotion or for
[1:03:32] music worship Him in spirit and in
[1:03:41] truth it's time to peel back the layers
[1:03:43] brother
[1:03:44] Ro a worship is just not a superficial
[1:03:47] worship is
[1:03:49] not God doesn't want a superficial
[1:03:51] relationship with us that's right
[1:04:02] in the message God hiding himself in
[1:04:09] Simplicity Lord Jesus in the way of
[1:04:11] humility in the way of humbleness I
[1:04:12] offer you this congregation that's on
[1:04:14] their
[1:04:16] feet offer them to you because they
[1:04:18] have in response to the
[1:04:23] call they're seeking deeper
[1:04:27] things you know brother prayed for a lot
[1:04:29] of
[1:04:31] people and to many he would tell
[1:04:36] them you're seeking the deeper things of
[1:04:39] God and that's why God is answering
[1:04:43] sir brother says
[1:04:48] here they're seeking deeper things
[1:04:52] says myself voice through
[1:04:55] Tabernacle are you seeking the deeper
[1:05:04] things to love God
[1:05:09] deeper to experiment God in a more
[1:05:11] intimate way hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:17] Brothers worship him in a deeper
[1:05:20] way to know
[1:05:22] him understand
[1:05:25] to know your
[1:05:28] God he continues
[1:05:31] saying they're seeking more
[1:05:36] life after hearing them that the blood
[1:05:38] of
[1:05:40] Jesus that there is nothing
[1:05:44] more that the complete word of God Rest
[1:05:46] within
[1:05:48] them it's
[1:05:51] fine to know that the blood saves you
[1:05:54] it's fine to
[1:05:56] know that he paid a price for
[1:05:59] you but that's not all of
[1:06:03] it that's not all of
[1:06:06] it there's a more consecrated
[1:06:09] life there's a more deeper
[1:06:12] experience there's a deep a greater
[1:06:17] worship
[1:06:23] Hallelujah
[1:06:27] says they're seeking the deeper
[1:06:33] things that the very command of their
[1:06:36] own voice is is creative power because
[1:06:38] in them is the Holy
[1:06:40] Ghost this Holy Ghost is a
[1:06:43] Creator makes things come to
[1:06:45] pass because he speaks the
[1:06:48] word and the word spoken becomes God in
[1:06:53] action
[1:06:55] and Lord I pray that you'll send the
[1:06:56] Holy
[1:06:57] Ghost upon every one of them just
[1:07:01] now and in the power of the resurrection
[1:07:03] of
[1:07:06] Christ the things that they are Desiring
[1:07:08] in their heart a better
[1:07:11] life the baptism of the
[1:07:13] spirit Lord may it be so
[1:07:18] why why is God
[1:07:20] willing why is he willing to give you
[1:07:22] more because there's somebody that wants
[1:07:26] more the Bible says he that seeks shall
[1:07:28] find but you have to seek it
[1:07:37] out I ask you this
[1:07:40] question are you
[1:07:48] seeking are you
[1:07:52] seeking
[1:07:57] are you
[1:08:00] seeking going back to the story from the
[1:08:05] beginning here is Elijah
[1:08:10] Elisha once again in the second
[1:08:13] Kings here's
[1:08:17] Elisha and he says chapter
[1:08:21] three he he's taking it here in
[1:08:24] stages he
[1:08:27] says I need a little bit of
[1:08:30] worship that's what we do we come to
[1:08:34] church and worship
[1:08:38] begins you need to enter into that
[1:08:40] Spirit of
[1:08:43] worship that Spirit of worship prepares
[1:08:45] you It prepares you for what is
[1:08:50] coming it softens the
[1:08:52] Earth you have to dig up later come on
[1:08:59] Church prepares the soil
[1:09:02] the enter into that
[1:09:06] worship with worship and
[1:09:09] Thanksgiving wor
[1:09:14] worship even our
[1:09:19] prayer Be Our Father who art out in
[1:09:22] heaven holy be
[1:09:24] name it begins with
[1:09:27] worship it begins with
[1:09:30] worship because it begins to prepare
[1:09:33] us but Elijah doesn't leave it
[1:09:36] there as he's
[1:09:38] worshiping I imagine he was
[1:09:40] worshiping I didn't think he was there
[1:09:42] serious I don't think he was there with
[1:09:44] his arms
[1:09:46] crossed come
[1:09:48] on I imagine that Elijah El I don't
[1:09:55] he said to bring a
[1:09:56] worshiper because he wanted a
[1:09:58] worship he wanted to enter into the
[1:10:06] spirit yes he he sent for a menstrual or
[1:10:11] musician because he wanted to enter into
[1:10:14] the worship brother brandham
[1:10:17] says in the message making of the valley
[1:10:20] full of
[1:10:22] ditches
[1:10:25] Spanish I hope
[1:10:27] sounds he I
[1:10:30] said so when the prophet was irritator
[1:10:34] upset and he said bring a
[1:10:38] Minstrel and the the the the Min began
[1:10:41] to
[1:10:43] play the hand of the Lord came upon the
[1:10:49] prophet and if music brought brought the
[1:10:51] power of God at
[1:10:52] then it will bring the power of God now
[1:10:56] that's just
[1:10:57] exactly God's still the
[1:11:00] same now the
[1:11:02] prophet you may not you may not be the
[1:11:05] prophet but you could be the
[1:11:09] Min you can be part of it
[1:11:12] anyhow to bring the power of
[1:11:15] God they started to
[1:11:19] pray and elishah got in the spirit and
[1:11:22] he saw a vision
[1:11:25] when he saw the
[1:11:28] vision go out yonder in that
[1:11:31] desert right where you're

[1:13:17] rain but there will be water that will
[1:13:19] come from the way of the Wilderness
[1:13:21] why where that water come from
[1:13:24] from that
[1:13:25] rock that smitten rock that was in the
[1:13:27] wilderness that's
[1:13:29] right was back there
[1:13:32] somewhere it might have been covered
[1:13:36] up I ask
[1:13:38] you is your blessing covered
[1:13:42] up can it be that you're on top of your
[1:13:45] your blessing you're
[1:13:47] standing on your
[1:13:50] blessing it be that you're standing on
[1:13:52] your blessing
[1:13:57] there was the his
[1:14:00] Blessing says maybe it was covered
[1:14:02] up why because it was
[1:14:06] underneath it was running
[1:14:08] underneath come on
[1:14:14] church but maybe it was covered
[1:14:19] up there was a smitten Rock in there
[1:14:22] that Moses smoked
[1:14:24] coming through the
[1:14:25] Wilderness and that smitten
[1:14:28] Rock still lays Yonder
[1:14:32] too to be touched
[1:14:34] tonight Waters of
[1:14:37] life and now
[1:14:41] notice they went without any evidence of
[1:14:45] having
[1:14:46] water the first thing he had to do was
[1:14:49] prepare a
[1:14:50] ditch for the water to come in
[1:14:54] you get what I mean my time I have to
[1:14:58] hurries to get to this point
[1:15:04] look the deeper they
[1:15:07] dug the more Waters they
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] got the deeper they
[1:15:18] dug the more water they
[1:15:22] obtained sometimes all it
[1:15:25] is is just a little bit of
[1:15:27] soil a little bit of
[1:15:30] dirt the dirt Upon
[1:15:33] Us Shake
[1:15:35] Yourself Shake yourself off a little bit
[1:15:38] shake off that
[1:15:39] Ang shake out the things of the
[1:15:42] world set them
[1:15:52] aside
[1:15:55] he
[1:15:57] says the more water they the more they
[1:16:03] dug perhaps maybe you you'll go in and
[1:16:06] and find a little tin
[1:16:08] can throw it
[1:16:13] out that's the guy that says the days of
[1:16:15] Miracles is
[1:16:17] passed just kick them out of the
[1:16:20] way dig
[1:16:22] on down
[1:16:25] there and then when you hit another one
[1:16:27] that
[1:16:31] says well I tell you what I believe
[1:16:33] these things are just simply a a psycho
[1:16:35] workout mental telepathy or
[1:16:38] something that's what they would say of
[1:16:39] brother
[1:16:40] brand that's what they say in these
[1:16:43] days it is telepathy
[1:16:47] psychology let me tell you it's not
[1:16:49] psychology
[1:16:51] not it's the spirit of
[1:16:53] God he is
[1:16:56] real he is more real than anything
[1:16:59] else more real than this
[1:17:01] world more real than what you can
[1:17:04] see more real than what you can
[1:17:06] touch he is so
[1:17:10] real get that out of the way and keep
[1:17:14] digging that's
[1:17:17] correct the deeper you
[1:17:20] dig the more water you'll have
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:30] amelu the musicians can't come
[1:17:43] forward Jesus Christ said
[1:17:48] this if the grain of wheat does not fall
[1:17:51] into the
[1:17:52] ground
[1:17:53] notice how he says it has to fall into
[1:17:55] the the the
[1:17:57] ground it just
[1:18:02] remains but if it
[1:18:05] dies it Bears much
[1:18:08] fruit on in another
[1:18:11] Parable in Matthew
[1:18:14] 13 He
[1:18:16] says the same day went out Jesus out the
[1:18:21] house
[1:18:27] and when he seed his some seeds fell by
[1:18:28] the
[1:18:29] wayside and the fs came and devoured
[1:18:32] them
[1:18:32] up some fell upon Stony
[1:18:35] places where they had not much
[1:18:38] Earth and forward they sprung
[1:18:42] up because they had no deepness of
[1:18:45] Earth and when the sun was up they were
[1:18:50] scorched because they had no root
[1:18:53] they withered
[1:18:58] away isn't that so many
[1:19:01] times we receed something on behalf of
[1:19:06] God but since it never got
[1:19:12] deeper it grows
[1:19:15] [Music]
[1:19:17] quickly people can see
[1:19:21] that
[1:19:23] but what they can't see is how how weak
[1:19:26] we are
[1:19:28] within so the trial comes Temptation
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:33] comes and it takes away what God has
[1:19:36] given
[1:19:38] us because there's no
[1:19:45] depth because our relationship with God
[1:19:47] Is So superficial so
[1:19:51] shallow it's it's just a relationship on
[1:19:54] a Sunday
[1:19:56] only or it's just a relationship like oh
[1:19:58] only when I go to
[1:20:00] church it's a
[1:20:05] relationship that can't withstand or
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:12] endure I don't want that type of
[1:20:16] relationship I don't want that type of
[1:20:18] relationship with
[1:20:21] God I want to know
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:25] him in a such an intimate
[1:20:30] way I find everything I need in
[1:20:34] him I don't need to find it in any other
[1:20:38] place all of the riches of his glory are
[1:20:41] in

[1:46:18] Amen we give thanks to God
[1:46:21] for his holy
[1:46:22] spirit amongst
[1:46:25] us I was
[1:46:29] meditating right now there's a war in
[1:46:33] Israel Hamas against
[1:46:38] Hamas and the territory of
[1:46:43] Palestine the war isn't
[1:46:47] superficial the biggest problem Israel
[1:46:49] has right now is
[1:46:56] it's because Hamas finds himself under
[1:46:58] the
[1:47:04] Earth so they they weren't ready to
[1:47:06] fight that
[1:47:08] way they had
[1:47:10] airplanes they had
[1:47:12] tanks they all the
[1:47:17] equipment to fight on land and in the
[1:47:19] sky
[1:47:21] but the problem
[1:47:23] is don't have tools to
[1:47:28] fight and the
[1:47:30] tunnels that Hamas
[1:47:35] created and that's how Hamas have been
[1:47:37] able to
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:43] survive creating a system underneath the
[1:47:46] ground under and I ask
[1:47:49] myself
[1:47:51] Lord is that a type of
[1:47:53] us Israel is a type of the
[1:47:57] church and I believe
[1:48:00] nowadays the war is not fighting Among
[1:48:04] Us it's in
[1:48:07] US underneath the the the
[1:48:11] land
[1:48:13] hidden from the sight of everyone
[1:48:19] else
[1:48:21] say how tremendous is that
[1:48:23] Lord give us the
[1:48:28] wisdom tunnel are sometimes 200t deep or
[1:48:36] more they have so many things down
[1:48:40] there and the Israelite
[1:48:42] soldiers are fearful to go down
[1:48:47] there because it's a dangerous territory
[1:48:51] and I say it's a dangerous
[1:48:54] territory but God has given us the
[1:48:57] tools God has given us the right
[1:49:00] weapons to overcome the
[1:49:03] enemy Jesus Christ was
[1:49:07] not before descending he had to ascend
[1:49:10] before Ascend he
[1:49:12] had before
[1:49:16] ascending he had what he
[1:49:19] needed
[1:49:22] were
[1:49:23] underground and
[1:49:26] he I have taken the
[1:49:29] [Applause]
[1:49:30] keys I have the keys
[1:49:34] of I have the keys to
[1:49:38] hell the keys in our
[1:49:41] hands say do not
[1:49:43] fear he
[1:49:46] is just keep the
[1:49:49] pattern
[1:49:52] that's the war we're
[1:49:56] fighting but we have the
[1:50:04] tools we being uh doing a special
[1:50:08] presentation after
