lightly it's a great responsibility because one day we're going to be accountable for what we speak each and every one of us Josue 24 14-15c it reads like this now therefore free the Lord and serve him with sincerity and in truth is and put away from among you the gods whom your father served on the other side of the river and in Egypt and served Jehovah 15 says like this foreign choose for yourself say whom you will serve whether to the gods whom your father served when they were across the river or to the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord this morning that you come into control of me if you take control of the audience just one word in their hearts that there be able to be a change and that we'd be able to leave this place in my house will serve the Lord our pastor spoke to us about this eight days ago and he said this he says I love Joshua's words when he unites his family and says I in my house will serve the Lord pastor says I love it when he says those words because he shows leadership and this is the key here Brothers he's showing leadership not taking the position of someone else [Music] and he says and it shows that he at his house were in agreement he was not forcing his home he was not at odds with his home um I was thinking a little bit personal on my personal life this morning if you want to live better or if you want to live worse this is an election for you there was a choice yesterday to prepare to come with expectations see something from God there's someone greater than Canada so happy because I'm on that side on The Winning Side now you have the choice to go and do bad things to come today to watch the fight don't misunderstand you know your conditions what do you want for yourself maybe you put yourself in that position I myself put myself in that position activities [Music] I need to show my children unity in the in the children that's what's being spoken about right and this this is because it's going to help us not everything in life is is difficult or easy foreign you choose them for me so they can see it is foreign that's why I put myself in service because I love him because he's giving me so much I believe he's also giving you a lot there's no words foreign the only thing you can do is put yourself in service to him they affected us look and acceptance amen Brothers you're too quiet Brothers don't tell me that you all stayed up late to watch the fight who won and who lost it's okay who won that's good Brothers Mexicans right a man you know one of the things this message has taught me in the middle just maintain in the middle says so then the choices we make in our lives look Brothers if you want to be bitterness forgive me I want to be a bitter Christian then you will be a bitter Christianity and no one is the only one that's going to hold you back is yourselves you're going to send your own self to hell oh oh heavy condios or or keep up okay with God you yourself you're gonna choose just as you had to prepare yes you need to encourage yourself don't wait for it for someone else you need to encourage yourself you tell yourself [Applause] it [Applause] [Music] has to to be manifested I say it by experience because me and my youth I made a lot of bad decisions just as many of you is perhaps has affected affected you later sometimes we make right now they're going to affect you later if you choose the incorrect words because you can't preach something that you're not living yes sir it's impossible yo yo yo yo yo me myself you have to sanctify yourself to give life to others want our children to have life how do we want to get our children together if I'm dead your creator I was all sick yesterday it wasn't a strong pain it was just more of a pain though it hurt me kind of here in the center and I just felt bad brothers my throat was hurting don't worry it's not covered I was about to call the pastor brother text message him it continues hurting you can see yourself in the last book of life oh no or not the choices that you made today and they told them that hey come and help us find the the ammonites and he they told him if you come and help us and help us win then you'll be our governor but here's the detail Brothers accepted before going to Wario and he prayed oh and he said look at what he promised God when you're under the anointing watch what you say that's what you said don't allow just to any kind of worship your mouth and he said if you give me the victory the first person coming back I will give it as a sacrifice to you didn't think Brothers we don't think about what we say s when you promised God you're going to serve him every day of your life and what happened is that condition the way it is if we're supposed to be foreign foreign [Music] amen fathers when you decide to be a parent you choose to suffer Ed especially when they get sick we're new parents and they get sick or we we worry a lot and there he was he tore his clothes and he knew Brothers he had to fulfill his word because he was under the anointing you have not have made a bad decision he said you yourself have come to be the cause of my pain because I've given the word to my Lord this morning have you given one day have you one day given your word to God I don't hear not one amen I have um here I am when you're close to death makes you speak when they're almost about to throw you in the heart everything's okay your nail doesn't even know why am I gonna go to church what am I going to go do at church there's a bunch of sick people at church well where else are the sick people going to be then at church the sick people need a doctor yeah sometimes we don't want to come to church because it's filled with hypocrites when you do this you show me that you're poor in spirit you're fighting with the brothers amen amen let's just be be aware of what we speak watch what we say destination sometimes we misinterpret predestination and brother Brandon says this is the message where I think Pentecost failed now in verse 5 the word predestinances it's not a good for a good word as it kind of confuses people when you see predestined predestinence speaks looks back to foreknowledge and for knowledge how could God predestine someone it is yours he's God he knows what choice you were going to make today in this day the beginnings and the end that you were gonna you're gonna you're gonna hate it how is it that he could have hated and how could he have loved Jacob you're gonna choose him you're gonna choose him I'm just going on the surface and he says in other words God didn't say look I'll make this man be this is not make this man be that you choose you choose don't trust your your instinct that says oh God already progesterated Destiny in my life if God predestined you then you're going to keep my daughter you're going to March because you're going to be the example how with your life to the hole sometimes we're good at preaching what about my children what about my wife if your wife doesn't support you then what imagine Brothers wouldn't be the way she is God bless them wherever they are they say yes he had to know the beginning and the end so because he knew beforehand he could say this will happen in this other will happen because it was God he knew where everything would be placed certain things for certain ages do you believe that is that's certainly scriptural wow wow and don't says so then don't just stay seated on the bench Brothers I know that the bench is very comfortable and I know that being a leader is not easy it's not easy because one has to keep moving forward anyone has to put the example you have to put the example and that's where things begin to tie up that's when things begin to tighten up foreign later no brothers and when we get to church we don't say anything we're quiet no you don't know God help us Brothers I believe I believe we're Christians here yeah on the streets and wherever we're at look Brothers I believe you and I have to come to this condition that the people that they'll be able to see us there is a disciple of Jesus that's what I believe we haven't been able to do that yet we're going to keep working now we're still alive we're not we're not here you make a decision you're going to take um then he came going to a place where we had to make another decision Abraham when you put yourself in those situations remember we're talking about restoring the family okay they say and it says he said then he came to a place where he had to make another decision and that decision foreign or whether he was going to trust God's judgment because she looks like she has a long skirt on maybe she's all covered up look this is what he said he didn't do that physical he didn't say that he is if she gives me the drink and my camels brothers so look he said he said not me that's the key Lord you made that decision a brand new car you choose as well after coming to the door to the gate of the city was he going to try and take his own intelligence to try and choose perhaps the most suitable wife for his wife of his Masters or was he going to use his own judgments could you go into town and look around and find the most attractive would be the best for him and I think Eliezer made a great decision when he said that he would trust God wait a minute look Brothers he wasn't just giving any any job any task to fulfille was given a very special job in this last time this last days William Marion Branham elvino and he came to choose a bride to prepare a bride yes that's why I don't take it lightly to come here the Sons and Daughters of God now here's the detail here's the thing you choose if you're going to be a son or a daughter of God or or if you're not going to be any of that at all stop blaming God so much it must as a matter of fact let's let's stop blaming the devil too it's true Brothers how many are whips did you not fall asleep did you fall asleep on me look Brothers this is what God placed on my heart look at your condition don't do it again change we want results different results doing the same decisions making the same choices the same dumb things we did and we want different results it's not going to work that way if it hasn't worked for you and try another strategy We Stand Brothers of what was spoken it wasn't the words it was your word [Music] to choose make the right choice you decide foreign help me choose my wife [Music] thank you for my wife Lord because she helps me hey she sacrifices herself sometimes I want to be with my children but you've called us to something I've chosen Lord chosen the harder the hard work just as you
