[Music] man because he has the power of transformation [Music] we're so happy to be here we just pray that we're just asking you pray for us this morning let's let's go straight to the word open our bubbles in the book of Saint John chapter 14. we read the verse 13 too in my Saint John Chapter 14 verse 13 to verse 20. foreign that's better all right the Bible says and whatsoever you shall ask my name that will I do it that that the father may be glorified in the sun it does if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments now verse 16 uh from verse 16 to verse 20 that's uh really what we'll be talking about this morning and the Bible says that and I will pray the father and you shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever [Music] amen so if you read this scripture alone you will think like there is three different people you'll see that Jesus was talking to them who was the son of who was the son of God well ask the father who is another person and the father will send you a comforter who is also another person so this you know this when you read this without any understanding of the Prophet that's what you will think that those three different people in God Amen so now in verse 17 that Jesus continues and he says that even the spirit of Truth whom the word cannot receive because it seeth him not neither nor was him uh so now here Jesus now he's clarifying what he said in verse 16 he says that but you know him for he dwelleth with you is amen here Jesus is talking about the present tense he dwells with you so he's dwelling with you right now the spirit of the truth and then he said that and that same Spirit of the truth that is dwelling with you shall be in you it is talking about that comforter and I will and I will not leave you comfortless and I will come with you I will come to you amen now he's no longer talking about the father but he's using the personal pronoun I is meaning that the father Son and the Holy Spirit it's all one God now verse verse 19 the Bible says that he had a little while and the word seeth me no more by ye see me because I leave and you shall live also University [Music] at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you soon [Music] amen that's the perfect Fellowship this is Lord just to say thank you foreign Lord we pray father God that you help us Lord and you speak to us Lord me as a man Lord I don't know anything I might try to understand is scripture but if you if you are not in there though Jesus is just nothing components why Lord Jesus I pray father Lord that you take me out of the way Lord and you speak to your people put your balance on purpose Lord I just want to be father God the way that you will use father God to speak to us this morning Lord I just want to be a vessel that you would use this morning so that's why I pray for the Lord that you helped me to be so sensible to the holy spirit so that I can say exactly what you want me to say this is exactly thank you for everything Lord those who are looking for the Holy Spirit Lord let's just pray father God that you fill them up those who have needs of Father God that just pray for the Lord that you be their providers Lord in everything father Wanna Give You Thank uh this morning for um this morning I have a we have a little subject that we wanted to share with you is entirely I will be with you even in you amen it's a word that Jesus himself used in the Bible I'm trying to find the verse where I used it but I can't find he said that I will be with you even in you amen if we can read again the uh John Chapter 14 verse 16 to 20. and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because he seeth him not now either knoweth him but ye know him for he dwells with you and shall be in you know and I will not leave your comfort lives I will come to you amen that's a great that's a that's a great promise to lean once you know that Jesus will never leave us alone he will always be with us he had a little while and the world seeth me no more by ye see me because I live and you shall live also [Music] at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you amen I will not leave you amen you will be with me inside I will be inside of you leading you and taking control of your body that's a promise that we can lean once we can't put all all our strength in that promise all our hopes in that promise to know that God will never leave us it doesn't matter how dark the day is that in the Old Testament God gave that promise to all of to uh uh the prophets and all the the Warriors amen he gave that promise to Moses that Moses I will be with you if you're reading Exodus chapter 3 verse 11 or 12. Moses talking with God when God was telling him to go back to Egypt now verse 11 of chapter three the Bible says that and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go on to pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt versions [Music] amen Moses look at himself as a human person as a human being amen he looked at his abilities lord I can't even talk properly Lord I Fleet when when Pharaoh want to kill the man and Pharaoh try to kill me Lord I ran away so who am I to go back again to go back but before that pharaoh and take your people out of Egypt so now verse 12 the Bible said certainly I will be with thee and and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt You Shall Serve God upon this mountain twice Amen in other words Moses is not by your strengths but I will be there with you amen I will be with thee in every step of the way I will always be there amen when you feel the troubles when You Face difficult time call on to me I will be there when Pharaoh would try to kill you you just call call upon me and then I will be there man you just call out my name and I will be there because I am the one giving you the promise foreign I'll always be with me foreign well I meant to people that was crazy amen they've never heard about a flood before those instruments and they went up there and they're trying to check you know how the weather is I mean everything was fine wishing that there is a flood that's coming amen no one knew exactly what he was preaching because he heard it directly from the Lord but those people they thought that that was a bunch of nonsense message well there is nothing I mean we never even seen even a rain if it's never been raining or anything like that yeah but now you're talking about the flood foreign food were different uh someone who has been emptied out is representing uh uh someone who the Ezekiel talks about in chapter uh uh 36 verse 26. amen that would represent somebody with a new heart and a new spirit amen that would represent somebody that God has given him a new heart and a new spirit amen because a new heart and a new spirit but the prophet says that one Ezekiel talked about that if that wasn't the holy spirit amen there was only a spirit that was in order for you to become pliable by God Amen in order for you to become easily maneuvered by God for word because you will notice that God told Noah to pitch their word from within to within and without that's good because in itself that would wouldn't do the work amen so no I had to pitch the prophet here it says that in the message the ark chapter uh paragraph 89 it says he said that that is the believer once in the hands of God got down from from his own self-righteousness of the tree amen he becomes pliable in the hands of the builders with every wind of Doctrine is pliable that fits right into the word of God to be used easily amen that is that wood that God that is why God chose their wood Amen to show that amen that he had to feel their wood with that that that pitch he had to pitch it amen and you notice that how God told Noah to build the ark it was three different levels amen the first one second and the third the community amen and then he told him to make a window that was the only window in the ark is that Montage amen that was on top of the Ark amen God didn't tell him to put the window up in the side of the Ark Junior Batman God never showed him to put that window in front of the ark or in the back of the Ark Junior part Monte foreign those were animals living in those two levels amen but Noah and his family was on the third level amen they were living there but I mean there in the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and then on top of them that window was there letting the light of the Lord shine a Christian amen that you have to go through those steps amen you have to go through sanctification you have to reach the baptism on the holy amen and the light of the Lord will shine upon you and the God Amen who was with them in the Old Testament amen God will come and start living inside of you you're going to give his promise that I will be with you amen will be living inside of you amen that God will be living inside of you amen the prophet say that that's the church see The Church Must empty it must empty yourself out amen is the message the comforter chapter paragraph 73 to 74. amen he says that that is the church it is see The Church Must empty itself out and get real and get real light become labor lights amen get all the denomination out of out of you salty get all the world out of you get all the unbelief out of you and get away amen and then he says that and there was another it is which was different from us that was cut down in his young life amen and and he was bruised and beaten a man wounded for our transgressions for our iniquities he was beaten until life of him poured out like the rose and out of a tree man he was beaten amen he was being Amen to keep us United amen that's Jesus prayers amen that is Jesus Will for us amen so that we can be one even so that we can have the same Fellowship that he had with the father amen you see me you see the father you want us to become like that so that we can go and say that if you see me you see Jesus the prophet says that the God who was with the word who was with them in the Old Testament has now been made flesh amen has dwelled Among Us amen that word that was with Abraham amen that word that spoke to Abraham that word that told Abraham to get out of his father's house know what to build in New York now that word that was with Moses that told Moses that I will be with you and that word I told Joshua that I will be with you Gideon not to fear because I will fight your battles the word that was in the beginning amen and that word has dwelt Among Us people were able to shake the word's hands people were able to eat with the word the word went to Lazarus amen the word gave him life amen the word went to the sick people the sun is God's attributes being manifested attributes amen that is Jesus Christ [Music] that word is using up our feet amen their word is using our eyes you can only see with our eyes he can only touch with our hands he can only walk with our feet amen because that word is now living inside of us that word has called us is amen the bride is the word of God manifested Amen the bride is the word of God manifested Amen as Jesus was the attribute of God being manifested he comes amen the word now the bride now is his word being manifested amen Jesus in you amen he makes you his word being manifested and what is the word manifested amen the word manifested amen it's like Jesus said it's how God says amen he said that you are the light amen you are the light the prophet comes and he says he said that the light is the word of God being manifested amen when God spoke the word amen and that word was manifested amen and that is the bride this is amen you in him amen you become one with him amen you become one with him amen he is the word amen so you being one with him amen you also be his will you also become the word and you also use the word notice that when God created uh the first and when God created Adam and Eve in the spirit but when God created them before becoming this body walking on Earth foreign spiritual he was inside of what's created in Adam the deaf spirituality amen by now when she became a byproduct when when when God when God created when God made them flesh because she was taken from Adam but in Christ they are one amen in Christ they are one amen so is you and getting crushed you are one with him because he dwells in you amen because he is in you amen making you one with him as he was the one with the father I mean he was that voice that Abraham heard this is the voice that Moses heard it is it was their comfort he will look at how the the first person who came before him lived amen you will notice that this this Prophet believe in the word of God and then this is how God this is how God was was dealing with him I agree amen he will see that but Joshua will come amen he will have his example as Moses will be his example you will know that we will notice that Moses was with the Moses had the word of God Amen he lived with that word amen he trusted that word he had faith on that word amen and God never left him to him Joshua was a comfort to him and to know that as long as I keep this word amen God will always be with me the Lord has done for him What the Lord Has Done through him so he noticed that there is no other God but God himself he's the most powerful God divided things out of nowhere else there was able to to testify about it amen he said that there is nobody like our God tell me who's Welcome to our God great things he has done for us yeah man who is like him yeah the song says that I search all over but I found no one I search all over hey man I found no one no one can be compared like our God nobody can be compared to our God he's the only one who can save a sinner he's the only one who can break all the other chains he's the only one who can clean you from from all from from all your scenes he's the only one a man who can give you the peace he's the only one who can give you rest he's the only God there is no other God like him people throughout the ages they try to use O Lord glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders who is amen he says that thou stretches thou stretches out thy right hand it is Led forth thy people which thou has redeemed about them is guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation amen who is among gods family among the gods family Drew Moses was living in a country where people worshiped so many gods the head god of the sun is God of nature god of beauty amen all type of God Amen Moses was raised in that Court [Music] Moses was raised right there for 40 years movies amen they told him that Yemen he had to be taught about all those Gods amen he knew exactly all those so-called gods were he's going to say exactly amen but when he came by but Moses only knew uh the god of Israel just wasn't her mother I mean his mother was telling him remember when Moses came in contact with that God that true God foreign [Music] you are fearful in Praises you do wonders glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises that's why when the cross when they went to Jericho that woman was able to testify said family I think it was rare happy I mean she told Joshua we have heard what your God has done with you amen we have heard all the Wonders that your God has done fear your God Amen people here fear the name of your God Amen he is very fearful in Praises [Music] doing wonders glorious in Holiness amen that's our God Amen that was himself [Music] [Music] [Music] he was with Elijah he Departed the Jordans that little boy who was dead that was only god with them when they were going to battles they had to make sure that they they had the ark with them and the Ark was with them amen and there was able to do all those things and all their enemies and the Philistines and all those people all others uh uh Nations they knew exactly who God was they knew how powerful God was with him let's become flesh it has become flesh sufficient and dwelt Among Us amen we've seen how Jesus was amen we've seen what Jesus has done meaning that we have to do the same works that he did significance meaning that we have to be victorious as he was Victorious now God is now God is inside of us Amen in other words God has merged with us amen he has become me amen he has taken my body amen now he's using my hands and now he's using my feet now he's using my entire body meant to do his works so now tell me who can be against us because then he that is in the world is he that is in you know who is that he that is in you amen is Jesus Christ himself amen amen then he that is in the world then he that is in the world amen amen that's why the prophet preached that that sermon I think it's a great his greatest he that is showing how great was the god that was in them brother Books use that example me when I was down in my iron sin amen and raise me up to make me a Christian if God could take me when I was perplexed and distressed [Music] amen and it was in the condition I was in it a miserable wretch um Amen to give me the hope of eternal life and to baptize me with the Holy Ghost amen and to fill me with his power and Glory then he is able to take me through the valley of shadow of death and receive me into glory on the other side because he promised it the prophet says that that's our comfort the prophet amen if the God who saved me when I was down deep in sin still don't appreciate amen he reached out his hand and stood and saved me amen he cleansed me amen he made me pure wide and wider than snow um amen if that God did that for me amen he gave me the power the hope of eternal life amen I know that that God is able to take me through the valley of shadow of death you won't be afraid of them [Music] amen he was able to hear his name that is the proof of our marriage to him amen certificate of our marriage to him he hasn't written our names down amen and that Lamb's Book of Life amen those names were written before the foundation of the world so there is no days where I became the Son of God there is no days that shows that word that this is when I became the son yeah amen because I was already in him amen I was already in here amen I wasn't him before the foundation of the world Amen I was a son in him before the foundation of manifestation I wasn't I was his word manifested in him amen before the foundation of the world so do not be afraid you just go to him and ask for it Monday amen he's the one who gave that promise it is I will be with you amen he says that is the same God would work with them now he says if I look at how the life of Peter changed when God starts dwelling inside of him amen Peter was afraid amen Peter denied Christ remember after receiving the holy spirit amen after going through that experience of the Holy Spirit experience [Music] was able to walk down the street amen and see that beggar amen who couldn't walk amen who was asking for money amen Peter with the boldness of the holy spirit in him was able to say silver and money silver and gold that I have not he is amen what did he have yes amen he had God inside amen what did he have amen he had that faith in God Amen that faith that could be transmitted said you the transmission and that's what Peter gave to that man whatever why because Peter was in the upper room who had an experience with God able to meet him personally was able to know him personally yeah Jesus Christ us who was dwelling with us amen now he's living inside of us so I have no so I cannot be afraid because he's living inside so the church we have to stop being artificial amen we have to stop being an artificial Christianity remember we have to receive that true genuine spirit of God that genuine baptism of the holy spirit amen we have to stop being artificial amen we have to stop pretending amen we have to stop acting as if we know we have we have been filled with the holy spirit will notice it meant that we have received him amen now it's no longer a time of guessing amen amen the prophet says here in the marriage of the Lamb paragraph 90. he said that that's the way the churches are it is too many today he said that we're just taking the name of the Christian church when it's artificial we're not connected with Christ in any way like an artificial and artificial uh tooth and some come in artificial artificial arm in um artificial eye artificial it's something that's artificial voice if we're just putting it on well you can't put on Christianity amen but you've got to be connected with it amen he has to become you and you have to become him and you have to be one with him amen you have to be connected with him it's not something that we just put on it's not just a name that we tried to bear that we tried to put on on us amen so that people can know that he calls himself a Christian he called himself a message believer I call himself whatever name you want to call him it's not something that we just put on that we just can take and then put it on first but you have to be connected with it amen and there is only one way to be connected with it into her her his own Spirit Crystal injectori his own life Savi and the Bible said that the Bible said to Adam and Eve the Bible said to Adam and Eve that you're no longer Twain and when the woman he lost girl at Farmer Church degrees is married to Christ so Maria Cristo they are no longer two they are one crust in you amen that's it his life has been brought into you soon then you become the bride yeah then you become the bride Allah when his life is no longer too but you won um amen you connected to him amen your thoughts become I mean he start become yours and the father says amen amen because that was what he was thinking and Adam was able to express it yeah don't think about the Elixir why because they became one because there were one in constant Fellowship amen so when you become one with him even his thoughts becomes your thoughts your word become his thought being spoken amen because you are with him directly amen you are not one with him visit the comforter he's here the comforter has come the consulate and he wants to be in you but you have to let him in the comforter is here the consulator the comforter is come the consulate Revenue amen look at what he did in the Old Testament amen look at what he did with Jesus amen look at what he did with all the prophets amen now he's coming come on now he's come now he's here and he wants to be in you he is like Martha when went to Mary she said Mary Ella Marie the master has come and call USD amen the master is already here you made the comforter he's already here it's not the future promise that he's coming amen but he's already here amen he failed the people in the upper room amen he failed the people when Paul was preaching is [Music] he failed the people with the Holy Spirit when brother Brendan was praying amen he filled me with his holy spirit amen meaning that the comforter is here the comforter is present the consulate the comforter he's even here Among Us right now and he's calling for him amen he's calling even you have to let him in you have to open your doors you have to open your door and let him here and then he wants to fellowship with you and then he wants to dwell in you is remembering that with the last age the Church of Lao La auditions amen Revelation chapter 3 the Bible says that Jesus has been kicked out of the church amen he's outside knocking at the door trying to come back inside but not to a church but to the individuals outside what is your door your heart he's knocking he's rap he wants to dwell in your heart he wants to fill you up with his spirits and he wants to fill you up with his holy spirit amen he wants you to become his arm is he wants you to become his mouth he wants you to become his eyes that's why he's knocking at the door that's what constantly he's telling you to open your door that's why constantly he's telling you to let him in because he wants to fellowship with you basketball he wants to Fellowship in you remember we have to open that Mary after she heard that call from from Martha president the Bible said that she stood up and went to meet the master Italia so you have to stand up and go no he says that I don't want to leave you comfortless because you should probably say often but I will be with you even in you because I leave you shall leave us amen that's the promise that that's a promise that I always have with me because I leave you shall leave us because I live you shall live also amen he gave those promises for a purpose not in vain that he spoke all those words meaning that he wanted to be in US amen so we have to stop being artificial artificial remember we have to be connected amen remember in Isaiah I think chapter five where I Brazil talks about those five women that that will go to one man and party and dancing worthless songs I can't be here watching pornography or all kinds of dirty stuff it doesn't constrain you I just want to be called by your name is Sunday and when people will see me there with my bubble under my arms and go to church and sit down on the Pew College amen that's what many Christians have done this is what many message Believers have done we just want to be in the message well we because we believe in the message and whatever reason they say but people are not having that experience of the Holy Spirit experience amen people are not able to tell you about the experience that they have received important person his dad and his parents prayed foreign foreign Corinthians chapter 13. amen here he says though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I have become a sounding brass and our thinking tinkling symbolism and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains I have not charity I have nothing so it doesn't matter you can be praying for sick people and those people will recover you can be praying foreign but if you don't have chair already if you don't have love if you don't have Christopher ma'am you know it's all nothing amen those are good things I mean you feeling praying for the sick and moving mountains and since but it's not the primary thing amen remember the prophet says that if you ask me to choose between having all the gifts that's named in the Bible is only having love without all the gifts I will choose love amen because Love Is God himself and I know that as long as I have him inside of it I will fear no evil because you will always be with me because he said that Creator is he that is in you then he that is in the world Amen so if you examine yourself this morning and you find out that you don't have the Holy Spirit that you don't have God inside of you that you have never met him but you've never had that experience with him hey man I'm here to tell you that if comforter he's here the comforter has come you consulate the revenue and he wants to be with you he wants to be in you amen don't wait until the doors will be closed amen don't wait like those foolish virgins but you have to be ready before the time comes before the pressure comes even if you examine yourself and you look at yourself you say well I don't have the Holy Spirit that brother Isaac is talking I know for certain that I don't have him inside of me amen God is here jutc the comforter has come the consulate and he's willing to fill us with this spirit amen he wants to dwell in US I mean he wants to Tabernacle in us so you just come and ask him hello be honest with him he may confess all your sins amen and ask him Lord I need you inside of me Lord I want you to dwell in me and he will give that promise amen he will make sure that that promise is without promise is fulfilled but you have to be honest with him you have to be sincere with sincere amen you have to confess your sin first you may tell him all about it you don't have to be so fancy about it you just be honest and express yourself to him Lord I've wandered so far away
