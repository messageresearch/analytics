[0:00] and made
[0:02] me. Let's have a word of prayer. Dear
[0:05] gracious heavenly father,
[0:07] we are each standing here today, Lord,
[0:10] and I believe that we could testify
[0:12] that somewhere that you have touched us
[0:16] and that something has happened to us,
[0:18] Lord, where at one time we were in
[0:21] darkness, Lord, you have brought us into
[0:23] the light of God. And we are so happy,
[0:25] Lord, for your grace and your mercy that
[0:28] has been bestowed upon us. And as we are
[0:31] gathered here in the house of the Lord,
[0:33] many prayers have already gone up, but
[0:36] we ask once again, Lord, that the
[0:38] liberty of the Holy Spirit would be here
[0:41] and that every hindering spirit would be
[0:43] bound and that we would be drawn closer
[0:45] to you. And Father God, that your will
[0:48] would be done in our hearts and lives.
[0:50] that on that day, Lord, we would stand
[0:52] before you ready, Lord Jesus, to enter
[0:54] into the kingdom of God. So, heavenly
[0:57] father, we commit ourselves to you, Lord
[1:00] Jesus. And we ask, Father, that you
[1:02] would just forgive us of every sin,
[1:04] every failure, all of our shortcomings,
[1:07] everything that we are, Lord, that you
[1:09] may be merciful and forgive us, Jesus.
[1:12] Hallelujah, Lord. And I pray, Lord, you
[1:14] move this man out of the way. you step
[1:15] in Lord speak to our hearts once again
[1:18] as the scripture is written I can do
[1:20] nothing Lord without you so we praise
[1:24] your wonderful name continue to bless
[1:26] the pastor here and the work here Lord
[1:28] in De Moines and pray father god that uh
[1:30] your righteousness would prevail Lord
[1:32] throughout this city in this area we
[1:35] give you the praise and the glory in the
[1:37] name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior
[1:39] we pray amen glory to the name of Jesus
[1:43] glory to God I'm going to ask you to
[1:45] open your Bibles to Judges chapter 2 if
[1:48] you would please. Greet you in the name
[1:50] of the Lord uh
[1:53] uh
[1:55] from Lorraine and the people the
[1:58] believers that are are there. And uh we
[2:02] were supposed to I had a brother coming
[2:04] in to have uh services with us uh uh
[2:08] last night and uh this morning. And I
[2:10] was kind of in question yesterday what
[2:13] was going to take place because there in
[2:15] Ohio I guess it's a bit like De Moines's
[2:17] here that March is unpredictable. You
[2:20] have no idea what is going to happen and
[2:23] we had a uh I was watching the weather
[2:25] reports during the week and uh sure
[2:29] enough there's a storm in the area and
[2:32] uh it hit yesterday but I guess they
[2:34] were able to have the meeting yesterday.
[2:35] I was wondering whether was going to
[2:37] have to cancel it or not, but I
[2:40] understand they had the had the meeting
[2:41] and the presence of God was there and
[2:45] right about this time they're starting
[2:46] the meeting there. So, we're kind of at
[2:48] the both of us are right at the same
[2:50] time having having our service.
[2:53] Praise the Lord. But the Lord has been
[2:55] very good to us there and speaking to
[2:57] our hearts. And uh we want to share a
[3:00] few things with you here this morning.
[3:02] And reading here in Judges chapter 2, we
[3:06] want to read begin reading in verse 13.
[3:10] And we'll read down to verse 18.
[3:15] And they forsook the Lord and serve Baal
[3:18] and Asharod.
[3:20] And the anger of the Lord was hot
[3:22] against Israel. And he delivered them
[3:25] into the hands. And I want you to read
[3:27] closely. Many times, friends, when
[3:30] people read the Bible, they they kind of
[3:33] read it, but they don't really read it.
[3:36] They don't absorb it. Absorb what we're
[3:39] reading. You should always learn. You
[3:41] should learn to be like a sponge and
[3:44] just absorb everything that the Lord
[3:46] has. Just take your time. Don't let
[3:48] anything go past you. If you don't know
[3:50] that word, I wonder what that word
[3:52] means. Let me look that word up. And
[3:53] you'll find out God will speak to you.
[3:56] And it says, "And the anger of the Lord
[3:58] was hot against uh Israel, and he
[4:00] delivered them into the hands of the
[4:03] spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold
[4:06] them into the hands of their enemies
[4:09] roundout, so that they could not any
[4:13] longer stand before their enemies.
[4:16] Whethersoever they went out, the hand of
[4:19] the Lord was against them for evil, as
[4:23] the Lord had said, and as the Lord had
[4:25] sworn unto them, and they were greatly
[4:28] distressed. So, I don't think it's good
[4:30] to have God have his turn his hand
[4:32] against us. If he turns his hand against
[4:35] us, we're in trouble. Yes, sir. They
[4:37] were uh Nevertheless, the Lord raised up
[4:40] judges which delivered them out of the
[4:42] hand of those that spoiled them. And yet
[4:45] they were not uh and yet uh they would
[4:48] not hearken un unto their judges. But
[4:51] they went and whoring after other gods
[4:53] and bowed themselves unto them. They
[4:56] turned quickly out of the way which
[4:58] their fathers walked in, obeying the
[5:01] commandments uh uh of the the Lord, but
[5:04] they did not sow. And when the Lord
[5:07] raised them up judges, then the Lord was
[5:09] with the judge and delivered them out of
[5:12] the hands of their enemies all the days
[5:14] of of the judge. For it repented
[5:18] it repented the Lord because of their
[5:21] groanings
[5:23] by reason of them that oppressed them
[5:25] and vexed them. Let's read that portion
[5:27] again. For it repented the Lord because
[5:31] of their groanings by reason of them
[5:33] that oppressed them and vexed them.
[5:36] May the Lord bless his word. You may be
[5:37] seated.
[5:43] I want to talk to you for just a couple
[5:44] of minutes before we get right into the
[5:46] the sermon.
[5:48] As I've said, I just appreciate uh
[5:52] Brother Isaiah's uh invitation to come
[5:55] and speak to you here for just a little
[5:58] while. And I've known Brother Isaiah for
[6:01] for many years, and I've appreciated his
[6:03] spirit actually. what I have seen and
[6:06] I'm really no judge of uh anything but
[6:10] from my point of view you got a very
[6:12] good pastor here and a man who really
[6:15] loves the Lord uh the things that I have
[6:18] God has dealt with me about we have set
[6:20] and discussed and come to we were
[6:22] talking about things yesterday and
[6:23] coming to see that uh the things that
[6:26] the Lord has dealt with me about God has
[6:29] dealt with him the same way and they're
[6:30] just lining up and uh I know personally
[6:34] personally that things that the Lord has
[6:36] taught me about the gospel, uh, I know
[6:39] it come from the Lord. Person might say,
[6:42] "Well, you're under some influence." I
[6:43] got news for you. I'm not under any
[6:45] influence other than the Holy Spirit. I
[6:48] I follow his leadership and what he has
[6:51] for me. Men may come and they may
[6:53] present something, but I will take it
[6:55] and I'll take it before the Lord and see
[6:57] whether it's right or wrong. Amen. And
[6:59] uh people today in this uh hour that
[7:02] we're living in, people are are serving
[7:04] the Lord and serving uh God in what we
[7:06] call in the ranks of this message. But
[7:09] I'm coming to find out that uh in this
[7:12] last few years, I'm beginning to realize
[7:15] that people don't really know the
[7:18] purpose of why
[7:22] uh we're here, why we're in this age,
[7:25] why the age what it is, why we have
[7:27] so-called the message. And we talk about
[7:29] a prophet has come. But people don't
[7:32] understand many things about what is
[7:35] really going on. What is the what is the
[7:37] purpose? What is the purpose of being
[7:40] here? What is the purpose of being in
[7:42] church? There has to be a purpose for
[7:45] for everything. You see, God doesn't do
[7:48] anything without a purpose. That's the
[7:50] reason why uh many times in our distress
[7:53] and thing trials of life, we find out we
[7:56] get uh very troubled. We don't know why
[7:59] these things are happening. Why is this
[8:01] happening? Why? But if you read your
[8:03] Bible, the Bible says and you really
[8:05] love God and it says all things are are
[8:08] are uh are for the good to those that
[8:11] are called according to his purpose.
[8:13] There is a purpose that is going on in
[8:16] your life. Well, what is it? Well,
[8:18] that's not your business.
[8:20] That portion is not your business. Your
[8:23] business is just to serve the Lord.
[8:25] Amen. And so, as we're walking along and
[8:28] I could say, "How long have you been
[8:30] walking with the Lord?" Well, I've been
[8:31] walking with the Lord for a year. How
[8:34] about you? Well, I've been 10 years.
[8:35] Another one 15, 20, 25, whatever amount
[8:39] of time that might be. And uh I could
[8:42] ask you, what are your goals in your
[8:45] goals in your life for your walk with
[8:47] God? What what are are you interested in
[8:51] to accomplish? Well, I don't know. To
[8:54] serve the Lord. Well, what does that
[8:55] mean? What does it mean to serve the
[8:57] Lord? and and and people don't know the
[9:01] answers to these things. They're they're
[9:03] actually simple basic answers. What is
[9:06] your what is your goal? If I if you uh
[9:09] were uh if you left your house and I ask
[9:12] you, where are you going? And you said,
[9:14] well, I'm going to go out to to some
[9:16] stores and I will say, well, what's your
[9:19] purpose? Why are you going? You you will
[9:21] you will right away name off, I'm going
[9:24] to see about getting this and this and
[9:26] this. When you leave your house, you
[9:28] already got a goal. You got a purpose.
[9:30] You got something laid out. And in
[9:32] walking with the Lord, we don't just
[9:34] walk blindly. Amen. We got to have a
[9:38] purpose of where we're going. What What
[9:39] are we doing? You know, that's one of
[9:42] the questions that comes back to me in
[9:44] this day with people that are serving
[9:45] the Lord. What are you doing?
[9:48] What are you doing? You know, they
[9:51] they're they they start out on their
[9:52] journey and go, you know, and they make
[9:54] a turn this way, then they're back over
[9:55] this way and they're going, "What are
[9:57] you doing?"
[9:59] And when you talk to, "Well, I love the
[10:02] Lord." That don't mean anything.
[10:04] That means nothing. There'll be a lot of
[10:06] people in hell that says, "I love God."
[10:10] Because they they don't know what love
[10:11] is. People talk about love today. I
[10:15] remember I preached a message many years
[10:17] ago uh uh on on the subject of love and
[10:21] I with it I brought out that how that
[10:24] many people the the world believes they
[10:27] know something about love and very few
[10:30] people know anything about love.
[10:34] They know they they know very little
[10:36] about love.
[10:38] You see the thing of it is to to
[10:40] actually know love you have to know
[10:42] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[10:44] You you can't know love in any other way
[10:47] other than knowing Jesus Christ.
[10:50] All the rest of it is all a carnal love.
[10:52] And it's it's relevant. You you love
[10:55] somebody today. Tomorrow you may not
[10:56] love them. You know it it's flexible.
[10:59] It's relevant. It depends on situation.
[11:02] Well, I thought I love them. I can't
[11:03] stand that person now. Well, what what
[11:04] happened?
[11:07] My Bible tells me love doesn't change.
[11:11] It's constant. It's not on
[11:13] circumstances. You see, and and people
[11:16] say, "Well, I love God." Well, the Bible
[11:18] says, "If you love God, keep my
[11:20] commandments." Why aren't you ser Why
[11:22] aren't you serving the Lord? Well, you
[11:24] know, I got these cir circumstance.
[11:26] Well, don't tell me you love God because
[11:28] you don't. Amen. See, people don't know
[11:32] what love is. They don't know what their
[11:34] purpose is. the we talk about I in in
[11:39] ministers ministers themselves they're
[11:41] going around oh praise the Lord for what
[11:43] God has done in this day God has sent a
[11:46] light in this day I say brother uh uh I
[11:49] said what what is the purpose that it
[11:50] come well to lead his people where to
[11:53] what well to the rapture or to what does
[11:56] that mean well what do you mean what
[11:58] does it mean to the rapture what does
[11:59] that mean
[12:02] well the catching away what does that
[12:05] And they're going to ask me, "Are you
[12:06] dense? Is something wrong with your
[12:08] head? You know, don't you understand
[12:10] it?" No, there's something more to this.
[12:12] Amen.
[12:14] I There's something more to this.
[12:18] Amen. Praise the Lord. Because this this
[12:21] catching away, you know, I used to think
[12:23] years ago, I thought the rapture
[12:25] consisted of uh just the Lord is going
[12:27] to come and bam, you know, we're gone.
[12:29] Well, that's part of it. Amen. There's
[12:32] more to it than this. Amen. Amen.
[12:35] There's more to this. Thessalonians says
[12:38] uh Thessalonians says he shall descend
[12:41] with He shall This is scripture. I'm
[12:44] just quoting scripture now. He shall
[12:46] descend with a shout.
[12:50] A voice and a trump a trumpet. He shall
[12:54] come with all three of these. A shout.
[12:58] Amen. There's a shout that goes out.
[13:00] Matthew 25, we read there that uh in
[13:02] Matthew 25 when uh uh with the five wise
[13:05] and the five foolish virgins, it says,
[13:07] "At the midnight hour,
[13:10] at the closing of the day, there was a
[13:12] cry that went out." Amen.
[13:17] You know the verse of scripture. Amen.
[13:18] Good. Then I'm not going to turn to it,
[13:21] but in that verse of scripture in our
[13:23] King James Bible, it says, "Behold, the
[13:26] bridegroom cometh.
[13:29] Is that right?
[13:31] Do you know in the Greek in the Greek it
[13:34] doesn't say the bridegroom cometh. It
[13:36] says behold the bridegroom.
[13:43] That's right. In the original that the
[13:45] translators put cometh in there. In the
[13:49] original it doesn't say cometh. It says
[13:51] behold the bridegroom.
[13:54] He's present among his people. Yes, sir.
[13:56] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. He's present
[13:59] among you. He's present here.
[14:03] We're sitting here today. We think we're
[14:04] just gathered together. Let me tell you
[14:06] something. Like I told my church, you're
[14:08] not in your house.
[14:15] Listen, saints, let the baby cry. I'm a
[14:18] pastor.
[14:20] I'm going to tell you, I'm not going to
[14:22] pastor you, but I'm going to tell you,
[14:23] leave the baby cry. Don't worry about
[14:25] the baby. You say it. Keep your
[14:26] attention up here. Amen.
[14:29] Amen. You see,
[14:32] they they Jesus is here. He's here right
[14:36] now. This is his house.
[14:41] He said, "When you come into my house,
[14:43] it should be a house of prayer." Amen.
[14:46] Amen.
[14:47] And I told the my church at home, what
[14:50] if I would have come to your house and I
[14:51] I come in and I sat down and they said,
[14:53] "Brother Randy, you know, it's good to
[14:55] have you here,
[14:58] Brother Randy. You know, uh, you know, I
[15:00] it's good to have you here.
[15:04] Uh, Brother Randy, would you like a cup
[15:05] of coffee?"
[15:10] Now, if it was your house, what would
[15:11] you feel like if I did that to you?
[15:15] You wouldn't you wouldn't appreciate it.
[15:18] Brother, you won't talk to me. Why won't
[15:20] you talk to me?
[15:22] I don't feel like talking.
[15:25] Well, you're in my house. Amen. Oh, I'm
[15:28] in your house. So, I'm in your house.
[15:30] That means I'm expected to talk to you.
[15:34] Well, you're in God's house. Amen.
[15:37] And you're expected to talk to him.
[15:40] You're not expected to sleep. Amen.
[15:44] You're not expected just to sit there
[15:46] and warm a seat.
[15:48] When you're in his house, he invites you
[15:51] to come for certain reasons. You're here
[15:54] for a purpose.
[15:56] There's a purpose of being here. Amen. A
[15:59] purpose is is to lift up his name.
[16:02] It's to magnify him. G for us to be
[16:05] attentive and listen to the word of God.
[16:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. And so therefore,
[16:12] when we are there, when we are here, we
[16:14] come in and we're just sitting there
[16:18] and God's looking at you in his house.
[16:20] You dare to come into my house and sit
[16:23] here like this? What kind of attitude
[16:26] have you got?
[16:28] You're in my house. I invited you. I
[16:31] called you from the darkness and you
[16:33] come and sat in my house and act like
[16:35] this.
[16:38] Lord
[16:40] purpose.
[16:43] What does God want out of us? Well, we
[16:46] we we must live the life of Christ. How
[16:48] are you going to do that? How you going
[16:50] to do that?
[16:52] You know, uh the Bible says uh uh Jesus
[16:56] was asked the question, what is the
[16:57] greatest commandment? And he said, "Love
[16:59] the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
[17:00] mind, and soul." And the second is
[17:02] likened unto the first to love thy
[17:04] brother uh as thyself. Love thy Lord thy
[17:07] God with all thy heart, mind and soul.
[17:10] So people what they do to all the
[17:11] Christianity is to love your brother. We
[17:13] got to love one another. Love one
[17:14] another. You can't love one another.
[17:19] You can't love one another. Not until
[17:22] you fulfill the first commandment.
[17:26] You can't do it. It won't work. All you
[17:28] got is a bunch of carnal love. A
[17:31] formality is all you got. Amen. Me
[17:34] coming into your house and sit down and
[17:35] talk with you and have coffee and pizza
[17:37] and whatever, that's not love. That's
[17:39] not fellowship.
[17:41] That's friendship, worldly friendship.
[17:43] But that's not fellowship. Amen.
[17:46] But when I can walk up to a brother and
[17:48] just five minutes chat with him and just
[17:50] feel that spirit, we are having
[17:52] fellowship. Hallelujah. Just five
[17:55] minutes. I walk away and say, "Oh, I
[17:56] enjoy talking with that brother." You
[17:58] only talk with him five minutes. Oh, but
[17:59] what I got in that five minutes Glory
[18:03] purpose.
[18:05] People don't understand purpose of of
[18:08] this Christian one. Do you know that the
[18:11] Bible says you are a peculiar people?
[18:14] You know that I I read that scripture
[18:17] and I got to thinking about that word
[18:19] peculiar. I thought, well, I think I
[18:21] know what it means. That means odd,
[18:23] strange. But I was surprised when I
[18:26] looked up the word. The word actually
[18:28] means a treasure enclosed,
[18:35] a treasure. You are a treasure enclosed,
[18:39] sealed up. Amen. And God is calling you
[18:43] a treasure.
[18:46] And the reason why you're a treasure
[18:48] because you're the only people on the
[18:50] face of the earth that will believe his
[18:52] word the way that you do. Amen. Thank
[18:56] you, Lord. You see, when Mary when that
[18:59] angel came to Mary and talked with Mary,
[19:03] you see, he he said to her, "You're
[19:06] going to have a child." She immediately
[19:08] said she knew the order of life. I have
[19:11] not been with a man. He said, "That
[19:14] don't make any difference. You're still
[19:15] going to have a child. You're going to
[19:17] have a child without being a man." And
[19:19] she agreed to it.
[19:22] Now, let me ask you, why should she
[19:23] believe a message like that?
[19:26] Tell me one reason. It's completely
[19:30] against science. It's against nature.
[19:33] It's against everything that man has
[19:35] taught. It doesn't even make sense.
[19:39] Amen.
[19:40] And she believes it.
[19:44] Why should she believe that? You know,
[19:46] this message today that we have does not
[19:49] make sense to the world.
[19:51] Why do you believe it?
[19:55] Why do you believe it? Amen.
[19:58] You know there on the day of Pentecost
[19:59] when the Holy Ghost came they said why
[20:02] is it that we understand these people
[20:05] who are speaking a different language
[20:07] but somehow we understand it
[20:11] and it's the same way with us when we
[20:13] come in contact with this gospel it's a
[20:15] different language it's a different
[20:17] message and we say how is it that clicks
[20:20] with me how do how do I understand this
[20:23] thank you Lord
[20:26] you see it. God God has uh made us his
[20:32] treasure.
[20:34] We are the the believers of the true
[20:37] believers. Now, I'm not saying believers
[20:40] of of the general message. All Israel is
[20:43] not Israel. I'm sorry.
[20:47] But the true believer is a treasure in
[20:50] the sight of God
[20:53] because they will believe in the Lord.
[20:55] They will hold to his word and they know
[20:57] anything anything is possible. Amen.
[21:01] Anything for you. Yeah, I believe
[21:02] anything's possible. Oh, really? You
[21:04] really believe anything's possible? Then
[21:07] look at yourself
[21:09] and look at the impossibilities about
[21:11] ourselves.
[21:13] Look at ourselves and say, you know, cuz
[21:15] I believe everyone, if that includes me,
[21:17] we look at ourselves. I think, man, this
[21:19] is one hopeless case. Anybody would be
[21:22] honest and say, I see that about myself.
[21:24] Is that right?
[21:27] This is one hopeless case. I'm sure God
[21:30] I I hope God can do something with this.
[21:33] Hallelujah.
[21:35] But you see, you get to a place, my God
[21:37] can do anything. Amen. God can even take
[21:40] this. I have more faith in you. I have
[21:45] more faith that God can do something
[21:46] with you than he can with this.
[21:49] Isn't that true? Amen. But now, let's
[21:52] get down to the impossibility. That's
[21:54] right here.
[21:55] God can do the impossible.
[21:58] God can take this vessel and change it
[22:01] into what he wants it to be.
[22:05] What's the purpose of God? People don't
[22:08] know know the purpose.
[22:11] There's so much that I could say. I I
[22:14] brought my case and I told brother
[22:16] Isaiah, of course, we known each other
[22:17] for a long time. And I said, I I said, I
[22:20] have so much so many so much uh uh
[22:23] amount in in my sermon, I had to bring
[22:25] my whole case just to bring my notes.
[22:27] And he said, bring it on, brother. I
[22:29] said, oh, okay.
[22:32] Didn't shake him up.
[22:35] But there are so many things that the
[22:37] Lord had been dealing with my heart
[22:39] about in the last few years. And one of
[22:42] the one of the great things is is about
[22:44] the purpose of God. What God wants in
[22:47] our life. It's like we're here this
[22:50] morning. We're not here just because
[22:52] it's Sunday morning. Some people go to
[22:54] church because it's Sunday morning. But
[22:55] this is not the purpose.
[22:58] See, this is a place where God speaks.
[23:01] Amen. Amen. I believe he does. I know
[23:04] your pastor. I know God speaks for me. I
[23:06] know he has spoke in our church and we
[23:08] just about went through the ceiling
[23:11] and we just had a wonderful time time in
[23:13] in the Lord and I've uh I've known
[23:16] brother his ministry for many years. I
[23:18] know God uses this man and this is a
[23:21] place that God speaks speaks to the
[23:24] people. I have told some some of the
[23:26] people in my area says well you know you
[23:29] didn't come to church the other day. I
[23:30] said uh but you missed out what God had.
[23:33] He said, "Well, yeah, I understand
[23:34] brother and son." No, no, no. You you
[23:36] you don't understand. God went to church
[23:38] that day. He was there waiting on you
[23:42] and you disappointed him. Amen. You
[23:45] disappointed. He wanted to talk to you
[23:47] that day and the only way you were going
[23:49] to hear him, you had to come to the
[23:51] church and you refused to come. You
[23:53] disappointed him that day.
[23:56] See purpose. When we come to the house
[23:58] of God, I come to get you. every one of
[24:01] you sitting here, you know, we might sit
[24:03] here and maybe I I don't know, I'm just
[24:05] going to give an analogy here that maybe
[24:08] you just take what I had today and just
[24:09] kind of blow it off. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[24:11] Right, Brother Andy. But I'll tell you
[24:12] what, you'll give more you'll give honor
[24:14] to that uh car that you drive because
[24:17] when it gets down the road and it starts
[24:18] to run out of gas, you run to the gas
[24:20] station.
[24:23] You always make sure you got gas in
[24:25] there. And then we come to the house of
[24:27] the Lord, you're just getting filled up
[24:29] just a little bit more.
[24:31] Sometimes we got a quarter tank or a
[24:32] half a tank. I think I'm going to go get
[24:34] some gas anyway.
[24:36] We come to church. Well, I'm pretty well
[24:38] half. I'm 3/4ers full. I'm praising the
[24:40] Lord. Well, that's good. Let's fill it
[24:42] up a little bit more. Hallelujah.
[24:45] Well, brother, I got a full tank today.
[24:47] Well, let's let it run over.
[24:53] Let's let run over. See, it's coming to
[24:55] the house of God. There's a purpose that
[24:58] is here. There's a purpose in this
[25:00] message that we have in this day. Uh let
[25:03] me uh let me just touch on this and
[25:04] we're getting close. We're going to get
[25:06] right into the into the message here.
[25:08] But uh I haven't been with you for a
[25:10] while. I just I just had it in my heart.
[25:11] It just I this thought just kept coming.
[25:14] Talk to them for a few minutes. Talk to
[25:15] them for a few. So that's what I'm
[25:17] doing. But you you see there in this in
[25:21] this day that God had has sent this
[25:23] message. People think that uh this
[25:26] message is a a very special message and
[25:28] in a sense it is uh that that we have
[25:32] and that God had given us this message
[25:35] and people walk around praise the Lord.
[25:37] Glory to God. We are the bride of Jesus
[25:39] Christ and we have this message today.
[25:42] I'm thankful for it also. I am very much
[25:45] thankful for it. But let's go back to
[25:48] purpose. What is the purpose that God
[25:50] gave us this message?
[25:53] I won't go too deep in this, but I'm
[25:55] just going to hit you hit something
[25:56] here. The only way you would get through
[25:59] this age, you have to have this message.
[26:02] Now, did you hear what I said? You have
[26:04] to have this message.
[26:07] Now, in all of the other six ages, God
[26:11] gave them what they needed.
[26:15] They got what they needed.
[26:17] And we didn't get this get this in this
[26:20] age because we're just so blessed. You
[26:22] need this message. Amen. Why? Because
[26:27] this is the last age. This is the only
[26:30] age that Christ is put on the outside.
[26:33] This is the only age that there is a
[26:35] deception
[26:37] that will deceive the very elect if it's
[26:40] possible. And this is the only age that
[26:43] 200,000,000
[26:45] horsemen, demons that are released on
[26:47] the face of the earth, Amen. And it
[26:50] brought a destruction to the Jew Jews.
[26:52] It brought a destruction to the
[26:53] denominations. And it's been turned
[26:55] loose on the bride of Jesus Christ.
[26:58] 200,000,000
[27:00] demons. Now tell me how you're going to
[27:02] resist 200,000,000 demons. You're not
[27:06] going to do it. But God said something
[27:09] to set you free.
[27:14] We needed this message.
[27:17] It had nothing to do with where, oh,
[27:20] we're just so blessed and we're special
[27:21] people. No, I needed this message.
[27:29] That's the only thing, Amen. that will
[27:33] defeat the powers of darkness in this
[27:35] age.
[27:37] Because the Bible said that darkness
[27:39] will deceive the very elect. Let's just
[27:42] leave it like that. It will deceive the
[27:44] very elect.
[27:49] Amen. Well, brother, if it's possible,
[27:51] yes, if it's possible, because God's
[27:53] going to counteract everything the
[27:55] devil's doing. Amen. Amen. Even those
[27:59] four horse rides. See, I'm going to
[28:00] start. I got to slow down here.
[28:05] I start turning open up the faucet.
[28:07] Everything starts spilling out.
[28:10] Those four horse riders, they riding
[28:12] down through the ages. And but you see
[28:15] and people talk about the seven seals.
[28:16] The seven seals. Praise the Lord. You
[28:18] know, God opened up the seven seal.
[28:20] What's the seven seals about? Well, it's
[28:22] about these horse riders and about how
[28:24] there's a white horse, a red horse, a
[28:26] black horse, and the pale horse and and
[28:28] there and what all it's about and so on.
[28:30] That's not the focus.
[28:33] The horse riders are not the focus.
[28:38] The four the the focus is the lion, the
[28:41] ox, the man, and the eagle. That's the
[28:45] focus.
[28:47] Yes, sir. Amen. Because those other
[28:50] those four, those powers were sent out
[28:54] to combat the antichrist.
[28:59] Purpose.
[29:03] preachers get up behind the pope and
[29:04] start throwing out all of these Bible
[29:06] terminologies and and saying different
[29:09] things and these certain uh slogans,
[29:12] these phrases that they put out there.
[29:14] We are the bride. We're the bride. This
[29:17] is the bride age. We are the bride. Tell
[29:20] me a woman that ever gets married, she
[29:23] walks around, I'm a bride. I'm a bride.
[29:26] I'm a bride.
[29:29] She don't say that.
[29:31] Let me tell you about the man I met.
[29:33] Hallelujah.
[29:36] Let me tell you about the man I met. Let
[29:39] me tell you about this one. Amen. He
[29:41] chose me.
[29:43] He chose me. He wants to marry me. I'm
[29:47] going to get married today. He's going
[29:48] to take me as his bride. And not walk
[29:51] around magnifying the bride. The
[29:54] Catholic Church does that. Bring it on.
[29:59] Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.
[30:03] Exactly. Right.
[30:06] You see that thing slipping into the
[30:08] message, that Catholic spirit
[30:11] to magnify the woman. Hallelujah.
[30:15] And it's everywhere.
[30:17] It's spread everywhere. And I'm
[30:20] thinking, what are you doing?
[30:23] The focus is not the bride. The focus is
[30:25] the king, the mighty conqueror.
[30:31] I guess I'm just oldfashioned, I
[30:33] suppose.
[30:36] I've always believed that the king need
[30:37] to be magnified and I I haven't changed
[30:40] my changed the gospel that I believe. I
[30:42] still believe he needs to be magnified
[30:44] today. I believe he should be magnified
[30:47] in our everyday lives here in the
[30:49] church. When you come to church, we're
[30:51] here to pray for the pastor, pray for
[30:54] the meetings, whoever is ministering,
[30:55] pray for the Holy Ghost.
[30:57] sinners that might walk into our midst
[30:59] to pray for backsliders. Backsliders
[31:02] will die right in your midst, too. Amen.
[31:05] I've seen people spiritually die sitting
[31:07] in the church. It's exactly right. Amen.
[31:11] Because they sat there and as the word
[31:14] is coming to lift them up and to mold
[31:17] them, they they're the word is just
[31:20] going right past them. They're not
[31:21] opening up their hearts. We don't want
[31:24] that to happen.
[31:26] You don't want that. Praise the Lord.
[31:30] I obviously you can see that I love the
[31:32] Lord very much and uh there are so many
[31:35] things I was thinking today what can I
[31:37] share with this little group here in the
[31:40] time that we have but looking here in
[31:42] this judges let's go back to here and I
[31:45] want to talk about and we're going to
[31:47] title this today
[31:50] this the sermon which we have is Naomi's
[31:54] return
[31:56] Naomi's return now a lot of times times
[31:59] the the in preaching from the book of
[32:02] Ruth the the the focus many times is on
[32:06] Ruth and uh her return her coming to the
[32:09] land of Israel but our focus today is
[32:13] actually going to be on Naomi and uh
[32:17] bringing it down and bringing that focus
[32:20] down to ourselves.
[32:23] So now when we're sitting and listening
[32:25] to this uh today, I want you just to
[32:28] focus on yourself because you know that
[32:31] the Bible says judgment begins in the
[32:33] house of the Lord. That's another thing
[32:36] to add. This is not only God's house.
[32:38] This is the judgment hall. You are being
[32:40] judged right now. Amen. Being judged.
[32:45] Do you know that when the when the
[32:47] rapture takes place, those that are
[32:49] taken up will not be judged. Amen.
[32:52] Hallelujah.
[32:54] They won't be judged because they've
[32:56] already been judged. Amen.
[33:00] People think, "Well, when we get on the
[33:02] other side, we're going to get to the
[33:03] white throne judgment, and I hope
[33:05] everything will be all right." You're
[33:06] going to the white throne judgment, not
[33:08] me. I'm already at the judgment.
[33:12] I'm already in the judgment. God is
[33:15] judging me by
[33:17] by the word and what is being brought
[33:20] from my life. But looking here in these
[33:23] uh verses of scripture, we see that how
[33:26] that the as we had read there in verse
[33:29] 13, they they forsook the Lord and serve
[33:33] Baal and Ashroth. It goes on to tell how
[33:36] that uh God would send them judges and
[33:40] uh and the the judge would deliver them.
[33:43] I want you to notice very carefully that
[33:46] the judge would come. A judge. Judge is
[33:49] one that comes brings cases before him,
[33:52] judges the rights and the wrongs. You
[33:55] see, uh we don't want to we don't really
[33:58] want to meet God as a judge. We want to
[34:01] meet him as a king. We're we're facing
[34:04] him now as a judge. You know, that you
[34:06] know that you know how you handle the
[34:07] judge. You know how you deal with the
[34:09] judge or when you when you stand before
[34:11] him, just run and fall before him. Said,
[34:13] "Guilty, Lord. Guilty. I'm not even
[34:16] gonna try to plead my case. I'm guilty.
[34:19] Whatever it is, I'm guilty.
[34:22] He'll look
[34:24] right.
[34:25] He likes that. Hallelujah. Praise the
[34:29] Lord. These are judges. And a judge, he
[34:31] will go and he will determine cases.
[34:34] And but notice this judge is also a
[34:37] deliverer because he delivers them from
[34:40] their enemies. Judge. Deliver. Amen.
[34:46] judge, deliver. He's not only a judge,
[34:48] he's also a deliverer. He's a savior. A
[34:52] savior and a judge. Glory to God. So
[34:56] when the when the judge
[34:59] when the judge and I'm going to use
[35:01] switch these terminologies when the
[35:02] judge when the savior would come and the
[35:05] savior the judge would be present. Ah
[35:08] praise the lord. Glory to God. Let's
[35:11] serve the lord. But when the when the
[35:13] judge or the savior made his exit,
[35:18] he's not around now.
[35:20] They went back to their pagan worship.
[35:24] When another judge would come along,
[35:26] they would come back and serve the Lord.
[35:27] And they would do this continually.
[35:31] But I brought you to these verses of
[35:32] scripture because
[35:35] we find out here uh
[35:43] my place here.
[35:46] Yes.
[35:48] And at the end of verse uh or just verse
[35:50] 18, and when the Lord raised them up
[35:52] judges that then the Lord was with the
[35:54] judge and delivered them out of the hand
[35:56] of their enemies all the days of the
[35:58] judge. So they were they were had
[36:00] freedom for it repented the Lord because
[36:04] of their groanings by reason of them
[36:06] that oppressed them and vexed them. Ah
[36:09] they were under uh uh under oppression.
[36:13] The enemy was giving them much
[36:15] difficulty and so therefore listen
[36:18] therefore it caused groaning in them.
[36:22] They begin to groan.
[36:24] You know, one thing you something that
[36:27] this message I'm sorry
[36:31] I hope you I hope you got a spiritual
[36:33] mind and I don't and I don't mean
[36:34] somewhere off and uh off track here but
[36:37] if you got a spiritual mind to
[36:39] understand this message has killed the
[36:42] groans.
[36:45] Am I right, brother brother Brooks?
[36:48] It has killed the groans.
[36:51] And the reason for that is is because
[36:54] that we feel like we have arrived. We
[36:56] feel like we have we have got the best
[36:58] of the best. We feel like we've got it
[37:00] all and we haven't arrived yet.
[37:04] There needs to we need to go back and we
[37:06] need to go have this groaning in our
[37:09] life. And what caused the groanings is
[37:12] the oppression, the enemy.
[37:15] I told the church at home, I said,
[37:17] "Look, you know, you got all kind of
[37:19] trials going on in your life and many
[37:20] times you feel absolutely miserable.
[37:23] Hands are going up. Yeah. Yeah. Amen.
[37:24] You feel like you just want to get out
[37:26] of this world. Amen. Praise the Lord. I
[37:28] said, "Do you know why? Do you know why
[37:30] you're miserable? God wants you
[37:32] miserable." Amen.
[37:36] Well, my church went quiet on me. I
[37:38] said, "God wants you miserable because
[37:41] if you're happy, you're going to want to
[37:42] stay here. But if you're miserable,
[37:45] you're going to want to say, "God, get
[37:46] me out of this place. I want to leave
[37:49] here."
[37:51] And you're looking for his coming.
[37:53] You're looking for that deliverance.
[37:56] You see the groanings, the groanings
[37:59] have died out. It's faded away. What it
[38:02] is the curse of Leodysia. Rich increase
[38:05] with good. I don't have any need of
[38:08] nothing. Oh, I don't What do I have to
[38:10] groan about? Well, see, let me think
[38:11] about. Oh, man. I guess I could have
[38:13] grown for this. You see, people don't
[38:15] have anything.
[38:17] But when you when you learn when you
[38:20] learn that you wake up in the morning,
[38:22] do you know the Bible says anybody that
[38:25] touches any dead thing must go through a
[38:28] time of purification. Do you remember
[38:30] that in the Bible? It was as I was
[38:33] reading those verses of scripture, I
[38:35] realized I wake up every morning and
[38:38] touch a dead thing. I wake up in this
[38:40] dead carcass and I realize I need the
[38:44] blood of Jesus Christ every day of my
[38:47] life.
[38:49] Amen. Amen. I need him every day of my
[38:53] life. And I realize how great that he
[38:57] is. And if he's going to judge me for
[38:59] what I am, I'm lost.
[39:02] I'm lost.
[39:04] My only hope is his mercy. Amen. So
[39:07] therefore, I've taught I myself and I've
[39:09] taught the church, let's go to the cross
[39:11] and lay at the cross and just groan
[39:13] before him. Lord, I don't want to be me.
[39:16] I want to be like you. Take me, mold me,
[39:19] shape me, do what you got to do with me,
[39:22] Lord. Please, Lord, I want to be more
[39:24] like you.
[39:26] Help me, Lord Jesus. I can't. I've tried
[39:29] to do it myself and I can't do it. I
[39:32] can't do it. I've been serving the Lord
[39:35] for about 40 years now and I find out to
[39:37] this day I still can't do it. I'm a
[39:39] total failure everywhere I look.
[39:42] Amen. But I know he he it's possible for
[39:46] him. He is able. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory
[39:51] to God.
[39:53] Amen.
[39:55] We see here the groanings. This groaning
[39:58] is very important. Let's go to let's go
[40:01] to Romans chapter 8.
[40:10] Romans chapter 8,
[40:20] start with verse 18.
[40:30] For I I reckon that the sufferings There
[40:33] we are. For I reckon that the sufferings
[40:35] of this present time are not worthy to
[40:39] be compared with the glory which shall
[40:42] be revealed in us. For the earnest
[40:46] expectation,
[40:48] the earnest expectation, the great great
[40:52] expectation of the creature, that's us,
[40:55] waitth for the manifestation of the sons
[40:58] of God. For the creature was made
[41:01] subject to vanity, that's this world,
[41:04] not willingly. Did God ever ask you if
[41:07] you wanted to come here?
[41:10] No. It wasn't your will. He just put you
[41:12] here. Amen. He made you subject to this
[41:15] world
[41:18] uh not willingly but by reason of him
[41:22] who has subjected the same.
[41:26] I purposely let off those last two
[41:28] words. He purposely subjected the same.
[41:32] In other words, by his will, by his his
[41:36] purpose, he subjected us. He put us in
[41:39] this world. And it says uh subject to
[41:43] this world, this world of vanity in
[41:46] hope.
[41:48] He gave hope. He put us in a world
[41:51] without hope. But he gave us hope. Amen.
[41:56] Because the creature itself also shall
[41:59] be delivered from the bondage of the
[42:00] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[42:03] the children of God. For we know that
[42:05] the whole creation groanth and travaleth
[42:08] in pain together until now. And not only
[42:11] they but ourselves also which have the
[42:14] first fruits of the spirit. Even we
[42:15] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[42:19] for the adoption. And that is to means
[42:22] that is the redemption of the body. That
[42:26] the adoption is the the redemption or
[42:29] the rapture. For we are saved by hope.
[42:33] But hope that is seen is not hope. For
[42:37] what a man seeth, why does he yet hope
[42:41] for? But if we hope for that we see not,
[42:46] then we do then do we with patience
[42:50] wait.
[42:54] That's something lacking today is
[42:56] patience.
[42:58] Then do we with patience wait for it.
[43:01] Likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[43:04] infirmities. For we know not what we
[43:06] should pray for as we ought, but the
[43:09] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[43:11] with groanings. It makes uh intercession
[43:14] with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[43:17] And he that searchth the hearts knoweth
[43:19] what is the mind of the spirit because
[43:21] he maketh intercession for the saints
[43:23] according to the will of God. So
[43:26] therefore the Bible says that we are
[43:28] groaning. We are groaning. The spirit is
[43:29] groaning right along with us. Brother
[43:32] Brandham mentioned uh uh about groanings
[43:35] and he mentioned that a person that is
[43:37] doing this it is because they have
[43:39] fallen from something. You see when we
[43:42] get sick we don't feel well we start
[43:45] groaning. You have fallen from your
[43:48] health. If you lose a loved one you will
[43:51] groan because you've lost something. You
[43:54] lose your job you will groan because
[43:56] you've lost something. Amen. groanings
[43:58] are are in uh uh in relationship to uh
[44:02] to losing something. We've fallen from
[44:05] something. And it says here that we are
[44:08] groaning, but what we are groaning for
[44:11] uh about is that we have lost our fallen
[44:16] estate. In other words, uh we should be
[44:19] in the uh see the world, let me put it
[44:22] this way, the world is happy out here.
[44:24] They're happy where they're at, but we
[44:26] are growing. What are you growing? I'm
[44:28] not happy in this life. Why you you need
[44:30] a doctor? No, I just need Jesus.
[44:33] Uh God has something greater for me. We
[44:37] have fallen from that. We come into this
[44:40] world. We have been subject to this
[44:42] world. But something in us tells us we
[44:44] were there at one time. Amen.
[44:48] Something tells us we were there at one
[44:50] time. And so therefore, we are groaning.
[44:53] We are groaning uh to to leave this
[44:56] place. We want to be there. Uh people
[44:59] that don't understand the gospel, they
[45:01] would say, "Why would you want to leave?
[45:02] Aren't you happy in this life?" Well, in
[45:04] a sense, yes, for your sake. In a sense,
[45:06] yes, I am happy. But you have no idea. I
[45:09] don't want this world. I I I'm I'm done
[45:12] with this world. What are you going to
[45:13] do? Commit suicide? No, it's not that
[45:15] kind of thing. We're not talking about
[45:16] that. I'm talking about a land that's
[45:19] beyond the river. The land that's just
[45:21] beyond this universe, beyond your How do
[45:24] you know that it exists? Well, something
[45:26] in my heart tells me that it does exist.
[45:28] So, we're groaning, you see, to be in
[45:32] that place. The Bible says we are
[45:33] pilgrims and strangers seeking a city to
[45:36] come. You see, and so therefore, we're
[45:39] not at home. We came from somewhere. The
[45:43] Jesus said, "I came from God and I going
[45:46] back to God." And he was a son of God.
[45:49] We are sons and daughters of God. I came
[45:51] from God and I'm going to go back to
[45:53] God. Amen.
[45:55] See, so this is the reason why the
[45:57] groanings are are taking place. Amen.
[46:00] And this is the re and this is what
[46:02] God's Now now maybe you'll start getting
[46:04] the picture. This is the reason why God
[46:06] is pleased with the groanings
[46:09] because you're groaning to be with him.
[46:13] Not to be satisfied there. And when the
[46:17] when the when the groanings begin to
[46:19] dissolve, he's very troubled.
[46:22] He's very troubled when we come in and
[46:24] just sit in the sit in this in this
[46:26] church and just sit there.
[46:29] He's very disturbed because he wants to
[46:31] hear groaning.
[46:33] He wants to hear pray.
[46:38] I've taught my people I've taught my
[46:39] people at home, it's very important that
[46:42] you participate.
[46:44] For other many people, it is it's just
[46:46] uh uh automatic uh for them, natural for
[46:50] them to respond. and others are very uh
[46:52] uh reserved. But God wants us to to
[46:56] participate and say yes Lord. Don't be
[47:00] afraid. Get your head between you and
[47:01] the Lord. Lord, that's me. That is me,
[47:04] Lord. Open our mouths and say amen.
[47:07] Amen. That's right. See, God is
[47:09] listening. Ah,
[47:12] he likes that.
[47:15] Brother, what makes you say so? Try and
[47:17] find out what happened.
[47:20] Hallelujah.
[47:22] Tell me the Tell me you you tell me if
[47:24] the presence of God doesn't start
[47:26] coming.
[47:27] You find he'll come down just put his
[47:29] arms of love right around you. Oh yeah.
[47:32] That's a sign that appreciates it. Amen.
[47:36] Glory to God.
[47:38] Something something has been lost. You
[47:41] see, there's a deep calling to the deep.
[47:44] Uh something that has been lost. Uh what
[47:47] is it that you're looking for? I don't
[47:48] know. I I I don't know. But you know,
[47:51] Abraham, he was looking for that city.
[47:53] He never did find it
[47:55] until he died and crossed the river.
[47:57] Then he thought, "This is what I've been
[47:59] looking for all along."
[48:02] That's what I've been looking for.
[48:05] Let's go to Isaiah chapter 44.
[48:10] I'm a man that likes to use the Bible
[48:14] very much in going from scripture to
[48:16] scripture to once in a while I will use
[48:19] quotes but I'm not keen on just reading
[48:23] quote after quote after quote after
[48:25] quote after quote I remember that Jesus
[48:28] was talking to his disciples and he said
[48:30] who do men say that I am they gave their
[48:32] well they say you're this they have they
[48:34] have your in their interpretation of the
[48:37] word he said but Who do you say that I
[48:40] am? And Peter didn't say, "Well, let me
[48:43] uh let me first of all, Lord, let me
[48:45] quote you from Isaiah." He said, "No,
[48:46] no, no, no. I didn't ask you that. I
[48:48] didn't ask you that. I already know
[48:49] that. Tell me what you say. I want to
[48:54] know from you." And he didn't want to
[48:56] hear any quotes. He wanted to hear his
[48:58] vision. And when he said, "Thou art the
[49:00] son of the living God." He said, "You've
[49:03] been in communication with the father."
[49:06] And that's what God is expecting out of
[49:08] me. He's not expecting me to come and
[49:10] just give you what somebody else said.
[49:12] He's expecting me to come and give you a
[49:14] vision that I see that is in the gospel.
[49:16] It has to line up with the word. Isaiah
[49:19] 44 21
[49:23] 44
[49:24] 21- 23. And thus sayeth the Lord thy
[49:28] redeemer, and uh he that formed thee
[49:32] from the the womb, I am the Lord that
[49:34] maketh all things, that stretcheth forth
[49:37] the heavens alone, that spreadth uh
[49:39] abroad the earth uh by myself.
[49:43] Uh for excuse me, I I'm reading on 24. I
[49:46] got to go to
[49:49] uh
[49:53] let me get it right here.
[49:55] Uh
[49:57] 4421
[50:00] 23. Sometimes I don't even write the
[50:02] right notes down. It's brother Isaiah
[50:04] was you know your pastor so I guess I
[50:06] can say this a little freely.
[50:09] Sometimes he forgets
[50:12] me I I'm I'm we were talking I'm just as
[50:14] bad sometimes I'll write down the wrong
[50:16] notes and all kinds of things and so
[50:18] I've been working hard recently to try
[50:20] to get it right. Uh verse 21. Remember
[50:24] these uh oh Jacob and Israel, for thou
[50:27] art my servant. I have formed thee. Thou
[50:30] art my servant. Oh Israel, thou shalt
[50:32] not be forgotten of me. I have blotted
[50:36] out as a thick cloud thy transgressions
[50:40] and as a cloud thy sins. Return unto me,
[50:46] for I have redeemed thee. Sing, oh ye
[50:51] heavens, for the Lord hath done it.
[50:54] Shout ye lower parts of the earth. Shout
[50:57] ye lower parts of the earth. Break forth
[51:00] into singing, ye mountains, o forest,
[51:03] and every tree therein. For the Lord
[51:06] hath redeemed Jacob and glorified
[51:09] himself in Israel. Shout, praise the
[51:13] Lord, because he has redeemed us. Amen.
[51:17] He's cleansed us from our sins and our
[51:20] transgressions. He's worthy to be
[51:22] praised. If he never does another thing
[51:25] for me, praise his holy name. I'm no
[51:28] longer in darkness. I am free. I am here
[51:31] to walk with the Lord. Amen. There was a
[51:34] time someone would ask you, "Hey, how
[51:36] about coming to church with me?" I'm
[51:38] not. No, I don't want none of that. But
[51:40] here we are. Just like St. Paul said he
[51:42] was preaching the same gospel that he
[51:44] was uh uh accusing. And here we are
[51:47] sitting here. Something that we thought
[51:49] we would never get involved with. We're
[51:51] here praising the Lord.
[51:54] That's exactly right. Hallelujah. It
[51:56] says here, I have redeemed thee. I have
[51:59] redeemed thee. I have set you free. And
[52:02] he says here, return unto me. I want to
[52:05] focus on that. Return unto me. Come back
[52:09] to me.
[52:13] I believe that's the call of this last
[52:14] day. Church, come back to God. Amen. But
[52:19] I haven't gone anywhere.
[52:21] It's not what we physically do. It's
[52:23] what we spiritually do. Amen.
[52:26] Hallelujah. God is calling us back to
[52:29] him. Amen. Return unto me. You see here,
[52:33] you see how this uh before I go on so I
[52:35] don't get you lost, uh you see how that
[52:37] this begins to tie in. He says, "I have
[52:40] redeemed redeemed you. Uh just praise
[52:43] the name of the Lord. Worship him.
[52:46] Return. Come back to me. If you strayed
[52:48] away, come back." Amen.
[52:52] All you got to do is come back and just
[52:54] come with groanings and repentance and
[52:56] I'll gladly receive you. That's all you
[52:58] got to do. Jeremiah chapter 24.
[53:14] Jeremiah chapter 24
[53:16] verse 4.
[53:19] Again, the word of the Lord came unto
[53:21] me, saying, Lord, thus thus sayeth the
[53:24] Lord,
[53:26] God of Israel,
[53:29] like these good figs, so I so will I
[53:32] acknowledge them that are carried away
[53:36] captive of Judah, whom I have sent out
[53:40] of this place into the land of the
[53:43] Calaldanss for their good. I sent them
[53:46] out into the land of the Calaldanss for
[53:50] their good. For I will set mine eyes
[53:53] upon them for good, and I will bring
[53:56] them again to this land, and I will
[53:59] build them and not pull them down. And I
[54:02] will plant them and not pluck them up.
[54:06] And I will give them a heart to know me.
[54:10] and I am the Lord. And they shall be my
[54:13] people, and I will be their God, for
[54:16] they shall return unto me with their
[54:20] whole heart. Amen. Amen.
[54:25] Purpose.
[54:28] God, what does God want for me? God
[54:30] wants you to come to him with your whole
[54:34] heart. He doesn't want you to come to
[54:37] religion.
[54:39] If I can say this correctly, I don't
[54:41] know if this being recorded, but if it
[54:43] gets out, whatever. God is not wanting
[54:46] you to come to the messia.
[54:49] He wants you to come to him, the living
[54:53] resurrected Jesus Christ.
[54:58] You know in the Bible so many things uh
[55:01] you know in the Bible Jesus uh was
[55:04] talking to the Pharisees
[55:06] and he told them search the scripture.
[55:12] Search the scripture.
[55:15] Go search him out. Search the message
[55:18] out. Search it out. Go ahead. Search the
[55:20] message out. You got the scripture.
[55:24] You've got the message.
[55:27] And you think you have eternal life.
[55:31] You think you have eternal life.
[55:34] He said, "But they testify of me and who
[55:38] is he?"
[55:40] I want you to ask the question, "Who is
[55:42] he?"
[55:44] Who is he? He's the word.
[55:50] Wait a minute. He said, "You got the
[55:52] word.
[55:57] What he's saying to him? You got the
[55:58] word, but you don't have the word.
[56:05] You got the word. You got the message,
[56:08] but you don't have it.
[56:12] You don't have it. Don't tell me I don't
[56:15] have it. I know what happened in this
[56:18] day. I know the hour. I know what the
[56:21] scripture said. Oh, you do. You haven't
[56:22] got it yet.
[56:25] Yeah, that's the words of Jesus.
[56:28] You tell that to people today, they they
[56:31] just about cut your head off.
[56:34] You see, this is the reason why I say
[56:37] come to the message. There's something I
[56:40] I I maintain this. There's something in
[56:43] this message.
[56:46] It's not coming to the message. It's
[56:48] going into the message
[56:51] and things that could go into the book
[56:53] written on the front side and the back
[56:56] side. There's something on the back on
[56:58] the inside on that back side there. When
[57:02] Moses came down out of the mountain, he
[57:03] had the tablets of stone. Do you know it
[57:05] was written on the back side? Read your
[57:07] Bible. It was written on the back side
[57:08] also. There's so this here, let me tell
[57:11] you friend, this here's the front side,
[57:15] but the back side is in between the
[57:16] lines. Amen.
[57:19] You got to see through here to get to
[57:21] the back.
[57:23] And when you get to the get on the
[57:24] inside and see back there, what you see
[57:27] is Christ.
[57:29] Amen. That's what you see. You see the
[57:32] living, resurrected Christ. Brother
[57:34] Brandham said, if you read your Bible,
[57:35] whether it's the Old Testament, New
[57:36] Testament, you don't see Christ, read it
[57:38] again. If you don't see Christ that
[57:40] time, read it again. You're missing
[57:42] something because it's a revelation of
[57:44] Jesus Christ.
[57:48] Exactly. Glory to God. Hallelujah. So,
[57:53] glory. They shall return.
[57:57] They're going to come back, but when
[58:00] they come back, they'll come back with
[58:01] their whole heart.
[58:04] Let's go to Malachi chapter 3.
[58:09] This is speaking speaking of Israel, but
[58:13] it par parallels
[58:17] It parallels the children of God even in
[58:19] this day. Malachi chapter 3.
[58:22] Now, most people would say, "Oh, he's
[58:25] going to talk about talk about the
[58:27] prophet of this day." No, I'm not going
[58:29] to that right now. Malachi chapter 3
[58:34] and verses 6 and 7.
[58:41] For I am the Lord, I change not.
[58:45] Therefore, ye sons of Jacob are not
[58:48] consumed.
[58:52] We need to just stop right here and fall
[58:55] on our faces before God.
[58:59] I am the Lord.
[59:01] That's the reason why you are not
[59:03] consumed.
[59:05] I have not consumed you yet.
[59:09] Glory to God. Oh, what a wonderful verse
[59:11] of script. I am the Lord. I change not.
[59:15] Therefore, ye sons of Jacob are not
[59:19] consumed. Amen.
[59:21] Even from the days of your fathers,
[59:25] you are gone away from my
[59:30] from my ordinances, and I have not that
[59:34] and have not kept them. Return unto me,
[59:37] and I will return unto you, sayaeth the
[59:40] Lord of hosts. But ye said, wherein
[59:43] shall we return? What? Return to what?
[59:49] Why?
[59:51] That's what's happening today. It's a
[59:54] restoration. Returning back. A
[59:56] restoration message. Return to what?
[59:59] What? What do we Oh, return to the word.
[1:00:01] The word. The re word has been restored
[1:00:03] to us. The word was never changed. It's
[1:00:06] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:00:08] We're the ones who left. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:12] Amen. I am the Lord.
[1:00:16] I am the Lord. I changed not. Therefore,
[1:00:19] you were not consumed as of your fathers
[1:00:21] have done. You've always gone astray
[1:00:24] from me. Return back to me. This is the
[1:00:28] closing of the Old Testament. God was so
[1:00:32] upset with them, he didn't talk to them
[1:00:34] for 400 years.
[1:00:38] There wasn't even a move of God. From
[1:00:40] Malachi, you turn a couple pages and you
[1:00:42] get to Matthew, there's 400 years in
[1:00:45] between there.
[1:00:47] There was not one prophet. There was not
[1:00:49] one move of God. God just sat back on
[1:00:52] his throne. Okay, you can just sit there
[1:00:54] for 400 years. I'm not talking to you.
[1:00:57] And finally he said, "All right, I'm
[1:01:00] going to come to you one more time. Just
[1:01:03] one more time." Hallelujah. And he came
[1:01:05] to his own and his own received him not.
[1:01:08] Amen.
[1:01:09] This time he came down bodily and walked
[1:01:13] among them. Amen. Amen. Willing to throw
[1:01:16] his arms around them and they rejected
[1:01:19] him.
[1:01:21] Hallelujah.
[1:01:23] Return unto me.
[1:01:27] Praise the Lord. I've already lost track
[1:01:30] of time. I I'm sorry. I'm I'm up here
[1:01:32] somewhere and I I've lost track of time.
[1:01:36] Amen. Let's go to the book of Ruth.
[1:01:42] Ruth chapter 1.
[1:01:46] This is the last scripture that I have
[1:01:48] for you, but we're going to spend a
[1:01:49] little time with this.
[1:02:09] Luke chapter 1, we'll just read verses
[1:02:11] 1-9.
[1:02:15] And it came to pass in the days when the
[1:02:17] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[1:02:20] the land. And a certain man of beth
[1:02:22] Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the
[1:02:24] country of Moab. He and his wife and his
[1:02:27] two do two sons. And the name of the man
[1:02:30] was uh uh and the name of his wife uh
[1:02:34] Naomi. And the name of his two sons
[1:02:37] Melon and Chilon Ephrathites Beth
[1:02:41] Bethlehem Judah. And they came into the
[1:02:44] country of Moab and uh continued there.
[1:02:47] and uh Almc Naomi's husband died and she
[1:02:50] was left and her two sons and they took
[1:02:53] them wives of uh women of Bo the name of
[1:02:56] the one was Orpa and the other uh name
[1:03:00] of uh excuse me the name of the other uh
[1:03:03] Ruth and they dwelt there 10 years they
[1:03:06] were there 10 years and Melon and Chilon
[1:03:08] died also
[1:03:10] both of them and the women was left of
[1:03:13] her two sons and her husband
[1:03:16] And she arose and she arose her
[1:03:19] daughter's-in-law
[1:03:21] uh that uh that she might return. Then
[1:03:25] she arose with her daughtersin-law that
[1:03:27] she might return from the country of
[1:03:30] Moab. Now get this. Then she arose with
[1:03:33] her daughters-in-laws that she might
[1:03:35] return from the country of Moab. For she
[1:03:38] had heard in the country of Moab, how
[1:03:40] that the Lord had visited the people in
[1:03:43] giving them bread. Giving them bread.
[1:03:46] Wherefore she went forth out of the
[1:03:48] place where she was, and her two
[1:03:50] daughters-in-law uh with her, and they
[1:03:53] went on their way to return unto the
[1:03:55] land of Judah. And Naomi said unto her
[1:03:58] two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each
[1:04:02] to her mother's house.
[1:04:05] Go return each to her mother's house.
[1:04:08] The Lord deal kindly with you as ye have
[1:04:10] dealt with with the dead and with me.
[1:04:13] The Lord grant you, the Lord grant you
[1:04:16] that you may find rest
[1:04:20] each of you in the house of her husband.
[1:04:23] Then she kissed them and they lifted up
[1:04:26] their voice and and and wept.
[1:04:30] We see here, we see here that uh Naomi
[1:04:35] is in the in the land of Moab. And the
[1:04:38] reason why that they are there is
[1:04:42] because uh Naomi and her husband had
[1:04:44] been living in the land of Israel and a
[1:04:46] famine had come. And the laws of God is
[1:04:49] never leave the land. Stay there. If you
[1:04:53] remember the uh Elijah went to the
[1:04:55] widow, there was a famine going on.
[1:04:57] There was no food. But God provided for
[1:05:00] this widow. Amen. They She didn't have
[1:05:02] to leave the land. Only thing she did,
[1:05:05] she believed the prophet's message
[1:05:09] and God took care of her. Now, that
[1:05:11] message that he had was strange. Give me
[1:05:14] your bread and you'll have have plenty.
[1:05:18] And she she could have said, "Well, how
[1:05:20] is this going to happen?" She didn't
[1:05:21] argue. Says, "All right." And as she
[1:05:24] obeyed
[1:05:25] uh this strange message, then God had
[1:05:28] supplied the need. So God has always
[1:05:31] instructed never leave the land. Stay in
[1:05:35] the land. Well, Naomi and her husband,
[1:05:38] they felt like I need to do something.
[1:05:41] We need to do something. Like the kids
[1:05:43] are the boys are going to starve. Uh we
[1:05:45] need to do something. So they made the
[1:05:47] decision and they left the land of
[1:05:48] Israel and they uh went to Moab. And so
[1:05:53] while they are there in Moab, they are
[1:05:55] there for 10 years. The husband first of
[1:05:57] all dies and then uh the boys marry as
[1:05:59] we see and then the two boys die. Now
[1:06:02] you have to take a look and see that
[1:06:05] this woman's heart now this woman's
[1:06:08] heart is broken. She's lost her husband.
[1:06:11] She's lost her husband and especially
[1:06:13] she's lost her boys. Even if she didn't
[1:06:15] like her husband, uh she she lost her
[1:06:18] two boys. I see that she lost her
[1:06:21] husband and two boys. She's a very
[1:06:22] devastated woman. She's feeling very
[1:06:24] lonely now. And but now you see she had
[1:06:29] had been in the land of Israel. This is
[1:06:32] a very important point. She had been in
[1:06:35] the land of Israel. She has something to
[1:06:39] relate to, something former,
[1:06:44] something former that is there laying in
[1:06:47] her. She had been in the land of Israel.
[1:06:52] So now the reason why she left her and
[1:06:55] her husband justified that well we're
[1:06:59] only thing we're doing is supplying for
[1:07:01] our family. Many times people who are
[1:07:03] walking with God they justify
[1:07:05] themselves. You cannot justify yourself.
[1:07:07] Not when it comes to God. When God said
[1:07:10] trust in him, it meant trust in him.
[1:07:12] Well, we just done this because forget
[1:07:14] your excuses.
[1:07:16] Forget it. We got to learn to serve God
[1:07:18] with all of our hearts. Amen. Well, I
[1:07:21] didn't go to church because of this. You
[1:07:23] know, I was tired the other day and this
[1:07:25] happened and that happened. I remember
[1:07:26] in the days of brother Brandham when
[1:07:28] that when the God was moving so strongly
[1:07:30] in those days, people said, "Put me in
[1:07:32] an ambulance. Put me on a stretcher. Get
[1:07:34] me to the church. Let that preacher pray
[1:07:36] for me. I know I'll be healed." You
[1:07:38] don't see faith like that today. You
[1:07:41] don't see faith like that today. Not
[1:07:43] only that, as it was in the uh uh in the
[1:07:46] days of the disciples when uh uh Peter
[1:07:48] was called to uh um
[1:07:52] uh
[1:07:53] I'm trying to think of that man's name.
[1:07:55] He was called to that uh the that house
[1:07:58] and the Holy Ghost was poured out. Uh
[1:08:03] where is Cornelius? Thank you, brother.
[1:08:06] Once in a while I'll I'll open up to let
[1:08:08] somebody answer. Help me out here. uh
[1:08:10] Cornelius uh when he was went to
[1:08:12] Cornelius's house
[1:08:15] uh they the power of God got God got
[1:08:18] fell as
[1:08:20] the word of God they received the Holy
[1:08:22] Ghost as
[1:08:25] the word was being preached
[1:08:28] as brother brother uh when was the last
[1:08:31] time you seen somebody receive the Holy
[1:08:33] Ghost as the word was being preached? It
[1:08:36] been a year since I've seen that happen.
[1:08:42] Why
[1:08:44] those people believe the scripture
[1:08:48] that word becomes so alive to them and
[1:08:50] bam, God poured out his spirit and
[1:08:53] filled them with the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:56] Yes, sir. We have become so
[1:08:58] carnalminded.
[1:09:00] We've become so I don't even know the
[1:09:03] words that to use. I'll make up a word.
[1:09:05] church aside. Uh we we we become so
[1:09:09] involved with church and going to church
[1:09:11] and praise the Lord, we forget what the
[1:09:14] whole purpose of this whole thing is.
[1:09:16] The purpose is that God would open the
[1:09:18] windows of heaven and pour out himself
[1:09:22] into our lives.
[1:09:26] Oh, brother, I'm not that kind of
[1:09:27] person. Then, all right, I'll meet you
[1:09:29] at the judgment or I'll meet you in the
[1:09:31] rapture. we, you know, the showdown is
[1:09:35] coming. I'm not here to say you're
[1:09:37] right, I'm wrong, or I'm right, you're
[1:09:39] wrong, or I I whatever it is. I'm not
[1:09:41] here to do any of that kind of stuff. I
[1:09:43] know there's a rapture going to take
[1:09:45] place, and every one of us got to get
[1:09:47] ready. Amen. Naomi, she was in this
[1:09:49] land. She She had She had previous
[1:09:52] experience. She's got something in her
[1:09:55] that's pulling her back to the land of
[1:09:57] Israel. The Bible says she had heard a
[1:10:00] message had come to her that there's
[1:10:03] bread in the land of Israel. In other
[1:10:05] words, before the rains had not been
[1:10:08] falling. It was a famine. The rains had
[1:10:11] not been falling. The Holy Ghost had not
[1:10:13] been falling and the land had dried up.
[1:10:17] So, brother, excuse me. It's time for me
[1:10:19] to go to another church because uh the
[1:10:22] the the land has dried up. I'm going to
[1:10:24] go to another church. Don't leave the
[1:10:26] land. Amen. Amen. But it's dried up.
[1:10:30] Don't leave the land. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:10:35] Well, brother, I don't like the problems
[1:10:36] that's going on in the church. I don't
[1:10:37] like this going on. I don't like that.
[1:10:39] Don't leave the land. Stay where you're
[1:10:41] at.
[1:10:43] You don't get any more of God changing
[1:10:45] your address.
[1:10:48] Well, I changed my address. I'm sorry,
[1:10:50] brother. And I and I believe I'll get
[1:10:51] more of God. You You're not going to get
[1:10:53] any more of God because God is
[1:10:55] everywhere. Amen. He's here. He's there.
[1:10:58] It's your heart. Amen. Why not just
[1:11:00] admit it? You're backslid.
[1:11:05] Hallelujah. I'm talking about cases at
[1:11:08] home. I'm not talking about here. You're
[1:11:10] backslid. That's what the real problem
[1:11:12] is. And they got all these issues that
[1:11:14] they put their finger on. That's what
[1:11:16] Naomi and her husband did. They put
[1:11:17] their finger on. The land is dry. We
[1:11:19] have to We have to survive. We have to
[1:11:21] go to the land of Moab. Uh-huh. You look
[1:11:23] what happened. You lost your husband.
[1:11:24] you lost lost your two sons.
[1:11:28] Look here. Amen. Very quickly, uh her
[1:11:31] husband uh Alimc that means almighty or
[1:11:35] great king.
[1:11:38] She's married to almighty great king.
[1:11:43] Her son Melon melon means sick,
[1:11:48] worn, weak.
[1:11:51] Chilon means pining, pining away. get
[1:11:54] thinning down, pining, destruction,
[1:11:57] failing.
[1:12:01] So look at the end results. Lost her
[1:12:03] husband, lost her two sons.
[1:12:08] She's married. What a sad case to be
[1:12:10] married. Now, let me just use it in
[1:12:13] types. What a sad case to be married to
[1:12:15] a king and become sick, weakly, pining
[1:12:19] away, destructive, failing.
[1:12:25] Ruth or Naomi, what are you doing in
[1:12:28] this condition?
[1:12:29] What are you doing in the land of Moab?
[1:12:32] Well, I love the Lord. You're backslid.
[1:12:36] You got no business in Moab.
[1:12:40] Are you happy here? Not anymore.
[1:12:44] Oh, not anymore. Why? I lost my husband.
[1:12:48] I lost my children.
[1:12:51] Sure. Now you're losing everything. Now
[1:12:53] you're starting to groan again.
[1:12:57] Now you're groaning. Oh Lord, look at my
[1:13:00] condition. Look at where I'm at. Look
[1:13:02] what's happened. Yes. It's because you
[1:13:04] are backsliding. You left the land.
[1:13:09] That's what your problem is.
[1:13:12] And so she made up her mind. She made a
[1:13:15] decision.
[1:13:17] No more. Amen.
[1:13:20] I don't want to live in Moab anymore.
[1:13:22] Amen.
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:26] I think that's what we need to make a
[1:13:29] decision in this day. I don't want to
[1:13:31] live in Moab anymore.
[1:13:34] I have heard that the rains are falling
[1:13:37] in Israel.
[1:13:39] The Holy Ghost is falling. And I'm tired
[1:13:41] of living without a move of God.
[1:13:45] I don't want to stay here anymore.
[1:13:48] I want to leave this place. I want to
[1:13:51] get back where the blessings. I want to
[1:13:53] get back to that place in my life where
[1:13:56] the blessings are falling. I want to get
[1:13:59] back to where I in touch with God. Where
[1:14:03] I feel that intimacy with him and I know
[1:14:06] him in that personal way.
[1:14:09] Amen. It has nothing to do with my
[1:14:11] daughter-in-laws. It has nothing to do
[1:14:13] with anyone else. I want to go back to
[1:14:16] the land of Israel. Amen. Nobody has
[1:14:19] tried to persuade me. I'm sticking with
[1:14:20] Naomi. And nobody has persuaded me, but
[1:14:23] something is in me. Something is in me
[1:14:26] pulling me. I can't take it anymore.
[1:14:30] I've lived here too long. I've lived
[1:14:32] here too long. I don't know if they
[1:14:35] would want me back there anymore, but I
[1:14:37] I got to go back. I got to go back to
[1:14:40] the land of Israel. Hallelujah. She
[1:14:43] makes up her mind and she starts making
[1:14:45] preparation. She starts packing her
[1:14:47] things. Mom, where you going? I'm
[1:14:49] leaving. Where you going? I'm going back
[1:14:51] to the land of Israel. And uh she said,
[1:14:54] "Well, why don't you stay here? Stay
[1:14:56] here. You know, you've lived here for 10
[1:14:58] years now. Why don't you stay here? I
[1:15:00] I'm not happy here anymore. I cannot
[1:15:02] live in this place anymore. I'm done. I
[1:15:05] got to return back." Amen.
[1:15:09] Hallelujah. This message is to call
[1:15:13] the children of God back.
[1:15:17] Amen. Not to go to something, but to
[1:15:20] call them back to something.
[1:15:24] Hallelujah. Glory to God. There's
[1:15:26] something inside. A deep calling says,
[1:15:29] "I know. When I heard that voice, I know
[1:15:32] exactly what it meant. Yes, I got to go
[1:15:35] back." Amen. Hallelujah. She told her
[1:15:38] daughters, you read it. Amen. She told
[1:15:40] her daughters, if you can find rest
[1:15:42] here, stay.
[1:15:46] If you can, if you can sit there in your
[1:15:48] seat here in this meeting today and just

[1:16:26] she starts to take off and here comes
[1:16:28] Ruth right along with her. Look, I told
[1:16:30] you. Go on back to your family. Go on
[1:16:32] back. She' I'm not going back. She went

[1:17:36] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] Here they are traveling together.
[1:17:42] Amen. Hallelujah. So Ruth Naomi comes
[1:17:47] back in the land. When she comes back
[1:17:48] into the land, she gets back into those
[1:17:51] meetings.
[1:17:52] Oh.
[1:17:54] Oh. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:56] I've been gone away from this so long.
[1:17:59] I'm so happy to be back in the land.
[1:18:01] Uhhuh.
[1:18:03] Uh-huh. That time of being out there so
[1:18:05] cold
[1:18:07] and out there in the world. Now you
[1:18:09] appreciate appreciate being back here,
[1:18:11] don't you? Oh, I appreciate being back
[1:18:13] here. Beware, the devil take you right
[1:18:15] back out again. Get yourself anchored in
[1:18:18] Jesus Christ.
[1:18:21] Hallelujah. You're fighting demon
[1:18:23] powers.
[1:18:25] Amen. The next issue would come along,
[1:18:27] you're going to try to reason it out and
[1:18:29] go right back out again. Hallelujah. But
[1:18:32] then Naomi or Ruth when she came in.
[1:18:35] Hallelujah. She came in into the land.
[1:18:39] There she is gleaning in the field. Boy,
[1:18:40] I said you just stay here in this field.
[1:18:43] And she says, "All right, thank you.
[1:18:45] Stay in this field. Don't leave. Stay in
[1:18:49] this field." He was watching her. He
[1:18:52] says, "Who is this woman?"
[1:18:55] And they said, "Don't you know this is
[1:18:57] the Moabitete woman? She gave up
[1:18:59] everything. She left her family. She
[1:19:01] left her land. She left her friends. She
[1:19:04] left the church back home. Whatever she
[1:19:06] was in, whether it was a whatever
[1:19:07] organization it was in, she left all of
[1:19:09] that back home. And she came here to be
[1:19:12] among us.
[1:19:13] She did.
[1:19:16] He kept watching her. Hallelujah.
[1:19:18] Because she gave up everything.
[1:19:21] She gave up everything. And that one
[1:19:24] became his wife.
[1:19:27] That one became his wife.
[1:19:30] Why? Because she learned as she was on
[1:19:33] this journey and she came into this
[1:19:34] land, she realized that this land is a
[1:19:37] special land.
[1:19:39] This land is an anointed land.
[1:19:43] This land is a chosen land.
[1:19:48] And she was glad to sit there in that
[1:19:51] land. She was glad to sit there in that
[1:19:54] field and be gleaning in that field.
[1:19:57] Hallelujah. Don't go into another field.
[1:20:01] Stay right here and just keep gleaning
[1:20:03] in this field. Because when you're going
[1:20:04] along and you're gleaning, you don't
[1:20:06] always find something to eat. Well, I
[1:20:09] looked and look. I didn't find anything
[1:20:10] really that that I could relate to.
[1:20:12] That's all right. Just keep looking cuz
[1:20:14] you're going to find something.
[1:20:15] Hallelujah. It's going to hit.
[1:20:19] But Ruth or Naomi, excuse me, Naomi
[1:20:22] could not stay in the land of Moab
[1:20:26] anymore. She could not stay there. She
[1:20:29] had to return. And the reason why she
[1:20:32] had to return because there was a
[1:20:34] spiritual call. There was a voice, "Come
[1:20:38] back.
[1:20:40] Come back." And she heard that call.
[1:20:45] And she left the land of Mo.
[1:20:49] friend, that's why many of us are here
[1:20:51] today. But if you yourself, others that
[1:20:54] are sitting here today, if you don't
[1:20:55] know what's going on in your life, let
[1:20:57] me tell you, your purpose is that God
[1:21:00] has called you from the world. He's
[1:21:02] called you from the churches out there.
[1:21:04] He's called you into a land, a land of
[1:21:08] promise, a a a land full of promise.
[1:21:13] Amen.
[1:21:15] That is for you, friend.
[1:21:18] Amen. God has so anointed you. Amen.
[1:21:24] Open your eyes.
[1:21:29] One of the saddest cases is Judas. He
[1:21:32] walks up to Jesus, kisses him on the
[1:21:34] cheek. He is that close to him and turns
[1:21:38] around and walks away from him.
[1:21:41] people that come so close to Christ and
[1:21:45] don't even know that he's here.
[1:21:50] He's right here in the building right
[1:21:52] now.
[1:21:53] It has nothing to do with me. Do you
[1:21:55] know where he will be at? He'll be where
[1:21:57] his word is at. Amen. If I have spoken
[1:22:00] the word today, it brings the presence
[1:22:03] of God.
[1:22:07] Do you believe he's here? Amen.
[1:22:10] really believe that
[1:22:12] the king of glory,
[1:22:14] almighty God, believe he's here right
[1:22:17] now.
[1:22:19] Then you should stand your feet right
[1:22:20] now. Stand your feet right now and bow
[1:22:23] your heads to the Lord Jesus.
[1:22:27] Amen.
[1:22:29] He is here right now.
[1:22:32] And as you are praying,
[1:22:35] I want you to take a good look at your
[1:22:37] life. Lord, I do not I do not want to
[1:22:43] stay in the land of Moab.
[1:22:46] I don't want to stay in the Lord. Am I
[1:22:48] in the land of Moab? Have I been there
[1:22:51] in the land of Moab? Lord, I'm sorry.
[1:22:53] I've looked at my life. I'm a pastor.
[1:22:56] I've looked at my life and when the Lord
[1:22:58] be to put this message upon my heart, I
[1:23:00] fell on my knees and I said, "Lord, I'm
[1:23:02] sorry. I don't want to be in the land of
[1:23:04] Moab.
[1:23:06] I don't want to stay here, Lord. I want
[1:23:09] to go back to where I was at at one
[1:23:11] time. Lord, I know that there's more for
[1:23:15] me than what I've got right now. There's
[1:23:17] more for me. There's more for you, my
[1:23:18] friend, than what you got right now. God
[1:23:21] can give you more. But the question is,
[1:23:23] do you want more for your life? Lord, I
[1:23:27] cannot give it to you, Jehovah God. You
[1:23:31] admitted, you testified that Jehovah God
[1:23:33] is here right now. And therefore, he is
[1:23:36] willing to pour out his spirit. He's
[1:23:38] willing to fill your heart and to give
[1:23:40] you more than what you got.
[1:23:43] But you have to want to go back.
[1:23:47] Hallelujah. You have to want that in
[1:23:49] Christ Jesus. Amen. Naomi made that
[1:23:52] decision. She said, "No more. I don't
[1:23:55] want Moab. I don't want this life of
[1:23:57] Moab. I want the life of the land of
[1:24:00] Israel. I want Jesus Christ."
[1:24:03] Hallelujah. We're going to pray right
[1:24:06] now. We're going to pray right now, my
[1:24:08] friend. Hallelujah. Almighty God is here
[1:24:11] walking through the building, my friend.
[1:24:13] Hallelujah. He's willing. He's able to
[1:24:16] pour out his spirit. He's willing to
[1:24:17] fill you with the Holy Ghost. He's
[1:24:19] willing to change your life.
[1:24:22] Hallelujah.

[1:24:37] change. I want a change in my life. And
[1:24:39] she pushed through the crowd to touch
[1:24:41] the hymn of his garment. Barnameus said,
[1:24:44] "Thou son of David, have mercy upon me.
[1:24:47] I want a change in my life." Hallelujah.
[1:24:51] God can change it today. Hallelujah. as

[1:46:48] Now, right where you're at, I'm going to
[1:46:50] ask you first. I'll ask brother uh
[1:46:54] brother if you will come to the
[1:46:56] I'm drawing a blank. Brother, if you
[1:46:58] come to Brother Brooks, you just come to
[1:47:01] the platform. But right where you're at,
[1:47:02] brother and sister, you close your eyes
[1:47:04] for a moment. Just want as your eyes are
[1:47:07] closed,
[1:47:09] your soul here, we're going to have a
[1:47:11] word of prayer. And is there a soul
[1:47:13] here, we just like to say before I turn
[1:47:15] it over to the pastor and say, "Lord
[1:47:18] God, I truly
[1:47:21] I don't want to live in the land of
[1:47:23] Moab,
[1:47:24] but I want to be in that place where you
[1:47:27] want me to be. I want to be in that
[1:47:30] place where God, you can just fill me
[1:47:32] with your righteousness and do to my
[1:47:35] life whatever you would want me to do.
[1:47:38] You like to just lift your hand to God.
[1:47:41] Let us pray. Dear gracious heavenly
[1:47:43] father, I just feel the pull to do this
[1:47:46] right at this moment because Lord, our
[1:47:49] attitude makes a difference. And right
[1:47:52] now, Lord God,
[1:47:55] right now you see our hand, you see our
[1:47:57] heart. And God, we don't want to stay in
[1:47:59] this place.
[1:48:02] Lord, I know that journey took a little
[1:48:04] time to go from Moab to Israel. It might
[1:48:07] take us a little time, but God, we're
[1:48:09] not going to we're not going to
[1:48:10] entertain the thought that we're not
[1:48:12] going to arrive. Lord, we're on the
[1:48:13] journey. We're going back. Lord, I'm not
[1:48:15] staying here no more, Lord. I want to go
[1:48:18] back. I want to be back in that land,
[1:48:20] Lord.
[1:48:22] God, look upon that heart now, Lord
[1:48:24] Jesus, and may your will be done in
[1:48:26] their life. As their hands are lifted,
[1:48:28] Lord, as a testimony of their heart to
[1:48:31] you, Lord Jesus, may you look upon them
[1:48:34] now in Jesus name we pray.
[1:48:38] Amen. Brother Brooks, you glory to God.
[1:48:41] Glory, glory, glory to God.
[1:48:50] Glory to God. Glory to God.
