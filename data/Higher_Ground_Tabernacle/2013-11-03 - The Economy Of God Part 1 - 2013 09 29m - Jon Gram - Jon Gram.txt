TRANSCRIPT
========================================
who's the one who takes care of you that's what I'm thinking about right now amen amen you know there's times you have things in your life you have to do and you're nervous about it you have negative feelings and thoughts but if God's called you amen who can stop you amen you certainly can't stop yourself amen let's let's hold on to that this morning as we turn our turn our Bibles to Psalms 127 just couldn't quite get away from this thought here as I studied and prepared so I trust to be a blessing amen Psalms 1271 accept the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it accept the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain let's bow our heads here together as we pray I ask everyone to be sincere here with me yes let's just bow our heads together and unite our faith here Lord Jesus how we need you father to build this house Lord father this great economy Lord that we're in Lord God we need you to build it father we need you father to come this morning Lord as we are feeling in ourselves inadequate Lord father you're certainly more than able to breach that Gap Lord father that Gap that exists between where we are now and where we need to be Lord so Lord Jesus I pray you'd help each and every one of us to get out of your way Lord father for you are the Builder Lord God you are the one that comes Lord Jesus and you lay that brick you lay that mortar all we have to do there is help you and assist you Lord God stand there and hand you father tools that you need father to work on our lives Lord hand things over to you not hold things back but give it all to you Lord help us Lord we pray we need you father help me to get out of the way Lord help us all father come Lord Jesus we pray just now we need you Lord Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated there amen amen I'd like to speak this morning on the economy of God amen think about how that scripture we first read in Psalms 127 there think about that as we go through these things Hallelujah the second kind of definition is careful management of available resources am amen amen so basically you know kind of to sum it up that I just kind of put it like this the wealth and resources of a nation and that's a the definition is the wealth and resources of a nation and all the means by which which it is created maintained and improved so think about that it's important I want to stress this here I take a little bit of time to stress this it's important that we apply and and bring everything back to this definition as we go down through all these scriptures and all these thoughts amen because that's how I had to do it to make it perfectly it was perfectly clear when I did that amen an economy consists of an economic system and look at this with spiritual eyes yes sir comprising the production distribution or trade and consumption of limited goods and services between two agents the agents can be individuals businesses organizations or governments transactions occur when both parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good commonly expressed in the currency amen think about this the currency we're going to get into and the economy of God is Faith amen amen amen I'm getting ahead of myself but that truly is the currency that you use to buy and get what you need amen amen think about it without faith no man can please God right no transactions without faith Amen Brother Richard if you don't have money right now can you buy anything in this economy in this worldly economy you go to the store and you say I want this that the other and they ask you for money and you say I don't have it and they say I'm sorry you ain't getting it amen amen that's right yeah that's right a given economy is a result of a set of processes that involves its culture values educ ation technological Evolution history social organization and so forth amen these factors give it context content and set the conditions and parameters which the economy functions yes right amen amen praise the Lord let's go back to the beginning here shall we amen I like when the Pharisees came to Jesus and they were talking about a hard hard question you know they come to him and tried to trick him up right and they tried to say you know what about this marriage and divorce thing you know and that was a hard thing to deal with right but they come to him and and I like Jesus basically just said go back to the beginning you know it's all mixed up right now all these variables have entered in through the course of time to create all these complex issues and situations it's so hard to understand go back to the beginning where it was simple am God laid it all out in the beginning so that's what we ought to do right now right we can surely see this economy right there in the beginning the economy of God amen amen so let's go back there in Genesis we're going to kind of Jump Around in Genesis a little bit if you want to jump with me amen Genesis 2 there 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and keep it and can you imagine this God put the man in the climax of his creation on the seven all these things were all done then the climax of God's creation come and he creates man and puts him there right and he says this is this is for you to keep this is my great the the wealth I mean can you imagine just go down through Genesis and see all the rivers and the waters and all the vegetation all the rich Lush everything that was there was for them right this was God's place this his economy they put him in amen amen and he was in control of everything wasn't he sir if he didn't like the weather he would just speak and it would change amen right if he didn't like where this mountain was or this tree was he would just speak and it would move right so he had complete control I believe that's God's desire for us isn't it we're supposed to have complete control of this economy amen that we are in amen that's right amen yes sir he named all the animals even so he was a master scientist knew all the names right amen then what happened was in Genesis 2 let's continue reading there in 16 and the Lord commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou May freely eat but the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day thou shal eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so we see two economies here start to to come out in front take root here take picture God always has freeor agency and we got to remember that in this economy amen amen God has always allowed free agency to be there in his spiritual economy so you can choose what you want you can choose God his economy or you can choose Satan in his economy right you can same thing in the beginning praise the Lord amen excuse me here so we definitely see this in the beginning and I want to move past this a little bit here I don't know why but I need to move on Amen you know the importance of this economy is is just I can't overstress it because this is a little thing I found in a commentary that it says that Jesus talked much about money 16 of the 38 Parables were concerned with how to handle money and possessions in the gospel an amazing one out of 10 verses deal directly with the subject of money the Bible offers 500 verses on prayer less than 500 verses on faith but more than 2,000 verses on money and possessions can you imagine that I mean this was stressed amen this was this was something we're to pay attention to amen turn to John 3 with me if we would please thank you John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so this economy is something that we have to understand we have to be born again into it right it's like this if you don't if you're not born into this economy there's no way you can understand it there's no way you can participate in it that's right Amen in this worldly economy that involves our uh money of currency that we buy and things for exchange if you don't understand how that works how are you going to participate in it how are you going to effectively participate in it so Jesus stresses here you must be born again or you cannot even see this Kingdom this economy of God right amen that's why it ought to be our goal everyone in here young people included it ought to be your goal to receive that Holy Ghost that ought to be your whole life's goal amen and then when you receive the Holy Spirit now you're entered into the spiritual economy now you can participate people think that's an end but it's not an end it's just the beginning amen oh my that is such a fallacy it is not the end the holy spirit is not the end right when you get that Holy Spirit the battle start right there because you are now entering into that economy that's been waiting for you before the foundations of the world Amen you was in God's mind before the foundation of the world right you were always there amen he always wanted you there you're just now realizing it right now amen we come to this economy this spiritual economy is so rich God has prepared for us there are so many promises for you that you need to buy with your faith amen so let's quit complaining and murmuring and thinking we can't do it because you can't God through you can amen that's why the Bible says take his faith amen it's God's faith that you buy he gives that to you but you must ask seek and knock amen you must desire it and that's what we're getting into with this spiritual economy that's why the Bible I'm getting ahead of myself again but the treasures of this world that's the issue with it it's not about having money in this world that's not necessarily the problem it's when that's what you desire that's the problem so desire that Faith amen amen because wherever your heart is that's where your treasure will be amen amen praise the Lord help us Lord we need God's help don't we amen break this yoke Lord amen the devil tries to stop you with so many things and purposes in your life he doesn't want you to understand this economy right Satan knows that if you understand this economy you can amass riches Beyond Your Wildest imaginations my father is Rich will get to that he's Rich he has all things amen can you imagine a man that has infinite amount of of riches we cannot even imagine that it's uncomprehended but that's okay you don't have to understand it just believe it amen it's for you amen Satan doesn't want that he's trying to hinder us right now I feel it I don't know there's something that's that's striking at me before I came out there I don't know I just kind of something was really a spiritual battle I don't know what's going on if it's just me or if there's something else going on here but Satan is trying to hinder this right now he is he tried to stumble me up at the beginning I don't know what's going on Amen so we'll just blast him on out of here amen so raise your faith and pull amen praise the Lord amen I want to be I want to see all you to be spiritual millionaires when we leave this room amen you got needs you pull on it here this morning amen God has all the faith you can ever need yes sir don't worry he ain't going to run out amen it's like that example of the ocean you know there ain't you your little fishy swimming around there he ain't going to drink too much water he ain't going to make that ocean go dry you're not going to make that ocean go dry Keith take everything you need amen hallelujah praise the Lorden yes sir Satan's not going to have his way this morning amen yes he's not God have his way amen praise the Lord Romans 1120 if you would please for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse so we see there's parallels here we see God in the creation right we see the spiritual through the natural right so that's why I'm getting at here there are so many things that we can look at our natural economy and we can look at and compare and see and understand the spiritual economy types and shadows God's law he he set all these things up like that so we can understand our finite Minds can understand by looking because look we're human beings we've got to have tangible things that we can see right that's how we're made it's hard for that's why it's so hard many times for us to enter the spiritual realm I'm talking about myself here because we can't see it Paul said the things that are unseen are Eternal and the things that are seen will perish amen so we can use these things that we can see as an example to help us you know in our our feeble finite mind it's okay we can do that and God said so right here because he's through all the creation the things that we can see the resurrection look at the flowers and all the things how they come up and then they have life and they wilter and get old and die and they come right back up the next season right so God has set these things he has Mercy on us he knows our infallibility he knows our incapabilities right he does Amen so he has mercy so I'm glad that God has set these things up here so that we can see this spiritual economy through the natural economy amen amen amen praise the Lord 1 Corinthians 2:10 but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay yay the Deep things of God verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God Amen you want to have eyes to see this spiritual economy God will show it to you amen that's why God works in you through you to show you this economy Ephesians 1:17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in him in the knowledge of him rather the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling amen and the riches of the glory of this inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe amen according to the working of his mighty power you see that amen he this is this is something amen yes sir let's go to Saul in company and let's look at them for a minute let's let's see for a minute how that Saul he had some trouble seeing he did he did am he didn't quite have the spiritual eyes that David had amen and I know that God and believe that God put these two characters together Amen to show this to illustrate this point because this is exactly what we need for this spiritual economy we don't want to be Sauls do we no sir we don't want to be like that amen let's read that here in 2 Samuel 26 we have David and I'll just kind of paraphrase for the sake of time here but it's 1st Samuel 268 12 is where we're kind of at so we have Saul pursuing after David for no reason because of his own jealousy and uh you know maybe his anger maybe his uh lust for power and popularity because he saw that uh they ascribed to David's 10 thousands and me only thousands you know type of thing you know how he had that working on its heart right so there was things going on in the economy of Satan that was that Saul was heavily intertwined with that he could not get away from because he couldn't see but we have David kind of running from him at times kind of trying to stay away from him and we have them come in this situation here to a cave right I believe it was a cave and Saul it says in here that the Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon Saul and his people and therefore David saw this and his men saw this and said go in there and kill them there look the Lord's delivered him under into your hands and David said I will not do this I will not do this at all I will not touch the Lord's anointed so you see even even God brings this out in this in the natural with this deep sleep that he could not know he had no idea what was going on around him his life was in danger in perils he could have been killed right in this economy that he's in and all these remember now this this spiritual economy of Satan now there's many ways to look at it Satan has rule over the natural economy in many ways and God's involved in the natural economy in many ways too and Satan is involved in the spiritual economy and so is God they you know Satan loves to follow God he loves to to take what God has done and pervert it he loves to be a follower he's not a leader he's not God is a leader God is a supreme leader Satan always follows that up so that's where Satan's always trailing behind trying to copy right he's trying to pervert everything so so that's why there's there's there's there's parallels here the spiritual economies the natural economies so Saul was caught up in this in the natural economy No Doubt right in the spiritual economy as well showing that in this illustration he was blind he couldn't even see what was going on around him we don't want to be like that amen amen God's economy brings life amen praise the Lord how about Nicodemus in John 3 how he comes to to God he comes to Jesus there and he says in verse four Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born again when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb amen so Jesus starts talking to uh Nicodemus here about the economy he does Amen you must be born again amen amen yes sir you that's the door of the spiritual economy how can these things be he you know he talks about all these things Jesus brings out and starts to try to teach him the basics of the economy the door the entering in of the door of this spiritual this great vast spiritual economy and Nicodemus is like wow how can these things be right because you know Nicodemus was caught up in Satan's economy it was blinding his eyes he couldn't hardly believe this this this thing that Jesus was telling him my Deuteronomy 15 I like to use a lot of scripture so I hope that's okay I mean I just just want to that's what I fall back on the scriptures you know I know they're infallible I know that there's no way that they can be they can't fall or fail or you know and if I if I think there's an there it's just my own lack of understanding amen amen so we can trust the word of God Amen all right Deuteronomy 15 5 through6 is where we're at looking at this how that the economy of the United States was built upon a great economy of God it was it was built upon the economy of God in the beginning now that's why we that's why the United States has the great has had uh we we're definitely falling but has had the greatest economy the world has ever seen nothing has ever come close to this and we take it for granted because we've lived in it we've grown up in it a lot of us you know uh no doubt for a couple hundred years now it's been a great economy and we just it's so common to us but if we could only step outside and really look back in you would wow this is something I mean this this just breaks the all records of History so Deuteronomy 15 5-6 only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to observe and to do all these Commandments which I command you this day now look he set the condition this is what made the the the economy of the United States so great because we did verse five in the beginning we did verse five verse six for the Lord thy God blessed thee as he promised and thou shalt lend unto many nations but Thou shalt not borrow and thou shalt Reign Over many nations but they shall not re over thee amen does everyone realize that the United States has had the what do they call it the the currency of the world the uh what's it called brother Keith sorry I forget it's it's a reserve the reserve currency of the world everyone buys and brings our buys our currency so they can have that as their Reserve right it's like an investment like the Chinese they own a third of our United States I believe something like that a large portion amen because they have a lot of our money right so look at that can you see that there the scripture says right there if you listen and hearken unto the Commandments of the Lord then you'll lend to many nations right they'll use your money amen you won't be borrowing from anybody you won't need to because you'll be so rich right your economy will be so great and you'll Reign Over many nations but they shall not Reign Over You I thought that was a powerful scripture that really Illustrated this this economy the natural economy and the spiritual economy as we'll get into the spiritual economy was first that's why the natural economy could be so righteous and great but we're falling away from that Saints Psalms 112 1-3 praise ye the Lord blessed is the man that fearth the Lord that delighteth greatly in his Commandments his seed shall be Mighty on the earth the generations of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and the righteous shall endure forever amen oh my Hallelujah I hope is everyone seeing this connection that we're talking about here my praise the Lord so we definitely see a correlation here a correlation is a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things that word connection is a relationship in which a person thing or idea is linked or associated with something else you see that St John 14 if you would turn there so these economies I mean the and that's what you know Satan takes advantage of that he takes advantage of the fact that these all these things can be so mixed because as we said when the Pharisees come to Jesus and they said they have this great question about putting away your wife and this marriage and divorce thing right and it was and isn't that so complicated today I mean all the variables that have happened with the marriage and divorce all the other things all the circumstances and just poor people putting conditions and things that happen this is such a complicated thing but that's what Satan wants see he wants things to be so complicated so it's so hard to understand what's what's right and wrong black is black and white is white still amen no matter how much time goes by no matter what Satan does or doesn't do no matter how complicated things get black is black and white is white we've got to get back to the black and the white amen we do yes this philosophy in this day and age how people say that there's some you know there's so much intermingling there so much gray area going on there is nobody wants black white anymore and that's what Satan wants us to desire oh it's okay we can all blend together you know let's let's mix and match and you know just drop your beliefs and come to you know whatever the economical movement's doing and you know your workplace and all we're trying to just diversify and and tolerate everything I I agree with diversity and tolerance I do but not the way Satan's trying to apply it he's trying to take your values away he's trying to take the principles you hold true way he's trying to make black and white gray yeah that's right yes everywhere amen but but there is a correlation here there there truly is between these all these economies St John 14:1 15-21 is where we're going here if you love me keep my Commandments black and white amen if you love me I mean that's pretty simple isn't it Jesus says if you love me keep my word amen amen read the black and white keep that black and white amen that's what last time I checked there's some red letters in there too but there's a lot of black and white right amen yes sir the red letters are just stressing they're just saying these are really really important you know look at this amen so if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give another comforter that you may abide with you forever prise the Lord even the spirit of Truth there it is the spirit of truth will come to you amen whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him amen but ye know him for he dwelleth in you and shall be in you yes sir I will not leave you comfortless I will come unto you yet look at this this is what I'm talking about as we go on here this is a correlation this is the definition is correlation Let me refresh it a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things that's what we're talking about see this connection that Jesus is talking about amen a relationship in which person's things or ideas is linked look at this in verse 18 and I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more because ye see me because I live yet ye shall live also amen see the corations we're talking about here the spiritual economy you will live and we'll get into this Satan's economy is death he tries to disguise himself as light as Life we'll get to that Lord willing verse 20 this is it right this is one of the main highlights of this this portion at that day you shall know I am in the father ye in me and I in you thank you Lord can't get no more interconnected than that we can't even understand that all the wayu my that's right we receive it brother amen verse 21 he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he is is he that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself unto him yes sir amen thank you Lord 1 Corinthians 4:8 now you are full now you are rich you have reigned as kings without us and I would to God you did Reign so this is a rich economy what do we really have here is the question what do we really have because that's a lot of the problem we don't fully always realize what we really have in this spiritual economy because so many times we go running after this natural economy amen block out your time one time just once take a take a week or whatever and block out your time and see where you put all your time at C make two c categories the the natural economy and the spiritual economy do that one time and see what all where where all your time falls right I I just you know as a friendly challenge do that just maybe if you haven't already it might open your eyes now I'm not trying to be legalistic here but what I'm trying to say is let's put this in perspective am amen if you truly know and believe what we have then you'll pay more attention to that amen concept that I just said you'll watch where your time goes amen amen there's a direct correlation between that amen amen praise the Lord balam was a good example he didn't fully understand what he had right there because there's many of us that'll never interact with God like he did but he threw it all away because he was more interested in this natural economy amen he he did amen so whatever you put first that shows which one you believe in more right amen all right as I said in the beginning Revelation 2212 you can you know through 14 if you want to turn there I am the Alpha and the Omega verse 13 the beginning and the end the first and the last as I said in the beginning this is true my father is Rich amen he's the richest man there's ever been amen can you imagine a man so rich that he can continually give to his children down through the thousands and thousands of years and not even put a dent in his bank account that's something a't it he just he's Rich he's just so rich I we can't even my amen Romans 11:33 oh the depth and Riches of both the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways are PF finding out right Psalms 104:24 oh Lord how manif are thy Works in wisdom thou Hast made them all the Earth is full of thy riches amen so the Earth is full of his riches that would mean that heaven is so over full with his riches that it spills over into Earth right because Earth is the foot stol right yeah so so it overflows right in there and it's it just aren't you glad aren't you happy that that we can cry out to God and he can overflow us with his riches amen it it's not all kept up there in reserve and we and we only get to see it when we go to heaven you know we up there and now we can finally wow see the riches of God no it's not that way his spiritual economy is right now on this Earth as much as Satan tries to Blind your eyes from that it's true you know Satan tries to make you look at this natural economy and it's so real like we said we're beings that we we have these five natural senses you know and and whatever comes these five natural senses many times we battle with and making that our absolute like oh I see it so you know it has to be true right no no that's true no no that's not it those all those senses are are secondary to your to your faith amen your spiritual sense amen praise the Lord than you Lord yes sir amen praise the Lord so let's look a little bit more about what this economy is this economy of God is this all right here amen amen all right okay Ephesians 3 we'll go to Ephesians 3:7 as your Turner let me read you a quote here and hear ye him 1958 the wheels of God's power and kingdoms can't turn because we got old sluggy dirty axle grease that don't belong there hallu anybody ever feel that wayall get get some things maybe in your joints you know you can't move as well right some old old dirt and sludge it shouldn't be there the byproduct of Satan's economy that's right yeah feel sluggish amen what we need tonight is the washing by the water through the word amen amen the holy ghost power to come back into the church and start the wheels of God's economy turning amen amen that's what we need a little washing by the water of the word amen so remember that because Satan's trying to keep you away from that he doesn't want you to be washed by by the water of the word he doesn't want you to put much time into that he doesn't want you to have uh time allocated to the spiritual economy of God he doesn't and he'll fight you tooth and nail he'll fight you every bit everything that he's got he'll fight you oh I got to do this and I got to do that and I got to make a living for the family you got to do those things yes but they should not be a priority they should not be your number one they should not it shouldn't be like this I'm going to go do this in the in the world and that I got to do my job and I got to you know spend time here and do this that and the other and go buy this go this this and then at the end of the day I finally if I have some time I'll pray that's not how it should be sir no no sir so Ephesians 3:7 we'll turn there wherefore I was made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power in this economy we'll see a lot about the working of God's power yes amen amen yes sir unto me Who Am less than the least of all the saints is the grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ amen and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which was from the beginning of the world hath been hid who ha created All Things by Jesus Christ amen so Paul was to make these unsearchable riches known to everyone right amen Colossians 1:26 through 28 says even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to the Saints Amen in this hour this is what this Revelation is is coming forth the the you know the the word was open to us right the seals were broken open so now we have this unveiling this Revelation this this this manifestation to the Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory am amen this economy of God is Christ in you the hope of glory amen amen that's right it's very simple amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord you know I think many times we get so complicated on things we try to make things what they're not and that's basically all it is receive the holy spirit amen amen then God will do the rest amen you just got to get to that Holy Ghost so many times we you know and even when we get it then that's when the battle comes and Satan tries to make you think that you got to do it more you got to keep going on you got to do the work you as we said in the beginning you got to bridge the gap right that's what Satan wants you to think yeah you are an instrument you just yield you're a vessel amen God does the work he builds the economy amen thank you and it's so many times the reason why he's not building we think oh God why are you not building why is this not happening why is this not progressing what's going on here it's because you're in the way do you think that he think about this for a minute what what if you were at a construction site and you were up up there up on the wall right there in there were building this wall and you're right up on there on it are they going to keep building with you right there standing in the way because they'll hurt you amen they'll damage you they you'll be killed I mean whatever more I mean imagine this V Mass construction site that's going on there ain't no construction site any bigger than what God's doing in your life there ain't no there's not one bigger than that right so therefore get out of the way yes sir let the master builder do what he's supposed to do let him do his job all you got to do is assist him or do whatever he ask you to do right am you just stand by and wait for him to give you instructions wait for him to ask you for something whatever he needs yield yourself amen that's right he'll ask whatever he needs just that's the position we got to take Lord whatever you need I'll do whatever you want Hallelujah if he asks you to do something that you think you don't know how to do he'll train you yes sir amen right he'll put that in you he'll put that knowledge and skill in you what did he do when they were building the Tabernacle all these workers came forth who it said that God put wisdom and skill into these men to build this Tabernacle to Fashion all these things what if these men would have said hey I don't know how to do that I you know I I can't I've never done that before or I'm just an amateur I can't build this Tabernacle for God right God used these men it wasn't the ability of these men was it it was [Applause] that's right whatever part you don't understand uh you know I I see this that and the other but I don't quite see how these two go together he'll come over and explain it to you right just ask him amen just get on your knees and ask him Lord so many times we get so discouraged and we think that we got to understand everything and we think that we got to know exactly what this blueprint says we do but he'll reveal it to you not in your own power right lean not to your own understanding right amen sometimes we think we understand understand it we get ahead of ourselves and we get a little ahead of him too right we start building and we get in the way and then he's like oh you know then he has to stop construction because he has to stop construction hold everybody up on the site blow the big siren stop we got somebody in the way yeah amen help us Lord can can anyone relate to this yes sir am I the only one no God help us to get out of the way out of our own thinking out of our own minds we want the mind of Christ that's right we do amen amen that is how you get it that's how you increase the riches in this great economy of God you can't do it yourself you're a you're kind a natural being right now right natural things we can do many natural things but let him do the spiritual things amen oh my Satan tries to trip us up in this he truly has a false economy Satan does if you want to turn to Second Corinthians we'll show this here 2 Corinthians 11 let me let me read this to you as you turn in 2 Corinthians 1113 is where we're going to go uh it says here in in uh mark of the beast all right and I saw a woman sitting Upon A Scarlet colored Beast rich full of names of blasphemy false baptism false economy Leading the People blindly telling them they can just come to church make the confession and so forth and do a Hail Mary do repentance ignorance nonsense yes sir so Satan wants you know he he's truly got a false economy it's it's real it's tangible we can we can operate in it we can you know we can be led by it we can we can it can seem so great to us but it's false that's right just as brother Brandon was saying here that's what this that's what the the you know the organization the organizational Church does they're leading all these people to a false hope a false light they genuinely a lot of them probably think they're going the right way they're in the right economy they're you know they're taking the right steps they're building the right way they're they're all there building you know look at that and in the world there and the denominations as organization it's all about what you can do it's your works right it's it's about you know you doing this and doing that look at how there are some of those churches that have more of a Ministry active Ministry than we ever do they're out here in the world doing this that and the other and and feeding the poor and doing all these things you know the ministry of sports and you know I see Sports Ministries and all you know think about these things things they're doing so much they're they're trying to build the wall themselves the problem is they're not letting Christ do it amen they're not letting the foreman do it they're trying to they're trying to be the foreman they're trying to say they know how to do it they're trying to interpret the drawing the BL blueprints right that's what Satan wants that's what Satan's trying to lead you to do he's just as religious as he's more religious than everybody else right he comes right in there he wants you to follow this religious path he'll just he'll just skew it quite a bit if a flight leaves from Los Angeles a plane leaves from Los Angeles and goes to New York let me just throw some figures out if that plane skews and forgive me these may not be exact but if that plane skews one degree from Los Angeles to New York it's going to be off hundreds and hundreds of miles hundreds of what A Thousand Miles Whatever by one degree follow the straight narrow way stay on that path that middle Road amen 2 Corinthians 11:13 for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light wow amen that that Greek word there is light fire light and fire that's what that word kind of translates too so light we know is is a very abundant natural resource right very abundant but the thing about light that we take for granted it says here in the definition light is a natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things visible so Satan you see what he's doing here he's transforming himself into an angel of Light false light false economy right he's and in this definition look at this the natural agent that stimulates sight so he's trying to be this false stimulation of sight and making things visible but the things he's making visible is false amen amen amen think about light let's go back to this example light is so common right we are so used to the sunlight being here we are we're so used to lights we're so used to them we take them for granted but think about how valuable light is think about this no light on the Earth Earth Gone you'd wish you had it you you couldn't do nothing else that'd be it right so it's so valuable it's one of the most valuable things we have we take it for granted it's because it's such an abundance so don't take this economy of God for granted amen amen because it is so abundant because it is so vast don't let it become common amen amen 1957 life is the title here and I read an article in the magazine one time that I was on when I was on an airplane and it was about Hollywood and it said Life begins after midnight see that lie of the devil talking about Hollywood and they're trying to portray these you know big flashing life really begins after midnight right that's what he's saying here you should come down on certain streets and things and they had a picture uh of burkel's que and I'm not sure what that word means and it said like this how perverted that is so he's looking at the lights and the and the Billboards and the pictures right this Magazine's trying to portray and and and show that life really begins after midnight look at all these lights look at all this activity look at all these sinful things going on all the pleasures of the world right you see if Satan has a kingdom he's got to have a false economy he's got to have something that he can present to them to make them think they're living but it's absolutely on the vice versa side it's death in the form of life amen see that amen yeah it's true 2 Corinthians 4 in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them my that's his purpose with this false economy he's trying to Blind your eyes amen now think about Satan's natural economy his spiritual economy think about it how you get how we can get so caught up in these things and think about what it does it blinds you to what you really need to do it blinds you to your place in this economy of God it blinds you to what really matters in life right amen think about what Satan's doing this movement and it's Universal again let's look at the let's look at the uh the natural movement this this and there's good and bad in here remember we're talking about the knowledge of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's what we were talking about in the beginning you had these two economies the the Tree of Life the economy of life and you had the economy of Good and Evil right those two trees in the garden right there from the beginning they were God allowed it for free moral agency if there was only the tree of life or the economy of God that was it period there'd be no free moral AG nothing to choose from you have one choice but God as we'll see had to express his attributes in his great economy to make free moral agency to do that right no fre moral agency God's attributes could not be expressed there' be no need for them amen there'd be no need for a Healer there' be no need for a savior there'd be no need for this kind of things right so Satan's taken this economy this this remember now it started out when we had all these little economies all over the world and now it's starting to be all integrated into one the whole world is becoming one big great economy they're pressing for World Banks and World currencies and all kinds of world standards and the UN making up all kinds of standards to regulate the money and a business and all kinds of things right Satan is wanting that and pressing for it because he wants it all to be one right he wants to have control over it all he wants to have massive control so the same is happening spiritually what is happening with the churches of today that's right just forget about that little Doctrine or this there or that black and white and just all come together let's all be one right that's what's happening today he's trying to unite and merge the economies it's what Satan wants night for a common purpose is what combin means so let me ask you something here how can two walk together except they be agreed right right how can they do that if if in order to AG to agree you have to take out uh let me read this here they have to take out everything that they may disagree on that's how you walk together with somebody with agree with them because you got to take all this either either you step aside and you say this is wrong this is right and you can't agree then you just kind of set part your ways right because you can't have fellowship with Darkness light can't have fellowship with Darkness so in order to walk together with two and they disagree you have to put aside all the all the things you disagree on if you do that it creates a characterless principlist valueless belief worthless relationship think about that it's true amen second Timothy 3 says here in verse one this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-m minded you seen all this lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away amen it says in the last days so this is the culmination of Satan's Purpose with the economies that he's working with here that's right amen we're working closer and closer to this every day every day amen but we have to come against it that's right in the name of the Lord just as David came out against uh Goliath in the name of the Lord right we must do the same to Satan's huge spiritual and natural economy amen how do you think David felt when he came out to a Goliath and all these thousands of men were cowering I mean there had have been some mind battles there yeah I mean his natural senses were picking up this situation right and no doubt in the spiritual realm fear was coming fear and these things were coming and and it just kind of you know it was really fighting this battle here right but he came against him in the name of the Lord so no matter what's in front of you this this this economy that Satan has that's right no matter what's in front of you you've got to come to it and in the name of the Lord by faith amen right because David by faith and he even took past experiences look the Lord was with me when I slew that lion right the Lord was with me when I slew that bear I knew it wasn't me it was him amen because I got out of the way and I let him build I know he's the Builder of this economy right he did that work right there with that lion right it wasn't me amen amen so he even came with some experience and he allowed that to build his faith amen hey whatever it takes to build your faith Let It Be build amen and then can come to this great economy this thing that Satan has in front of us this Giant Goliath and you can come to it in the name of the Lord and slay it cut its head off amen amen praise the Lord sometimes you know we Face Temptations and things in this in this great economy that Satan has on this Earth and we just got to cut its head off that's right we just got to once and for all cut its head off amen amen kill it right there amen sometimes these things can be painful for us to sever from our lives but we've got to do it amen amen amen just think about that amen I like to call Satan's economy one thing I like to say is it's called the elosan economy amen lady oan economy that's truly the false economy because as we'll look in Revelations 3 that's where we're going to go if you want to turn there Revelations 3:14 this lady oan economy verse 15 3:15 Revelation 3:15 because excuse me verse 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot Satan's economy is trying to make you lukewarm Saints that's right amen he's trying to bring this lukewarm State upon us you know where it's not black and white anymore it's in the gray right I I did the best I could type of thing right that's what he wants you to do so then because Thou Art lukewarm in verse 16 neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayth I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not thou that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried and fire that they may be rich with white rainment and thou may be clothed that thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with th that thou mayest see amen amen so you see what's going on here these people are rich and increased with Goods the natural economy of Satan right the spiritual economy of Satan's working and they're blind it's producing vanity That's what Satan wants this this this economy this false economy in this definition here producing no results that's what vain means producing no results in other words it's useless yeah amen useless look at this having no meaning or likelihood or fulfillment how many people do you know and how much do we struggle with this where we don't even have any purpose in life we're just wandering aimlessly around feeling sorry for ourselves maybe or some kind of trial hurting us or putting us down and we don't really do a whole lot we don't really have an impact on uh the impact that we should on Satan's economy right we need to impact that thing and tear it down and we don't have that impact that God's calling us to have you know as bride members who's going to be called to a higher calling than you right when we see people that are not even bride and they're out here making a bigger dent in Satan's economy as far as a negative Dent hurting it that shouldn't be that should not be here we are you know toiling away in this natural economy just and i' I've been so guilty this so many times you just feel like oh I'm just barely getting by I'm trying to keep above water it shouldn't be that way amen if it's that way we got to check up something's wrong amen we're not here to just struggle and barely get by we're here to have the victory we're here to overcome amen we're here to be rich in this economy of God am amen not to produce no results and be useless and not to have no meaning or likelihood or fulfillment amen but that's what Satan's false economy produces so that might be something we can check up with right there if we feel this way like we're producing no results and useless and having no meaning no likelihood no you know nothing we returning value check up and see where you're spent putting your time in your resources in right what economy you're working in amen right check up amen praise the Lord you can always tell what economy you're in by what fruit you're bearing right amenallah yeah amen whatever you're producing in that economy you know your workers in this economy you're producing things you know you can look at your prodct and see what it is and you can tell which economy you're working in amen so that's a little test for us all right praise the Lord blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled right so the point we're talking about here is you've got to hunger and thirst for the right economy amen I'm not saying to totally detach yourself we live in this world we're of you know we're in this world we have to we have to we have to make a living we have to do things in this world right but it's what you thirst after because it's a rule in the Bible right whatever you sow that's what you'll reap right so whatever you're thirsting for that's what you're going to get amen so the whole point is you got to thirst and hunger for the right things here the right economy you got to thirst for amen Luke 153 he that ha he hath filled the Hungry with good things and the rich he has sent away empty oh my that's Luke 1 153 Luke 621 if you want to turn there kind of what I just said there blessed are ye that hunger now verse 21 for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for you shall laugh blessed are ye that when men hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast you out of your out uh cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake Rejoice ye in the and leap for Joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did your fathers unto the prophets woe unto them that are rich for ye have received your consolation woe unto you that are full for you shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets amen oh my so you see what's going on here it's where it's what you're Desiring if right now all you're Desiring is these is these pleasures and these Riches of the world then later you're going to be empty amen amen because now we're put on this Earth right now to build our character amen right now we're put here to build that house to build that economy right to Build That Wall yes sir this is the only opportunity you're going to get amen right now in your life right now take advantage of it amen amen make sure you hunger thirst for that righteousness praise the Lord you know riches we talk about money this economy and a lot of times our minds fixated on on physical money but riches are not only you know when the Bible goes through it here like we can turn to Proverbs 28:22 he that hasten to be rich hath an evil eye and consider not that poverty shall come upon him so a greedy man in other words in this other translation says a greedy man is in a hurry for wealth he doesn't know that poverty will come upon him right you know riches here all through these scriptures in the Bible there's so many scriptures on riches is not always you it's not always just talking about money what so what else do we hold as value because riches are something of high value do we hold anything in our lives in this economy that shouldn't be there that we reg we take in such high regard that keeps us from the economy of God in a certain way right I mean I don't you know you you can think about that am we all have those battles amen amen praise the Lord Matthew 6:24 just uh something to jot down no man can serve two masters for he'll hate the one or love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and money that's right that's what mam is money am think about you know the Disciples of Jesus Christ going back to that day and they all gather around him and he says you know I got to send you out into this wicked world to preach the gospel and I know that there are the economy of Satan is so vast and great and and and all these things are going on in this economy and it's going to come against you but Jesus in Matthew Mark rather Mark 68 says and he commanded them that they should take nothing for their Journey save a staff only no script no bread no money in their purse right so he basically sends them out what in their mind might look like sheep Among Wolves right sends them out but God knew what he was doing here because going out in this vast this they're going out to face Goliath right in this vast economy of Satan to preach the economy of God to tell people about these great riches that that people have lost and he told them not even take any money because in Luke 2235 if you want to turn there it says and he said unto them when I sent you without a purse and a script and shoes lacked you anything and they said nothing we didn't lack a thing amen we lacked all these material things and we didn't have any money but but you provided all of our needs so think about that that's one of the main things about these treasures and these riches it's so hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven because of all these things are a burden these natural riches and cares are such a burden there's so many temptations that come along with them and it's so difficult so God knew that he didn't want them to be HED from this purpose of preaching the the economy of God to all to all the all around them so he sent them out with nothing so they couldn't be hindered by anything a't that something amen so when God puts a task in front of you and you don't think you're in you you you don't think you're adequate enough you don't think you have what it takes you don't think that you you know you don't have the right tools or knowledge or whatever God will give that to you God's doing that for a reason so you'll trust him because right here you can hold many things up as valuable things to in your life as riches aside from money and he doesn't want that to hinder you so if you're battling with something maybe that's what's happening God's trying to strip that from you so you'll trust him amen praise the Lord his ways are above our ways that's right we we can't always understand it but we know his heart right we don't always understand his mind or his head but we know his heart amen praise the Lord his word speaks his heart to us amen praise the Lord hallu amen Solomon you know the story was great about Solomon I really enjoyed when he come and he was beginning in his kingdom there this great economy that God had established for him the greatest time they've seen you know Israel has seen and and Solomon God comes to Solomon says ask whatever you want and I'll give it right what do you want and you notice how that Solomon didn't ask for riches or wealth or fame or power things like that he asked for a gift of wisdom wisdom to know how to operate in this great economy that God has set up for him amen right didn't God set that up I mean Solomon didn't set that up did he no he didn't set that the great glorious state that Israel was in at that time all those natural riches and things and the spiritual riches were flowing abundantly right Solomon didn't set that up no man set that up it was God Amen so Solomon said he recognized this God what do I do now put yourself in Solomon's shoes this is for you to learn from Solomon God what said what can I do God what do I need yes that's what I need wisdom to run this great economy to work in this great economy for your people it was a gift amen right so let's ask the same things in this great economy of God that he set up for us and he will work marvelously look at look at all the things that happened in Solomon's life there was nothing nobody ever seen anything like it the Queen of Sheba came and said the half was not even told my I find that hard to believe do you know that when gossip travels and word you know and information travels it gets greater and greater as it goes so even what she heard was probably greater than what was originally being told and still it wasn't even the half of it amen right so imagine that I mean we it's just so unfathomable the riches and he was this was a type showing the economy that God wants to establish spiritually in your lives ask for the right thing so you can help god build that economy because Solomon didn't say hey give me riches and wealth and fame and power so that I can continue to build this Kingdom he said give me wisdom so that I can work with you God because you are the author of wisdom right amen yes so that was a wonderful story amen so we ought to follow that example if you want to turn with me to Jeremiah 9 please 23 as you turn keep this in mind he that serves God for money will serve the devil for better wages so if you're all about serving God for money the devil can pay you better physical money now right let's go to Joseph too just hold your place there in the scripture Joseph said Joseph of arthea came in Matthew 27 and he had a choice because we have a choice here that's what we're getting at we have a choice you got to choose between these economies and Joseph came and saw Jesus Christ carrying this cross this heavy burden right carrying this heavy burden and he had a choice do I help him or not do I work with him or not right so he had he had an economy to choose here because this man was rich the Bible says he had many riches and he knew that if he got in there with that with that uh how do I want to say in a respectful manner that Cast Away right this crazy man this lunatic isn't that who they thought Jesus was this radical lunatic this radical young man comes along and tries to tell me a ruler how to be spiritual tries to tell me about the word of God who is this man he he come from a carpenter look at his background he doesn't he has no money he has no status he has no power he has no education that man's a lunatic he's out of his mind so imagine what Joseph was battling here he knew in his heart that was right he knew that he needed to get there and help him carry that cross they compelled him but he still had to make the decision sir God's compelling you but you still got to make the decision amen you still got to free more agency right amen amen hallelujah there's people at work you know and I I have responsibility over people uh to do functions at work and and I know right now that I can't my my style is I don't want to force people I never want to force people I mean as an absolute Last Resort if I have to if somebody really won't comply you know and even at that there's disciplinary action other things you can do but the point is you lead by love you leadership means that people follow you because they want to right because they want to that's when you get your your heart the heart the heart will come you know I don't just want it like let's say in a workplace I don't just want people's hands I could force their hands you have to do that or or I'll fire you right I not only want their hands I want their mind their head I want their heart right because there's so much more to people than just their hands well God knows that that's why he giving you free more agency because he wants all of you if he forced you all he's all he's going to get is out of legalism your hands right do works right so Joseph had a decision here he come in knowing what was right knowing the persecution knowing the ridicule knowing this great economy of Satan that was there and even the natural economy he was rich the Bible said he chose to carry that cross he chose it amen I think it was Joseph right I have the I I have the wrong scripture here but the man that came to carry the cross with Jesus Matthew 27 says the rich man of arthea named Joseph came and begged the body of Jesus I'm sorry I had the wrong example what was what was the man's name that carried the cross brother what with him that helped him they compelled Simon I'm sorry about that forgive me but still that applies too right I had I had the wrong scripture here forgive me but let's go to this scripture in Matthew 27 because this applies the same way Matthew 27:57 and when evening was come a rich man from arthea named Joseph who himself was jesus' disciple he went to pilate and begged the body of Jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered and when Joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb which in hun out of the Rock and rolled a great Stone to the door of the seure and departed so you see this is the same principle I'm talking about forgive me about that I'm really sorry about that so he he had a choice too he came and said hey if I choose to do this I'm going to have scorn and people are going to laugh on me because everybody thinks he's a lunatic I'll be on his side if I help him right so he came and made that choice so we have we have a choice Saints Jeremiah 9 let's go to that which we originally called out Jeremiah 9:23 thus sayeth the Lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the Mighty Man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his richest but let him that that glorieth glory in this he that understand and knoweth me that I am the Lord God the Lord Brother which exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the Earth for these things I Delight sayith the Lord you see the choice here let not the rich man pick this let not man pick this economy of Satan or this natural economy pick the spiritual economy amen Joshua said in 20 verse chapter 24 choose ye this day whom you will serve as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord amen so we've got to make that decision right now amen who are you going to serve amen praise the Lord yes sir let me just find a place to close here we do a couple more is this all right amen amen I know this is simple I know that you know but this is where we're at right amen I think so many times this economy this this economy of God we just we're not walking in it like we should that's right right amen there's so much here for you that you can have me that I can have amen I would just thinking the other day and talking to brother Brooks about it you know I just one of the things I'm dealing with is I I want to become who God wants me to become I want to be built into this stature of a perfect man there's things in my life that I see that I got to build into I got to be built into I got to let him do the work yes sir and it's just such a fire shut up in my bones right you ever feel that way or you just ready to burst because you just you just you want to get there so bad you want to get to that point over here and you think you're not making enough progress right you think you're not moving fast enough but he'll do the work right all these principles we talked about follow these principles this is the economy of God this is how we build it and grow in it amen amen praise the Lord amen so we have to choose amen praise the Lord Satan is a god of mixing as we said and look at this definition of mix blend mix up mingle combine put together jumble fuse unite unify join marry and this what Satan's trying to do with his kingdom with his economy with you but the Lord God is a god of Separation yes sir segregation as a matter of fact look at this the segregation is the action or state of setting someone or something apart from other people or things being set apart amen yeah how many times do we say if only I had enough money I could do this or I could do that right God help us God help us you have everything you need it's already within you it's just got to be cultivated God help us we don't need the riches of Mammon to do God's work he'll provide amen yes help us amen acts 8 couple more here as we close oh my Simon acts 8:1 14-22 Simon the Sorcerer he comes among this this Holy Ghost filled group of people and he sees the things that are going on right and Simon the Sorcerer is very very used to Satan's economy he's used to working in that economy right his motives and objectives show forth the truth that's he likes to work in that false economy so he comes along and he sees these things happening in Acts 14 through 22 and he says Hey I want to buy that from you how much can I give you to buy that Holy Ghost so that whoever I pray for can receive it too if only I had enough money I could do this for God and that for God this scriptures are serious here right Peter looks at him and said thy money perish with thee because thou has thought the gift of God may be purchased with money you're never going to get somebody the Holy Ghost through money sir no sir if God has a purpose in your life and he wants you to work in the kingdom of God right and he brother Isaiah probably you know definitely knows this you got travel here and travel there and do this and do that where's all this money come from where's all this funding come from where's all this resources come from God provides right so don't stand there and look at your purpose and think boy I know that God wants me to do this but I don't know how to get there and I don't have money if only I had enough money and things like that you're not going to buy that God will provide amen praise the Lord yes sir Amen Let Us stand here together stretch a little bit there and we'll we'll close in this next portion praise the Lord I'm so thankful for this what God's taught me through this we can just get out of the way right Matthew 19 23 then Jesus said unto his disciples verily I say unto you the rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again I say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of an needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God but his disciples heard it and they were exceedingly amazed saying who can be saved but Jesus beheld them and said unto them with men it is impossible but With God all all things are possible take courage all things are possible through God verse 27 then Peter said unto him behold we have forsaken all to follow thee what shall we have therefore good question isn't it and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory you shall also sit upon 12 Thrones judging the tribes 12 tribes of Israel know you not you shall judge the Earth right Saints shall judge the Earth and everyone that hath forsaken this natural economy houses or Brethren or sisters or fathers or mothers or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive hundredfold and shall inherit Merit everlasting life but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first that's what Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler as well he said you can't you can't mix these two economies he says I've done all these things you know what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus starts ring off these these things of the economy of God keep you know keep these Commandments you know honor your father and other things he says all these things I've done from my youth what lack I yet and Jesus says you've got to sell all you have and follow me you've got to truly sell out everything you have and follow God Amen doesn't necessarily mean that you got to sell all your material possessions sell that desire for those material possessions right and if there's Temptations in your life you know many riches which hardly any us are you know really rich as far as uh money in our own eyes but yet the United States is Rich look compare ourselves we have so much we are so rich so don't put yourself don't think that oh I'm safe because I'm not up here in this millionaire bracket your rich is really I mean you just have abundant riches and you don't have to be a millionaire to have abundant riches compare yourself to the rest of the world so sell that out don't try to mix the two right as we close on this last scripture I just thought this was a blessing in Genesis 1421 and the king of Sodom said unto Abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself and Abram said to the king of Solomon I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth that I will not take from a thread even to a Sho latchet that I will and that I will not make anything that is thine I will not take anything that is thine brother lest thou should us say I have made Abram Rich amen isn't that a good scripture for this economies that we're talking about let's be like Abraham amen the father of Faith hallelu amen as we bow our heads here let's let's close on a word of prayer Lord Jesus with thank you for this time here Lord father this certainly was a battle a real battle Lord uh Satan battling spiritually Lord God but father we claim the blood of Jesus Christ we overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ and Lord God I pray father that something was touched Lord father Lord this word is so rich father and abundance Lord you have your economy is so great for us Lord and Satan wants to keep us from it Lord he wants us Lord God to be bestowed away in this out of sight Lord he just wants us to see what he has to offer he wants us to think Lord just as a blind man who's never had sight in his life doesn't know what it's like to see he doesn't know the riches and the the depth and the glory of seeing Vivid images Lord your nature you've created he doesn't know it and that's what Satan wants us to be he wants us to be blind from birth and never see this glorious economy that you have prepared for us Lord but help us to be bornn again Lord because at that point in time when we are born again Lord receive the holy spirit of God in our soul our eyes are opened to this economy we enter into it we are now workers in the economy we now have that Faith currency to make transactions and to buy the things that we have need of Lord help us Lord Jesus we pray father let this thing burst this open to us Lord father manifest and reveal yourself to us in this great way Lord in this hour for we desire your riches Lord help us father to put away the things of the world the cares of the world Lord father that anything that might be battling In the Flesh Lord the natural world Lord
