offensive or either of you but uh I when he was in the truck I like that looked like brother Troy but praise the Lord y'all know brother farmer comes preach for us that's his Amen brother we appreciate brother Wayne right yes amen and his son is Timothy Michael amen amen amen we know the Bubbies amen so we're appreciate you coming we appreciate you being here amen by the grace of God and we just thank God for the spirit of God in the place and we uh our brother Lee I won't say too much about him I let him say tell it all but we appreciate him we love him amen and uh when we first met him you know I it was hard getting a smile out of him amen but we appreciate serious man and uh he's been such a blessing to us uh brother Troy uh met in there we we we spent time there and um brother Jesse and brother Cam and we've all spent time in in Guyana there Georgetown and other places and we were treated like royalty I mean just a red carpet pulled out and you know we thank God for him he's a close friend of mine uh a god-given gift is what he is to me and I do thank God for him and his family that been so many uh good things I could truly say and I'm not going to prolong the service but uh he's a real missionary a real man of God and uh we just want you to pull from the gift uh and I want him to be Liberty to preach however he wants to preach amen and uh let go and let God have his way y'all know how it is you pull on El sh ey you know you get it right you get it amen so um we're g to ask him to come I I should have gave I should have uh giving him my guitar at the house because he can play guitar and I forgot to give it to him let him use it amen so we don't it's not that we don't believe in music we do believe in music amen we don't have any drums so I use everything I got amen so we praise God for that amen come on brother I don't want to prolong the time but uh I know we're going to be blessed tonight God bless you praise the wonderful name of the Lord amen it's just a joy and a privilege to be here and we truly want to thank God for his loving kindness and it's beyond the human imagination because you know I remember it's a very long time I've being invited to come into the United States since I was like 17 18 years of age and that's over 30 something years ago because you have lots of Minister who came across from the United States and I remember most of the old brothers who you know passed her away before man like brother Jerry Roya brother James walls and brother you know Dan daisley and you know all these brother Henry green and all those brothers and you know since that time you know there was never really a pull to come here and you know God allow brother Isaiah to pass our away and you know he was the one God leap in his heart to do so so we want to thank God for grace and his loving kindness and you know he he said it all you know being a blessing he him God you know is not just being a blessing but is to receive a blessing so he has been a blessing to us and we also had received a blessing because we know know that as Sons and Daughters of God we can pull from each other amen hallelujah because the hour the season that we living in the prophet of God tells us that there is hardly any love left the only place that you could find true love is among the true elected of God hallelujah it goes beyond the flesh hallelujah it's by the Holy Spirit and we truly want to thank God for this season that he has allowed me to be here and you know it was not much planning because when God does something you know it does immediately you know it's just like Abraham when God called Abraham you know he didn't had big plan in his mind but when you're being Inspire of God you move on that inspiration and you know we want to thank God for grace and love and mercy and I do trust God that my coming here that I could be a blessing to you and also receive a blessing you know in Fellowship because the only time that we are here to have Fellowship is this season because we come to realize that we all always in a constant battle we always in a constant Warfare and the proud of God tells the only time that we have to hit back against the devil is now while he's punching at us that's the only chance we can get to hit back at him because we come to realize that we are truly in a battle we are in a Warfare and saints of God is not that we as Believers we love to fight but because God have called us to be in this position we have to fight amen and it's not me and you the individual but it's the God in us because the proph of God tells us that Satan hates anything that God's love Hallelujah because God love you Satan will always be after you praise God so I would like to bring greetings from my wife and family and the church back in Georgetown Guyana and you know we always love the Believers across here and you know it has been a tremendous blessing to us and we truly believe that you know the season that we living in that God have us prepared in a in a raptured season Hallelujah because we know with everything that is happening around the world that God is here with us this evening so I bring you greetings from them and the Believers throughout Guyana because it's not just the church where and the pastor there but Isaiah has been a blessing but throughout the country in Guyana because every August around the the second week of August we have a camp meeting and this year coming will be the 21st annual camp meeting and God has a allowed us to be here remember one time it was the eth of the E of the E and you know I I'm not a person really to look at certain things but that particular Sunday when I went out there the Lord just inspired he said look at your watch I said the eth of the eight of the eight and not knowing that brother Isaiah had in his mind you know what the Lord had inspired to him and I look at it says something you know probably you know just leave it that way but when the Holy Ghost came and ministered the word it was a a a backto back service and one of the the brother the people who were there couldn't understand you know because when God leads you to do things you just don't do it by your own self and when God lead you to do thing hallelujah it's always a blessing and it was a tremendous blessing it was a the presence of God came down and you know it was a life-changing experience to many praise God and it be so happy to be part of that so that blessing you know has what me say emulated in the hearts of many and it's still going on today and through the ministry we believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you know the proud of God tells us in a message the reproach for the cause of the word he tells us that you know that everything comes in its right season I'm going to read what he says here in par in paragraph 81 he says God sets a time and has a purpose for everything that he does how many of you believe that and there is nothing happened just accidentally to those who love the Lord amen and are called according to his calling see we are predestinated and everything works just right amen hallelujah for that because he cannot lie and he said that was so that everything has its time its season and it has its way and God is behind every move how many you believe that God is behind every move it doesn't matter what I feel and what I think and what others think about the whole thing God is being every move and it says sometimes you think that everything is going wrong how many time you feel in your life that things are going wrong and you feel that they're just messed up and there is no way out you say sometimes you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us those things are put Upon Us trials and wonderings it's testing to see how we will react on an action so we want to thank God this evening Hallelujah is a reaction to an actionj and God call us hallelujah of people to be in action God is calling his people praise God to be in action this evening and we truly want to thank God you know it's very difficult for me to really what me say in speaking much and giving introduction and all these things but one of my pet word is come and see amen you know come and see I think that that could be the the greatest introduction you know because to explain things it's very difficult and I'm not good in explaining things but we thank God and I'm so happy to be here and I feel a warm welcome praise God of the holy spirit in his Believers of like Precious faith it doesn't matter how far we from remember we have one Heavenly Father amen hallelujah praise God it's one spirit it's one Faith it's one baptism so culture doesn't matter when it comes to the grace of God in our life Hallelujah because we are bought by his Precious Blood Hallelujah so we truly happy and thankful to be here and you know we trust the few days being with you that we could all receive a blessing from God and we come to realize that when you think about this message this ministry that God has given to us is not about human personality it's all about the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's all about him and when you look at our prophet he didn't had his own personality because he always points you to Christ and he says every true servant or any true prophet of God he always points you back back to the word and saints of God that is the greatest thing that we could do because Paul whatever Paul did Hallelujah he was pointing us to Christ Jesus Hallelujah says follow me as I follow Christ praise God so we are have people of great hope and we have a great privilege and let us take the best advantage of the privilege that God has given onto US how many you willing to do that praise God let us all just stand together as we turn to our Bibles in know the book of St Mark chapter 8 reading from Verses 4 throughout 38 praise the name of the Lord and i' like to speak on a little thought this evening um separating separating yourself between your feelings and your faith hallelujah how many you believe that amen the time has come when you know there many time we have feelings Hallelujah but you know the fate of God goes beyond my feelings it goes beyond your feelings and feelings go as far as the flesh can go but Faith goes beyond flesh Faith goes beyond reasoning praise God and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and a gospel the same shall save it amen for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the world the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give an exchange for his soul whatsoever therefore whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my word in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in glory of his father with the Holy Angels gracious God Hallelujah and Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank thee For Your Love Lord we want to thank you for your mercies oh God that you can allow us Lord to come into your presence Lord this evening Lord and we recognize you promis in your word whereever two or three are gathered together Lord in your name that you're there in the midst to bless Lord we pray God that you may bless us richly Lord oh God as we come to Feast on around your table with your word that you have provided for us Lord we give you the praise and the honor and the glory in Jesus name amen praise God you may be seated saints of God this time and the season that we living in we see that the world is falling apart Hallelujah we see churches are falling apart we see homes are falling apart and we see individuals are falling apart Hallelujah but Jesus Christ Still Remains the same yesterday today and forever and we come to recognize when God called us and place us here upon the face of the Earth it was his program it was his mind it was not me and you wanted to serve God hallelujah but God placed in us his life his Gene his seed and because of that we could not have helped ourselves huah other than to come in God's provided way although we know that we were born in sin and we were shapen in iniquity saints of God that was just the adamic nature Hallelujah but having the seed of God in us hallelujah we come to realize that God has placed Us in time and in season and as we the quote that we read just now God he knows the time and he knows the season and nothing is out to cater with God and even us being here this evening God knows and he recognize that it would have been this time it would have been this season you know many time man will try to plan and we could be good planners we can be good thinkers but if we don't have the leadership of the Holy Spirit to come and to Grace us and to bless us with that leadership we all be in vain all we will be so tired and we'll work ourselves out but saints of God we come to realize in this hour we want to be under the leadership of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah we want to be sons being led by the spirit of God so we come to realize the scripture that we read here he was calling his disciples and they and you know he was telling them of the time and the season and how they have to take up the cross and follow him because it calls for a total separation from from the world and the things of the world and when we come to realize it's not man bringing that separation it's the word of God because the Bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and as you hear the word of God hallelujah it brings you into the revelation of his word and you could a person you a person can only live hallelujah what is being revealed to them if something is not being revealed to them they will react and they will act differently but we come to realize the proud of God tells us also is not you know our is the person's attitude towards us but is our attitude towards the individual so when you have the spirit of Christ inside of you saints of God your attitude and your whole disposition it will be different the prod of God says there in a message God's word call for total separation from unbelief it's a 64121 paragraph 59 he tells us but when a man is born in the world for a Believer he becomes a Nazarite amen when he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word amen that is what God want us to separate from anything that is contrary to the word and he says a total separation Jesus said I come to separate a man from his wife he said tear up a family now to the car minded they say these are very hard statements Hallelujah but the Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah this is words of Promise amen hallelujah praise God and he that would take up his cross and follow me is not worthy to be called mine amen how many of you will have taken up your cross and follow him the only way that you can be worthy of this gospel is to surrender your whole life before him Hallelujah a separation from everything anything and it's very striking says separate from church amen from a community from a belief amen or from family or anything that would stand between you and believing the entire word of God it's not just the word of God but the entire word of God many time we say that we are message Believers but do we entirely believe the word of God Amen just as how the pr of God hallelujah he spoke on Deliverance but he says not just a Deliverance but a total Deliverance a lot of people are being delivered but they need a total Deliverance a lot of a lot of people say they believe the message of the hour but saints of God they don't believe the entire word of God hallelujah that is why you have so much intellectuals following the message and when the intellectual they follow the message they don't entirely believe the fullness of the word of God hallelujah that is why today you have a lot of scoffers and mockers around because they don't believe the fullness of the word in entirety when you believe the fullness of the word in entirety anything that God says hallelujah it will be separated from the world Hallelujah because you are Sons and Daughters of God praise God say anything that wouldn't stand anything that would stand between you and believing the entire word he says if your soul will not punctuate every promise for this hour with a amen there is something wrong somewhere you need a separation saints of God we need a separation Hallelujah this is between life and death Hallelujah and we come realize today when you when you truly become a form believer in Christ Jesus you don't think about your family ties you don't think of this Blood Hallelujah but you think Hallelujah about the Life of Christ Jesus the holy ghost coming inside of you Hallelujah because there will be coming a time you know many time we sing that that little chorus I'm on my way to canaan's land if my mama don't come if my papa don't come he don't hinder me but when I was a little boy when I hear that if my mama don't come and papa don't come it didn't hinder me so what kind of song they singing and I love my mother I love my father so much but when you grow up and you receive the revelation of this word there is nothing that can separate you from the love of God hallelujah no father no mother no brother Hallelujah no wife no husband because we believe what a proud of God say is God first Hallelujah then your family after and then you the individual so it calls for separating separating yourself between your feelings and your faith and there are many times we work on feeling instead of faith and Satan like to work on the feeling he like to work on these five senses Hallelujah the five outer senses and the five inner senses Hallelujah he will try to get up you with memory reasoning and conscience Hallelujah and all these different things but saints of God the True Believer we don't go on reasoning we don't go on memory we go in believing what the word of God tells us hallelujah because all things are possible to him that believeth because we cannot reason against the enemy and every every time something happen we'll try to reason and then it will bring up memory it will bring up feelings and all these things that is why the old man has to die out Hallelujah and you need to be separated from the world and the things of the world and coming into Christ Jesus in fullness Hallelujah in a message the power of transformation 65 10:31 M paragraph 77 he says sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on Earth he says to you to take your position that God has called you to this is very hard it's a hard say yes that sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on Earth to you to take your position that God has called you amen he says I'm sure you can read between the lines that's what I'm saying see sometimes the very dearest person on Earth you have to shake hands with them just take your position in Christ Hallelujah to where God has called you see but what is God doing he's transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else because it's his way of doing it see by the renewing of your mind to obey the word of God Amen and he didn't stop there he says regardless of what the price is amen a lot of people want to have good things they want to have nice things they want to have expensive things but they're not willing to pay the price amen hallelujah how many you willing to pay the price this evening to serve God in the right way to separate yourself from every feeling from every thought Hallelujah to have the faith of God remember God called us to be sons of Abraham and we have that abrahamic Faith Hallelujah to be separated from everything Hallelujah that is contrary to the promise of God word and we see the season that we living in Hallelujah is that that same season is here again where the promise was fulfilled then hallelujah and it's being fulfilled now Hallelujah and we are the we are in the time of the very manifestation of the fullness of the word of God because the word tells us that when the seventh angel shall begin to song all the mystery of God shall be finished amen hallelujah and we come to realize there no new revelation upon the face of the Earth Hallelujah all what is required of us is already given Hallelujah but the only problem is that some of us we haven't gone into that place yet is how you can surrender yourself to the word of God hallelujah and the word of God can come and be manifested inside of you amen hallelujah so that is why be recognized the time and season that we living in regardless of what the price is if you're willing to pay the price saints of God then you'll wear the Crum with him him you know we normally would say that you know if you have a a a little battle you'll have a little V Victory Hallelujah if you have a big battle you expect a big victory but if you don't have no battles how are you going to expect victories in your life you see God didn't call us to be cowards but God call us to be Mighty Gentile Warriors because he knew that we have an enemy Hallelujah and the enemy want to project himself as God hallelujah he want to rise above the most high but we come to recognize today Hallelujah that no devil in hell can't stop a true predestinated seed of God hallelujah praise God from living the way that God would have him to live amen hallelujah we got to stay in the presence of God we know the Bible tells us in Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood Hallelujah but against principalities and against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take on the whole arm of God that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand Paul said when you stand make sure that you stand and stand it's a double shorty that where you standing and saints of God we come to recognize that we truly believe that this message is a Vindicated message amen hallelujah praise God and it doesn't matter what people say you know what it is because it's a life that is worthy of this God gospel Hallelujah we living in a time and season when there are so many things are happening and when we come to Eliz in the time of the children of Israel when God had brought them out from the land of Egypt praise God many of them were under the ministry of Moses and when they came out from the land of Egypt some they stood with Moses and some of them cor and dayon they were pointing them back into Egypt and there were some Hallelujah they were murmuring at the Wayside and it's the very same thing you're happening today because we are in an exod in a journey and we are in the final stage of the journey Hallelujah but we want to thank God for this final stage Hallelujah do you know that we are finalists amen hallelujah and God keeps the best for the last and there is where you have all the tricks there's where you have all all the big games all the big betting and everything that is happening but saints of God God is not betting on us he knows Hallelujah he knows what he placed there Hallelujah than you Lord and there's no devil in hell that can stop the bride of Christ Jesus the proud of God says nothing is out of cater with the bride sir because the bride have his mind and she know exactly what to do with the word because she has been separated from the world and the things of the world Hallelujah separated from church reality separated from so many things and coming into Christ Jesus saints of God we come to realize many people will wake up one morning to just recognize that they just have a message concept this message is not a concept this message is a reality this message is God to us and because people have a concept it can change but when you have a true Revelation from God it cannot change Hallelujah so Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we got to separate ourselves from every humanistic idea from every concept Hallelujah from whatever we think and whatever man is saying and get to this unadulterated word of God Amen because this word of God is ordained to see us through amen hallelujah many times people feel that we can preserve and we can keep the word and we can defend this message saints of God is this message defending us amen we can't defend this message this message is defending us this is what we are depending upon Hallelujah this is the fullness of the word of God this is this message is God's love towards each and every one of us here this evening hallelujah praise God God so we truly want to thank God for his great love towards us we know sometimes the the devil may come and try to put something upon you he may you may pray and you know he may want to make you feel sicker and all these things that is the trick of the enemy Hallelujah but remember when that takes place we come to realize that God is on the scene Hallelujah your faith is is is upon the word of God you know the part in this message here The Hours come paragraph 21 he tells us that's what the devil tries to do all the time burn you up on something make you sicker when you prayed for does it happen sometime you're being prayed for and you feel more sick you feel you know that you're more torn up but that's the time you need to believe God that's a time you need to hold on because something is happening Hallelujah and the devil want to come and work on your mind to let you feel well you know what kind of Faith you have you've been prayed for now you're feeling more terrible than ever but saints of God that is the time you need to stand to let the devil know that your faith is is on the word of God hallelujah your faith is not on intellectual conception your faith is not on your on your feelings Hallelujah but is upon the promised word of God so that is why we have to separate between your feelings from your faith hallelujah praise God he says make you sicker when you prayed for make you think you lost your experience with God there's so many times you can be going through situations in your life and then you feel well you know you that you that you lost your experience with God and the devil is only lying to you sir that is what a proud of God says do you know David what the word of go what did did David said David had a condition but what he said he L Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation Hallelujah there time not that he loses salvation Hallelujah but you find yourself so down and so low Hallelujah that it takes the grace of God that is why I always tell the Believers back home when you want quality Fellowship don't go to a those backsliders and fellowship because when you go just you put two backslider to fellowship with the other when you finish is the most miserable condition that you could find but you always find birds of fed want flock together but saints of God we must be wiser than that amen hallelujah two persons in who is in defeat they'll only talk the licks that they get and they get robbed they could never talk about something good I even if you if they're being beaten fairly they still want to find something that you know they're being cheated out or somebody cheat them that is that is failures Hallelujah but when you are a winner hallelujah it's a different thing amen no matter how badly you are beaten if you are the winner your body language has a difference amen it's a big difference Hallelujah the man who may lose he may not get so battered but just because he lost the battle you could feel he's down and out saints of God God have some battle scar Sons and Daughters this evening because if you're in battle you must get scars amen H this is not an army where you you're a soldier and you're just in the kitchen God didn't call us to be soldiers in the kitchen but God called us to be soldiers on the battlefield Hallelujah and this bride that Christ Jesus have this is a bride on the battlefield Hallelujah because Satan is after you all the time but we truly want to thank God for his grace his love and his Mercy praise God when the devil want to make you think that you lost your experience the pr of God say he's lying to you the time come when you have to stand on God's word amen hallelujah he says stand alone amen but when the time comes stand there amen there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith and that's the time it is tonight Hallelujah the time come that when the when these Hebrew boys had to seal their testimony by a fiery furnace he says I can see them that morning he says I can see them that morning there come a great time in babon the king said now look we've got some Fanatics down there hallelujah hallelujah Listen to I like this part and they're causing us a little bit trouble with their religion they're causing a little bit of trouble with their religion so we'll just build a furnace fire over them and they heated it seven times hotter than it ever was heat and we'll burn that out of them you cannot burn out Holy Ghost Fire because he that which is in you is greater than he that which is in the world saints of God are they not the same Fate The Same Spirit that was in shedrach mishak and abedo is here tonight and that the world and religion is trying to do the very same thing and they're calling you fanatics but if we be Fanatics let us be Fanatics for this word amen hallelujah not for the word and the things of the world Hallelujah we want to thank God for grace in this evening time Hallelujah that God have a people that is predestinated hallelujah for ordained before the foundation of the world hallelujah praise God that can live the word of God hallelujah that can be with him Luke Chapter 21:35 tells us for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that he may be accounted worthy to escape all these things Hallelujah that shall that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man how can we withstand these things we need the Life of Christ we need to have a true genuine Hallelujah experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our life not just a message concept A lot of time people go well I'm 20 year in a message I'm 30 year in a message when Paul came in his time there are many who believed but he says since you believe have you receiv received and when you when you preach about these things today people say you're crazy you're contrary what you want to do they call you Pentecostal yes sir Pentecost is an experience and because they don't have an experience with God that is why they just live in the intellect and if you live in an intellectual realm then Trouble Comes Satan can always get you amen hallelujah but if you live by the leadership of the Holy Spirit God inside of you there's no devil in hell that can stop you there's no demon in Hell Hallelujah that can get at you hallelujah what a time what a season that we are living in Hallelujah the proud of God tells Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 187 he was giving us a little thing here about Adam he said how did he what happened in the prefigure he opened Adam's sight and took part of his flesh which was Adam to make Eve the Bible has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on Creeds she cannot stand on denomination she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it she was taken from Christ amen that is where we have to stand the bride has to be the word for he is the word yes amen so for us to be the word we got to be separated from every condition we got to be separated from a message concept and come into the reality of this messag Hallelujah because you find that back home some folks may tell you and they're so proud that they're in the message but they tell you well my grandmother used to come to church and my grandfather and my mother and my dad and everybody and now I come to this church but they don't have an experience with God that is why you see so many things happening it doesn't matter how good children we have and how good parents we are we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah we come to realize it's not just the children delinquency as the prod of God says it's also parent delinquency because if you don't have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost how would you live a life before your family how would you stand to minister the word of God it takes the Life of Christ in you saints of God this world is full of trouble the God of this evil age is getting our grips upon people amen hallelujah amen and not on the outside right within the framework of the church on Amen you know if the devil is not after you then he's got you ready amen you got to thank God when the devil is after you and you have all these trials and these battles when you have these persecutions and trials in your life because the proud of God said God is allowing you giving you an opportunity that you can have victories in your life amen thank you Lord because he wants us to be Overcomers and only Overcomers can reign with him only Overcomers can make it there so God want us to overcome Hallelujah and God want us that we can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in his life amen hallelujah and he is more willing to give it to us and how we want it just think of it how much God love us and he wants us to be like him but the greatest hindrance huah is not a pastor the brother next to you or the Deacon or the song leader somebody but the greatest hindrance is me I myself amen Allelujah when it comes of us receiving the word of God saints of God we got to separate ourselves by the word of God with from our feelings with our faith amen hallelujah because this message this gospel it stands in a power and a demonstration of the holy spirit amen it's not how good we feel that we are as a part of God says is not a good behavior but it's standing on the word of God because all that good behavior many who who could have outlive or live a righteous life more than the scribes and the Pharisees amen and Christ Jesus said that if your righteousness cannot exceed them you can't make it but that righteousness that he was talking about saints of God was not a man's righteousness it was the righteousness of Christ Jesus because man's righteousness don't put you nowhere man's righteousness is your self-righteous that you feel you're righteous more than anybody else and you feel that you better more than anybody else well this message don't have no personality and anybody around the message want to have a personality well it's a difficult position amen because you cannot take the position of Christ amen hallelujah because he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the king of kings he is the Lord of lords Hallelujah and we truly want to thank God for his grace and his love and mercy so the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on Creed she cannot stand on denomination she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it and she was taken from Christ yes amen amen Paul says to me to live is Christ amen so what are we living on what are we living for is because of the grace of God in our life that we can come that way in Genesis okay let me read this code just before I go to the scripture the proud of God was telling here in a message my new ministry paragraph e95 he says now listen to this God God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I God have it this way that is why we need a separation from the world and the things of the world away from religion away from every concept God has so arranged it this program cannot move without you and I and as long as we are not doing what God lead us to do we are paralyzing his Pro program but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen then we are in God's will doing his program hallelujah amen it's not my will but his will be done Christ Jesus here on Earth hallelujah hallelujah going to the Garden of get enem me coming to his time where you have to fulfill hallelujah what he was being sent for humanly when he feel the pangs and the pain he says father let this cup pass from me that was the human feelings but when he realized his position he said Lord nevertheless not my will Lord but your will be done and since of every true son and daughter of God has to come to that Amen to separate your feelings from your faith when it comes to this word of God if we don't do that we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are in God's will doing his program amen we want to be in God's will doing his program not a man mating amen hallelujah one time the proud of God was saying I can't remember the exact message but he was talking about Peter he says Peter wasn't called to serve the ministry he was called to serve God and many time we feel well you know it's the church and it's the Ministries and we and we have no committed life to our Heavenly Father we must have a committed life it's not just coming to church and and what we doing becomes a ritual God don't believe in ritual whatever we do it got to come from the heart it got to come from Deep with inside of us because it's part of us hallelujah what a time of what a season that we are living in saints of God it's a Down to Earth time hallelujah praise His wonderful name in Genesis chapter 339 just a little reference here he said it was between Abraham and lot where they had this separation he said is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand then I will go to the right or if thou depart from the right hand then I will go to the left it was between Abraham and lot one was a carnal-minded Believer Hallelujah and the other was truly elected and called of God and the one that was being called and elected of God he gave the other one to make the choice that's what God always does he have his he have his way and he said this is the way walking it Hallelujah but then people want to take a permissive will but true Sons and Daughters of God will never want to get into a permissive will they will want to be in a perfect and acceptable will of God in separating don't matter what the price you have to pay lot was just looking at a final Pastor he was looking of how rich he will become because of the grass land and the cattle that he'll be having but Abraham was not looking beneath he was looking aboveall Hallelujah that he called him to be a father of many nation that he will receive a blessing so we're not looking at what we can achieve now and what we could have and want to be smart God call us to be smart God call us to be honest God call us to be righteous God call us to be holy Hallelujah God call us to be Sons and Daughters to be obedient to his word and when we can be that way in his provided way saints of God everything God will give to us hallelujah in a message proof of his resurrection paragraph 71 if and if we had to stand it alone part stand it we Ain looking for friends or who you have on your side it's not the multitude having on your side many time people feel the multitude is right but you don't go by the multitude when you look through the scripture most of the time or all the time the multitude is always wrong amen but because they are big in numbers they seem to be powerful but God is not in numbers Hallelujah God is in Revelation and if we had to stand it alone stand it for it's God's word every man that ever got anywhere had to stand alone on his convictions only that's not in Partnership the Lord there is only one who will walk it with you and that's him who made a statement Jesus he's the one that will TR the valley with you isn't that so he will go through every bear patch and Climb Every Mountain by your side yoke yourself up with him not with an organization not in a multitude or the different Clans and groups around the message yoke yourself up with him for my yoke is light my burden are easy don't be Yol up with the things of the world don't be yoke up in different societies and organization yoke yourself singly with the Lord Lord Jesus Christ amen in order that you can do it believe and see the resurrection amen beli and see this message has resurrection power amen amen hallelujah in the rising of the Sun the pr of God said only the gerat th seed can come in the resurrection a dramatized seed has to be separated from all the other seeds and we want to thank God that that this message Hallelujah is bringing us into that place that we are a separated people unto him and when we can be a separated people unto him there is no devil in hell can stop you amen hallelujah in Romans chapter 1 Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God Amen he was being separated and so is every believer so is every brother so is every sister so is everyone that comes into the house of God believing him Hallelujah God call us we got to be separated from the world and we also have to be addicted to this gospel hallelujah amen when people are addicted you know when people are when a man is addicted to alcohol when you look at him you could tell you could say that man is a rum a rum man or he's a alcoholic the way he looks the way and they carry scars also because the way if they stop drinking from for a whole month you look at them you could still see the scars on them something about them what about you as Believers this evening amen we should be battle scar Sons and Daughters of God that our world we should be addicted to Christ so much that there's nothing in the world can have a whole upon us when a man or woman is truly addicted look at those drug addict they will try to do anything to feel good Amen to feel nice if they got a teeth from their parents or somebody to sell just to feel good they will do it they have no consideration so our sons and daughters about why should we have consideration how the flesh feel or others feel when it come to our Salvation when it come to us serving God when the word of God say who can separate us from the love of God saints of God the season that we living in we come to recognize that this is the best time for every believer amen it's the worst time for those who cannot believe and take on the fullness of the word of God what kind of people are we to be this evening as Sons and Daughters of God stay with the fullness of the word of God that he has given unto us saints of God it comes down to the bottom line of everything that as sons of Abraham the pr of God says as son of Abraham or seeds of Abraham you cannot dispute with God you don't dispute the word of God you just believe the word of God Abraham never disputed God Abraham came and Abraham just believed what the word of God was saying hallelujah in a message he saw by himself paragraph 207 he says God by Sovereign election has called Abraham's seed yes amen then if that type of life that was on inside of that blood cell was upon Abraham who called the impossible possible called The Impossibles that they would be because God said so what kind of people are the Seed of Abraham amen Abraham was a separated man from his home from his from his Kindred and he came out a land that God would show unto him hallelujah praise God it's not that Abraham didn't have any feelings it's not that we don't have any feelings tonight but saints of God we have to separate between our feelings from our faith amen hallelujah praise God so what kind of people are the Seed of Abraham he says oh don't miss this please don't he says I feel it's coming from the top of my head look he says then if you are Abraham's seed you can't dispute with God am amen Abraham's seed is a part of this spirit for God gave Abraham a sign of circumcision cutting off the flesh cutting off the flesh so saints of God when the Holy Ghost comes inside of you it's a circumcision it cuts off all The Unwanted flesh it cuts off everything that is not worthy of this gospel and anything that is not worthy of this gospel it is a hard saying it could be your wife your husband your your boss your or whoever it is hallelujah it will have to go and you will stand on the word of God hallelujah praise is wonderful name then if you are Abraham's seed you can't dispute with God Abraham's seed is a part of the spirit for God gave Abraham a sign of circumcision cutting off the flesh for a witness he had received him amen hallelujah listen to this now in this last days has took the Holy Ghost and circumcised every believer yes of cutting off all doubts and unbelief Amen to believe God's word word is pure and holy and is the truth hallelujah circumcision cutting away all unbelief everything Cut Loose every shore line saying God I believe you live or die sink or drunk it's your word I believe amen then see what I mean amen amen hallelujah what a season that we are living in stay with this word no matter what it it costs you amen Hallelujah whatever it takes I I remember one time I think it was in 1997 I had tree services that day and after the first service the Lord tremendously blessed and coming out in the in the room I said God whatever it takes for me to draw draw closer to you to be what You' have me to be Lord let me be whatever it takes without no consideration just because of how I felt and brother when I was going to preach in the second service I get in a head-on collision with a pickup truck and I was driving my van and he came up a one way and I had no way to escape the only way I the I the wind screen from the vehicle was broken I I had to blow the suit on the show shoulder hit on and I came out of the vehicle but then the doors all the seat was pushed right up to the roof I was out of that vehicle so some persons were passing say who was driving that vehicle I said look the look the fellow standing down there the vehicle right it was written off you know I feel the pain of everything so and the first thought came to me on whatever it takes amen that is how it is many time we say things but do we really mean did I really I didn't really mean in that way but I say Lord whatever it takes so there that is why we have to be careful of what we say with the words that we'll use because in our Zeal we can say things and do things and God will take us at our word hallelujah and when we don't really mean it we we we'll pay for the whole thing but then realize that you know you said it well Lord I really mean what I said so any True Believer when you come to realize the seriousness of the word of God hallelujah you'll want to cut loose everything of this world and to serve God in the way that he will have you to saints of God I want to tell you this evening let our conviction be upon the word of God finally 2 Corinthians 6:17 tells us wherefore come out from among them and be separated said the Lord and touch not the unclean thing that I will receive you so it's separation tonight by the grace of God separating yourself between your feelings and your faith just think about this thought Hallelujah and see the way how God would have us to be amen it's a total separation amen so saints of God you know let us continue serving God the way that he will have of us because we come to realize this message is not a big show but I want to let you know there's a big Showdown Hallelujah there is a big Showdown sir and God is preparing his bride he's preparing a people that is willing for that great and final showdown so separate yourself between your feeling and your faith and let God have his way may God richly bless you Hallelujah Lord Jesus praise God we can we can sing this chorus praise God he's alive and well living in me to tell oh he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that he is the sa he's the same yesterday to day and forever Jesus is Alive and Well one more time he's alive and well living in me to

feelings got in front of my faith amen and I know that that that word was especially for me you know because people of God it's so easy just like that and it could have really been more drama to that
