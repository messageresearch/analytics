[7:28] appreciate all of you and by the grace
[7:30] of God let us read from the seventh
[7:33] verse for God has not given us the
[7:36] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[7:40] and of sound mind now I want you to
[7:42] repeat that with me for God have not
[7:46] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[7:49] and of love and of a sound mind is that
[7:52] all right be not thou therefore ashamed
[7:57] of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me
[8:00] his prisoner but be thou partakers taker
[8:04] of the Affliction of The Gospel
[8:05] According to the power of God who have
[8:09] saved us and called us with a holy
[8:12] calling not according to our works but
[8:16] according to his own purpose and Grace
[8:19] which was given us in Christ Jesus oh I
[8:22] love this before the world
[8:25] began but is now made manifest by the
[8:30] preaching of Our Savior Jesus Christ who
[8:33] have abolished death and have brought
[8:36] life and immortality to life through the
[8:41] gospel is that all right amen so we
[8:44] realize by the grace of God Amen we're
[8:47] working with
[8:49] sanity versus
[8:51] Insanity uh let us pray Heavenly Father
[8:54] God we come before you Lord Jesus we
[8:57] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[8:58] Lord you been been so good to us you've
[9:01] been better to us Lord than we've been
[9:02] to ourselves there's no place no place
[9:05] Lord nowhere I can express my gratitude
[9:09] Lord the English language cannot even
[9:11] express Lord what I feel in my heart but
[9:14] I'm so thankful that you know what my
[9:16] heart speak and we pray tonight Lord
[9:19] that you bless the service this this
[9:21] evening bless each and every one of us
[9:23] the hearer of the word oh God the doers
[9:26] of the word oh God bless those who who
[9:28] are visiting being blessed Lord I pray
[9:30] that you give us eyes to see ears to
[9:33] hear and a heart to receive in Jesus
[9:37] Christ name we pray amen you may be
[9:39] seated I just want to say by the grace
[9:42] of God that uh I I I'm just going to try
[9:46] to take my time so that you can fully
[9:48] understand uh where we're
[9:50] going we realize amen according to the
[9:53] message of the hour that uh the world uh
[9:56] at large would be totally insane
[10:00] and the only people who will not be
[10:02] insane are those who are following the
[10:05] truth of the word of God now you say
[10:08] well Brothers what do you mean uh we're
[10:11] living in a society or in a world Amen
[10:14] where people are calling right wrong and
[10:16] wrong right amen America as a as is a as
[10:20] a leading nation has Bas basically
[10:23] spread her
[10:25] Insanity uh all over the world and we
[10:28] realize amen that we're living in a
[10:30] people a a time and an age where people
[10:34] don't even know they're insane it's like
[10:37] the like like the Bible said according
[10:39] to Revelations 3 blind and don't know it
[10:43] naked and don't know it amen and if you
[10:46] was to tell them that they were blind or
[10:48] naked they would be very offended uh
[10:51] with and by those words and will act
[10:55] more than likely in a rational way it's
[10:58] only because are
[11:00] insane you know I believe that scripture
[11:03] where it says lay suddenly your hands on
[11:06] no man because God knew that in our age
[11:10] people would be H H uh so demon
[11:13] possessed to they really believe that
[11:16] the demons are
[11:18] themselves now I want you to realize and
[11:21] I'm going to be reading some stuff here
[11:22] so I I want you to know that I'm going
[11:24] on on two sides of this thing so I'm I'm
[11:26] depending on the Holy Ghost to to to let
[11:29] me preaching the way he gave it to me
[11:31] amen because we are living in a day
[11:33] where Insanity a lot of time people
[11:36] don't uh you know I I'll be honest with
[11:38] you I I call people insane that drop
[11:41] jumps out of airplanes just for the
[11:44] fun I mean to me that makes no sense to
[11:47] me that's tempting God you know but
[11:50] people are so uh you know involved in
[11:54] that they they love that Adrenaline Rush
[11:57] well you know when I was a boy before I
[11:59] got got saved I used to dream falling
[12:01] off of a cliff and I didn't like that
[12:04] Adrenaline
[12:05] Rush not even in my dream so why would I
[12:09] do it while while
[12:11] awake you know what I'm saying the only
[12:14] way I would drop out of a plane or jump
[12:16] out of a plane is is that is going down
[12:18] and I've got a parachute and a
[12:21] prayer right so you know you look at
[12:24] these things and you say well brother
[12:26] Brooks you know it's okay I mean what
[12:28] what would make a Man spent so much time
[12:31] uh uh in his life climbing Mount
[12:35] Everest and if he wanted to find God he
[12:38] could easily find him in the
[12:41] word you know but we find out that
[12:43] people don't they don't have a balance
[12:46] nowadays and and it's the people who are
[12:49] insane that gets most of the credit I
[12:52] could remember the time when my wife was
[12:54] having Gracie and she had a rough time
[12:57] and we was reading the scriptures amen
[12:59] when when uh HH and the and the doctor
[13:02] got upset and my wife and I was
[13:04] rejoicing saying thank you Jesus thank
[13:07] you Jesus for delivering the baby he
[13:09] said Jesus didn't deliver that baby he
[13:11] said I
[13:12] did and to this day I wonder where that
[13:16] doctor is I I I know now that he was
[13:19] insane because only an insane person can
[13:23] make such a statement as that y'all hear
[13:26] what I'm saying now insanity or to be
[13:29] insane is not to is is one that is not
[13:33] of a sound mind you know mentally
[13:36] deranged and often time we think that
[13:39] the people who are in the insane as
[13:42] silent are the ones that are insane but
[13:44] really our government is
[13:49] insane I mean you think about the people
[13:52] who are now gambling and playing Russian
[13:54] roulette with the lives of the world
[13:57] with nuclear weapons and nuclear bombs
[14:00] as if they're God
[14:02] themselves Hitler was insane though he
[14:05] was an intelligent man he was insane
[14:09] come on
[14:10] somebody now I I want you to realize
[14:13] because I want you to understand there's
[14:15] another kind of insanity but there a
[14:17] good
[14:20] crazy right there's another kind there's
[14:22] a flip side to the one one is a negative
[14:25] the other one is a
[14:27] positive all right Paul said I worship
[14:30] in the way that they call heresy that
[14:33] word mean
[14:34] crazy I worship in the way that the
[14:37] world the caral Mind call
[14:41] crazy and if it it it's okay it's all
[14:45] right to be that kind of crazy crazy for
[14:48] Jesus crazy for the blood crazy for the
[14:51] cross it's all right about that but when
[14:55] we find out and uh we were talking
[14:58] Brother Rich earlier day I forgot what's
[15:00] the lady name who who put prayer out of
[15:04] school y'all heard him because I can't
[15:06] even say it but she it's a known fact
[15:10] that she was so against Christianity
[15:13] till she in prayer and all those things
[15:15] in school she petition and
[15:18] won what was so ironic about the whole
[15:21] thing is that her son later on in life
[15:23] became a
[15:25] Christian and then they found her
[15:27] somewhere dead cut up in
[15:31] pieces now if she got that treatment on
[15:34] Earth what do you think her treatment
[15:36] will be in
[15:37] hell because you must realize that
[15:41] Disobedience to the word of God is
[15:44] insanity willful
[15:47] Disobedience to the word of God is
[15:51] insanity you derin you're out of your
[15:55] mind because you're not thinking about
[15:58] the consequence
[16:01] quences hello don't get quiet on me now
[16:06] Paul the word of God tells us to Timothy
[16:08] he says now God has not given us a
[16:10] spirit of fear cuz fear is torment
[16:13] torment makes you
[16:15] insane when something's tormenting you
[16:18] you make ra uh rational or irrational
[16:22] decisions sometime we do anything to
[16:24] stop the devil from tormenting us
[16:29] sometime those things that we'll do are
[16:32] are not right with the word come
[16:35] on and at that point in time he put you
[16:38] in a temporary insane
[16:42] position because at that moment you'll
[16:44] not right in your
[16:48] mind come on
[16:50] somebody you look at the way the world
[16:53] is driving the young people into
[16:56] Insanity where they loving to keep and
[16:59] you know you know the more violent the
[17:01] the the the game is the the the happier
[17:04] they are it it just seemed like it f
[17:07] feel it feels something on the inside
[17:09] what it is they got an insane
[17:13] demon hello somebody amen whenever you
[17:17] can get to the place where you have no
[17:20] fear in taking another man's life you
[17:23] are insane whether it's by listen the
[17:26] Bible said that you'll be judged not by
[17:29] just what you do but by having pleasure
[17:32] in those that do the
[17:34] evil oh come on somebody is the
[17:39] truth amen listen what the prophet of
[17:42] God says in
[17:44] demonology he said many times you can
[17:47] see a
[17:49] person maybe of
[17:51] insanity now they may be a converted
[17:57] person filled with the Holy Spirit and
[18:01] yet be totally
[18:03] insane see that's right that has nothing
[18:07] to do with the
[18:09] soul it's a
[18:12] Tormentor Now understand he's going to
[18:14] say what he see sometimes that Tormentor
[18:17] them or God sometimes permits Satan to
[18:21] put sickness on you as a whip to bring
[18:25] you back to the house of God
[18:29] when you dis disobey
[18:32] him so he gives us torment us he will
[18:35] allow
[18:36] torment to torment you until you get
[18:39] back on your knees and say God forgive
[18:42] me in other words God will allow a devil
[18:46] to drive Insanity the spirit of insanity
[18:49] on you until you realize because
[18:52] understand it's your spirit that he's
[18:53] working with but your soul is
[18:57] say anybody you know what I'm talking
[19:01] about God is The Keeper of the
[19:05] Mind Isaiah 26 and3 says Thou will keep
[19:10] him in perfect peace whose mind is
[19:14] stayed on thee
[19:17] because he trusteth in
[19:21] thee huh amen if we trust God and do
[19:25] whatever we could do to keep our minds
[19:28] on him God will give us perfect peace
[19:31] hallu you see I experience that even
[19:34] today just keeping my mind stared on him
[19:38] and it's been a peaceful day it doesn't
[19:41] mean that the winds have been blowing
[19:43] and the storms have been coming but by
[19:45] the grace of God my
[19:48] mind has been kept in
[19:53] peace see and like I said there's a good
[19:56] worship you know you look at people and
[19:59] you know you can see they're not
[20:01] happy you know you can see the the
[20:04] torment on the inside you know and and
[20:07] and and and and they just don't know
[20:08] what to do with themselves you know it's
[20:10] like you know and and and I don't I
[20:12] don't know I hope nobody have any
[20:14] tattoos and I'm I'm not I'm not against
[20:17] you but as a as a person I I realize
[20:19] that people they they don't take their
[20:22] bodies as being sacred anymore there was
[20:24] a time your body was a sacred thing
[20:27] whether you were saved or not God
[20:30] saved something about your body you
[20:33] cherished but now people are so insane
[20:36] they're so empty they they they don't
[20:38] know what else to do and they're writing
[20:41] all kinds of
[20:43] graffiti on their bodies they call them
[20:47] tattoos but if you go to the inner city
[20:50] and see all that stuff on the wall what
[20:52] do you think this is
[20:55] ghetto right this is where violence lay
[20:59] this is a dangerous city here you see
[21:01] what I'm saying why because it's Lawless
[21:04] they're out of
[21:06] control come on somebody and so when you
[21:09] see these things and these people get
[21:11] into these things they don't realize
[21:14] that mentally they're out of
[21:19] control one of the favorite things that
[21:21] children are tell people grown-ups now I
[21:24] can remember the time when I was a boy
[21:26] and I'm I'm going to get into it folks
[21:28] but I was boy I remember the time you
[21:29] just couldn't say anything you wanted to
[21:31] to a grown person some I say grown but
[21:34] if they're 2 three years older than you
[21:36] and there your babysitter that's Mama
[21:39] and Daddy's
[21:40] word you just couldn't say anything
[21:43] because even in that day they had the
[21:45] privilege or they had the power rather
[21:47] to whoop you you got a whooping from
[21:50] them and you got a whooping from your
[21:52] mama and your
[21:53] daddy nowadays people are so insane when
[21:57] the babysit or whoever is trying to
[21:59] correct that child mom and daddy said
[22:02] don't you touch my child unless you want
[22:04] to touch
[22:06] me they will fight you why they're
[22:13] insane y'all looking at me like I'm is
[22:15] it all right I'm I'm trying to tell you
[22:19] amen that this insanity if you're not
[22:22] careful will anoint
[22:27] you h
[22:29] it anoint you it it it's it's a l to
[22:31] Sheen
[22:33] Spirit it is a spirit that that that
[22:36] becomes dor you know what do insane
[22:39] people
[22:43] do just in the same Pace in the same
[22:47] Circle in the same motion they just
[22:49] don't know what to do they're out of
[22:53] control now I know a girl a friend of
[22:56] ours and my wife we know this uh uh a
[22:59] young lady she used to be a beautiful
[23:01] woman and when we was in the apostolic
[23:03] church and she basically cursed the
[23:05] bishop
[23:06] out guess what happened to her a month
[23:09] or two later totally
[23:11] insane lost all of her beauty she was so
[23:15] insane amen that she literally tried to
[23:18] cut the baby that she was carrying out
[23:20] of
[23:21] her H I don't care if he
[23:24] saw you cannot be
[23:27] foolish to touch sa's
[23:31] garment and we told her I was going to
[23:35] call her name we told her I said it for
[23:37] sure you shouldn't have never said that
[23:39] she thought it was something good she
[23:41] said I said first of all you have no
[23:43] right to rebuke an
[23:47] elder come on somebody amen the word of
[23:50] God is
[23:52] effective right and to this day I don't
[23:54] know where she's at but Lord the way she
[23:57] the demon trans formed and you know what
[23:59] she told me she said I could hear the
[24:02] demon tell me what to do I had to do
[24:04] what he told me to do there was no way I
[24:06] could stop it even though it was causing
[24:08] me
[24:11] pain hello y'all better listen to me
[24:14] y'all better listen to this God ain't
[24:16] bringing this for
[24:19] nothing amen because that's what's on
[24:21] the rampid that's what's happening
[24:23] people are falling away why because
[24:25] they're giving over to the spirit of
[24:27] insanity they don't want to hear sound
[24:30] Doctrine because a sound mind goes with
[24:33] a sound Doctrine and a sound Doctrine
[24:35] goes with a sound
[24:37] mind sound
[24:40] stable right
[24:42] disciplined and people don't want to be
[24:44] disciplined anymore you can preach the
[24:47] word of God on things that'll make them
[24:49] discipline or discipline them in their
[24:51] lives and they walk out thinking that
[24:53] you pointing their fingers at you at
[24:54] them yes it's God pointing his finger
[24:57] not
[24:59] cuz I can't afford to point fingers I'm
[25:01] saved by the grace of God
[25:06] too I'm coming to something in just a
[25:09] moment amen so you say well what do you
[25:11] mean brother Brooks let us turn to First
[25:13] Timothy
[25:15] please 1
[25:22] 8-10 I want you to understand amen when
[25:24] we talk about how we ought to dress and
[25:27] how we ought to behave ourselves people
[25:29] look oh yeah that all that ain't
[25:31] necessary you ain't got to do all of
[25:34] that that's what the devil told
[25:37] Eve that's the same thing he was the

[1:05:34] lord Jesus you were
[1:05:35] insane it's true if you aren't you soon
[1:05:38] will
[1:05:41] be Judas was insane when when the devil
[1:05:45] entered into
[1:05:46] him say you betray him you go to the
[1:05:50] high priest and tell on him what that
[1:05:53] was
[1:05:54] just the there was this insane demon and
[1:05:57] where did the Insane Demon drive him to
[1:06:03] Suicide come on somebody let me go on
[1:06:06] and let me say this en closing you said
[1:06:08] well brother you know people can't be
[1:06:10] like that in church yes sir here was
[1:06:13] Saul the king of
[1:06:16] Israel and what did Saul do he was
[1:06:19] disobedient to God's
[1:06:21] word the prophet Samuel told him you
[1:06:24] wait till I get back
[1:06:26] here now Saul done already messed up cuz
[1:06:29] he he did he took the best of the goods
[1:06:31] and God told him to kill everything even
[1:06:34] the king kill it all right like God told
[1:06:37] us kill all the inhabitants of the land
[1:06:41] lust Pride whatever falls under those
[1:06:44] three things kill it all if you don't
[1:06:47] kill it all it will kill you and that's
[1:06:50] what Saul did he said listen I I'd say
[1:06:53] the best you know how sometime people
[1:06:55] think that character something God got
[1:06:56] to
[1:06:58] use you see what I'm saying in other
[1:07:00] words they might like me for instance
[1:07:02] people say I can sing now if I don't die
[1:07:05] to
[1:07:06] that when I come to God I must die to
[1:07:09] the fact that I think that I can
[1:07:13] sing right cuz that's an inhabitant
[1:07:16] that's something amen that if I'm not
[1:07:18] careful of I'll think that that's
[1:07:20] something that that God God needs or you
[1:07:24] know if I offer this up to the Lord
[1:07:26] he said kill
[1:07:30] everything and that's true if I was
[1:07:32] holding on to singing and music and all
[1:07:34] that stuff I wouldn't be
[1:07:36] here but I had to die out to all of that
[1:07:40] oh come on somebody why because I want
[1:07:42] to be obedient what makes more sense
[1:07:45] than anything else is to stand on the
[1:07:47] word of God there's a lot of singers and
[1:07:50] dancers and shouters and all that in
[1:07:53] hell but you got to come to God in you
[1:07:55] got to empty everything out and say I'm
[1:07:58] a worthless good for nothing
[1:08:00] nobody and nothing I got to can offer
[1:08:03] good to you I'm a sinner right that's
[1:08:07] how you got to break yourself all the
[1:08:08] way down before God can take you
[1:08:13] up so anyhow amen
[1:08:17] Saul Save the King Samuel come and says
[1:08:21] you've done the will of God he says yes
[1:08:22] and that's how a lot of people think
[1:08:23] well yeah I've done everything just like
[1:08:25] I told somebody I said when you
[1:08:27] surrender 100% to God you'll get the
[1:08:28] Holy
[1:08:30] Ghost yeah you'll get the Holy Ghost if
[1:08:32] you surrender all to God you'll get it
[1:08:36] right so I told him I said listen I said
[1:08:39] you know you find out here Saul says
[1:08:41] listen I've done all and then Samuel
[1:08:43] said well what what what what is that I
[1:08:45] hear them in come on all that squeaking
[1:08:48] and
[1:08:49] squealing come on I hear all those
[1:08:52] sounds and all you got to do is listen
[1:08:53] to a person just hold on conversation
[1:08:56] with them and you'll know whether they
[1:08:58] holding on to a few things sir that they
[1:09:00] shouldn't be holding on to Hallelujah
[1:09:03] you say you've done the will of God but
[1:09:05] what is this noise I hear in the
[1:09:07] background and let me tell you something
[1:09:09] if you don't kill the king he's going to
[1:09:12] raise up another Army against
[1:09:14] you you got to kill the king and who is
[1:09:18] that your
[1:09:19] husband before you marry Jesus am Satan
[1:09:23] must die in your life he must become
[1:09:28] dead cuz if he don't become dead if you
[1:09:31] still like a few things that he puts out
[1:09:33] to you you're flirting with him and all
[1:09:34] that kind of stuff he ain't dead yet and
[1:09:37] Samuel saying I'm hearing the
[1:09:39] noise right and so what happened amen
[1:09:43] because of his Disobedience amen God

[1:12:26] 16 beginning at the 14th verse but the
[1:12:30] spirit of the Lord departed from Saul
[1:12:33] and an evil spirit from the Lord
[1:12:35] troubled
[1:12:37] him the Holy Spirit departed from

[1:13:07] all First 1st Samuel
[1:13:12] 18:10 and it came to pass on the marrow
[1:13:15] that the evil spirit from God Came Upon
[1:13:17] Saul and he prophesied in the midst of
[1:13:20] the of the House of uh in the in the
[1:13:22] midst of the house now he he was under
[1:13:24] uh evil spirit and he's yet prophesied
[1:13:28] right and David played with his hand as
[1:13:31] other times and there was a javelin in
[1:13:33] Saul's hand what was Saul going to do
[1:13:36] with that Javelin that's when you know
