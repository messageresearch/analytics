TRANSCRIPT
========================================
throwing in the alliance then no more cowards amen death had no victory over there the Dynamics was in the mechanics yes sir he quickened their mortal body says that now listen here is another thing so quick and them in such a way till you know what there was lifted up in Heavenly places and their mortal bodies were so quick until their language changed he quickened their language that's what the Bible says their language was quick that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you and silly [Music] oh Hallelujah it will Quicken your mortal body it will make you do things you didn't you didn't do before there was full of quickening power then easy in your lives foreign [Music] amen because the prophet I believe in the message that one of the message of the Holy Ghost he says that in order for you to have the holy spirit amen you have to know what is the holy spirit why was he why is the Holy Spirit giveness and what the holy spirit will do when it comes in you amen the prophet says that it's the pillar of fire amen that was divided in different portions amen Jesus was made flesh Jesus Amen in the beginning was in the beginning was the word you know in order for God in order for God to create okay amen he had to condense himself to a form in a form that we call the logos amen and the prophet says that that love God is the same it's the pillar of fire it's a pillar of fire amen God created started to create with that form amen so you wanted to redeem us amen you wanted to become one of us so he couldn't die as a dude he said that this same one who was known as Jesus after the flesh went back to the pillar of Fire but he promised he will come again and dwell among his people by the spirit um and on the day of Pentecost that pill of fire came down and it separated itself in tongues of fire upon each one of them is it what was God doing amen he was separating himself into the church giving all those men and women a part of himself he divided himself amongst he divided himself amongst his church just as he said he was am I giving you and me a part of himself amen so that he can live inside of us so that we can never be comfortless we can always have the comforters will lead us in our truth tell us what to do you mean you will always tell us how to walk amen the prophet says here the prophet to do this in the questions and answers uh number two paragraph 107. [Music] so I said it says now he's comparing the pillow fire to the logos he says now that Pillar of Fire is the logos that went out of God the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God Amen so if that logos is inside of you amen you have the attribute of the fullness of God Amen when God become into into a form to where it could be seen on a former it was the anointing of of the great spirit that went forth It's condescending coming down God the Father the logos that was up over Israel he was holy bear sin there had to be a blood offering right in Eden amen become flesh Among Us and where these logos dwelt in the human body which was the sacrifice when man was made in the image of God and then God came down in the image of men to redeem of the creation of the creator foreign same attributes Jesus Christ was able to create showing us that he also always you always have that that same attributes amen the prophecy that has come down different portions amen and dwells now inside of us amen having the same attributes he only remembers even having the same power that means that if if something is going wrong that spirit that is in you women is able to speak the word and the situation will change amen he needed he needed a a created a squirrel he stopped the snow and by the Tempest amen him and he gave a life to a little fish give love to that little boy who had an accident his body was all over the place amen that same quickening Powers it was the same thing with the disciples amen with the disciples foreign [Music] you'll be able able to speak the words and bring people back to life again because of that same Spirit if that spirit is jeans from the Dead images thousand people received the holy spirit amen 3 000 people were added to that first number and they went on they started speaking the words and we have the same word amen because Malachi said he meant that he will bring the the hearts of the children to the father bringing it back it may bring it back to that Pentacles let me bring it back to that first church because we have the fullness of the words we have received the fullness of the world the thing that Paul was longing foreign foreign man is the logos that created everything through logos the Bible says I think in Revelation chapter four because he said that he created everything for his pleasure it's exactly that was leading the children of Israel when danger were coming the Bible says that that pillow fire left from being before them and went in there it meant to protect them he meant to become their Shields don't be afraid that pillow fire will protect you know what David said even though I walk in the valley of darkness amen I wish I shall not fear because I know that God will always be with me because I know that God is inside of me so I will not fear Elijah amen and then he was he was raptured it was translated received the double portion of the same spirituality was one bird with two Wings amen representing the type of of of the sins that are alive in the sense that are asleep Elijah was translated [Music] Elijah was translated Transfiguration foreign [Music] [Music] he said that this is a dying spirit in a dying body um but now you can be in two bodies at the same time at one time but there can be two Natures in in you at one time now the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you're born again you're not born of of physical like a baby was like the baby was baby but what happened the spiritual Birth has come to you make this past and while the spiritual birth is growing into your heart into your heart amen there is a physical or a Celestial body growing to receive that Spirit yeah while this spiritual birth is growing into your heart there is also a physical body there's just a Celestial body amen that's growing receive their spirit amen he continues he said that and when the life leaves this body it is when the baby when the body is presented to the Earth the spirit comes in this is you know when the baby is inside of the womb that's gonna be big amen he doesn't have the breath of life yet the prophet says that it's only muscles that's a stretching the prophet is a song Amen but when that baby amen comes out the spirit will automatically come in so it's the same thing with us just Justice when the body is presented to the Earth it it comes the spirit comes in this is and when the spirit goes out of the body for we know that after this Earthly Tabernacle with the soul we have one already waiting I mean it's already there that's it that's the spiritual body of the People sisters amen the prophet says that it's already there and he says that that's where you get your power from it is not charging a battery even when you feel weak yeah you get the power from their body that's already there man it's waiting foreign is the earnest of that change that's coming see look look guys um you are dead for you you not yourself you reckon Yourself Dead waiting for waiting for the sea germs it is in you no more isn't it it's not the man it's God in the man message amen it's the seed germaster like the beginning spoken word it's God's word made manifest in the manifested it isn't the man it's a man that's died it can be a hybrid in the sun it is amen he has either to be a son of of death or a son of life so if he's the son of death I give it over to God oh give it over to God and let him kill the devil that's in you run him out amen then let God plant his own life in you I'll only see you plant this is then it's not you no more it's God's life because it's God's worded by the Holy Spirit we produce the same thing it will produce God Amen God's worded by the holy spirit amen he will always produce God himself that raised up Jesus from the dead that raised across from the dead they are also Quicken your motorbikes in you um look at it with with Adam amen was because of him the evil safe amen look at Abraham if I look at Sarah sorry Sarah I mean it was because of Abraham so he gave you that same promise you shall live also amen you are saved because of him and the prophet says that the God never said no God never did God never separated the bride from The Grooming amen it's all in one even when you went on the cross I was there with him amen when he created the world I was there in here amen I was redeemed in him he was made the word amen now he has given me the same word I have become the walk in the pistol [Music] um so now the question is is your life worthy for the gospel amen are you walking with him amen what's your relationship with him do you talk to him as often as you can see um does he talk back to you amen because it's a relationship meaning that you talk and he talks back you may look at Moses amen he was one of the greatest prophets amen nobody like him personally when he was able to talk to God face to face talking to God and God talking back it's a fellowship relationships and let him talk back to you but he can only
