TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he took bread and blessed them and break them and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and have appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking a bread one more scripture let's go to Isaiah 40 please read the tenth verse their tenth and eleventh verse of that particular chapter Isaiah 40 behold the Lord God will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he should gather the Lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom they shall gently lead those that are with young let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you we thank you for such a great day that you have given to us we thank you for being so real and father without you we are nothing you have been out all in all and we realized in all things everything we're together for the good of them that love God we thank your Lord for being real to us Lord we thank you for everything bless the service that's the heart of these young men who come up to hear your tonight I pray that you would speak a word a word of encouragement to the young men as well as to us those of us who are remain bless us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray in Jesus name Amen you may be seated as I was thinking and by God's grace and like I said I trust that the Lord will bless you tonight I think I was thinking about how sometimes we we really don't see how perfect his salvation is how sometimes we struggle because we don't have a definite I would I say a a vindication or the kind of vindication we want from God to define who we really are but I know one thing that that in this day and age the only reason why you're here tonight is because God brought you here and even to our young brothers who have come all the way from Iowa City don't come in vain because God brought you here God's Way it's so simple sometimes we fail to see his in his leadership have you ever gone by somebody's house and they were so glad to see you and they thought oh I just prayed that the Lord would send somebody by my house or I just prayed that God will have somebody called me or something like that and all of those things don't seem to be simple it's really in the hands of God or in the plan of God every jot every tittle every hair on your head is already numbered he as we were saying not long ago you know in this scientific world we find that they're in their science they're always trying to offer man a long life to live well if you take this pill or if you do this or do that you'll live longer but that's nonsense that's really contrary to the world you can be healthy and die you can be kind of on a sickly side and still live because our days are numbered from the time of our birth to the time we leave out of here those days are exact God doesn't erase any any time and we find out that every time God is ready to do something is it's perfect it's not according to man's clock it's according to God's clock a lot of times you you we look at these things and hit my my my subject tonight is by His plan it's not about you it's what makes God happy it's where God gets the glory he gets the glory out of us and regardless of how we may look it may look like it's not going just right God is the great Shepherd he knows how to lead us and one thing I know about sheep and I'm not just gonna preach on sheep and sheep trusts their Shepherd wherever the Shepherd goes to sheep will follow and they won't hear another voice they have in tuned their selves to his voice only if we could be sheep like that that could only tune our voice into his voice into us where that we would only hear him but the thing that I was thinking about was that how many times it it's in an inner in a way of a story God would tell us and he come by says well Mary was at the well and an angel showed up and it wasn't like Mary came to the well and the angel decided to show up but God ordained those actions to take place even though Mary wasn't aware that she was going to meet an angel that day but in God's mind he had already laid that plan out he knew what Mary was going to say every word that Mary uttered God had already seen it even though Mary didn't know the next verse or the next line in her conversation God knew every jot and every to know God knew when she says God how can this thing be when I've never known a man see that's God I love the open he he'll bring men to their own intelligence so they could ask questions so he can answer them and then Mary said to herself you know however this thing be Lord let it be according to thy word it was God's plan that day to meet Mary you understand what I'm saying when you got saved you just didn't get saved because all of a sudden you thirst for God you thirst for God because God gave you the thirst and at that appointed time he had already he could have given you he could have given you the Holy Ghost or he could have saved you at the moment you thirst but God allowed for the thirst to increase because there's a certain measure of thirst you must have before God can answer see sometimes you say oh I'm thirsty well not really because you can go on another hour to or however but when you're really thirsty or thirsting for something it's painful it's got I got to have it it's if it can become almost what we call it insane craving I gotta have it I would actually kill for it you understand me those kind of thirst and when a thirst in you overcome it is God none of us get thirst after God except God gives you the thirst the scripture says no man can come to God except God draws him when when it came to our a Jacob Jacob though he was a sight you don't it makes you wonder why God Lord why didn't you just go ahead on and give it to Jacob why didn't not Jacob come first but God showed you that even in the wound there's a battle and there's a battle with Jacob and Esau right there in the womb showing that even in your in your field you'll create it is creating you or bringing you in a place of a fall you were gonna always have about them from the womb to the grave amen I guess you you because here you had Esau and Jacob and you gotta you got you got in your in your right now by God's grace you have the old man and the new man Paul say kill the old man every they kill him right because you got to realize Amen that only one can live they can't both live at the same time only one can live but God planned it that way see because he want to see want you to see how much he cares and of course you got to understand you and I could never love heaven and love God except we come this way not in the way God wants us to love you right because love has been has never demonstrated it's not sound well how I know you love me well what did you do for me what way did you express to me that you love me right so understand by God's grace that love is not just words flowing out of your mouth oh I love you it is an expression and in that expression is a life in that life is God's life that life is a surrendering life that life is not a pride for life that life will give up everything to make you live right God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son but when I was thinking about that I thought about how I preached just last week on dimensional things see because we don't realize that God is watching right now he is the all-seeing eye he sees everything he hears our thoughts you kick you can't get no one that could be as great as years and when I say that I mean he cares in the sense that he knows every move you're going to make huh think about the scripture in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us now think about this now how much God hate sin and sin his unbelief God hates it he hates the attributes of it and yet his love for you and I was so powerful that's why I say we need a server before Thanksgiving right because you and I must understand that God is not playing with your salvation maybe brother Brooks will make it maybe he won't you know I'm hoping he will know your salvation is solid is sound right yeah if God is giving you eternal life he cannot take it back it's sound it was so sound he wrote it in a book is that right I'm jumping almost but I'm saying all of these things because when we read the story and we find Amen that here was after the resurrection how Jesus purposely found those disciples now he didn't have to call nine-one-one I look up on some kind of diction area or since I'm kind of radar out excuse me he knew exactly where they were but my wonderful thing the wonderful thing the work the thing I love about God is that he could have automatically opened their eyes but you know a lot of times the Lord allows you to hear your heart God knows what's in your heart but sometimes he allows circumstances that come in your heart in your life so that you can utter whether what you believe or whether you disbelieve you bring yourself in his presence sometimes your anointing just come and you don't even know it's there on auntie you understand me and all of it all of a sudden you said oh god father forgive me I you know I didn't mean to do that and you know all of a sudden you know conviction comes on you when it should have been there all along but it comes on you at a time when you think you forgot know you failure to say you know mean do the job that you're supposed to do and then God God y'all know what I'm trying to say things that you should have gotten right or should get right all of a sudden God brings it back to your mind oh you know Lord I'm so sorry you know what and you're in most of the time we don't even recognize or realize that God is the one that brought it up now you could say Lord I ain't apologizing to that sister because she needs to apologize to me now you're talking to yourself who you're talking to oh I'm talking to you myself no you're not God is engaged you in a conversation and you're talking back to God in that way and you don't even know it you're not talking to yourself you talking to somebody see because he's done it you know and sometimes those waves those vibrations hit you in a certain way and then you began to talk thinking that you're talking to yourself and you're not hmm think about it how they will you know on their way to Emmaus and they said they've broken it hard and then they ask God where have you been you don't know if what has happened in Jerusalem and he lets him go on with that foolish talking and then he began to expound the word to them right here is all your gone to hell only legalism somebody say something say something to me the other day there's two types of hearts there's a stony heart and there's a heart of flesh legalism when it's the wrong wrong way of being legal is engraved in stone grace is in the heart of flesh because when you find a man that's so legal that he's actually condemning everything and everybody he doesn't even realize because of his the condition of his heart he's already condemned and that's the way God could have condemned them but he didn't he this is old foolish and hard you know have you not believed all that the scriptures have said but you see what do you mean that was a lesson they learned now after the resurrection he's still teaching them who he is and he's still giving them time to repent time to clean up hallelujah ha because they got him way they gotta meet him sometime on the day of pentecost why he does it that way is all this pleasure it's for his own good will why do God allows us ain't meant to get sick sometimes I thank God you said what do you mean and all things give things and I think God because even in this little call through whatever you want to call it and then what it has been the Bible says God healed him and as they walk on their way it manifested sometimes we just have to have faith that we are healed and as we walk it manifests itself it may instantly go but the you know is going to go because God's Word says with the stripes we heal is God's pleasure sometimes the only way he can get a real good sincere prayer out of us is to afflict us sometime now I'm looking at everybody so I don't think I'm throwing off I'm just trying to tell you that you and I are not in a position where God is not mindful of every condition in every state you're going through I was thinking about some of the young people there and I was sitting praying the other day that not only God gives them a green card but give them the citizenship they want you know I was thinking about that because I was talking to somebody about it and I said Lord I said I just prayed that you do that the devil says well you know according to trump we don't worry about Trump they say Trump's playing when God does something he does it all and he does it right you understand me no the Bible tells us that in all things he says listen we are more than conquerors through him that loved us can you be persuaded tonight I know that sound really simple but it's God's plan how in the world I got to Iowa from South Carolina I always marvel at that cuz I hate women I hate the cold God didn't say had to love it no he didn't I respect it because has a plan every season has a plan it's a reason for every season so I have to respect it but I marvel at how God has such as far as I'm concerned he has such a sense of humor and I'm telling you now if it wasn't for me and some others the winters up here would probably be more fierce than with it cuz I know God answered my prayer many times and others but I always says Lord I'm not trying to take away from what you're trying to do whatever you need to do with your weather do it not my will but thine be done right so we look at these things and you said well I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things come what may Paul what made him able to say that what was it because he's on the pilla fire or was it you know because he he had a UH a great aptitude and a mind where he could study and remember the Scriptures no he met Christ and he knew that the Christ that was in the pillar of fire that spoke to him that day was no longer only outside but inside he understood that he had a seal that could not be broken that the promises of God are yay they could not be broken Paul says nothing can separate me whatever I go through and I'm telling you Paul went through some suffering let me tell you something when you find a person that gets some hardship in their lives and they go back into the world they never loved him they never met him like Paul Manning because every time Satan tries to accuse my god hey I find no father if anybody ought to be suffering it's me I'm the sinner God is and look at his mercies towards me how can I find fault in a God that loves me the way I am how can you with God who keeps you alive who feeds you and and gives you strength keep you healthy look around you there's so many people who don't have and yet in his plan he planned for you to be healthy hallelujah and you know what he guarantees you your health by placing you into the gospel because he knew that if I can get a people in the gospel no matter what kind of disease might try to strike him they will overcome because they know my word and they believe my word that's in his plan his plan amen is here for us to live a prosperous and healthy life it doesn't mean that you're not tempted and try your sons and that's what God is looking for real sons and daughters of God that's gonna stand on his word regardless to what Paul said I am persuaded that means nothing can convince me otherwise I am persuaded no matter what or height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from all the devil the devil can not separate you once that union is there is there eternally hmm lead you about says he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he gather the less with its arms and carry them in his bosom and I love that about God because sometimes we stumble sometimes we fall sometimes we get weak and I tell you what you know what he does he doesn't kick you he carries you and every one of us can say here tonight that God has carried us at some point in time more than once times when we thought we couldn't go any further when the tests and trials were so overwhelming you said Oh God but then there's always a word of comfort think it not strange when you fall in to die temptation knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold and knowing that God is working something out in you and you don't even know what it is but at the end of the day you're still bow down and says he's Lord and king of all think about it and this is what if we could get in them but people's mind how often times people wonder will I make it well in reality I've had that question and I've had God to answer for me right off the tape but my thought is is this is this will I make it we ask that question will I make it it is I've already made it I've already made it you understand it's not will I make it you've already made it when you pass from death unto life you've already made it but we think we look at our frailties and our little fleshly little things in and think oh my god this could hinder Paul says nothing can separate nothing can separate me oh you said what what do you mean it was God's plan for Saul to mess up God knew that Saul was gonna mess up as a king before Saul was even a king Sam you knew this man being a man he's gonna mess up and saw was the people's choice and because he was the people's choice God knew he's gonna mess up but give him a king anyway right but did God kicked Saul out of his economy because he messed up he even even ripped Samuels that was worthy of death I'm excuse me you know yeah a garment and you and you think to yourself you said all presidents what's going on but God says all you rip the the garment of Samuel and the kingdom is ripped from you but was he lost absolutely not and we think that God is so I don't know emotional like a man well you know if you don't treat me right I'm gonna send you to hell there's a lot of people who didn't treat God right and didn't go to hell so I didn't do right David didn't do right every man has done God wrong some way or another and yet he saves us anyway because it's his plan to save you your names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation or this is why the people who said we believe this message ought to be the happiest people in the world rejoicing always should always be with us he said what brother was what you saying let me say God has steps that he carries us he could have he could have given the disciples all come follow me boom you got the Holy Ghost he could have given them that in the beginning but he worked with them for three and a half years if I could say like that and they did not have nothing but the Holy Ghost on their flesh that old nature was still living in them and can you imagine a God as holy as Jesus you don't say here disciples you trying to teach in the right way I know it I know somewhat a little bit how you trying to teach your children the right way and the next thing you know they fussing and fighting and Carol and a brother just takes me the other day he takes me the other day he said brother Brooks do you think my children's ears were put on backwards when we were teaching him the truth he said you think when they get older they get wiser and he just left it to him I said old brother don't worry I know exactly what you're going through because you know I'm sure God you know he says not to talk this boy haven't told him how many time and you know what you and I ought to be so thankful that God blood covers iniquity not just seeing iniquity and Nikoli is when you know to do good and you still don't do it right the Holy Ghost will warn you and say something and you'll Fletcher take you anyway see that's you've never experienced that before oh yeah but that's what Paul says you got you gotta kill it if you don't pray and keep that thing on the submission you think that old man is gonna be holy in making that only about this beast and he's gonna get you every time you neglect to pray and keep consecrated he's got a trick for you that's the old man that's the serpent I gotta see it right on the brother was talking about that the other day and I said that's where the real shame comes in when you know to do good and you don't do it oh yeah oh yeah you're right but what what secures us is that he's predestinated us he's Podesta nated us to be sons and daughters of God children of God of children with the Jesus Christ himself what according to it what good will and pleasure it's God's pleasure he said what oh the devil might knock you down for a few rounds amen but you know we always win the battle you know every day we win the battle every day because all you have to say is Father forgive me Lord cleanse me Lord feel me and you're right back where you started you don't need the devil don't like it but we got advantage of him we got an advantage over him and that is the blood of Jesus that's our advantage that no matter what sin we do and what unbelief we have in us at time God's blood still justifies us hey Roman process and brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh we should die but if he through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live now if there is it any debt we have a debt toward the whole period we have a situation where we need to let live live the life is what I'm saying we all God could I say like that we hold him our lives and we ought to will it willfully give him our lives but the Bible says it like this for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God right for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to feel like it overcome you've already overcome you like that little crow a man Johnny crow Johnny crow why are you why don't you come I just can't because I've been going around the circle and God has already cut the card you gotta go you gotta yes go free you got to realize a man that the blood of Jesus Christ Calvary has got every cord of bondage every chord that's his plan that was a blood plan right Redemption by blood Redemption by power see once you can Slade that's the plan but now God wants to see the power of the blood in your life that's his plan that's his plan is that right listen prophet of God said in proof of his resurrection in the Providence of God's great eternal plan of salvation how that in time past when God made man to be a worshiper he loved himself he made him that way that he could he would have a desire to worship and all down through the ages man has loaned to look at a past the captain that hain't between him and where he is going he began to quote the king of England st. Augustine in 80 603 he said when King of England was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by st. Augustine sitting at a great fireplace one night while he was talking to him about Christ a little sparrow flew in the into the light and fluttered around a little bit and flew out and st. Augustine said to the king he said where did he come from and where did he go - he said that's the way that every man that comes into this world he comes in here walks in a conscience of senses not knowing exactly where he comes from and there's only one book that can tell him where he's going - and that's the pipe on and by that the King was converted and gave his life to the Lord and the next morning he and all of his household was baptized in the name of the Lord see is she once a man see you don't have to slaughter man with Scripture give him something that he could see a reality something that he can just see that there is a God see cuz everybody know everybody want to know where they going and where they came from thank God for this message it's not that God comes along and do things that but but God's Word being God His Word is always tested God allow tests to come upon his own word that's what makes him God because he knows whatever he says it cannot come back void it will accomplish no matter what the adversary does or would do to try to stop the Word of God for being fulfilled excuse me it will come to pass not one word that one word can fail how God did that between the Old Testament and New Testament he spanned his plan of salvation he hosted up the ensign of God God was healed none other than the son of God to join man ant and to God man and to God it was a time tested he tested it through the seed of Abraham Oh down through Isaac Jacob Joseph down through David on down to the end until the perfect seed come that would stand in the middle and hold sinners or one in and God on the other and bridge the way and see that's why people think they can make heaven without Jesus but Jesus Christ is the bridge he is the one that will you know what God ordained that was his plan right and you and I when we realize that's why I don't understand Trinity how they want to put three guards in in this in this equation because God is such a just God he could not have sent somebody else to die for us he had to come himself and when God came himself he became the British he said find that find that in the Old Testament when Adam and Eve fell who became the bridge Jesus himself the voice walking in the cool of the Endon he was the one that brought the skins he was one that brought the blood in him hallelujah he was there at the beginning he's there being there's no way around is so perfectly plain but what did Adam and Eve them do they you see what I'm saying what did Adam and Eve do for God to do what he did when God has said sedated you surely you eat of this thing you should surely die what was it I tell you what it was nothing they do nothing do you don't see it in the scriptures when they were crying out for God Oh God it was God's plan you didn't look for God God look for you when you started looking for God it was when God put something in your heart to look for it we love the world I don't ain't nobody out that can say they didn't love it as long as it was going good you loved it but God was one this God making it go bad you didn't know that he was turning it up everything uncomfortable Amen so then he could put you put a cry in your heart for him God did that interrupted your life your wonderful life God did it he did to me he started to everybody and we reason this is the greatest enemy this mind you got to get rid of it I'm telling you you can't process God here God is only known in the heart he's only known in the heart when you think that you can outsmart God a little little little imp you know what I mean you know being sassy we God raising up his fists and you know God I got that you don't even have to put much pressure to it you know that much my thing is I just don't understand how men who can't even control their breathing can think that they got control of their lives it makes no sense to me you don't control that God controls it and I don't care if you say Oh breath don't leave me when God says that's your last one that's your last one don't make no difference I rich you how how famous you are you know I mean let's see how much control me and half of their lives now when death comes right every piece of God is right everything that's written in this Bible I believe willing to lay down my life for it I may not have faith enough to make every promise come to truth but I'll never stand in somebody else's way who does have faith to do it if I can't walk where Enoch walked with me and went home without dying I wouldn't stand in somebody else's way who could walk that way with God that's right it's dying tested and I believe that every word of God is pure and unadulterated so he what is he saying time is testing you time is testing you are you gonna continue to walk with God you walk with Him step by step like Enoch did it doesn't mean you don't make my space but walking with God makes you perfect huh yes this salvation is perfect and you think Oh God Lord am I going to get the Holy Ghost if I gonna get it the Bible says if you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that ain't no ifs ands abide now God determines when he wants to give it to you and none of us can make it we can't make it happen but one thing I know if you ever get desperate enough you get it but where does the desperation come from absolutely make me desperate you see like I was telling her brother the other day I'll not be satisfied until I see all of Christ in me the fullness of my measure you understand me the fullness of my measure the measure that he has in me and when I how would you know because once that happens you will experience a complete satisfied satisfied satisfied satisfaction a complete satisfaction you said what were you doing brother boots you hate how they talk or whatever could see I know I'm healed and the devil and his line vanities is trying to say I'm not don't be scared of me for other brothers or sisters this is just lying bandit easy there's no sisters out there but anyway I look at these things and I said Lord I know what your word says not by power not by mind but by my spirit I want my brother's to know I get I'm encouraged I get really encouraged when when young people stirred up for the Lord that encourages me I love that I got saved when I was young and I'm telling you the fire has been burning ever since and I was one of those ones got out there on that corner and paid played my tambourine and saying and witness the people back I'm all kinds of times of the day at night I even had a key to the church so I can take him up there baptized I don't even know where they are this city but it was narrating my business God's business the people in my school said you know that Brooks guy he done went crazy they were so right but it wasn't me it was God and my thing is when I see young people like our brother Frank in different ones and a really stirred up about the Lord I just really get excited because I know what could be time with such talent now here we are who gonna instruct God who's gonna say to God who gonna say to the Lord you know Lord you know why didn't you make me this thus and the other let me read something to you brother Branham had nothing to do with who he was God did that and I'm gonna read something to you to prove my point you had nothing why aren't you dead why aren't we did you know here God brings me from all the way from Lyme and then brings you all from south from Africa and what why are you here what is there's a purpose behind this now it ain't just to save your natural life there's a purpose it wasn't here to to save my natural life there's a purpose you let's put it this way when God had Joseph and Mary to go there to Bethlehem it looked like they were going there just for the taxes but there was a child to be born in that city right so there's got to be some spiritual thing that God wants to do here for you that he couldn't do that see and you got to realize you got to search for it you got to look for it now Lord you brought us here and whatever the purpose is show me see that's why I'm here I'm not here to be in just about a pastor in Ohio I didn't come here just to be a pastor I was that before I came here there's a purpose and I don't care the group gets there's something that God is trying to show you stop looking at your earring ways that is not it it's the commission that God is trying to give us you can always be faulty in some way until God stops that until he comes and bring you to the perfection that he wants you to be in you're gonna still struggle until then but we don't stop fighting we don't stop struggling because we realize God is doing something in the inward man there's a plan and that plan is being fulfilled in every one of our lives no matter what it looks like you think brother Branham wanted to be what he was he didn't want that he didn't even want to be a preacher but that was God's choosing just like it's been God's choosing for us the morning of listen says listen I'm talking I'm a sovereign grace because I can tell you there have been several times I should be dead and yet I'm not I wasn't even a Christian when I was seed and that was what God protected see the morning up there in the mountain when they opened up the cabin door little old door it was a window it was a little door juh you push out and didn't have any glass in it push it out a light a light about so big around come rolling in and went down over the bed where mother was holding me in her arms that aren't adulterated that without unmerited grace that was God seeing nothing you can do or nothing I can do he says that's God's plan he gave me toe Jeremiah I chose you I elected you I did this you we didn't do nothing it was spiritual it was small if we're if we've got a gift of discernment you didn't do it God gave us that that's his plan and his plan is that if we have certain gifts all of these gifts is for his glory I wouldn't let brother Branham get out of it we really visit him they don't whatever you do don't don't don't mess around with women don't don't drink no wine and stuff like that and don't don't smoke he said there were times I wanted to do it you don't know that he wanted to do it he was dentist and all of a sudden that thing goes nothing can do what nothing can do nothing you could I can do that's God's plan it's got to be just what he says see he's determined if you notice gifts and calling is without repentance he said you believe that Jesus Christ was a woman see from the Garden of Eden that was promised you believe that it was show that sees your bruise the serpent I always think God is a God I said if I'm the least in heaven I still thank you because you didn't make me a Judas I'm glad to be who I I think are for every trial every test you know we can look back in our lives and we can see things in our life that we may have gotten into and wish we would not have but let me tell you something God didn't make a mistake in that while we were yet sinners he saw that he could have stopped every time every time you did sin he could have stopped it like he did brother branham he could have done it you and I just as important but you know why he wants to make something out of that in that great Judgment Day when people stand there and says Lord I just couldn't overcome you said come on over here brother what did I work what tell us tells us your testimony however lord I was in labor seeing I just could do hey I've got a group of people up here who come through later see I can tell you they overcame here they see yeah so no man will have an excuse you're not just sitting here doorman like without a purpose your presence will judge just your presence when you'll stand with Christ see he couldn't eat he listened Moses he couldn't help because he he was Moses he was both Moses is that right John the Baptist seven hundred and twelve years before he was born he was the voice of the one crying in the wilderness but I say the Prophet is that right Jeremiah God told Jeremiah said before he was born I knew you sanctified you and ordained you be a prophet over the nation before you even come from your mother's womb and Jeremih as far as I was concerned he had one of the toughest jobs a prophet ever had yeah he an easy kill I don't know those people are so hard hard and so backslidden reprobated and everything else and I can you imagine every altar call he called nobody couldn't even get a tear from their eyes it was so hard and listen let me tell you something the devil can so get to a person where they become so delusional until they think that what they're doing is right and that's exactly what happened to Israel they mess around with the more advice and all these other kind of ice and all of a sudden now then traditionally doing exactly what they're doing and don't even know they're wrong it took it Elijah just bring a separation from the right and the wrong in Israel right because you know Bailey's Lord and here there was his Oh Lord you said that can't be happening it's happening now people calling Lord under the inspiration of Trinity and they think that's Jesus Christ and it's not go don't look bad at me cuz I was there but it took a word to make me know that there's a God of Elijah and there's a god called that's under disguise of Trinity read study or histories it's there you know you got the Arabic God have mercy you know people don't mean to be ignorant but without a vision the people perish if God doesn't bring a prophet if he didn't bring a prophet we would all be in darkness right now because it's God's plan to bring a prophet to bring the word according to Amos that's the only way we can get it and you know like people don't understand you know I might not worship the Prophet but I show thank God oh my god I do honor him cuz I realized what he went through see right now we see things we see what's happening we can look in the audience and call it out right well brother Adam saw like I tell people I said don't y'all know when brother Branham was preaching the message as he was preaching everybody looked like Christians most of the women 90% of the women world war dresses most of them in my day didn't wear makeup most of them still was really women feminists you know right now oh you better know what you better get you a church girl that you know you've seen her grow up in church because out there you don't know what that what you're covering with your package you know it's the truth hey let me move on by God's grace because I don't have much longer but I'm saying you could not help you were born just the way God wanted you to be you think why why did God choose Thomas and he knew Thomas had problems with faith because he knew that was awake some Christians would but it did not exclude them he knew that some Christians was a hand on thing sometimes they got to feel it sometime they got to touch it but once he met the real God you never hear of Thomas ever doubt the game but he was a Christian and to that point everybody have their stages to walk through right I mean you can Sosa's same rain comes the same sunshine and all of them don't sprout at the same time wonder what that is cuz God didn't ordain for all on the prowl and so so is it with Christians all those blah blah 'some and gloom at the same time we just don't do it he's a god of variety you're like that now let me let me hurry up I'm a closing just a minute yeah I just got one more quote but when we see by God's grace and this is what I want to say to us before I forget Thanksgiving should be something we do every day and all things give things sometimes we just forget even in your trials and you test when you can hold your integrity and says I know God is working it out for me I may not be able to see it but thank you Jesus you know I'm gonna tell you something praise they take you a long way with God a lot of times people don't realize that grumbling and mumbling more you get into more trouble but when you begin to praise God for the harmful things that seem to be coming upon you thank you Jesus thank you for that thank you for this thing for that he knows what you and he'll get you come out of that thing and you see that your enemy has become your footstool yeah that's the way God works you he love praise he loved most of all when we trust him and I love the way that scripture says trust in the Lord with all your heart see that's what he wants he want for trust from us in him no matter which way he leads us and that was one of the things that that Joshua and Caleb could do no matter how bad it looked and how many people fell before them they kept trusting the god of Moses all right listen prophet God says like this and I'm leaving this would be a last one there's a big dark shadow setting yonder before us called death and every time our hearts beat we move one step closer to that one of these days it's going to take its last beat and we're going in I want to be at that at my time make my lot as I hope every one of you is tonight when I know that is it's laying just before me and I have to meet it I don't want to be a coward I want to be wrapped I want to wrap myself in the robe of his righteousness walking into it knowing this that I am sure that I know him in the power of his resurrection that's right see not just my power by blood powered by powerful powered by resurrect you need the rest that's what Paul says I don't want to just know him in the suffering I want to know him in the power of his resurrection that means when I die I wouldn't come right gonna be wrapped myself in the role of this righteous walking to it knowing this that I am sure that I know him in the power of his resurrection that's right that when he calls from among the dead I'll be called out with them that's a living God is a God of the living now as they journey in this land we found out that God made a plan for them he brought Redemption by the blood then we find out he brings Redemption again by power he we found right before last night before last that he had the blood applied which was very beautiful type of the believer that when he has accepted the death of Christ in his instead that he becomes a child of God he starts on his journey that don't you know a lot of Christians haven't done that they have not accepted Christ as they stayed that's why they still struggle struggle with em I say will I be saved because if you accept Christ in your place it's already paid that's sure that's assurance there you know what I'm saying it's assurance there you accept the as your savior he took your place so you you he died for you so you cannot die that's it so you say okay when you do that that that's an assurance but there's a lot of people in in this message who haven't even done that and they fall and they struggle in a you know in and out all kinds of stuff but it's because they have not accepted Christ as they say because when you do that you'd pass from death unto life I was telling a brother your dad said don't you know that's why the foolish virgins made it they weren't dead they were alive they it they were redemption by blood they gave their lives to Christ Redemption by power because they were able to be sanctified but they didn't go by the redemption of the Resurrection they needed a resurrection in them they needed the Holy Ghost in them to get them up but they go through the spirit I don't know how God works it out all I know is that the foolish virgins appear at the white throne judgment with the goats and it's God who has to separate them think about it because really brother answer like this you either receive the mark of the beast or the mark of God see so they didn't receive the mark of the beast because they had the blood of the Lamb not in his full measure and that's the problem a lot of people don't have it in the full measure but God cannot say you're gonna die when he said you've already passed from definitely life so god that's an honor his word they come up and they get eternal life but that's a white throne judgment see and people don't want to believe this but I said it like this you know if it's the same material made out of the same material means the same message people in this message you're not going all the way you understand me they won't be they know what he says divine nature they know that when brother Brown preached the statue of a perfect man they know we got to get there but nobody's working with it ah because we've had brothers come and they tried to make it works you got oh you know what I'm saying y'all know what I'm saying they made the statue of Christ works it's not works it's God building you not you building yourself he is the carpenter no man can add one cubit to a statue but when we see that the brick is not laid right we know how to pray God add to me and when you ask God for that expect trials is that right when when Israel was rebuilding the world they were in battle they had a scalpel or whatever one went hand and a sword in the other same manner that everybody was trying to stop him from building the wall so when you're in a build when you building God building you you're gonna go through a lot of trials you gonna go through tests but it's it's worth it all but that's God's playing and that's the only way we'll make her righteous by that plane I've been in the message sturdiest and what did you do with it when God is trying to build a house in you and we're so busy building Isles and building innocent bill at least David said Lord I've done all these things and the Lord is without a house even it's not that Scripture the Bible said the Fosters alcohol and birds have nests but the Son of man have no place to lay his head I preached that years ago I preached it years ago and a brother called me only brother you're wrong the gap stone has come down I said I'm not doubting that but where is it what lives do you see it he wants somewhere he can lay his head he wants to have headship over us as individuals the operation is here is already here it's in the atmosphere but God wants somebody who's willing to allow him to build his house right David was so worried about building God a house God says no I'm going to prepare a place for you that's where I am there you might be me all so is this okay now let me just closes out now God made manifest that he had given them life through the death of the Lamb now he's going to show them physical Redemption hallelujah see both of salvation and healing see for the natural man in the spiritual man that their angel passed over proving that God had made a way of escape through the offering of the blood and they accepted it now it is going to make our way of escape from the physical death like the believer also as soon as he gets say maybe a cancer excuse me has eaten him up or some disease God has redemption also through power the same answer me as he has redemption up for the Soul he has redemption for the body so see all the blood of Jesus Christ is to cover three parts of you your body soul and spirit the whole land is supposed to be saved and you know and I know we know that this this soul has been saying in the spirit amen god gives us a new spirit to put our whole egos in that spirit right redemptions for that to par but the last part God does it himself God gives you new body ah the new bodies waiting for you it's not that you know God ain't making heart making you now he's already made you hallelujah she is God's plan so we ought to say thank you Jesus my prayers this Lord I told somebody the other day I says I don't have no doubt in my heart I'm saying I've been saved a long time really in my knowledge you know what I mean I've been saying when I gave my heart to the Lord and everything I was saved right then and there God proved it all the way through but that ain't any what I'm pressing for I've been called according to the voice of Matthew 25 Malachi 4 we've been called to a rapture we are the elect lady the special class of people right we hear it all the time don't get frustrated in a sense when you feel like well Lord I don't have the Holy Ghost like I want it you got it like God wants you to have and at that time when God get ready to change you he's gonna change you if your faith is steady because without faith it's impossible to please God right Abraham can hold on to his promises for how long huh oh there he held on to it no priest 127 years all right cuz God said he was going to rain he knew his job went over till it rain you know and you look at ourselves and we said we Abraham see I don't care if I'm in my last moment of living on this earth all of a sudden God packed me with the seal good enough Karina you know because it's not up to me when he was because there still thinks he might want me to do when I said this number y'all might not like this but there are things that God knows that down the road I might not hit this hit it just right but that that not hit it right might affects something else everything we do affects something whether it's positive or negative it's going to affect something right I mean you got to realize and then that even Simon when Simon wouldn't even watch Jesus feet say hello to him and nothing like that did you know that was still orchestrated by God and when God came to Simon house it wasn't just to see Simon he knew that every who's coming he said right there in a place where she could see him from where she was she knew he knew the horse he knew it that day he was going to be a knowledge it because he is such a lady I don't know you ought to know what kind of woman that is I mean you know and everything and he claimed himself to be a prophet now he's hearing everything they're saying you know some of us we could I don't know what we do we had such a discernment like that I don't know do you know brother Balaam had it that way sometimes he's preaching here so now you know you can't hide nothing from me now God can you imagine the forces that was coming his way but you know what the point I'm trying to say is this a lot of times we think even our erring ways yeah but even so God allowed things it doesn't mean that I'm telling you to go do something wrong but you know what when Ruth and her husband and sons went down to Moab you'd think God would say oh no don't you do that down there no there is some inside inspiration came from somewhere and they went down there why why did God send them down there had them to suffer don't get me wrong when you are doing wrong you're gonna suffer for it but at the same time God would be glorified in it he will always be glorified in it because he went down there and Ruth and all them and then they did Naomi they only picks up Ruth right but Ruth was always a seed how in low air a seed like Ruth who according to history said she was a priestess how she was gonna get to Israel this God went there for her God went down there as a secret agent that's why I said because even though naomi was down there and her son Marimo abideth stay taught Naomi the word I mean they over taught roof the word high - for her yo God gonna be my god your people and somewhere she saw some supernatural it was more she had to see more in them that she saw in Moab so God worked it all out it's like when God took Pharaoh and put him in I mean Moses and Pharaoh sisters house like a chaotic situation but God knew this season he was gonna make it bloom and I'm just saying right now young people I don't know what you're going through elders of the church all of us we're going through something everybody's going through something some worse than others but don't give up on God he'll never give up on you and all things I believe that Scripture all things work together for the good I have been in so many tight situations in my life and God has always come through every time every time and if you can trust him like that he'll be faithful like that that's Dan will always oh it was great that my liberty [Music] No [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I and so he looked beyond my fault and saw my knees amen what a glorious day what a glorious time I'm trusting that everybody's excited let's say just to throw this out at you we know brother madam says that that stock market is going to crash one day we see how the world is basically turning their backs on America because of certain things supposedly that happens this year and the years now now what would we do there's only one hiding place he said brother Brennan said easy living will be over for the Christian ding hey here to put us on our knees Dan moment and and to be honest I think to myself if something like that doesn't happen soon as the scripture says if God doesn't shorten the days no flesh would be saying God got to put us in a prayer mode some of us are there but there are many of us that are not there and we need we need a reconnection with God amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all harsh minds are clear anybody design prayer let's just pray father we thank you for the service Lord we thank you for everything you have done for words cannot express our gratitude thank you for my life health and strength we're grateful and all or for all that you do for us Lord forgive us father when we don't praise you enough or give thanks enough but consecrate us Lord make us more concentrators help help us to be more concentrated we want to walk in every every every statue step by step Lord we want to give you glory in our lives Lord be that trophy lord help us now bless each and every one of us as we go to our different destinies I pray father that you tomorrow er should come that you give us a wonderful Thanksgiving a time of things a real Christian holiday where we can glorify you bringing us through the storms and the trials and tests of the year you have been so faithful to us Lord you're forever faithful grant us victory Lord that we will be forever faithful until you bless us now keep us in your care in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] [Music]
