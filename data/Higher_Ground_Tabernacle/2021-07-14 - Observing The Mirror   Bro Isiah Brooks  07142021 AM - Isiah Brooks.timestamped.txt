[23:20] so
[23:25] so several of you know probably here in
[23:28] the room but some of you may not
[23:30] a number of years ago my grandmother was
[23:33] driving down the road
[23:35] and she had never heard the word
[23:37] theophany never
[23:38] she know anything about it didn't know
[23:41] what it was had never heard of it nobody
[23:43] was preaching about
[23:44] theophany at that time so she pulled
[23:47] over to the side of the road and she
[23:48] wrote these words in this psalm book
[23:51] and grandma has been gone
[23:55] this coming may will be 20 years she was
[23:57] called home but she did
[23:58] exactly what god wanted her to do and
[24:00] she has
[24:02] shared several songs but this one
[24:04] particular song was traveled around the
[24:05] world
[24:06] i've heard it in several different
[24:07] languages several different ways
[24:09] and i am by no means her but uh
[24:12] i promised her when she was getting
[24:14] ready to cross over that i would keep
[24:16] sharing her songs
[24:18] and i know brother brooks does a
[24:20] wonderful rendition of this
[24:21] but i wanted to share it with you i
[24:23] tried to look for other songs
[24:25] and it passed by my way in three
[24:26] different places in a song book so i
[24:28] said this is what we'll do
[24:35] one day
[24:47] [Music]
[25:09] [Music]
[25:12] so
[25:21] [Music]

[32:46] we we encountered an honor and a
[32:49] privilege to
[32:50] have our sister angela senor here um
[32:54] and her friend sandra we had a lovely uh
[32:58] supper or dinner yesterday and i had not
[33:02] laughed so hard in my life it was
[33:04] medicine to my bones i'm telling you it
[33:07] was
[33:08] and we enjoyed every moment
[33:11] of it and on top of that the shrimp and
[33:14] the onion rings was
[33:16] number one yeah so god was good to us
[33:20] and i appreciate her stopping in to see
[33:23] her she comes occasionally
[33:24] [Laughter]
[33:26] since angela goes way back her uh when
[33:29] those
[33:30] my children were little children and she
[33:32] would take them and give us a little
[33:34] break at times when we were in west
[33:36] virginia
[33:37] and we thank god it uh uh during that
[33:40] time we would
[33:41] go to uh brother charlie spencer's place
[33:45] and
[33:45] all and she would meet us there and we
[33:47] would have a good time and
[33:49] i guess yesterday i found out why she
[33:51] was taking the kids because
[33:53] they would stuff us all in one room and
[33:54] she was giving us
[33:55] [Laughter]
[33:58] and it was true it was true so god was
[34:01] good to
[34:01] us and you know her her her grandma's
[34:05] sister
[34:05] craighead uh was a wonderful lady and
[34:10] and like i told sister angela nobody can
[34:12] sing my theophany
[34:14] like she could and she'll hit a note
[34:17] and she would spin like that it was all
[34:20] over then
[34:21] [Laughter]
[34:24] but yeah when i first heard i sing that
[34:26] song i'm like
[34:27] yes that's mine
[34:29] [Laughter]
[34:30] i will be singing that song and i guess
[34:32] i sung it so long and so much people
[34:34] thought i wrote it
[34:36] but i would always correct them by god's
[34:38] grace no it was
[34:40] sister craighead that uh we came to know
[34:43] as a wonderful sister
[34:45] in the lord and um she's been going for
[34:48] a while but her presence is
[34:50] always with us and her memories uh so we
[34:53] thank god for
[34:54] her and we thank god for sister sandra
[34:57] coming and
[34:58] the saddest part about sister sandra is
[35:00] that she doesn't sing
[35:02] [Laughter]
[35:06] otherwise you know would have her give
[35:08] us a selection as well
[35:11] um give me the key of c um
[35:20] [Music]
[35:22] may i have your attention
[35:28] i like to introduce
[35:56] is

[36:38] is
[36:52] is
[36:58] [Music]
[37:06] arena
[37:33] i will never count him out
[38:02] is

[38:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[38:39] i am so grateful that he is my champion
[38:45] i could not have done this myself
[38:48] i needed him and i will always
[38:52] need him throughout eternity i need him
[38:57] and i will always
[38:59] [Music]
[39:01] stand in honor of the word
[39:06] normally as a first song i can't do it
[39:11] god did that and i thank god for
[39:14] giving us the grace
[39:18] we ask that you turn with us to
[39:21] ii corinthians we appreciate the
[39:23] musicians always the song leaders
[39:27] there's a time we didn't have much but
[39:29] you know god has blessed us
[39:32] and uh you know we're grateful
[39:35] we're grateful for everything
[39:39] you know it's it's amazing
[39:42] i find god amazing i know we shouldn't
[39:45] look at him in all because he
[39:47] is what he is but when i think about
[39:51] the transformation and the changes that
[39:53] he's made in my life
[39:56] i give god all the glory i could not
[39:59] have done it
[40:00] i have no change in me except the
[40:02] changer
[40:04] and i thank god for the grace of god
[40:07] amen second corinthians 3
[40:10] we're going to read from on the 17th
[40:13] verse
[40:18] a thought came to my mind today i had
[40:20] been listening to
[40:21] other things and various thoughts that
[40:24] uh
[40:25] that just got my mind and
[40:28] caught my mind and my attention
[40:31] you know we've been working on you know
[40:34] uh the changing into the image of god
[40:37] you know the basically the capstone and
[40:39] what god has been doing in this last day
[40:41] what makes our message different from
[40:44] laodicea's message
[40:46] and uh the reason why we follow malachi
[40:49] for our teachings and you know why we
[40:53] stand
[40:54] the way we stand enzo doing it has made
[40:57] us
[40:58] an oddball we're different from all
[41:01] others
[41:02] and people don't understand why but the
[41:05] reason being
[41:06] is because god has made the difference
[41:08] uh to be chosen and elected by god to be
[41:11] bright is the greatest honor
[41:13] uh one could ever have in this life
[41:16] and i i believe that i am chosen i
[41:19] believe that i have been elected
[41:21] uh for uh the
[41:24] the great celebration amen and i believe
[41:29] that
[41:29] at this day and time the bride is making
[41:32] herself ready
[41:34] second corinthians 3 beginning at the
[41:36] 17th verse
[41:37] now the lord is that spirit and where
[41:41] the spirit of the lord
[41:42] is there is liberty
[41:46] but we all with open face
[41:49] beholding as in a glass
[41:52] the glory of the lord
[41:57] are changed into the same image
[42:02] from glory to glory
[42:05] even as by the spirit
[42:08] of the lord let us pray
[42:13] father god what can we say
[42:18] all of the praise and all of the glory
[42:21] that we could ever
[42:22] allow to come out of our lips
[42:25] will never be enough
[42:28] to express who you really are and what
[42:32] you deserve
[42:34] i've had and heard a songwriter said if
[42:38] i had ten thousand tongues i would
[42:40] praise you with everyone
[42:42] but even with that saying it still will
[42:46] not be enough
[42:48] father there is no way to express our
[42:50] appreciation
[42:53] to you other than to live this life
[42:57] and father that's what we're asking you
[42:58] tonight
[43:00] in our praise and our worship we're
[43:03] asking you to live
[43:05] live in us live through us that your
[43:08] glory may be seen
[43:09] through and by us and so we surrender
[43:13] the service into your hands
[43:15] we say oh god have thine own way in
[43:18] jesus christ's name we pray
[43:20] amen you may be seated
[43:26] i was thinking today
[43:30] how the people so many people
[43:33] you know just hate the bible
[43:37] especially in this age of liber you know
[43:40] of the liberals
[43:46] yeah i saw on the news the other day how
[43:48] they're burning down churches in
[43:50] canada and nothing's really being
[43:54] done you know canada is like a twin
[43:57] sister to america
[44:00] you know basically what goes on there is
[44:02] coming here
[44:04] we know the end of what this thing is
[44:06] going to turn into
[44:08] the persecution of the true bride of
[44:10] jesus christ
[44:12] but we do know that at that time is when
[44:15] we when our lover shall appear
[44:17] amen and he's going to change these old
[44:20] bodies from mortal
[44:21] immortality
[44:25] i had a thought
[44:30] and the thought is observing
[44:33] the mirror or the reflection
[44:37] in the mirror and when we talk about a
[44:41] reflection it's
[44:43] it's a throwing back by a body or
[44:47] surface of light
[44:50] heat or sound without absorbing it
[44:55] everybody loves the mirror almost
[44:57] everybody loves the mirror
[44:59] you want a kind of mirror that's going
[45:01] to show the real reflection of you
[45:04] some mirrors will enhance your looks
[45:09] and some will do just the opposite
[45:12] but we like the kind that's going to
[45:14] really
[45:15] give us a little enhancement
[45:19] and oftentimes those mirrors will do
[45:21] that
[45:23] you know by way of the light that's
[45:25] striking it
[45:28] and uh but we look and every day i'm
[45:32] sure every one of us look in the mirror
[45:34] i hope so anyway
[45:38] because by looking in the mirror you
[45:40] checking everything out to make sure
[45:42] that everything is in order
[45:44] and you're the one that's going to
[45:46] approve the image in the mirror
[45:50] you're the one that's going to judge
[45:51] what you're seeing
[45:54] and sometimes when i'm looking in the
[45:55] mirror i says lord have mercy
[46:01] sometimes even to myself
[46:04] i look rough
[46:07] but i'm talking tonight about the mirror
[46:10] of the word
[46:13] this word of god is not something that's
[46:16] just placed in a book
[46:18] matter of fact this is not all of him
[46:22] because the scripture says that if
[46:24] everything written
[46:26] of him was written we would not been
[46:30] able to contain the books
[46:34] and that was written yesterday
[46:38] what about the things that uh god is
[46:40] doing today
[46:43] things that people don't even know about
[46:47] yet and still god is fulfilling his word
[46:50] god has never failed us and he never
[46:53] will
[46:55] this message or this bible in itself
[47:00] is an emancipator
[47:04] it will set and make you free
[47:07] amen you and i sometimes we don't
[47:12] understand why we need to read the bible
[47:15] because we the bible says the truth
[47:19] will make you free
[47:23] those of us i mean i'm sure all of us
[47:26] have been in bondage
[47:27] in some way or another
[47:30] psychology couldn't do it mind over
[47:33] matter
[47:34] couldn't do it mama couldn't do it and
[47:36] daddy couldn't do it
[47:38] many times they tried to drive those
[47:40] demons and devils out of our lives
[47:42] and they couldn't do it you understand
[47:44] me
[47:45] but the only thing that can and will do
[47:48] it is this
[47:50] jesus said if any man come unto me i
[47:53] will in no wise cast him out
[47:56] i believe that with all of my heart
[47:59] before we came to christ we were all
[48:01] slaves people are afraid of that word
[48:05] but it's true
[48:06] we were all slaves to sin you know what
[48:10] the master would tell us to do is what
[48:12] we did
[48:13] there was no argument there was nothing
[48:17] in us to refuse what he wanted to be
[48:19] done
[48:20] we didn't have god but we had him
[48:25] and you must understand that this guy
[48:27] who had us in slavery
[48:29] must die amen he must die
[48:33] in your life because there is a law
[48:37] that you cannot marry jesus
[48:40] having another husband
[48:43] and that's exactly what the devil was
[48:46] to us before we became christians he was
[48:50] our husband
[48:51] he was our master he was our ruler he
[48:54] was our slave master
[48:57] we worked for him
[49:01] we're talking about making a rapture
[49:05] and we understand by god's grace it is
[49:08] the grace of god
[49:11] but songs of solomon said and that this
[49:14] this bride of jesus christ will be a
[49:15] mature bride
[49:18] there will be no flaws in her now i want
[49:21] you to think about it
[49:23] because even now without the blood of
[49:25] jesus
[49:27] we can see flaws
[49:30] but understand the blood has come to
[49:33] excuse me perfect you
[49:37] the life of the blood rather we call it
[49:40] the holy ghost but what is the holy
[49:41] ghost if it doesn't bring a change in
[49:43] your
[49:44] life the holy ghost is life
[49:47] it is god even though the world might
[49:50] want to see it
[49:51] as a second person or a third person it
[49:54] is
[49:54] the person it is the spirit
[49:58] that that the logos came out from
[50:01] is that right because jesus said i go
[50:04] come from my father and i go back to my
[50:06] father
[50:06] and when he came back on the day of
[50:08] pentecost he was
[50:10] the pillar of fire amen so you and i
[50:13] must understand by god's grace
[50:15] amen that there is nothing that can
[50:17] change you outside the holy ghost
[50:21] and the holy ghost is the word in the
[50:24] beginning was the word the word was with
[50:26] god and the word was god
[50:28] amen and it still is amen
[50:32] so you and i must understand that we're
[50:35] the spirit of the lord and we
[50:37] i'm gonna kind of interchange this
[50:39] because the spirit in the words insane
[50:41] we're not talking about you know the
[50:44] rhema
[50:45] we're talking about the logos
[50:48] we're talking about that word that lives
[50:51] we're not talking about the written part
[50:53] of it
[50:54] this bible can be burned but you could
[50:57] never burn god
[50:59] you could never destroy god because god
[51:02] is a spirit
[51:03] y'all understand me so what i'm trying
[51:05] to say is when you've got the holy ghost
[51:08] the holy ghost will change you
[51:13] you don't change yourself it changes you
[51:17] hallelujah it's amazing how so many
[51:20] people
[51:20] with the holy ghost constantly trying to
[51:22] change himself
[51:25] you know what we are kings
[51:28] [Music]
[51:31] you know what the king has to do stretch
[51:33] himself like a cross
[51:36] and he's got everybody around him who's
[51:38] dressing him
[51:40] putting on his shirt put y'all
[51:42] understand me
[51:44] a king doesn't even label to dress
[51:45] himself
[51:48] he has those who are ordained
[51:51] to address him oh that's good i feel
[51:54] like shouting john right now
[51:56] because you and i must understand amen
[51:58] that when we
[51:59] under we come in contact with god it is
[52:02] god who
[52:03] does he does the work
[52:07] he worketh he has the only
[52:10] laboring we do as christian is to enter
[52:13] into his rest
[52:15] according to hebrew but we work so hard
[52:20] and most of the time we're in his way
[52:25] this is grace and this is not law this
[52:27] is grace
[52:29] and you can't mix the two the devil will
[52:32] call you a hypocrite because you love
[52:34] grace
[52:35] let him call you dad if he wants to
[52:38] because i'm sure he's called you
[52:40] worse things than that
[52:43] but you must understand amen under
[52:46] through his eyes it looks hypocritical
[52:50] but in the through the eyes of god he
[52:52] says i find no fault
[52:55] y'all understand me we've already been
[52:58] examined
[52:59] is that right when they took jesus amen
[53:02] from
[53:02] judgment hall to judgment hall what were
[53:04] they doing
[53:05] examining his body they were examining
[53:09] him to make sure
[53:11] to see if he had any faults but you see
[53:14] they could find no fault
[53:16] y'all understand me and you and i we are
[53:19] the body of christ even then they
[53:22] couldn't find no fault
[53:24] the bible says who shall lay any charge
[53:26] to god's elect
[53:28] it is god who justify it
[53:36] and the thing about it is we work so
[53:39] hard
[53:41] and that's the problem if we would pray
[53:44] like we ought to
[53:45] it would bring us to a rest it will stop
[53:49] us from
[53:49] laboring in places we we don't need to
[53:52] labor
[53:54] israel got in trouble with god because
[53:56] they did not
[53:57] know how to honor the day of rest
[54:01] understand me and we don't have a day of
[54:04] rest
[54:05] jesus christ the holy ghost is our
[54:08] sabbath
[54:09] he is our rest and when you get the holy
[54:12] ghost
[54:12] you're supposed to rest from all of your
[54:15] labor
[54:17] when you rest from your labor you're
[54:19] happy
[54:23] i can tell you that yesterday those
[54:25] shrimps were the best shrimps i had in
[54:27] the
[54:27] perhaps ever i'm not a shrimp lover but
[54:30] i love those i enjoyed those
[54:33] now i'm saying that why because i was
[54:35] laying back i was resting
[54:41] and it was a good rest so let me move on
[54:43] by god's grace
[54:45] so you and i unders must understand
[54:48] we're not
[54:49] you know when we were born into this
[54:51] world we came by way of the tree
[54:54] of god good and evil because remember
[54:58] in the beginning it was just a good tree
[55:00] that was adam and eve there were good
[55:02] trees
[55:03] there was a another tree the knowledge
[55:05] of good and evil
[55:06] that was a bad tree and in that mixing
[55:10] we became good and evil that's what god
[55:13] said
[55:14] now they have become like gods they have
[55:16] become like us they
[55:17] know good from evil
[55:21] [Music]
[55:22] and ever since we came into this world
[55:24] we've been fighting
[55:26] even with ourselves good and
[55:30] evil right paul says listen even when i
[55:34] tried to do good when i wanted to
[55:36] do good evil was always there
[55:41] right oh it's true even when you're
[55:43] doing good to
[55:44] others evil is always there
[55:48] trying to influence you
[55:51] hallelujah but here in the word of god
[55:54] there is a solution to it
[55:57] and by god's grace i trust that god
[55:59] would give us
[56:01] the spirit of utterance in matthew 7 8
[56:04] through 18 through 19 says
[56:06] a good tree cannot bring forth good
[56:10] fruit
[56:11] excuse me evil fruit neither can a
[56:15] corrupt tree
[56:16] bring forth i got it mixed up right
[56:19] a good tree cannot bring forth corrupt
[56:22] fruit
[56:23] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[56:25] good fruit
[56:27] every tree that bringeth not
[56:30] forth good fruit is you down
[56:34] and cast into the fire
[56:37] y'all understand me so we're not in the
[56:40] age of good and evil
[56:42] amen
[56:46] right from death unto life
[56:49] and he became the tree of death because
[56:53] by every birth a woman comes from
[56:55] amen you're going to die that's it
[57:02] but there was one tree he said if you
[57:05] eat of me
[57:07] you will never die you'll live forever
[57:11] hallelujah
[57:12] now i want you to understand though this
[57:15] flesh might lay down
[57:16] brother bruce could never die
[57:19] don't cry over me like i'm dead you know
[57:22] sir
[57:23] done died already
[57:27] anyway let's move on amen matthew 12 33
[57:30] says
[57:31] neither make the tree good excuse me
[57:34] either make the tree good
[57:36] and his fruit good or else make the tree
[57:39] corrupt
[57:40] and his fruit corrupt for the tree
[57:43] is known of his fruit now that's where
[57:46] i'm at
[57:47] when you look in the mirror what are the
[57:50] fruits
[57:51] what are you looking at when you look
[57:53] into the word of god it will define you
[57:56] it will separate you hallelujah
[58:00] you understand me it will allow you to
[58:02] see
[58:03] who you are what you are amen
[58:07] hallelujah it is that's the word
[58:11] without the preaching of the word you'll
[58:13] never know you're a sinner
[58:16] it's the preaching of the word it's the
[58:19] word that brings light to us
[58:23] is that all right people used to say
[58:27] years ago oh i thank the lord
[58:31] for delivering me a from a miserable
[58:34] life of sin
[58:36] but my life never became miserable until
[58:39] the word came into my life
[58:45] amen you'll still enjoy sin
[58:48] when that's all he knows but once the
[58:52] word comes in the light comes in
[58:54] and it brings a little conviction then
[58:57] and only then you could never be the
[58:59] same
[59:00] right amen it changes you when you know
[59:03] truth because the truth will make you
[59:05] free
[59:08] hallelujah saint john 8 31 says and ye
[59:11] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[59:13] make you free not set make you free
[59:17] right and what is truth that's the truth
[59:21] what is truth jesus says i'm truth
[59:25] i'm the truth and i'm the way i am the
[59:28] light
[59:29] is that right amen is that right amen
[59:33] you know brother branham said it like
[59:35] this he said a good he said
[59:37] a true mount transfiguration
[59:40] experience doesn't glorify moses
[59:43] doesn't glorify elijah it only glorified
[59:46] jesus christ himself that's the only one
[59:51] and though we all work together like i
[59:53] was saying the other day
[59:55] i said yesterday we was at the table
[59:58] and god was using us amen
[1:00:02] you say oh lord when you know one day
[1:00:04] god gonna use me god using you now
[1:00:07] amen it's just that simple god is using
[1:00:11] you
[1:00:11] now we're looking for these you know
[1:00:15] dividing of the waters
[1:00:18] turning water into wine raising the dead
[1:00:21] what about the woman who brought forth
[1:00:23] her few pennies
[1:00:26] what about the woman a man who who had
[1:00:28] no physician that could heal her
[1:00:29] and she went and touched the hem of his
[1:00:32] garment
[1:00:33] hallelujah y'all understand me simple
[1:00:36] things
[1:00:37] even mary who who didn't know that god
[1:00:41] was using her
[1:00:42] when she said uh would you do something
[1:00:45] about this at this wedding
[1:00:47] we need some wine and all we've got is
[1:00:49] water
[1:00:50] hallelujah you see that that wasn't
[1:00:53] chance
[1:00:55] that was ordained by god because that
[1:00:58] was supposed to be the first miracle
[1:01:01] and god worked it just that way y'all
[1:01:04] understand me
[1:01:06] see what we fail to do is when we love
[1:01:08] on our brothers and love on our sisters
[1:01:10] and
[1:01:11] help our brothers and help our sisters
[1:01:13] you are in the word
[1:01:15] and god is using you because the bible
[1:01:18] says they will
[1:01:19] know you that you are my disciples by
[1:01:22] the love that you have one for another.
[1:01:25] but we fail to see those light those
[1:01:27] things that people think
[1:01:29] is not you know people like to to blow
[1:01:32] their horns
[1:01:34] oh brother so and so did this for me and
[1:01:36] he laid his hand and
[1:01:37] i got healed no no no no no no
[1:01:43] no you know what heals you your faith
[1:01:46] and you know what that faith in itself
[1:01:48] give is a gift from god look it up
[1:01:50] that's what brother brahma said
[1:01:51] he said your faith god gives you the
[1:01:55] gift of faith
[1:01:56] because that man can pray for you all
[1:01:58] day until god gives you the gift of
[1:02:00] faith
[1:02:01] ain't nothing happening that's right
[1:02:05] hallelujah i like that
[1:02:08] you know so you look at this thing he
[1:02:11] says
[1:02:12] how be it this is the part i like
[1:02:16] because we're coming we're coming and
[1:02:18] how we know we're in truth because
[1:02:20] god said it would be this way that's
[1:02:22] right amen
[1:02:24] how be it when he the spirit of truth
[1:02:28] is come he will guide you
[1:02:32] into all truth i got this from
[1:02:35] uh sister angela yesterday she said he's
[1:02:37] a god
[1:02:39] i'm like yes he's a god he's a guy he's
[1:02:41] not gonna make you do nothing
[1:02:43] he's gonna lead you he's a shepherd
[1:02:47] he's not going to force himself on you
[1:02:49] you're going to either do it or you
[1:02:51] won't
[1:02:53] whosoever will
[1:02:57] that was good guide you into all
[1:03:00] truth guides you god will place truth in
[1:03:05] front of you
[1:03:06] you must still make the choosing you
[1:03:09] must
[1:03:09] you must choose for he shall not speak
[1:03:14] of himself
[1:03:16] but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:03:20] that shall he speak and be
[1:03:24] he will show you things to come
[1:03:27] can i read the amplified version is this
[1:03:30] all right
[1:03:32] but when he the spirit of truth
[1:03:35] the truth giving spirit comes
[1:03:39] he will guide you into all truth
[1:03:43] the whole full truth for he
[1:03:46] will not speak of his own message
[1:03:50] on his own authority but he will
[1:03:54] tell whatever he hears from the father
[1:03:57] he will give the message that has been
[1:04:00] given to him
[1:04:01] and he will announce and declare
[1:04:05] to you the things that are to come amen
[1:04:08] that will happen in the future
[1:04:12] amen and you can slide malachi 4 right
[1:04:15] in there
[1:04:17] you understand me because he said he
[1:04:21] not they
[1:04:24] so he prophesied jesus is telling
[1:04:26] there's coming one
[1:04:27] like like moses said there's coming one
[1:04:30] like me and jesus said there's coming
[1:04:32] one like me
[1:04:33] and he'll be the son of man a son of man
[1:04:37] revealing the son of man
[1:04:40] and he's going to speak my word we
[1:04:42] needed it
[1:04:43] look at all the confusion we're babylon
[1:04:46] all over again
[1:04:48] everybody's right in their own eyes but
[1:04:51] god said
[1:04:51] there shall be light in the evening time
[1:04:55] hallelujah it didn't stop i'm living
[1:04:58] from glory to glory
[1:05:00] is that right hallelujah all the way
[1:05:03] from ephesus
[1:05:04] up into the bride age or the bride
[1:05:07] dispensation however you want to say it
[1:05:09] but i know one thing i'm living in
[1:05:11] eternity
[1:05:14] hallelujah you say well what do you mean
[1:05:17] well i'm gonna tell you something truth
[1:05:21] it's truth
[1:05:24] but certain truths cannot be applied to
[1:05:27] our day
[1:05:29] it was truth when god told
[1:05:32] noah build an ark for the saving of your
[1:05:36] house
[1:05:37] that was applicable for that time
[1:05:41] but building a nod can't save you
[1:05:45] because god has moved on it was true
[1:05:50] when god said put the blood on the
[1:05:51] doorposts and the little
[1:05:53] try it now there they'll lock you up for
[1:05:55] slaying an animal
[1:05:58] it was true and by that truth because
[1:06:00] they obeyed that truth
[1:06:02] amen they walked free
[1:06:05] hallelujah think about it the pharisees
[1:06:08] and the sadducees in their time
[1:06:10] believed that they were saved and and
[1:06:12] that they were going to heaven
[1:06:14] they they were perfect on the law they
[1:06:17] they jotted every
[1:06:18] ah eye and crossed every teeth
[1:06:24] their works were great so much so paul
[1:06:27] said i was blameless
[1:06:29] in the things in which i was taught
[1:06:32] i kept it all it wasn't just paul the
[1:06:35] rich young ruler
[1:06:37] was tested himself by jesus
[1:06:41] and just went down the line amen with
[1:06:44] him because he asked a question
[1:06:46] by law he says lord what must i do
[1:06:49] and because he approached that was his
[1:06:51] protocol he asked god what must i do
[1:06:54] in reference to the law to keep it and
[1:06:56] jesus went down the line see you've got
[1:06:58] to be careful how you ask
[1:07:00] god questions hallelujah and so what did
[1:07:04] god what did he do he went all the way
[1:07:05] down
[1:07:06] and he said oh but you good you good
[1:07:08] there check check check
[1:07:09] check but he saw one thing
[1:07:12] he loved his money he loved his riches
[1:07:16] right and the probably god said god
[1:07:18] called him the minister
[1:07:20] and he switched that he he he had rather
[1:07:22] be rich
[1:07:23] than to preach the gospel let me tell
[1:07:25] you something
[1:07:26] there there is nothing that can measure
[1:07:31] the wealth that god will give you
[1:07:35] when you become a christian you say my
[1:07:38] brother books you don't look rich
[1:07:39] i am you may not see it
[1:07:43] but my day coming
[1:07:44] [Laughter]
[1:07:47] and the gold and everything that i
[1:07:49] obtained by jesus christ will
[1:07:51] never be kinked amen
[1:07:56] i'm richer than you can imagine but let
[1:08:00] me
[1:08:00] go ahead on he even you know but the
[1:08:02] rich young ruler couldn't give it up
[1:08:04] you see that's what's wrong with people
[1:08:07] you approach god by the law
[1:08:09] he's going to respond to you by the law
[1:08:13] you understand me but look zacchaeus
[1:08:17] even though he was a rich man he saw
[1:08:20] himself
[1:08:20] so unworthy and he tried to hide
[1:08:24] up in the sycamore tree and jesus
[1:08:27] passing by knew the heart of zacchaeus
[1:08:30] said come on down out of that tree
[1:08:32] this day i'm going to have dinner with
[1:08:35] you
[1:08:36] i'm going to stop at your house but look
[1:08:39] at zacchaeus
[1:08:40] he never asked the question but because
[1:08:43] of his heart being right
[1:08:45] he was inspired he began to confess
[1:08:49] he began to say what he had and he began
[1:08:52] to tell god
[1:08:52] i'm going to give this instead of this
[1:08:54] i'm going to give this instead of this
[1:08:55] you see what i'm saying
[1:08:57] that's what the living god will do
[1:09:00] that's what
[1:09:00] inspiration will do what happened if you
[1:09:04] can't read or write
[1:09:05] you need the inspiration of god you need
[1:09:08] god
[1:09:09] you need the life hallelujah
[1:09:12] glory to god you see
[1:09:16] how be it when the spirit of truth has
[1:09:18] come and the spirit of truth
[1:09:20] has come and that's what the world is
[1:09:22] missing
[1:09:23] you say well what do you mean brother
[1:09:24] brooks don't you understand the majority
[1:09:26] of people always miss it
[1:09:28] in the days of noah the majority missed
[1:09:30] it
[1:09:31] in the days of of moses majority missed
[1:09:35] it
[1:09:35] you say oh no no no millions came out
[1:09:38] yeah but they still was blind
[1:09:41] they never understood who moses was
[1:09:44] hallelujah he looked like a man but he
[1:09:46] was god in the man
[1:09:48] y'all understand me that's why they miss
[1:09:52] william branham
[1:09:53] amen it had been even prophesied that
[1:09:56] many would look on him as he was god he
[1:09:58] wasn't
[1:09:59] yet he was you're not yet you are
[1:10:02] amen see it's god in you
[1:10:06] the man never declared himself to be god
[1:10:10] people did that they're caught
[1:10:13] everywhere and their message calls
[1:10:18] the reality of it is true there's
[1:10:20] baptist cause
[1:10:23] methodist cults every
[1:10:27] everybody got look up the definition and
[1:10:30] you'll find it
[1:10:32] right but there are those who are free
[1:10:37] you understand me they understand who
[1:10:40] their husband is they understand who
[1:10:42] their lord is
[1:10:43] they understand and they'll never be
[1:10:45] entangled in bondage to a man
[1:10:48] they have christ the same anointing that
[1:10:52] malachi 4 had
[1:10:53] they had it a double portion is given to
[1:10:57] the bride
[1:10:58] y'all understand me don't get me wrong
[1:11:02] let me break it down so you can
[1:11:03] understand what i'm saying i i say break
[1:11:05] it down i mean
[1:11:06] like that let me just say it this way
[1:11:09] when moses was on the scene everybody
[1:11:12] wanted to see
[1:11:13] moses moses do this moses do that
[1:11:17] and he did when trouble came called on
[1:11:20] moses
[1:11:23] but when moses passed on now moses never
[1:11:25] died
[1:11:26] like that he died but he was resurrected
[1:11:29] right but moses told
[1:11:33] joshua whatever you do remember
[1:11:38] everything moses said you see what i'm
[1:11:42] saying
[1:11:42] so joshua's commission could not go out
[1:11:45] well
[1:11:46] without moses foundation y'all
[1:11:49] understand me
[1:11:50] but what did joshua do that moses didn't
[1:11:53] do
[1:11:54] when they got over joshua began to make
[1:11:59] the church
[1:12:00] work
[1:12:03] he took all the emphasis off himself and
[1:12:05] says no you go spy out the lady
[1:12:09] you understand you go this you go that
[1:12:12] because you need some experiences
[1:12:14] you need the supernatural experience
[1:12:16] i've got it you
[1:12:17] need it and that's the way the pride is
[1:12:20] right now
[1:12:21] you need it the move is on for the bride
[1:12:25] you need it
[1:12:27] hallelujah is pie out the land conquer

[1:14:25] first king let's uh read at the
[1:14:28] ninth verse
[1:14:32] 17 9.
[1:14:37] i think i'm in the right place

[1:14:53] must be 19.
[1:15:00] i'm actually jumping my my mess but
[1:15:03] let's go there let's go there
[1:15:05] first king let's start at the uh we
[1:15:07] could read the ninth verse but i want to
[1:15:09] read the 24th verse 24th verse the last
[1:15:11] verse
[1:15:12] of that particular scripture
[1:15:16] and the woman said to elijah
[1:15:19] now by this i know that thou
[1:15:22] art a man of god and that the word of
[1:15:25] the lord
[1:15:27] in thy mouth is truth
[1:15:36] and the elijah of that day
[1:15:41] that anointing came on the prophet of
[1:15:45] this day
[1:15:46] y'all understand me why are you
[1:15:48] preaching this brother books because
[1:15:50] if you stray away from the books if you
[1:15:53] stray away from the tape
[1:15:54] if you stray away from the urim of
[1:15:56] theorem
[1:16:00] somewhere satan gonna slip a lie on you
[1:16:02] yes sir
[1:16:03] amen and he is the father of lies
[1:16:10] do you think god is stupid
[1:16:14] do you think god will allow this
[1:16:16] generation to go the way it is
[1:16:18] without leaving himself a witness
[1:16:23] god will never leave himself without a
[1:16:25] witness
[1:16:27] he told this wicked generation that even
[1:16:30] the queen of sheba
[1:16:31] is going to rise up in judgment against
[1:16:33] you
[1:16:35] why because she she was willing to lose
[1:16:39] everything for the truth and when she
[1:16:42] saw
[1:16:42] solomon the prophet of god in his on his
[1:16:46] own display
[1:16:47] he said oh my goodness the half has
[1:16:50] not yet been told y'all understand me
[1:16:54] do you really believe that god will let
[1:16:55] the gentile age go in come in and out
[1:16:58] without sinning a prophet with
[1:17:01] everybody out there all it's doing is
[1:17:03] bringing more confusion
[1:17:06] but i'm gonna tell you something god has
[1:17:08] never left himself
[1:17:09] somebody got to be speaking the truth
[1:17:12] and everything that they speak should be
[1:17:13] able to be found in the word of god
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:20] hallelujah now i'm saying this too
[1:17:23] because you ought to understand that
[1:17:27] brother branham was actually ordained to
[1:17:30] clothe the bride
[1:17:32] with the word you understand me
[1:17:37] we saw what what what all the other ones
[1:17:39] are doing
[1:17:41] we see how they've corrupted themselves
[1:17:46] but the bride of jesus christ she's
[1:17:49] clothed with a pure word
[1:17:52] now you say what brother bruce well
[1:17:53] listen i'ma tell you something it's
[1:17:55] god's provided way
[1:17:57] i've had nothing to do with it
[1:18:00] god chose noah could have been another
[1:18:02] of somebody else
[1:18:04] but that was god's providing way god
[1:18:06] chose moses
[1:18:08] could have been yeah and moses was a
[1:18:10] murderer but god chose him
[1:18:13] that was his way god chose paul who was
[1:18:17] saul
[1:18:18] a murderer too he cheered when they
[1:18:21] stole
[1:18:22] stephen but he was the great man of god
[1:18:26] and a lot of people don't even know to
[1:18:28] this day he was the angel of that age
[1:18:31] paul wrote more books than any of them
[1:18:35] and then he had a statement said if you
[1:18:37] don't believe what i believe
[1:18:38] if you don't preach what i've written if
[1:18:40] you don't believe that you're going to
[1:18:41] be cursed
[1:18:44] amen well i don't believe paul well you
[1:18:47] don't have to
[1:18:49] [Laughter]
[1:18:51] i just say the word shall not fall away
[1:18:55] the bible says the grass withers and the
[1:18:57] flowers fade away but the word of the
[1:18:58] lord
[1:18:59] shall stand amen
[1:19:02] people say well i just you know
[1:19:06] i don't understand what people think the
[1:19:08] word is
[1:19:10] but anyway let's move on by god's grace
[1:19:11] you love the lord
[1:19:13] you love the lord amen
[1:19:16] listen you know uh uh uh
[1:19:20] 17 uh first king i don't know how i've
[1:19:22] got that 17 24
[1:19:25] let's see 17 24.
[1:19:29] yeah i just read that but somehow
[1:19:31] somehow i
[1:19:33] must be the first verse
[1:19:39] i wrote something down wrong but let me
[1:19:41] let me read it
[1:19:42] it's in there we'll come back to
[1:19:45] correcting it
[1:19:46] you can find it for me
[1:19:50] oh mercy okay let's move on
[1:19:55] you know why i'm wrong because it's the
[1:19:56] wrong chapter 16
[1:20:01] of judges i'm sorry i got you
[1:20:06] hallelujah thank god for the flesh
[1:20:10] the flesh will let you down every time
[1:20:13] it will embarrass you
[1:20:17] but thank god for his grace amen judges
[1:20:19] 16.
[1:20:20] i wa i'm working with trees now i'm
[1:20:22] actually working
[1:20:23] with the image that you're seeing in the
[1:20:25] mirror what are you seeing
[1:20:27] okay because i want you to know you
[1:20:29] could be ordained of god
[1:20:31] called by god elected by god
[1:20:34] but reflecting the wrong stuff
[1:20:42] the first verse says then went samson to
[1:20:45] gazer
[1:20:46] and saw there and harlot and went
[1:20:49] in unto her y'all understand me
[1:20:53] this is the nazirite this is the one
[1:20:56] that god ordained
[1:20:59] to destroy the philistines
[1:21:02] and in his weak moment he finds a harlot
[1:21:07] and he lays with her
[1:21:10] i'mma show you something here because at
[1:21:13] that point in time you think well the
[1:21:14] lord should have departed
[1:21:16] but you understand he had a covenant he
[1:21:19] had a nazarite vow so god couldn't leave
[1:21:21] him
[1:21:22] you understand me that's the only reason
[1:21:24] why god don't leave you
[1:21:28] you have a promise you have a vow but
[1:21:30] look what he's doing look at the next
[1:21:32] verse look at the next verse
[1:21:34] and it was told the the the gazites
[1:21:38] saying samson is coming hither and they
[1:21:40] com
[1:21:41] com they compassed him in and laid and
[1:21:43] wait for him
[1:21:44] all night in the gate of the city
[1:21:48] and we're quiet all night saying in the
[1:21:51] morning when it is day
[1:21:52] we shall kill him and samson
[1:21:56] laid till midnight and rose at midnight
[1:22:00] and took the doors of the gate of the
[1:22:01] city and the two posts
[1:22:04] and went away with them bar and all
[1:22:07] and put them upon the shoulders and
[1:22:09] carried them up
[1:22:10] to the top of a hill that is before
[1:22:13] hebron he possessed the gates of his
[1:22:17] enemy
[1:22:18] even right after he had done evil
[1:22:24] y'all understand me
[1:22:27] because god made a covenant oh god
[1:22:31] y'all understand me there are many
[1:22:34] people who do evil
[1:22:35] but god stay with them and at the end of
[1:22:37] the day they shall possess the gates of
[1:22:39] their enemy
[1:22:42] hallelujah we all falter we all fall
[1:22:46] but god has ordained us to be a nazarite
[1:22:49] unto the lord
[1:22:51] and in his doing not ours
[1:22:54] and as long as we stay with this message
[1:22:56] of the seven seals and
[1:22:58] you know we we stay with that don't cut
[1:23:01] the locks
[1:23:02] stay with it god will honor you
[1:23:07] god will prove you on who you are
[1:23:10] don't worry god is there
[1:23:13] if you can see yourself in the scripture
[1:23:18] because the prophet preached a message
[1:23:20] once more and that was
[1:23:21] after 63 who was he talking to
[1:23:24] the pride of jesus christ he had already
[1:23:27] been kicked out of the church
[1:23:29] nobody wanted anything to do with him
[1:23:31] but they thought they were kicking him
[1:23:33] out
[1:23:34] but what he was doing was fulfilling
[1:23:35] revelations the third chapter
[1:23:38] where jesus was standing at the door
[1:23:40] trying to get in
[1:23:41] to that very age amen he ain't there who
[1:23:45] is that
[1:23:46] impersonator amen
[1:23:50] let me tell you something living saved
[1:23:54] is living right
[1:23:57] samson did that thing but at the end of
[1:23:59] the day
[1:24:00] samson had to die with his enemy
[1:24:04] you understand me you might do your
[1:24:06] wrong
[1:24:07] and god will be with you until he brings
[1:24:10] you to that place
[1:24:11] you're going to have to die with your
[1:24:13] enemy you're going to have to die to
[1:24:15] yourself
[1:24:16] you're going to have to die to your ways
[1:24:18] you're going to have to die to all of
[1:24:20] that
[1:24:21] but even in that you gain the victory
[1:24:24] everybody knows about samson
[1:24:30] everybody knows everybody knows he fell
[1:24:33] and trapped
[1:24:34] entrapped with delilah
[1:24:38] and delilah typed out the world
[1:24:43] and that's what happened to christians
[1:24:44] sometimes they've fallen trapped to the
[1:24:46] world
[1:24:48] but nothing can stop god's election
[1:24:52] nothing can stop the predestinated seed
[1:24:54] no matter what you go through
[1:24:57] god will bring you out you just trust
[1:25:00] him
[1:25:01] you might have to go through a rough
[1:25:02] time but god will be there with you
[1:25:06] did y'all catch it the same tree
[1:25:10] because he's a tree you're a tree
[1:25:14] yeah you bear fruit you're a tree
[1:25:17] the woman is the fruit tree and at the
[1:25:20] end of the day
[1:25:23] that's what the psalmist says i'll be
[1:25:24] like a tree planted by the river water i
[1:25:26] shall not be
[1:25:27] y'all understand me so we we must
[1:25:30] understand
[1:25:30] israel is a tree she's a fruit tree
[1:25:32] she's a fig tree
[1:25:34] you understand me you're a tree oh i can
[1:25:37] tell you some things but anyway
[1:25:38] at the end of the day amen
[1:25:41] god will see his seed
[1:25:46] not only prolonged but declared
[1:25:51] there'll be a lot of people in heaven
[1:25:53] you thought wasn't going to make it
[1:26:00] look at it look what samson did in just
[1:26:02] the second verse
[1:26:04] he's taking up the gates of gaza and
[1:26:08] then the prophet god
[1:26:09] preached a message possessing the gates
[1:26:11] of your enemy
[1:26:13] what was he saying you and i are living
[1:26:17] in an adulterous generation
[1:26:19] you know what that means everybody is
[1:26:27] it's the truth everybody is
[1:26:30] it takes 400 years to clean your blood
[1:26:35] and that means no mistakes in between
[1:26:42] so if you're not you won by birth
[1:26:46] you understand me that's why we need a
[1:26:49] new birth
[1:26:53] yo y'all don't let me tell y'all
[1:26:55] something
[1:26:56] gentiles are dogs and every gentile
[1:27:00] think that their blood so clean your
[1:27:02] blood ain't clean not one man blood
[1:27:04] is clean the only clean blood is the
[1:27:05] blood of christ
[1:27:10] yeah i think about that at times i said
[1:27:13] you know what
[1:27:14] people try to law and law this and law
[1:27:16] that and law this and all that
[1:27:17] and all they're doing is putting
[1:27:20] themselves and making themselves
[1:27:21] two-fold child of hell
[1:27:23] the only way you'll make it to heaven is
[1:27:25] to trust in the sacrificial
[1:27:27] lamb of god amen and all that he's done
[1:27:30] for you that's
[1:27:31] it and by you trusting in him he will
[1:27:34] make it happen for you
[1:27:37] let me hurry up listen a very thought
[1:27:42] you know i could say oh
[1:27:45] i'm going to go to go to school and i'm
[1:27:46] going to be a doctor
[1:27:48] a medical doctor now that's a real joke
[1:27:54] it is because it ain't there people say
[1:27:56] well you can be whatever you want to be
[1:27:58] that's a lie too
[1:28:04] you know because you got to understand
[1:28:06] that the gifts and callings of god
[1:28:08] is without repentance whatever god has
[1:28:11] given you
[1:28:12] you was born with it if you're gonna be
[1:28:15] a musician
[1:28:16] you had to have music in you somebody
[1:28:19] pulled it out of you but it was already
[1:28:21] there
[1:28:22] is that right a fig tree the the fruit's
[1:28:25] already in there
[1:28:29] it just takes seasonal changes to bring
[1:28:31] it out
[1:28:32] oh people say oh man i wish i could sing
[1:28:35] and y'all know there's a lot of people
[1:28:36] wish they could sing
[1:28:38] and you know what it doesn't matter
[1:28:40] inspiration doesn't change it
[1:28:46] they can be anointed but nothing is
[1:28:50] going to deceive that ear
[1:28:53] right it is what it is
[1:28:57] but to them they sound beautiful
[1:29:00] y'all know what i'm saying i mean it's
[1:29:03] this
[1:29:03] it is what it is people make comedy out
[1:29:05] of those kind of things
[1:29:06] but the truth of the matter is and a
[1:29:09] gift whatever gift it is it's in you
[1:29:11] already
[1:29:14] huh you didn't have to repent to get it
[1:29:18] right brother bannon was a prophet
[1:29:20] before he was born when he was born
[1:29:22] you understand me you were bribed before
[1:29:25] you were born
[1:29:26] you can't wish to be bright you you
[1:29:29] can't work to be bright
[1:29:31] there's nothing you can do those those
[1:29:34] things were
[1:29:35] elected and chosen let me put it it's
[1:29:38] just the word of god said jesus christ
[1:29:40] according to revelation is the beginning
[1:29:41] of god's creation
[1:29:43] and sometimes people think well god
[1:29:45] created god no that's not what he's
[1:29:47] saying
[1:29:47] he's saying jesus christ was the author
[1:29:50] of the creation the logos came out of
[1:29:53] him
[1:29:54] because god cannot be seen but god built
[1:29:57] him a house called logos and he stepped
[1:29:59] into it came out
[1:30:00] and began to create in oh he condescend
[1:30:04] what do you mean god is he was
[1:30:06] everywhere everything
[1:30:08] and he can't dis dimension no
[1:30:11] dimensional because god is here right
[1:30:14] now
[1:30:15] but he's in another dimension you can't
[1:30:18] see
[1:30:19] because you're trapped in this dimension
[1:30:22] hallelujah but one day we'll be free
[1:30:24] from this dimension
[1:30:26] and we'll see him just as he is you say
[1:30:29] i don't believe that brother
[1:30:30] it's true can y'all see those radio
[1:30:33] waves going through the
[1:30:35] you can't see the television vision
[1:30:36] coming through here they are
[1:30:39] that's in another dimension we call that
[1:30:41] the fourth dimension
[1:30:42] and science developed a crystal that
[1:30:45] could catch that
[1:30:46] place it in a box so you can see it
[1:30:49] real people real time
[1:30:53] real happenings hallelujah y'all
[1:30:55] understand me
[1:30:56] it's proof there's another dimension and
[1:30:59] if that dimension
[1:31:01] exists the dimension of the loss does
[1:31:03] too
[1:31:04] and if the dimension of the laws exists
[1:31:07] the
[1:31:07] dimension of heaven does too you
[1:31:10] understand me
[1:31:10] it's there whether you like it or not
[1:31:14] let me move on about god's grace i'm
[1:31:16] almost done
[1:31:18] i had to say all those things you say
[1:31:22] even your believing this message is a
[1:31:24] gift
[1:31:26] everybody can't believe it everybody
[1:31:30] can't see it everybody can't receive it
[1:31:32] it's a gift from god
[1:31:34] don't ever take it lightly amen that's
[1:31:38] true
[1:31:38] you understand me don't ever take it
[1:31:40] lightly
[1:31:43] i wish the brain the brain can't just do
[1:31:45] what it wants to do
[1:31:47] you know what i mean there was a time i
[1:31:49] thought the same thing oh you can be
[1:31:50] whatever you want to be
[1:31:55] i did i thought that for a long time and
[1:31:57] i recently found out
[1:31:58] that's not true
[1:32:01] yeah how you're going to tell a man who
[1:32:03] who can't sing
[1:32:04] you can be a top-notch singer
[1:32:08] all you got to do is practice practice
[1:32:10] and go
[1:32:12] practice ain't going to help that
[1:32:14] because you got to understand singing is
[1:32:16] a revelation
[1:32:17] it's something revealed you don't even
[1:32:20] know how you do it but you do it
[1:32:24] there's no science about it they can try
[1:32:27] to produce it but
[1:32:28] there's a lot of people with good vocal
[1:32:30] cords and they still can't hold a tune
[1:32:32] let me move on so inspiration is always
[1:32:37] good
[1:32:38] you know you see inspiration all of us
[1:32:40] have inspiration and time but
[1:32:41] all inspiration is not right everything
[1:32:44] that comes to you by way of inspiration
[1:32:46] needs to be checked by the word of god
[1:32:50] there are so many people say well i know
[1:32:52] i i know what god did for me i had a
[1:32:54] brother that really just
[1:32:55] broke my heart i went through the
[1:32:56] scriptures showed him all of the things
[1:32:58] about baptism and everything else he saw
[1:33:00] it he literally cried he went back home
[1:33:02] they changed his mind he came back and
[1:33:04] he said i'm not gonna do it
[1:33:05] and i was just so broken because under
[1:33:08] the inspiration
[1:33:10] he was able to see it but once the
[1:33:12] inspiration left
[1:33:15] he chose not to believe it so when you
[1:33:18] come to a truth and you choose not to
[1:33:20] believe it then you become blind
[1:33:22] it's like what ephesus what the the all
[1:33:25] of the ages did you know when the
[1:33:27] you know methodists and the pentecostals
[1:33:28] went on beyond that and those who
[1:33:30] closed their eyes to that they were left
[1:33:33] behind
[1:33:35] and so is it with the word of god now
[1:33:37] once god you're walking
[1:33:38] he is the shepherd he's the god remember
[1:33:40] i told you he's guide you and
[1:33:42] lead you into all truth and let me tell
[1:33:44] you like this
[1:33:46] god people always
[1:33:50] look insane
[1:33:55] they never make sense can you imagine
[1:33:59] how crazy moses
[1:34:00] noah looked it's gonna rain
[1:34:10] ain't no water no clouds no nothing
[1:34:13] it's gonna rain what is it anyway
[1:34:17] [Laughter]
[1:34:20] what is rain they didn't know what rain
[1:34:22] was because during that time it never
[1:34:24] rained
[1:34:25] do came up from the ground read your
[1:34:26] bible
[1:34:29] and then we said oh water coming down
[1:34:30] from heaven
[1:34:32] they looked up in the blue skies
[1:34:36] but they didn't know in the laboratory
[1:34:39] of
[1:34:39] man he was trying to figure things out
[1:34:43] just like he's doing today see it wasn't
[1:34:46] god who destroyed it
[1:34:48] it was man science in their laboratory
[1:34:51] don't cheat what folks are oh these
[1:34:53] people weren't cavemen they didn't have
[1:34:55] no clubs coming out of a
[1:34:57] they were far more intelligent than we
[1:35:00] are
[1:35:00] we're just coming in my day and time we
[1:35:03] just come up with what they call
[1:35:04] pie and you go to egypt and you find out
[1:35:07] that that's how they built
[1:35:09] those kind of stones with mathematically
[1:35:11] they were using pie
[1:35:13] and all that other stuff they were using
[1:35:15] i don't know whether they call it the
[1:35:16] same thing as we call it but
[1:35:18] the point is we could they were
[1:35:20] mathematical geniuses
[1:35:23] they were able to build that pyramid
[1:35:25] amen in the center of the earth the sin
[1:35:27] of this and the sin of that
[1:35:28] and it all came equal to the sun
[1:35:35] and noah was far better a boat builder
[1:35:37] than the titanic man
[1:35:42] and nora didn't have half the equipment
[1:35:45] he had
[1:35:47] you understand me the difference between
[1:35:49] noah's boat the ark
[1:35:50] and the titanic is that god built the
[1:35:53] ark
[1:35:54] he used noah to do it but it was all
[1:35:57] blueprinted by god
[1:35:59] you see what i'm saying that's why
[1:36:01] people are a rapture and i'm i'm closing
[1:36:03] i'm trying to stop
[1:36:04] a rapture look in the mirror folks who
[1:36:07] are you
[1:36:09] you you say your bride you should be
[1:36:12] dressed like one
[1:36:13] you should adorn yourself like one you
[1:36:15] should carry yourself like one
[1:36:18] right you should stay clear you should
[1:36:20] stay as clean as possible
[1:36:23] because though we know when we mess up
[1:36:24] we got a bleach
[1:36:27] you know but what i'm trying to say is
[1:36:29] we're different from all the others
[1:36:31] not that we're trying to be he chose us
[1:36:33] to be
[1:36:34] we're not a vastly we're an esther
[1:36:39] we come from nowhere with no name
[1:36:42] but yet and still god has given us a
[1:36:44] name
[1:36:45] and you and i must always look in this
[1:36:47] bible and say where am i
[1:36:49] lord where am i
[1:36:52] let me look into this word revelations
[1:36:55] 19 7 says let be glad and rejoice
[1:36:58] and get honored to for for the beverage
[1:37:00] of the lamb
[1:37:01] is come and his wife have made herself
[1:37:04] ready
[1:37:05] made herself ready
[1:37:08] and you know the problem is with when
[1:37:11] you say
[1:37:11] made it make you think that you've got a
[1:37:14] labor
[1:37:15] you know what you labor to do die to
[1:37:18] your will
[1:37:20] move your will out of the way and let
[1:37:22] his will be done that's what jesus said
[1:37:23] lord not my will but thine will be
[1:37:26] done when you move your will god can
[1:37:28] place his will in you
[1:37:31] coming from the message presented
[1:37:33] present stage of my ministry he brother
[1:37:35] said i hope he will crown my ministry of
[1:37:38] this
[1:37:40] of letting me take the clothes of the
[1:37:42] word
[1:37:43] and dress the bride in the clothes of
[1:37:45] the word
[1:37:46] and for his righteousness i hope he will
[1:37:49] crown me
[1:37:50] let me stand on that day and say behold
[1:37:54] the lamb of god
[1:37:55] that takes away the sins of the world
[1:38:00] hmm this ain't no you're not reading
[1:38:02] some story book
[1:38:03] are you not reading some little books
[1:38:05] that this uh seventh grade education man
[1:38:08] that's why god did it that way
[1:38:11] people so smart and that's exactly what
[1:38:13] happened in the days of john
[1:38:15] god god stays john like a wild man
[1:38:18] think about it elijah coming out the
[1:38:21] wilderness hair all bushy and
[1:38:23] not comb breath you know and everything
[1:38:25] else
[1:38:26] popping p locus in his mouth like
[1:38:28] peanuts
[1:38:32] they thought he was crazy and he's
[1:38:35] screaming
[1:38:37] and hollering and calling them names
[1:38:42] oh and yet god was hiding behind
[1:38:47] that veil then he took jesus his son
[1:38:52] and it made it took jesus born in
[1:38:55] bethlehem
[1:38:56] he took him down to egypt from egypt to
[1:38:59] nazareth
[1:39:00] and nazareth was one of the wickedest
[1:39:02] city ever
[1:39:03] and that name stuck with him jesus of
[1:39:07] nazareth
[1:39:09] why it was god cloaking himself
[1:39:13] putting a bad name on him so that those
[1:39:17] who could see him
[1:39:18] won't see him because of the natural but
[1:39:21] would be able to see him because of the
[1:39:25] did supernatural same thing to william
[1:39:26] branham mama half breed
[1:39:30] right dad is a drunk
[1:39:34] didn't have no education y'all
[1:39:36] understand
[1:39:37] but he had the pillow fire you
[1:39:40] understand me
[1:39:42] you know the point is that god looks at
[1:39:44] you and
[1:39:45] he took you out from every one of us
[1:39:46] that came from some part of life
[1:39:49] disgusting all of us wasn't raised up in
[1:39:51] the church
[1:39:53] some of us some of us have bad lives
[1:39:57] don't you they were so bad you can't
[1:39:59] even do nothing on testimony at that
[1:40:01] time
[1:40:02] you can't tell at all
[1:40:06] try to tell it all you be in trouble all
[1:40:08] them carnal christians be
[1:40:10] in there
[1:40:14] you understand me but he took us
[1:40:18] think y'all i tell you what we can't see
[1:40:20] it quite yet
[1:40:22] but i tell you what it's going to take
[1:40:26] jesus
[1:40:27] to wipe the tears from your eyes
[1:40:30] because otherwise they will never stop
[1:40:36] it's going to take him to stop it
[1:40:40] because we're going to have joy we're
[1:40:42] going to miss our loved ones
[1:40:44] we're going to things people who won't
[1:40:45] make we're going to and then all of a
[1:40:47] sudden he comes
[1:40:49] and the prophet god said when he wiped
[1:40:50] the tears away from your eyes
[1:40:52] you won't even remember those who who
[1:40:54] who you left behind
[1:40:57] because heaven won't be heaven if you
[1:41:00] could think about those lost
[1:41:01] relatives that didn't make it
[1:41:06] you're gonna wipe all that away from
[1:41:07] your memory
[1:41:09] and all you will remember is the good
[1:41:11] part
[1:41:13] you love the lord constantly stay in the
[1:41:16] mirror
[1:41:17] look this is examining times
[1:41:20] we won't we're not going to be purged
[1:41:23] we're being purged by the word
[1:41:24] now foolish virgins will be purged
[1:41:28] but the bride of jesus christ she's
[1:41:30] washing herself by the water of the word
[1:41:33] right now and we've got more than enough
[1:41:38] more than enough you love god
[1:41:41] let us stand
[1:41:51] god knows i hope everybody's been
[1:41:52] blessed amen
[1:41:54] i i try to preach in love and i trust
[1:41:58] that you feel what i feel
[1:42:01] because you know this is a time of
[1:42:03] urgency
[1:42:05] and things are getting more critical
[1:42:09] all over the world
[1:42:12] your freedom has been taken from you and
[1:42:14] you don't even know it yet
[1:42:18] and things are not going to get better
[1:42:20] things are going to get worse
[1:42:22] and you got to be prepared y'all
[1:42:25] understand me
[1:42:26] love your enemies y'all got enough love
[1:42:28] to love your enemy
[1:42:33] y'all better know it you gotta love you
[1:42:35] [Laughter]
[1:42:38] you know because they coming your way
[1:42:41] you know
[1:42:43] a lot of christians i'm telling you i
[1:42:44] don't know how we're going to
[1:42:48] do it i just know that if it started off
[1:42:50] well peter tried to defend himself and
[1:42:52] got in trouble
[1:42:54] same thing at the end you better know
[1:42:57] you better have
[1:42:58] some of that anointing
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:01] real anointing the kind that when they
[1:43:05] walk close to you they'll feel it
[1:43:07] and fear will strike you understand me
[1:43:11] you gotta have that that kind of
[1:43:14] anointing
[1:43:16] that will it's like like the scripture
[1:43:19] says
[1:43:19] a wall of fire built around
[1:43:23] that's the kind of anointing we need and
[1:43:26] people of god
[1:43:28] that's the kind god wants to give you we
[1:43:31] are coming into the very image and
[1:43:32] likeness of jesus christ y'all
[1:43:33] understand what that means
[1:43:36] that's beyond anything we can comprehend
[1:43:38] but god says i'm taking you there
[1:43:40] follow me i'll take you there
[1:43:44] and i believe with all of my heart
[1:43:47] right now we're all struggling
[1:43:51] we know what's right
[1:43:54] we want to do right and yet we have
[1:43:57] these little things that seem to
[1:44:01] hold but understand god
[1:44:05] the lord jesus christ he breaks
[1:44:07] everything
[1:44:09] he destroys all the works of the enemy
[1:44:11] it's already done
[1:44:13] but we need to learn how to accept what
[1:44:16] has been done
[1:44:19] i know with all my heart that things are
[1:44:22] happening
[1:44:24] and everybody you know we have our own
[1:44:27] problems
[1:44:28] your problem's different from mine mine
[1:44:31] is different from yours
[1:44:33] but i do understand what my problems are
[1:44:35] doing for me
[1:44:36] they're making me better they're molding
[1:44:39] me into the image and likeness of christ
[1:44:42] they're shaping me so that when i look
[1:44:45] in the word okay lord
[1:44:47] i can see i didn't do that but you did
[1:44:49] it you did that
[1:44:51] for me and you know
[1:44:54] how many y'all know this truth you
[1:44:57] you've had people scream and yell or do
[1:44:59] something to you it could be anything
[1:45:02] and you couldn't even respond
[1:45:06] god kept you and you know in the devil
[1:45:10] and the devil is on the left side of you
[1:45:11] said
[1:45:12] if they just should have known me just a
[1:45:14] few years ago
[1:45:17] if they would have known me then see
[1:45:21] but that's the devil talking to you
[1:45:24] because
[1:45:25] we have come to be new creatures
[1:45:28] not some patched up job not some
[1:45:31] you know thread tying us to the old man
[1:45:34] everything has been savored everything
[1:45:36] has been cut
[1:45:37] we've been free and the bible said he he
[1:45:39] whom the son is set free is free indeed
[1:45:41] and that's why i keep saying look in
[1:45:43] here the prophet of god brought us an
[1:45:45] image of jesus christ by the word of god
[1:45:47] and we must learn to see that image and
[1:45:50] walk in it focus on it
[1:45:52] until that image we become that very
[1:45:54] image
[1:45:56] he didn't eat an air from the word but
[1:45:59] he
[1:45:59] brought us an image when the whole
[1:46:01] church world and lost the image he ate
[1:46:04] the
[1:46:04] you know what put your picture on the
[1:46:07] wall

[1:46:10] power in the word of god
[1:46:12] and you and i must understand that that
[1:46:15] image that he's brought to us
[1:46:16] amen we must keep it we must keep it
[1:46:19] because that's what we must become

[1:46:26] and it's late it is as it is right now

[1:46:47] to be

[1:46:49] behind and the only way that you can
[1:46:50] ever make the tree good
