coming along the time I had to see us to stand appreciate you I had to see the boys back second Corinthians please fifth chapter Galatians 6 second Corinthians the fifth chapter and the seventeenth verse therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new Galatians please the sixth chapter we're going to read the fifteenth verse for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature one more scripture Genesis 1 how many really enjoy brother John last time he was here what a real blessing thank God for his amazing grace Dennis's 26 1 26 through 28 Genesis 1:26 to 28 then God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and every or and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and in the image of critics of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth let us pray dear Heavenly Father we come before your Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for your presence father and we thank you Lord for your grace and how you give us even more grace when we need it bless each and every heart here this evening or this morning Lord as we approach a word there is nothing I can say to these people but I pray that you'll let your ministering spirit let your angel come down and speak to your people father break and destroy the yokes are the enemy heal and deliver Lord whatever that is needed Oh God I pray that your grace and mercy would be with us this morning have thine own way Lord and cleanse us and forgive us for any and everything that we may have done Oh God that has been displeasing in that sight let nothing Lord that I may have said or done or even thought hinder this service cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated for a long time in our Christian journey we perhaps had our understanding or our thoughts of what salvation is and was all about but in these last days we have had a profit that God revealed his thoughts to and this profit was the very voice of God for our age we realize now that the prophet of God is going off to sea but the voice that echoed through his voice is still alive and we realized that salvation is a plan of God that we must realize that only God can do is that right the Bible says salvation is of the Lord you can't save yourself I can't save myself no one of not one of us can save ourselves but the question is what are we being saved from and you and I must understand that salvation as I said is of the Lord and therefore God is saving us from something when Adam and Eve was in the Garden of Eden before the fall they did not need salvation they were in perfect harmony with God it was after the fall the place salvation came into play first of all we realized by God's grace that Adam found himself in a place that he had never been before and Adam found himself naked and Adam found himself lost and when the voice of God came in the cool of the evening Adam Adam we're out now Adam was hiding because he also found that he was naked now before the fall Adam was naked but since sin had now come in Adam realized that his nakedness was not the way that he was to present himself before God because before the fall Adam was clothed in the glory of God he was robed in holiness he was clothed a man with the Shekinah glory but after the fall it brought in a separation between man and God we call it according to the prophets terminology breach there was a breach now that there is a gap we need a savior we needed somebody to bridge the gap some of the things that I saw in the scripture is that we realize Amen this morning that that that mankind had now Lord himself to a beast and though he were in the image of a beast he was not a beast because he had God on the inside and everybody that doesn't have God on the inside is nothing other than a beast but it was a God that we had on the inside that made us who and what we were and are and so evasion was not only just to pull someone out of the river but it was also to quicken him and bring him back to life you know how somebody is drowned and they still got that moment of time that they could be resuscitated that individual put their mouths on that mouth and pumps and you know the procedures that they do and it's all about bringing that person back to life because God said to Adam the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die Adam did die spiritually because realizing amen by God's grace when you are separated from God you are dead even the Bible tells us that as a woman if she lives in pleasure though she lives she's dead and so we realize Amen that we have been chosen as children of God to be in the very image and likeness of God this is what Adam the first Adam was all about and even though he was earthly he bore power and authority he he had dominion over the fish and the sea had dominion over all of God's creation everything that moved Adam had dominion but because a man the devil introduced unbelief he introduced doubt and when he any when he introduced doubt and unbelief to Eve Amen it also brought about fear all the attributes of death accompanied the fall of Adam and Eve and to be honest with you when we're born into this world we are recipients of their fall everything that Adam and Eve lost we lost one thing about Adam and Eve they had the opportunity of knowing what it meant to be ruler they understood the authority that they had but you know like many Christians they did not appreciate it enough to hold on to it my subject this morning is the creation of God in you the creation of God in you because God just didn't come to restore us to what we call a restoration of the first Adam because God bypassed that one because the first Adam was just the Lord over the earth but the second Adam was lord over heaven in earth so God comes to restore us and to bring us to a higher level of his creation a level that once it's reached you and I will never have to worry or be concerned about falling again because this world that God is now making an establishing he's doing it for a people that have been time tested a people that know good and evil but they choose good over evil see in the beginning Adam they didn't know good and evil and they chose evil over good but this second Adam the second creation is given good and evil and they choose good this is why Amen Jesus told them make the tree good or make it evil hallelujah and how can we make this tree good when we were born evil see God only God had the solution before the foundation of the world he put a seed on the inside of us hallelujah I thank God that he is a sore oh come on somebody because you got to realize that the seed in which God's soul was good there are bad seats but the Bible said the wicked one he sold those seeds but the good seed can never be transformed into a bad seed hallelujah God has a law that every seemeth bring forth of its kind is that right amen listen Robert God says in adoption for this may just choke you to death but did you know that mean that a sons of God are a mature gods how many ever know that how many knows that Jesus said so the Bible Jesus said did you did not your law say itself that ye are God's and if you are call them God which God said in Genesis 2 that they were God's because they were have full dominion over the Dominion of the earth he didn't say portion Dominion he said full hallelujah even he had four dominion over is that right commercial Ari not only did God give this second creation dominion over the earth but he gave us dominion over heaven is that right the Bible said cast down every evil imagination that exalts itself against the Word of God hallelujah so we have the ability to not only rule here but rule there but you got to be built up God ain't gonna use a child you got to go through something you got to go through a lot of tests you got to go through a other hardships hallelujah but you don't worry about it the victory is ours God has already given us a big tray ba because the power is in the DNA Alleluia that they listen he give him dominion over all things and he lost his God ship he lost his sonship he lost his Dominion Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again writing for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God would be manifested when the power of God will walk out hallelujah and will take every power that Satan got away from him come on sematic demon we're not gonna ask forward with taking it back everything that the devil stole from us we're taking it back hallelujah that's why the devil even he says he tries to fight you and in destroys you in the area of faith because he know that faith can move mountains hello faith can stop the Sun and I'm not talking about the su-lin I'm talking about the s/o in is that right faith can do create all things is that right the Bible said by faith God created hallelujah and when God was creating I was there you were there hallelujah but we need to elevate our minds we need to come up and realize Amen that God is beyond anything we can imagine one of the brothers and I his name brother Richard shared something with me yesterday and and I wasn't gonna implement it but I thought with the subject that God was giving me because I know that everybody every one of us are going through great battles and when you're going through battles you know that's when the sacrifice of praise must be it's difficult to praise God when you're in pain but you say give him the praise hallelujah is that right joke didn't have what we had but job said though he's lame I'm gonna trust him y'all huh yeah somebody help me here this morning Amen we got to come up because the devil is trying to bring us down but we are the resurrection hallelujah amen wherever he takes us we come back up y'all hear me it doesn't matter how low he dangerous we come back is that right it just went fall seven times in a day and the Bible said he gets up hallelujah I appreciate the Brethren who helps me out sometimes you know they people forget you know the pastor you know he's part / - and you know I go through my battles I have my test the fact I'm going through a lot of things I call it the flood it's okay to go through the flood when you realize who the standard is and you got to realize I understand it if God has brought a flood then I must stand did you realize what a flood is let's take let's take the tsunami that hit a man Japan what did it do everything that was in his way it moved it out of the way it disintegrated the like like an atomic bomb had hit the place everything that thought it had a foundation was moved out of the way right so what do you think happening to you you're doing things you know you shouldn't be doing because you test you allowing Satan to move you off your foundation where is the where is the standard God place us here to win the battles not to lose them and he put that test on you because he knew you loved him enough to stay so y'all hear me patience is in love love waits for everything is that right let me live it living let me go back to this flood because the Lord just showed me the other day because I've been listening the greatest battle ever fought was in your mind and didn't realize I was going through the greatest battle didn't understand that God was speaking directly to me at this present time and I thought to myself I said Lord you know how we do sometimes we let these battles in our mind we don't even realize that God is testing us we don't even know that these battles have come they have come to make us stronger and we just allow save them battle in our mind Oh nobody don't see me I just lost one I just lost - oh I yield to do this I yielded to death and you know not even thinking that because of your failing to overcome and to gain victory in these mind battles you're not moving forward because we say they just mind battles oh the devil devil is battling me but what are you doing with the battle what are you doing with the fight is that right it's not how big the like like the Prophet I said it's not how big or how small the dog is is how big the fighters in the dog Paulo lujah I cannot see myself surrendering to this world or the things of this world because I'm under fire hallelujah because greater is He that's in us than he that is in the world it is amazing how we want to quit on God when it's the devil that's doing us that way it is the devil who comes to kill steal and destroy don't get an attitude with God he's on your side the Bible says oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out listen you can't judge God his ways are parents finding out I always tell people I said listen one thing for certain you wasn't a Jonah God didn't throw you in the belly of a whale hallelujah somebody help me here and God used oh because God made Jonah and God to use you because God made you if God want to send you to the fire who's going to stop him that's why the Bible said in all things give thanks o you who have known the mind of the Lord or who have been his counselor or who has first given it to him and it shall be recompense unto him again for of him and through him and to him and all things to whom glory forever amen hallelujah think about it when you and I must understand that God can do whatever he wants to do god don't care about how you look or how you think you look when he wants to use you he'll use you I think it was Seymour who had a cross-eyed or something it was something a bad about his appearance but you think that stopped that man from calling on the name of the Lord Jesus in a time when when when when Apostolic or holiness people were literally called crazy but there was something on the inside of Seymour that wanted God no matter what the cost that's the only way you're going to get him is when you want him so that there is not a price that the devil can give you nothing he can pay you to keep you from getting to God great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable now I want you to understand it's talking about the God that's in you his greatness is unsearchable now if he's in you your greatness is unsearchable but if we limit ourselves hallelujah sometimes amen you think out this way I think if God turned water into wine and the water has no soul what is just water and he did that for people at a wedding and most of those people perhaps was going to get tipsy and whatever law he turned the water in what he did a favor somebody help me then if I've got a condition that's more important than turning water into wine is there anything too hard for God somebody help me here when does God I'm skipping my notes but when does God becomes real to you everybody said he no God oh I worship God but is he real is he tangible can you get a hold of him when you need it can you talk to it and hear talk back it's God real don't you tell him that any what's the use of being a Christian if he ain't real somewhere down the road your faith must become sight is that right Abraham had never seen him before but he knew advice Abraham moved by his voice never seeing God before but because of him faith Abraham had faith in Putin it brought the invisible God to a place of visibility and one day the very God that Abraham was worshiping walked on the scene that's how real God is it happened with our own prophet the very god he believed in one day showed up as a pillar of high as the angel of the Lord somebody help me see God becomes real when he does things for you hmm David David was a shepherd boy scoring of his own daddy his dad was a shame of him right wanted to hide him away from Samuel Sammy said no you got one more hallelujah y'all hear me heaven Sammy said no there's got to be one more God tells me there's what I need to not see and that's what you must understand sometimes being an outcast of being the black sheep of the family is not so bad hallelujah you know mo you might be the black sheep in this family this earthly family but in God's eyes you're the chosen one hallelujah because all of us can relate to it amen how our natural families have treated us but when it comes to God like somebody says I got a seat at the table I got carried away there but dear you and I must realize Amen that our God is God when does he become real to you he said you know in that day I am in the father the father's in me and I am in you now if I got the God if you got the ins unsearchable God in you or you got the omnipotent in you then what what what what cannot be done do you have power over demons did God say tell you you have power over demons he said whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus car he didn't say figure it out he didn't say mathematically work it out he said if you have say if you can believe it it'll come to pass but the problem is we reason we allow Satan to come and reason you know it somehow God has so much patience with us and we think about how you know Peter walked on the water and then all of a sudden you started reason y'all note I'm sorry that's what we do we start out in the battle amen yo I'm coming devil and all of a sudden he flashes the waves in your face the water is hitting you the pressure and all of the things of life is coming at you and all of a sudden you're looking around like oh my god how is this gonna happen as soon as you do that you began to sing God is a God that can make the impossible possible huh he is the god I serve and you need to be the God that you sir hallelujah fear not little flock it is the father's good pleasure to give you what the kingdom don't worry about it Hebrews 1:10 says and our Lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hand they shall perish but thou remain it and they that they all shall wax cold as death a garment and as a vesture sure I'll fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same no matter what changes around here God is the same and the years shall not fail but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemy thy footstool are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation this is why we miss it because we look at brother Brooks and you out wish you could see my notes most of the time most of the time I'm speaking what he wants me to speak and we fail to see there's an angel standing right here speaking to me talking to me not just me every minister that's ministered are given as a gift from God as an angel that ministers to him not just a prophet but every preacher a ministering spirits and there are angels that know the future that knows the presence and that knows amen what took place in the past and they stand here as litsa fire up a men speaking to you and we'll go well know what that what not a good sermon and you fail to hear but the Bible said lost sheep here is my voice you know when you've been in the military a little bar one thing for certain they will build you up there were high q-- and said oh you got to go at this thing and you got to do this even even in when it comes to sports it is that right you see any men before they get out there to battle they jump in and all oh whatever they say nowadays a man but the whole thing is to get them into the atmosphere a football or get them into the atmosphere whatever it may be is out I'm saying amen and folks that's what the preachers all about you and I are in the greatest battle right now that right the battles in your mind every one of us fighting hallelujah everyone up let's put this way got battles we got going on and what is it the battle between Christ and the Antichrist and the Antichrist will always tell you something contrary to the word is that right now you've got to determine if you don't know your word how you gonna know who's speaking to you hallelujah is that right because remember that devil use exactly almost all the words God said to admony almost everything but he change the meaning of it by adding one word y'all hear me I'm saying something to you because I want you to realize by God's grace you're not going to oh I got something for you this morning here you know we look at things and we fail to see that if one word broken brought us into this chaos we must believe the whole word and have faith in it you can't just love God when everything's going good you got to love God why because this is a marriage ceremony this is a marriage situation these are the devlins part situation and death would never do his part but I remember those vows for better for worse oh my god don't you we love the better I can go shopping but when the worst can't law I don't have it you see we have a hard time with the worst oh you thought your husband was a prince and he wasn't gonna have no mistakes he's human oh you thought your wife was gonna be perfect and she wasn't gonna have no mistakes she's human hallelujah and guess what brother Brown said he takes those two stones and rubble God elected you to rub each other together to smooth each other out colony and so you must understand we're stones and we rub against things hallelujah but God is robbing and moving all of those were pieces all of those sharp edges y'all know what the sharp edges are how many those with a hammer tools that we have with one another God see you gotta get rid of that you're not gonna have that in heaven you got to remember that you didn't come Amen just to be a church you come to conquer you were born a warrior hallelujah you know it's amazing how you know in on television they got all now I think they got a lot of superheroes now that are women with a natural type the spiritual say the knows he's being whipped right now by a woman all her the bride and you must realized by God's grace you can't become that until you train you know how you train you got all these pairs in the beginning but they remove the past the past got to go you got to feel that blow hallelujah you have to feel that pain well because that area needs to be strengthened I'm sorry God cannot spare us hallelujah we're gonna be rulers of heaven listen in the revelation of Jesus Christ he said now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts now we don't heard this quote so many time but how many of us have been fighting for it but the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it by what way making the Word of God of none effect coming in here salty and cold coming here in all upset and everything else and you can't even give God worship he's a snicker hallelujah most of the time you don't even have problems until you about ready to come to church he is a slicker amen and you and I must realize amen his whole purpose is to make you lukewarm because he knows God attitude about being lukewarm right tsommo and it's a sad thing as a pastor and don't get me wrong I'm not talking to the people that really need help in cause but I have people calling me you know almost trying to tell me well you know imma use this as a scenario should I eat white bread or wheat that's just how ridiculous it gets eat a piece of each to satisfy you right but people don't understand by God's grace and then there are certain things missing God did not call me to be a priest is that right how are you going to come to know God if you don't get on your knees yourself cry out to God yourself but the truth is we need each other I'm not against about praying for one another but there are times and then you need to call on the name of the larger cell is that right you need to know him you need to know him so well that when he speaks you know it's him you don't have the question whether it be his voice you know his voice is this okay see this this making it lukewarm and falling powerless and I hate I hate it I hate seeing a powerless congregation that's those were my words see it exposes Satan revealing the works attempted destruction of God's people and the discretion excuse me discrediting of God's Word right down to the time you know here it is we got the coming of the Lord and we still battling on what we should wear and what we shouldn't wear trivial things hallelujah we ought to be a past what what is godly and what is not godly that right we shouldn't eat oh those of us Amen you know I don't mean to sound like I'm screaming but I'm really in a place in my life I want to see the supernatural I want to see God on the move I want to see not just in me I see God I see God in me but I'm talking about the church right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire and said he is discrediting the church he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what if she is he didn't say what they are she is individually and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army hello why because he is unsearchable and if he's in you you unsearchable and if he's invincible you are invincible but we let our trials knock us knock it down oh woe is me woe is me with all this power you got even in your mouth did you know that the Bible says even lay on your tongue he says life and death is within right there hmm and you and I must realize that Satan want to keep us in that loose place cuz he knows that if we ever ever get out of his little box will expand he knows he's in trouble but don't you understand this it's already prophesied the word has already been spoken Alleluia is not him that will it know he that run it the God who shows mercy hallelujah don't you know God has already determined who you gonna be and what you gonna be hallelujah the devil lookin at you and he's a puzzle he's puzzled he doesn't know it meant because he sees all those weaknesses but see he underestimated Samson two and God had a surprise with him right now you look like you weak and you don't have nothing going for you but don't you worry all you need to do is get before God says Oh Lord once more well see what we fail to see is we always people always do do things the hard way the Bible says seek you first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and all these things will be at it but we want God to add all these things and God I'll get righteous then no no it doesn't work that way you get righteous first and God will add hallelujah is that okay Amen see what it is Amen by God's grace if the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church that was so powerful that was so powerful how the mark of the beast and all of that is right there before us and right in our faces will we choose a church over the holy spirit and we do it it all depends on what the preacher who the preacher is hallelujah and we are believing over the word prevent him didn't preached no separate word he preached the same word God just elevated it magnified it even preached that a church is supposed to diminish he preached a message that will increase us bring us a minute to the heavens hallelujah is that right that's what he said he talked about even in those astronauts and how those astronauts typed out the bride and how she supposed to be in the atmosphere how she supposed to go beyond the sound barrier you know there's a lot of ground to cover but what we're doing we let the world distract us that's what's happening the world is appealing to us Oh Samson Oh Samson yeah that devil is calling in your ear and instead of you praying and doing things you own yo you don't even realize those are things for their need it use them as they need it but when it becomes a stronghold whoo it becomes a slow hole you said breathlessly I just lost my phone new way I left it and Delta wouldn't help me and I thought to myself I never felt okay but it wasn't Delta fault y'all give me the Holy Spirit said don't plug that up I said well I remember it huh have nots the Lord say things you don't do that but Oh Lord I won't forget and you do you don't even know it's the Lord at the time until you did you forget cuz the devil ain't gonna tell you that you understand me my point is I'm still trying to get used to my new phone I was addicted it has a strong home and you see other people I was badly addicted but not like everybody else and there was a not like everybody else I remember going I remember going down to the lake n' and here was a couple a men in their boat they were both on their cell phone I'm coming a little canoe out there on the lake thinking that they were all sweetie you know holding here I don't think it it's getting bad oh lord help us but these distractions it's tearing up the house is tearing up the family relationship it's destroying a lot of things it's the truth people it's good and he's evil but it seems like the evil is taking over help us Lord may the Holy Spirit help us I don't even mean to go there but God took me there see she can do the greater lurks if they get a true revelation of the two spins within the framework of a Christian Church I said this the other day I said if a person don't have the Holy Ghost they have no right not having they have no right having an iPhone hello it's hard for those of us who have the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost don't worry about your children putting things on there they're going to do it even if it ain't on there they're gonna they gonna find a way to get it hallelujah oh come on somebody stir truth I was preaching on some now down there I won't say I'm preaching about you know brothers in there pornography and everything else and you know and I'm here it is people having trouble with their marriages and everything else I'm now I'm looking that way because I don't want to see nobody spirit but my point is here's the brother telling me about his wife and everything else and he flips through his cards his pitches for God he had it violated my eyes and you know the Holy Ghost is funny the hold it goes to something else he trying to move it and it stuck I didn't say nothing I didn't have to say anything you busted boy God just got you you know and instead of say Oprah Bruce I'm so sorry he moved on like nothing she he's bound and he's wondering why he's having a problem with this marriage who help me Lord see I want you to understand that the only way Satan can get into your life is that you must open the door right because he come knocking don't mean you have to open the door and what door you opening you opened the door of your mind and the greatest battle ever fought he says is your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listen to your conscience listen to your memory listen to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is called every fear is gone every sensation is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the Word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against that see it is what we we fail to see that that word is our fortress that word is our defense that word is our life hallelujah and if you are the Lord you are to be the word hallelujah is that right Oh every time I think about it remember I think brother brother he hit on the same thing I had a thought last week about that about that woman who's who husband was a drunk and went out and got his buddy said I'm gonna show come home and show you a real Christian and how he she came home fix me some food woman you know fix me some food she fix him food and everything else you know her son he got over there just I don't want it and they all walked out and looked through the window to see how she was gonna react Oh Lord whoo she's a real question she was not American woman and somebody I wouldn't want to be like American women y'all would be shaming yourself you better be thankful for what you got you don't want to be an American woman you know they even got a song I wasn't listening to that channel but I heard it somewhere don't marry an American woman if she's a Christian that's a different story is that Alright and she bowed down over there and she said must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross did you know that there are times in your moom and life there are moments in your life you don't feel God feel God you don't feel him you don't see him you don't know what he's doing where he's gonna go what's the next move you have no idea and you got to just stand and the Word of God says when you've done all this day stand that right Moses who had done great exploits in Egypt doesn't great everything a man broke each up to their knees can y'all hear me I'm not whining and my English is okay in it anyway you come to a place and here's Moses who done all of these exploits in the name of Jehovah the great I am and all of a sudden God leaves him in a place where he had no directions God had already told him going to the Red Sea got there God said unto Satan let Pharaoh loose hallelujah and that's where he is but this was a flood but it wasn't water it was a flood of people and they knew this flood was coming to wipe him out but who was the standard Moses was the standard those people supposed to have been the standard seeing all that God had done but they failed Moses failed and began to cry out to God but God didn't tell him what next to do water one side this on that side he didn't have no idea and God said stand still but he didn't see he he knew that if I should stand still God gonna do something say a lot of time we don't stand still long enough you know I mean we want God to do something we moving and trying to fix it know how Moses was going to fix that situation their situation God puts in your life you cannot fix you can't Oh God can God can fix it he's the only one I know that could put Humpty Dumpty together again is that true if you break an egg can God put it back Missy y'all y'all don't even know cuz we never had to ask him but God if God needed to put an egg back together he can put the egg back together if God can fix you he can fix a name is all right but there was a moment Moses did not know God's next move but by revelation right see that's what happens when you don't wing when God is getting ready to move in such a way he'll come in a way and you don't know whoa the light turns off a revelation strike you and it comes from God and now you know next what to do is that right hold your rod over there and all of a sudden God roll the waters bad if it had been a Pentecostal man he'd have been jumping glory to God hallelujah but Moses stood still he raised that word let me say it again he raised the word did you know the rod represented the world he raised the word and that's what you need to do you need to raise the word put it into a level that the word it stands higher than your battle or your flood right because even God caused that River he said it was a flood that's what it was hey many Karger to us so you said all brother what are you saying I want you understand that God has winked at our ignorance he's allowed us to go and do so many but let me say like this can't you not see in the spiritual realm what God is doing everything is being shaken and for the last few years God has been shaken what we call this message he's shaking everything y'all hear me that's why your lives are being shaken you've been shaking am I gonna stay with this message I'm I'm gonna stay with God or I'm gonna leave God have mercy on whom we will and you know what a lot of times we don't even understand what God is doing sometimes God will shake you to the place where you Baxley it or you do something you ain't got no business doing only to show you you're not where you should be and God will grant to repentance when time for repentance when you're ready for it you understand me listen Moses had to be feared not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you I can't do it but the Lord what was God doing proving himself to the people showing his acts to the people so that they could know him and sometimes that's what God does he does things but he don't want us to panic and get out of control he wants us to get up get in control of the situation have dominion over your trial notice of the mudras wherefore quiet down unto me speaking of the children of Israel that they go forward but lift down up that rod and stretch out down hand over the sea and divide it and the children Israel shall go on dry down sea we read that but we don't see the spectacular we don't see the rate the reality of what just took place we see it but we don't see it see and we don't understand how greatness is because we weren't there we read it in as I know we imagine it like Hollywood put it up there but the point is this is something that only God could have done and that's where God is with us sometimes he puts us in situation that only God can help you can do it he's the only one that can do it man can't do it you can't do it I can't do it only God can do it and God wants to do it but without faith it's impossible to please God now I'm a read this and I'm gonna be done I had to finish this evening but you know what it's it's amazing mm-hmm Jehoshaphat was uh in second chronicles you don't have to turn there but he was under a situation where Moab and some of the other tribal people were going to you know attack attack Israel and you know Joe hog the fattened you you know they were you know they were really scared because of the multitude but you know what David you know he wanted his Jeb is like land which was Jerusalem and and and and you know it's amazing how let me just read it and Judas stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children and upon jahaziel the son of Zechariah and the son of benaiah the son of GL and the son of Mantinea a Levite of the son of a SAP came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation thank God for this period of the Lord and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and doubt King Jehoshaphat thus said the Lord unto you be not afraid nor be dismayed by reason hmm is that word by reason of the great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods to go down against them in that right sometimes we think there is no way that this kid I don't know what I'm dealing with too many Devils say don't be this mate don't be this lady tomorrow go you down against them behold they come up the cliff of the Zeen and you should find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of Judea real and you should not need to fight in this battle search yourself stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you Oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you you don't have to fight it he's gonna fight it ministry experience you and I have the most blessed people on the face of the earth because we got him hello do you think he's stuck on that picture that's just that's just a reflection I've seen the pillar fire there were over 300 people in South Carolina seen the pillar of fire listen what brother mom says and Angel the Lord even his picture hanging here on the wall has God science stomped everywhere what does he do stay with me stay right with the word amen it cuts every devil yes it does what is it the ministering spirit sent from the presence of God to anoint the speakers of the word that stay with the word and he conforms the word with signs following but Jesus is saying yesterday today and forever there he is how could we doubt when he when he's both scientifically materially spiritually every way that can be proved he proved it here now what were you saying he has already proved himself to be with this message oh lord have mercy amen and what is the matter it's in our minds we open our minds to the thing say well now I don't know where they could be or not maybe if I feel better tomorrow oh that that don't have one thing to do with it see we open our minds we to doubtful things and and and and and remember every David I've got a script you know I go through that evening but David could not have been David had not there been an angel with him think about all other wise who did greatly Daniel Shadrach Meshach and Abednego it was angel or the angel of the Lord my point is the malli angel has come down with this message we have an angel but if we don't believe it if we don't use him amen but he's come to battle for us and the Bible said he put one foot on the sea and 109 and declared that time would be no more so you and I must understand we have come to as a manifested sons and daughters of God to prove that we are and that angel is here to vindicate the ministry that's what he's here for but God is creating himself we look at the statue of a perfect man and we fail to see that every one of those virtues are being tested right now every one of them and we're gonna either set in our minds we gonna conquer the land or we'll do like the bad spies we can't do it I can't live it that's what a lot of people when they left this message say it's too stiff it's too straight hallelujah I can't live it hallelujah no I can't live it you can't live it but if you get the Holy Ghost he will live it it is Christ in you the hope of glory it ain't about you eating about your strength and what you think you can do is God in yo who's living his life through you greater is he not me greater is He that's in me in you than he that is in the world but if you don't pray you won't stay you got to get before your knees and contact this Living God because he's here and he's waiting and won't to be contacted he's creating an army and the devil is doing everything he can and like like somebody said well you know I don't like saying he's a good adversary but he is kind of not so smart but he is he don't understand everything he does toward us really make us grow every little thing he try to bring us down just make us flourish he calls us that dead power to come we resurrection we're the resurrection we are the resurrection we cannot die we are the resurrection we're the resurrection of the of the church that failed after the day of Pentecost we are the resurrection and the only way that can be proven is that we must live the very life they lived with all of the signs and wonders following God is creating in you but first of all you got to have this mind you got to be willing to get rid of your own line how do you get rid of it the only thing I know is you got to give it to him he's not gonna take it unless you give it to him somewhere in your life you got to humble yourself and say god help me that's one of the things that I liked about meeting down there in South Carolina the brother said when you don't know what else to say you just say help with all your words your prayers and everything is you don't know what else to say to God all you could do is just get on your knees and say help me help me Lord help me help me help me and God knows every word in-between help you love the Lord can I get everybody right here to say help me that's it again help me let's say help me Lord so we can direct it help me Lord you that felt good didn't it let's say it again help me Lord see if you really say that and you really mean it you can stop the Sun because that's what blind bartimaeus did right he screamed and holiday it doesn't matter how many of us are crying help but he sees the sincere heart and when you really said see and you need to help he will come on the scene for let's stand yes yes yes and you and I must realize that he is a present help in a time of need you and I must need also know that you're not alone even though the devil make you feel that way let's say with the word he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you and that's what you need to preach back to the devil sisters if you ever wanted to preach preach back to the devil brothers preach back to the devil that's one thing you can do preach take that word of God and give it back to the devil a lot of things that we need to do as I said you know we must understand by God's grace that every day is a new day you can't go up offer you yesterday righteousness you may have been really strong and powerful yesterday but you don't that doesn't care don't carry on over give us this day our daily bread you must pray and ask God to cleanse you and wash you every day right throughout the day if you don't you'll find yourself sinking you love the Lord I love him ah because he first loved me and 400 trees tree I throw this at you when David won Jerusalem all the blind and the lame was destroyed all of the blind in the lane was destroyed and that's what God is doing right now in the spirit that's what he's doing those who don't repent and ask for sight and those who don't repent and ask for healing there's a spirit that will destroy you because no no nothing that would have filed a city wait enter father God we come before you lord as homeless we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you are battle-ax surely Lord when the news came to JoVE about all of his losses even when it came to losing all of his children it was a tough situation but Jobe kept its integrity when father even when his wife began to speak for the devil and he looked at her as his woman you don't sound like my wife kind of remind me of what you said to Peter Satan get behind me because a man Jobe knew his wife and he knew that his wife was being influenced by a bad spirit Lord we need you this morning give us wisdom Lord and insight to know the difference between the voice of Christ and the voice of the Antichrist help us now Lord Jesus that will not surrender Lord to the system of what this message had become but will stay with the Holy Spirit that pillar fire when all of Israel had turned their backs on the Prophet and the things that had heard of the Prophet they let pressure systems and things get next to them to where in that they bowed but may this little group of people never bow to an image anything that would be an abomination to you Lord may we press forward that we don't become worship of our sales or worshippers of our children you know that we we won't get into a place where you know we feel like we're so free and that's what Satan does he he offer freedom to the believer in reality it becomes bondage helpless now that we'll see how slick he is and how he maneuvers lured us and those of us who are in heavy battle give us the faith Lord to stare give us a revelation that will be that standard Lord that we won't bend bow break we won't compromise laws if it means that we got to go along we'll go along but lord give us that revelation to stand in this wicked hour help us now bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray to be to me like you
