service on Sunday and I trust that you're still feasting I'm glad to have my wife with us yeah my wife was not doing so well but I thank God for he's still Is A Healer we're not going to prolong the time let's just go straight to the scripture thank the Lord for the musicians song leader amen We Appreciate You amen uh such a mighty message mess the Lord did bless us this weekend and I trust that all of us still have that within our hearts knowing that this is deeper than we can imagine amen we appreciate the Lord Jesus and everything let us turn to Romans 12 and then from Romans 12 we'll go to Hebrews the 4th chapter Romans 122 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen amen Hebrews 4 and it reads begin at the first verse let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it amen For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not mix I mean excuse me word preach did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest amen as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from his works let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and all that you have done for us Lord we pray this evening your perfect and divine will be done forgive us of our sins and our trespasses cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord fill us and refill us with your Holy Ghost oh God bring these vessels that you have ordained unto life oh God to a perfect statue of Christ Lord God we are depending on you to see us through Lord thank you Father for the ictory that was one through your dear son Jesus Christ Hallelujah we celebrate the victory in Jesus Christ name we pray amen am you may be seated seeing that we have had such a word of Prophecy broken down to us in a way that some of us have never seen it before many times we have said before the foundation of the world we were in him and then God by and through his word gave us understanding on what that mean and it's amazing how God does things and he encourages us to not be conformed to this world the only way that we could ever be transformed is by the word of God and I want to say this evening many of us may not understand what conforming means but to conform means to behave to behave according to the usual standards of behavior that are expected by a group or society and it's so easy to become complacent it's so easy to fall in line with with the way everybody else behav but we will we must always remember we are not of this world we're not of this world we are from a different world as the scripture says though we be in the world we are not of the world Amen even brother brandham classifies us as a special class of people of people that have been ordained elected chosen by God hallelujah hallelujah and he has given us an expected endj Hallelujah and by the vision of Malachi 4 we now see what God's expected in is and that is to be in the very image and likeness of his dear son Jesus Christ there is only one God but remember I said God my multiplication you can multiply a thousand by one Hallelujah and all you going to get is one hallelujah or one by a thousand Hallelujah is that all right it describes it as a metamorphous to change in condition nature character convert amen so the word of God comes to change us hallelujah to transform us to change our appearance to change our Inner Man to change our nature to change our character that's what it means to be converted hallelujah amen amen and when you are converted you are changed the anger goes away the the the natural desires go away Hallelujah and Christ began to grow into you Hallelujah as the scripture says Romans 12 2 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind you heard what we said transformed by the renewing of your mind and as our brother said on last week when that birth take place on the inside when that when that Soul connects with the Eternal God the Mind amen transformed transferred amen into our mind there is a union his soul with our soul which makes us one Soul Hallelujah and then we have the mind of Christ hallelujah amen sir my message this evening his love is at work rest this is what we find so difficult to do rest we always feel like we've got to do something the only thing that Hebrews encourages us to do is to labor to enter into his rest the only laboring that we must do we must labor to receive that Holy Ghost Hallelujah is that right we must labor to enter into his rest and those of us who have entered into his rest we must recognize the faith that he told us that can move a mountain it's the same thing that can create a world and live on it Hallelujah the Same Love is a love that he will will keep all things in place and will not allow anything and to get out of order Hallelujah see the beauty of this life is knowing god and loving God eternally hallelujah hallelujah is that not right brother Rand said when perfect love is is ejected hallelujah amen Sovereign Grace is given is that right but you got you got to love God in order for God to respond yall understand what I'm saying when you love God God in in turn will respond Hallelujah so he puts us to the test love the Lord thy God with all your mind with all your soul with all your heart with all your being when you love God like that you cannot help but to see the supernatural moving in your life Hallelujah true am but because we were born with the nature of this world it would be wonderful if we could forget the old man hallelujah amen that but that but that is the problem we can't forget like God hallelujah no matter how holy no matter how Sanctified we become we still remember what the old man used to do and and that is the music that Satan loves to play back to us hallelujah but the Bible says if you resist the devil he will flee from you huj when the when Satan comes in you must resist him Hallelujah you must learn his voice you must learn his voice amen we know the voice of God but we need to learn his voice his voice will always come contrary to the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is that all right we must understand that the whole Bible is a love affair it's a love book hallelujah hallelujah but we also must understand our our faith must anchor in the word of God so much so this scripture becomes alive to you you say what scripture you you working with I'm working with Romans 8:28 the Bible says and we know that all things work together for good to them that what love God that's the key it works towards your good if you love God to them who are called according to his what purpose how many of y'all believe you call according to his purpose amen I believe that with all of my heart and we must learn to trust God under all circumstances Hallelujah trusting him proves to God that you love him hallelujah hallelujah second Corinthians 9 and8 Hallelujah we don't have to be so concerned Jesus said take no thought for tomorrow if he can feed the the sparrow he'll feed you Hallelujah if he can close the lily of the of the fields he can close you but we must believe that God is still Jehovah hallelujah hallelujah we're going through something everybody's going through something I don't no one family that's not being attacked by the devil Hallelujah but that's all right hallelujah hallelujah God is working see when the Devil comes at you you got to realize no matter what he tries to show you God is working Hallelujah and I'm going to rest on his promises Hallelujah no weapon formed against me no weapon formed against you shall prosper that is the word hallelujah no River can can drown you or overflow you no no fire can burn you Hallelujah you understand me some through the waters through the blood some through the fire but all through the blood Hallelujah we stand tonight as an invincible Army we came from God and we're going back to God nothing can stop this God is at work hallelujah hallelujah hallu the devil tried to tell you almost like God has deserted you God has deserted you but God has said how many of y'all believe I will never leave you nor will I forsake you I will always be with you even to the end of the age I believe that hallelujah hallelujah no matter what we go through we must know that God is working and everything he's doing is working for our good hallelujah hallelujah huj glory to God hallelujah hallelujah John 3 16-1 17 hallelujah hallelujah every day the devil strikes us with some negative thought Hallelujah trying to Cloud your mind and trying to confuse you every day Hallelujah but this is what the word of God says you keep your mind St on him he will give you what perfect Hallelujah it doesn't mean the storm wouldn't be rising Hallelujah but you'll be like that bird hiding in the Cliffs of the rock watching the storm as it goes by but in you there is peace Hallelujah you don't have to understand it just know that God is working Hallelujah the Devil comes in like a flood the Bible said he'll lift up a standard against him and what you need to do is exercise your lips exercise your words Hallelujah and tell the devil Hallelujah where he is where he's going Hallelujah and let him know ande that we are his God somebody help me here right you heard heard the brother you heard God when the devil tried to Temp Jesus and said I give you all of this he said Get Behind These sat Hallelujah Worship the Lord thy God and only hallelujah what what what when he said that where were you how was there Hallelujah I was in him Hallelujah glory to God oh yes sir that's why the Bible says greater is he that is in you he that is in the world Hallelujah hallu don't you let the devil get you all upet I don't care what it look like you tell the devil God is working hallelujah hallelujah yes sir we and he done brought me out before he bring me out again hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen amen St John 3 16-1 17 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish did y'all hear what I'm saying he that believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life Hallelujah for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved hallelujah hallelujah like the brother brought out the other day you are Mis wisdom Hallelujah you are Mis wisdom is that right that's what the Bible say there were five foolish and there were five wi Hallelujah is that right the wise vers she had allil in extra oil hallelujah what was that oil doing there Hallelujah understand a light a light shows you what's behind a light can show you what's in front of you and a light will show you you Hallelujah and this light in this day came to shine the light on the bride so she will come to know who she is and the prophet of God says when the Bride Comes to know who she is she will become an invisible Hallelujah not by power not by mind but by my spirit say the Lord hallelujah hallelujah thank God for the Holy Ghost thank God for the Holy Ghost God gives you the Holy Ghost the devil is finished Hallelujah the devil is finished h amen and if you know you got the Holy Ghost you know that you have been chained from the you used to be Hallelujah GLE up your your mind GLE up your mind girdle up your mind girle up your mind and be sober I I I I felt why so Hallelujah right put on the helpen of Faith y amen hallelujah hallelujah it's not this that you're counting on Hallelujah it is not even your spiritual is that soul man is what's in the soul Hallelujah huj and God has anchored his himself in my soul he's anchored himself in your soul Hallelujah and the grass with us the flow fade away but the word of the Lord SS are you the word are you the word are you the word hallelujah hallelujah fear not little flock it is a father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah when Satan triy to bring that fear on you you got to give it back to him you understand me when fear try to come on you you give it back to it you tell him I love the Lord hallelujah and guess what devil the lord loves me y'all hear what I'm saying not do I not only do I love him but the lord loves me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Ecclesiastes ecclesiast 123 to4 hallelujah hallelujah Glory to God you love God I don't mean to scream but I I got I got so much to scream about I got so much to scream about Hallelujah Ecclesiastes 12 13-4 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his commandment for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil Hallelujah and what wisdom will do what wisdom will do wisdom is going to keep God's Commandments Hallelujah now we think about God and and many of us have been in the message for a long time and it just seems like as we go along we're traveling we're journeying God still is unveiling himself this message is so powerful that that the Bible forever lives the the re ation of the word never ever stops and let me say this to you which was said to me the other day you cannot unlearn once you learn you can't unlearn you understand me once once a revelation strike you you can't get rid of it and it can't get rid of you it is a part of you from that moment on once it's quicker than you you and that Revelation becomes one that is some mystery of God because once you become one with the Revelation that Revelation then begins to transform into the reality of what it is somebody help me here hallelujah hallu glory to God Amen Romans 11th chapter 33 through the 36th verse hallelujah hallelujah glory to God it says oh death oh the oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who have known the mind of the Lord or who have been his counselor or who have first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever and ever hallelujah hallelujah Paul says in him I live in him I move and in him I have my being Hallelujah is that all right you see this is what the prophet of God has been trying to tell us to die completely out to until the only thing left of you is the H it's just the framework but on the inside God is in control he is so in control that you and God becomes one Hallelujah that's why the Bible said think it not robbery to be equal with God hallelujah it wasn't just referring to Jesus but it wasn't just referring to Jesus alone but all of his subjects all of his Brethren he is the first born of his kind Hallelujah as the brother said when brother BR was here he was God use him as a wave sheep Hallelujah that was Christ in that body y'all hear what I'm saying he was so yeld to the Holy Spirit when God would say something he would say it when God would do something he would do it and he didn't care about anybody he wasn't conformed to this world Hallelujah is that right when they tried to stop him from uh praying for this blind woman Hallelujah he was down south when there was segregation he wasn't conformed to the world hallelujah hallelujah he found his way to that woman Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying and you and I must cross all those kind of barriers Hallelujah we must cross every barrier we must cross through the Pentecostal barrier we must cross through the Baptist barrier you don't we don't care what you are Hallelujah God died for you he died for me Hallelujah and we are the bride of Christ is that right brother brandham describ it like this he said the bride is the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit hallelujah hallelujah that means the light that was in the blood is now in you and me Hallelujah this is why he calls us Kings and no matter how the Devil comes in if you afflict your body don't you worry about it God is still working the love of God is working Hallelujah pushing you into the place he desire you to be [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah things do happen but God had a what was the kind undisturbed faith Jesus had an undisturbed faith and he was trying to teach his disciples here he was in the bottom of the boat asleep disciples was with him they just came from a Revival Look what Jesus did Look what Jesus did he healed the sick he opened the eyes of the blood oh they had testimonies after testimony then here come the storm Hallelujah you ever notied that after you testify a storm comes in Hallelujah but you have the ability you have the power to bring peace to the storm is that all right because when they looked at Jesus they said car it not that we perish Jesus didn't get up confused and disoriented he got up like a man but he spoke like a God hallelujah is that right you might be a man with the hour but on the inside you are of God because he made you that not that you made yourself that he made you that that's the Bible We Are The Offspring of God you must believe that you are The Offspring of [Applause] God sometimes it song so hard to comprehend but we're not trying to comprehend what our head if he if he's in the temple he is saying amen hallelujah because God amens his word you think it's you saying amen but it's you and him United together Amen in his own word hallelujah glory to God hallelujah look what God does he does strange things that's why the Bible said his ways of pathf let's go to Genesis 29 please hallelujah hallelujah Genesis 29 now y'all know the the story of Jacob and you know I I love this particular scripture Jacob 29 and 20 the Bible said Jacob and Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her that is amazing hallelujah hallelujah and you know in that time Jacob worked yall know the story laan his father-in-law decided to trick him let's go to the let's go to the 21st verse and Jacob said unto Laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that I might go into her and Leen gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast and it came to pass the evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went into her Hallelujah you know Leah represents that old denomination hallelujah amen she was weak that that that's what the her name means weak and ody and frail fril Hallelujah she didn't she didn't have what it take even though she had more children hallelujah look at the promise brother bham said that Rachel was was was uh Jacob's real wife Hallelujah the promise was with her from the beginning and that's why she brought forth Joseph and Benjamin hallelujah amen y'all hear what I'm saying so and you look at all the other brothers they all were troubl y'all hear what I'm saying I'm saying all this things because we look and we read these stories but you don't know what Jacob what what he went through seven years Brothers more not seven months not a year seven years and seven more 14 years he waited for Rachel and can you imagine he's got two wives and Leah is forever having babies and Rachel who he really loves her womb is shut up Hallelujah so much so Rachel got so mad with Jacob I can see her grab him in his car why won't you give me a son and Jacob said do do I look like God hallelujah only God can make this thing happen y'all hear what I'm saying he had a rough time but he never backslid he still loved God and God was forever blessing him Hallelujah God blessed him so even during the time of his ating he was a he was a real Jew Hallelujah he was a SE to his heart Hallelujah but God still blessed him where do you think he got the idea about the spotted Cales spotted calves the sheep and the cows that were spotted where do you think he got that from there was no science lab God told him what to do Hallelujah even in his state of unconverted he wasn't converted but he had a seed I want you to understand that even when you was a sinner you know there times you should be dead but God protected the seed y understand me because he had a purpose for you and today we are now fulfilling your purpose Hallelujah huah oh the devil want to keep that Revelation from us hallelujah but he cannot stop it Hallelujah because this thing started before time began Hallelujah you understand what I'm saying we were in the mind of God as a seed and now we come to make it happen I'm not going to die until I make it happen I'm going to see it happen in my day I'm going to see it happen you going to see it happen in your day Hallelujah see what happened Jesus Christ is the yesterday today and forever Hallelujah I want to ask you where does he live hallelujah hallelujah is he in heaven no sir he's in you he's in you he's in you he's in me he's in us that's why they call him Jesus Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah see the devil don't understand he can't stop us from becoming Christ he can't stop us he's already made the promise Hallelujah is that right he said if you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive what the Holy Ghost and when you become the holy ghost or when the Holy Ghost becomes you amen you become Christ Hallelujah absolutely that's why the Bible says walk in the spirit Hallelujah cuz if you walk in the spirit you won't fill the lust of the flesh Hallelujah you won't be conformed to this world as long as you walking in the spirit and it came to pass that in the morning behold It was Leah and he said you know the Bible did everything but call her ugly can you imagine he's he was Rael beautiful and now the sun is come up and he looks over what a disappointment Hallelujah that man loved that woman y'all what I'm saying he loved Rachel hallelujah hallelujah even though it's it's father love let me tell you something one thing about it I believe I believe that Jacob understood he had had some payback coming he had been a Sher for some years stole stole his brother Birthright see what you read you so but he he still love God you understand me no matter what you go through throughout your disappointments you must still love God As Long As You Love Him He will always reveal himself to you he will respond those that love God they get extra Grace Grace abundance abounding Grace Hallelujah yes Lord and it came to pass that in the morning behold It was Leah and he said unto La I can almost hear him laying in the tent waking up seeing Le and I can hear upset Hallelujah but he he already made y'all hear I'm saying he said what is this that thou has done unto me did not I serve with thee for Rachel wherefore then has thou begal me but see what people don't understand even denominational Christians belongs to God hallelujah hallelujah and laan said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the first born you understand me so we come at the end our older sister Leah you know what I'm saying they have more children than we have Glory but we

first born fulfill her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shall serve with me yet seven other years and I'm going say seven other Church ages amen God comes alone Hallelujah and he said I'm going you mine I already sealed you with the kiss yes Hallelujah and Jacob said did and Jacob did soob and fulfilled his weak and he gave Rachel his daughter to his to wife also Hallelujah and you know Rachel the name means you a female sheep yeah come on somebody God is good to us God leadership is always strange and peculiar always strange and peculiar hallelujah hallelujah in the message Divine love and Sovereign Grace paragraph 30 the prophet says how the path of God leads some through the water some through the flood some through great trials but all through the blood God leads his children strange peculiar ways but God works in mysterious ways his wonders to be if he had to be mysterious or he couldn't perform the Wonders y'all hear what I'm saying he sets us up so that we can see see the his wonders y'all hear what I'm saying you look at look at look now God could have called Paul he could say Paul you one of my disciples even when he knew Judas was going to betray him he could have called but he didn't and then when Judas betrayed it the disciples thought we're going to you know set up another office another apostle Mias and Mias did nothing because that was not his place Hallelujah but God called Saul look what God did he works in Peculiar ways sa is going down to persecute the Christians Hallelujah on his way to Damascus is that right then the light shine from Heaven he fell from his horse what a way to introduce yourself hallelujah what way sometime it takes hardships to bring people to Christ Hallelujah sometimes Supernatural things must happen in order to bring people to Christ but however he chooses to do it we get the point and and according to history Saul had the issue with his eyes that's what he called a thorn in his flesh God left it there Hallelujah left his eyes in a condition so he would never forget Hallelujah sometimes God allow things to happen to us naturally in a way so we can never forget and we'll keep praying like Paul Paul said Lord let this thing pass from me and guess what God said to him my grace is sufficient Hallelujah huj he did the same thing to our Prophet Hallelujah he had a condition in his stomach almost all his life prayed for sick the eyes of the blind were open de people were raain [Applause] walked was healed but he had this condition he couldn't get rid of and the doctor said one day it was going to cause his death Hallelujah but God kept him he kept him on his knees y understand me it was the tool that God was using to keep my brother humble Hallelujah it was the same kind of thing God let on Paul to keep him what humble hallelujah oh somebody help me here and God did the same thing but when his ministry was almost over Hallelujah and he saw that seventh dve it was all over Hallelujah that same little square creature among the Thorns Hallelujah glory to God see we got to always give thanks you must realize God is working his love is working on your behalf he he we don't have to ask the question why me Lord we know why we must go through these things hallelujah hallelujah is that right let's move on skip that okay yeah okay no no let me just go ahead and read this quickly for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love rooted and grounded where in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breath the length and the depth and height so this is vastness this is this is vastness you know you you you you've heard people say man that was just mindblowing mean that it's beyond it's beyond and it has had such an effect on me that I'm not just a Christian hoping to be saved I'm secure we are secure Hallelujah glory to God may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breath and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ I got a scripture for you and to know the love of Christ it's good to know the love of Christ cuz when you know the love of Christ you're going to know that he's going to chasen you you know he's going to correct you whenever you need correcting he's going to correct you Hallelujah that is the love of Christ I got a scripture with p's knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God hallelujah hallelujah let me skip that let's go to Revelation 3 19 I'mma close in just a minute a few don't I won't be too much longer Revelations 3 listen to this this should jump up out of out of the scripture on you as many as I love yes do you hear that he doesn't chasen everybody he doesn't rebuke everybody as many as I love Jesus Christ loving us oh my God you got to understand what I'm saying I'm going to say it again as many as I love it is so personalized I rebuke and chasen be therefore and repent but I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice open the door I will come into him and will sh with him and he with me that is a promise as many as I love y hear me I can say yes Jesus Lov me now with a different anointing with a different understanding Hallelujah y'all hear me no matter what we go through if I am rebuked if I am chasen Hallelujah if I am corrected I know why he's doing it Hallelujah he's not my enemy he is my God he is my lover is my soulmate Hallelujah he is handling [Music] me look what brother says as many as I love I rebuke and chasen beel is therefore repent Revelation 3:19 this is the same message that John had as he cried out in that religious Wilderness of phares Sadducees heathens repent there was no other course then there is no other other course now there was no other way to get back to God then and there is no other way to get back now it is repent change your mind turn around repent for why will you die Hallelujah y he said let us examine the first phrase as many as I love in the Greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun he does not say as many would feel he should say he does not say as many would feel he would should say yeah as many as love me no sir no sir he doesn't say that we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of God is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves glorying in his salvation purpose and his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of God even as he said in Romans 9 Jacob have a love does it not obtain that since he loved only the many is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn not him by no means is this so yall understand what he's saying he's basically saying that even when you don't love him he love you it is his love that's drawing you it's his love that's changing you Hallelujah and he knows down the road you going to love him like he loves you hallelujah hallelujah yes he said by no means is this so for he declared as also in Romans 913 Esau have I hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born hey somebody neither neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand Hallelujah and if you are elected you might not know the love of God but because he loves you he's going to he's going to correct you and he's going to draw you no man comes to the father or to the son the father draws him and often time he draws us because of catastrophes storms or battles something happens in your life that makes you look up yall understand me it's like the prodal son he got tired of the world he but he knew that his his father was a king Hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying amen at the end end of his Road he found himself wanting to eat the food with the pigs but something came to him something was quickened to him I've got a father he is a king I am a King's son and if I've got to go back home just to be a servant I'm going to be that so let me say it like this don't you know God knows the end of the story when you can't see your way through God is the alpha he's the Omega he's the beginning he's the ending and everything work together for the [Applause] good hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah see right and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to ele might stand not of works but of him that call it it didn't say by him but him that calls call it he keeps calling Hallelujah he keeps calling he keeps drawing he keeps pulling Hallelujah there's no turning around this love is elective love it is a love for his elect and his love from them is a part from Human marriage for it says that the purpose of God stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself you can't marry God you can't even love God enough it's his election that brings you to heaven it's your his election his predestination y understand what I'm saying he paid the price the price is paid you understand me not the power not the mind but by my spirit said the Lord hallelujah what are you saying brother Brooks as long as I love him I trust him Hallelujah see what I'm saying whatever you go through Jesus already know and if you can believe that that everything is working for your good hallelujah hallelujah what is he doing he's building character don't run from the battle don't run from the battle hallelujah it's not yours the battle is of the Lord he will fight every battle you just need to learn how to stand still Hallelujah you must learn how to stand still hallelujah hallelujah yes sir he said before the children were born he had already said Jacob have I love but Esau have I hated can I finish and now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and Chas him Hallelujah now don't you know reuk and Chas him seem quite sweet right now his rebuke and his chasing sounds real sweet right now because I know that my dad my father is rebuking and chasing me to correct to make sure I don't be conformed but transformed hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to is that right to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view of Correction chasing doesn't not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject amendment is in the mind this is exactly what we find in Hebrews 12 5 through 11 I'm almost done and ye have forgotten exaltation which speaketh unto you as children my son despise not thou the chasing of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him whom the Lord loveth he chasen it scores every son whom he receiveth you understand me he doing this because he's received you if you endure chastening God dealth with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father chasen not but if ye be without chastisement where of are all partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which correct us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in the subjection unto the father of spirit and live for verely for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partaker of his what Holiness now the chasing now the chastening for the present seem to be joyous now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous griev nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby y'all remember when you got a good beaten oh that was the best sleep ever you go to sleep I'm telling you hallelujah hallelujah I'mma finish this paragraph and then I'm going let you go I want you to know his love is working and it's working for you don't think it's just the opposite the devil want you to think oh you so sinful that's why you're going through all these trials and keep your mind on [Music] Jesus keep your affection on things above that's what he's saying right when he smack your hand don't touch that yall understand me he's trying to keep you from being hurt okay this is my last paragraph herein Now set forth the love of God he desire in love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself there before him lies all kind mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto this the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen on born of a spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all long suffering he reproves with all long suffering and gentleness and mercy how many times and I'm I'm I'm Lord I ain't going to do it again and then we end up doing what doing it again but he's longsuffering that's what it is hallelujah hallelujah but you know what God loveed that repentant heart he love to hear a person from the heart say God you know I didn't mean to do it all Lord I didn't intend to do it all Lord help me not do that again Hallelujah but see God knows when you've given everything up so he don't allow you to be deceived when you don't give it all up it Springs up again Hallelujah is this okay he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chasing with nail scarred hands sometimes his sometime this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desire but it is love can it's love that is his love another way of Love there is not there cannot be there is no other way that's the way of love you love the Lord let's just close with this Hallelujah there's more to it but I'm just going to let uh close with this but I just want to say you know we have so many lessons to learn a lot of lessons to learn but in all you do the Bible said a just men falls seven times in a day and get it ain't the fall that he's looking at brother said we came into this world as failures he said we were failures to begin with Hallelujah and we only become Victorious through Jesus Christ Our Lord I there's so many things this message holds and and in my mind you know I I can see it but it's here I need it to be manifest not just in my head in my heart CU I know one he has control there we become walking and talking Bibles we become living Epistles written R of all men let's stand thank you Lord you know God will let you go through a dry spell and the devil say see you you you you dead you man where's that anointing you used to have maybe you were laid off by worldly thoughts and ideas but God ain't through with you yet look at Samson he brought disgrace to the name of Jehovah [Music] but Samson knew there was always that possibility that God would have him back Hallelujah as you've heard me say many times don't give up on God because God won't give up on you and when I see in my mind all the things that Samson did and yet Samson could not die until he had fulfilled his purpose and the Bible said Samson killed more Philistines in his death that's all I'm saying we're We Are Spiritual Beings we are in an evil world enemy is the devil but don't run from him you got to face your giant and know that God is still a giant killer and you got to believe that no matter what maybe God wants you to pray more maybe he wants you to study more fast I don't know but I can tell you what wherever he wants you to be he's going to find he's going to make sure you find that place that you have to be uh uh uh Jacob thought he was going for one wife but in the mind of God he had two come back with all those blessings it's so amazing God did the same thing to Abraham Abraham thought he was doing his own man but God led him allowed him to go to Egypt is that right and then here's the king looking at his wife Abraham's wife Sarah want to marry her Hallelujah then God we see something in Abraham we didn't even know was there AB Abra said tell them you're my sister you understand me God didn't curse Abraham matter of fact God cursed the king almost if the king had to ask Abraham to pray for him y'all hear what I'm saying so let me say it like this when anybody trespass You When anybody do evil to you you better pray for them because if you don't pray for them bad things are going to happen I've seen it and I I know every Christian I've seen people there people in they great right now because of the way they treated the Servants of God and you're precious before God and understand you're the upper you're not you're not the tail you're the head let's pray our gracious father we come to you as humble as we know how Lord I I thank you for your mercy and your grace I thank you for this identification you have given all of us to know that it was your choose and it was your love and because you love us we can love you oh God we thank you for your Mighty
