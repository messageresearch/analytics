[51:26] out their lives as symbols
[51:30] and what they experienced in the natural
[51:35] shows a type of what we experience
[51:37] spiritually
[51:41] Israel is a type of the believer Israel
[51:46] and they were called out of Egypt
[51:50] a type of being called out of the world
[51:55] Amen they heard a message of a prophet
[52:00] amen that called them out
[52:03] said come out of her my people
[52:06] amen be not partakers of her
[52:29] Amen to receive salvation
[52:33] amen amen but then he took them in
[52:37] somewhere Elizabeth
[52:39] amen the whole purpose of bringing them
[52:42] out of Egypt
[52:45] it wasn't so that they could wander in
[52:47] the wilderness
[52:49] it was so that they could go into the
[52:52] land that God had promised us
[52:58] and that land is a type of the Holy
[53:01] Ghost it's experience
[53:05] it's a type of a spirit-led life see
[53:11] living by the Holy Spirit
[53:16] amen because in that land they trusted
[53:19] God
[53:21] Amen in that land they didn't they they
[53:25] didn't have the great benefits of a
[53:28] river like they did in Egypt
[53:33] in Egypt they lived by the Nile River
[53:38] and because of that River they had great
[53:41] wealth
[53:43] they were able to grow crops
[53:47] they invented great forms of irrigation
[53:51] using the river
[53:55] it was all because of their intellect
[53:59] and and men's devices
[54:03] but in the promised land they didn't
[54:05] have that
[54:07] in the promised land they had to rely on
[54:11] the rain from Heaven
[54:14] they had their rely on God supplying the
[54:18] rain just when they needed it for their
[54:20] crops
[54:24] and it's a type of a life led by the
[54:28] spirit of God
[54:31] no longer are they walking based on
[54:33] their own understanding and intellect
[54:38] but in this promised land they would be
[54:41] walking by the spirit
[54:45] so that's what God intended for them
[54:50] amen and they were coming up to that
[54:54] they were coming up to a place called
[54:59] amen and they were coming to a decision
[55:04] a showdown
[55:07] amen and we have many times like that in
[55:10] our lives
[55:13] and the decision that they were going to
[55:15] make
[55:17] was going to affect Generations after
[55:21] them
[55:23] amen it was an important decision
[55:27] and sometimes in our lives we have those
[55:30] times when we have to make a choice
[55:34] amen things are building and building up
[55:37] to a place
[55:40] whether you're going to accept God's
[55:42] word or not
[55:45] the decision that you make will affect
[55:48] your children and your children's
[55:50] children
[55:54] every time we come to church
[55:57] every time we hear the word of God
[56:02] we have a choice
[56:04] we come to this place
[56:07] where we make a decision
[56:10] am I going to accept it or reject it
[56:21] because too many times people say yes I
[56:26] believe it that's God's word
[56:29] amen the word in church
[56:32] and then they won't walk in it after
[56:34] church
[56:39] amen
[56:40] Eve came to that point in the Garden of
[56:43] Eden
[56:45] that's God's word
[56:47] and Satan came to tempt her
[56:51] and gave her a perverted form of the
[56:54] word
[56:57] only changed one little part
[57:01] and she had a choice
[57:03] do I walk and stay with the simple word
[57:07] that God has given me
[57:10] amen or am I going to go with my
[57:13] reasoning
[57:15] amen am I going to let the devil talk to
[57:18] my mind
[57:21] and question the word
[57:24] and of course we know what she chose
[57:28] and we know the consequences
[57:32] amen amen Jesus had a showdown
[57:36] amen he was in The Garden of Gethsemane
[57:40] and he said Lord not my will
[57:46] so he had a will
[57:48] he had a choice
[57:51] amen amen but he surrendered his will
[57:57] but he didn't have to
[58:00] he had a choice
[58:02] amen his whole Ministry built up to that
[58:06] Showdown
[58:09] the final point
[58:12] where Victory would be won or lost
[58:17] amen and he laid down his will
[58:22] and he said Lord thy will be
[58:26] amen we brother sister will not get by
[58:29] with anything less
[58:32] amen we come to the place
[58:36] where we have to surrender our will
[58:40] because we've been given a choice
[58:44] amen Amen brother Brandon called it free
[58:47] moral agency amen
[58:51] a place where we can make a choice
[58:55] and the choice that we make determines
[58:58] our Eternal destinations
[59:03] so this is the type of decision that
[59:06] Israel is up to is is going to make
[59:11] they were on the very doorstep of
[59:14] receiving their promise amen
[59:19] a promise that God had made to their
[59:22] forefather Abraham
[59:25] when he called him out all those many
[59:27] years ago
[59:29] he showed him the land that he was going
[59:32] to give to him
[59:35] but now his children
[59:38] his descendants
[59:40] we're being told to go walk in the
[59:43] promise
[59:46] amen it wasn't enough just to say yes
[59:49] we're the children of Abraham
[59:51] we have a problem
[59:53] they it was their time to walk in the
[59:57] promise
[59:58] oh brother sister we've been given so
[1:00:01] much
[1:00:02] amen we've received so much words
[1:00:06] amen but we've got to walk in it
[1:00:09] amen we've got to cross over
[1:00:13] and walk in that land
[1:00:16] amen amen
[1:00:19] so knowing that that that this they had
[1:00:24] they had come out of slavery in Egypt
[1:00:29] where they didn't have a choice
[1:00:32] now they had a choice amen
[1:00:37] and they had come out under many mighty
[1:00:40] Miracles
[1:00:43] they saw the power of God on display
[1:00:48] right they saw Moses doing Miracles
[1:00:56] their prophet of the day
[1:01:00] amen he was he was showing them that God
[1:01:04] was on the scene
[1:01:08] things that they had heard in the past
[1:01:11] that Jehovah had done for Abraham and
[1:01:15] Isaac
[1:01:17] was now coming to life again
[1:01:20] no God was real
[1:01:23] and that his promises are true
[1:01:28] amen amen so they came out of that
[1:01:31] slavery and rejoice
[1:01:35] think about this
[1:01:38] their daily bread was Miracles
[1:01:42] amen every day
[1:01:47] they receive their daily bread
[1:01:51] they saw powerful armies defeated
[1:01:56] Pharaoh's Army destroyed
[1:02:00] they had a cloud and a pillar Affairs
[1:02:08] amen I I'm saying this because I want
[1:02:11] you to understand this was a powerful
[1:02:13] move foreign
[1:02:22] amen they hadn't even received the
[1:02:25] promise yet
[1:02:27] but yet they were part of a powerful
[1:02:30] move of God
[1:02:34] amen amen
[1:02:36] you see Jesus
[1:02:38] when he was going around walking as a
[1:02:42] man
[1:02:44] he preached and talked about casting out
[1:02:46] demons
[1:02:49] and he talked about the power of God
[1:02:52] but he said this was he said if you cast
[1:02:57] out a spirit
[1:02:59] that spirit will go and it'll walk in
[1:03:01] dry places
[1:03:04] right and then it will come back to the
[1:03:07] person
[1:03:09] and and finding the house swept and
[1:03:12] cleaned
[1:03:14] right he'll come back with some of his
[1:03:16] buddies
[1:03:18] and the state of that person will be
[1:03:20] worse than it was at the beginning
[1:03:24] why because nothing came to fill that
[1:03:27] person
[1:03:30] the demon was cast out
[1:03:33] but I want you to see that there's power
[1:03:38] amen even before the spirit or the
[1:03:41] promise comes
[1:03:45] coming out of bondage
[1:03:49] amen there's power in that yeah
[1:03:52] coming out of Egypt forth from demon
[1:03:56] powers
[1:03:58] is powerful
[1:04:01] amen amen Jesus said you shall receive
[1:04:05] power from on high
[1:04:08] after the Holy Spirit has come upon him
[1:04:12] so they had power before
[1:04:15] they cast out demons
[1:04:23] but then Jesus said you'll have power
[1:04:25] after the holy spirit
[1:04:30] so what power was he talking about
[1:04:35] good question they already had the power
[1:04:38] to do all those things
[1:04:40] so what was the power
[1:04:43] it was the power to live in the spirit
[1:04:48] amen to walk in the word
[1:04:54] amen amen Abraham was promised that they
[1:04:58] would have a land of rest
[1:05:01] the power of the spirit is walking in
[1:05:04] rest
[1:05:07] though the world is falling apart around
[1:05:10] you
[1:05:12] the power of the spirit is walking in
[1:05:15] peace
[1:05:16] amen no matter what the circumstances
[1:05:19] are
[1:05:20] amen that's power
[1:05:23] beyond just casting out demons
[1:05:26] amen it's power to give the word Life
[1:05:32] to Live Like Jesus
[1:05:35] amen so that promised land is a symbol
[1:05:39] of that power
[1:05:42] Amen brother random said this and I
[1:05:45] won't quote it but it's this is
[1:05:48] just paraphrasing he said that the
[1:05:51] promised land
[1:05:53] is God's promise to the church
[1:05:57] to live in the power of the spirit
[1:06:03] amen amen not being pulled by any wind
[1:06:07] of Doctrine
[1:06:09] am I not being pulled by the world
[1:06:14] no longer relying on the flesh
[1:06:18] no longer relying on our own strength
[1:06:22] amen but living in the power of the
[1:06:25] spirit
[1:06:27] amen we we enter in and we stop
[1:06:30] wandering around
[1:06:34] we stop looking for God
[1:06:39] because we're walking with him
[1:06:42] amen we've met him personally when we
[1:06:45] enter that land
[1:06:48] amen and he places Us in that land
[1:06:52] he settles us down
[1:06:55] amen and and we're not we're not running
[1:06:58] from this place to that place anymore
[1:07:02] but he shows us what
[1:07:06] amen he shows us our place in the
[1:07:09] kingdom of God
[1:07:12] he places Us in the body of Christ
[1:07:16] amen and we have a peace and we're
[1:07:19] settless amen
[1:07:25] all of this was waiting for them
[1:07:31] hallelujah amen but they had to choose
[1:07:36] none of them had ever seen it
[1:07:40] not even Moses
[1:07:44] he hadn't crossed over
[1:07:48] he hadn't seen it with his own eyes
[1:07:52] he was allowed to go up on the mountain
[1:07:54] and look across
[1:07:59] but he didn't get to set foot in that
[1:08:01] land
[1:08:02] and so he was just telling them about it
[1:08:06] none of them knew
[1:08:09] amen but he was giving them the word of
[1:08:12] God
[1:08:13] and telling them about what was their
[1:08:16] promise
[1:08:19] so they had to walk by faith
[1:08:22] amen amen they had to trust that word
[1:08:28] to walk into their promise
[1:08:31] so they came to the Border
[1:08:35] and that border the Border was the
[1:08:38] Jordan River
[1:08:42] right and that river is a symbol of
[1:08:45] death is
[1:08:48] crossing over
[1:08:50] you leave the old behind
[1:08:58] so in this case it's death to yourself
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:07] it's not you dying physically
[1:09:10] but it's an old man dying and a new man
[1:09:13] being reborn
[1:09:18] and that's what they were facing fast
[1:09:22] and they had to decide is it worth it to
[1:09:24] go across the excuse me
[1:09:27] amen is it worth dying
[1:09:31] to everything that that I've wanted and
[1:09:35] dreamed about
[1:09:39] amen is it is it worth letting my dreams
[1:09:42] fall to the floor
[1:09:46] maybe everything I wanted as a man in
[1:09:48] life
[1:09:54] am I willing to give it all to God
[1:09:59] die out to my own ideas
[1:10:03] amen lay myself on the altar
[1:10:08] give myself completely to him
[1:10:13] it was just a crossover
[1:10:18] Nature has to die is it not true amen
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:36] it's a sacrifice
[1:10:40] so they came to that Choice
[1:10:44] the pillar have fire had led them to
[1:10:48] that point
[1:10:50] and then he was waiting to
[1:10:53] think they would do I mean
[1:10:56] you see I'm sure they can follow that
[1:10:59] Pillar of Fire all through the
[1:11:01] Wilderness
[1:11:03] but he only brings them up to the choice
[1:11:09] it's up to you
[1:11:11] amen we can preach about it all we want
[1:11:16] amen and we can we can lead you to the
[1:11:20] truth
[1:11:21] but every individual person
[1:11:26] amen must cross over on their own
[1:11:29] they must choose to die out yourself
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:36] they must choose to allow that old sin
[1:11:40] nature to be killed
[1:11:43] um
[1:11:46] to cross over into that land
[1:11:50] so they had no evidence
[1:11:54] but they had some witnesses
[1:11:57] and they chose these Witnesses
[1:12:00] and you know they they chose the the
[1:12:03] best men among them
[1:12:05] amen amen God always has Witnesses
[1:12:11] amen so God LED Moses
[1:12:15] to send some men to spy out the land is
[1:12:20] and he gave them two tasks
[1:12:24] one check the land
[1:12:28] so look at the soil and the water
[1:12:33] man look at what is produced there
[1:12:37] and number two
[1:12:40] check out the inhabitants
[1:12:43] right what people are there
[1:12:46] are they in the cities or in the
[1:12:49] countryside
[1:12:51] what are we up against
[1:12:54] amen that's what he told those witnesses
[1:13:00] that was their job now they knew the
[1:13:04] word of God right
[1:13:08] oh what an honor to be chosen for that
[1:13:10] task
[1:13:12] they would be the first one to lay eyes
[1:13:16] on the promised land
[1:13:20] amen amen they weren't to take
[1:13:23] possession of it yet
[1:13:27] but they were to experience it
[1:13:30] and to Bear witness of what they saw
[1:13:35] amen amen hallelujah amen
[1:13:39] Witnesses
[1:13:43] they were to speak to the others
[1:13:47] about the promise
[1:13:51] and and tell them what what they saw
[1:13:55] what the experience amen
[1:14:01] and brother sister every believer is
[1:14:03] called To Be A Witness
[1:14:09] we are to take the promises of God
[1:14:13] and experience them
[1:14:18] amen and then tell others
[1:14:20] I know God is real
[1:14:23] well how do you know
[1:14:26] because I've experienced
[1:14:29] I know him
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:32] he speaks to me
[1:14:35] I know he's a Healer how do you know
[1:14:38] he's a Healer because he healed me
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:43] that promise has been made alive to me
[1:14:48] amen and I'm a witness that it's true
[1:14:52] I'm not just speaking about someone
[1:14:55] else's experience
[1:14:57] but a witness is someone who has
[1:15:00] first-hand experience amen
[1:15:06] tell us about this God that you know
[1:15:12] but brother sister there's too many
[1:15:15] people
[1:15:16] amen that claim to have an experience
[1:15:22] amen they claim to speak for God if
[1:15:30] but they haven't crossed over
[1:15:34] they're just speaking about a promise
[1:15:38] amen but they've never met him
[1:15:41] themselves
[1:15:42] you can't talk about that land
[1:15:45] unless you've experienced amen
[1:15:51] too many standing on the other side
[1:15:54] speaking about that land over there
[1:15:59] amen instead of living in the land and
[1:16:02] saying listen man I'm living it is
[1:16:08] so these Witnesses were supposed to
[1:16:11] bring back this report
[1:16:14] and come back and tell the people how
[1:16:18] the promise is real
[1:16:24] and I imagine when they came back the
[1:16:26] people were excited
[1:16:29] amen what's it like
[1:16:32] all that we've heard
[1:16:35] are the prophecies true
[1:16:38] tell us what you saw
[1:16:43] they went to spy out the land for 40
[1:16:45] days
[1:16:49] people waited for 40 days
[1:16:54] waiting for their testimony amen
[1:16:59] what they would testify is really
[1:17:02] important right amen
[1:17:06] and there's a lot riding on your
[1:17:09] testimony too
[1:17:11] amen you represent him
[1:17:16] amen amen if somebody hasn't experienced
[1:17:20] the goodness of God
[1:17:23] if they haven't experienced the power of
[1:17:26] the Holy ghosts
[1:17:29] those that have are the only proof
[1:17:35] and their testimony is important
[1:17:39] they represent him amen amen
[1:17:43] so they wait in anticipation
[1:17:48] a generation of people
[1:17:51] for years they've longed to be in the
[1:17:54] land
[1:17:56] remember great grandpa spoke about it
[1:18:04] and here we are right on the the very
[1:18:07] border of it amen
[1:18:12] waiting to cross over
[1:18:17] hallelujah hallelujah and finally the
[1:18:19] spy's return
[1:18:21] and they begin to give their reports
[1:18:24] amen
[1:18:29] and now you meant to know they're going
[1:18:32] to have two choices
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:39] we're always given two choices
[1:18:42] because brother sister if you don't have
[1:18:45] two two choices
[1:18:47] then there are there's no choice
[1:18:50] if you only have one choice that's not a
[1:18:54] choice
[1:18:56] right God God had to allow the LIE
[1:19:02] so we could choose the truth
[1:19:09] so now they're going to have a choice
[1:19:16] the spies admitted the land is good this
[1:19:19] is
[1:19:21] amen they all they all Testify
[1:19:25] the land is good
[1:19:27] like God said it's a good land flowing
[1:19:30] with milk and honey amen
[1:19:34] but man
[1:19:38] amen amen but me there's trials
[1:19:44] there's things there that I don't think
[1:19:46] we can overcome yeah amen
[1:19:53] it's gonna be hard I I don't see how we
[1:19:56] can do it there's Giants amen
[1:20:01] now they were testifying mostly truth
[1:20:08] the land's flowing with milk and honey
[1:20:12] the promise is true what God said it's
[1:20:17] all there
[1:20:19] and there are giants there true
[1:20:25] there's trials there's things to
[1:20:28] overcome yeah there's a battle to be
[1:20:30] fought yeah
[1:20:32] all true
[1:20:35] but then you hear Satan's voice
[1:20:40] starting to enter in
[1:20:42] now there was ten against two yeah
[1:20:48] brother sister that just seems like it's
[1:20:50] always the way
[1:20:52] Satan's voice is loud
[1:20:58] sometimes he likes to shout
[1:21:02] amen and when you're in a trial
[1:21:07] let's take sickness
[1:21:11] your symptoms are shouting at you
[1:21:15] amen the word of God is speaking that
[1:21:18] God is your healer
[1:21:21] but the symptoms seem to shout the
[1:21:24] loudest
[1:21:28] maybe I'm the only one
[1:21:30] amen it seems like the devil's always
[1:21:33] shouting
[1:21:35] amen the perversion of the word is the
[1:21:38] loudest voice
[1:21:40] so whose report do you believe
[1:21:44] amen wow
[1:21:47] are you gonna believe the the ten
[1:21:51] or the two
[1:21:54] so the ten said yes it's beautiful
[1:21:58] it's wonderful
[1:22:00] but we can't take it
[1:22:05] hey man
[1:22:07] amen just one little change
[1:22:10] it's all true but it's too hard we can't
[1:22:14] do it we can't take it and of course you
[1:22:17] know the story Joshua Caleb they stood
[1:22:20] up and they said
[1:22:21] let's go I don't see why are we even
[1:22:24] waiting here
[1:22:26] God has given it to us
[1:22:29] they said let us go at once and take the
[1:22:33] land yeah
[1:22:35] and he said what about the Giants
[1:22:38] God gave us that land
[1:22:41] it belongs to us it doesn't belong to
[1:22:45] the Giants
[1:22:47] amen amen
[1:22:49] can I read you some things from the
[1:22:51] message
[1:22:53] just for a moment here I'd like to just
[1:22:55] one more morning to read a couple I'll
[1:22:57] have them here so you can look at it if
[1:22:59] you want okay
[1:23:02] so Moses this is from questions and
[1:23:04] answers
[1:23:07] Moses said to the ten tribes he'd send a
[1:23:10] man out of each tribe to go represent
[1:23:12] and spy out the land to see what kind of
[1:23:14] condition it was in um
[1:23:26] now if that isn't exactly up to your
[1:23:30] place this morning
[1:23:34] where you come
[1:23:37] today the church has come through
[1:23:39] justification through Luther this is
[1:23:44] sanctification through the Methodist
[1:23:47] and now up to the time of the promise
[1:23:51] the promise is the baptism of the spirit
[1:23:55] which is Promised all through the Old
[1:23:58] Testament and the new too
[1:24:01] it says he said the promised land is to
[1:24:05] live in this land of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:12] that's God's promise for the church
[1:24:17] amen that's his promise for you this
[1:24:19] morning
[1:24:20] is to live in the power of the spirit
[1:24:26] free it's another world
[1:24:29] it's another land not be you have to
[1:24:33] come out of the conditions that you've
[1:24:34] been in
[1:24:36] come out to live in this promised land
[1:24:39] to receive the promise
[1:24:43] amen amen to receive that promise
[1:24:50] amen amen
[1:24:54] the spies said and I'm just going to
[1:24:56] paraphrase these scriptures
[1:25:00] he said surely that land flows with milk
[1:25:03] and honey
[1:25:07] but the people are strong that dwell in
[1:25:10] the land
[1:25:12] man they're world cities they're
[1:25:15] fortified
[1:25:17] amen amen
[1:25:19] it's gonna be hard do you
[1:25:23] see
[1:25:25] you're gonna have to bear a reproach
[1:25:27] amen
[1:25:32] you're gonna have to die out
[1:25:36] you're gonna have to leave behind your
[1:25:38] old ideas
[1:25:41] now I'm gonna bring this home a little
[1:25:43] bit here this morning
[1:25:45] because brother sister
[1:25:49] many in our own message
[1:25:52] are sitting at the border
[1:25:57] they've followed this message their
[1:25:59] entire lives
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:04] and haven't crossed over
[1:26:07] maybe they never heard it preached maybe
[1:26:11] they've never surrendered
[1:26:15] but many many sit at the border
[1:26:20] and they're in the message
[1:26:23] following the message of the prophets
[1:26:25] amen
[1:26:30] hey man sit on a message Pew listen to
[1:26:33] the tapes
[1:26:35] but never crossed over
[1:26:38] you can have all the I call the
[1:26:42] trappings but all the things of the
[1:26:44] message
[1:26:46] know all the language

[1:26:54] come out of the world
[1:26:57] been Sanctified
[1:26:59] amen amen living a Sanctified life
[1:27:04] but not crossed over yet
[1:27:08] not living in the spirit
[1:27:11] amen and those Believers
[1:27:15] that are in that conditions
[1:27:19] amen they're missing that life
[1:27:25] amen
[1:27:26] amen hallelujah
[1:27:31] now we we went through this at our own
[1:27:34] home church
[1:27:35] we had many young people
[1:27:42] but there's just as many older people
[1:27:47] they admit I've never been baptized in
[1:27:51] the spirit
[1:27:54] now I was raised in this message
[1:27:57] I was
[1:27:59] five or six years old
[1:28:02] when the message came to my family my
[1:28:05] father
[1:28:07] so I grew up listening to the tapes
[1:28:12] amen and and living a good holy life
[1:28:17] going to church Faithfully
[1:28:20] amen if you were to look at me you'd say
[1:28:22] man that's a Believer and I was a
[1:28:26] Believer
[1:28:27] amen I was saved and sanctified
[1:28:33] but I began to realize and see in the
[1:28:36] word
[1:28:39] I wasn't living in the spirit
[1:28:44] I needed to come that last step
[1:28:48] hey man it didn't matter how long
[1:28:54] I
[1:28:58] have more complete amen I wasn't walking
[1:29:02] in the spirit
[1:29:03] oh sure I was spirituality
[1:29:07] went to church
[1:29:10] sing songs
[1:29:12] amen I think I was even a song leader
[1:29:15] for a while
[1:29:18] amen amen I hate to say this but our
[1:29:23] churches are filled with them said
[1:29:25] they're in every Church
[1:29:31] we have a choice
[1:29:33] when we hear the voice of God
[1:29:37] are we going to follow all the way
[1:29:43] The Showdown is on the spectacular when
[1:29:46] you hear a witness
[1:29:48] and I'm a witness this morning
[1:29:51] I'm here to tell you the land is good
[1:29:55] I'm here to tell you there's power in
[1:29:58] the Holy Spirit
[1:30:01] I went from a young man who lived a holy
[1:30:04] life just by my own strength
[1:30:10] to a man that lived a holy Life by the
[1:30:14] power of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:19] amen I'm here to tell you that the land
[1:30:22] is good
[1:30:24] that the promise is true
[1:30:28] I'm here to testify this morning
[1:30:32] amen that The Grapes of the Lambs
[1:30:36] oh they're sweet Brothers
[1:30:41] they're good
[1:30:43] amen they're the biggest grapes you've
[1:30:46] ever seen
[1:30:48] I'm here to tell you there are giants in
[1:30:50] the land
[1:30:52] hey man I'm here to tell you that it is
[1:30:54] a fight it is a battle
[1:30:58] but I'm here to tell you that there's a
[1:31:00] power to overcome
[1:31:04] amen you will not overcome laodicea
[1:31:09] without the spirit of God
[1:31:14] that is the power to overcome
[1:31:18] amen amen that's what we need in this
[1:31:22] hour
[1:31:24] and they said no those Giants are
[1:31:27] stronger than we are
[1:31:31] so hello
[1:31:34] they are stronger they're bigger they're
[1:31:38] better equipped they're better arms
[1:31:42] they've got walls
[1:31:44] but God is with us
[1:31:49] hallelujah amen
[1:31:52] but that wasn't their testimony they
[1:31:53] said we can't do it
[1:31:56] it's okay to be weak
[1:32:00] and to admit you're no match for the
[1:32:03] enemy
[1:32:05] amen because leaning on your own
[1:32:08] strength leads to defeat
[1:32:12] amen
[1:32:15] but Caleb and Joshua weren't looking at
[1:32:18] their own strength is
[1:32:21] they were looking at the promise
[1:32:26] amen I don't know how we're gonna take
[1:32:28] the land
[1:32:30] but God promised it
[1:32:34] it's ours it belongs to us
[1:32:38] I'm gonna trust him
[1:32:40] I'm gonna trust his words
[1:32:45] Hallelujah
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:48] oh hallelujah amen
[1:32:51] he said the the people are strong in the
[1:32:54] land
[1:32:57] and Caleb stealed the people and said
[1:33:00] stop
[1:33:03] let's go at once I don't see
[1:33:07] amen amen let's stop messing around here
[1:33:11] amen with our message denominations
[1:33:16] amen this message has become this group
[1:33:20] versus that group
[1:33:23] denominational men's ideas
[1:33:32] amen but that doesn't mean that men
[1:33:35] around the message can't have a
[1:33:37] denominational spirit
[1:33:41] and that Spirit comes right in is
[1:33:45] amen amen
[1:33:48] let's forget all that stuff
[1:33:51] let's live in the spirit
[1:33:55] if you're trusting God you're not
[1:33:57] worried about all those things
[1:34:00] you're not worried about what people
[1:34:02] think
[1:34:04] amen amen one of the most beautiful
[1:34:07] things that God did for me
[1:34:11] in this message there are so many false
[1:34:14] things floating around
[1:34:17] the First shows
[1:34:20] excuse me but they're weird ideas
[1:34:24] lots of weird things
[1:34:28] and you're you're
[1:34:30] if you try and figure it out on your own
[1:34:35] I hear this preacher prominent preacher
[1:34:38] over here saying this
[1:34:40] and then there's this move over here
[1:34:42] yeah and they seem to be gathering
[1:34:45] people
[1:34:46] right in this move over here they've got
[1:34:49] this happening
[1:34:50] they say they're riding they stay there
[1:34:54] they say they're right
[1:34:57] if you try and figure that out on your
[1:35:00] own
[1:35:02] with your mind
[1:35:04] you will fail usually you will be talked
[1:35:08] into this
[1:35:11] using your mind your strength
[1:35:18] amen and I experienced that as a young
[1:35:21] man
[1:35:23] but God through his holy spirit
[1:35:27] amen when he came and baptized me in his
[1:35:31] Spirit
[1:35:32] he spoke directly to me
[1:35:36] amen and he promised that he would lead
[1:35:38] me and guide me
[1:35:41] and he gave me a piece
[1:35:45] in the middle of all kinds of false
[1:35:49] doctrines
[1:35:51] because you see one of the things that
[1:35:54] they use is fear
[1:35:57] if you're not with us you're not in the
[1:36:00] prize
[1:36:02] if you don't see my pet drockton You're
[1:36:04] Not Elected
[1:36:06] right and they use that fear
[1:36:10] and without the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:36:12] combat it it's only sentence
[1:36:15] but once you've met God
[1:36:20] once he's coming sealed you in
[1:36:23] you know that you've met him face to
[1:36:26] face
[1:36:27] you know that you've crossed over Jordan
[1:36:32] then somebody comes and tells you if you
[1:36:34] don't see this you're not elect
[1:36:38] I'll say well if God needs to show me
[1:36:41] that yes
[1:36:43] if I need that he'll give it to me
[1:36:48] [Music]
[1:36:49] because I trust him and I know him
[1:36:52] I'm in a relationship with him
[1:36:56] I speak with him every day
[1:37:00] amen We're In A Love Affair
[1:37:06] we're walking together
[1:37:09] amen amen we're close
[1:37:14] I mean we're close
[1:37:19] so if I need something I know he's going
[1:37:22] to give it to me
[1:37:24] I don't have to be scared into something
[1:37:28] I don't have to be ashamed into
[1:37:31] something
[1:37:34] now I don't mind scaring you or shaming
[1:37:38] you into wanting the Holy Ghost
[1:37:43] once we have that there's no more fear
[1:37:48] if you're still in the winter Wilderness
[1:37:50] you have a right to be afraid
[1:37:53] but once you crossed over
[1:37:57] then you can say God is with me
[1:38:01] I don't fear any Giants I don't fear any
[1:38:05] devil
[1:38:06] the Lord is with us
[1:38:09] that should have been their testimony
[1:38:12] he's brought us through the Red Sea
[1:38:16] amen he's shown us Victory after victory
[1:38:19] we don't have the ability but God is
[1:38:22] with us
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:28] so they were showing their Revelation
[1:38:30] their level of revelation
[1:38:35] oh my
[1:38:37] God hallelujah amen
[1:38:41] praise the Lord Roger
[1:38:47] so the Bible says they brought an evil
[1:38:49] report
[1:38:51] um
[1:38:54] listen to this this is this is numbers
[1:38:56] 13 32 and I'm not just gonna read it for
[1:38:59] you just going to paraphrase it to you
[1:39:03] they said they brought they brought an
[1:39:05] evil report
[1:39:07] and maybe you hadn't seen this but
[1:39:10] they said that the land is eating up the
[1:39:13] inhabitants
[1:39:17] it wasn't just the Giants
[1:39:20] it wasn't just the walled cities
[1:39:23] I said the land is eating up the
[1:39:26] inhabitants some sort of disease right
[1:39:30] amen eating up the inhabitants and I
[1:39:33] imagine it's afraid
[1:39:35] right
[1:39:37] but that doesn't phase a Believer
[1:39:41] because they're not looking at that
[1:39:44] amen and I want to point you to
[1:39:47] something later in Joshua 24 12.
[1:39:51] after they had crossed over and were in
[1:39:54] the land
[1:39:56] and they were taking possession they
[1:39:59] were fighting battles
[1:40:02] he says this he says I sent the Hornet
[1:40:05] before you
[1:40:08] Hallelujah which draved them out before
[1:40:11] you
[1:40:14] do you see that
[1:40:16] here they were afraid because they were
[1:40:19] seeing things in the land
[1:40:22] right disease or maybe they were seeing
[1:40:24] killer Hornets
[1:40:27] in the land and it made them afraid to
[1:40:30] go in
[1:40:31] but that very thing
[1:40:35] God turned around
[1:40:37] and used it on their enemies
[1:40:42] you understand what happens when the
[1:40:44] Devil Comes against a child of God
[1:40:49] it turns around on him
[1:40:52] amen it backfires on him
[1:40:55] amen all it does is draw a child closer
[1:40:58] to God
[1:40:59] foreign amen
[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:16] get his wings singed a couple times and
[1:41:18] you think he'd learn if yeah I'll do
[1:41:20] foreign
[1:41:24] but the men said you know those giants
[1:41:26] we're like grasshoppers in their size
[1:41:31] well how do you know
[1:41:33] how do you know that they think of you
[1:41:35] as grasshoppers
[1:41:38] maybe they're afraid of you
[1:41:43] how do you know the demons
[1:41:47] are looking at you like we can take them
[1:41:49] no
[1:41:50] problems
[1:41:55] maybe when the devil says go go
[1:41:59] a child my my son my daughter
[1:42:06] you may last time look what happened
[1:42:11] I got sent back here with my tail
[1:42:13] between my legs amen
[1:42:18] amen defeated thank you
[1:42:22] don't send me after them again
[1:42:24] maybe that
[1:42:27] amen that demon that's sitting there
[1:42:29] that you're afraid of it
[1:42:32] amen they're trembling because you're
[1:42:35] reading your Bible
[1:42:39] to cast them out
[1:42:44] those demons that were sitting there in
[1:42:46] Legion saying don't come on Jesus
[1:42:49] have you come already
[1:42:52] Amen to torture us before our time
[1:42:56] amen amen huh right they were afraid of
[1:43:00] him
[1:43:01] they were they were they were like man
[1:43:03] we were having such a good time
[1:43:06] and a child a Son of God showed up yeah
[1:43:09] I'm feaster driven here amen maybe those
[1:43:11] giants were afraid of them
[1:43:15] Hallelujah
[1:43:19] but it's a bluff brother sister
[1:43:22] Satan is a bluff
[1:43:25] he has no power over the child
[1:43:29] amen all he can do
[1:43:32] is talk you out of your promise
[1:43:36] amen and they were
[1:43:39] afraid
[1:43:42] of the moving of the spirit
[1:43:46] that's what that Promised Land
[1:43:48] represented
[1:43:51] it represented an old-fashioned Holy
[1:43:54] Ghost Pentecostal experience
[1:44:00] he just used the p word amen
[1:44:06] I don't apologize for it you should I
[1:44:09] say this I know your password
[1:44:12] amen it's become a bad word in many
[1:44:15] messages
[1:44:21] we're talking about the experience of
[1:44:24] the Holy Ghost experience the life of
[1:44:28] God
[1:44:29] and people are afraid of it
[1:44:32] the very thing that was sent to save
[1:44:35] them and to deliver them
[1:44:39] amen demons being cast out
[1:44:43] people screaming and shouting getting
[1:44:45] the victory
[1:44:48] amen the very thing that was sent to
[1:44:51] save you
[1:44:54] that's the very thing people want to
[1:44:56] bind up and keep out of the church
[1:45:00] amen they want to put a wet blanket on a
[1:45:03] service
[1:45:05] and they don't want the spirit moving in
[1:45:07] the services
[1:45:12] because their flesh might have to die
[1:45:14] the
[1:45:18] uncomfortable
[1:45:22] brother Adam said that they were
[1:45:24] snotting bawling
[1:45:26] Pentecostal babies
[1:45:29] right amen why your flesh doesn't enjoy
[1:45:33] that
[1:45:35] your flesh doesn't enjoy
[1:45:37] uh dying out
[1:45:41] your flesh doesn't enjoy losing control
[1:45:45] but your soul rejoices
[1:45:49] amen when the spirit of God begins to
[1:45:52] move
[1:45:53] your soul is being ministered to you
[1:45:58] hey man your flesh says oh my back is
[1:46:01] tired my knees hurt
[1:46:04] um
[1:46:11] Lord I need more
[1:46:15] amen I'm fighting a battle today
[1:46:19] I've got Giants before me
[1:46:22] I'm taking possession of what you gave
[1:46:25] to me Lord
[1:46:27] but I need more of you Lord I need more
[1:46:30] of your spirit
[1:46:32] amen amen but you see it's like Samson
[1:46:36] the voice to come some song Sampson was
[1:46:38] sent to the people as a deliverer
[1:46:42] all right he was specifically Chosen and
[1:46:46] and created by God to be a deliverer in
[1:46:48] this specifications
[1:46:51] amen and do you know that he was bound
[1:46:57] and handed to the Enemy
[1:47:00] by his own people
[1:47:04] the ones that he was sent to deliver
[1:47:09] they bound him up and gave him to the
[1:47:12] enemies
[1:47:14] amen that's what people do with the Holy
[1:47:17] ghosts
[1:47:19] they bind up the moving of the spirit
[1:47:23] amen they they say oh that's for an age
[1:47:27] pass it is
[1:47:29] or that's for babies we have so much
[1:47:32] more Revelation now
[1:47:34] we're so far beyond that
[1:47:38] amen they're so far beyond it in their
[1:47:41] own intellect that they've missed it
[1:47:43] completely amen
[1:47:49] we do have the revealed word
[1:47:52] we do have amazing insight into the
[1:47:56] Bible
[1:47:59] we have things that the prophet brought
[1:48:02] out of the scripture that just make your
[1:48:04] head spin um
[1:48:08] but none of it matters
[1:48:12] without the spirit to make it live
[1:48:19] amen I'm sure you've met them I've run
[1:48:22] into people that are so revelated
[1:48:26] that they revelated themselves out of
[1:48:28] life
[1:48:33] so intellectual
[1:48:36] amen resting on their understanding of
[1:48:40] the message
[1:48:42] instead of the spirit of God moving in
[1:48:45] their life amen
[1:48:50] I I believe in reading the word
[1:48:54] amen and I study the word
[1:48:57] amen but it doesn't do me any good
[1:49:01] without the Holy Spirit
[1:49:05] coming and anointing that word
[1:49:09] amen amen in our services we can preach
[1:49:13] preach and preach
[1:49:16] but it doesn't matter unless the holy
[1:49:19] spirit
[1:49:22] amen and moves on our hearts it makes it
[1:49:26] real
[1:49:28] why because he is a person
[1:49:34] amen amen
[1:49:35] this is about a person
[1:49:40] the person of the word
[1:49:44] brother random preached the Mighty God
[1:49:45] unveiled before us
[1:49:48] what was it it wasn't so that we could
[1:49:50] take this verse and tie it to this verse
[1:49:52] over here
[1:49:56] it was so we could know the person
[1:50:04] oh Hallelujah
[1:50:06] to know him
[1:50:10] but know him as he really is
[1:50:14] to walk with him like Enoch walked with
[1:50:17] him
[1:50:19] my hand in his and his hand in mind my
[1:50:22] mind amen
[1:50:25] and just like Enoch us where he walked
[1:50:29] with God and had fellowship with him
[1:50:33] one day God said you know we knocked
[1:50:36] just that one take one more step
[1:50:40] just come on up come up higher
[1:50:44] amen amen
[1:50:46] it's a person that we're talking about
[1:50:49] here
[1:50:50] amen the person of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:56] hallelujah amen I don't even know how
[1:50:59] long are we yeah okay
[1:51:04] amen amen
[1:51:06] Hallelujah we'll try and
[1:51:09] wrap this up somehow
[1:51:13] Hallelujah
[1:51:16] brother random says in the smyrnian
[1:51:18] church age
[1:51:20] Believing on Jesus is the step in the
[1:51:23] right direction which is toward the holy
[1:51:25] ghosts
[1:51:30] but the people stop there
[1:51:34] they go as far as the water and stop
[1:51:40] they believe and then stop right
[1:51:45] the Bible does not say that when you re
[1:51:47] you receive when you believe in
[1:51:53] it is have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:51:56] since you believe me
[1:52:01] you see people seem to forget this in
[1:52:03] this message
[1:52:10] I'm a message believer
[1:52:12] I've been baptized have you received the
[1:52:16] Holy Ghost since
[1:52:20] amen amen he says the exact and literal
[1:52:24] translation is did you having previously
[1:52:27] believed received the Holy ghosts
[1:52:34] but he says the people believe and then
[1:52:37] stop it
[1:52:41] now he's not just talking about
[1:52:44] 1960.
[1:52:49] this is now
[1:52:52] he says you don't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:52:54] when you believe unto him having
[1:52:55] repented
[1:53:00] you go on and receive the Holy Ghost
[1:53:04] that's wrong with our fundamentalists
[1:53:09] and we have fundamentalists in this
[1:53:11] message
[1:53:13] he says they have no power
[1:53:16] for they stop short of Pentecost
[1:53:23] they're like the children of Israel who
[1:53:25] came out of Egypt and stopped short of
[1:53:27] the promised life
[1:53:31] those children of Israel left Egypt
[1:53:33] about 2 million strong phone
[1:53:41] they all journey together
[1:53:44] all saw the same miracles
[1:53:52] massage amen amen all partook of the
[1:53:56] same manner
[1:53:59] they've heard the same tapes
[1:54:02] water from the smitten
[1:54:06] Rocky I'll follow the same Cloud by day
[1:54:09] in the pillar of Fire by night
[1:54:15] but out of that two million brother
[1:54:18] sisters
[1:54:20] only two so do reach the promised land
[1:54:26] true or real Believers
[1:54:32] that is correct is it correct because
[1:54:35] the word tells us the rest died because
[1:54:37] of unbelief
[1:54:40] because of unbelief they could not enter
[1:54:42] in yeah
[1:54:45] amen since this is so it comes
[1:54:49] and only two entered
[1:54:52] entree then the rest were not true
[1:54:53] believers
[1:54:55] a True Believer is filled with the
[1:54:58] spirit is free amen
[1:55:02] amen what made the difference he says
[1:55:05] to stay with the word
[1:55:09] now the others on the other side when I
[1:55:11] said we're following Moses message
[1:55:15] that's exactly what he said
[1:55:20] but they weren't doing what he said
[1:55:24] they were saying what he said if this is
[1:55:28] not doing what he said
[1:55:34] the two stayed with the word
[1:55:37] when the hearts of the ten spies failed
[1:55:40] at kadish
[1:55:42] this is
[1:55:47] Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for
[1:55:49] they believed the words
[1:55:54] and they said we are more than able to
[1:55:57] take the land
[1:56:00] they knew that they could because God
[1:56:03] had said I have given you the land
[1:56:08] after all those Israelites saw of the
[1:56:11] power and goodness
[1:56:16] they couldn't say God wasn't a Healer
[1:56:20] they couldn't say God wasn't with them
[1:56:24] all that they had seen
[1:56:27] and the Deliverance of God
[1:56:30] they did not enter into rest
[1:56:34] foreign
[1:56:39] so you can see right now that very few
[1:56:41] will ever believe all the way
[1:56:53] all the way to receiving the spirit of
[1:56:57] God
[1:57:01] amen
[1:57:05] Jesus has crossed
[1:57:07] death
[1:57:10] and he proved that the resurrection is
[1:57:15] true yeah
[1:57:17] he has resurrection power
[1:57:20] we prove that the word was true
[1:57:24] amen amen we've seen the evidence
[1:57:29] he's the evidence of the Resurrection
[1:57:33] we we have heard Witnesses
[1:57:39] my life was changed
[1:57:41] I was religious before but now I'm
[1:57:44] spirit filled
[1:57:47] we've heard the witnesses
[1:57:50] and then we now we come up to our
[1:57:53] decision our Showdown
[1:57:57] amen will we take the way with the
[1:58:00] Lord's despised few construation
[1:58:06] die out to our flesh
[1:58:10] and walk in the spirit
[1:58:22] amen amen laying our lives down
[1:58:31] maybe you're at the border this morning
[1:58:36] I'm here to tell you it's for you amen
[1:58:41] it's for you
[1:58:45] maybe you have crossed over but you lost
[1:58:48] sight
[1:58:52] you're in a battle you're gonna still be
[1:58:55] in a battle
[1:58:59] but it's your land
[1:59:02] that's your promise
[1:59:05] amen amen don't let anything stand
[1:59:08] before you
[1:59:12] brother random tells the story of a man
[1:59:15] His Name Escapes me at the moment
[1:59:20] being over 40. I'll do that uh
[1:59:25] he was seeking the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:28] Spirit
[1:59:30] and he got to a place of desperation
[1:59:34] and he said Lord if you don't come
[1:59:37] you're gonna find me laying here a pile
[1:59:40] of bones
[1:59:42] right because he had gotten to a place
[1:59:47] where he didn't care about anything else
[1:59:53] and brother as as a minister
[1:59:57] I can tell when people are serious about
[1:59:59] God
[2:00:01] because they don't let little things get
[2:00:04] in the way
[2:00:06] amen if someone is really seeking God
[2:00:11] we were talking about baptism yesterday
[2:00:14] if someone has a revelation that God has
[2:00:17] given them that they need to be baptized
[2:00:22] they do not care if the water is cold or
[2:00:25] hot in regards
[2:00:28] shoulder they know that they need to do
[2:00:31] that
[2:00:32] they're not worried about you know is it
[2:00:34] going to be sunny
[2:00:38] right that's not on their minds
[2:00:42] something is stirring in their heart
[2:00:44] saying I need God
[2:00:48] and I can tell when somebody is seeking
[2:00:51] the Holy Ghost
[2:00:54] if they're just coming at it very casual
[2:00:58] right well if God give it to me it's
[2:01:01] okay if not you know
[2:01:07] this is life
[2:01:11] without that you will not go in the
[2:01:14] rapture
[2:01:17] amen amen it's serious and you can tell
[2:01:21] when somebody is on the right track
[2:01:24] because they're they're of one mind
[2:01:27] singleness of heart
[2:01:31] amen they start to get an attitude like
[2:01:34] Caleb and Joshua had yeah
[2:01:39] this is my promise
[2:01:42] I'm not gonna let all these other
[2:01:44] distractions keep me from it
[2:01:49] I need this I know I mean
[2:01:53] maybe I've played around with it in the
[2:01:58] paste
[2:02:01] put a smile on my face
[2:02:04] but deep down inside I know I need God
[2:02:10] Amen and I'm not gonna let anything
[2:02:12] stand in my way
[2:02:15] the kind that's on the right track
[2:02:19] when you're going to receive the promise
[2:02:24] amen you know people that complain about
[2:02:28] things in the church I know that their
[2:02:30] hearts aren't right

[2:02:40] know

[2:02:44] leader saying

[2:02:49] don't even worry about this
[2:02:54] you've come to meet with God
[2:02:58] oh the seats are too hard
[2:03:03] now look your flesh will still do that
[2:03:09] confession is good for the soul

[2:03:16] hurts
[2:03:18] right the preacher preaches too long
[2:03:22] amen the the building is too hot
[2:03:27] but through the spirit
