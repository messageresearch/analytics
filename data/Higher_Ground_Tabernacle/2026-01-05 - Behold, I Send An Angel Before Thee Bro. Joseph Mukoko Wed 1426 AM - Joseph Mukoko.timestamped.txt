[40:48] Can somebody shout, "Praise the Lord."
[40:52] Amen.
[40:54] Friendship with Jesus.
[40:57] One writer says, "Falling in love with
[40:58] Jesus was the best thing I've ever
[41:00] done." Amen. He will never ever forsake
[41:03] you.
[41:05] Amen. This morning we have the pleasure
[41:08] of having uh brother Joseph Makoko. He
[41:12] will be speaking for us. Amen. He is a
[41:15] minister down in um in Denver, Colorado.
[41:21] Originally he is um I always tease him
[41:25] and say he has an identity crisis.
[41:28] He is um
[41:30] Ivorian and Congalles.
[41:33] Amen. He's a very close friend of mine.
[41:36] We've known each other for over 12
[41:38] years.
[41:39] Amen. Thank God. Thankful to God for
[41:42] such a friendship. But um this morning
[41:44] he'll be speaking for us. So just pull
[41:47] on the gift so God can bless you. So
[41:51] just let him get out of the way and let
[41:54] go and let God have his way. Amen. So we
[41:58] can be blessed. If you have a heart
[41:59] desire, amen, just pull whatever you
[42:02] need. However you came expecting, that's
[42:05] what you get.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I heard in one place they had a
[42:10] drought
[42:13] and they came relief of water. Amen. And
[42:17] they told people, you need to come and
[42:18] get water for yourselves [music]
[42:20] so that you can get relief from the
[42:22] drought. Some people went with cups,
[42:26] some went with buckets,
[42:28] some went with drums.
[42:30] And whatever container you went with,
[42:32] that's what you came back with. So if
[42:34] you went with a cup, you only come back
[42:36] with a cup of water. If you went with a
[42:39] drum, you'd come back home with a drum
[42:41] full of water. Amen. So today, whatever
[42:44] you came expecting, whatever container
[42:47] your faith has, that's how much you will
[42:50] receive from the Lord. Amen.
[42:52] Amen. We'll sing Falling in Love as
[42:55] Brother Joseph gets ready to come.
[43:00] Falling in love
[43:03] with Jesus.
[43:07] Oh yes.

[43:19] Falling in love

[43:50] with [music] Jesus.
[43:57] Falling [singing] in love
[43:59] with Jesus. [music]
[44:04] That was the best thing I've
[44:06] [singing and music] ever
[44:08] ever done.
[44:14] Amen.
[44:16] How many are happy to be here this
[44:18] morning?
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Can you turn to your neighbor and then
[44:24] say, "God bless you."
[44:28] Um, God willing, we all going to be
[44:31] together again this year of 202.
[44:37] Um, and I would like to wish everybody
[44:39] happy new year.
[44:42] And may God blessing be on everybody
[44:50] and I always feel very
[44:53] happy every time I'm here.
[44:58] Um God has given me very good friends
[45:01] here
[45:04] and you know the prophet said good
[45:06] friendships comes from God.
[45:12] And I believe that there are very good
[45:15] children of God here.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; And how many can say amen.
[45:23] And I did not come alone. I came with my
[45:25] wife.
[45:28] I was single.
[45:32] But now um
[45:34] I'm married.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Um I don't know if you saw her, she can
[45:38] raise her hand.
[45:43] So,
[45:44] I'm going to ask you to forgive me. Um,
[45:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not very fast when it comes to
[45:52] preaching in English.
[45:56] So, my going to have to switch to
[45:58] friends.
[46:01] But, um, all the all the codes if you
[46:03] need them, I already give to the back.
[46:05] You can ask them.
[46:12] Without further ado,
[46:17] I
[46:17] &gt;&gt; just have a little subject topic to
[46:19] encourage the people of God.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; And if you can get the message in 20
[46:27] minutes, we can pack up pack up our
[46:28] stuff and go home.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to try to keep you too
[46:32] long here.
[46:39] So, we're going to open our Bibles in
[46:41] the book book of Exodus chapter 23 verse
[46:44] 20.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Exodus
[46:49] chapter 23 verse 20. Um,
[46:56] &gt;&gt; start reading.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible says this.
[47:10] Behold, I send an angel before thee to
[47:14] keep thee in the way, and to to bring
[47:16] thee into the place which I have
[47:18] prepared.
[47:26] Brother says when you read the Bible,
[47:28] you have to pay attention to the little
[47:29] details because the little the little
[47:31] details make a difference.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; So I want you to pay attention so you
[47:38] don't miss anything.
[47:43] The Bible says 21, beware of him and
[47:46] obey his voice.
[47:51] Obey, Obey his voice. Provoke him not.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; For he will not pardon your
[48:00] transgressions, for my name is in him.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; So, it's starting to excite me already
[48:06] intrigued me to to intrigue me
[48:13] &gt;&gt; because I understand who is this angel
[48:15] that that the Lord says that his name is
[48:17] in him.
[48:22] So this angel must be particular
[48:26] because
[48:28] &gt;&gt; you have to listen to his voice because
[48:32] &gt;&gt; because if you resist him, he will not
[48:34] pardon your sins.
[48:41] 22 says, "But if thou shalt indeed obey
[48:43] his voice,
[48:48] and do all that I speak,
[48:52] then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies
[48:58] &gt;&gt; and an adversary unto thy adversaries
[49:03] in different terms. If if you want God
[49:05] to be enemies of your enemies,
[49:12] &gt;&gt; you must listen to the voice of that
[49:14] angel.
[49:19] 23 says, "For mine angel shall go before
[49:22] thee,
[49:25] and bring thee unto the Amorites,
[49:29] and the Hittites,
[49:31] &gt;&gt; and the Parizzites,
[49:34] and the Canaanites,
[49:36] and the Hivites,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; and the Jebusites,
[49:43] &gt;&gt; and I will cut them
[49:50] The Bible says this angel is is led is
[49:53] is led to to the enemies.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; He's leading them to the territory of
[50:00] the of the enemies.
[50:06] And I'm going to read another verse.
[50:08] It's going to be Psalm chapter 104 verse
[50:11] one.
[50:15] The Bible says, "My soul," um, verse
[50:19] one, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[50:24] &gt;&gt; oh Lord, my God, thou are very great.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Thou are clothed with honor and
[50:34] majesty."
[50:36] So
[50:40] &gt;&gt; this verse says, "Who coverth thyself
[50:42] with lights as with a a garment?
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Who stretches out the heavens like a
[50:49] curtain?
[50:54] Who layeth the beams of his chambers in
[50:56] the waters.
[51:00] Who makes the cloud his chariot.
[51:04] who walketh upon the wings of the wind.
[51:07] Verse four,
[51:11] &gt;&gt; who makes his angels spirits,
[51:16] &gt;&gt; his minister is a flaming fire.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Pray. Let's pray.
[51:22] Our heavenly father,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; what a precious moment to be in your
[51:28] house.
[51:31] We could feel your presence when we were
[51:32] singing
[51:35] &gt;&gt; and we came with with a need
[51:38] and you're the only one that can answer
[51:40] to those needs.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; So then we commit everything
[51:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:47] that we prayed. Amen.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] So then you can have your seats.
[51:56] I want to talk about a little sermon.
[52:03] It's a big topic that the brother talked
[52:05] about
[52:09] and I'm just going to take a little
[52:11] angle from that large topic
[52:15] and then in just a couple minutes we'll
[52:17] go home.
[52:22] My sermon title will behold I send an
[52:25] angel before thee.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send my angel before thee.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; And just to start this, we're going to
[52:40] start a little race in our in the book
[52:42] of Acts.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; I like to read my Bible.
[52:52] because I understand the message better.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brah says a Christian must read
[53:00] his Bible every day. Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Is that is you can I get an amen on
[53:03] this?
[53:07] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says in Act 12:1,
[53:14] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Now about that time,
[53:20] Herod the king stretched forth his hands
[53:22] to back certain of his. So pay attention
[53:25] verse two
[53:32] &gt;&gt; and he killed James the brother of John
[53:34] with a sword.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; So the verse three is what uh
[53:43] it says and because he saw it pleased
[53:45] the Jews
[53:49] He proceeded further to take Peter also.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Then were the days of unleven bread.
[54:01] So then we understand that Aerod killed
[54:04] James brother John
[54:09] and because a certain group of the Jews
[54:11] were pleased
[54:16] he also arrested Peter to do the same
[54:19] thing.
[54:21] Why?
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Because it pleased the crowd.
[54:31] But whether you you want it or not, some
[54:32] people are predestinated to do evil.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And whether you want it or not, the
[54:40] prayer cannot change that fact.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Because we're here to fulfill the will
[54:47] of our father.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; And if there are here people to who are
[54:54] here to fulfill to to do evil,
[54:58] That means we also have people who are
[55:00] predestinated to do to do good.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; So that's why you not you don't
[55:05] understand.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; You don't understand when they do evil
[55:08] to you.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; You're not able to to return evil to to
[55:14] return evil against evil because
[55:21] your nature is not made up made up of
[55:24] evil.
[55:26] So I'm try I want to encourage somebody
[55:28] this morning.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Continue to live with the nature that
[55:35] God placed in.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[55:40] So then they arrested Peter, isn't isn't
[55:42] it?
[55:46] Verse four says, "And when he had
[55:48] apprehended him and PUT HIM IN PRISON,"
[55:50] now follow the details.
[55:55] It says and delivered him to four uh
[55:58] quarter cornons of soldiers
[56:02] &gt;&gt; of soldiers to keep him.
[56:05] So if I multiply four by by four,
[56:11] &gt;&gt; then understand that Peter was kept by
[56:14] 16 soldiers
[56:20] &gt;&gt; and their intention was to bring him
[56:21] before the people after Passover.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; So they killed J
[56:28] and Peter was the was next on the line.
[56:34] So, so then ask yourself a question. Why
[56:35] were they trying to kill Peter?
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because in that time Peter was was
[56:42] a chief of the apostles.
[56:46] And you understand that if you cut the
[56:48] head, all the sheeps are scattered.
[56:55] So that was the plan of the devil
[56:56] through.
[57:01] Now, verse five is where I'm going to
[57:02] bother some of you.
[57:05] I'm going to look at the translator.
[57:08] So then that he's we're not going to say
[57:10] he was talking about me. The Bible says,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; it says, "Peter therefore was kept in
[57:17] prison,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; but prayer was made without seizing of
[57:25] the church unto God for him.
[57:29] prayer without ceasing.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So then I understand that when the
[57:35] brother's in trouble,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go talk about it,
[57:42] understand that when my brother's in
[57:44] trouble.
[57:47] I'm not going to get my phone to post
[57:48] the story about IT
[57:51] because posting the story
[57:54] will not bring down on the scene.
[58:00] the church were praying were making a
[58:03] prayer for Peter.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; So then I pray that in the name of Jesus
[58:07] Christ
[58:09] that in this year 2022
[58:12] &gt;&gt; that if your brother is in trouble,
[58:16] I pray that their church goes in prayer
[58:20] so God can intervene.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says
[58:28] He says the biggest WEAPON THAT GOD HAS
[58:30] EVER GIVEN THE CHURCH IS NOT TO SING.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; It's not dancing,
[58:37] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S PRAYER.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[58:41] Because when you pray,
[58:45] something happens in the spiritual
[58:47] realm. Can I go forward?
[58:50] Brother Brandham says prayer
[58:54] &gt;&gt; IS NOT TO BRING GOD DOWN.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says prayer
[59:00] &gt;&gt; is to go up to God.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ASK YOU A QUESTION.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOES UP TO GOD?
[59:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PHYSICALLY
[59:09] you're sitting on a chair.
[59:13] But when you start praying,
[59:17] why the Bible says SOMETHING STARTS TO
[59:19] GO TO GOD.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; SO THEN WHAT IS THAT? Let's go TO GOD.
[59:25] But
[59:25] &gt;&gt; let me tell you THAT THERE IS A SOUL
[59:26] INSIDE OF YOU
[59:29] THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE SICK, THE BODY OF
[59:31] SIN, THE SOUL CAN TRAVEL.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; SO THIS MORNING,
[59:37] &gt;&gt; let's travel.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Let's leave this tabernacle.
[59:43] AND LET'S GET INSIDE THE PRESENCE OF
[59:45] GOD.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, "Let's travel.
[59:51] Let's leave this tabernacle.
[59:55] Let's go get out from from
[59:59] Let's get get out from from
[1:00:04] let's get inside the word of
[1:00:06] infallibility."
[1:00:09] Satan was thinking
[1:00:11] that by killing Jesus,
[1:00:14] he thought he would stop him from
[1:00:15] preaching.
[1:00:18] But brother Brown says Jesus was a
[1:00:20] PREACHER WHO COULDN'T STOP. AT 12 years
[1:00:23] old, HE WAS STILL PREACHING.
[1:00:25] AT 31 YEARS OLD, JESUS WAS STILL
[1:00:27] PREACHING. WHEN THEY PUT HIM IN THE
[1:00:29] TOMB,
[1:00:31] JESUS STILL WENT TO PREACH.
[1:00:34] So do not lower yourself.
[1:00:38] Your prayer has a power inside of it.
[1:00:43] Brother Bible says when the weakest of
[1:00:45] Christian
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; get down to his knees,
[1:00:50] when he starts praying,
[1:00:53] all hell begins to shake.
[1:00:57] So I refuse to be the weakest OF PERSON.
[1:01:01] So then if you're not the weakest of
[1:01:03] Christian
[1:01:04] when I start praying,
[1:01:07] hell has to shake more more than two
[1:01:10] times.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; So that I came to to to to revive you
[1:01:16] revolution.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; You know that the biggest revolution
[1:01:22] the biggest revival revolution happens
[1:01:24] when people are TIRED OF IT.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
[1:01:29] SO NOW WE HAVE TO GET UP.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Satan can let you sing.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; The only thing Satan will stop you from
[1:01:38] doing will be praying
[1:01:41] because he knows that when you start
[1:01:43] praying,
[1:01:45] there's something that start to bo that
[1:01:47] starts start to bother him. I'm going to
[1:01:50] bother somebody.
[1:01:53] Can I can you say today I'm going to
[1:01:54] consecrate all day.
[1:02:02] Then just the day you said you were
[1:02:03] consecrated, that's when you see that
[1:02:05] your child as a demon THAT THAT THAT
[1:02:07] JUST bothering you.
[1:02:11] So you understand that Satan is trying
[1:02:13] to to stop you from praying.
[1:02:16] So tell your neighbor, let's pray more
[1:02:18] in 2026.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Let's pray more in 2026.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things.
[1:02:26] Prayer changes things.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; So the people were making prayers.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; They were making prayers for Peter
[1:02:47] because even because of the fact that
[1:02:48] they saw pe uh James dieite despite the
[1:02:52] fact that they saw James die.
[1:02:56] It did not discourage them to pray for
[1:02:58] Peter
[1:03:01] because if God did not answer their
[1:03:03] prayer for James,
[1:03:06] then that means it was the will of God
[1:03:08] for James to go in that time
[1:03:11] and it's not the proof that he's not
[1:03:13] going to answer our prayer for Peter.
[1:03:17] So then verse six
[1:03:20] now now excuse me
[1:03:23] I have the ways of of a village guy.
[1:03:27] So now act like a village guy. So if you
[1:03:29] see me jump just forgive me
[1:03:35] the verses. And when would have brought
[1:03:37] him forth the same night
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; the same night Peter uh was sleeping
[1:03:43] between two soldiers with two chains.
[1:03:47] He was bound with two chains slipping
[1:03:49] between two soldiers.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; And the keepers before the door kept the
[1:03:56] prison.
[1:03:58] So this is where we're going to start.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And behold,
[1:04:06] the Bible says when you hear of behold,
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; that means YOU HAVE TO STOP EVERYTHING
[1:04:12] [screaming]
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; and you HAVE TO LISTEN
[1:04:15] and behold.
[1:04:19] The angel of the Lord came upon him
[1:04:25] and the light shined IN THE PRISON.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; I LOVE THIS PART
[1:04:31] and he smoked Peter on the Can I speak?
[1:04:37] The angel did not confuse between Peter
[1:04:39] and the
[1:04:42] He did not confuse Peter AND AOS.
[1:04:45] THE angel knew who PETER WAS.
[1:04:50] I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU, the angel KNOWS
[1:04:52] WHO YOU ARE
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; AND HE knows your name
[1:04:58] and he knows the color of your car.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; He knows your home address.
[1:05:06] Not that he just woke up Peter,
[1:05:10] BUT how did he wake him up?
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; the angel woke up Peter.
[1:05:19] AND HE SMOKED HIM ON THE HE SMOKED him
[1:05:21] on the side
[1:05:23] to WAKE UP PETER.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; HE had to touch him.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; So then I pray THAT IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:05:31] Christ
[1:05:33] that the ANGEL OF THE LORD TOUCHES
[1:05:35] SOMEBODY HERE.
[1:05:38] NOT that he does it in A VISION,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; BUT I want him to touch him physically
[1:05:45] [screaming] that HE TOUCHES YOU
[1:05:48] where you're SICK
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; and the healing operates.
[1:05:54] I'M FEELING GOOD NOW. LISTEN,
[1:05:58] after smiting
[1:06:00] him on hitting him on the side, the
[1:06:03] Bible says,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[1:06:08] "Arise quickly.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Arise quickly.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Arise quickly."
[1:06:17] Brother says, "God loves a quick
[1:06:19] action."
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; God does not love people with reasons.
[1:06:24] SO THEN MY QUESTION TO YOU IS
[1:06:27] PETER WAS BOUND WITH CHAINS. [screaming]
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; HE COULD NOT RISE TO THE EARTH.
[1:06:32] BUT IF YOU READ,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK, "WELL, I'M BOUND.
[1:06:37] I CAN'T GET UP."
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; BUT THE ANGEL TELLS YOU, [screaming]
[1:06:42] "A RISE QUICKLY.
[1:06:44] CAN I GET CAN I GO?
[1:06:47] IT'S IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS IF I'M
[1:06:49] BOUND TO CHANGE BECAUSE I KNOW
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; that while I'm GETTING UP
[1:06:56] SOMETHING is going to happen.
[1:06:59] It's not my BUSINESS TO THINK.
[1:07:02] ALL I HAVE TO DO
[1:07:05] IS TO obey to the voice of the angel.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Arise quickly.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, ARISE QUICKLY.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; ACT QUICKLY.
[1:07:17] ARISE UP quickly
[1:07:22] and his chains fell off from his hands.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; My question to you is
[1:07:28] who freed up Peter?
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Did Peter set himself free?
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Peter himself
[1:07:37] recognized.
[1:07:39] He recognized that his time was at hand.
[1:07:41] HE WAS GOING TO DIE.
[1:07:43] BUT THE PRAYER OF THE SAINTS
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; forced the angel TO COME DOWN
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; TO SET PETER FREE.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; THEY TOLD GOD,
[1:07:56] "YOU TOOK JAMES AWAY FROM US.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOOD.
[1:08:01] But we're not ready to lose Peter.
[1:08:04] [screaming]
[1:08:06] Peter was a pillar in this ministry."
[1:08:10] So that PRE THAT PRAYER BROUGHT the
[1:08:12] angel down.
[1:08:14] And the thing that excites me is
[1:08:18] is that the DOOR DID NOT STOP the angel
[1:08:20] from getting in.
[1:08:23] They were in prison.
[1:08:26] THE DOOR DID NOT STOP THE ANGEL from
[1:08:28] getting in. Can I go forward?
[1:08:31] YOUR PROBLEM SHOULD NOT STOP THE ANGEL
[1:08:33] FROM GETTING INSIDE YOUR HEAD.
[1:08:36] THE ANGEL IS NOT STOPPED BY THE WALLS.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; He's not stopped BY THE DOORS.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; HE CAN PENETRATE THE WALLS
[1:08:47] TO SET YOU FREE.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good.
[1:08:53] I I want I want to shout AMEN
[1:08:58] because that's WHAT MAKES THIS MESSAGE
[1:08:59] PARTICULARLY.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; We don't COUNT OR NOT MATTER.
[1:09:04] He says, "Behold,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; I send my angel before thee
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; for you to get married.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I send my angel BEFORE THEE
[1:09:15] FOR YOU to receive your healing.
[1:09:18] I send my angel before thee
[1:09:22] for YOU TO GET INSIDE THE MINISTRY OF
[1:09:24] POOL. I send my angel before thee."
[1:09:29] the the most secured person on the
[1:09:31] planet
[1:09:33] is not the president the president OF A
[1:09:35] REPUBLIC.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU ARE THE MOST
[1:09:38] SECURED PERSON.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Let me talk like Elijah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:09:48] open the eyes of these people.
[1:09:52] When you realize that you're not alone,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; then fear will leave you,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; doubts will leave you
[1:10:02] to know that a supernatural being WALKS
[1:10:04] INSIDE OF YOU. THEN HE TOLD PETER,
[1:10:08] "FOLLOW ME."
[1:10:11] Then Peter said, "How are we GOING TO
[1:10:12] GET OUT?"
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; THE THE GUARDS are at the DOOR ARE RIGHT
[1:10:15] THERE.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE uh they're
[1:10:18] they're standing right there.
[1:10:20] Can I go forward?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; The angel allowed Peter for a couple a
[1:10:26] couple of minutes.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; He made him invisible in the eyes of THE
[1:10:32] GUARDS.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Peter was walking before THOSE GUARDS.
[1:10:37] CAN YOU SEE ME?
[1:10:40] THE BIBLE SAYS HE THOUGHT HE WAS IN A
[1:10:42] VISION,
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS REALITY.
[1:10:46] THEY CAN'T SEE ME.
[1:10:48] THE ANGEL SAID, "FATHER."
[1:10:52] Then they said, "When they got TO THE
[1:10:53] THE GATES of the city,
[1:10:56] Peter said, "How are we going to open
[1:10:57] the door?"
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS, "AS SOON AS THE ANGEL
[1:11:02] GOT THERE, THE DOOR OPENED, cannot go
[1:11:06] forward.
[1:11:08] I want to TELL YOU THAT SATAN CANNOT
[1:11:10] CREATE.
[1:11:12] SATAN is a is an is impersonator.
[1:11:17] When you go to Walmart, what does the
[1:11:19] door do when you get when you get there?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Do you open the door at Walmart by by
[1:11:24] yourself?
[1:11:26] Satan thinks he's the one who created
[1:11:28] that door.
[1:11:32] The angel already made that invention of
[1:11:35] the morning. I pray in the name of Jesus
[1:11:38] that in 2026
[1:11:42] THAT EVERY DOOR CLOSED BEFORE YOU
[1:11:46] I PRAY THAT THE SAME ANGEL
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; OPENS ALL THOSE DOORS.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you 2026 SLOGAN
[1:11:58] A
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; EPHRA
[1:12:01] EPHRASE
[1:12:05] which means
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; it means open up yourself.
[1:12:10] So when you face a situation
[1:12:13] just tell God Lord
[1:12:16] you said in your word
[1:12:19] that behold I send my angel before thee.
[1:12:22] So then this DOOR THAT'S STANDING BEFORE
[1:12:24] YOU
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; I TELL THAT DOOR
[1:12:28] IT MEANS OPEN UP YOURSELF
[1:12:32] DO NOT DOUBTS IN YOUR HEART
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; because God IS MORE THAN ABLE.
[1:12:40] CAN I GO FORWARD?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; There is nothing that's impossible to
[1:12:45] God.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Does the verse stop right there? IT HAS
[1:12:50] A COMMON.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; IT SAYS, "AND TO THOSE WHO believe in in
[1:12:55] different terms,
[1:12:57] the one who believes is a God.
[1:13:01] And a God
[1:13:04] does not cry WHEN HE FACES SITUATIONS.
[1:13:07] Even if you cry, IT DOES NOT STOP THERE
[1:13:11] because Jesus also cried.
[1:13:14] But then after he cried,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; what did Jesus do?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; DID HE KEEP ON CRYING?
[1:13:23] THE BIBLE SAYS HE ROSE up
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; and he he got he got he got himself back
[1:13:28] together
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; and HE SAYS, "FATHER, I THANK THEE
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED ME
[1:13:38] AND YOU ALWAYS ANSWER ME."
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM says
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; that when you pray
[1:13:45] in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S AS IF JESUS HIMSELF
[1:13:52] WHAT'S PRAYING.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; So then you HAVE A COURAGE TO pray for
[1:13:56] THIS MAN THAT FATHER I THANK YOU
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS ANSWER me
[1:14:03] and he looked at the tomb.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID LAZARUS
[1:14:08] COME [screaming] OUT.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; SO THEN IF YOUR CHILD WAS BOUND
[1:14:14] YOU CAN GET YOURSELF BACK TOGETHER
[1:14:16] [screaming] AND SAYS COME OUT.
[1:14:21] If your HUSBAND WAS BOUND,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR HUSBAND AND TELL
[1:14:26] HIM, "COME OUT.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; I'M EXCITED."
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I CAN SAY LIKE, "BROTHER
[1:14:37] BRANDON,
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; HE COULD SAY ROY,
[1:14:41] WHERE ARE YOU?
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; COME SEE.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; COME SEE GOD DELIVERING HIS PEOPLE.
[1:14:49] SO BE DELIVERED.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; BE SET FREE.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; If you want to start,
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; if you WANT TO START A PROJECT,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; THEN GO START THAT PROJECT
[1:15:07] BECAUSE
[1:15:09] Satan told God,
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; he said, "I can't touch Job.
[1:15:15] I CAN'T TOUCH HIS CHILDREN AND I CAN'T
[1:15:18] TOUCH HIS belongings
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; because there's a protection around him.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; So even your car,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; there's a protection around your car.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Even if your projects,
[1:15:33] there's protections around your project.
[1:15:35] When you go to work,
[1:15:38] THE BOSS SAYS, "I'M GOING TO FIRE YOU."
[1:15:41] You tell them, "You can't fire me.
[1:15:43] You don't have that power on me.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; IF I SAY THE WORD,
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE one that's going to be fired.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Can I start dancing right now?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Because I know that dancing
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; is a sign of victory.
[1:16:04] Well, THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN DAVID WAS
[1:16:05] GOING TO FIGHT GOLIATH,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; DAVID WAS NOT CRYING.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; DAVID WAS NOT WALKING.
[1:16:12] DAVID WAS DANCING
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WHY is he dancing?"
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DAVID KNEW
[1:16:21] that as long as WHILE I'M NOT KING YET,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I'M NOT KING,
[1:16:28] Goliath cannot kill me.
[1:16:33] So, AS LONG AS THAT PROMISE HAS NOT
[1:16:35] ARRIVED YET,
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; SATAN CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO YOU.
[1:16:40] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS
[1:16:43] he says the true faith in the end times
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; is not to believe in WHAT GOD SAYS,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S IT'S to believe IN WHAT YOU
[1:16:52] SAID.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT you said will will
[1:16:55] arrive.
[1:16:57] I'm feeling good
[1:17:01] because I KNOW YOU WILL RECEIVE a
[1:17:02] solution to your problem.
[1:17:04] I don't count on my on my intelligence.
[1:17:08] I DON'T COUNT ON MY STRENGTH,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; but there is a SUPERNATURAL HELP WHO'S
[1:17:14] walking before me.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A SUPERNATURAL HELP that's
[1:17:18] walking before me.
[1:17:21] 10 minutes before I get to work,
[1:17:25] THE ANGEL IS the angel MAKES SURE THAT
[1:17:28] THERE'S NO DEMONS ALREADY.
[1:17:30] He he he makes the way for me. He makes
[1:17:33] a WAY FOR ME.
[1:17:36] AND THEN THE SON OF GOD GETS THERE. HE
[1:17:39] SAYS, "MAKE A WAY." VIP.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; THE VIP IS ON HIS WAY.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; it says, "They that wait upon the Lord
[1:17:51] shall renew their strength."
[1:17:54] So in 2026,
[1:17:56] may God renew your strength.
[1:18:00] MAY GOD RENEW YOUR STRENGTH IN THE WORD.
[1:18:04] OTHERS can leave the message. But you
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE HAS BECOME YOURSELF.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; CAN I GO FORWARD?
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDON,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU CONTINUE PREACHING HIS
[1:18:17] MESSAGE
[1:18:19] AFTER GOD TOOK YOUR WIFE AND YOUR
[1:18:21] CHILDREN?
[1:18:24] I'm not the ONE THAT KEEPS FOLLOWING THE
[1:18:27] MESSAGE IS following me.
[1:18:30] Even if I TRY TO TO RUN AWAY FROM IT,
[1:18:33] I'M CON I'M I'M BOUND TO IT
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; TO BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE.
[1:18:40] Brother Jesus said,
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; he told Judah,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; he said, Judas, you come from predition
[1:18:47] and you go back to predition,
[1:18:50] no matter what you're going to do,
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; you're going to go back to predition.
[1:18:55] Can I say that? Somebody here,
[1:18:58] they're they're condemned to go to
[1:19:00] heaven.
[1:19:04] If Judas was was bound TO TO HELL AND
[1:19:08] THEN THE SON OF GOD IS BOUND TO GO TO
[1:19:10] HEAVEN,
[1:19:12] NO MATTER what you're going to do,
[1:19:15] GOD HAS ALREADY SPOKEN.
[1:19:19] Brother Brown SAYS, "IF GOD SAYS, "I
[1:19:21] LOVE YOU,"
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; he can no longer change that.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; The number of my mistakes DO NOT CHANGE
[1:19:30] THE LOVE OF GOD TOWARD ME.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; You can laugh at me,
[1:19:36] thinking that I'm I'm nothing.
[1:19:39] You think I don't have enough money,
[1:19:42] but I have the most precious thing.
[1:19:46] I SEND AN ANGEL before you.
[1:19:49] I DON'T NEED TO FIGHT MYSELF.
[1:19:53] SUPERNATURAL
[1:19:55] HELP that's walking before me.
[1:19:58] Brother could talk ABOUT THIS AND THAT.
[1:20:01] HE SAYS IF HE doesn't come
[1:20:05] and we're going to go home
[1:20:07] AND EVERYTHING WILL STOP AND ALL OF A
[1:20:10] SUDDEN HE will stop AND HE'S HE'S GOING
[1:20:13] to say he's here.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I love to hear the taste.
[1:20:18] I love to hear WHEN BROTHER SAYS HE'S
[1:20:20] HERE. WHEN HE COMES he's
[1:20:24] then you can start REJOICING
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; because
[1:20:29] it was the END OF YOUR CANCER.
[1:20:32] YOU CAN START REJOICING.
[1:20:35] IT WAS BECAUSE it's the end of your
[1:20:36] sickness.
[1:20:40] Do you know that every time that light
[1:20:42] was was standing upon somebody,
[1:20:46] something good was happening to that
[1:20:47] person?
[1:20:49] But says when I see that that lights on
[1:20:52] on somebody,
[1:20:54] it was not there to curse him
[1:20:56] when God COMES TO HELP HIS CHILDREN.
[1:21:00] I pray in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; that the same God
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; that the angel of God
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; that he stands upon YOU
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; and that he sets you free.
[1:21:19] you can already start dancing
[1:21:22] because that's you you see I'm always
[1:21:24] happy
[1:21:26] because if something happens that means
[1:21:28] God wanted that thing to happen so then
[1:21:31] I said Lord
[1:21:33] what do you want to teach me
[1:21:37] because when you say Lord I want to SEE
[1:21:38] YOU I WANT TO SEE YOUERIENCE give me
[1:21:40] experiences
[1:21:43] God give experiences through trials
[1:21:47] so if you want EXPERIENCES
[1:21:49] THAT MEANS YOU WANT GOD TO GIVE YOU
[1:21:51] TRIALS. And I let me tell you
[1:21:55] try the trial is not there to kill you
[1:21:58] because he cannot give you some
[1:22:00] something that more than more than you
[1:22:03] can handle. So get yourself back
[1:22:05] together and start he start warming up.
[1:22:09] You know the story.
[1:22:11] Brother says, "I was standing on a tree
[1:22:15] and and the the and the storm caused the
[1:22:18] forced forced
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; forced the the the the the plane to come
[1:22:23] down the eagle to come down." The
[1:22:26] Brahman says, "I stopped.
[1:22:29] I was looking. He was not f far away
[1:22:30] from me."
[1:22:33] They say, "Do you know that if I get my
[1:22:35] gun, I can I CAN SHOOT."
[1:22:37] THE BROTHER SAYS THE EGO WAS LOOKING at
[1:22:39] him
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; and he was looking at him with such a
[1:22:42] confidence.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; The Brahman says as soon as I was about
[1:22:48] to get my hands on my god
[1:22:51] then I saw that he started raising his
[1:22:53] wings and he started rolling out.
[1:22:57] It's a way to say THAT BEFORE YOUR HANDS
[1:22:59] TOUCHES YOUR GAR
[1:23:01] I'LL BE GONE ALREADY.
[1:23:05] LET ME TELL YOU THAT THAT EAGLE is you.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; So then cheer
[1:23:13] tell your neighbor be of good cheer.
[1:23:17] The the Bible says a difficult life is
[1:23:19] is coming.
[1:23:23] But those that will know their God,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; they will do exploits.
[1:23:29] Do not wait for things to be easy
[1:23:32] because things will just get worse.
[1:23:36] But those that will know their god,
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; they will do exploits.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Exploits are things that you cannot
[1:23:45] imagine.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I want to give you this testimony.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I want to bother somebody here.
[1:23:54] a pastor, a friend of me,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; he had a he had an issues with his
[1:23:59] papers.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; He applied so they could readjust his
[1:24:05] status, but they they rejected it.
[1:24:09] So then they sent him a letter saying
[1:24:11] that you have to leave this the country
[1:24:13] in two weeks.
[1:24:17] Then in two weeks they send him a
[1:24:19] letter, you have to leave in 24 hours.
[1:24:23] that he was shaking.
[1:24:25] He was shaking.
[1:24:29] He got into a state of of despair.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Then he said then he said, "If God is
[1:24:36] God,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; then he has to do something for me."
[1:24:43] Now we we we we we we're afraid to
[1:24:45] challenge God. But God loves us to
[1:24:47] challenge.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; God loves us to CHALLENGE HIM.
[1:24:51] YOUR GOD IS A GOD OF CHALLENGES.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; So then he reapplied with his lawyer.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Then a week later they sent him a letter
[1:25:03] that your your case has been accepted.
[1:25:07] Why are you clapping your hands? I'm not
[1:25:09] done yet.
[1:25:10] Then it was in April. So that he was
[1:25:13] standing he was sitting there. He was
[1:25:15] hiding because of his status.
[1:25:18] because of ice
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; because of ice
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; and then it was April
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; September.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; In September
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; in the morning he woke up to look at his
[1:25:29] mail.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Then he saw two envelopes
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; USCIS
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; uh envelope from USCISvel.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Then he opens the first envelope.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; There's the work permit inside that that
[1:25:41] envelope.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Then he says, well then the second
[1:25:44] envelope, what is it talking about?
[1:25:46] Then he opens a second envelope.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; There's a green there's a green card
[1:25:50] inside that envelope.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; So, can I go forward?
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Then he calls me and he tells me about
[1:25:56] it.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Then I didn't even believe him.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, stop playing."
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Then he calls me FaceTime
[1:26:06] and he shows me the card.
[1:26:12] I didn't know what to say
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; that he says our God
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; answers prayers.
[1:26:21] [cheering]
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; So then if God is can do can do
[1:26:28] something FOR HIM
[1:26:30] THEN CAN he not do something for me.
[1:26:35] I pray that in 2026
[1:26:39] that God CLOSE THE CASE OF A LOT OF
[1:26:41] CHILDREN
[1:26:43] THAT GOD GOES AROUND THAT GOD BYPASS the
[1:26:47] procedures
[1:26:50] and that you receive a desire of your
[1:26:52] heart in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good. I have three three
[1:26:58] quotes
[1:27:00] and then we're going to go in prayer.
[1:27:04] AND GOD IS OBLIGATED TO COME down
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; because he he is the rewarder of those
[1:27:12] that seek that that seek after him.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; When you start you already start
[1:27:17] praying.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; When you start praying, God God is
[1:27:22] obligated to to um to reward you
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; because it's as if you you he owes you
[1:27:29] something. And brother Brahham says
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; that God will owe nobody anything.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; So then stop praying with fear.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, is this going to happen? God is
[1:27:44] looking at you. He's laughing.
[1:27:48] Say the word.
[1:27:51] The angel will fulfill what you said.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; May God help these people.
[1:28:01] Some people think we're talking about
[1:28:02] fables,
[1:28:05] but then when it's going to happen in
[1:28:06] your life, you're going to call
[1:28:08] yourself,
[1:28:10] you say, you're going to say, "God, God
[1:28:12] is alive.
[1:28:17] Does it does it not ren
[1:28:20] um revol revolt you every time you hear
[1:28:22] the prophet talk about those things?"
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Do you not ask yourself, "Where did this
[1:28:28] guy go? this this God
[1:28:32] I'm going to keep on going am I going to
[1:28:33] keep on going through this cycle
[1:28:36] am I can I never be DELIVERED
[1:28:40] SO that means everything I'm doing will
[1:28:42] will fail
[1:28:44] well then if that's the case then I'll
[1:28:46] go BACK IN THE WORLD
[1:28:48] so am I going to keep on this way
[1:28:52] a certain time you have to stop
[1:28:55] gideon
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; the angel appeared
[1:28:58] And he told him valor.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; A man of valor.
[1:29:04] Then he says, "What are you talking
[1:29:05] about? You call me man of valor."
[1:29:08] Yeah. Man of valor.
[1:29:11] You cannot call me A MAN OF VALOR.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; I'M HIDING EVERY TIME HERE. How am I a
[1:29:17] hero
[1:29:19] if God is God?
[1:29:22] Um I I want that a cloth
[1:29:27] that tomorrow when I come back here
[1:29:30] I want that all this place be dry
[1:29:34] that the that the the clothes be wet.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; So then it's Gideon who said if God is
[1:29:40] God then where are his miracles?
[1:29:45] The Christians here are JUST CONTENT
[1:29:46] WITH THE SAME THING. THEY DON'T GO
[1:29:49] FORWARD AND AND and they're happy.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; I came here to bother you this morning.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Are you happy with the little things?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; In the time of Jesus, Jesus could tell
[1:30:04] that woman.
[1:30:08] It was it was not good to give the
[1:30:10] children's bread to the to the dogs.
[1:30:13] But in this end time, the dogs became
[1:30:16] children.
[1:30:18] In the end time that the the the dogs
[1:30:20] DOGS DOGS BECAME CHILDREN.
[1:30:22] We we NO LONGER EAT.
[1:30:25] We eat on the table of the king.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; So then why SHOULD I KEEP ON EATING THE
[1:30:31] CRUMBS?
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; If God is God,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; if God is God,
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; if God is God,
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; he must do something for you.
[1:30:51] Jesus was angry at that man.
[1:30:54] He said, he said, "My son is sick."
[1:30:58] Can you do something for me? And Jesus
[1:31:01] looked at him. He said, "What you
[1:31:02] talking about? What do you mean? If you
[1:31:05] CAN
[1:31:07] you your faith, you have
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, I can do something for you."
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] So then God may God come help uh your
[1:31:17] faith.
[1:31:19] May God come help your faith.
[1:31:22] May God help your faith.
[1:31:26] Do you know brother says faith is a gift
[1:31:28] from God.
[1:31:31] And that faith that means you're
[1:31:32] anointed
[1:31:35] and that angel will anoint you.
[1:31:40] Billy Paul said that no matter the
[1:31:42] situation, brother Bren would never
[1:31:44] panic.
[1:31:47] [snorts]
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Because the angel told him that I will
[1:31:49] always be with you.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; So then why panic?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Why cry? WHY CRY? [screaming]
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; SPEAK.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; So then I'll read the sermon. the angel
[1:32:08] of God.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; "I would wish tonight
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; that everyone
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; would try to understand
[1:32:24] [screaming]
[1:32:25] closely the angel of the Lord
[1:32:30] and his great mission and work here on
[1:32:32] earth.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; So the angel is not jobless.
[1:32:36] He has a mission
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; to accomplish on this earth,
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; NOT IN HEAVEN, ON EARTH.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you that that mission
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; has something to do with humans.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to DO WITH THE WITH IT
[1:32:55] HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HUMANS.
[1:32:57] AMEN.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; I would love you to understand it the
[1:33:03] way I I I understand it.
[1:33:07] That's where you understand that
[1:33:11] when you realize what you have
[1:33:14] then it gives you a certain strength in
[1:33:16] prayer.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You can see what I nothing's working
[1:33:25] but then God is telling you that thing
[1:33:27] is working
[1:33:29] because true Christians are crazy
[1:33:31] people.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:33:36] Do you want to see the cra the crazy the
[1:33:37] full the craziness of OF CHRISTIANS?
[1:33:41] Do you want to see the craziness of
[1:33:43] Christians
[1:33:45] there? Do you want to see the craziness
[1:33:46] of Christians?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Then let's go forward.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[1:33:52] old
[1:33:54] and he called Eliser. He said come. He
[1:33:57] said my little Isaac here. He's gonna
[1:34:00] get married,
[1:34:02] but I don't want him to take to marry
[1:34:04] those pagans.
[1:34:06] I don't want him to marry pagans here.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Now, the brothers of the people to marry
[1:34:13] pagans. No, he told him, I don't want
[1:34:15] you to marry pagans here.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; He told him, "Go in my land."
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; And get a w a bride for my son
[1:34:25] that brothers, let's be honest.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; It's craziness.
[1:34:29] It's foolishness.
[1:34:32] Then
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Isaac has to come with me.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; No, Isaac is not going with you, dude.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; He's like me.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know Isaac's taste.
[1:34:46] Then do you know the answer of Abraham?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; He says, "The L the Lord that I serve
[1:34:52] will send an angel before thee.
[1:34:56] He will help you.
[1:34:58] to find a wife for for Isaac
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; in different terms.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; The tasks that you think is difficult
[1:35:09] will be made easy because the angel is
[1:35:11] before you.
[1:35:14] You think it's impossible.
[1:35:18] But let me tell you that me Abraham have
[1:35:19] things I've seen A LOT OF THINGS.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT I'M TELLING YOU is nothing for
[1:35:24] God.
[1:35:26] Abraham
[1:35:29] experiences of Abraham
[1:35:33] and knew that the God could send an
[1:35:35] angel to help Elar.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Elazar has never had an an experience
[1:35:40] with angels.
[1:35:42] Then Abraham told him, you're going to
[1:35:44] have an experience. Go.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; And Elazar was a faithful servant.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Then he got to the to the well
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Lord,
[1:35:56] I I'm I'm blocked here.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; But because your servant spoke,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; the the the the girl who's going to come
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; if I ask her to give me water
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; and that SHE GIVES ME WATER AND that by
[1:36:14] herself
[1:36:16] and that on her own if she gives water
[1:36:18] to the camels as well,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; then that's going to be the wife of
[1:36:21] Isaac. The Bible says
[1:36:26] He did not finish praying yet.
[1:36:30] And behold, Rebecca was coming. The
[1:36:34] question I'm going to ask you, who went
[1:36:36] to seek Rebecca?
[1:36:38] WHO WENT TO look for Rebecca?
[1:36:42] Who went TO LOOK FOR REBECCA?
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; ELEAZAR was praying.
[1:36:48] He was praying in his heart.
[1:36:51] He didn't even finish praying.
[1:36:54] Then the answer TO HIS PRAYER WAS
[1:36:56] ALREADY PRESENT WHO WENT TO LOOK FOR
[1:36:58] REBECCA.
[1:37:00] LET ME tell you that IT WAS THE ANGEL
[1:37:03] WHO WENT TO LOOK FOR REBECCA
[1:37:07] BECAUSE BROTHER SAYS GOD WORKS ON BOTH
[1:37:09] SIDES.
[1:37:11] Then he sees her. He says uh hey lady
[1:37:15] can you give me this water? My pleasure.
[1:37:17] My joy.
[1:37:22] She had no problem to serve to to to
[1:37:25] serve strangers to entertain to
[1:37:27] entertain strangers.
[1:37:31] She had no problem entertaining people
[1:37:33] that she didn't know.
[1:37:36] But then us here, we can't even help pe
[1:37:38] the brothers that we know.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; SHAME. SHAME on us.
[1:37:46] Then here's water. Then she looks
[1:37:51] then strangely she knew
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; that if this MAN WAS WAS THIRSTY
[1:37:57] THAT MEANS his camels would also be
[1:37:58] thirsty.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So then she said I will give WATER TO MY
[1:38:02] CAMELS. THEN LEAR [screaming]
[1:38:04] JUMPED. HE SAID LORD GOD THIS IS MY
[1:38:06] PRAYER.
[1:38:09] My prayer is about to be fulfilled
[1:38:10] before me.
[1:38:13] I DIDN'T I HAVEN'T EVEN
[1:38:15] THEN here she is there.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; So then I like the comments that brother
[1:38:21] Brham made.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; "Brother Brandham says,
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; are you ready?"
[1:38:32] In the sermon, the time a time the time
[1:38:34] of decision,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said,
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; it was it was in the evening time
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; that he got to the well
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; near the city.
[1:38:50] It was around that time
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; that Rebecca made a decision. Let's go.
[1:39:01] I believe that the angel went before her
[1:39:03] there
[1:39:06] around half an hour before
[1:39:11] 30 minutes before JESUS GOT THERE.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; BEFORE Elizer Elizer got there,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; the angel went to look for Rebecca
[1:39:22] because you she has she had to walk.
[1:39:25] The Bible says in a half hour.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; So, so then let's read right here.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; For me,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; in fact,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; he will send his angels
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; before you
[1:39:46] may they may make the way clear.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; It must have been the angel of God.
[1:39:55] that spoke to Rebecca's heart.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "GO GET WATER."
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, the brothers of Rebecca didn't hear
[1:40:05] the voice of the angel.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; It was only Rebecca who heard the voice
[1:40:09] of the angel.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; So that means for you to hear to listen
[1:40:12] to the voice of the angel. You have to
[1:40:14] be a Rebecca.
[1:40:17] The angel only speaks to Rebecca.
[1:40:21] So and Leo was was was amaz
[1:40:36] so how does this concern us brother says
[1:40:41] he said it's not my job
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; to convince you that the message is the
[1:40:46] truth
[1:40:48] it's the angel who goes before
[1:40:50] Hallelujah.
[1:40:53] Brother says it's not my job
[1:40:55] to convince you that this message comes
[1:40:57] from it's the job of the angel.
[1:41:02] Moses could not convince ALL THOSE
[1:41:03] PEOPLE.
[1:41:05] HE FAILED HIMSELF.
[1:41:09] So then how is it THAT THE SECOND TIME
[1:41:10] WHEN HE COMES BACK THAT PEOPLE BELIEVED
[1:41:13] IN?
[1:41:15] SO THAT MEANS THAT BEFORE MOSES GOT
[1:41:16] THERE, the angel wine WENT THERE BEFORE
[1:41:19] MOSES
[1:41:21] to convince the hearts of the PEOPLE
[1:41:24] AND TO harden the hearts of Pharaoh.
[1:41:28] John the Baptist could not convince God.
[1:41:31] BUT BEFORE JOHN THE BAPTIST GOT THERE,
[1:41:34] Gabriel came down
[1:41:36] to prepare the way for him.
[1:41:44] That's what makes a difference between
[1:41:45] the message and denominations.
[1:41:48] I don't have time to to read. Brother
[1:41:51] Brham says
[1:41:54] he says people criticize me for the
[1:41:55] GIFTS THAT I HAVE TOLD ME THAT THIS GIFT
[1:41:58] COMES from the devil. Then brother
[1:42:00] Brandham says he says I made a decision
[1:42:04] that if God does not meet me I will
[1:42:07] never come back here.
[1:42:09] Now, brother, it's in that kind of
[1:42:11] situation that God is going to meet you.
[1:42:14] Brother says he wasn't he wasn't he was
[1:42:16] praying
[1:42:18] in around two hours
[1:42:21] a light a big light shone
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; and from that light right there a man
[1:42:29] came out of that LIGHT
[1:42:32] brother says he I I could hear I COULD
[1:42:35] HEAR HIM WALK.
[1:42:37] HE SAYS I STARTED shaking
[1:42:40] but when he spoke he says fear not
[1:42:46] says it's THE VOICE THAT I ALWAYS heard
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; since I was a CHILD
[1:42:51] now I could see his face
[1:42:55] to GO
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; I CAME TO TELL you
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; that the things that you see happen in
[1:43:04] your life they come from ARE
[1:43:09] because you have a mission TO ACCOMPLISH
[1:43:11] ON EARTH. Brother says, well, I don't
[1:43:15] have any education.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I can't stand before all these
[1:43:20] theologians.
[1:43:22] Then he says, don't worry.
[1:43:25] The infalluable presence of God,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; brother. The infalluable presence.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; The infalluable presence.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; The infalluable presence.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; The infalluable presence
[1:43:42] of God WILL BE WITH YOU IN DIFFERENT
[1:43:45] TERMS.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I will be with you.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; So who's the angel of God?
[1:43:52] LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE ANGEL OF GOD IS
[1:43:55] THE HOLY Spirit
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; who comes down in the form of an angel.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; It's God
[1:44:03] who becomes a SERVANTS FOR HIS PEOPLE.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; HE SAID GOD himself
[1:44:09] will become A SERVANTS FOR HIS PEOPLE.
[1:44:12] IT'S NOT A WORSHIP OF AN ANGEL,
[1:44:15] BUT IT'S A RECOGNITION
[1:44:18] OF ANGELS OF GOD WHO WALK before you.
[1:44:22] So you can BE HEALED.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; ANGELS OF GOD WHO WALK BEFORE YOU
[1:44:29] SO YOU CAN RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; THE ANGELS OF GOD,

[1:44:46] angels of God, [screaming] THEY WALK
[1:44:48] BEFORE YOU
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN OVERCOME TEMPTATION.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus was weak.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; But but the Bible says an ANGEL APPEARED
[1:44:58] UNTO HIM.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE says an angel appeared unto
[1:45:01] him
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; to strengthen him.
[1:45:06] I pray that the same angel who
[1:45:08] strengthened Jesus
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; that that angel comes down this morning
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; and that HE STRENGTHENS YOU.
[1:45:15] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; I pray that that same angel
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; that he touches your children.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; I PRAY THAT THE same angel
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; that he breaks your chain
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; AND THAT YOU START SAYING
[1:45:32] THAT THAT
[1:45:37] A SPECIAL EDITION
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; BREAKING NEWS
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; BREAKING NEWS.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I WAS SICK
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; AND NOW I'M HEALED.
[1:45:44] I WAS BOUND.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; AND NOW I'M DELIVERED.
[1:45:49] I
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; I I was feeling I was I WAS HURT
[1:45:54] and and and all and AND IT LEFT ME.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I WAS BARREN
[1:45:59] AND GOD GAVE ME CHILDREN.
[1:46:02] I I HAD headache
[1:46:05] and the headache disappeared.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; I was looking FOR A JOB
[1:46:10] AND GOD GAVE ME A JOB.
[1:46:13] I WANTED TO ADD PEPPERS
[1:46:15] THAT GOD gave me.
[1:46:18] And let me tell you,
[1:46:20] the angel will accomplish that for me.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; So, let's stand.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; I'll read a a quote and then we'll
[1:46:28] finish.
[1:46:30] GOD IS ALIVE.
[1:46:33] GOD is alive.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; God is alive.
[1:46:37] In 2026,
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; God will close the mouth
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; of of Waters.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; God will close the mouth of critics.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; So, let's read this quote
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; and we'll finish.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; ARE WE ARE YOU READY?
[1:46:57] Are you ready?
[1:46:59] Are you ready?
[1:47:02] Brother Brandham says
[1:47:06] in the sermon from the beginning it
[1:47:07] wasn't so
[1:47:10] in the the the
[1:47:13] paragraph 28
[1:47:16] I love this quote
[1:47:19] brother says
[1:47:21] then today
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; they have the nerve to say
[1:47:28] people are wondering
[1:47:32] What happened to the God OF THE BIBLE?
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Where is that God?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:47:43] YOU CHOKED HIM OUT BY YOUR CREEDS.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; You've choked him out by your
[1:47:49] traditions.
[1:47:53] You've tried to place him back in
[1:47:55] history.
[1:47:58] He's the god of history.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Reverence says when Moses called on
[1:48:04] called on him
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; in in in the Red Sea,
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; the God of history rose
[1:48:13] and he made a way.
[1:48:16] WHEN JOSHUA CALLED HIM,
[1:48:20] the God of history rose
[1:48:23] and he made a way.
[1:48:26] Faith comes from hearing
[1:48:28] and hearing from the word.
[1:48:31] When Daniel called him
[1:48:35] in the lion's den,
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; if I refer to say he made a way,
[1:48:43] brother Brown SAYS HE'S THE SAME GOD of
[1:48:45] history
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; and he's waiting.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; He's waiting.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; He's waiting.
[1:48:55] He's waiting.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; He's waiting.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; He's waiting for his people
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; to call him out of history.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; GOD is waiting that for you
[1:49:10] to call him out of history.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; That same God
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; remains God.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; That same GOD
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; remains God.
[1:49:23] by our traditions,
[1:49:26] we've taught them away from the people.
[1:49:30] What we must do
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; is BRING
[1:49:37] that living faith back to the people
[1:49:41] to bring BACK GOD TO BRING GOD BACK TO
[1:49:44] THE PEOPLE.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; So then if you have a need, raise your
[1:49:48] hand.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Raise your hands.
[1:49:52] God will God will act this this morning.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to pray for you.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; You're going to open your mouth
[1:50:02] and say say the hour has come.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; It's either you're God or you're not
[1:50:09] God.
[1:50:11] So then we'll read the last sermon, the
[1:50:13] last quote, then we'll start praying.
[1:50:16] Reverb says in faith,
[1:50:18] he says the last quote in faith.
[1:50:23] If the blessings placed on you,
[1:50:26] then hold still.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's days before he can get to
[1:50:33] you.
[1:50:35] BROTHER SAYS, "DANIEL PRAYED ONE time
[1:50:40] and the angel didn't get to HIM FOR 21
[1:50:42] DAYS."
[1:50:44] Brother says, "Is that right?"
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "I've seen the time.
[1:50:52] where women and men would wait for weeks
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; and the first thing you know
[1:50:59] ALL AT ONCE
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; IT happened
[1:51:05] the angel passing through the
[1:51:07] neighborhood
[1:51:10] because brother spoke the words of
[1:51:13] blessing on him
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; then the angel had to make sure that
[1:51:18] those that those words will
[1:51:21] So the angel was passing through the
[1:51:22] neighborhood
[1:51:24] as your hands. The angel knows your
[1:51:26] home.
[1:51:28] This gives me joy
[1:51:30] to know that when Jacob
[1:51:34] wanted to give inheritance to his
[1:51:35] children.
[1:51:37] He he didn't he didn't give them money.
[1:51:41] HE WAS NOT GIVING THEM a home. He said,
[1:51:44] "Sit down
[1:51:46] and I'll tell you what's going to happen
[1:51:48] to you.
[1:51:49] Brother Bronam says
[1:51:52] he said Jacob said pronounced words
[1:51:57] and what he would say
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; is what was happening
[1:52:02] brother says a true blessing is not
[1:52:05] material blessing
[1:52:07] but it's the word
[1:52:10] God in the soul
[1:52:12] because the word can create money the
[1:52:15] word can set free the word can deliver
[1:52:20] the word can give the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:23] The word on your feet,
[1:52:26] the word standing on two feet,
[1:52:30] the the word standing on two feet has
[1:52:33] more power
[1:52:35] than the word in the book.
[1:52:38] The word that's driving the car has more
[1:52:41] power
[1:52:43] than the word that's in the book. And
[1:52:46] that word is you. Brother says, "THE
[1:52:50] HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY. BUT
[1:52:52] THE WORD WILL never pass away."
[1:52:55] He said, "How can the word not pass
[1:52:56] away?"
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; When the word gets your feet, then you
[1:53:01] will NEVER PASS AWAY. SO RAISE YOUR
[1:53:03] VOICE.
[1:53:05] IF GOD IS GOD,
[1:53:07] THEN HE HAS TO ACT.
[1:53:10] Whoever says he's OBLIGATED TO. SO THEN
[1:53:13] STOP PRAYING TO THE Lord
[1:53:16] and God will do for you.
[1:53:19] He says if the people
[1:53:22] that my name are where my name is called
[1:53:26] if those who are called BY MY NAME ARE
[1:53:28] TURN turn away from from from my my
[1:53:31] voice
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; and that they they that they that they
[1:53:35] they speak to me
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; then from heavens
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; I will answer your prayers.
[1:53:42] So let me tell you,
[1:53:45] I thank thee because you've already
[1:53:47] answered.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Because God always answers to your
[1:53:51] prayers.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; God always answers your prayers.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; So then speak to your Lord.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; SPEAK TO YOUR LORD.
[1:54:00] GO GET UP.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; GET UP. THE BIBLE says
[1:54:06] we we sing the song lift me high
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:54:10] and let me stand.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Speak to you Lord.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; God is here TO TOUCH YOU.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; GOD IS HERE
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; TO SET YOU FREE.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS I came
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; so the captives can be made freeclaim.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; I came to proclaim
[1:54:33] a year of juba of deliverance.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; So then tell God the hour has come
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; where I have to be delivered.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Am I going TO CONTINUE THIS WAY
[1:54:45] to continue in failures
[1:54:51] continue in despair
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; while God exists
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; and I know that God exists.
[1:54:58] So then if God exists,
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; then he must act for me.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; He has to act for me,
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; he has to act for me.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; So Lord Jesus,
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; act for your people.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Act for your people.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; What what what a glory.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; You know that we we were once slaves,
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; slaves of sin,
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; but a great God.
[1:55:28] took a pleasure to to redeem us. He
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; he took pleasure TO SET US FREE. HE
[1:55:34] LOVED us
[1:55:36] when WE DIDN'T LOVE OURSELVES so that
[1:55:42] he has to take care of you.
[1:55:45] Brother Brham says,
[1:55:48] "Man was not created to do things on his
[1:55:50] own.
[1:55:52] Man was not created to do things.
[1:55:57] Man was created so God can take care of
[1:55:59] us.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; So that's why brother Brandon preached
[1:56:02] he care.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; So you're a son of God.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[1:56:11] Just ask what you want
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; and it will be fulfilled.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; God delivers his people.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; God answers prayers.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; God touches his children.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; God delivers the hearts.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; God can change YOUR HEART OF STONE TO A
[1:56:41] HEART OF FLESH.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; And he can put your his spirit
[1:56:47] in your soul.
[1:56:49] So raise your voice to God in 2026.
[1:56:54] It's the year of testimonies
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; that it's what God is going to do
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; in your life,
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; in my life.
[1:57:04] Let's pray the Lord.
[1:58:30] Hallelujah.
[1:59:22] The gravey.
[1:59:26] We
[1:59:28] shall
