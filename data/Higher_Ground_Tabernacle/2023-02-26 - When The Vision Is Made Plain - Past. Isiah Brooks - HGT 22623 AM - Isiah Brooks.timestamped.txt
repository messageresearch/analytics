[58:30] for he that's in these excuse me for he
[58:33] that in these things serveth Christ

[58:49] so those who serve God in the Kingdom
[58:54] is acceptable
[58:57] to God that means god accepts you see

[59:03] and approved of men Hallelujah
[59:07] [Music]

[59:14] 22-24.
[59:25] and Jesus answering said unto them have
[59:29] faith in God Jesus
[59:34] severely I say it to you
[59:37] that whosoever shall say unto this
[59:39] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[59:43] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[59:46] his heart but shall believe that those
[59:49] things which he saith shall come to pass
[59:52] he shall have whatsoever he said
[1:00:06] therefore I say unto you
[1:00:09] what things soever ye desire When you
[1:00:12] pray believe that you received them and
[1:00:17] ye shall have them
[1:00:25] let us pray father God we come before
[1:00:29] you Lord
[1:00:32] we thank you for being so good
[1:00:36] Lord I pray this morning
[1:00:39] revive this service
[1:00:49] that's why we come to church
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:01:01] amen amen you may be seated
[1:01:05] hmm
[1:01:08] amen amen
[1:01:11] it was once hot now it's cool
[1:01:14] but I thank God for his grace
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:25] but by the grace of God I am comfortable
[1:01:28] in the Holy Spirit
[1:01:33] I like to uh entitle this message
[1:01:36] when the vision is made plain
[1:01:42] you know the book the word of God tells
[1:01:45] us
[1:01:46] that without a vision
[1:01:49] uh the people parents
[1:01:52] and we understand
[1:01:55] the Bible is one big Vision
[1:01:59] something that God reveals to his people
[1:02:04] in order to serve him
[1:02:06] you see God
[1:02:09] but God
[1:02:11] be adds to add
[1:02:13] to attitude Hallelujah
[1:02:17] amen he's the god that continually
[1:02:20] unveil himself
[1:02:23] I mean we cannot comprehend god
[1:02:27] without a finite Minds
[1:02:31] so the Lord has to come down to our
[1:02:34] level
[1:02:36] he has the condensation
[1:02:40] the god of the universe The God Who made
[1:02:44] all things
[1:02:49] you think about it
[1:02:51] we can't even comprehend the performance
[1:02:54] how the Sun stays in place
[1:02:59] stays in place
[1:03:04] and just to think it's just nothing is
[1:03:08] out of order
[1:03:10] the thing is
[1:03:17] how much we might think the things yes
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:27] we're living in a horrible Society
[1:03:30] but it is in order
[1:03:33] why because God prophesied
[1:03:37] through the through the uh uh gospels
[1:03:40] by way of the Old Testament
[1:03:44] he told us that this day would come in
[1:03:48] this day
[1:03:51] lovers of pleasure
[1:03:54] of God
[1:03:59] now we see
[1:04:02] our own eyes
[1:04:04] I can't understand
[1:04:07] people still want
[1:04:09] to watch Hallelujah
[1:04:16] we hate the word of God
[1:04:19] because the Bible says
[1:04:26] I want to say this think about it the
[1:04:31] Bible has all of your answers to your
[1:04:33] questions
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:45] it tickles me a little bit you know
[1:04:47] because men think basketballs that
[1:04:51] they're smarter than God
[1:04:54] hallelujah now you can believe that you
[1:04:57] came from a monkey
[1:05:06] Deadpool
[1:05:08] um anyway yeah let's say frog
[1:05:14] he doesn't know how to interpret that
[1:05:15] word
[1:05:16] and I don't know how to tell him
[1:05:19] but the point is
[1:05:22] there is an evolution yeah in evolution
[1:05:25] but it's not according to science
[1:05:29] God has an evolution
[1:05:33] but it's not based on the laws of
[1:05:36] science
[1:05:37] it's based on the spoken word
[1:05:41] when God said let there be
[1:05:46] bring forth
[1:05:48] Our Kind
[1:05:53] s
[1:05:56] every time they get to that point
[1:06:00] they destroyed themselves
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:04] I'm just going to give you a just a
[1:06:06] small example
[1:06:08] word of God
[1:06:10] in the last days
[1:06:13] this is a day of high breeding
[1:06:17] the cows
[1:06:19] they have breed the chicken
[1:06:23] they have breed the corn the the Maize
[1:06:26] whatever they can hybrid
[1:06:29] they do it you do phone it may be
[1:06:32] prettier
[1:06:40] sometimes those pieces so big we won't
[1:06:43] eat them
[1:06:45] but that comes from high breeding
[1:06:48] it's what I want to excuse me what I
[1:06:50] want to say is
[1:06:52] that according to the prophet of God
[1:06:54] every time you high breed something
[1:06:57] right
[1:07:03] that's why we all you know what I'm
[1:07:05] saying we we go and we work out
[1:07:13] those cows
[1:07:17] and like they say the comedies you are
[1:07:20] what you eat
[1:07:21] right you can't help it in America
[1:07:24] everybody
[1:07:35] folks that's the truth
[1:07:37] but it doesn't give us life
[1:07:42] it brings diabetes
[1:07:56] to process
[1:07:59] strange food
[1:08:03] I'm just saying that I'm working with a
[1:08:07] spiritual aspect
[1:08:09] because the bride of Christ
[1:08:19] we don't want me to
[1:09:07] Hallelujah the glory of the Lord
[1:09:21] Hallelujah because in this last days
[1:09:24] foreign
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:50] and so it's not the man but it's the
[1:09:54] force behind the man
[1:09:56] not behind the man
[1:09:58] Christ that is
[1:10:03] and these men and they are part of the
[1:10:07] Kingdom
[1:10:09] Hallelujah they do Kingdom things
[1:10:14] because I'm trying to give you a vision
[1:10:17] so that you can understand
[1:10:20] that we're not called to the Lutheran
[1:10:24] anointing
[1:10:26] call to the Wesleyan knows
[1:10:39] and that anointing is there for us

[1:10:48] claims to be a Christian
[1:10:50] will not Embrace this anointing
[1:10:54] is here
[1:10:57] at the opening of the word
[1:11:02] amen we came to
[1:11:23] he called her bone

[1:11:31] lightness
[1:11:37] in this last day
[1:11:39] looking for church
[1:11:45] I'm not talking about a Baptist Church
[1:12:01] you understand me because all Israel is
[1:12:05] not Israel
[1:12:08] certain group of people is
[1:12:20] special class of people
[1:12:25] by his foreign
[1:12:35] [Music]

[1:12:56] of ways

[1:13:29] I do not want anybody
[1:13:35] systematic worship
[1:13:39] you must be born again
[1:13:49] lead us not into temptation
[1:13:52] but Deliver Us from Evil
[1:13:55] now I don't know whether you feel that
[1:13:57] way but that's what I like
[1:14:00] allow me to be enter into temptation
[1:14:05] but Deliver Us from Evil
[1:14:08] this is what I like
[1:14:12] growth
[1:14:20] inside of me Omar is that right the
[1:14:24] Bible says
[1:14:30] God dwelling once a month in human
[1:14:34] foreign
[1:14:49] foreign
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:15:00] yes when you come to God you must give
[1:15:05] him all of us
[1:15:08] you say what do you mean brother Rooks I
[1:15:12] haven't even gotten to my notes yet
[1:15:16] too many Rich Young rulers
[1:15:23] in the message Hallelujah
[1:15:32] Lord I
[1:15:34] do all of these things
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:43] have you been born again
[1:15:46] that's the question because see really
[1:15:49] Jesus said to the Rich Young rulers
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:16:21] cream of the clock they look like like
[1:16:24] he said I'm a real dude
[1:16:30] he said and in my life
[1:16:33] you couldn't find one pouch
[1:16:36] it was perfect
[1:16:39] Hallelujah but you see he had a
[1:16:42] religious spirit
[1:16:45] he was used to serving God according to
[1:16:48] the Jewish customs
[1:16:52] remember because what happened then
[1:16:54] when he met Jesus
[1:16:57] God took him off that high horse
[1:17:10] if you talk to God do you talk back to
[1:17:13] you
[1:17:16] God will speak back
[1:17:21] oh
[1:17:31] but Jesus was connecting himself to his
[1:17:35] people
[1:17:37] his people's name was Jesus Jesus
[1:17:54] Paul had to change
[1:17:58] there's a Time Paul said the good that I
[1:18:00] would do yeah
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:03] I find not the way to do it
[1:18:07] but the evil
[1:18:10] I find a way to do it you understand me
[1:18:13] he said there's a law within me
[1:18:16] there's a law of Life there is a law of
[1:18:20] death
[1:18:22] but he said Thank be to God
[1:18:27] and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:18:37] Hallelujah
[1:18:39] so no matter our grandpa how we feel
[1:18:42] within ourselves
[1:18:44] always recognize
[1:18:47] the word of God
[1:18:49] hallelujah amen it's something how it
[1:18:52] quickens you yeah
[1:18:57] God has a way of making connections
[1:19:04] how many of you who how many of you has
[1:19:07] uh out here that has the Holy Ghost
[1:19:11] explain it to me
[1:19:14] there's no way to explain it and if you
[1:19:18] can't explain it you don't have it
[1:19:22] but you know once you get it
[1:19:27] something happened foreign
[1:19:56] [Applause]
[1:21:05] Hallelujah and that's that is really
[1:21:08] important it's important because we're
[1:21:10] coming into a time
[1:21:13] God will use individuals
[1:21:21] speaking the word
[1:21:25] foreign
[1:21:35] how is going to all happening
[1:21:40] I believe the word of God
[1:21:46] Hebrews 13 and 8. the Bible said Jesus
[1:21:50] Christ the same yesterday
[1:21:53] that means God does not change
[1:21:57] and what he did yesterday
[1:22:02] hallelujah how many of you believe
[1:22:05] Jesus Christ what's the fullness of the
[1:22:08] godhead father
[1:22:15] Jesus Christ is the creator
[1:22:18] Hallelujah the Bible says according to
[1:22:22] Saint John
[1:22:23] Hallelujah in the beginning was the word
[1:22:26] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:22:30] gone
[1:22:31] that word
[1:22:35] Belgium as the only begotten of the
[1:22:37] father
[1:22:47] Jesus Christ
[1:22:50] somebody said well he wasn't he wasn't
[1:22:53] he wasn't even here hallelujah
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:07] and listen when God began to use a
[1:23:10] person
[1:23:11] go to the king Palace
[1:23:17] he doesn't go to the governors
[1:23:35] why because God grows how to clean up
[1:23:39] America
[1:23:53] like it was in the Book of Genesis
[1:24:00] that's what he does to the seed of God
[1:24:05] Hallelujah
[1:24:25] the world might call me a prostitute
[1:24:30] but Jesus says
[1:24:41] [Applause]
[1:24:46] [Music]
[1:25:07] sheep here is my voice foreign
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:09] Hallelujah
[1:26:15] we come to a place
[1:26:18] we're not just Christians Hallelujah
[1:26:24] where the word made flashlights
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:39] the kingdom is not out here
[1:26:43] in Wyoming he's in here that's why it
[1:26:46] brings peace
[1:26:57] Christians don't have jobs
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:25] hallelujah oh yes
[1:27:28] amen oh yes
[1:27:30] I love this word
[1:27:34] Jesus Jesus through all his ministries
[1:27:48] what to expect
[1:27:50] even in the animal kingdom anymore the
[1:27:53] animals teaches their young wine
[1:28:32] see see because we don't have a
[1:28:34] revelation of what he said
[1:28:38] if I didn't have God I'd forget my own
[1:28:40] name sometimes
[1:28:44] but the truth of the matter is
[1:28:47] when he talked about that
[1:28:51] he wasn't dealing with your flesh
[1:28:54] he was dealing with your teeth
[1:28:58] the body that God gave you
[1:29:01] before the fall I've wanna shoot them
[1:29:05] and in your theophany you know all
[1:29:08] things
[1:29:10] that's why Adam
[1:29:14] she was made with his theophany
[1:29:24] but just like the problem

[1:39:18] foreign
[1:39:47] absolutely why absolutely
[1:39:53] coming from the
[1:39:54] message Hallelujah
[1:39:57] he said after receiving the Holy Spirit
[1:40:00] God made the whole world out of nothing
[1:40:08] his word is creation
[1:40:13] was created
[1:40:17] that's what gets me let me just take it
[1:40:21] when it comes to a a horse
[1:40:24] let me use the dog the smart
[1:40:28] um
[1:40:29] a dog never have to go to school to
[1:40:31] learn how to bark Luciano
[1:40:34] boy a dog never left never have to go to
[1:40:37] school to learn how to bite
[1:40:43] that dog knows his mama
[1:40:49] it's man is we're the Fallen creatures
[1:40:54] we gotta learn how to talk
[1:40:56] and understand what we're talking about
[1:40:59] we have to learn how to walk divorce
[1:41:02] when they give birth
[1:41:04] especially to a horse
[1:41:10] you understand me those laws work with
[1:41:14] those kind of animals
[1:41:16] but there is a law of God
[1:41:20] each seed bring forth of its
[1:41:23] kindness you'll never find a horse
[1:41:36] in space
[1:41:37] because
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:36] we're all growing
[1:42:38] but never lose your vision
[1:42:44] is that right Abraham see
[1:42:47] Abraham never lost his vision
[1:42:52] amen he didn't look for shitty he shall
[1:42:55] shout out to Winfield and maker with God
[1:42:58] he knew that you really existed
[1:43:00] because he met melchized
[1:43:05] Hallelujah and he knew my character that
[1:43:08] was a prince
[1:43:19] foreign
[1:43:37] and go down to Babylon Babylon look down
[1:43:41] there amen and and when uh Shadrach
[1:43:44] Meshach and abilities
[1:43:52] so I'm just going to say that's why
[1:43:55] people can't see God
[1:43:58] especially in human being
[1:44:01] because we're like badgers
[1:44:05] we're like that
[1:44:07] you know and people would especially if
[1:44:10] they know if they knew you as a sinner
[1:44:14] Christian now
[1:44:16] you can't comprehend God behind you
[1:44:19] don't know how bad you used to be
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:25] thank you Lord that's how they look at
[1:44:27] Jesus you're taking any good thing come
[1:44:30] out of Nazarene foreign
[1:44:44] with the Roman soldier
[1:44:48] so he
[1:44:50] is why the Jew said do you think
[1:44:56] because in their mind Jesus
[1:45:04] hello
[1:45:05] so they couldn't see the Messiah
[1:45:07] he was likened to the badger skin
[1:45:11] there was no Beauty
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:47] and I noticed
[1:46:04] as a complete
[1:46:07] and it comes to pass just like you said
[1:46:09] it is
[1:46:21] that the spoken word is possible
[1:46:27] so so I said 172. you see when you speak
[1:46:32] anything
[1:46:34] good to you to us
[1:46:38] speak it till we believe it
[1:46:41] we believe it
[1:46:45] and that creative words
[1:46:58] what I'm trying to say is let's come to
[1:47:01] a place
[1:47:06] I'm bringing that issue to you this
[1:47:09] morning
[1:47:12] you must come to know
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:19] that mainly that means you believe
[1:47:21] everyone every all of the words
[1:47:26] Hallelujah is that right if you if you
[1:47:29] are see ing
[1:47:32] you believe to know the Holy Ghost is
[1:47:33] necessary
[1:47:38] you believe that Jesus Christ
[1:47:42] does not change Jesus Christ
[1:47:56] we came to be sons and goddess of God
[1:48:05] that Jesus is Alive and Well
[1:48:09] I'm not talking about singing and
[1:48:12] dancing
[1:48:21] but I came to with power
[1:48:30] Hallelujah
[1:48:31] elephant
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:40] you can give your body to be burned
[1:48:43] corporate bully you can feed the poor
[1:48:46] do all the religious things
[1:48:51] but you must have the Holy ghosts
[1:48:55] that is your Saving Grace
[1:49:10] he said I'm sure you all could see what
[1:49:13] it is it is
[1:49:19] see what it is
[1:49:21] coming of a greater
[1:49:24] deeper anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:49:35] I don't know
[1:49:37] the only thing I know
[1:49:39] it takes God to put you into it take it
[1:49:43] foreign
[1:50:24] Hallelujah
[1:50:27] just remember
[1:50:29] you are
[1:50:32] the dove
[1:50:35] is
[1:50:39] the same nature is
[1:50:43] the most gentlest of all the birds of
[1:50:46] the heaven
[1:50:47] is
[1:50:50] the most interest of all the beasts of
[1:50:53] the earth
[1:50:57] so you see the spirit would coincide
[1:51:02] with one another this is
[1:51:04] hallelujah that's like when Jesus was
[1:51:07] being baptized
[1:51:13] Hallelujah in order for the dove to come
[1:51:16] down
[1:51:19] it can't be a wolf
[1:51:24] um
[1:51:25] the dove could not come on the wolf
[1:51:29] see it wouldn't stay there
[1:51:33] the wolf is a killer
[1:51:37] the lamb is gentle
[1:51:41] is that all right so why give me one
[1:51:43] more scripture
[1:51:47] you love the Lord now there's more to be
[1:51:50] said
[1:51:51] last week I preached the higher calling
[1:51:55] bringing you to a place where you can
[1:51:57] see
[1:52:01] to come into this
[1:52:05] it takes God to train you before me like
[1:52:09] 80 years when God trained Moses
[1:52:16] you train you almost all your life just
[1:52:19] to just to serve one purpose for me
[1:52:22] Hallelujah
[1:52:26] don't be discussed discourage at your
[1:52:28] mistakes and your faults
[1:52:35] hallelujah amen you love the Lord
[1:52:43] natural
[1:52:44] you know I'ma say it like this
[1:52:49] the natural man has to die
[1:52:54] yeah yeah every day
[1:52:58] is that right Paul said I died daily
[1:53:02] even when we make our mistakes
[1:53:05] we kill him today
[1:53:08] tomorrow we let him rise again
[1:53:12] you love the Lord is she
[1:53:16] a lot of times people don't understand
[1:53:20] how how do you
[1:53:23] I wonder what they
[1:53:25] with Paul said and follow me as I follow
[1:53:27] Christ
[1:53:30] they would have looked at him like a
[1:53:32] culture
[1:53:36] oh they looked at John that way
[1:53:39] they look at Jesus
[1:53:42] Jesus had 12 disciples
[1:53:46] their families
[1:53:51] and they following Jesus Jesus don't
[1:53:55] have no way to lay his head
[1:53:58] Jesus Christ
[1:54:02] you know you look at these and I I hate
[1:54:05] to say it but I'ma say it these
[1:54:07] Hollywood churches
[1:54:11] and the Bible speaks against all of that
[1:54:13] yeah okay
[1:54:34] my watch
[1:54:36] poster
[1:54:38] and set upon the towel
[1:54:41] and we'll watch to see what he will say
[1:54:44] unto me
[1:54:46] what I shall answer when I am approved
[1:54:49] is
[1:54:51] you know what I know
[1:54:54] the message in itself has been spoken
[1:54:56] evil of the message
[1:54:59] since I've been in this message
[1:55:07] in all manner of disease
[1:55:11] yes it's true there was a brother never
[1:55:16] met him
[1:55:17] but his father met me in the United
[1:55:20] States
[1:55:22] was born with some kind of retardation
[1:55:27] pray for that guys
[1:55:33] now our brother Danny I think Danny told
[1:55:36] me he knows
[1:55:38] I think it was brother Daly that told me
[1:55:43] I never met the man
[1:55:45] nobody can't tell me what he can't do
[1:55:50] nobody can tell cannot tell me what God
[1:55:53] can yes
[1:56:13] just in this church
[1:56:15] how many times we had these bad storms
[1:56:19] coming our way
[1:56:23] yeah and we wanted to have church
[1:56:28] and the storm dissipated
[1:56:32] and the news people said we don't know
[1:56:34] what happened
[1:56:38] but the prayer of a righteous man
[1:56:42] there's only one person we're here to
[1:56:45] glorify yeah
[1:56:54] you love the Lord
[1:56:58] second verse
[1:57:01] and the Lord said unto me
[1:57:06] and the Lord answered me excuse me
[1:57:09] write the vision make it plain upon
[1:57:13] tables
[1:57:14] that he may run that readeth it I think
[1:57:18] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:57:20] time
[1:57:30] because it will surely come it's a
[1:57:34] computer and it will not care yes
[1:57:44] so many things
[1:57:50] you don't have to be a rich and mighty
[1:57:53] in this world
[1:57:55] being great in the sight of God
[1:57:59] you have to be humble in your heart
[1:58:03] God calls that greatness
[1:58:06] he that's great enough to Humble himself
[1:58:20] that's great
[1:58:23] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:58:26] amen so we know by God's grace
[1:58:31] because I can't finish it just too much
[1:58:34] God's grace
[1:58:37] the Lord is is really doing something
[1:58:40] for us
[1:58:41] and we're approaching you see how the
[1:58:44] political realm moving
[1:58:47] in other words the Christians are
[1:58:48] becoming the enemy
[1:58:51] we're the ones that hold we're holding
[1:58:53] up Satan's moves
[1:59:03] and you know there's a time that that
[1:59:06] the world used to respect Christians
[1:59:10] Hallelujah I don't know what was
[1:59:13] happening in Congo and other places
