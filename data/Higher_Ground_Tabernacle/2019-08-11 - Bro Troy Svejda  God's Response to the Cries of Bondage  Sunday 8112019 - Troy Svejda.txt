ourselves amen we needed that blood hey man we could not do that ourselves no matter how hard we tried to live clean be clean be righteous can't do it could not do without him I thank the Lord glory to his name for their to our heart was the blood applied you know it's when someone does something for you if you could have done it yourself you wouldn't have any gratitude but when you come to realize that somebody did something for you that you could not do for yourself that's when the gratitude comes a man when that revelation comes to you of what Christ actually did for you then you can have gratitude amen but until you begin to I tell you catch the revelation of what Christ did for you you cannot have gratitude amen we must have that revelation a man goes without that revelation there is no true worship without that revelation there is no to prayer troop race without that revelation you will never give glory to the Lord why because you'll never have the full revelation of what Christ has done for you a member I once you come to the place where your sins have brought you down a may where your unrighteousness is before your face where you begin to see how much you have sinned and how wicked your sins were then you begin to realize oh Lord I have sinned Oh Lord I've done that which is wrong Oh Lord I need you Oh Lord forgive me O Lord wash me and then oh my then things begin to happen then things began to take place why because now you're assigning glory to him you're beginning to recognize your need for him and then that's when you can when he comes in with the blood he comes in he washes you he comes in and he's the one that makes you clean and it's something that you could not do yourself why you couldn't do it yourself then you can suck then you can assign glory to his name Amen then to your heart will the blood be applied you'll never be the same amen we need a Saints Amen if you've if you have never had that experience where you have been knocked off your high horse if you've never had that experience where you've come to realize how wicked your own sins were then you cannot assign that glory to his name how can the blood be applied to a heart that doesn't know what it's done wrong amen but let God bring the revelation and when God brings the revelation then we bring glory to his name amen let's just as we stand I want to speak a message this morning called God's response to the cries of bondage amen God's response to the cries of bondage where the people are in bondage that's when they begin to cry out but God has a specific response to the people's cries and it's not necessarily the response that you would think that it would be they miss let's let's open our Bibles to Exodus chapter 2 exodus chapter 2 we're going to read from the 23rd verse read the 23rd and 24th verse and it says there and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel side by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god and by route by reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob Amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just invite you into this place just now father Lord because we cannot have a church service without you or our need for you is complete Lord we are our need for you as entire Lord our need for you is it's all-encompassing Lord Lord we need you oh we can't do anything without you father we can't even make the first step of our lives without you as a guide for us Lord we are in total totally hopeless father without you Lord and our cry comes up before you Lord and Lord we need you so much or we cannot live our lives without your we've tried Lord we've tried to do our best Lord but we are complete failures without you so Lord therefore we cry unto you and Lauren and this morning as we cry Lord we pray father that you would bring the response father that you always bring Lord and we seal our cry to you father we pray you would seal your response unto us maybe we were maybe we respond to your response maybe we say yes and amen to it for you are true and faithful and you're the same yesterday today and forever and so is your response the same in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated now I don't want you to think that it's a strange thing that the children of Israel were in bondage God prophesied of their bondage before it ever happened now let's go back in time a little ways to the time of Abraham you remember Abraham was living in spiritual bondage he may have had physical freedom amen he may have been living at peace in his father's house in the land of ur of the Chaldees but spiritually he was in bondage he was serving the gods of his father's he was serving the gods of his land but God called him to come out of that to be free from that and to walk in the freedom of the Holy Ghost he said I will lead you to a land that I will show you and when you get to that land you will be free why was he good why was Abraham going to be free because he was not going to be living in the land where his own natan his own natural being chose he wasn't going to be living in the land that his father chose he was going to be living in the land that God himself had chose he was going to be living in the land where the Holy Ghost was leading him step by step go Abraham wherever your footsteps will lead you that will be your possession this land was to be a Holy Ghost amen and that's where he's left them but the moment that God prophesied that to Abraham this is when the smoking light went in the midst of the sacrifice that God immediately said I am giving you the land but your children will leave this land they will serve in the land of Egypt in bondage for 400 years but I will bring them out by a mighty hand they will serve until the cup of the Lamb rights for their sins and their iniquities is full until I can judge them rights they will serve the enemy they'll be in bondage to the enemy but I will bring them out by a mighty hand amen so what happened the children Oh now remember when how did how did the chong'er of it of Abraham get to Egypt they got there in peace and prosperity they went to the land of Goshen they went to the place where all of God's blessings were upon them and God showered his blessings upon to them in the land of Egypt and Goshen as Joseph the great grandson of Abraham great-great grandson as Joseph left Egypt behind he called to his father come to meet with me and they went to the throne of Pharaoh and they stood before the throne of Pharaoh that Pharaoh said look over the entire land of Egypt I give you the best of the land and they went and they went down to Goshen and it was the best part of the land of Egypt this wasn't the best part of God's land this was not the best part of God's inheritance this is not the best part of the holy ghost land but for the time being they're giving the best of the land of Egypt it was a land of Goshen of bland where they can be at peace they could be at rest all of their needs were taken care of they lived at peace but for all of that peace that they had this was not the promised land this was not the holy ghost land doesn't matter how they keep the bow and they could build their house they might my mind look how God has blessed us look how God has taken care of our needs look how we we have our vats are flowing over we have money in the bank everywhere all of our needs are taken care of my the God of Abraham has taken care of us he is Jehovah Jireh oh my he is provided for all of our needs think how good our Jehovah God is to us living here in the land of goshen but for all of that they were not living in the land that was promised to them no matter how good the blessings were they were not living in the land that Jehovah promised them temporary blessings think about that temporary blessings you know all of us have temporary blessings you know we all have things that we enjoy upon this life that make our lives here a little bit more comfortable they make our lives a little bit more ease you know when we're driving down the interstate and the car gets a little too hot for us we just reach out our hand and turn the knob a few degrees and all of a sudden we begin to get a little bit more comfortable go in and we get a little too cold then we just reach out our hand and we turn the knob back the other direction and now we begin to get a little bit more comfortable we have temporary blessings we have things that God has given us on this land the benefits of civilization the fruits of mankind's labor upon this earth to live a little bit more comfortable and we enjoy those things we use those things but for all that there is something that within me there is crying out because I know oh that is not God's promised land that is not the promise that God has given us we are going to a land where the lamb is the light amen I can walk into my house where it is dark and I'll go and all turn on the light switch so I can walk in the light but it's not supposed to be that way I'm supposed to live in a land where the lamb is the light that is my promise so that's a temporary blessing I enjoy that blessing but the Bible says if your riches increase set not your heart upon them why because that will be a snare unto you and it'll take you away from the desire for the promised land and set your desire upon the land of comfort instead you can live in Goshen living in the land of comfort but you don't have the land of promise Goshen will fail you now let's think about what happened to them in Goshen they lived there in peace and tranquility until until until God began to make their lives a little uncomfortable I think now brothers you've got all that you have need of you you're living in comfort you have a promise but the thing is is they weren't living in the promised land so then God had to make their lives a little uncomfortable he said you'll live here for 400 years and you'll live there in bondage but I'm gonna bring you out under a mighty hand amen amen so what caused the cry God did what caused the children of Israel to cry out unto the Lord God caused that cry I say no brother would what God caused the cry now I want you to think about it remember Hannah in the Old Testament she wanted a baby you know what the Bible says about her womb says God shut her wound went into the temple and cried out to the Lord but what caused the cry God caused the cry so that God could be the answer amen what about Jonah who created the fish that Jonah went into God created that fish a special fish a man was Jonah crying out in that whale you better believe John was crying out in that whale he had a lot of symptoms as brother Bram said but his cry went into the ears of the Lord you know God sometimes has to bring us to a place where we begin to cry out to him Amen it's a shame that we get that way there's just something about mankind that that we get so comfortable living outside of God's promises that God has to bring something in our lives to make us cry out unto Him amen now when when we begin to cry God's people there's something funny about God's people is when they crowd to the Lord they always cry out for a partial a partial deliverance that's just the way people are God's people when they cry out it's very rare to find anybody that's gonna cry out for a total deliverance they're always going to cry out lord save me deliver me from my task maskers so I can go back to Goshen and live in peace isn't that how it goes well I want the deliverance without the pain but God always has to bring a certain way God leads you by a certain path to make sure that you get a total deliverance amen he's not going to bring you the easy way he's going to bring you in a way because if you ever once if your cry ever comes before the throne of the Lord and it will if your cry ever gets there it will he is going to bring a response but that response is to bring a total deliverance it's always going to be for complete and total deliverance God's vision is perfection God's vision is completeness God's vision is perfection but it's not going to come the way that you think is going to come amen remember there in Romans it says that the Holy Spirit searches the hearts amen and when he searches your heart he brings a groaning that cannot be expressed to God amen so now first you were crying but now the Holy Spirit Himself is crying but let me tell you the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit begins to cry out for you he's not crying out for you according to your desires he's not crying out according to your wishes he's not crying out for the things that you want the Bible says he cries out for you according to the will of God my so so what was the end result of your cry now you've got the Holy Spirit's attention now you have the Holy Spirit's full attention upon you why because you are groaning you are crying out you are suffering and you said O Lord save me O Lord deliver me O Lord heal me O Lord take me away these things out of my life Lord I'm sinning Lord I'm failing Lord I'm doing this wrong Lord I'm doing that wrong lord I need deliverance Lord I need this loretty that and your cry inches up to the Lord of Heaven and now a sudden the whole you got the Holy Spirit's attention the eyes of heaven are upon you and he sees you crying out there why does he do now the Holy Spirit joins in with you and he begins groaning he begins crying but he hasn't grown out Lord send him back to Goshen and peace Lord sent him back speaking of there he says Lord shake that man down shake him out of his own self will shake him out of his own ideas shake him how his own desires bring him down to his knees so he can be a total deliverance bring him act into compliance with the will of God how does a man get into compliance with the will of God how does that happen because God's will will not mix with your will it doesn't it will not work that way so if you ever find yourself in a position where you're crying out to God for something let me assure you that God's first step is going to find as to search your life and find out if you're in compliance with the will of God my what would think about that what would happen in your life right now if the Holy Spirit were to search your heart and look to see if you're in compliance with the will of God Arab become a great shaking there come a great what why is why a shaking because if you're not in compliance with the will of God he's got to shake you down to nothing before he can build you back up so the end result of your crying is that your situation gets worse lower I cried out for healing I'll cry out for deliverance yes but God is determined to bring you to his will to bring you to his desire oh I wanted to be healed oh I wanted to be delivered but now I seem like I'm getting worse I seem like it's faintly I seems like it's not working no God is just trying to get you to die he's trying to get you to the place where you can finally be like job and die out and have the nothing but lord save me think about it how I ain't here would love to have a job experience who here would love to have a job experience your bank account it's gone your children your family it's gone everything's you have your wife is turned against you it's gone but God is trying to conform you to his will my powerful say brother that's that's not a very fury sermon but this is how God at this is how he operates God has a vision of you that has been of old before the foundations of the world amen and that vision he doesn't want anything to get in the way of that vision amen and when you begin to cry out to God he first goes back to what the vision was amen and then he looks why because that vision is his will for you God has a will for your life amen but if you are not living in compliance to the vision in compliance to the will then guys got to shake you down for a while to bring you back to a total deliverance amen remember if God ever wants his gonna deliver you he's not here for a half-hearted deliverance amen God doesn't do that God is not interested in half Christians hey I wanted to read a quote brother Branham when he was a preaching there in a total deliverance he says just like you he says if you are a Christian God don't make any halfway Christians my God doesn't make halfway Christians we can try to be halfway but that's not God's idea and when you try to be halfway about it let me tell you there is going to be a sharp correction coming down the road why because God has a vision for your life and it's not your vision it's his Amen God makes complete Christians he said God don't make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're halfway Christians it's not God's intention for them to be that way it's just their own ways got mixed up with the of God for their life my a blending took place they took their ways they mixed it with God's ways and they tried to march forward amen and that's what makes them the way they are God doesn't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side he wants them to stand completely in the breech he wants them to stand completely saw right they're rock solid Christians amen living in the promises of God amen but let me tell you if you're ever once going to be in the promised land God if you're if God is ever going to take you to the promised land where all this promises are made manifest God's first guy get you out of the way that's just the way it is Saints say oh I would love to live in the power of God and see his manifestations I'd love to see how he heels how he delivers how he sets free amen let me tell you you got to die and rot before you ever get to that place hey man you got to die and rot before you ever get there amen it's just the same way God does not make halfway Christians he just will not do it amen he just will not do it amen no God has a habit of listening to the cries of his people amen you know he judged Sodom and Gomorrah because the cries of the land came up to him amen they were oppressing the people in life the people were suffering amen but what'd he do he brought the deliverance but no one really wanted to be delivered Amen think about it he judged no no he came down he sent the angels to Sodom and Gomorrah because of the cries of the people the cries ended up before the Lord but who wanted to be delivered no one really wanted to be delivered they had to drag them out kicking and screaming the few that came lot and his daughters but no one really wanted to be delivered now they cried because of the witness of the city they cry because the oppression of wickedness they cry because their house got broken into they cry because their family was ravished they cry because of this they cry because of that but when the deliverer came they would not follow the deliverance out and they ended up dying in the fire God sent the judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah because the cries of sodom and gomorrah entered into his ears a man but who got delivered very few let me tell you not everybody that cried in sodom and gomorrah got deliverance from songs more actually their cry instead brought judgment down upon themselves that's powerful think about that your own cry can bring judgment upon you and there is no no consolation that you will actually be delivered why because it only comes by a total submission Amy there's a lot of people crying to God all over the world but when God does come to deliver them if they do not come out and then what's next judgement we can we can cry out about faith and the power of God in our lives all day long seven ways to Sunday aim it we can cry out all day long for the deliverance of God amen but when the deliverer comes he is coming to take you out of living in your in your hot off your high horse he's coming to take you out of living according to your will he's coming to deliver you from yourself from your own fleshly waste he's coming to deliver you from the nature of the beast amen that's what he's coming to do and when that deliverer arrives at your doorstep when the cry of the deliverer enters into your ears when you're sitting there and all sudden you hear the cry of the deliverer come out of her my people because you've been crying unto them for healing you've been to him for salvation you've been crying into him because you're beginning to get a little uncomfortable why because Goshen has now become bondage amen that which was peace unto you in Egypt now is becoming bondage in your life and you're beginning to get a little uncomfortable you're beginning to get a little oh I don't like this oh I don't like that Lord I wish you would save me Lord I wish you to deliver me but once the deliverer comes and starts preaching in your ear let me tell you you better listen to what he has to say amen because those that were in Sodom and Gomorrah did the same thing they cried out for the oppression of the wickedness but when the deliverers came they would not listen they would not hearken they would not they would not get their deliverance instead they were those that cried to God receive God's judgment that's powerful as a dangerous thing I think go to the Christian bookstore look up and down the shelves they all will tell you how to believe for God's deliverance how to receive God's deliverance but the messenger comes he's coming to bring you to his perfect will he's coming to get you to live in accordance with the vision what was the vision for this day it's a message a message window a message a last day message went out to the people why did the last day message come out because those that are living in comfort we're getting ready to go into bondage those that are living in a city that has no walls remember Jerusalem they're living in a city they had no walls they were living in a place of comfort they were living in a place of comfort and God says armories gonna come upon them suddenly in America we are living in a land that has no walls living in a peace crying out but we're living in comfort outside of the will of God so God sends a message God always sends a message time amen so when the message came that people have a choice they can live in obedience to the will of God to the vision of the day to the message of the hour or they can ignore it and keep crying out to God for deliverance to go back in peace but living in Goshen they want to go back and live in peace and Egypt God's trying to bring them to the land of the promise but they want to stay in Egypt amen they want just enough deliverance to make them comfortable again but not enough deliverance to go to the land of all the promises bye Hannah was crying out gosh shut her wound I tell the cry got they went up year by year every year they go up to Shiloh they'd worship the Lord they go home and the next year that she'd cry a little bit stronger and then they'd go home the next year they'd cry a little bit stronger but God got her to the place where she had gotten down on her knees she was crying out to the Lord Lord I need a child Lord I need a look this is the burden of my heart I'm crying out Lord and Eli the priest look learners this is a drunk woman what happened she got to the place where she was crying out to God the cry got she had finally given up on everything in her life and said Lord if you'd if you don't give me a child I'll perish why the child was the promised God and when the cry got to a certain place to a certain condition to where he knew she had died out to herself then God brought the promise and brought her to the promised land amen so many people do not like the Pentecostal way of crying out for the Holy Ghost it offends them the the Baptist's are offended at the Pentecostal message why are they offended when the Pentecostal message came in 1906 why were the Baptist's offended that message because they said we do not have to cry out for the Holy Ghost we automatically get it without crane oh we don't have to cry to the Lord we get to live here in comfort and so they were offended at the message and so they've gone on in that offense and in that offense crying out against the Pentecostal walk why because they didn't want to cry out for the promise God has to bring his people to a place where they will cry out it's God's Way it's God's way God has to shake us off of our high horse when we live in things that we know that are wrong and yet we continue to do them anyway then God has a great shaking ahead in store for you a man and there's no guarantee that you're going to to be saved or not be saying unless your name you'll it written upon the Lamb's Book of Life amen but you have to find that out for yourself amen amen many people are happy to live in bondage they want just enough comfort just enough comfort they do they're satisfied with not living in the Promised Land they really don't want to go to the promised land they would rather just live in bondage because it's a little bit easier they don't have to die out it's easier for their flesh it's harder for their spirit they try to find that balance that's not God's way God's response to the cries of the people is always I will bring you a total deliverance but it will be according to my will amen and my will is my word amen you will come in compliance to my word to my message why every time your cry comes the holy spirits are crying but he checks your life by the word and by the promise guaranteed if you've ever once cry out to Lord for something he did come and he searched your heart amen and he's and he's groaning out for you to bring you back in compliance to the word and to the promise how does he do it he has many ways that he can do it and they're not always easy amen but they all involve dying out they all involve dying out to yourself amen if you refuse that message when he comes and speaks in your ears he can leave you behind for years years there's no guarantee that he'll come back amen when people reject that when the message comes amen he comes because you cried amen but when the messenger comes and you reject that message there is no guarantee you ever get a second chance you could just live laissez-faire until the Judgment Day comes that's a scary thing amen amen amen God's expectation for your life is always a willingness for a full deliverance every time that's God's expectation God's expectation for your life every single time you cry is that you will have a willingness for a full deliverance through dying out to yourself that's the message my you die out to yourself you have to do it there's just no other way Amen let's turn her to job chapter 36 I'm just going really slow this morning I just want this to seek in deeply we've all cried to the Lord but we've all cried half-heartedly the Lord before too and it's not our position to cry half-heartedly to the Lord if we ever once cry to Lord we have to expect that God will bring a full and complete deliverance and they'll be according to his will which will not match up necessarily with your will amen Joe chapter 36 verse 5 we're going to read the next eleven verses here just going to go through them one by one verse job 36 five it says behold God is mighty when you cry you must first come to the place that you understand that God is mighty because you if you ever once cry before Lord you're never gonna get anything if you don't first know that he's Almighty a man you have to know that he's Almighty he is completely able to fulfill your deliverance he is completely able to give you the total deliverance that you are looking for he is able right now to bring you back to being a 22 year old perfect body he is right now able to bring you to being back in the image of a st. Paul or a Mary the mother of Jesus he's able to do that he is able to bring you to a place to where you were completely died out and a prisoner to the Lord Jesus Christ if only you will he's able he's mighty he can do it that which he starts in your life he will always be able to finish amen if you will amen behold God is mighty and despise us not any nobody no one he will not despise you he is mighty in strength and wisdom but verse 6 he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the poor he was draweth not his eyes from the righteous but with Kings are they on the throne the righteous will reign with the kings amen yeah he does establish them forever and they're exalted but look at verse 8 and if they let's talking about the righteous if they be bound in fetters and holding in cords of afflictions you know the righteous could ever get like that yeah they can get like that that could happen to the righteous amen if they ever be bound in fetters and hold and cords of affliction verse 9 then he show us them their works he show us them their transgressions that they have exceeded and he openeth also their ears to discipline and he commandeth that they return from iniquity well that's a blessing that is a blessing that the righteous he'll open up their ears to that he's given them a chance to repent God always gives the righteous an opportunity to repent from your sentence from your iniquities from doing the things that are wrong anytime you've exceeded the Word of God gone past what the word told you to do he's going to give you a message to come back to repentance that's his mercy towards the righteous he says he openeth also their ears to discipline what a blessing thank God he does that thank God you know he's doing that for you right now he's doing that for you right now from this very pulpit through this mouth he gave me he's opening your ears to return back from the things where you've gone beyond the Word of God he said Lord I was righteous but I thought well I'm going to go do this over here no he gives you a chance to come back and repent come back to compliance to the will of God how do how do I do that you have to humble yourself and get down on your knee he's circumcised the flesh to come back to righteousness there's got to be a return to righteousness we're going back to the ways of the Lord we're cutting off the excess flesh we're circumcised in ourselves to go back to Christ Lord forgive me or heal me Lord I'm sorry I did that which was wrong Lord your words said this but I did this Lord I had the wrong attitude forgive me Lord he opened in your ears to go back to righteousness amen now verse 11 if they obey and serve Him they shall spin their days and prosperities and their years and pleasures what is that that's not going oh no no don't don't don't are you thinking though if your mind went to Goshen right there that's not the case he's taking you to the promised land hey man he's going to wear all the promises he's not gonna restore Goshen to you he's gonna restore the land of the promise to you amen that's the prosperity that you will get a man you live at peace and the Holy Ghost wherever the Holy Ghost lives and moves the Holy Ghost is like the wind nobody knows where he's coming from nobody knows where he's going and so is everybody that's led by the Holy Ghost they are know where he's coming from they don't know where they're going they might work here for a while and go over there they may they may they may they may a commute communion with this group people for a while and then withdraw themselves and go over here amen they may they may be witness to this person for a while they may go witness this person for a while amen they had no one knows where the Holy Ghost sled man is gonna go why because he's being led by the Holy Ghost like the wind he comes and he goes he's no one knows how he's going no one can judge him because he's being led by the Holy Ghost amen sometimes he might go through a hard time but that's okay he's being led by the Holy Ghost God might pair his life down nothing but he'll rejoice I'm being led by the holy ghost that's what God does that's who he is that's how he acts amen if they obey and serve Him they shall spend their days and prosperity in their years and pleasures verse 12 but if they obey not they perish by the sword they shall die without knowledge Amen they won't even know it'll die they won't even understand they won't even realize why they're going through the things that they're going through with not that knowledge will be held away from them why because of their disobedience that's the deceitfulness of disobedience that you could actually die in your sins without ever realizing why the holy ghost never led you that's powerful if you ever get to the promised land let me know assuredly you'll get there by the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen but the man that refuses the leadership of the Holy Ghost he will die without knowledge won't even know why he never made it to the promised land until he gets up to the white throne judgment and he also realizes because you rejected my message when I came to deliver you I came to pull you out I came I said oh come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins but you would not my they died without knowledge amen verse 13 but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath now what are the hypocrites in heart they are they that these are those that say they are Christians but all the time every time they have a chance to go back to the word they go back and they do something else instead they say that they are one thing but they're going and they're doing something different they say they're in compliance with the Word of God when they call themselves Christians but in their mind they never actually choose by their own will to bring themselves in subjection to the word my God calls them hypocrites amen let's read that again verse verse 12 but or verse 13 but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath and they cry not when he binded them who binds him God knows God allows or he'd rather he allows Satan to bind them but no matter what God is the one that allows it amen and what happens they don't even know it they are bound they cannot be free they will stay in Sodom and Gomorrah why because they will not receive the freedom when it comes therefore they're bound in iniquities and how can they ever be set free how can they and look their cry they still cry these are a people that they will still cry because of their bondage amen but what does it say about their cry they cry not when he binds them now they will cry later in their bondage but they don't even cry what he's they don't mind that God is binding them in their bondage now later when it affects their well-being they'll cry but think about right here they don't why don't they cry when he's binding them because they love their sins they love their iniquities they love the things that they're doing wrong so much that they don't even mind that the binds are getting stronger their arms are getting pulled tighter and they don't cry out for the sins because they enjoy them too much and so they do not cry when they're being bound they'll cry later after they're after the binding is finished they will cry God won't hear their cry unless say unless God grants them mercy God won't hear their cry my that's strong words that's a strong word that's a strong message they will not cry when they're being bound because they enjoy their sins too much verse 14 they die in youth and their life is among the unclean they die while they're young they never come to perfection they never come to completion they never come to the vision that God had for them and they lived their life amongst those that are unclean they can't come amongst the believers why they're bound in their sins their sins pulled them away from the believers and that's where they live all their days going on to judgment and they don't even won't even know won't even won't even have their ears open to know that they are bound amen that's a solemn message the deceitfulness of our sins the deceitfulness of iniquity Satan is coming as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour amen and he always lays a little sin across your path something small for you step into you to see if you will leave the word to behind and walk into that comfort that he's laid before and when he sees you take the first step he knows uh-huh I can lead this man amen and as he and he just goes he'll lay one that's just a little bit further out of the way and a little bit further out of the way you don't even know you're being slow walked away you don't even know that you're being bound don't even know that you're being bound until all sudden you wake up in your eyes I'm not even free I don't have the freedom of a Holy Ghost someday you'll see a man there's walking in the freedom of the Holy Ghost and you realize that there's a vast difference between you and him you look at a man that's filled with the Holy Ghost being led by the Holy Ghost you like why can't I be like that brother because you're bound your sins your iniquities have bound you and you cannot be free why can't I be like so-and-so why can't have the faith to cry out to God why can't I have the deliverance for my oh I'm sick I can't be healed I need deliverance I can't get rid of this I can't grow that why because you're bound you didn't cry out for the sins now you're gonna be forced to cry out for the consequences why if God ever once convicts you for your sins remember the righteous we set out he'll open up their ears and give them a chance to repent amen that's the time to repent otherwise you play the heart of the part of the hypocrite amen and you how can you get to the land of promise how can you ever get there remember God's expectation is always that you will have a willingness for a total and complete deliverance that is God's expectation for your life if you do not have that willingness for a complete deliverance then God does not can't lead you to the promised land you want to go back to Goshen and live in peace but God is true bring on the bondage and sell you cry out to get out of that thing so that you can accept the message for your day amen a man we all know what the promises are but they don't come to people that are in bondage amen you know don't don't don't don't seek just the promises don't do it don't don't just cry out for the promises of God cry out for the deliverance from your sins cry out to be set free you got to get in order to get to the promised land God has to completely set you free otherwise you won't get there people say oh I God did this miracle and they'll rejoice and all the miracles and signs and wonders but don't you realize the children of Israel that died in the wilderness did the same thing and he could rejoice and all those signs and wonders so much but we got to we got to look for a total deliverance without that total deliverance we're lost since we're lost we can't get there we can't get where we were supposed to go without that total deliverance but God has a total deliverance for you amen amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 now Hebrews chapter 11 we call it the faith chapter has a description of a mini believers throughout history that received the message for their day and believed it and walked out now many people will take this chapter and they look at these these believers and they just say oh by faith they just had faith for the benefits but when you go back and read the lives of these people they didn't just have faith for the benefits they had faith for the total deliverance they had been shaken down to nothing and they believed in God alone that's the faith that they had there was not a half-hearted deliverance for them amen thinking that by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain but Abel had to get to some sufferings in order to do that amen by faith Enoch was translated they should see not death but in order for Enoch to get to that translation he had to walk with God isn't that right amen verse 6 it says but without faith is impossible to plead him to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and that's what all these had in common is they are diligently seeking the Lord they became the righteous they were set up on the Thrones with the Kings a man and they reign here in Hebrews chapter 11 amen and it also says that they're not perfect without us we have to make the same choice amen we have to have the same total deliverance we have to accept the message for our day and walk out of it amen and walk into the promised land that God has laid in store for us God is waiting for you to cry unto Him amen and when you cry he we'll begin to cry for you to bring you into obedience to his will amen and you have to be ready for that I want you to think about that every time you are suffering in your body in your spirit in your mind amen and you get down on your knees because you're suffering that you remember you are setting in motion a chain of events it's guaranteed it's got to happen it's going to happen your cry will go up into the ears of the Lord and enter into his temple it'll enter into his temple where the blood of the Lamb is laying upon the altar and as your cry enters into his ears the Holy Spirit will come down and he will search your heart a halo look at your heart and then when the Holy Spirit has searched your heart and he's looked around and all the doors of your heart and he's looked at all things in there then he begins to cry out with utterance and groanings that cannot even be understood and as that Holy Spirit begins to cry out oh my Jehovah God he has this wrong in his life he's doing this over here he's not in obedience to the message over here he's not doing this he is diseased he's being loose he's being slothful he's groaning Oh Lord Oh Lord bring him back to compliance bring him back to the Word of God bring him back to restore him to righteousness and he's bringing you he's crying out unto you according to the will of God to bring your heart into back to the will of God and now when the Holy Spirit begins to cry out for you they're all son it sets into motion a chain of events that will do one of two things that chain of events will either bring you into submission to a willingness for a total deliverance or will bring you to a hardness of heart so you can go out to the judgment that's powerful what caused it you did you cried out to the Lord and that's what happened say brother where is that in the scriptures that's her to Romans chapter 8 romans chapter 8 verse 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that which cannot be uttered no one can pray like the spirit prays for you amen but he will do it amen thank God he does do it amen well verse 27 and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he makes intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so our infirmities causes us to pray but we don't necessarily know how to pray what do you mean we don't know how to pray because we'll pray against the will of God we'll do it we will pray against a little gun but if we say Lord let thy will be done and guaranteed the Holy Spirit's coming he's coming to search your heart amen and to groan for you to make intercession for you according to the will of God but if you're not walking in the will of God then he will bring forth a complete and total deliverance for you but if you don't want to be delivered then you'll be driven further away from God that's I'm telling you this is what happens when you pray when you cry out to the Lord this is what happens we don't always realize that this is what's happening but this is what happens and God many people they'll cry out to God but they're never willing for a complete and total deliverance and they're not willing to come into compliance with the will of God or the Word of God so then they cry out and their cry actually drives them further away from the Lord let's read a ornery 1/4 brother branham's here another quote from a total deliverance he says and that's when the church shall be completely delivered when everything comes under the blood when your sins kind of come under the blood when you're smoking when you're gambling when you're cheating when you're stealing when you're lying when everything is brought under the blood then there will be a total deliverance you've wronged somebody make it right you can't bring that under the blood it won't stay you can't bring it something won't let you do it but when your self is completely totally brought under the blood there will be a total deliverance and then you'll have a freedom like you've never known before when everything is brought under the blood brought in submissive to the kingdom of God then there will be a real deliverance that's when it happens there we go amen total complete deliverance amen it can happen if you want it to if you will whosoever will let him come into me there's no what jesus said whosoever will let him come to me it sounds so simple but many just plain don't have the will they just don't have the will to submit themselves under God they can't come to the altar and cry out to him they don't have time for that they don't have time to cry out for God they don't have the they don't have time for it they don't they don't want to they just don't have the desire for it they they just and they'll never see it they won't see it because it's lost not for them if they because it's only for those who will whosoever will let them come if you have the will then you can come if you don't have the will you can't come you gotta have the fortitude of mind saying I am going all the way if I'm gonna take one step I'm gonna take all the steps amen because I'm going all the way I would need you to total deliverance I gotta have it I must have it whatever it takes I want a total deliverance got your cry to the Lord amen will bring God's response but God's response is always to bring you to a total deliverance Amen it's the only way it's the only thing that can happen it's the only way the guard can ever do it amen is to bring you to a total deliverance amen amen we know what the promises are but they don't come to people living in bondage they just won't do it they just can't do it when you're living in bondage you just cannot experience the promises the Lord you can't go to the promised land you can't not have it you have to have a total complete deliverance and you have to trust and who your deliverer is amen God will send you a deliverer amen but you have to submit to him everyone they cross that left Egypt in the Red Sea were baptized unto Moses amen and when they would not listen to Moses they were judged according to their baptism amen and so is the same with us every single one of us that was baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ left our sickness life of sin behind amen and we'll be judged according to that baptism if we will not submit ourselves unto the Lord Jesus Christ your baptism will become judgment to you Amen why because you walked out through the Red Sea saying I will follow Moses everywhere he goes I will be obedient while he says you walked out through the water to the Lord Jesus Christ in Baptism he said I'll follow him everywhere he goes but then when his word comes oh I'll do this instead you will end up in the world dying in the wilderness judged because you would did were no disobedience to your own baptism my Amen when the cry comes he checks your life by the word and by the promise a man remember naman in the New Testament God told him dip in the door or dip in the river Jordan seven times a man the man was a Syrian and he says aren't the rivers in Syria better than the rivers in Jordan Amen why do I have to go to why do I have to go and dip in that one I don't want to dip there I am a king I am dressed to my royal clothes I have to disrobe myself in the presence of my the enemy's land amen I have to disrobe myself amongst the Israelis amidst amongst the Jews amen I don't want to put myself a humble myself before then why should I do it by his services but if he had asked you to do some great thing and give a million dollars or do this whenever you've done it but he asked you to just humble yourself in the sight of God's people and your leprosy will leave you amen and so isn't the same thing God asks us to humble ourselves in the midst of God's people to to cry out for the sins that we've done in our flesh and to that we might receive forgiveness for our sins amen but you got to humble yourself you got to make things right amen why because if you cry out to the Lord he has an expectation they're gonna go willingly to a total complete deliverance Amen God knows how to get you out of the bondage that you're in if you're willing amen and that's what it all comes down to whosoever will let him come unto me amen amen let's just stand say brother you're gonna end the message right there and the message right there the Holy Spirit is able to convict every single one of us amen and the Holy Spirit has a desire to bring every single one of us to a total deliverance but we have to be willing to do it we have to actually set in mind oh if God asks us to do some great thing wouldn't we have done it if God asks us to publicly give a hundred dollars to someone who needed it for deliverance wouldn't we have done it amen if God had asked us to do - to give groceries to the poor - or to do some marvelous thing that we could have the praise a man for it wouldn't we do it but God asks us to humble ourselves to lay down in his altar to seek for a total deliverance amen but it only comes if we desire to go all the way a may say oh brother I have this this pain in my body I'm crying out to the Lord to heal me well I I can't seem to get rid of this bondage I I keep stumbling in this area I do this over and over again I can't seem to get the victory over it Amen God has a plan to bring you out of that God has a plan and he has the ability to back up that plan but it only comes through you humbling yourselves to a total deliverance because God has doesn't make halfway Christians God doesn't do it he doesn't make halfway Christians he makes Christians they follow him to the promised land amen and they go through the heart through thick and thin I say I will follow them and never goes the Bible is full of people Amen from the children of Israel through the wilderness from Hannah trying to have the baby amen Jonah down into the whale people everywhere that God put them in a position where they could finally come down into submission to the will of God and all of us have things that we've cry out to God for amen but God has a greater desire for you that you would come into obedience to the will of God that's God's desire for your life amen then you'll live in prosperity then you'll live in peace then you'll live in the plan to the promise where all the little promises come to pass amen but to expect that without going through through through the hard time amen it just isn't going to happen Saints God has to bring you into obedience to his will you have to become circumcised to the world and the things of the world to live in the promised land it's got to be that way amen so look we're just gonna pray here right here right now amen I want to say the altar is open if you have things you need to make right before the Lord the author is open amen if you need to write make things right with someone else you need to go to them amen and you need to make sure that you do it well I'll do that tomorrow well you need you better make sure you do because God brought the message God has a plan for you to bring you to his Promised Land amen and if you refuse to go to the promised land then you be bound in hardness of heart and you will not even know where you meet I'd say brother that's wrong wait we can't live halfway we just can't do it we can try to live that peaceful halfway Christian life and go back to the land of goshen where it's all his peace and rest God will not let us do it it's the evening time it's time to go home it's time to get out of here and he doesn't make halfway he's not gonna marry a halfway bright he's marrying a bride without spot without wrinkle that has washed her garments in the blood of the Lamb amen but that only comes through the crying out and for God to search your heart and to bring you to a total deliverance amen let's just pray Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for the message this morning or a solemn message a checking up message Lord Lord maybe it may be not the easiest message to listen to the lordís truth Lord Lord I just I I cry out for my own self father Lord if I'm doing anything wrong Lord if I have any wickedness in my own way lord I want that totaled I don't want a halfway deliverance father I want a total

picture Lord and we say yes and amen to it we submit ourselves just now to your will and Laura we say Lord have they known way in us Lord I pray father the people if they gather to the altar if they cry out to you Lord that when you cry hear their cry Lord when you search their hearts when you I pray Lord that you would also Lord open their ears and have mercy on us and show us the way out of the bondage that we're in Lord that we might rejoice in peace of God Lord or that we could be the true church without spot or wrinkle Lord living the way according to the will of the Holy Ghost Laura we need it father we have to have it Lord we just can't live without it Lord for the day is late Lord we need it Lord and we cry out to you for it so lord I pray far if the people are if they have the module or that you'd hear them and answer their plea father and cry out for them with groanings that cannot be heard and we thank you for it Lord in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we give the rest of the service into your hands have thine own way in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen I just want to say brother his brother comes up to us to the met for the song service I don't have to pump you up

Jesus is he going to prayer I want to read this one quote he said we are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost we don't have to have the devil dictate to us we don't have to dictate to us Christ delivered us total deliverance deliver us from evil delivered us from sin deliver us from habits deliver us from talking he deliver us from blackness from Black Guard he deliver us from all kinds of smutty things he delivered us and put us into his holy hands a complete and total deliverance he delivered our sickness he delivered us from sickness for we have an abstract deed to that hallelujah for he was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed amen he delivered us and put us into his holy hands a complete and total deliverance so as I leave you this morning I am Telling You and there's a hard message but I'm putting you into his holy hands amen so as we go into prayer let's not go in doubt let's not go in half way thinking that's not going halfway or anything let's go into a complete and total desire that he that began the good work in us is able to complete it and fulfill it all the way to the end amen because he has given and delivered us into his own holy hands by a total and complete deliverance amen so we're gonna go into prayer right now my wife will play some piano music there and we're gonna pray and as the Lord gives you release you may go hey man but Laura's dealing with you then I would urge you to stay and pray amen and seek out a total deliverance but it only comes by submitting your life to the Lord and saying Lord I'm yours I give myself my complete self to you show me Lord how to walk let me walk in your ways o Lord show me your paths guide me in truth and righteousness Lord for your name's sake that is the way a male walky in it Amen god bless you Saints let's go under prayer amen [Music]
