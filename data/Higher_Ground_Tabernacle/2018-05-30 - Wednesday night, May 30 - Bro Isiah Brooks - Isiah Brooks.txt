or maybe all our concerns all our questions all our maybe our Oh load amen all life just give it to him amen amen the more that I surrender whoa that I surrendered the ladder Milo a man the more that I surrender the light of the load a man you love the Lord believers from Canada sent us another one of their Flyers I meant their book which I won't show that it's really good it's got some powerful testimonies in it think you'll like it so I put them out on the table there for anyone who would like one also I want to get out by God's grace you can probably put it on the email those who wants to participate in the choir who had planned to go down to Iowa City to do in the meetings we're gonna have a rehearsal Saturday down in Iowa City at 3 o'clock we can always carpool and I can meet here at 12:30 1:00 o'clock for those who might want to go and participate so I rehearse it again for you amen so God is good to us amen they've had one who rehearsal already and so that's where all the musicians are we trying to get them to come up here hey man they do come every now and get on Sun every other Sunday night Amen it's wonderful when they do show by God's grace so we appreciate the Lord Jesus amen we thank you it was so amazing I had two experiences today one good and one bad how about that of course y'all don't know what I'm talking about none of y'all ever have bad experiences Amen but you know I like to tell it because you know sometimes Satan think he's get the best of you when he causes you to falter I'm thinking I'd say the good one to the last but today I had to take my card took my copy prior to coming here I took my car to the wash and I got in a little heated argument which I have haven't been angry like that in a long time if you know anything about my card has that little button that you push to start the car you put your foot on the brake and you start it with the button of course they've been about six times they've done that and they push my button all the way down in there so once it start I can't stop it you know I can't cut it off and I can't cut it back home so anyway I've had patients with them because the first time they did it they they said it was my I did it it was like your car has a problem and I know they broke it but but as long as he repaired it they put it back to a place where I could use it I just left it but every time they would do it I even instructed them and the times I instructed them they didn't do it they did it right when I figured they knew what they were doing that's when they messed it up about six times so today I got really upset because the guy blamed it on the button I said but if it's broken y'all did it I'm not asking you for no money I've been patience with you anyway one thought went to another but at the end of it all my voice was elevated so much so I really felt ashamed of myself that I I just did not show that witness for Christ you see that's what the devil does he allowed things like that to happen to make it difficult for you to witness to that person and that person could be seed so it won't be the first I apologize he apologized so I know this guy didn't have to apologize but he did and we got it all straight we did everything but hug each other but I still felt bad because I knew better when I let the enemy get to this to me secondly I was down at at grace lake this is the good part and I was walking and this man was behind me he says look at that eagle and I thought he was talking about in the nest here was a eagle following me just a little bit above I jumped I could have scared he really scared me here he comes like this like this walking I'm looking at him and then all of a sudden he went forward and looked me in my face like that and then he turned back and flew off I said whoo my god I don't know what that was all about but we're just talking about how I love Eagles well he must have felt the vibe I don't know how but I said Lord if that's you telling me you want to see me face to face that's okay cuz it was it was a little nervous movement being that close to an eagle and I'm thinking when the man said to ego anyway when I he went back up into the nest and he's kept staring at me it were facing me like I'm like I'm not going to look because I don't want you to attack me I don't know what you do I don't know but it was a blessing it was a blessing at after I settled down it's so strange I've gone there many times they used to be tuning this I'll call when I'm grooving there an eagle Ruby and Isaiah and I brought a minister there with me one time I said all right now y'all show off for me and they got a part of an S and came for I know y'all think I'm crazy I know the truth I said I said I told I told the past I say you know they always hear my voice but I was just kidding y'all just kidding with him but it was amazing when I asked him to show they show one time I was down there I saw the Eagle come and hit that water caught that fish right in front of me and just took it back up to the nest I don't know it was a wonderful thing you love the Lord and I get carried away maybe I'll go to the extreme of things but I try to balance it out I try to think everything is done for a purpose everything everything has a meaning nothing nothing happens by chance hallelujah I told you about that one time as a little boy I learned that because I bought my head I was walking I mean scuse me I stomped my toe and when I was I was walking under that tree house dumped my toe and I had to bend down and I not dump my toe I want to hit the branch which one would you prefer just missed it so I thank God for every action you know everything has a purpose as I see well thank you Lord for that in Jesus name okay we thank God for His grace and His mercy amen and we still thank God for Jared imma Kailyn amen coming and you know I I thought to myself I said lord I want to see how they doing today I don't want to pressure him or anything you know I want them to feel free to come and go as they choose however the Lord lead them it I really thank God for them showing up or coming tonight he even drove down and the other brother the other brother he must have gotten caught up I know he said he was going to be here brother Mike from Main Street but you know God is real God is real Amen let's get right to the scripture here trying to think where I really want to start by God's grace because I'm kind of working with the same thought the life of a warrior and account the cause you know we all have to counter cause we have to realize and see what it's going to be when we we have it so easy in our day and you know it's the truth because we realize by God's grace easy living is our worst enemy right it is the thing that kills the Christian you know it's when a person go through trials and tribulation is when you really see what's on the inside and so you know the Christians of all understood where they stood they were willing to sacrifice their life even unto death and so like I said we find out that that's what happened in Israel when God began to bless Israel with so many great things the Bible said when Jack when jess wan wet wax fat that was another name for Israel she begins to kick and God said listen when I found you you would still hook to your mother's neighbor cord you were still laying in your blood I cleaned you up and yet once I've made you what you are you kicked against me and that's what happened to Israel god bless them so greatly until they really miss their Messiah but we know by God's grace it's just in a little while mmm you can almost taste that honey right the coming of the Lord is sooner than what most people think the Bible said it'll be at a time when you think not Amen let's let's go to the scripture here let's go to Ephesians 6:10 2:14 Ephesians 6:10 2:14 the life of a warrior is a it's a difficult and and it's full of trials it's full of tests but most of all it's also full of victories a real warrior is one who had been in battle and have a few battle scars anybody know what I'm talking about amen you're gonna have a yeah brother be to a lot of battle scars but nevertheless you know it makes you when when we get over again to tell our story you could say see this one that's when that happened it see this so you'll be able to of course it won't be any scars there I'm just saying you know you have a testimony by God's grace finally my brother were getting at the tenth verse be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places well 4 take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for Malachi 4 5 & 6 Lord oh god were the spirit of Elijah Lord and how you've done so many great things for us through this word when we pray father god hallelujah that by the preaching of this word we will be transformed into your very image and likeness and father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in your Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray you may be seated you know we fight this battle but had it not been for Jesus Christ where would we be for here's the true and mighty Conqueror he is the only one that was able to defeat Satan even though we've had great leaders like Moses Elijah right Joshua you know they were great warriors but there was one who was perfect and each one of these prophets also exemplified a portion of God like I said this whole thing is like a puzzle and your piece of that puzzle the puzzle in itself cannot be complete without you right so you and I understand that god when he created all things he created us and we were in him in other words so you cannot have eternal life and less eternal life was with you before the foundation of the world eternal life has no beginning and has no ending so how are we who are in time receive eternal life the thing that gives us eternal life is the eternal God because once eternal life is in this body in this house in this vessel this vessel becomes eternal you understand me and when we say these things are better we could better understand that those who are with God in the mind of God amen in other words let me say like this a woman cannot ever tell she'll never know how many children she can produce neither can a man right but we know by God's grace if that man and that woman got married they will have so many children and then stop at some point it stops right it is then they know how many children were in them that was needed to be manifested hallelujah but God is not like that God knows all of us he knew all he knows all of our names hallelujah he said Jeremiah I knew you before you was formed in your mother's womb is that right think about it God a man who who knows who we are as the Bible says he knew us before we were fashioned right before we even started in our mother's womb God knew us and and so if God knew us that means we must have been with him right before the foundation to learn see God is not like you and I will forget the only thing that God forgets is your sins once they're confessed hallelujah so we realized by God's grace amen that when God he knows the outcome like the Bible says he'd know our beginning from the end and all in from the beginning he saw his commie Souls lead and no matter how many times you know I don't care what kind of machines they produce by way of science when God get ready for you to die you can have a thousand people hold your hand and say please don't leave me and you're going to go right because life in itself is given by God and life in itself is taken by God right everything moving moving moving by what the power of God now we look at this and you say well what do you mean see God this is a whole drama and the Bible said God created all these things for his pleasure now we don't fully understand everything but think about it in our worship God is amused yes he is he's entertained yes he is hallelujah and he didn't have to do it God did this a man he had angels way before we were there in a manifestation form right they worship Him in other words he was Elohim and Elohim means self existing one he could not become God until there was something there to worship him so he created cherubims he created Sarah films he created the living creatures and all of that and all of these beings were worshiping him right the Bible says according to Isaiah the seraphim's cry out holy holy holy holy all day long oh you know they're feeling good amen they're in the presence of the Lord hallelujah but that's what they were designed for is that right but let's go to Genesis so you don't have to turn there I'm just saying in Genesis we find out that the Bible created Adam and we we went through that he created Adam spiritually then he phoned him out of there that's in the ground and he was Adam but there Adam looked around and he saw mr. and miss cow mr. and miss horse mister miss sheep whatever whatever the animals he saw - right and what did it do it drew a loneliness can you imagine I can't imagine how it would beat yes I could Amen a minute I can imagine by God's grace living in this mansion with all these rooms that that could be filled with children and grandchildren and everything else and I'm just by myself I believe I would get lonely hallelujah and that's the way God was he got lonely that might sound strange but he never said it but he said it through Adam because Adam was the god of the earth Adam could speak to the wind and say winds peace be still he could tell a tree to pluck up a man and move that's why I Adam was design he came on this earth to be the god of the earth the heaven father was God of heaven and Adam was a little God God of the earth that's why Adam could name all the animals without making a mistake he did not wake one mistake why he and God was one Adam was the very reflection of God hallelujah so you must understand he meant inside of Adam was a feminine spirit he was male and female y'all believe that let's turn to Genesis quickly I'm gonna get to the battle part in just a minute Genesis 5 please let the Bible speak here so you understand where I'm working so we realize that man here was Adam which was a reflection of God Genesis at the first book is the beginning of it of the Bible amen in Genesis the fifth chapter let's see how it reads this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him listen to this male and female created he them and blessed them and call not his name but their name Adam in the day when they was created so in the day that they were created it was male and female is that right and in there their names were Adam that means you had mr. Adam and mrs. Allen right so when God would say Adam they would say yes Lord they both turn right it's like if we had two or three people in here by the name of John I would say John you look and somebody said which one right Amen so we realized God's grace God in Adam and so what was Adam what was God reflecting there was a feminine part there was a part in the spirit and you said who are they that's us see we're liking us to the church we're like an ass to the feminine part of God hallelujah he's all-powerful he's Almighty hallelujah but we were in him like Adam and Eve was in Adam hallelujah and before the fall her name was Adam it was after the fall she gate became II God gave her a new name because now she was reflecting something different than her husband ooh so it's not complicated I'm saying all of these things because because of the fall of man which came by way of Eve but the Bible said Adam was to transgress her that means Adam knew better Eve was deceived hallelujah that's why it's so easy for the church to be deceived hallelujah but God said in this last day if it was possible the elected would be to see why because my sheep heareth my voice and estranged that they will not follow it's something about the name of Jesus something about hearing his voice you can't explain it but you know truth when you hear it is that right oh you think about it think about it he was the disciples Amen mining their business Peter them fishing and everything else and Jesus walked Owens they come follow me and the man quit his job and follow Jesus why because Jesus was his shepherd he was Jesus knew his sheep heard him it was in a different dimension hallelujah his voice didn't go just as a natural ear but his voice went to the soul and when the Word of God can quicken your soul to what is truth that is the voice of God hallelujah see you got to understand because we have two thoughts remember in this battle this battle started in in before the foundation it was Lucifer who raised up against God is that right the Bible said that God who is the holy ghost said you you have said in your heart now Lucifer had not even spoken when he was feeling and we don't know how long he worshiped God he was God's right-hand man he was a holy cherub that's why he's the master of music oh yeah oh yeah who can touch some of the voices he's God he looked like he picked the best of all he just hadn't found the church long enough there's some faucet that'll make some of them voices in Hollywood look shame be shame right I've heard him hallelujah but never let's go on we find out so that's what about was God's will versus Lucifer will that's your battle right now every day battle are you battling whether I should do God's will or the devil's will right thanks to Lucifer you have that that you have to fight with hallelujah and in his life we don't know how oh he preached that lie but the Bible said are thoroughly angels I read it today the third of the angels followed Lucifer and guess what we called them demons right you see these demons could not get into the human race as long as they stayed on the word but when the serpent beguiled Eve it brought in a way where the devil could enter into manhood mankind right so now because of him you part partly in the image of God and partly in the image of the devil y'all have seen those cartoons right God on the right hand and the devil on the left that's inspired I think right because Paul said whenever I'm trying to do good evil is always there present so now we're battling I'm working with something here because I want you to understand that this battle this thing that we live in Christians are called to war is that right Christians are called a walk we didn't come to have a great picnic even though God give us joy he give us peace he give us explain it he'd give us joy unspeakable like I was tell us about the other day I said when I'm in a church setting or when I'm talking about Jesus of God I'm excited you know what I tell you what brother brother Jared I almost got I almost got out of hand last night they were at the graduation Christopher graduated last night we didn't find out to the last minute but we're gonna have a thing for him at the house my wife is gonna organize something but they saying that Battle Hymn a republic oh my god I want to shake everybody here oh they were profession based on that thing and if I could identify everyone um I will shoot everyone I'm hand and even the director saying oh my god I was sitting back there I was I was tearing up I'm like Lord don't let me cry I was best I was so and another thing I was reading where I was so blessed because I didn't know that schools were still allowed to say anything about God I said Lord blessed us ankeny school that's how good it was to me it was so good even my wife came out talking about it and and crystal said I can't get over it was just so professional so yeah it touched me I tell you what yeah that was the best graduation service I've ever gone to seriously even all the three speakers everyone um has something to say it was short and sweet it was wonderful nothing boring about it at all I'll tell you what I wish everybody would have been able to experience that but anyhow you look at these things and I thought Lord God somebody you got and eat those kids I don't know who all were there but some of those kids sang that song from the heart because only what comes from the heart touches the heart it encouraged my soul so much so we realized by God's grace that when God in this battle because we can't see and God can see the future you didn't know that that's what prophets are prophets are seers that in whom God ordained to be able to see into the future for example Noah nor was a mighty warrior is that right he was he was a mighty warrior and you know this thing about it is people don't believe that God still have them but they still available God still use me and God still have prophet gods have prophetess God have preachers God have teachers God still have his army and we find out by God he's the same yesterday today in Vera Hebrews 13 and 8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever whatever God did for Israel he must do it for us but in a greater measure right see because people don't understand people look at Israel and Israel is she is she is wonderful but Israel is the servants of the Lord they are called what we call the temple guards right they are the tribal people that protected the king in the Queen oh it's the truth is the truth see they said you had 12 tribes here 12 12 12 lion lamb ox eagle you had all four those tribes under those banners so when they go out the water trot the trouble go you know that's bad for trumping but the truth of the matter is the trumpets sounded and one tribe Dan would run out right at ravenous will run out a man then hot the wild if we got Ian kids all for them but they're there up there they were obligated to keep the Ark of the Covenant safe and that Ark of the Covenant represented God Almighty hallelujah oh come on somebody I'm getting a little excited because you and I must understand that also that represented who the bride because that's where the blood was placed on the mercy seat and those angels that Alpha and Omega set right there protecting what we call the hole in the Holies of Holies the bride of Jesus Christ so let's go on because remember that even in in the garden you had two trees you had a god and a tree of knowledge of good and evil that's what we happen to happening now in other words Satan Trey uh Adam trade in the Tree of Life for the tree of knowledge of good and evil reason being the devil and I'm going here because this is the warfare the devil Towey I will make you a god has he done it in the last day we have seen women and I say this in a respectful way they are so beautiful they come out beautiful yeah yet note the truth there were times when babies would be born ugly now they come out beautiful beautiful hair beautiful collection yeah and then they grow up right and now women are worship now don't I'm not a chauvinist I'm just saying it is reality if you're gonna sell a truck you're gonna use a woman if you go sell a boat you're gonna use a woman if whatever you go at you you're gonna use a woman right if you're gonna even a song you what you're gonna have you're gonna have a woman what you call your trunk that's right you ain't gonna call him Adam it's just she's workshop in America a few years ago to establish the fact that a god of America is the woman when you come into New York who's standing there with her miss statue right he promised it he did it he is the god of this age that's why people worshipping zombies and worshipping vampires at work what is it people you are in a battle you are in a war and most people don't even know there are in a war they think all of these things are common but understand Satan like you see the television okay i'ma go to this because now you're dealing with dimensional things right you can't see these pictures that's flowing through here but they are if I had a television all I had to do is click it on and you see it right there television is a thing of eternity you understand me is able to tap go beyond time and bringing it to now right it could go all the way into England which is on a different time zone and bring it to you and says now this is lie it's daytime there and nighttime here see that's what television does it is a dimensional thing that could catch the unseen and bring it to the scene am I making sense but all of these things are used for battle because understand Satan could not move as fast as he wanted to with just a telegram or what's that Kaaba code they used to do yeah he couldn't do it fast enough so science invented us an instrument where it could use now watch this now because that same instrument could be used in a mighty way for the gospel but you see everything had to cover the whole world in a short period of time right after World War two everything exploded Amen it got so bad two peoples they were all there must be Martians there were no Martian ain't no space aliens if there is any alien you are the ones cuz you came from a different world he came from God let me move on I'm saying all these things because we don't understand the inspiration about about all these things be stained and like I said it's good and evil there are things you can see on TV that's good and things that are evil everything is good and evil right school is evil but then school could be excuse me school is good but school can also be evil huh because too much intelligence will take you away from the fact that there is a God we're living in Laodicea right nothing wrong with getting your doctoral degree you can get as many as you want as long as you still believe there's a god but the truth of the matter is it's difficult to witness to people because now you've got to convince them that there is a god there's nothing new Under the Sun even even even Solomon said there's nothing new Under Sun what was yesterday is now what is now will be tomorrow that's what he says nothing new you know we think we so intelligent in this age we do but before we admit that the Bible is right we would give the credit to some alien force some alien force came down and built the pyramid hallelujah some alien force came down and built the Sphinx huh well who would have known I'm gonna tell you who knew God the same God that told nor to build a boat he built it and he survived and he and his family what did they say do you understand those tidal waves that was coming in Noah's day was probably taller than the mountains that that he sat down on when that map that they rolled back in all the animals deep freeze dry freeze whatever you want to call it they found the mamak up in in in Atlanta Alaska with food in its mouth still scientists know things they're not telling you folks because if they tell you the truth there then you would have to come to the conclusion like Einstein there's a God so anyway let's move on because that is the devil the devil don't here here you know it's so funny about him he he makes people believe that there is no God but the Bible said the devil believes and he trembles huh and to me you know you got people and I don't know why I'm on this thing because mine I'm not into my nose but my thing is this you know I think it's difficult don't you think it's difficult more difficult to believe in evolution and it does the Bible the Bible is so much easier I cannot believe that I evolved from some tadpole and think because if we still evolve and look what it's turning into science is limited if you put science above God then you make science God and then you can find out through history science always lie and they always have to correct when they started with the first automobile this there's no way of making riding that automobile and live 30 miles 40 miles an hour he'll die now you try to tell them who it what I'm trying to say is that science experiments trying to learn things when God has already told us hallelujah you love the Lord science has his place but when it's contradicts the Bible it's wrong because science says once a man is dead he's dead but Jesus got up out of the grave he lives how you know he lives in me science said leprosy can't be healed but how many lepers did Jesus heal how many lepers are being healed today still doing it I'm just a believer but but that's the battle that's the battle between good and evil right good and evil because you got to realize by God's grace amen that's the tree we eat all offer think about it so I'm a glooming home to my next thought this food we eat is the same food we ever ate then why are we getting older when we was evening when were younger oh my we were growing up being strong but after a while the same food we eating we're dying from it why cuz God told Adam I need the data to eat of this tree you should surely die so we're battling we're battling good from evil and most of the time the people that stand with God you look crazy you look odd you know you know he's the strange he's off somewhere yeah but it's okay because you know we are people we just oddballs because we really believe that this Bible is true is that right explain this to me this is a battle now think about it when you're a Christian and you like the Hebrew boys right you're the Hebrew boys and this dis man said listen if you don't denounce your god I'm gonna throw you into the fiery furnace hallelujah and the Bible tells us that these Hebrew boys Amen I like to call them in but the Bible said they're boys so that's what they are now we realize Amen that they stood there and they prayed and didn't get an answer Bobby doesn't say they even got an answer from God but they did say in other words throw me into the fire if my God doesn't answer my prayer I know he's still God and for me rather before I ever bow to you before I ever denounced my god throw me into the fire I love that see because I want you to understand God is the all-seeing one he sees everything every move you make every thought you think God is in control of it all I don't know how he does it but he is but I do know one thing God must have heard the conversation in heaven hallelujah and the Bible tells me that God Himself came and stood in the fire with them talk to them the King looked in that furnace of fires that I thought we put in 3o but boy I see four and he get he goes on and said the one must be the son of God see he's a heathen he didn't understand who it was but it was God in the fire because God is a fire and he is a consuming fire hallelujah whoo scientists are so smart they can't even explain what electricity is they really don't even know what fire is they don't know what it makes that make makes it live and they can say whatever they want say they know how to make it happen but they don't know why it happens hallelujah but God does he knows because he created it all right so let's go I'm talking about this is a war it's a battle we're living in the most scientific age there is hallelujah for the rich should be dead he had what they call the Widowmaker almost all his arteries closed and God sent the doctor and don't get me wrong I'm not against medicine but God could have just touched him and healed him but God sent a doctor in there did his science I walked in and said oh my god is that what you're supposed to look like he looked 20 years younger hallelujah what about our brother Stamper his two heart attacks struck him so hard in front part of his heart was dead what wasn't functioning do I have a right brother absolutely look at him now look at sister Alana what God has done to her hallelujah she didn't know what was going on in the end drawing up just nobody was telling her but she was shrinking in size God comes along and healer he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changed not I don't care what the churches have said you've got all these big mega churches and all they know about is dancing and shouting and speaking in tongues and running down now whatever they do it's alright but we want the real God ain't no use of me trying to serve God he ain't real I need a God that's gonna show himself that's what you know what I didn't I didn't believe how much have much with Christianity one time but my mother was stricken with cancer and she's pray she lived for 12 years because she asked God to let her live - my sister and I became of age where we could take care of ourselves but before my mom died my mom was stricken with liver cancer of the liver she refused to have a liver transplant and I shot my mom John does complete jaundice and she was still I mean just a moment from she hadn't been living but I heard my mama say Lord just let me go one more time y'all got to understand she said to my sister help me get up my sister helped her get up and she slowly moved to the restaurant and she had a bowel excuse me but that's what she did right and she felt so happy since then everything to me as a child that was a miracle I saw a woman that was just rest away from death yet she asked God I heard her with my oh my that was my miracle that made me know God was real and I said Lord if I ever come to serve you I want to serve the God my mama sir the one that's still the same the one that manifests itself I wish my wife was here so she can witness to me I was coming down we was coming from Chicago well not from Chicago pastor in Chicago and if the traffic was really bad and I didn't know which way to turn I'm trying to gather my my bearings and my wife said turn here and then I've moved her way oh my god wrong way to this day we don't know how we got out of that honestly if I told you what I thought you'd think I'm in crazy I'm saying and saying but there was no way we should have gotten out of that accident alive three cars was headed us in editors in different directions there was no way out and I still we we rolled four miles before we said anything to each other because we were just that shocked and that's time we did do one thing we said Jesus you know my if you ever hurt my wife she could call it and he comes to you know so amazing how God can do that but that's a battle you say a battle you think to yourself well why did God even allowed that he allowed that to increase my faith mmm God allows it because listen how would you know that God could answer your prayer if you never go through something where he could answer your prayer he has to allow Satan to put things in your way so that you will know that he's alive and well hmm the Bible tells us in isaiah 54:17 no weapons that is formed against thee shall prosper hmm let's the truth I could tell you years ago I was working for Ramadi in al I was told on me my manager who was the owner of the building believed the lie he came to me and he cursed me out knowing I was a Christian he literally wore me out and I'm begging him to try to get him to listen to what I what the truth of it is he didn't even want to hear the truth he carried on so bad I really was hurt because I loved him this man gave me my basically he came to the hotel and he saw my little jalopy my little piece of car he said that's mine he said oh no no no no you can't park that in front of my hotel he said how much you make it and I told he's oh no no no no we're gonna have to give you law so you could get you a better car that man gave me such a raise I got a car and my first house I'm telling you I'm telling you but that man suffered few months later he fell off of his tractor with a stroke he lost his hotel and he died but I was young I didn't know to pray for him I didn't know to pray for him because the Bible says it is better for you to tire millstone around your neck catch yourself into the sea than to fin the least of these I prayed for the young man that we we had an argument today and I said Lord it wasn't his fault it was mine y'all I'm telling you this is the truth there's a sister I told this testimony I feel like doing it before I go anymore went further with this remember the sister I told you about in South America in Georgetown she had been married six times I think it was six or seven to each a different man she had a child from each one of those men but this last man was a beater he beat her a lot and he'll remember what grandma said she came to our church folks and she wanted to be saved this lady was so worldly she didn't know how to talk in church he she is testifying and cursing at the same we let her go because that's that was her language she didn't know no better I was glad they didn't stop her and one of the brothers said well who gonna baptize her because she's been there I said yeah you remember the toy inventor I was with us and me and Ron took pleasure in baptizing that later Danette when we got there to the house I think a couple of days later she was there waiting worshiping God giving the tithing and everything else and she's still example they shook their village a man but she was at the marketplace later and somehow this man was a wicked man he literally threw her while they would cuz in Guyana this portion of Diana you have to travel by boat you know because it's so much water and she's traveling by boat with this water and this man and he's trying to kill both of them so he throws the baby overboard and she has to jump out to save the baby I don't know how she got back in the boat how salvation I don't know but I do know one thing she had been praying and this is the testimony I didn't hear her say this but the pastor told me she had been praying Lord I know I made a lot of mistakes but deliver me from this man please deliver me she was really crying out to the Lord because she wanted to be a free woman so this man meets her at the in the marketplace and he fainted beto and I don't know what her prayer was I really don't but this man he got so frustrated he said I just wish I was dead fell dead right there in the marketplace and the people thought she was doing some kind of witchcraft no he cursed himself God had his number is that Alright touch not my anointed and do my prophet no harm that's the Word of God you say God do things like that yes even when I was in denomination it happened one of those old faithful sisters her husband was a beater he come home all drunk and ready to beat her amen but this time he went across the line he went up Amen to strike her he was struck with a stroke a stroke guess what she had to roll him around in a wheelchair until he died who loved him he loved him she took care of him I never I saw the man I knew him I didn't know him but I'd say I met her husband garlic sister loving the Lord why are you saying these things he because the Bible says no weapon formed against you shall prosper is that right every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the service of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord hello it's not all brother blue superdude isthat the other no I bear his righteousness he became my sin that's the beauty of the cross he became my sin that I might become his righteousness you should have all you make mistakes but I'm his righteousness he has declared that that's how I get to heaven not by my works in my deeds I get there because of his grace at his mercy because he declared me righteous is this okay do I have a little bit more time Alleluia so we looking at this thing he said oh this God tries too hard I'm gonna tell you something every one of us are dead ordained amen you'll be a being here's ordained a few months ago you never thought you'd be here right some of us years ago I didn't know do you really think living in South Carolina I would come to Iowa no way Jose absolutely not I hate cold weather hallelujah and you know this miss Iowa can be bad this time she didn't want to let us go she she she kept her who went to kept holding us a man who rich was pleading with Allah let us go let this free come in then she jumps from Springs summer but my point is is this God brought me here I'm glad I wouldn't have never known you our paths would have never crossed people call me crazy me and you leaving this big Church to go over there ain't up about 13 people that how'd it go take care you gonna be taking care that's a god gonna take care of me if he called me to do anything he's his obligation hallelujah now think about this God how he God never gives up on us in spite of all our failures hallelujah God knew you was gonna fail him before he saved you hallelujah let me tell you something it doesn't make any difference how bad my children are they're mine and I had to learn to love them unconditionally why because I wanted to love my children as God loves me hallelujah no matter how bad they are they're mine and I do whatever I can do to help them my flesh might not won't be some time to do it but I love them and I have to remind myself it could have been me alright so you look at these things and you said well what do you mean think about it Samson God raised him up right y'all have heard the story of Samson Samson was raised up unless judges seven you can't look that up he wrote ooh but he was oh I'm sorry that's Gideon I'm working with Samson any men but let's go back to Gideon y'all remember Gideon Gideon a man was fighting but for his rights a man and we realized by God's grace amen that that Gideon see God want you to understand he you don't need everybody if Bobby even said we're two or three are gathered there I'm in a mess that means I don't have to feel him I don't even have to see him cuz he promised that he'd be there that means he's there God keeps all of his appointments right it's good to feel him and though saying but even when I don't feel him he's there and I know by God's grace Amen that here was Gideon Gideon God said Oh Lord if you be God let me do this God did it put the free snip mmm Flynn sees that everything got Gideon asked for God did it he still wanted to make getting a believer because he knew that in his heart he really was a believer but Gideon like that his own stuff and that's how some believers are they like they feel it is that right I feel it was Thomas was the same way Thomas said I ain't gonna believe that Jesus was raised from the dead unless I see him with my eyes and I can thrust my hand into his room then I will become a believer Jesus walked through the walls and said Thomas hallelujah see what people don't understand oh my god is that God is not so far away he's closer to us than we realized and people say I was in I was in I was in the University of South Carolina in my in my composition class and this professor start talking about Jesus he's now if you're gonna talk about him talk good because if you don't I'm coming up and that's what happened he's trying to tell the people that Jesus I stood up I was rude cuz though I was I wasn't mature at that time see I challenged him in his own class which could have meant some bad stuff but he admired me after I did that because now I wasn't speaking on my own it was God spoke to me I said I said well how can you say that God doesn't exist that Jesus don't you know I said that's like telling Christopher Columbus that America is not here it doesn't exist there's no new land I said you gotta understand faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen something in you tells you that this thing exists whether you see it or not he what about the man who our Benjamin Franklin some about something told him that that electricity that lightning could be harnessed hallelujah thank God for Benjamin Franklin he had a vision he had an understanding that there was some things that he could not see but he knew it existed and he went for it Christopher Columbus and all we wouldn't even be in America because people said the earth was flat you're gonna fall off of it but there was a man who had a greater vision why because America had to be discovered because she's in the in the scripture hallelujah yeah revelation 13 America is there hallelujah where do you think the woman ran into the wilderness this is America where she was safe from the dragon this is America we were born white on freedom of religion because the old world was persecuting all Christians that was not of their organization come on yes to truth so we realized by God's grace all of this thing happened and people who are America ain't in the Bible then the Bible is not made whole there's no such thing as something popping up and it's not already in there let me go on by God's grace so what Gideon said God said listen you got 3,000 you gotta cut it back it's too many too many soldiers right and so here Gideon said God said I'm gonna tell you listen I love about it God hand-picked the people God knew who was ready and God knew knows when you're ready right and god said the people that goes down and don't even look up just slapping like a dog down in there he said I don't want them he said but that man they laughs up like this he's ready he's ready for war right the other ones just let him go on back home all right see that was God's dealing and then God told Gideon just how to fight the battle don't you understand if God told Gideon how to fight the battle God will also tell you how to fight it right he is the captain the orders come from him you got trouble on your job you gotta ask God how do I fight this battle no matter what and sometimes God said I'm gonna walk you through Jericho hallelujah amen because that's what he did in Jericho right he told Joshua he said Joshua I'm taking you over here and now the wall city is all walled up didn't heard about what you've done down there in Egypt how did you you defeated Pharaoh forty years later forty years ago they still talk about how these group of Israelites defeated Egypt for years we don't even know how to old rehab work when it all happened but however she told she was told she believed the report right so she goes down in there amen and God says listen I want you to march around Jericho and Jericho was a pretty good city right it's all like like launched around Ankeny however but my point is you had to march around neck that city wall and you had to keep your mouth shut sometimes when you are in battle God don't want you to say one word why because your mouth will tell the enemy where you are right don't say a thing March around the wall he also ain't none to it yes it was to all them children and whatever else they had they had to say don't see nothing have you ever tried to keep a kid quiet it's difficult amen so we realized by God's grace they march around this wall one the this city and listen this city wall was so big you can race chariots on it so what not no look thin-walled like that it was so big you could build houses that's where Rahab house was built on the wall March around it seven times and alone on the seventh day March around seven times so they had to do all this and he said now listen when I'm ready for you I have already delivered this city into your hands this is what I like a lot of time we fighting about and we don't understand that God has already delivered it he's already answered it for you but you because you are in time you got to come to that time right and so you said oh my goodness Lord and he said but what when it when I'm ready for you to shout I want you to blow his horn I'm gonna need all y'all shout I want you to shout the name of the Lord however he said it in me but I want you to understand when you do this I'll bring those walls down oh if I could have only been there to see that Amen because you can imagine what those people in Jericho what are those holy rollers doing now what are those silly people doing now we don't even see that god that was the problem with Egypt they had so many gods they had to see and here was it was Moses God you couldn't see but what they didn't understand that Moses God was right in pharaoh's face because the god of Moses was in him hallelujah the fire that was in the bush and I was in the man that's the mystery of it all oh let me hurry up folks you know the thing I love it about because God said I'll never leave you nor forsake you and I think I testify to that one day I was in my kitchen and I heard the Lord say that to me and I just jumped and I began I wept and praise the Lord like you wouldn't know I was just me and nobody else was in the house I wasn't disturbing nothing and nobody but it was showing how good I'll never forget it because God from nowhere spoke that to my heart you say how you heard I heard him that's all I could tell you well well inaudible and it was in a way I hurt him so you said what I mean yeah that's that's the way it goes anyway let's move on so you realized by God's grace that when God give orders now think about it God doesn't tell you everything sometimes you want to see how much faith you got because faith is the substance of things hoped for right by faith God it's like a father and son he wants his son to develop into what he is if that makes sense everybody like when you have a son oh yes and you know that's how it is then when you first get married you hope that boy come out looking like you when I first had my first baby and it was a girl I was disappointed but then when I saw how pretty she was I got happy I'm being honest right and then when Isaiah was born I saw I was like they're watching cuz we didn't at that time we didn't have where you could go see if you did we didn't do it anyway so I'm in the labor labor delivery room looking just watch it and see what was good what was right soon as I saw was a boy I was out of control I ran oh man but my wife had a first checkup they said the doctor says your husband's still jumping amen so look we look at these things and you say oh lord have mercy but here it was God didn't tell Moses and God don't always tell you the next step but understand this the steps of a righteous man they're ordered by God God is already ordained your footsteps is not oh I'm gonna go this way no God will order your footstep if you go wrong like like Joe excuse me uh like Jonah if you go wrong like Jonah he'll make you go right all right Jonah running from the orders of God he ends up in the whales belly see you can't get away from his wheel who's gonna counsel him who's gonna tell him he's wrong who's going to judge God at the end of the day we all have to stand before him right we've seen what's happening to Lucifer read the back of the book who want to help who want that ending anybody not me not me mm-hmm I love God too much to want to go to hell like I said if don't go there they're gonna be in trouble because I feel about way I feel about God here whoo thank you Jesus I'll mess up his hell you know me I mess it up but anyway by God's grace it's the truth if you love him here you love him there it doesn't displace your death changes nothing if you love him here you'll love him there wherever you go your loving but anyway let's move on so Moses not told everything and now he's got two children either this is bad now because he's not telling he told Pharaoh in the beginning let my people go fair so I'm not gonna let him go now you got a battle between forces good and evil right and so now Moses doing all of these things and God doing these things with Moses and you know you know what we didn't even have fleas until Moses called for he created fleas it was the same that turn into bugs honey oh and you said oh is that was the thing about it the magicians could do everything Moses did but they couldn't take them away if Moses said let there be frogs they said let them come frogs they have frogs frogs in the bathroom frogs in the shower prowlers in the sink frogs in the refrigerated frogs everywhere hallelujah but they didn't know how to get rid of them they came to Moses again help us out Pharaoh Moses got rid of them but the whole point is this after a while Pharaoh's heart say take your kid take whatever just leave your you know a little bit of here and a little bit of there Moses said I'm not leaving one hook behind every one of us leaving this think about it here was the slaves read the Bible here's the slaves leaving Egypt with all the spoils all the gold all the silver all the diamond everything they could carry the cattle they lamb they whatever here they mostly take it I'll get get out of here and Moses all Pharaoh saying all this and Moses all happy and everything and he's taking praise the Lord we've gone through our promised land right but he doesn't understand that God got something up the road because a lot of time you think the storm is passing know anything something else comes right so that's what happened he's thinking is all over he gets at the Red Sea mountains on one side the waters right on the other side here come Pharaoh in his army now that's just shows you how trials can make you doubt in the skinny minute I'm coming from Exodus 2:14 and we find out that Moses got a little upset because the people accusing him what have you done have you caused us to leave Egypt so we can die out here they're always come and look at the charity we don't know all they said but one thing for certain it made Moses a little nervous and Moses began to cry out to God right he cries out to God and God says why you crowd at me why cry speak I've given you the authority right so when that thing comes to Moses he takes his rod and he speaks and then the sea opens up people don't believe that the pillar of fire exists I've seen it I've seen the pillar of cloud people say well I don't know about that when I was in in in India I was preaching the pillar cloud came down it looked like smoke like they pretending now they do the churches there we didn't have a machine it was the real thing those Hindus ran to the altar gave their hearts to Christ was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I've seen it with my own eyes Moses began to speak to see open and they walked out on dry land people say dad didn't happen even theologian says no he sent them to read the water of the reeds there you know I've been to Egypt one time I never go back there ever ever ever unless I get a dust at the Lord from God it was the worst place I had ever visited all of my and all of my vacation thieves little games like this I saw the boys beating up on the women the little girls beating them like men and it's against the law for a woman to hit a man she could be thrown in jail or stone or whatever the case may be yeah so that little girl couldn't do nothing she just let that little boy beat her up and then stole stuff out of our our our luggage before we got to the hotel wicked place that the man that was the guide told us you can find whatever you want in Egypt any time in the day me and my wife said we stand if we stand in this place been going out let everybody else go out if they want to and it's went out and got food poisoning oh my god so anyway let me hurry I hope I'm not being too long but I'm trying to tell you something people we are in a position where we're not the only ones right this is what right we're like everybody else we can get off just like everybody else can get off but how you stay right is when you could continue to believe this Bible you believe this word every bit of it you said well it was written by me and the Bible said it was inspired by God men only wrote what they were inspired to do and God was the one who had the real ink pen that's why we don't believe by God's grace that we have men in this by in the thing that can literally change this Bible into what they call the NIV because the NIV Bible takes away takes away passages of Scripture not just words but passages and what it does it keeps you away from the truth and if by one word it brought us by disobeying me and one word brought us in this condition how are we going to get out of it by taking more the word out of it you can't do it Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever right the only person we're trying to point people to is the Lord Jesus Christ right so you can see let's turn the Hebrews 13:8 I'm a close here you know this is this is what we're going to be working on for a while Hebrews 13 and eight you know we it's just a strange thing because you know what it's so amazing think of how difficult it was let's read this Hebrews 13:8 and then I'll comment and then I'll let you go Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever that means he changed not is that what God told Israel know that the LORD thy God he is one and their God says if there'll be another God I don't know him and Jesus in st. John 10:30 says I and my father are one and I find out that in this day you know people we've had a lot of strange thing follow through a lot of strange things you know all kinds of copes and variations of the scripture and I thought to my day I thought to myself what would Jesus have looked like here he was a single man and he's got 12 disciples following him no matter where he goes they actually seem to be against all the systems because here Jesus told the Pharisees he says your father is the devil say you hold the truth in unrighteousness so you know I am the truth but you won't tell your people that you're standing right in the door and you won't go in and you won't let your book your people go in and that's how it is today you've got to realize that if I was out to fame and fortune I wouldn't be here if I was here so I could preach so you can like me because of what I preach I wouldn't be here because I you why I preach I preached because I preached the truth I know I've got something that some others don't have not because I'm good not because I've been good it's God's mercy it's God's grace like I said the other day I've gone through almost every denomination before I got here I got tired of all of the stuff all of the pomp all of the pretense and whatever more they were going on and I said God where are you and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and says I'm in my word so now I God sent me someone that knew God and His Word was one in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God still is today and I knew that this is this Bible I don't care a thousand people put it together why do the world hate it so why have they tried to tear it away take it away they've tried to change and look at all the churches now that you know you know I had a friend of mine said well it makes it easier to read hello what are you talking about you're reading it and you're reading the wrong revelation of it what do you mean let me say it like this what makes a car understand a cow because it's a cow then we have to go to school to learn cow language with we're falling that's why we have to learn English a language but if you listen to all the babies they cry the same in in Japan Japanese and Chinese and why they come here singing the same song they cry when they're hungry they laugh when they're happy you know but it's because we're falling bable bable bable we become Babel all right and we've had to teach these things to them a horse is not falling he never sinned he doesn't have to go to school says now when you born in a few more minutes you're gonna stand up of your feet and there's gonna be somebody they're gonna instruct you instruct you on how to go feed from Mama's past it's in them because they're not falling we're the only falling creatures and because we're falling we get lost but one thing about cows one thing about sheep I don't care if there's a thousand sheep out there and that loose that that that little sheep getting mixed up in the bunch that mother can hear that bleep and she'll find him or that little little sheep will find his mother why it knows the mother's voice that's how it is in the spirit if you truly one of those that God has ordained to eternal life I don't care it down the road how long it takes there'll be a word there'll be something that's gonna strike you and you'll know you know my sheep here is my boys not my sheep I don't have any it's his sheep and this message what we're preaching like this is all over the world I don't know much myself but what I know is true is what I preach and there are Christians all over there Christians and every denomination every organization that need to hear what truth is and that's what I've been ordained to do tell the truth be wise in my teaching and telling it but I know what is truth and you know I look at I look at things and I say to myself you know I am the least of all God's servants I don't say that to flatter or to make like I'm trying to know that's the way I feel that's the way I believe but I do know one thing that I know him and he knows me and what has amazed me about God is that no matter how many times I make mistakes he's always there when no Raina's around who's there singing in my ear you ain't no devil gonna saying to me I'm so doubt I didn't got no song on my heart and here he comes it wasn't my mind my mind don't know how to tune into that hallelujah y'all remember on New Year's I'm closing now New Year's right here it is we sing it in y'all know we don't sound good when we sing awesome bosses it was turn y'all know all of a sudden we sing in our what was it hallelujah and that angel choir came down I thought I was losing my mind I really did and here I was in my house talking my daughter I said I tell you what I'm almost afraid to say that I said but I heard angels singing she broke she started rejoicing you cry insane tearing down she said I thought I was I was I thought it was just me I was afraid to say anything and how many we got about 12 witnesses who heard that choir the pitch was too perfect it was beautiful it wasn't the first time I ever heard that I was testifying about this same thing there at the airport and these two ladies were sitting in and they were shaking my hair like that poor so he really believes that kind of a star and I'm looking at him and I'm saying you a poor soul see when I when I was young I heard this same choir down there dear brother Simmons and I'm telling you we you took my devil's cast out of people and all that I seen with my eye I didn't even you know I heard it but when I saw it I said every Christian need to see a demon cast out every Christian it scared me how I'm serious I'm laughing but I'm just telling you as a young Christian it scared me y'all think that stuff y'all see on the TV estate that lady eyes turned blood-red she started selling like pigs sounds of birds came out of and she was moving like a serpent seen it with my own eyes I ain't the only one that's seen it and she was sneaking herself right up to that pulpit like like she was coming my way and as a rule Lord Jesus I said this thought what's the same way I said whatever I did freeze don't let it come and be God delivered her to but I've seen it with my own eyes I was believer from then on that that stuff is real you know and but anyway and all of this I'm saying we are battling and God challenged that service with that lady's condition and God healed her God delivered her I've seen too much to notice that it's real I've seen it just convincing others that that they're just it's more to this world than just living and dying like I said in closing you could stand in the end of this whole thing you and I must realize we're at a battle it's good and evil there's nothing in between it's good and evil and you and I know by God's grace amen you and I can't live it I can't live good I tried it with my mom living I tried to live good I couldn't do it and every weekend I went and I did my thing to the faith to the point I ended up with a gun in my head trying to commit suicide and God delivered me from that and he saved me a week later however long it was he saved me and we're not God took all that stuff out of me like he did I just thought I was an angel didn't know down the road I had battles to face yeah joy you better enjoy that joy when his friends could the battles coming but I've never had a mind to turn back ever but all can dessert I'm gonna take my god is real he's real in my soul my god is real for he has lost and maybe he left me it's just like you gold my god is real I can feel him in my show some judge some fault-based gone in all can deter any me alone but I'm gonna take my god real in my heart I can just win Jesus wash all of your sins away but ever since that day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in my do you feel him when you know he's dead you can be like David he said though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I fear no evil for thou art with me if people could just read the back of the book there come to see that it is a law and Satan is defeated and all of his angels and the demons and everything is cast into the lake of fire a man the Bible said he deceived the whole world all whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life that's a lot of people one escaped death and that was Enoch and Noah day was 8 think about it if there was eight million it was one out of a million and escaped the flood and if God said it was going to be like that in this day as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah as only three they're only three and as it was the days of Noah 1 excuse me right think how small the percentage will be this yeah this time Israel is this nation all of the things that happening the earth is quaking volcano's eruption disease on the rampant you know lawlessness is what this world has become how much longer and if God would not judge this world he have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize we know by God's grace that God has sent a way of escape he promised he would in every age and now we know by God's grace today is our time today is our day you know you have a song sir okay let's bow in a word of Prayer father God we come before you lord as humbles we know how been a little lengthy tonight but I
