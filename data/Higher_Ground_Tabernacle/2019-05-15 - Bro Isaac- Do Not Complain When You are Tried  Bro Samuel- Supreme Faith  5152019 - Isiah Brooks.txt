Church we thank God for this moment and we thank brother Brooks for letting us here and we thank you all for coming tonight hey let's go let's go to him and pray your first dear God Lord we thank you Lord for this time garden we ask you Lord Jesus Christ you take this body Lord and music Lord God you know Lord that by myself I cannot do anything good or that I need you Lord help me Lord I need you Lord I'm waiting on you Lord Jesus Christ Lord bless the heart who we receive and bless me Lord Jesus Christ speak through me Lord that's all we need God we thank you for everything you read us law from the beginning Lord until the end Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I mean as we all know it's a first day first time to stand in to say something and let's open our Bible in the book of numbers the numbers 11th chapter verse 1 in verse 2 Amanda Bible says and when the people complained he displeased the Lord and the lower heard it and his anger was candle and the fiery of the Lord burn amount him and consumed them that were in the other most part of the camp let's turn our Bible to 1st Corinthians chapter 10 you read the verse 9 to 13 the Bible says neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the Serpent's neither murmur ye as some of mosul murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happened unto them for example and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there is no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but we're about will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it amen let's pray Lord as a prophet was saying everybody can open Lord turn the pages of this book but no one can give although God explained it Lord we need you Lord to come and use us Lord Jesus Christ in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated and as I was saying I thank everybody for coming you know wake coming here I serve brother buck steaks saying that you'll be the first one who were going you only have 5 to 10 minutes and guess what happened after that we got pulled over by the postman just right here and well we say well nothing happens God God knows why he happened he has so tonight we have a little subject that want to share it so do not complain when you try it or do not complain when you test it because we know as the prophet of God says that every question we have to pass the third temptations we have to pass through tests he said that every Christians when we believe when we confess and say that we believe in Christ Jesus Christ we have to pass through temptation God has to test us and he gave an example of one of his sermon I was listening I think yesterday he said that one day was a man he was he had a vision to build a bridge and everybody older all the people who knew about building bridges came to him and say you know you're not going to build any bridge there because there it's impossible for you to breathe there cause the sand is now good so it's not good and everything is bad but that meant stood and say you know I had the vision that I am going to build I am going to build a bridge right here and the prophet of God said that he had to test every instrument that he had that he was going to use he had to test every material has to test everything that it was going to use he said that it's the same thing with God that when God forgot to use you into his body forgot to use you for a certain purpose he has to test you to see if you really can stand he said that dumb man was not it was testing this thing not because of me but it was just think those are the materials that he was going to use because of his name he said that because when as I was talking to my brothers you know we're here I told them that God the man when someone built want to build something or he want to build a bridge or a house or something in engineer he has to make sure were that everything is doing is correct why because if it's not correct his reputation will be bad people with not give him anything else he said that's the same thing with God when he gives a word he has to try yes to test it when he gives a man when he put you into a service or you want to use you for something he has to test you to try you had to test you for powerful for the service the property oh my soul would cry hallelujah to God when I think that God puts in his church the best that he can find it the best that he can find God takes his children and test them with an acid test then he places them into a body of grass because they are tested they believe they went through the trials they had their faith and experience they are witness of ease they knew that they talk they know what they're talking about not just an intellectual conception but there have been born again of the precious Holy Spirit and time-tested and try until their souls are set like a flint tort recovery yes they are time tested they are weakness of his power and through that God is building a bridge from earth to glory that the wayfaring man may come on the highway sit down sit down under the tree in the cool of the day by time-tested materials those who take God at His Word no matter what the symptoms are no matter what the circumstances that God that doesn't stand in the way God has got time-tested material as witness and it faces it you know the Prophet is telling that when you go through the Bible's you will see every man of God or a vision of God has been tested where we read in numbers that they put numbers Moses wrote that this book he's talking about the tune of Israel we all know that it you know obviously you know of Israel spent our four hundred four hundred years in Egypt and they cried out to the Lord they say Lord come set us free they cried out to the Lord Lord please send the deliverer to set us free to let us go so that we may go I have noticed something that when the Lord answered their prayers the Lord sent to them Moses and they saw all the miracles that happened in Egypt they saw everything that God operates God God God all the miracles that God did and they saw how God has to add to divide the Red Sea so that they may walk but arriving in the desert there were tests by God God centimetres but instead of thinking of what God has still told them instead of thinking of what God did with them they began to comprehend against before they began to complain about what God did and we did we read here that the Bible says that God that didn't please God that displeased God why because God because God gave you something and you began to complain against him and the prophet of God said it's not good to complain and the Bible says that it's not good to complain against the Lord when we read I was reading one time in the book of Job I think the last almost the last chapter you see the Bible God told the the jobs friend it's all Easter let me say you when my son job was going through a hard time you didn't honor me with your words by you complained against me you spoke you spoke against me and now my rough is kindled against you so you have to go and repent so that's to say that complaining it's not good I looked at the dictionary while complaining means they say that it's mean it's the the when you not satisfied with something so when you complain that means that you're not satisfied with what God is saying or with what God is bringing you through but the Bible say that everything works well for those who believe in God so if God wanted you I wanted you to pass through a temptation if God wanted you to pass through a hard time that means that God knew why as my as my brother lease was saying they say that God always give us the best for you for example for you to pass through that's the best that God was given to you that means that when you have those things you have to trust God you have to be like sure you know we read the story of Job and we think that was easy for job chief to say those things but we realized that God was testing job trying to imagine something God was standing there and he called the devil they say you there what did you see my my son job right there did you see him you say yes I saw him but they say you know that man you can do whatever you want you won't you won't curse my name you we always stand for me and the devil told God they said you know what just take away everything you gave him and you will curse your name and stuff like that and the Bible says that God was trusting job and when the devil went to him the Prophet said that God when let done when God let the devil trust now to test job or to attempt job he said God was waiting for job to respond as God told Satan because God saw system that whatever you gonna do to him it will not curse my name so God was there silent was waiting to see what job will answer him or what job will say to the devil and we all know that job when did ever wondered ever came to me say the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh very breathless of it his name he said that should be the same the same answer we favorite Christian you know because is it that should be the same answer with every question when we Buster trials when we pass through temptation you know it may be hard that we cannot think you know you may be hard that way you think that you know life is not love well you know I will not live tomorrow or as you know something is going really bad and you think that you know tomorrow maybe we now wake up maybe as diseases or something else what you know just trust God he said it and he's going to fulfill it just trust his word that that's all he needs you need to trust is where the prophet of God said God don't need no education but God needs somebody a heart who we trust him so why don't you just trust his word why do you say you know when we look at this book of numbers I was reading The Book of Numbers and I saw that when God told the children of Israel to go to possess to go just by to the land to spite the land he said Moses sent spies to go there and when they came back they saw that the land was what God told them but one thing they saw that the head test before them they had things to overcome the head tests to pasture and you know many of them when they came back they said you I just quit I'm now going to do it no more I just quit I'm not going I'm not able to fight this test I'm not able to fight those men because they find the same that do demand that they had to fight you to fight was bigger than them and they will fight them and I love what the Bible says about Kelly the Bible says that Kelly steal the people because what he knew what God said God will fulfill him he knew what God said God will God before fear and with you read you read father you will notice that when Joshua also stood up Joshua repeat the same thing he said if God is with us we will overcome it if God is with us we will fight those people no matter how they are it's not us fighting but it's the Lord why because again he gave His Word and he has to fulfill it you know it's the same thing God saying that I will never give you a temptation or it's right that is that is beyond your abilities to overcome it so why don't you just trust God why don't you just say their Lord you say it and I just trust you I'll go to you and you say even though I gave your test that is now beyond your abilities I will be there to make a way of escape that's the Lord we have just to put our faith money we have just too pretty to trust him when and the Bible says that I was reading also the the the the story of the day in Hebrews children you know when they the prophet of God said the Hebrew children they spoke about the Lord in the city where they were they told everybody that you know we serve a God who is real and he does miracles things and the Lord wanted to test them about what they were saying because they said the prophet of God said because many people in the church we live with their mouth by in their heart they don't believe you know that's why God is coming to test you and to see if you really believe what you wear if you really believe what you say you know and he said that you know of Israel were there that he was stealing were there and the Lord put a test before them they had to worship the statue or that will be burned and they stood there they say we will not worship it because they learned they knew that the Word of God you will not have two or three gods before me there is only one God and they had to stand for the word of God because if you stand for the Lord the Lord will stand for you and they're still there and arriving when they respect what God said they say okay now you guys are going to be burned and so forever you guys are going to be burned and they came commanded you did you hear the fire seven times harder than he was and they were there walking and the prophet of God said that God was silent gods were watching them seeing if there will really keep the faith if they will really keep the faith and arriving there at that time and as he went the Gawain gods so that they kept their faith God came you know I was thinking that God came even before the answer why because realized the man who heeded the the defier themself the God killed but why God led them to go to them in the when God saw the trust when God saw their heart and he said now I have to come and I have to believe and I have to come to join my children because what it's my name it's not because of about my name they kept my name and I have to haunt it what I'm saying amen and uh okay I am all y'all wanted to to read the prophet or what you say we talked about the story of job the prophet I say he tried job and see what kind of to see and see what kind of reaction you will find in him but when it took his sheep and took his ox and took his camels and took his children and see God say I will see what job says now and he said the Lord gave and the Lord taking away let's say be the name of the Lord you say he found he found why he had to Satan he had a white herd why he had so Satan he had in job none like him on the earth you know it's the same thing that I give an example for example I am the teacher and brother Brooks also is a teacher I teach for example mathematics and I have my students I say you know I give them some exercises and I teach them out you to solve problems and itself to solve problems and all the exercise and brother Brooks games and say you know Isaac you know why I want to challenge your to your children to see if you're really if they really understand what you teach them and what I we do as teacher I would choose the best of my children to stand the test and I was telling when I would give him all the tactics and I would give him all the weapons and I would give him all the things that you can't do we can use to pass that test and try to imagine something I teach him for example the same thing that X plus one equals zero that means that x equals minus one and brother boosts comes and he gave him the same test and my team am i my student failed the test how would you feel you know it's the same thing that how God also can feel when he gives you the Word of God and you don't you know it's not because his word is not true by it's because you don't believe in this word that you felt it just and a prophet of God go farther it said if you don't believe the Word of God it's an insult to God and nobody wanna insult God that's why you know we have to believe it's him we have to believe in is where we have to wait upon the Lord the Bible says that they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength just wait just relax we'll go to God and pray go to him and pray wait upon him and is the one who will give he's the one who will give you strength is the one who will give you faith use the one who will do everything you know I I like the story of Job you know of object.observe you know Jacob after being with Lebanon after 11 left you know he sent his he sent his servant to go meet his brother and arriving there his servant comes back and they say you know what I'm an Easter coming with 400 men against you you know the Bible say that jrj kaffir but he tried as every man can do he tried to to find a way to fund the solution to the problem you know you say okay I'm going to divide my group into three groups so you go first if he meets you for example he will kill you and if you made the second maybe we'll forgive and then I will come myself do it and then you know the job be Jacob found out that that wasn't enough and maybe I was thinking maybe you heard a small voice in his horse saying why don't you try the Lord maybe you remember one of his his father sermon saying that trust the Lord why don't you go to him and the Bible say that George Jacob went to the Lord Jacob went to pray and he prayed he gave everything to God and he started to remember God you know to remember God what he's saying the Bible says that he be Jacob becoming began to say that Lord you promised my father that you will give him you will give him a seed that will be that will not be numbered so now look at my brother is coming to kill me so he began to remember they God you know you said this I didn't say I didn't tell you to say you said it and you have to stand for it and that's what Jacob did and you know what that was I think that was in the morning or in there in the day and then after that in the night the Bible says that Jacob met the angel and arriving there when he made the angel of God he fought with the angel and then he said he named that place opinion that means the God afraid I've seen God face to face and God preserved my life you know I looked at our word I say preserved laughs I say you know even though he so his brother could come and find him that we're not doing the hood because they say God preserved my life he made God face-to-face God preserved my life maybe you're going through a trial maybe you're going through a hard time maybe you going through or maybe you have problems maybe you you have many things to avoid many difficulties he may be financial you might be in your house or your children or yourself I don't know what else but God knows it God knows your problem God knows what you're going through and why don't you like jerko go to him remind him what he's saying you know the prophet of God said sometimes when the devil comes to teach and to attempt to you you say sometimes I remember what God say because he gave me strength you know if the same thing remind god what he's saying and it will do it it will honor you it has 200 the prophet of God said that before God pronounced something or before God send his word the prophet of God said God had to test the word that he's going to say he had to make sure that the word I'm going that they were that the word that I'm saying will not fail he had to make sure that the word where I'm gonna I'm saying we're not fair and the God the prophet of God said God has proven as proven that his word did not fail just meet the requirement that you know visit you know the Hebrew that they met the requirement they were prayed up they were waiting on the Lord and meet the requirement go to him it will me where it will give you solution you know he said in the word if you open to Matthew chapter 7 the Bible says let us really marriage up to seven verse 24 the Bible says therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon the rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and he fell not for it was founded upon the rock you know think of this verse see what the rain means it's not trials it's not things that can come to beat up did you not try us it's not hard time that can come think that what the floods mean it's not trials it's not hard time that we can't have but if you if you you read the Bible says that if you if you're here and do the Word of God do what is saying you know you do what he says he said it's like a man that built his house on the rock and we all know that the rock is Jesus Christ so if you do you hear the word of God and you practice it you know you will be it your faith in Jesus Christ no matter what can come the one no matter the flood can come the rain can come temptation may come trials may come hard time can come you will now move your faith because you have anchored your faith in Jesus Christ amen god bless you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how many I feel happy tonight is it okay if we just sing one more song before we go ahead a man let's sing into the chamber speak for you Holy Spirit amen whoa Oh into the chamber speed free always speak to me gently as I close the door heavy and we lava let thine raisins cover Shekinah [Music] Oh the chamber [Music] Lay Dying presents power she kind of odd in me is all whoa [Music] the chamber sweet [Music] as I close [Music] every libel lead I'm free it's cover shake hi [Music] amen just do your father we approach your throne of grace one more time nice evening father thanking you Lord for the spiritual fujas gave unto us father you just pray O God that may you pour down another dose of your Holy Spirit in our meetings o God speak to our soul Lord speak through the speaker and hear through the hear O Lord I humbled myself tonight as I yield all God saying come and take control Lord we want to hear you speak to us tonight in the end of it all we want to say Lord heal Leicester's in Jesus Christ's name I pray believing amen also still standing let's just open our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 the first verse he reads now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen we can take our seat tonight I want to speak on the subject Supreme fate amen going back to Hebrews 11 he says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen many times we go over this and not understand what it means because we have the conception that faith it's something that's virtual something out there in space but if you look into the dictionary and look for the meaning of the word substance it's something that you can touch just as sure as I'm holding this bottle that is faith amen and the evidence of things that we don't see we all know what evidence is it just means for sure that something is there amen um before I go forward I just want to thank the pastor for giving me this opportunity amen I just want to ask each and every one of you a question when you came in here to sit how many check you the edge here was gonna was okay if it was balancing well can you raise your hand no one did that was faith you had faith in that chair you didn't even hesitate before you set on it you knew that it was going to hold your weight Amen that's how simple faith is and the Prophet calls faith the sixth sense the sixth sense which stays in our soul and in our soul is either day is doubt of faith but we know for us believers there is faith I still remember when I was in a sixth-grade it was a Wednesday service after my dad had preached about faith the following day I went back to school and we were writing a test and in the test there was a question he says how many senses that does a person have and I remembered my dad had fries about the sixth sense and I wrote six I was so confident when I was writing my answer I looked at everyone else I knew they were gonna write five but I knew I had the ultimate answer amen we submitted our papers and then after our teacher finished grading it she called me out in front of the class it was a joke and I was mad I went back home I told my mom I said mom you heard what was being preached in church but this is what I wrote in school but I failed my test so she came back and she laughed about it and she told my dad then a later one explained Amen so this that is faith the sixth sense which shuts out all the other five senses Amen let's look at what the Prophet says about about faith how he explains it because many times we believe we think that faith is something that maybe a bishop or some huge person is supposed to have to be able to work out miracles raise the dead and we think that are just ordinary people we don't have faith or little but that's not the case as we said earlier on you said on your chair that was faith so let's read in armed blasphemous names well the Prophet talks about this i'ma try and read this slowly blasphemous names paragraph 143 the prophecies and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strike this there is a godly spiritual faith then what does that faith do that faith recognizes only the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word is still God amen and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation so each and every one of us when we are born as humans the Prophet is saying here we have mental faith but we as believers we are not ordinary people we have believed the message a man and now he says with that mental faith that you are in born with when the word itself is pouring into your faith that mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation amen and that makes it supreme faith different from every other person's Amen because we are at different people a man called for a higher calling hallelujah Amen and I want to read another quote from proving his word paragraph 64 the prophecies you can only have faith as God gives you faith faith is a gift of God ever how religious you may be yet it must take you must have faith and your faith can only rest if you're a Christian upon the proven Word of God amen we hear they're here now that faith is a gift from God so you do not have to worry whether you have faith or not because God gave you the faith amen many times we fly and get in planes but we never ask the pilot are you sure we gonna get there we don't do that we just have faith we know they're gonna take us there but when you pray for God to heal you you're gonna have doubt we start doubting is he really gonna do this that just gets me to think what my brother was saying that we are not trusting in God and that's an insult amen we trust in worldly things but it's hard for us to trust in God this faith I was talking about spiritual faith he just didn't come from nowhere we can trace it back to Abraham who is known as the father of faith and there is no father without children amen they just don't call Abraham the father of faith and he doesn't have the children of faith let us look in Galatians chapter 3 verse 7 to see who these children are Galatians 3 verse 7 know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham the person sitting next to you right now is the child of Abraham so we have faith in us passed down from Abraham when you repent when you become a believer when you accept Christ as your Savior but gene is attached to our DNA and it is genetically modified to us and we are now children of Abraham amen we were in his loins before the foundation of the world when Abraham was called by God we were in Abraham Amen do we believe it we had just told we are chilled we are Abraham's children amen when Abraham was given the promise when he was 75 years old we were with him and he waited for 25 years that's not a that's not a joke I'm not yet even 25 but he had to wait on God amen but we were with him amen you know I remember some time ago I used to answer my dad's phone so my mom called this other time and I picked up the phone so I told whatever I said then I hung up I forgot to talk to tell my dad that I had that I had my mom had called and I had talked back to her so when we got back home my mom said but when you called you say this you say no I did not he didn't call she said yes I did so I was away when they were talking about it I came back I said you know that was me so my voice was so similar to him I couldn't help it why because it was in the genes amen it is in the genes I couldn't help it now we have the gene of faith whether we like it or not we have faith aim we just have to exercise it a man let's read James to verse 26 it says for as the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also that's why many times you try to pray for something you see it does not work you have the faith but it is lying dormant in you you just have to work it out you know I believe most of you may be brothers mostly at some point in time you used to go to the gym and work out you know you start working out you see some development happening you see some muscles coming up that's because you are working out if you don't work out nothing comes out amen so this is what we are being told here faith without works is dead so you have to exercise it you just cannot wake up one day you want to pray for a dead person to raise but you have never prayed for a headache and it and it went you cannot do that you have to work at amen and we are told we have to work it so that we we we get more faith amen I just want to read this quote the Prophet talks about that analogy Amen you say his genuine faith doesn't take no for an answer it's got hairs on the chest it's big and burly it speaks and everything else sets down that's all amen when God said you are healed just believe it that's sixth sense it shuts out all the other senses amen if your sense of feeling says no I'm still feeling I'm still feeling some pain faith says shut up amen when you're feeling tired faith says no shut up amen because faith is the boss amen if the old you know feelings raise up and say you don't feel any different you say shut up faith we'll sit down God took over and that's it now well your stomach still hurting shut up don't even feel it that's it amen thus sure is looking at what God said God said so so faith believes it if you can just hold on faith on a letter just faith take over it makes the rest of them look like little Dwarfs a man it just makes them sit down because he is the boss got great big brawny muscles and I tell you everything else all feelings and superstitions and little isms and things just sets down when faith takes over he's the boss that's just right Amen that was in expectations amen we can see this with David in his own experience he just didn't come up to challenge Goliath no he did not at first he was in the wilderness herding the Sheep then a lion came down you know he's got his little sling he says let me try this it takes it let's go the lion is dead God gave him more confidence more muscles coming up a man he keeps on he's heading his sheep he's heading his sheep next time around a beer comes around he sees it he remembers but I've killed a lion before I can do it again a man he takes the slingshot put the stone in there he swings it and he lets it go and then the beer dies after some time when his father sent him with food to go give his brothers were in the army these brothers know nothing about the elite oh brother was you know the Shepherd in the desert them all soldiers and all that and then he comes up and he challenges Goliath he was not just talking from because he knew God did it before two times and he knew he could do it again amen that's why he got up with courage in front of all the hosts of Israel and he went to challenge the Philistines he got the stone put it in his sling he remember he looked at that he looked at that giant and he said I'm going to cut off your head and I'll feed you to the fowls of the air you just don't say that unless you know what you're standing on a man he was standing on faith he knew God had done it before and he was going to do it again he took his stone put it in the slingshot swing it swing it he let go he knew the job was already completed and the giant fell down amen he just did not wake up to do that but he was working it out while he was in the backside of the desert amen many a times in homes you know we have little situations that come up you just have a little tummy ache you know just pray about it it's alright to take medicine it's good it's good to take it but sometimes just pray work out that faith it's going to come in handy amen you're trying to start your car sometime it's not working just try it amen that's how you get it that's how you get those burly muscles amen nothing will be able to stand in your way hallelujah and we are told by the Bible that faith comes by hearing amen and not by just hearing anything but by hearing the Word of God amen and how do we hear the word when we listen to the tapes you come every Sunday every Wednesday you come listen to the word being preached from here you are hearing the word and that is faith and the Prophet talks about this in the exposition of the seven Church ages he said so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man amen why because you heard that word you took it to your heart not just mental many at times we'd like to have a you know mental belief of the word you know we are mental message believers we don't take it to the heart amen it doesn't show in our lives you know we try and study and become theologians but in the heart day is nothing but this is not what the Prophet is saying you take the word take it to your heart a man and when you put it on your lips it is the same as deity speaking the Prophet goes on to say in the in the Patmos vision he say it's now man I was going to choke it but I'm now going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did he not say in mark 1112 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you say Amen what happens when to omnipotence meet when God and men comes together to omnipotence a man he says something's gotta shake a man hails gotta shake a man all the troubles gotta shake that disease that's probably troubling you gotta shake a man that depression that's robbing you is gonna shake a man whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass Amen things that is not it makes them as though they are because to omnipotence have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful amen you know in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God amen when we take that word to our heart we are taking the person of Christ into us a man and we are having to omnipotens amen we are having a man and we are having God a man and the Prophet is telling us when this to omnipotens me oh the reaction is explosive there is no hell that can't stand a man oh this is wonderful amen he says I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it because you and I today we had to know that that we are omnipotent amen oh and we know that some time ago in the history of mankind spiros were created a man and this was not just to have a very good story in the message or to decorate the message books or to just have a wonderful story but this creation of squirrels by a human carnal human of flesh and blood like you and me it was a sign to ask the people in the end times that if a man who is fully surrendered to God and just does this what we were told and take the Word of God to his heart put it to his lips it is creative power amen we know when the Prophet was hunting and he was inspired to speak the word and creates squirrels amen we know he created squirrels but that was not just done so we glorify a man but it was for that for us so that we know in these end times we are able to do it amen we know we are little gods you just meet some people they just have a good spirit around them you know you probably had a burden you just talked to them then by the time you leave you feel good that create of the creativeness of an atmosphere a man we are gods we create amen so this was to show that we with this message that we have we can create a man and we see that this is what was linked this is where the third pole was linked to it was the speaking of the word it was to speak and to go forward amen and we know that God gave us a covenant and he said the car my covenant with you is that you speak and I will perform amen and we know that we are the people to whom the rapture was promised amen through all the seven Church ages they were kept on the faith they were just waiting on this promise but we know that this generation will not pass a man it is us who's gonna receive it a man how can you have faith for the translation of your body if you can't have faith to get healed of a to date that can't happen we are the people whom the world is got to see a paradox something that has never happened before and we're gonna have the faith amen when we are ready we know rapture is a process and we are already going through it amen when it comes to the point when we have to get our bodies translated that faith will make the spirit burst out of this body and go back to where we came from amen Oh faith it is not something you have to crank or find somewhere because if we read in arm I believe its second Peter 2nd Peter 1 verse 5 and he says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and it goes on you see of all these seven virtues that make up the stage of a perfect man you have to add everything else what are we adding it to faith it says to faith and to your faith add virtue which means the faith was already there which is this gift God has given us amen we just have to work it out amen we just have to work it out until we get into the stage of the perfect man until we get to that point where Christ can look into us and it's like he is looking into a mirror and he's looking to us a man you know just like the those people will refine gold they take gold it's got all these impurities they bit it they bit it until they see their own reflection in it this is what Christ is doing to us in this age amen he's giving us these trials but with off with all these trials he given us he gave us faith to overcome them amen our brother he just read the description that say there is no there is no temptation that's uncommon to man amen which means for each and every temptation that that that God allows to come in our way God has already provided an open way he has given us the ability to go through it so God is just waiting for us to get to that point of maturity amen when he can see himself in us he looks at us and he looks like it looks like he's looking into a mirror he sees his own reflection the mrs. mrs. Jesus Christ amen we who carry his name and by that time when we get to that perfection we will burst out of these bodies and go back to where we came from amen and it always takes supreme faith to do that amen god bless you [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh the angels and heaven in earth oh what a mighty God I will Linda into oh I will listen go to pray I will say all that the Lord who and I will return oh ye had hallelujah he has been declared who now will regard for ye and baby I will I will I will oh yes baby Oh Eddie harder he has made me glad without you you've got a round of applause man supreme faith sometimes when you're preaching and you tell people that they are gods first of all you born again that's what makes you an offspring according to the book of Acts the Bible said we are offspring of him and in the book it tells us that ye are gods to whom the word of the Lord comes - we are not elohim which means self-existing one but we're part of him we are a piece of the rock I like it because you know when you're born again if I'm born a man a man would have a child it would be a man child if God would have a child it would be a god child that right and that's why people are so afraid to see the potential that God has in us that's why the Bible said it does not yet appear what we shall be but one thing for certain we will be just like him and when you say just like him that means the same I have enjoyed the Word of God [Applause] we have been doubly blessed tonight amen and I thank God for the gifts of God that's in both of these brethren as I said when when I preached I was supposed to preach as long as I could I thought I was gonna at least get a half-hour five ten minutes I was doing y'all have no idea I'm laughing now I know everybody wag their head they said no way he could be called a preaching better stick to singing but by God's grace I knew that I had been on the street see my pulpit was not here it was out on the street and so I knew that the gift was there like our brother Sam you say you gotta work it Amen I brother Basha plays the guitar it didn't happen overnight is that right I brother leave Paul he plays the piano I wish it was like Bing Bing Bing Bing but you gotta work it the gift is in them and you got to exercise it got to get those fingers just right and after a while you won't even have to look at the keys like my brother but while you're starting out you got to look at those keys and make sure those fingers are there right and it's so true every one of us are being tested and tried that's why Paul said we're more than conquerors through Christ Jesus our Lord both of those messages just so dumped tailed I appreciate it and they didn't talk to each other God talked to them and I am blessed and have been so blessed tonight amen you may be seated for just a moment I appreciate God for being so good to us in moments [Music] I'll see God a song I'll sing out a love song to Jesus in moments like these yes sir I lift up my hands too that's just bubbling singing ah I love you [Music] Singh Oh [Music] let's take it again in moments if more men you can stand I'll sing uh you would take our offered now I'll sing out of -
