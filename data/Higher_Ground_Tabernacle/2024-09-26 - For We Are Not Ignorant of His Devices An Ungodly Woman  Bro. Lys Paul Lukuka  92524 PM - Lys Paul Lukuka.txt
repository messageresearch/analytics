me when he re when he reach his for me I was lost and with a God or his son when he reach down his hand for me when he reach down his end for me amen how many um is grateful that the Lord reached down his hand to you we were we were deep in sin and we we didn't have a way out and only God's grace provided way for us [Music] and we are grateful for it amen uh we'll just get straight to the word oh let's open our Bibles to First Peter chapter 5 verse 8 and I'm just going to continue the same uh top topic that uh I preached the first two times amen um it's called for we are not ignorant of his [Music] devices but but tonight I will take a different um angle and I will talk about the woman but before I say anything let's just read um 1 Peter 5:8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may [Music] Dev notice the Bible doesn't say um be asleep but it says be sober and be vigilant so you have to be awake because when you are sleeping you don't know who your your enemy is and you don't and you don't know what he's planning or what he he wants to do and um if you notice also it says as a roaring lion I think there's a scripture that says um a a a lion has wrote who shall fear something like that because like a roaring Lon he brings that brings fear upon the people so that's how the devil always tries to operate always with fear so let's go to the next uh uh um scripture 2 Corinthians 2: 9-1 for this end also did I write that I I might know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things to whom you forgive anything I forgive also to CH and verse 10 to whom you forgive anything I forgive also for if I forgive anything anything to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ let Satan should get an advantage for us or let Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices amen let's bow our head dear heavenly father Lord we thank you so much for your grace Lord and for your love towards us Lord Jes Lord we realize that we are nothing without you lord and we don't want to be anything without you lord we want you to be our all in all Lord and father Lord in this service we invite you Lord knowing with the full assurance that your Prophet said Lord that every time that you are invited you always show up to your appointment heavly father Lord um Heaven and Earth shall pass away but your word will never pass away and we put our faith on your word Lord Jesus therefore Lord I pray that you you speak to us Lord God tonight Lord I commit myself to you Lord and I Surrender myself to you Lord may you bless the service may you hear through the congregation Lord and may you be glorified in all things Lord Jesus because Lord I don't want to be glorified and I don't want anybody else to be glorified by you Lord because father Lord God the purpose of preaching is to get people to you Lord God but the only way to get people to you is to glorify you Lord because you said in your word father if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me Lord I Surrender the service into your hand Lord I curse every Spirit that's not confessing your name I rebuke in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats like I said this is going to be the third part of um the sermon that I preached before here I didn't plan to have a third part but um like every time I preach I never finish so that that's why I keep on adding those parts but by the grace of God I hope I'll say what needs to be said to be a blessing to you all all right so we're going to talk about the devices of the enemy previously we spoke about fear how the devil operates through fear and he also uses um he attacks the young people and we today we're going to talk about how the devil uses a woman as a weapon to attack the children of God the prophet said in this message why are people so tossed about he said and noticing them one of them was money uh women popularity and those three things I noticed in the scripture that where it money was the prophet B bam who sold out his gift account of money when BAC offered so much money many many of you are acquainted with the story and to Samson it was Thea the woman who wed him in her lap until he gave away the secrets of the Lord to her and Saul it was popularity he was a prophet so we understand that according to the prophet there are three things that the devil uses to get man of God popularity women and money do we all believe that that's we just read the prophet I like reading the prophet to show you to show you where I'm taking this from So today we're just going to focus on that one part the woman why am I focusing on that because the prophet says that if you want to see how spiritually churches look at the woman let let's read this quote um if you want to know where the church is standing watch the women watch the morals among the women because she's a representation of the church when you see the pollution among the women you find the pollution in the church if we want to know how spiritual the Church of Higher Ground is we just have to look at the woman in this church that's the word you know in this message the prophet says that um uh what she become a painted up Jezebel just exactly what the church has [Music] become if you want to know where the church is watch the morals among the women because she is the church the church is a woman you know the prophet even goes deeper and even talks about in a marriage between a man a husband and his wife you you you know how spiritual a a husband is by looking at his wife because the bride reflects the character of a man [Music] you know for instance you cannot be um um a holy ghost fi man but what attracts you is let's say for instance a wife wearing bikinis you know you may say that you are a Christian but your actions is proving that you're not a Christian the prophet says that she reflects she reflects what's in him so it's very like the woman plays a very important role in the church all right so um let's go to I don't know how I printed this but all right we'll just use it like that so uh let's go to proverb 7: 2 the Bible talks about this one this like you'll have to read the whole chapter I just took verse 25 and 26 to show you the power of an ungodly woman that's why even you as a Christian even filled with the Holy Ghost you still have to be careful with women because here in verse of 25 it says let not thy heart decline to her ways go not astray in her path for she has cast down many wounded yet many strong men have been slain by her her house is the way to Hell going down to the chambers of death you know so the Bible even talks about many strong men you no wonder the prophet say said don't don't try to see how close you can get from sin but try to see how far away you can stay from sin so this and and then if you read this chapter they're talking about a prostitute a woman of ill Fame like she she has brought down many strong men this is this is just me laying the foundation cuz I'll be talking more specifically on like um high heels high heels all right um so in the message marriage and divorce the prophet says um but in the human race it's the woman that's pretty not the man if he is there is something wrong amen paragraph 121 there there is crossed up seed somewhere originally it's that way why was it done to deceive by heard designer Satan is still working on her too in these last days so we understand that Satan was the original designer of the woman but he did not stop working on her even in these last days Satan is still working on the woman you know and and how is he working his is working through Hollywood Hollywood for instance a lot of a lot of Christians nowadays they they they or even just women in general we look at Hollywood as our example no we try to make Hollywood our standard whatever Hollywood calls Beauty that's why we we think is beauty instead of looking oursel in the filter of the word what does the word the Bible cause Beauty you know Psalm 139 says for I'm fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are are thy works you know but people are no longer satisfied with the way God made them why because it's the influence of Satan he's still working on the woman the prophet says the beauty of the Lord is in Hol Holiness and power not in paint and powder and shorts and everything else that they're trying to wear and do it sister you claim to believe the message the message is telling you that beauty is not wearing paints or powder or makeups or shorts or anything like [Music] that it's in beauty of the Holiness and righteousness and then I'm not don't think I'm trying to go at you uh the women I'm not trying to go um hard at you this is just um you know as I said like if you want to see how spiritual the church is you have to look at the women know because if someone comes in this church if someone who is very spiritual who knows this message come inside this church if you want to see how spiritual Higher Ground Tabernacle is he has he he doesn't even have to look at the pastor now brother Rich he has to look at you the women you reflect what is in the church and we we we want to we want to clean the the church out that's what a true Revival is true Revival is getting all the trash out of the of the church we we don't just want we don't want new members to come to this church while we have people in this church who don't even uh uh clean up their own lives judgment the correction begins in the house of the Lord so that's why I'm reading a lot the prophet because I don't want you to to think to to think it's me against you and then to really be specific even the prophet wasn't against the women he was against the spirit that's in them I was reading a message where the Prophet says it's a spirits that in them and they just don't they don't know it you can clearly see how the prophet is against painting or wearing like uh powder or anything like that but we but you still see women doing that sometimes I wonder I'm like do these people even listen to The Prophet at home mess you know but some they do listen but it just it's like a spirit of stubbornness yeah so and we are here to expose that Spirit to expose the devil Satan doesn't like to be exposed as I said in previous sermons in 1 Timothy Chapter 2 ver9 it says in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest appar apparel with shamefastness and sobriety not with braded hair or gold or pearls or or costly array so whatever I'm going to be saying today just um look at yourself and then where you you find yourself faulty let the word correct you the Bible the Bible says we are Washed by the Water of the word you know and even men I don't want you to think if this is just for the sisters because you as the man your wife is a reflection of you you are the head of your household and many places in the message the prophet even um when he talks about the women he actually takes it back to the man he says shame on you man for letting your wife go out like that Satan Satan has invaded the country the the the United States or the world you remember that Vision that the prophet had on the souls that are in prison he had a vision he went to hell and he saw women painted having long nails and all those things he saw that in hell and one time he went to J pen I think that was the store and he saw the same thing that he saw in Hell and he said hell is on earth now so there are two the prophet say there are only two influences that that govern the world it's either of Satan or God it's either of Hell or or or Heaven that's why Jesus taught us when we pray to say Let It Be On Earth as it is in heaven you know and and um let me just show a few um statistics here on how Satan is actually working on the woman so uh there's this thing called uh it's too small you probably won't be able to see sorry uh but it's like plastic surgery surgery and it's on the rise because and then if you notice the number two is a breast augmentation so women they want to increase their breast and then in 2022 there were 2 milon2 200 something cases of women that had breast augmentations compared to 2019 where there was 1 1,700 you know so the good thing at least is that in 2023 it kind of went down from 2022 all and why is that because we're trying to pattering after Hollywood people are no longer satisfied even we even have a uh BBL La Brazilian bat lift or something like that so women are even working on on their their their behinds to try to make themsel more attractive so this article that I found online says with the rise of social media but a augment augmentation has been tactically touted by influencers and celebrities who often refute any claims of getting work done influenc notably members of the Kardashian Clan have famously contributed to the procedures popularity with their hourglass figures musical artists like cardi b k michell have both talked about getting below board but [Music] injections and then they say the BBL became more popular in the Us in the middle of the last decade the American Society of plastic surgeon called uh to 2015 another year of the rear in its annual report the the the that that year there was a b there was a b hog procedure such as Le implants uh performed every 30 minutes lifter implant F coincident coincidently 2015 was the year after Kim Kardashian's INF famous internet breaking cover of paper magazine where she showed off the the behind that launch 1,000 think pieces cover theer magazine and you notice like if you're on social media you'll notice that those people they call them influencers and they even paid them millions of I remember I think that was this one musician called Selena Gomez they or even Kim Kardashian she'll post they'll I think she she will make a million dollars by posting just one picture why is that they are influencers but influencers of what influences from hell and then we Christians we are trying to pattern after those people you know we got to be careful we got to be care because those things carry Spirit no wonder you come to church and then you don't understand there's just a spirit of lust in the church but it's those things that you see on social media you try to pattern yourself after those models sir and when the women come to church dressed in that manner that brings a last spirits in the church am so this one article talks about this young girl she said that as a young black te in the late 90s or early 2000s Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez were the women of the hour their bodies were were perceived as the ideal posing a stark a stark contrast to the mainstream culture of flatb seen on real thin white supermodels and [Music] celebrities Brian felt like she liked an hourglass figure and wanted a natural looking BBL to feel more womanly so by looking so by looking at Beyonce any anybody know knows Beyonce here right so by looking at Beyonce or Jennifer Lopez she felt like she wanted also to look like them to have an hourglass figure and then she's not the only one you know even in this church where have people you see a picture on social media and you're like I want to be like that person but do you even filter that picture through the word to see okay you know the Bible says it's not a bad thing to copy good things but when you try to copy something that's against the word of God that's when it's bad our example should be fil anything we do should be filtered through the word of God the way we dress should be according to the word of God and it doesn't stop there right so just bear with me I know this is a lot of um stats this is probably the last one I'll read this is not but you know sat is the prophet says he's a he's a genius because those uh uh plastic surgery cost a lot of money so now if you want to increase your breast or change your butt it's it it's 10 10,000 of of dollars you know it's a lot of money but a lot of a lot of people don't have that money remember the prophet says that is still working on the woman some women here can probably know what I'm talking about if you don't that's good but there's this thing called shapewear so it's I think it's I looked it up on Amazon it's like $30 or $40 but it's an under government that helps create a smooth silhouette and cul your figure to highlight your natural [Music] curves highlight your natural curv especially when wearing tight feeding clothing you know so now he's developing these cheap things that you put inside you won't even know you know because they put it inside their cloth it's like an under on garment but it it it creates like a smoth it creates a shape you know for the woman to make her more have a shape you know have a behind and all that you know and this I mean this I learned that from my own sister she told me about that you know she said that there are so many sister that you just see them you think that they have a form but some of them now they wear those shapew wear to make them look like they have a form why because you are no longer satisfied with the way God Made You by adding all those forms it just makes you more attractive to men and and then and then men go and last after you and then that you just take them to hell and yourself to you guilty all right this is just um it was just some of the foundation uh the Prophet The Prophet said that our women has bowed to the goddess of fashion of Hollywood and the pulpit got and the pulpit got into Hollywood through singers and so forth talented man true he said how shrew how a shrewd man that devil is this is what I was looking for the part where it says she don't know right the prophet says that the woman is a nice woman I don't say she's de demoralized but the thing of it is there's an ordinary filthy spirits on her making her do that and she don't know it when every time you try to make yourself wear those tight feding clothes and those high heels and all those things it's a spirit on you and I can tell you that spirit is not of God and you know that Spirit even can have an impact on the service if you didn't know that I'm going jump to my last quote that I had here but I think this is fitting to what I'm saying here so the prophet said um and I was I was uh sitting at a convention now long ago and he broke me down almost when everybody seemed to be just enjoying a minist [Music] talk that was standing on the platform just like a situation right now like a minister uh speaking and enjoy you enjoying the word of God and I was sitting there in a corner and a young lady come in and she was really dressed bad and she come walking up through this church as the Bible says mincing as they went as she went so let's give it in our scenario like we're preaching and then the sister comes in and she's dressed immorally like with very bad dress and um meing means more like twisting you know like um um wearing high heels she walks a certain way that makes her body shakes a certain way and the prophet said and every preacher on the platform plus the congregation [Music] everyone turning their head and looking following this girl and and uh and I thought of the scripture the sons of God looked upon the daughters of men Sinners ungodly pray women toring many a church to Pieces it's tearing this Higher Ground to Pieces it took the spirit of God away you know so there was a service going on in a minister was preaching and a woman came in dressed really bad and everybody looked at that woman that took the spirit of God away and then we wonder why we don't see the power of God in the church the way you are you dress can can grieve the holy spirit of God a way from the church remember what I said earlier everything I'll be reading let's apply that to Higher Ground Tabernacle okay now let's go to I'll talk about the high heals um no before I go there let me read this one quot um the prophet says um um but okay let's see the woman is a nice woman I don't say she is demoralized the thing of there in honorary filthy spirits on her making her do that and she don't know it but you are pretty but if you if you haven't got the Holy Spirit there to protect those morals you would have been better to be so ugly nobody would have looked at you and went to heaven so sisters God G you that beauty but if you don't uh uh if you don't have the Holy Ghost you can use that beauty to send a lot of men to hell and that and that same Beauty and that same Beauty can take you to hell too the prophet said it would even be better to be so ugly than being a beautiful woman who don't have the Holy Ghost amen right so that's why it's important to have the Holy Ghost you know we can never emphasize on the important the Holy Ghost is what we need to to walk in this journey I think there is a quote where the Prophet says that a man without the Holy Ghost is like a brute Beast don't have no morals no amen and then you know here the prophet says the same thing the girls and them young ladies they pattern after Hollywood sister this morning if you if you were patterning after Hollywood you you should you better stop doing that all right um let me skip this so the prophet says that the invasion is [Music] on and it's sweeping from house to house from place to place from church to church from Men to Men you just look at another church you see all the scandals that are happening in the chur in those churches don't think it's going to stop there it's sweeping it's sweeping from church to church from the church in the corner to Higher Ground you know but if you don't know remember this the scripture that we read earlier if you don't know the devil's uh device is he has an advantage over you that's why we have to expose him all right let's talk about how he heals now let's go to the book of Isaiah 3 verse 16 okay the Bible says moreover the Lord saith because the daughters of Zion are Hardy and walk with stretch forth necks and want eyes walking and mincing as they go and making and tinkling with their [Music] feet so you may say that um okay brother Le here the Bible doesn't talk about high heels he doesn't even use the word high heels but you have to understand that prophets in the bi in the Bible they they use the the word that were available in in their [Music] time for instance uh in the book of n 2 verse4 a it's a prophecy um regarding cars that we have in our days but it did not use the word cars but when you read it the Chariots shall rage in the streets they shall just jle one against another in the Broadways they shall seem like torches uh they shall run like the lightings you know so the um the word jle in the Miriam Webster it defines it as to come in contact or into Collision so this prophet he saw because you know prophets they have been they they see way way far like they they have Eagle they're Eagles he he saw that these chariots had they had torches so those those those lights in the cars and they were driving in Broadways you know so they don't always have to use that word but you can understand the meaning so let's go back to Isaiah 3:16 and let's study this scripture so the daughters of Zion are how howdy the definition of howy is um hold on I think I have it here it's blatantly or disdain disdainfully proud having or showing an attitude of superiority or contempt for people or things perceived to be inferior so this prophet he saw these women were PR PR prideful you you can't tell them what to do they know it all you know and then let's go back to the scripture again he says they walk with stretch forth necks and want to eyes walking and meaning as the go so the strong biblical cyclopedia says that the word mincing occurs in the prophets description of the behavior of the daughters of Jerusalem and then he says the P the passage might be rendered the world and trip along although the Hebrew word has perhaps a slightly different sense yet the Gate of the females seems to have been very much like the modern practice of swaying the body in walking so whoever these women that the prophet Isaiah saw they were wearing things that were making them it was changing the way they walk you know by the the way they were walking it was they were meaning swaying their [Music] body and the prophet says here a woman that's beautiful that beauty will fade just as sure do you just give it a few years maybe today she's twisting down the street some little half dressed woman sending more souls to Hell than any baronss in the country but she'll twist herself down the streets thinking she's something as the Bible says they'll have stretched out necks and even even the prophet says and want on mincing that means twisting so the the prophet also agrees with that definition twisting as they go in the last day fulfilling the scriptures and doesn't know it they stand in the yard with immoral immoral clothes on men looking at her and don't know she may be as virtuous to her husband or boyfriend as she can be but at the day of judgment she'll answer for committing adultery with hundreds of men a spirit on them and they don't know it all right so this next quotes the prophet talks about a dream that he had I brother Brook say right that here before too it's in the message the rising of the sun it's a lengthy quote but I'll I'll take it slowly and explain some other things willing my own mother she's gone on now paragraph 232 she was a very odd woman and she was you know about a half Indian and and she was odd she only had four or five dreams all of all of her life but every time she dreamed they dreamed it was true I remember one time when I first started preaching many years ago we was living up right um right here on the road and she dreamed a dream that I was standing here by the side of three steps and I was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk walk up these three steps before they hit the highway let's really take this um let's like pay attention and listen closely so the prophet in that dream the prophet was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the [Music] highway and on the highway is a little pearly like white line it run right into the doors of Heaven to the Pearly Gat and and that Pearl had been stretched out to the top of these steps so it's for instance let's say heaven is where de is standing like there's a a big Highway taking to de brother and then from from in the highway there's a straight line from the door of Heaven to where I'm standing but before getting to the highway there are three steps right so we are we following all right so the prophet said there was a lady that came by you know what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago there was a lady come by had on Great Big pair like they were today Spike healed shoes so she was wearing Spike healed shoes and she come by and I said wait a minute sister notice he called her sister she was a sister this was this wasn't no stranger this wasn't no can you can you turn that [Music] off yeah thank you so this wasn't um it wasn't no stranger it was a sister and the prophet told her you can't walk the highway with that and I said you can't do that you know so the prophet gave her a warning that with those high heel shoes she couldn't walk the highway with those the highway that has you know the Bible says there's a highway and in the highway there is a way that takes you to heaven right just like in this dream there's a highway and there's a pearly line that takes you to to heaven and she said ah she said looked around at the rest of the women said don't believe him he's a mad man remember like I said earlier every I'm reading apply that to yourself so sisters that have high heels in your homes you know I think I was reading the message the identification the prophet said that uh you have to Iden identify yourself with the word that like um whatever position you have today that's a position you would have taken in the time of Noah for instance with so your response towards the the word the prophet's message is the same response you would have given him back then if he told you the same thing I don't know who has high heels in in their homes or right now or even live streaming but apply yourself in this message identify yourself in this message so the prophet is telling you you can't walk the highway with that but remember that that woman with those High the high heel shoes the Bible calls her hardy hardy which means prideful when someone is prideful you can't really tell him what to do they claim to know it all the prophet is telling her that she cannot walk she's oh don't listen to that man he's a mad man show you I can be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and still walk that I know better than the prophet that's that's in other words that's what she was saying your pastor is telling you something constantly going rebuking the high heels the tight dress but you you think you know better than [Music] him you forget that God put him to as a Shepherd he sees things that you guys don't see I'll will show you I can still go to heaven because I believe the message I don't think M wearing high heel to church will take me to hell no it all Happ and the prophet said I just let her go the word of God will always warn you but then he gives you the freedom to choose what to do God is not going to constantly always comes reminding you that what you're doing is bad there will be a one day that will be the last time he will just let you go just like the prophet let this woman go so if sisters in this church you don't want to listen to when every time brother Brooks is talking about high heels he'll just let you go you know and but but then by the result you will you will know uh uh that he was right all right so continue couldn't do more about it couldn't stop her you know and she jumped on the on the highway she looked back at the sister said see I told you she jumped on the highway she started speaking in tongues she started you know she's seeing the blessings of God in her life and she's like see you know he has nothing to do with her he and then she started to run up remember the Bible says run this race so she also started running that race but remember okay let's just keep reading you know as the Bible said in Isaiah 5th chapter that they would have outstretched necks the prophet said they have to because they're pitched over for me you know and um I'll just keep a few I want to show you an image how what what does the prophet mean by they're pitched over right prove it with um high heels okay so I have this here so um on the left Sid on the left side it shows a woman wearing flight flight shoes on on the right side he says a woman wearing high heels you can clearly see the difference you know and um before I go there if this is another example too no she's pitched over because the way the woman the so the way when I'm standing like this this is I'm standing 90 Dees from the floor and when I put on high heels I'm supposed to go it depends on the the level of heels but you're supposed to like because of the law of gravity you have to fall because gravity is pulling down on you those are just the laws of God you can't there's nothing to do about it so that's why now she has to be pitched over she has to be changed in order for her not to fall and that change is making if you notice in these pictures um it's making the breast come out and the butt is going out right remember Satan is still working on her he's trying to make her more attractive you see for instance in this even in this picture you can see that you know like the breast is coming out and the behind is going out That's what Satan is doing with with the women today why he's trying to make her more attractive we just we just read in the Plastic Surgery like number two was the breast augmentation and then even you women I don't know I'm not a woman so I can't really speak on that but I'm I'm sure you can feel a difference when you're wearing high heels versus flat shoes I think I was reading somewhere someone even says it gives you that confidence when you walk that Pride that's what Isaiah was Isaiah saw this thousands years ago and the prophet says pitched over they have to let's continue reading that quote meing they have to have they have to twist imagine the way she's already designed like um you know we saw the pictures and then now you twisting your body moving all all the parts of your body and then uh the Bible says making a tinkling with their their heels scripture in Isaiah says making a tinkling with their feet right those high heels when you walk when let's let when you go to when you go into a quiet room and a woman walks with high heels you just hear go you know that's why the Bible talks about making a noise with a tinkling uh with their their feet the daughters of Zion in the last [Music] day you know she started up the highway just as hard as she could so she was also running the race but I think she was running the wrong race because because she she she could not she did not run the race with the instructions because how can you run a race when you don't even know the instructions of of the race for instance in the in the relay you got to have a a stick you know and you got to give it to the next person but imagine if you don't know the instruction you just running with the Baton and you get to that the person you don't hand him the the Baton or or or for instance you're not supposed to to go to your to to the other um the other person's Lanes there are things that can get you disqualified she did not take the in instructions you know the prophet is a is a mouth of God no so and then and after a while the road got narrower and narrower you know the Bible talks about narrow is the is the the way right the way I was supposed to read that but I think I skipped that but but so that that Highway became narrower you know and after a while the road got near and near and then she started reeling mining like that and off she went and mother said the horrible the the horribl screams that I ever heard in my life was that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down down like so those high heels took that woman to hell you know she the prophet say she listened to everything but one word Justified Sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost but she left one word some of the things that you think has the the least significance you have to apply the full word of God if high heels took her to hell don't think you'll take you to heaven so the Prophet The Prophet is telling you that that you cannot walk that way wearing high heels so now it's up to you to to to see what you want to do do you want to end up in hell because you think you know better than the prophet or do you want to humble yourself and throw that out of the way no I I wish more people were here today to hear this but but this this also shows the spirits that's in you because when the word of God tells you to do one thing and then you refuse to do it it shows what kind of spirit you have in you because the Holy Ghost is obedient to the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost in you is the word in you and he has to be obedient to the word if you don't if you don't listen that that shows what kind of spirit you have in you and you probably didn't know what kind of spirit you had but then the word just exposed that it's the spirit of the devil you know the prophet says she just obeyed everything everything but one word no see everything but one word all right all right let's um I'll qu end with this um so remember how it said that we have we have to um the Bible says that let your will be on Earth as it is in heaven we just read here the daughters of Zion and then uh they were twisting you know as they were going and then let's read in another place where the Prophet also saw other kinds of daughters of Zs that were twisting over there that was Isaiah but now William Bram also had a vision that was the vision of the Bride the preview of the Bride the prophet said I was to have a preview of the church and I was taken by someone who I could not see and was set set up on like a stand and I heard the sweetest music I ever heard and I looked coming and a bunch of little ladies about um you want to read you know they they all had long hair and was fixed in different dresses type dresses and they were marching [Music] just as perfectly in step with that music as it could be and they went from my left going around this way and I watched them and I looked then to see who was talking to me and I couldn't see no one then I heard a rock and roll band coming and roll and when I looked over to my right side coming up this way coming back here come the churches of the world each one carrying their Banner from where they were from some of the dirtiest looking things I've I ever seen in my life and when the American Church come up it was the awfulest I ever seen the heavenly father is my judge they had on these tail tail TL tail gray skirts like one of these Baron girls with no back on it holding up like a gray looking piece of paper like hoola dancing and I'm going to stop here you know I've never really seen this quote like that till just when I was studying this and I I I went to do research on what is hola dancing like you know because this is the vision of the of the the the the church you know the church that was impure you know that the other daughters of Zion and and later on you'll see also talks about were twisting as well so I I will show you uh this really brought something to my attention some of you may disagree but hey take it however you want want to take it that I just that's the word you know I can't help it but hopefully that that can help you so Peter if uh can you play the go to Google and play that first video that I have on YouTube and put um so that the people can see don't play yet put it so that the people can see on the screen here John if you can go help them no but you can't see it yet you got to I want to see it here first hey John slide it to the right yeah slideing and then make it bigger I don't play yet so um make sure it's also showing on the live stream for the people to see that there all right so just this so this is the hoola dancing that the prophet was referring in that Vision bride that he saw that's the kind of dance that we're dancing so play just no sound just play the video without the sound right so so the American people may not know this some may but you can pause it now um but for the I'll just ask a simple question for the congales people what does this dance um remind you of what kind of dance does it remind you of can one person answer I see you guys laughing just answer M right now now the play the next video U make it smaller on the right there's another video so this is the hoola dancing that the prophet saw that dirty bride dancing and I played the other video that's on the right of it make it bigger video it played so I have a question to ask you can pause it now I have a question to ask you so this is what the KES people call M and the other one was H dancing which one looks worse to you or it's it's it's going to be the same or this looks worse you know it's it's interesting interesting because I did not even mention the name of the dance you already recognize the dance from Thea dance you were like this you see those are spirits from Hell influencing the church and you are not a the Satan said the the prophet says they don't know it but we are here to expose Satan right you may say that this is an African dance but the prophet saw because hoola is a Hawaiian Hawaiian dance and the prophet saw that dirty bride dancing to the Beats of rock and roll with hoola dancing we have church people using culture to dance that kind of dance no represents the Bride of Satan and you really want to use that dance that Satan was that the Bride of Satan was dancing to us that's how you enjoy it shows what kind of spirit is in you no because when you enjoy what Satan enjoys the Bible says that Satan cannot be against Satan because his kingdom is going to be divided this is not about culture this is the word brother wasn't American but he talked about he talked about a Hawaiian uh dance so that has nothing to do with culture it's the way you dance when you you twist your body that way that's an evil spirits on you and you don't know it and then the bad thing is even by doing that you are also sending other spirits to other people you know Spirit communicate with each other you know that's why sometime you see some people you like I Just Vibe better with this person because your spirits are communicating they they they get along better and then you go to parties hey dancing M worship but you don't know that Satan is using you to send more people to hell so I'll continue this qu to paint short bobbed hair smoking [Music] cigarettes paint I don't understand when I was reading this I was like I wonder really if people listen to the prophet problem we had especially with the youth people don't listen to The Prophet at [Music] home you've made this message become like a Catholic system where you just come to church the ministers read to you the word you go home and that's it or when you listen to the prophet he just on your way to work in the car but you don't really have the time to set to set aside and literally listen to the message no it's a Spirit of St if if you actually if you listen to the prophet you see this but you're not applying this it's a spirit of stubbornness that's on you you need you need to be delivered from it know and I stood I stood there looking she passed on by and you can't imagine the back of her the back of her with nothing on holding this you know the back of her nothing on sometimes you come to church you wear a dress that showing your like your your entire back is exposed that's not modesty you know this is the house of God is the house of correction this is not against you but you reflect what is in the church so um um and it was oh yeah okay let's see and you can imagine the back of her with nothing on holding this in front of her as she went shaming by by like that to to this twist throwing her her limbs out like that you know so we saw the daughters of Zion were twisting and we see this bride the Bride of Satan is also twisting our body how she was caring on her body shaking around like that many times I've heard brother boo talk talk about how sisters or even Brothers how we when they dance in weddings shaking their their body a certain way it's an evil spirit know it is an evil spirit and we just exposed that and you have to repent in order to repent first you have to humble yourself you have to acknowledge that I was wrong Lord forgive me I didn't know this was bad like that and if I don't see it if I I still don't see it but I I was working on another message uh on like a hard surgery where the where the Prophet says that oh sorry you go ahead he said that many people can can't live a Christian life because they still have that Heart of Stone in them live a Christian Life and the Heart of Stone cannot accept the things of God your own Spirit cannot work with the spirit of God that's why the Bible says I will I will give you a new heart I will give you a new spirit and then I will put my spirit in you that's why you can't you keep reading the the the the message and you hear Brother book preaching the pulpits but no moves you you still come to church with those high heels tight wearing dress and all that you need a heart surgery you need God to operate your heart and to remove that stubbornness from you God hates a prideful Spirit you know I'm going to close here we we're already done it's 9:04 we just heard and then and then the thing is I brought this in the message or the Bible if anybody disagrees with anything I said just come see me and talk about that brother Brooks or any other the ministers remember in the beginning I said everything I say apply that to yourself so now examine your lives examine your homes examine the way you dress you know because you have a powerful Ministry sisters it's God didn't choose a man to represent his bride he chose you so it's a very it's like it's like the president of a country trust you to represent him in another in another place that's the highest level of trust so don't abuse it show to the world that you are the daughters of God don't pattern after Hollywood it doesn't matter what other people do you know but I want you to come with this resolution that me and my house we shall serve the Lord I think it says choose you this day wh whom you may serve this Wednesday evening after this uh preaching on on the women the dress the high heels and they seeing this example of two we just read earlier there were there was the true bride and then the the the the Bride of Satan those two are influencing whatever is happening in this world now choose ye this day whom you want to be influenced by the Bride of Satan keep on wearing high heels dancing M well and then like wearing tight dress we I see so many sisters sometimes coming to church with like tight dress it makes it so uncomfortable for us Brothers in the back there to even do our our job and what is that it's Satan that's anointing you to to to make to make our life miserable you know we just read the prophet says it takes the spirit of God away from the church do you so what's your point of I don't want to go to a service where God is not there so why would you come to church knowing that the way you are dressed is going to take the spirit of God away then you make the church become like a lodge it becomes just ather the Bible says that when the enemy Rises as a flood the spirit of the Lord will rise a standard against it [Music] stand against the the the tactics of the enemy you know choose you this day when you may serve amen amen God bless you um let's just sing that song when you he reach down on his hand for me again we uh you can stand can you leave yeah goe once my soul was astray from the heaven the way I was red and V could be then myor above gave me peace joy and love when he reached down his end for me oh when he re when he reached down his end for me when he reach down his end for

lost and I'm done without God and son when you reach down his hand for me while the while the music plays you U you can bow your head the word of this song says that I was lost without God or his son the Bible says that at the beginning was the word the word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us the word came tonight and corrected us all and are we will willing to repent like right right where you are in your in your in your in your seat the true altar is in Your Heart Lord the word was spoken and examine yourself exam you know were you also lost and headed towards the wrong way like that like that woman that was walking the highway with those high heels she heard the word but she thought she knew better thought she knew more than the pastor thought she knew more than the prophet but she ended up in hell don't think that you are any different than that woman the prophet called her sister she was a sister you know it may it may be her heels he may be tight dress or anything like that just speak to God and tell God to forgive you and tell and promise him that you from this day that you're going to your homes and clearing all that trust out of your life you know in order for God to work with you you have to humble yourself first you know then then when you you remove all that trust out of your house then God is going to be welcome in your home God is is going to provide solutions to your problems but you first have to apply the word to your is there anybody that that that wants to to to um make make his life right and and listen to the word of God from this day on and just raise your hand and we'll pray and if you have a stubborn heart also just raise your hand God is a is the greatest surgeon that we've ever head of this world they can remove the human heart
