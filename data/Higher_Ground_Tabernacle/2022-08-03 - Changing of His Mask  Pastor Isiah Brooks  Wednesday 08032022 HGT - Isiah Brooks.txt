uh thermometer it was 105. that's kind of hot thank god for us great amen god is good to us we had a wonderful time some soul saved and deliverances we had one baptism and it was really really ex outstanding the services were and um it just like it was a building block and i think you can look at them on on youtube it's a bright tabernacle if you wanted to look at the services by god's grace as we stand let us turn to luke the 12th chapter we'll read the 32nd and the 34th verse luke the 12th chapter i if i had been if i was a machine i would never get tired but because i'm not a machine i get tired like everybody else how about that that's just the way it is luke 12 32-34 are you there fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom sell that you have give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief approaches neither moth corrupt for where your treasure is there will your heart be also one more scripture revelations 21 revelations 21 21-11 everybody there having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal let's read the tenth verse i'm sorry and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god let us pray our gracious father we come before you lord as humble as we know howard we thank you for this time and opportunity lord to worship you and in your word we realize oh god that without you we are nothing and we realize oh god that you are our everything we thank you father for being so real to us for being our heartbeat our life our breath and lord god we pray this evening that your perfect will will be done as we surrender ourselves our souls our minds our body to you have thine own way lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i have been uh just thinking about a lot of things the meetings as i said in south carolina were really really great they were really good and you know when we say that word good it almost feels like i'm cheating it's beyond good but we know one thing for certain for those who heard the word of god if they really listened no no doubt they was in for a change some came up for the holy baptism of the holy ghost and as far as i know it appears that they did get it it was really really phenomenal how the word of the lord did what god did what he did there was a lot of dancing a lot of worship a lot of praising and there was a lot of weeping i like to entitle this message because well i guess my thought of the bride and i'm going to try to take my time like i'm doing now um if he permits the changing of his mask and in our day and when we think about that we must come to know to know your position in christ is a revelation and only god can give that to you so i trust by god's grace that god is working with you to vindicate himself in you uh because you got to understand the bride in this day has to have more than words she is a powerhouse she must be one that god vindicates you know resolve all doubts that she is bride she will be different from all the rest because not only will she have the authority of god but she will also have his life i took a quote from arenas you know we remember him from the church age book and uranus says the glory of god is a man fully alive but the life of a man is the vision of god human action takes on an even greater significance when we can consider this statement for if god's glory is a man fully alive then man's life must be a noble thing and when we see and say these things because we have lived as human beings and and basically what we look at as being man it's not really man it's just it's just a perversion of him because only god can give you what a real man is jesus christ was the first real man at the adam his life was perfect he loved god in every way he was the word made manifest and he never did one thing wrong amen as a man i'm speaking because as god we know the bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily jesus wasn't 99.9 faith he was a hundred percent now the bible tells us not to fear because we're living in the most evilest age ever we've never seen things the way they are never have been because what you've got now you've got seven church ages uh kind of that's that's kind of moved in together so so all of the wickedness in every age is now coming to a head in this day and age and the people who lived in ephesus would have never made it in this age and all of the other ages god hand picked you for this age because he knew you could do it he understood your makeup now think about if you got 6 000 going on years of sinful acts in your dna not just sin for acts plagues and viruses and all of those things that have attached themselves to and god says you can make it i believe with all my heart that god has already equipped us you see that's what the prophet said that god equips you he doesn't just put you out there with with empty hands but he equips you every man every woman for their age god equips them so they can be victorious in their age one of the things that i i i know that we must do here the bible says that we've got to basically give everything away sell everything and that means things of value to you things that you treasure things that you know you you would idolize god said you got to surrender all those kinds of things and he says but listen there are other things that you can consider to have and these things are heavenly things wherever your wherever your heart is there is your treasure the things of earth can be taken from you stolen from you whatever they're not eternal they're just temporal but here jesus is saying i'm giving you something that's not only everlasting but eternal and you and i must understand that what we are doing now we're making choices as i've said i believe here you know it's working with the mind if satan can change your mind he can change your character is that right and it's vice versa if god changes your mind he changes your character because that's what satan did to eve in the beginning he changed her mind about the word and when he changed his mind her mind when she changed her mind about the word he changed her character with it and when i say character i'm talking about nature if the word the word we know is the only thing that could change the human nature it is the only thing that has the power to change you from a sinner to a saint it is the only thing that can take a filthy unclean dirty worm like us and make us a prince or a king or you know it has the power to transform you when we the dangers i said before here the danger of allowing our faith to become systematic is is that when your faith becomes systematic or your religion becomes systematic you you become blind you you know it's like jesus said you have left your first love and when you begin to argue and fuss about doctrine or issues and things of that nature then you have allowed the devil to be with you and you and i must understand that the word of god is not to be striving us with it it's to be taken just as it is and god will reveal to you what he means i think in our in in this time i find that there's only a few people that's really are searching and seeking and thirsting for god uh you know many of the message believers as we call them has become so complacent they're so satisfied with just being identified with malachi 4 and being able to say uh you know revelation 10 you know one through seven the mighty angel came down or saint luke you know you know the son of man but but see what we fail to see is that there is a message within a message you can read the message you can listen to the message but there's a secret within it and god reveals to you things who if your bride god will unlock those mysteries to you but if you're not he hides himself and this is why we've seen so many fallen brothers and sisters because when they thought they knew the message they never did get it and of course you'll never be able to understand what he's saying without the holy ghost coming from the message elijah the prophet brother adam tells us about paul and how that anointing was with paul that's 173rd paragraph if you want to look it up sometime but i just wanted to pull a little phrase out of it because he says like the spirit from elijah to elisha there was a carrying on of the holy spirit did y'all know that the spirit of elijah was the holy ghost how many men y'all thought elijah had his own spirit we don't get the spirit of a man we get the spirit of god and the spirit on elijah and elisha was christ the holy spirit right i think sometimes people think when they get eli as elisha you get a double portion of elijah's spirit and they thinking it's a man no no no no it's the holy ghost is that right giving you a double portion of his spirit and so we must understand when you get a a double portion of the holy spirit that means anybody know from one of the things that always excited me about real eggs is that sometimes you'll get a double yolk every time i see a double yolk i get excited don't ask me why it just makes me know that this this egg is more real than the other ones but when it comes to elijah the holy spirit comes down to give you a position now understand this elijah and elisha brother who talks about it you know and and he goes on to say now elisha was in training elijah and while all of the other prophets were doing their thing elisha stayed true to elijah elijah elisha could not get his position you see what i'm saying let me say it like this he could not get his position or come to recognize his position until elijah moved out of the way and the position that he liked shah received was appreciation that he like john once was in you see what i'm saying so that's why he said if you see me go away then the anointing the double portion will come down upon you right now if you understand this message before 1963 brother branham was preaching to everybody but when god opened the word when the seals were broken when the mighty angel came down when when when we talked about the pillar cloud and the pillar of fire his ministry was changing matter of fact he said things after the sears were open that he never said before and most of the things that he was saying was to the bride it was no longer to the public it was in a secret place that god had hidden his message in a secret place and therefore amen it only the bride of jesus christ will be able to look into the message in a spiritual way and read between the lines and understand who he's talking about he's not talking about elijah anymore he's talking about elisha and he's giving those that word of faith so elisha can put on the mantle right it just didn't happen elisha had to grow into it [Laughter] amen it just couldn't happen so god understood that this whole process of the rapture and becoming like god amen in the sense of character and nature was a process it didn't happen overnight and no matter how those people in when when the prophet left off the scene everybody said oh we got it we got it we got it but they failed to see it was just in seed form amen they didn't have it potentially they did but the reality of what we're looking at has not yet been displayed amen amen that's the truth and you and i must understand amen that this this spirit is eternal right and because you are baptized and you have the holy ghost it makes you eternal but you've got to learn and step into your position right and you must be worthy of it you know romans 4 20-25 says and talking about abraham he staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief we know sarah laughed she couldn't believe that she could produce a a child and understand everything that was done was supernatural god changed abraham and sarah back to young people they had kid children you know that's the truth because after sarah died uh abraham married another and had more children oh man come on so you and i must understand the process was was supernatural but there was also spiritual changes i mean excuse me natural changing all along god was changing the atoms in abraham's and sarah's body because they believed the promise right now we don't see it but what god is doing is changing the more you eat the more you eat the more he's changing you on the inside even though the world can't see it hallelujah the mystery still is in you hallelujah so what's happening that's why you can't lay away from the tapes you can't lay away from the books you can't lay away from your bible they all come together he's the alpha any omega hallelujah glory to god he was fully persuaded are y'all understanding this he was full abraham was fully persuaded that he that promised it was able to do it hallelujah and because he was fully see if listen you can't look at your conditions your natural faults and failures you were born of failure you came into this world failure hallelujah but god chose you to take a position that you never thought you would take what about odessa she never in her mind dreamed that one day she would be queen she was a no-name sister nobody knew her but god election did and god set the stage for her at such a time as this you see what i'm saying amen and here she was one day looking like a pauper and the next day she's in as a queen there was nothing she did do it was all god because as she was odessa god was changing her character hello and by the time she got it to to her pageant if i'd say it like that she was everything that the king a hesserua wanted who did that god hallelujah you see what i'm saying but what happened is after she came into her position it was beautiful wonderful but it wasn't all over god had to institute pressure you see what i'm saying god had to make her realize who she was you see what i'm saying see that's what was hidden in the book esther and when brother branham preached it he's trying to get god is trying to get us to see who we are and he's also telling us when the pressure come that's when we will awaken to our full position our full authority of who we are is already given to us we don't have to worry whether the king is going to give it to us esther has already written it she's already told us the king is going to give us half of the kingdom and listen jesus christ when he comes into you that's what he says i'm giving you half of the kingdom your joint airs with me everything i own you own everything i have you have right hallelujah see but it was not written for his sake alone god imputed to him righteousness the bible also said blessed is the man whom god will not impute sin the brother of them said that's the bride y'all understand me that god doesn't charge sin to you he's not concerned about your faults he's concerned about your mission what he's ordained you to do is what he is concerned about amen is that right well look how peter denied him three times you think that would upset god like how can i trust this guy with the keys no he was ordained he had a covenant that was unconditional and god took that unconditional covenant and used it to put it as a spokesman the preacher on the day of pentecost the same man who cursed and swore he didn't know jesus was the same man testifying i know him this is that when they ask what is all his commotion he said this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel in the last days i pour out my spirit this was peter the coward that ran stood boldly on the anointing of the holy ghost why why why because the god he once walked with no longer walked with him but walked in him that's what we want we want god to walk in us hallelujah oh glory to god is that right but for all of us to whom it shall not be imputed if we believe on him that means righteousness if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was once delivered what for our offenses and was raised again for our justification that's your bible hallelujah that he became sin that we might become the righteousness of god amen now when you believe that something happens hallelujah amen see jesus christ is the only he is the great shepherd i want to say this because the lord knows the path that he leads you you think god is confused he is not when you go through your suffering when you go through your trials when you go through your temptations when you go through your falls do you think god grabs his mouth said oh no i didn't know it was gonna happen no he knew it you may not like this but he ordained it god orders the steps of the righteous hallelujah he orders the steps of the righteous because i'm going to tell you something it ain't god that's being put to the test it's you right when peter then was on the boat in a storm cape and they got all afraid and began to scream and holler you know oh god cares doubt not that we perish that that test was not for them for him jesus the test was for the disciples he told them things to do and they failed they had they had power over sickness power over everything they were sons and daughters of god had not even gone to pentecost yet hallelujah but god had given them that authority and he put them to the test and they failed and that's exactly what happens to us sometimes god put us to the test and we fail we look where are you jesus and the lord is saying well i never left you but this is your battle amen you speak the word come on somebody you speak it if you really believe god is in you you speak the word amen oh you say well brother i don't feel the anointing what you mean you don't feel it if jesus christ is in you you don't have to feel it right i got a liver and i got a kidney and i don't feel it but it's in there and i know if something goes wrong it's going to let me know it's in there you see what i'm saying feel this is not this this is faith amen it might sound crazy but i'm gonna tell you it's just like when i was down there at the at the in the meeting i lost my little key i had a little key you know they give you rental and i lost it i didn't know where it was i looked at my bible to zip apart i had another brother look in it he didn't see it either that third time i zipped i said oh lord you know where the key is i zipped it and it dropped out like almost in my hand somebody said well yeah we all forget sometimes it wasn't no forgetful this to me that was supernatural you're not taking away my blessing no you can reason those things all you want to we we did the whole yard everywhere i went we flashed it we had cars moving we had our phones like we're hunting treasure hunting and we were but when god listen i don't know what kind of accident he was protecting me from god doesn't do things in vain amen i trust him mm-hmm he is our shepherd the lord jesus christ right amen that is what the holy spirit he said well how the lord gonna if you have the holy spirit he's going to lead you the bible said he will lead you and guide you into all truth what you're afraid about you don't have to be afraid he promised to lead at you and guide you into all truth the thing about it is we as sheep sometimes try to get ahead of the shepherd and you know that's abnormal man and woman god promised in this last days that he'll pour out his spirit upon all flesh he promised he has sinned the baptism of the holy ghost and he called up and he'll call a bride without spot or wrinkle he promised to do it he'll do it don't listen to these harlem shepherds they'll lead you astray the holy spirit is the shepherd to feed you sheep food from this word is always come by the shepherd he is our shepherd he said listen to him you are the sheep of his foe if you are you'll hear his voice not what somebody else say and let me say it like this when he said somebody else said we always look at somebody else like some other person why do you listen to the devil he's somebody else don't even listen to what somebody else says including the devil you know it's amazing because i had somebody compliment me today and i'm like i don't know what you seeing but you know why why do we do that why do we do that we almost spoil the compliment when people give it to you you know in reality i'm glad the compliment came but but the whole point is it's like this we do it to ourselves god said you're holy god said you're sanctified and you know what we'll say i'm a hypocrite god said i've justified you as though you've never sinned in the first place and we'll just throw out that whole list of sins we've done did yesterday today and then we'll go back in history under the blood pull it out god ain't pleased with that if he has taken you and given you his righteousness walk like you got it believe that you have it because his righteousness is your coat that he's given to you not what somebody else said you hear what he says a stranger's voice you you know not to follow right we don't do it right let's go to malachi 3. you love the lord you know a lot of people don't understand the importance and i i mean i i thank god i hate preaching even on tithing but here it is a little bit because people don't understand the the depths of that and how when you don't pay tithing god's shepherd you've broken your fellowship with him god don't fellowship with thieves and don't do it and you feel like something's missing yeah god's tithing you forgot somehow to put it in where it should be right what people don't understand well i don't have to give them you you need a revelation you understand you need a revelation god has given you life health and strength all these things he given to you and you can't give him tim you know you sound like nabal you know what we need to understand you want god to bless you and the whole time he's trying to bless you you stealing from yourself it affects everybody is that right even when a can took the little wedges and comments guess what people got his whole family was destroyed i think was 3 000 got killed or 300 i forgot how many was but it was a lot of people got killed because one man in his selfish ways we our body right you wouldn't want somebody to take a ham and hit your finger because you are told i guarantee you let somebody take a hammer and hit your finger your toe gonna feel it everything else going to feel it right malachi 3 6 and 8 for i am the lord i change not let me tell you something y'all think y'all gonna make a rapture and don't know how to play tithing you are deceived how are you going to trust god to take you in the rapture and you can't trust god to supply your knees i am the lord i change not therefore you sons of jacob are not consumed did you hear what i'm saying you sons of jacob you know jacob was a sister but jacob was born again it was changed to israel right even from the days of your fathers you have gone away from my ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will return unto you listen what he says is a problem said the lord of hosts but you say wherein shall we return well a man robbed god yet have you robbed me but you say within you have rob you you we with you you say with wherein have we robbed thee and he says in tithes and offerings and some people have paid their tithes and won't pay their offering you still a thief hallelujah people don't understand that by every word god expects us to live by every word man does not live by bread alone yeah but by every word i think i i i hope brother rich don't mind me saying this but i remember him telling me he said isn't it unfair it's like a man hiring somebody to run his company and he says all you got to do is run my company and and and when it's time to you know to pay me you give me 10 percent and you keep the 90. that's what he does tithing is 10 you keep the 90. can you imagine you have no idea the many of people who wish they could work and you know how that is i remember a brother telling me a pastor telling me that there was a brother in his church who was barely making it one time and his pain is tithing so faithfully then when he got wealthy he slacked off and he came to prayer to ask the pastor to pray for him and so the pastor said lord take his money away so he can pay pay stop paying the stock [Laughter] yeah that's the way it is well when i got rich it's hard for me to pay your tither real lord take it away so he can get back what was most most important the job of what he was supposed to do you see what i'm saying we don't do god right we look at human flesh and say oh we i'm that this you know brother brooks is brother brooks you have no idea when what god has to do sometime he dips into somebody else's funds just to give me something my wife will tell you i've had long distance help without asking yeah listen you say why is it that the message don't go out in these great big places these big crusades like amongst the denominations it's not their food it's not the church so-called food it's the bride's food it's spiritual food in season oh i want you to hear that that's why the message seemed to break forth sometimes in a season you've read it you've seen it but it but then there's a season where certain quotes and certain things he said began to blossom you say hi in the world i've read this i've listened to it so many times and i've never seen it because it wasn't for the season for it you see remember what what moses did the people cried for meat it wasn't the season for meat and they cried for me because they were tired of the manner and what happened they got sick the food was hard on them the meat was hard to you know me they they they took in too much and that's what's happening with the message they took in too much now everything they went down is coming up may god help us you know that's why preachers got to be careful you got to be careful that you're preaching the message that god wants you to preach at that time you can't say well lord i'm deep and i got it you'll kill people with it look at the revelations that once thought people once thought was not revelation because it was right now the thing that wasn't is why because the season things are being opened now that we can see you know the the time and and everything else is now caught up we can look back and see that the cloud in itself wasn't just some kind of demonstration it was god vindicating that jesus christ is the same yesterday and the day and forever he was vindicating he's the he's the same god amen that jehovah of the old testament is jesus christ of the new that's what he was doing and he was always also vindicating to to rebecca that he was the isaac let's come for her hallelujah it's spiritual food in season it will make them sick at their stomach talk about the dominations oh because when you start getting on your gods and all that people can't handle that when you get on serpentine they're like you know he's crazy the imagination goes wild he said it's too rich for them see you can't do it but for the children it's bread it's life it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever see that's what i'm talking about when elisha fully takes her position and i know sometimes some people may well she's already there all i'm gonna say i'm gonna say it like he told me to say it when she fully takes her position we're going to see something it won't it's going to be more than words hallelujah you see esther she had to have pressure the pressure has to come the squeeze has to come now i'm not saying oh we're going to wait no in the process of all of this you must continue to eat and eat and eat that word eat it eat it don't get tired of reading your bible don't get tired or listen to the taste don't get tired of praying you got to keep going on with this thing even when you don't see changes god is making changes who look at what a little yeast would do to bread just a little bit it'll blow that whole thing up think about the word you put the word in you don't worry about it it's going to do just what it says you're going to do look at what the word of god says in isaiah 55 9. we read there to the 13th verse for as they have i love this scripture i have a i see such a powerful revelation in it for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain coming down listen listen god uses such simplicity to show us the resurrection he shows us here reproduction he shows us resurrection in this little these two passages of scripture he says for as a rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater he just described what we call the circle of life so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void the whole thing everything i saw my word doing everything i spoke will come to pass you let's just say it like this a hundred years earlier let's say 200 years if you could describe the world today the way it is people would lock you up as being crazy you telling them that there's a cause that don't that doesn't need horses and stairs that you don't have to step on your step you just step on it you don't have to step up on it it'll ride you up or elevator you know that they think you're crazy really crazy and you know you just tell them about airplanes and all of these things that science had produced they would think you crazy but listen god said it god said in the last days knowledge will increase men will run to and fro he talks about it amen how chariots would be jostling going down the highway and everything coming into each other they didn't know how to describe it he called it a torch because you know at night you have your flash you have your lights on they didn't they didn't understand it horses carriages all that's in there you know you talk about revelation when when when when john saw the the the the the the uh beast with a tail or sting and you know and and shoot fire and had the face of a man he was looking at a helicopter he didn't know how to do it but he saw him in war shooting bombs dropping bombs he looked in there and he was the thing with the face of a man because the man is driving and flying it but that was his best bet he didn't know how to he took it and you know it was god purpose to hide it and you you you look at all of these movies and they got all kind of animals creatures coming out of space and everything i thought when god said that in this day and time we'll be seeing hideous sites i didn't know he was talking about people hideous people growing horns and you know just mutilating their faces and you know dying their hair all colors and you know what i'm saying don't even look human i'm not picking i'm just saying the bible said it was going to be and it is just like i preached uh down there you know there was at one time science used to stand for what was biology and science still for what was right night psychology is now saying hold it what you say doesn't matter anymore psychology is now the ruler it's true like i said you know i went to walmart and i'm not picking on nobody we've come from all walks of life but god has saved us amen but what i'm trying to say i was at walmart and and they said that the lady uh i was having trouble with the cash register and this woman says okay my my um manager she's going to come and help you out well when she came it wasn't she was he so my question is where will you stand when they say you got to form conform to what you t we telling you are you fired you got to call a man or she are you fired you gotta you got i don't listen change whatever you want to change you're going to still be what god said you are ain't no changing in that hate i saw something i was i don't even look at youtube i was looking at something on the news i forgot which part of the news where this lady this man who was once a lady he said they are not telling he said science is lying to the people he says since i trans he said i've been miserable fighting all kinds of diseases all kind of medication and everything i got to do to try to keep me myself looking like this and and she he said i don't know which one it was now but anyway and i'm not trying to be funny oh she said no matter what i have concluded i will never be a man and now this lady a man is trying to inform other people that science is lying to them i'm sorry i got on that but my point is we're in this day and don't tell me now because what what satan is the prince of air he's the airway he facebook and all these things that you're looking at all these things are designed to change your mind against the word amen you want to be yeah i don't want to be liberal we keep looking at what you're looking at because you're literally dealing with spirits that's going to make you compromise at the end you tell me i don't care what's been put on you i don't care what you come through i don't care you know you know i know that my god and your god can do do a seedling above whatsoever you ask or think there is not a scar that satan put on you that god can't remove i remember brother brown said he just prayed for this guy he had a cancer on his ear and and said when god healed him there was not even a scar y'all understand me if god can do it in the natural he can do it in the spiritual we got to trust him that's what i'm saying god did not call you to this message to send you to hell he did not but we've got to allow him to do his work do you see what i'm saying he went on and says listen just as nature in itself caused this thing to grow to blood and blossom he said my word will do it folks you got the seed of god in you do you have him you can't you there you couldn't even have the compassion for this word you couldn't have a love for this word if there was not a seed in you there's nothing about god satan likes especially his word and you can say amen to the word of this day it proves you elected you hear his voice some of us slower than the others hallelujah and listen you can be on a plum tree but every prom is not the same size that's a wonderful thing coming from the same tree and everything and you'll find some people when i was little when i was a little boy i looked for the big ones right so i'm ripening before others come from the same life and every one of us god had in his mind don't you ever let the devil listen i'm saying these because things you need to know when pressure comes when the squeeze come and all of the counsel of churches and everything come against you you got to realize death the devil is going to accuse you it's at that time you got to be certain of who you are hallelujah i don't care if they got old past sins and everything on tape oh yes that's you you say amen but god has sanctified me god has cleansed me god has purified me yes that's me that was me but look at me now see what i'm saying don't be afraid you've done what you done done is that correct english [Laughter] you don't mean i don't know how you translate that one but but god is good to us i don't want you to fear don't feel little flock it's the father's good will to give you the kingdom i'm talking about bride now don't don't you bride you hold on to it and i guarantee you you don't know you don't even understand why you believe you are amen something tells you you are in spite of all your failures something tells you that you are you hold on to it god has your season he's got your day hallelujah so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it and i'm talking about bride listen let me tell you something everything god has thought of you will come to pass there ain't a demon in the hell that can stop it i don't know how many demons i had when god saved me but it was a mini y'all can act like i was all sanctified if you want to i had a many of them i'm glad they didn't scream out like legion because i had them hallelujah but look what god has done nothing about his but his grace brother nothing but his grace so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing with the two i sent it for ye shall go out with joy listen this is the part i like this is this is me this is what god is talking to me you got to look at it like that he's speaking for you should go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all these trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of thorns shall come up the fig tree the fire tree and instead of the bride shall come up the moral tree and it shall be to the lord for to the lords for a name for everlasting signs that shall be shall not be cut off what are you saying the curse shall be removed amen hallelujah right now we're living in a cursed world every everything is cursed right everything got to die everything that's born dies even the rivers nowadays doesn't have a safe place to to reside is that right the world is shifting so much to the rivers are moving once once what what was a was a river is now some kind of desert or sand or something well places that used to be a lake there's no lakes anymore what's happening god is in control there's judgment that's striking the earth and people don't realize it they call it global warming yes it is global warming amen but god is doing it it ain't your exhaust i can tell you that now y'all remember when japan had that bad earthquake shifted the earth didn't it it literally moved the earth think about what i'm saying it moved the earth closer to the sun and it sped up that's why the days are shortened and god said except like short in the days no no flesh would be saved that's how he interpreted it that's how he interpreted now that you y'all know the days are faster what we used to be able to do in 24 hours or 12 hours is amazing nowadays you blink and it's already evening but that's just the way it is time is speeding up even though your clock says 24 he's not really 24. amen hallelujah i'm just telling you what is he doing he making the calendar go faster to cut to his appointed time his appointed time is coming amen hallelujah colossians 2 9-13 says for in him dwell the fullness of the god-head bodily ye are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and powers y'all understand me you're complete in him which is the head of all principalities and powers that means there's nothing that's not under your feet everything that satan has put out there is under your feet because you are in the head and you are completing him hallelujah which is the head of all principalities and powers in whom also you are cons you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hand in putting off the body of sin of the flesh by the circumcision of christ what is he saying you god didn't cut it off you got the holy ghost you worried about your flesh your flesh has been condemned god has cut it off god is not looking at this flesh he's looking at the inner man it's the inner man that's growing up into christ hallelujah since you've been buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who have raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all transgressions oh you see what people don't understand is that it's over it really is finished we're just going through the motions but if you read revelations revelation tells us what has already happened in the other dimension [Laughter] we're just catching up when mighty angel came down oh god people we don't understand we're moving through time and as they say as as as as we speed up there you go again as we speed up they're slowing down what is it because one day we're going to step yes sir one day we'll change this model into it he'll change his model into immortality hallelujah probably god said what a blessed thing you you do you love him say amen everything is complete now children everything is over there is no more battle there is no more warfare nothing you got to do it's already done we'll just rejoice we just rejoice oh my we are complete in him hallelujah he is the mighty conqueror folks not us he is jesus christ alone whoop the devil in all hell with him excuse me yes he did right listen he says listen are you coming you coming with this morning to confess that see that sin that i preached about this morning the sins of the world has been condemned and killed and you know more you are you're no more a servant to that thing but but is dead and you are coming to be buried in the name of him who died for you that's what people say well i you got to be baptized in the name of the father son in the name in the name of jesus christ because people say well how do you baptize i said i baptized according to matthew 28 18 and in acts 238 i said because matthew 28 tells us what to do and and acts 2 38 tells us how to do it you know and i don't understand why people have such a hard time with jesus because when you get sick you call on jesus when you're almost in a wreck you call on jesus you know when you're driving down the road and you're almost getting in an accident you said you don't say father son and holy ghost you say jesus i don't understand it people get healed i don't care you know what people don't understand because ain't no power now those are titles but the name no name and whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name hallelujah i remember a question years ago they had on the radio and the lady asked the question when we get to heaven which one we gonna see first father the son or the holy spirit you know what the announcer did he changed his such he changed if he asked me i told him the bible said there was only one set on the throne and that was jesus christ that's what you're going to see it was the bible he could have answered it and avoid the trinitarian thing they don't even know where it came from my goodness write out bell worship in the form of christianity and you are the coming to bear it in the name of him who died for you and killed sin for you and rose for your justification and you are complete in him not in no church not in branham tabernacle not in association but you are complete and safe in jesus christ give me a few more minutes it's a it's a change that change is approaching you know at some point in time abraham and sarah recognized their change and at some point in time if you listen to the messages how the prophet god describes this process now he was working with the natural but i'm gonna work with the spiritual because somewhere in your life you gotta understand there's a process of changing going on you in you you're not the way you used to be and you could see these changes constantly happen things that you even never thought uh you would separate from me but you're separating from them because you want to be a better christian see it's not you but it's god in you and and friends that used to really excite you about being friends no longer excites you because they don't believe the message or see it like you see it right and you're tired of all of the arguing over quotes and arguing about this doctrine and that doctrine because all you're interested is change i just want him to change me i don't care about all of this other stuff i know he's real just change me lord because no man can add one cupid to a statue and i realize i don't care how much you argue you know when you see ministers and brethren arguing through quotes and i'm not talking about sitting down and having a sensible conversation that's not what i'm talking about but striving with each other the holy spirit is not in that he said but one day we will be able to see him face to face that that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age partially realization will be made perfect realization complete realization hallelujah we have been looking through a glass darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him wondrously like him jesus our savior divine isn't that wonderful we are complete in him that is true he will not lie to us about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will be all swallowed up in life then we will realize realization i like that ooh let me skip because i i want to get to something hebrews 13 20-21 it says thou the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus christ that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good work how i don't know how he's doing it but the bible said make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen the prophet god said there is power and glory and blessings upon you and satan is defeated in the presence of christ see that's what we can't afford i'm almost done we cannot afford to let the church dry up we need the holy spirit moving and the only way that we can you got to come an expectation i don't care if 99 of the people are not responding we need one match to set a fire all we need is one person to get on fire and if that fire is real it'll light the other ones hallelujah hallelujah he put see satan is defeated he knows even satan knows he's he's he's on the earth he's going like a royal lion it isn't long till he he's finished he knows his time he's going like a roaring lion but remember the prince of peace stands by let me tell y'all something we have an unseen force working on our part you know elijah i mean elijah says lord open gahey's eyes right get hazel was all so afraid and upset when the syrians was all around him and everything else and you know elijah said what was what was that to me pretty much you said it you know he said you know there are more of us than them lord open this man's eye and when he saw when god opened his eyes and he saw that through that dimension he saw chariots of fire ready for battle see you and i we're never alone it's we only think that we're alone is when when our eyes are closed but when you're spiritual you know it may feel like i'm alone but i'm never alone right that's it see but remember the prince of peace stands by the great divine one the architect of my being the architect who built me what i am who built you what you are is here so what i'm saying is if you might look odds seem odd to everybody else but it's always been the odd stone that made everything fit together jesus christ was the odd stone they threw it away they didn't want it but the bride wants the odd stone he's the one that fits everything together and maybe you just kind of awkward a little different than everybody else but that doesn't mean that you you're not usable god uses the odd stone to bring things fit everything together how many times you've done puzzles and you find a piece of puzzle and you think where in the world this go and you find out that without it the puzzle is not complete that's just the way it works we needed thomas we needed peter right we needed matthew god used all those different variations of stones and he used it and built a foundation that the whole church is built upon it's built upon jesus christ but god used those men as the foundation you love the lord i'm closing i want to say the bible says to us peter he said upon this rock i build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it i would encourage you tonight whenever you get time and i know you probably listened to the tape before spiritual food in due season 1965 718. listen spiritually and find out which and and and go in there and see what you hear it's amazing it's amazing what you're going to see it it'll show you we're not far we need everything that's happening in this world right now we need it because most of the christians we become dolatory we become lazy and god is about ready to put it to us wake us up to the reality of who we are we need that we need that you know it's like the disciples they were so confident in themselves pretty much because they had jesus but when the world took jesus away and crucified him they realized they weren't nothing without him and so you found those ones after the crucifixion they went looking for him let me say it like this he's here but you got to go looking for him look him looking for him in his word and he'll reveal himself to you right that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a god that changes not let's pray oh heavenly father we so thank you for your grace and we thank you for your mercy we thank you for this time that you've given us to speak the word lord god changing his mask i didn't even come all the way lord but i trust that the saints of god understood where we were working with elisha how god changed his mask now we are the bride of jesus christ lord your bride declaring your word to be true because it is true we thank you father god for everything you've done for us and lord we're waiting on our change we can't change ourselves but we've given our hearts and souls to you lord if i've held anything back in my life hallelujah give us grace to surrender lord take full control of my life our lives that you may be glorified and that we would have complete fullness of life that you will be glorified help us now in your name jesus christ we pray bless those who came out today bless those who had a desire to come lord keep us in our health and strength lord your promise you are our healer our deliverer our friend above all friends bless us now in your name jesus christ we pray amen amen that's the song needed to come [Music] it's already done oh it's already done [Music] oh the battle is over the is it's already done i'm boring is over the oh is over the victory is oh my family saved my family's seat is is over it's already done oh it's already it's already done is [Music] unchanging hand unchanging is filled with on things i'm whatsoever you may breathe returned to god don't change heavenly treasure
