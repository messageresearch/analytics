the spirit of heaviness amen and tonight by God's grace we'll be talking about the oil of joy and the Garment of Praise amen because God wants us to be happy amen God wants us to keep on praising him every day amen that's what he that's what he said in his word that he's coming down to give us another of Joy instead of mourning amen he will dry up our tears amen and give us the joy amen give us a Reason To Praise Him amen that's the reason why he came down to died on the cross amen that's the reason he came and he endured all the pain and mockeries amen all of that because so that you can find a reason Amen to praise Him amen so that you can find a reason Amen to thank him amen no matter what you may be going through amen all through it amen you can't can still find a reason to praise God because the less we praise God Amen Behavior we get amen and we have less victories amen because some victories come we come with praise amen the more you praise him the more Victory you get amen the more you thank him amen the more Victory you get amen here the prophet here says in the the message calling Jesus on the sin amen paragraph six it be the first one amen he says here that now remember every redemp every Redemptive blessing has already been purchased amen the price is paid there is only one way that you'll ever be able to receive it the prophet say that is to believe it and to accept iten he is the high priest of our confession the Hebrew says uh the Hebrew letter says he's the higher priest of our [Music] profession to profess and confess is the same thing amen he is the high priest of our confession therefore he cannot do anything for us until first we confess that he has done it amen I'm going to read it again the prophet said that he cannot do anything for us until we confess it first and then when we confess it then he is the high priest a mediator to go to work on that and make it right the first thing first is to confess it amen the first thing first is to declare it amen you declare your own Victory you declare your own healing you declare your own Deliverance you confess it from your mouth amen and God will take it amen the holy spirit will take it am and bring it to the father amen the prophet said that and he will go to work and make it right amen he will go with that confession of yours amen and present it to the father amen here is the prayer of your CH of your children amen here's the prayer of your child amen he's been professing it amen he's been confessing his victory amen he's the higher priest of our confession amen because some battles you need to pray the Lord first before you receive the victory amen you need to stop praising God first before receiving the victory Amen brother Bram went to pray for uh for for a for a boy amen he was so sick the doctor gave up on him amen they had all the uh machines attached to his heart to his heart amen they were trying to read uh uh his heart and how his heart was work working amen

praising God am to start singing the the victory Amen to start shouting Amen to start thanking God for the victory that they about to have amen because they knew that God was with them amen and now we

have faith amen God will fight your battles amen you just have faith amen just stop praising him amen this is what the Prophet told them amen in verse 15 of the same chapter amen the prophet says he says and he said Heen he Judah all ye inhabitant of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehosaphat th sayth the Lord unto you Be not Afraid nor dismay by reason of this great multitude amen for the battle is not yours but God Amen Be not Afraid amen be not dismayed amen because the battle is not yours amen but it's God Amen you shall not need to fight in this battle amen set yourselves stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed amen because tomorrow go out against them and the Lord will be with you amen you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand you still and and see the salvation of the Lord oh Judah and Jerusalem amen the prophet said that you have to replace X by its value amen here is talking about Judah and Jerusalem amen and tonight we're talking about Higher Ground ground amen oh Higher Ground oh Higher Ground fear not nor be dism amen tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you amen tomorrow go out against them amen for the Lord is in you amen do not be dismayed do not fear don't fret God is with you amen you don't need to fight the battle is not yours but it's the Lord amen that was the word that the prophet told them amen it was this th sayth the Lord amen so we have to agree on one thing here amen the prophet says a prophet is a reflector of godet amen he's made he's made so that he cannot speak his own words amen he has to be God's words that he speaks he's just like a reflector and he is God's mouthpiece amen a prophet is a reflector of God he's made so that he cannot speak his own word amen so that everything that the prophet says amen it's coming from the Lord amen it doesn't matter even if it says th th sayth the Lord or not amen it's coming from the Lord you say where brother Isaac where here the prophet says that this is my opinion well it's coming from the Lord amen remember Paul when he was talking about marriage amen Paul says that this is me Paul talking amen but the same Bible says every scripture is inspired by God Amen so everything that the prophet says is inspired by God Amen he's God's mouth P amen what is the prophet telling us Amen in redemption in completeness and joy paragraph 63 amen he says that now to every believer born child of God when death comes stealing to the door Prophet says prematurely amen he said that the angel of God stands between you and sickness now if you want to run into it that's your business but you don't have to see he's standing between you and death amen every time you sick the angel of God is standing between you and death amen so it's your decision now amen you have to choose are you going to run run into death or are you going to be on the Lord's Side amen but not one thing that the angel of the Lord is standing between you and amen that is what the prophet of God is telling us amen so when you're sick amen believe that you have God in your son believe that your sickness amen you can't have healing for your sickness amen because you have a hidden Authority in you amen the prophet here says now the only thing you have to do then amen is to have faith in what you are and have or maybe it's have to have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are amen have faith in what you are and have faith in what the word says you are amen here I like the way the prophet just say it amen because it's covering everything amen you don't have faith about what you are yourself amen because you don't know what you are yet amen the prophet did not stop there he said that have faith in what the word says you are amen the word of God says that you are the Son of God so have faith in that amen the word of God says amen you are a priest and a king and a king amen so have faith in that amen so have faith in the what the word said you are amen and you will see everything coming to pass in your life amen so when you go through your trials amen ask yourself a question who am I amen and after you have the answer to that amen you will see that your attitude will change amen because if you realize that you are the Son of God Amen you know that you can go to your father amen at any moment amen anywhere amen you will ask him for something amen he's going to give it to you amen if you know that you are amen if you find the answer that you are a king amen a kingdom is not a democracy amen a kingdom amen it's dict dictatorship amen what the king says amen that's what will be done amen it doesn't matter if you agree or not amen amen if you say well I know that you know sometimes a king can't have a battle amen that he cannot overcome amen then you can switch by being a prince amen because when you're a prince amen your father is a king am and if God is your king amen there is no battle there is no battle that he can't overcome amen there is no battle amen that he can't win amen there is no Kingdom oh there is no Kings amen stronger than him amen so have faith in what the word says you [Music] are Isaiah 61 verse1 to3 amen the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the weak amen he has sent me he has sent me to the to Blind the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the of prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that morning Zion Amen to give unto them beautiful ashes the oil of joy for morning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified amen the spirit of the Lord is upon me amen has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek am man he had sent me to to to to sent me to Blind up the the to Blind up the Brokenhearted Amen to Proclaim Liberty to the captives amen so if you feel yourself that you're in captivity tonight amen there is liberty for you amen God is able to break all the chains amen look at Peter in prison amen he was all he was there all bound amen he was there Bound in all the chains amen but when the angel of the Lord came amen he broke all the shackles amen he broke all the chains amen and set him free amen so it doesn't matter the prison where you find yourself in amen believe that God is able to set you free amen he will set you free amen God is able amen so the reason why the church is not happy today amen it's because we have forgotten all the victories amen we have forgotten all our victories amen we we have forgotten once what we once were am like that eagle like that crow that was that was B that was bound that was in chain amen he was so in chance for so long amen he forgot how to fly amen he still had his his his wings with him amen his wings weren't cut off amen but he was in that situation for a long time he was in his trials for a long time amen he got comfortable with it amen he lost his identity amen he forgot who Jesus was amen he forgot who Jesus is amen he forgot that he still had wings amen sometimes we find ourselves in that same situation amen your faith is still in you amen for you to wake up amen it's Faith amen for you to drive from one point to another it's Faith amen for you to come to church it's faith amen but you find yourself in the situation where you find where you are in so long amen you've been in your trials for a long time amen you've forgotten the test of Victories amen amen you have forgotten what God is to you amen you have forgotten who Jesus is to you amen you you made yourself comfortable amen like the children of Israel amen they were so comfortable in Egypt amen they couldn't see the blessings that were in front of them amen they wanted to go back amen instead of enduring a little bit little a little while amen so God doesn't change amen if it was just the same God yesterday amen he's still the same God today the reason is amen we stopped trusting him am the reason is is amen we stop having faith in him but we have to be like job amen it doesn't matter if the day is getting harder amen I'm praying amen but my children's are dead amen I'm praying every day amen my cattles are [Applause] gone amen I'm praying every day amen my body is becoming sick my body is becoming sick amen but still my faith will not change amen because it's rest on the Solid Ground amen it's on the solid it's on the Solid Rock Amen the prophet said that that's what's the matter with the church today man we're too long forgotten that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we forgot that our God Is A Healer amen can make the sick well amen we forgot that the baptism of the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the disciples amen and given from generation to generation for anybody whosoever will whosoever will could come amen we for for gotten that amen long long ago amen we've forgotten that God is our healer amen now we're fine with we're fine with taking pills every day I mean I'm not nothing against it amen but we forget sometimes that God can heal you amen you feel so comfortable with it you have a set schedule amen that every morning I have to take this and that amen and if you if you miss one or an hour pass amen you're so worried about what will happen to you amen so what about God what about God Amen he's still able to heal you amen he's still able to recover you to give you back back your strength amen he's still able to give you back your good health amen we just have to trust him amen we just have to believe him amen it seems like the Christian Life if the fellow is not absolutely centered in is not absolutely set on Christ centered on Christ the Christian life seems like or holds so many disappointments but those disappointments are God's Divine will happening for us now it don't seem like it it don't seem like it will be that but it's God's way of doing things amen he lets us hit the [Music] river to see what we will do amen he let us get to those point where we feel like there is no more hope amen where we feel like there is no more solutions amen just to see our reactions amen look at the Hebrew children amen they stood for God amen but yet the king ordered that the the fire be HED seven times harder than it was before amen certainly they were hoping that to God for God to intervene before they got to the fire amen but God brought them to that point amen just to see what they will do amen just to see their reaction amen and because they stood for God amen God stood for them amen God was there to quench the fire for them amen look at Daniel Amen he stood for God Amen the king made a decree amen not to pray in the name of the Lord amen but Daniel stood there started praying amen when he was being cast into the lion's den amen maybe Daniel Daniel was was hoping for God to intervene before he got there amen but God was just waiting Amen to see what he will do Amen to see his reaction amen because God because Daniel stood for God Amen God was there for him amen he closed the the mouth of the the mouth of the Lions amen it was the same way with Paul Amen on his to Rome amen it was God who sent Paul to Rome amen Paul did not send himself to Rome amen he had a commission from God Amen to go bring the gospel to Rome amen so here is Paul on his way to Rome amen everything is just looking you know not you know as if God wasn't there amen Paul himself says amen all hope was was gone amen but in that same but in that moment amen when all hope was gone amen he kept on believing God and God gave him a promise amen God visited Paul am and Paul rose up the next morning amen he says that the angel of the Lord came to me amen Don't Be Afraid am because no one will die am because God that I serve amen he will Deliver Us amen why because Paul kept un believing amen when all hope was gone amen Paul kept on believing amen God was there to deliver them amen even though the bu wrecked amen the ship wrecked amen yet Paul had the the word of God and nobody lost his life amen because he kept on believing him amen look at John on the out of pmos amen he kept on believing God Amen no matter what they put him through amen put him on Boiling oil amen that didn't change his faith amen God brought the AC on that oil am because of his faith in God Amen look at the apostles amen all of of them were persecuted you have Peter was chained in prison amen you have this one was killed and this one had this amen but yet they didn't they didn't disbelieve God Amen here's Steven amen being stoned to death amen but even in the moment of death amen he still had faith in God Amen even the moment of death amen he's kept on beleving God Amen Jesus Christ himself amen when he was about to give up amen you prayed father take this cup away from me because the trial was so hard am the cross was so heavy amen he couldn't bury it by himself amen he felt like all hope was gone amen then he said father Amen Let thy will be done Amen Let th will be done not my will by thy will oh Lord amen all of them none of them had an easy life amen they had to go through trials amen they had to go through hard times but no matter what they went through they kept on praising God Amen no no matter what they went through Amen on their way to trials they were singing victory songs amen they weren't sad amen they weren't crying amen there is no record of them crying there is no record of them being sad amen because the moment you start crying amen that means that you no longer have a 100 100% faith amen the moment you start crying amen the moment your your face becomes sad amen that means that you start losing faith in God Amen if that happens amen it's fine amen because as human sometimes we just can't handle those times anymore [Music] sometimes amen but in those moments of your life amen when it seems like all hope is gone am when it feels like everybody's against you amen when it feels like everything is against you amen just look beyond the clouds amen the sun is still shining amen you might not see it amen but the sun is still shining amen you just keep on praising God Amen you can say like Moses who is unto thee oh Lord among all the gods who is like thee glorious Holiness glorious in Holiness amen fearful in Praises doing wonders amen thou stretches out thy right hand am the Earth swallowed them amen thou in thy mercy has led forth the people which thou has redeemed thou has guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation who is on who is onto the who is who is who is unto thee Oh Lord who is like unto thee Oh Lord nobody amen I looked in the heavens I looked on Earth amen I went back to history amen still I couldn't find somebody who was like you amen so that that the the the writers said that to write the love of God is impossible amen because it will stretch from Sky to Sky amen you might start saying it today amen you will never finish you can have it town a thousand years to praise him you will never get bored amen because his merci is renewed every morning amen and as long as his Mercy is renewed every morning amen I will always have a reason to praise him amen amen the prophet here says the last quote before we so that we can close amen he says in the in the Victory Day He said now don't fail this don't fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found you found favor with God and God believes that you will stand the test amen
