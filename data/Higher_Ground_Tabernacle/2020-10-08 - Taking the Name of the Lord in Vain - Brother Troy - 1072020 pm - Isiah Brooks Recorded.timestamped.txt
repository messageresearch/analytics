[32:36] amen i didn't come here for any
[32:39] tradition
[32:40] i didn't come here for any other reason
[32:43] but i came here because jesus said
[32:45] that wherever two or three are gathered
[32:47] in my name
[32:49] all the way on down throughout all
[32:50] history down through the ages
[32:52] wherever two or three are gathered in my

[32:57] amen hebrews 13 8 when he comes he'll be
[32:59] the same yesterday today and forever

[33:06] chapter 20
[33:09] seventh verse i want to speak a message
[33:13] entitled taking the name of the lord in
[33:22] vain
[33:25] exodus 20 verse
[33:28] verse 7 familiar verse and it says
[33:31] thou shalt not take the name of the lord
[33:35] thy god in vain
[33:38] for the lord will not hold him guiltless
[33:42] that taketh his name in vain
[33:45] amen i just want to read that one more
[33:47] time thou
[33:49] shalt not take the name of the lord thy
[33:52] god in vain
[33:54] for the lord will not hold him guiltless
[33:58] that taketh his name in vain
[34:01] anyway now let's turn over to uh
[34:08] matthew chapter 25.
[34:25] matthew chapter 25
[34:28] verse 14 and it says for the kingdom of
[34:32] heaven
[34:33] is as a man traveling into a far country
[34:37] who called his own servants and
[34:38] delivered unto them
[34:40] his goods and he gave one
[34:44] into one he gave five talents to another
[34:47] he gave two
[34:49] to another one and to every man
[34:52] according to his several ability and
[34:54] straight away he took his journey
[34:57] and then he that had the five talents
[34:59] went and traded with the same
[35:01] and he made another five talents and
[35:04] likewise he that had received two
[35:06] he also gained another two but he that
[35:09] had received the one
[35:11] went and digged in the earth and he hid
[35:15] his lord's money amen now let's just uh
[35:21] stop right there bower heads and word of
[35:24] prayer
[35:25] heavenly father we just approach unto
[35:27] you this evening lord
[35:28] knowing lord that you keep every one of
[35:30] your appointments father and
[35:32] you made an appointment to meet with us
[35:34] this evening and
[35:35] in honor of that appointment and that
[35:39] appointment that calendar meeting that
[35:40] you gave unto us lord
[35:42] we come tonight and lord in honor of
[35:44] that lord we bow our heads and we pray
[35:46] we listen to your word and we say lord
[35:49] be it unto us
[35:50] lord according to thy word whatever it
[35:52] is it seems pleasing unto thy sight
[35:54] father
[35:55] just speak it lord and we'll say yes and
[35:57] amen and i am joining my hearts with
[35:59] these here
[36:00] in the congregation father the lord
[36:02] whatever it is that you would say out of
[36:03] your word we say
[36:05] yes and amen to your word so lord we
[36:07] just
[36:08] humbly open up our hearts to you say in
[36:11] whatever seems good in your sight father
[36:14] let it be done unto us according to thy
[36:15] word in the name of the lord jesus
[36:17] christ we pray
[36:19] amen amen you can be seated
[36:23] amen you know the ten commandments
[36:26] as we read there in the beginning it's a
[36:29] very familiar scripture
[36:31] that there that we read was the third
[36:33] commandment thou shalt not take the name
[36:35] of the lord in vain
[36:37] and you know many you know all as we
[36:39] learned growing up as
[36:41] it was spoke to us as we grew up as
[36:43] children that that was talked about you
[36:45] know
[36:45] swearing or you know or or saying the
[36:48] name of the lord in vain not to say
[36:51] use the name of the lord as a swear word
[36:53] as me people you know you'll hear people
[36:55] say
[36:56] oh my god and different things and it
[36:58] always makes me cringe when you hear
[36:59] people say that
[37:01] you know because we were taught as
[37:03] children
[37:04] don't do that you know don't take the
[37:06] name of god don't let the name of god
[37:08] be taken flippantly you know but as
[37:10] jesus said
[37:11] as he took the ten commandments and they
[37:13] took about the
[37:14] adultery he says but whosoever looks
[37:17] upon a woman
[37:18] you know never mind just the actual act
[37:20] but i want to take it a step further
[37:22] take it a step higher that whosoever
[37:24] even looked upon a woman
[37:26] as he took the commandment and he took
[37:28] it a step higher so i just wanted to
[37:29] take this commandment here the third
[37:31] commandment and i want to take it a step
[37:33] higher amen
[37:34] amen about taking the name of the lord
[37:36] in vain because taking it beyond just
[37:38] taking it as a swear word for
[37:40] all of us that have called ourselves
[37:42] christians in this last day
[37:44] that have called ourselves the bride of
[37:46] the lord jesus christ
[37:47] that somehow the word of the lord in
[37:49] this last layout of cnh
[37:52] where many are going to go down into
[37:53] lukewarmness many are the bi as the
[37:55] bible said in revelations chapter 3
[37:58] that in the last days many will be
[38:00] lukewarm
[38:02] darkness will be upon the church amen
[38:04] the church will become a
[38:05] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[38:09] in the midst of those last days there
[38:11] will be someone that will be called an
[38:12] overcomer amen
[38:13] amen there's going to be someone that's
[38:15] going to overcome these things
[38:17] there's going to be someone that's going
[38:18] to overcome lukewarmness there's going
[38:20] to be someone that's going to overcome
[38:22] the foolishness of this age the deadness
[38:24] of the churches
[38:25] the churches that live in sin uh the
[38:27] churches that live in
[38:29] the evil spirits that are roaming
[38:31] amongst the churches freely they're not
[38:33] being rebuked
[38:34] they're not being chastened amen but
[38:37] there will be a bride of the lord jesus
[38:39] christ they'll rise up and say
[38:41] unto thy word lord i clean amen it's
[38:44] unto those that the spirit of the living
[38:45] god is coming in this last day
[38:47] amen upon those he's knocking upon the
[38:50] heart's door
[38:51] and it's upon those they opened up their
[38:53] door and they said lord come on in
[38:55] and the word of the lord spoke to that
[38:57] bride and said
[39:00] in acts chapter 2 verse 38 he said you
[39:03] know they said
[39:04] what shall we do when peter was
[39:07] was preaching that great sermon after
[39:09] the day of pentecost and they saw the
[39:11] power of god was
[39:12] released to the church and everybody
[39:14] came and they said what shall we do
[39:16] and peter looked at him and he gave out
[39:18] the prescription
[39:19] dr simon peter wrote out the
[39:21] prescription for sin
[39:22] and disease and he says repent that's
[39:26] right
[39:26] amen repent everyone
[39:29] be baptized in the name of the lord
[39:31] jesus christ
[39:33] and you shall be saved you shall be
[39:36] saved from your sins amen that is the
[39:38] prescription to go on down through the
[39:40] ages
[39:41] amen he was the doctor he had the he
[39:44] knew what was wrong with the people
[39:45] amen jesus had taught him well and jesus
[39:48] gave him he says
[39:49] uh unto you i give you the keys of the
[39:51] kingdom and
[39:52] peter went right out and with those keys
[39:55] he unlocked that door and says whosoever
[39:57] repents
[39:58] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[40:00] receives is baptized in the name of the
[40:02] lord jesus christ
[40:03] they will be saved and ever since then
[40:07] ever since then that's been the general
[40:08] orders
[40:10] the general orders they shall be saved
[40:13] but let me tell you whosoever goes down
[40:16] into baptism
[40:17] they go down into their waters and as
[40:20] the pre
[40:21] as the minister calls out over them in
[40:24] the name of the lord jesus christ i
[40:26] baptize you into the name of the lord
[40:29] jesus christ
[40:30] and the bible says and they rise up out
[40:32] of the waters and they walk in newness
[40:34] of life
[40:38] they are taking the name of the lord
[40:40] jesus christ upon them
[40:43] revelation says his name will be written
[40:46] upon their foreheads we're living in the
[40:49] days where
[40:50] everybody is going to receive a seal
[40:52] amen
[40:53] the one will receive the seal of the
[40:55] holy ghost
[40:56] amen because it's an inheritance to all
[40:58] that are baptized in the name of the
[41:00] lord jesus christ
[41:02] the others will receive the seal of the
[41:05] mark of the beast
[41:06] amen why because that is the inheritance
[41:09] of those
[41:09] that receive why because there are two
[41:11] spirits that are living in the church
[41:13] there is a spirit of the living almighty
[41:15] god and there is the spirit of the beast
[41:17] and the
[41:18] from the ages old amen and those two
[41:20] spirits
[41:21] someone will receive one some will
[41:24] receive other
[41:24] some will be marked with the holy ghost
[41:27] some will be marked with the
[41:29] with the mark of the beast amen but to
[41:31] those that are sealed with the holy
[41:33] ghost
[41:33] they receive the seal of the lord jesus
[41:36] christ
[41:36] they're taking up the name of the lord
[41:38] but let me say
[41:40] unto you right now if you're taking up
[41:42] the name of the lord
[41:43] don't look look back look back to this
[41:45] commandment right here
[41:46] don't take the name of the lord in vain
[41:50] that word vein there means empty
[41:54] empty
[41:57] you took it up for no cause
[42:01] you grabbed the name of the lord and you
[42:03] went running but
[42:04] you ran aimless you took the name of the
[42:07] lord but
[42:08] nothing ever came to it you took the
[42:11] name of the lord in baptism but
[42:12] where is the fruits amen god is coming
[42:16] back for a church
[42:17] and he has a right to the fruits amen as
[42:20] jesus says that the husbandman had the
[42:22] right to the fruits amen
[42:24] amen the the the one that owns the
[42:26] garden
[42:27] has a right to come and inherit the
[42:29] fruit remember jesus one day he was
[42:31] walking
[42:32] and he the bible says that he began to
[42:34] get a little hungry
[42:36] amen he began to get a little hungry and
[42:38] he walks up to a fig tree you know and
[42:40] he was there
[42:42] when fig trees were created
[42:45] amen he was the one that spoke fig trees
[42:47] into existence
[42:49] he is the one that wrote the dna of the
[42:51] fig tree
[42:52] and it went down on generation after
[42:54] generation after generation
[42:56] bearing fruit and bearing fruit and
[42:57] bearing fruit and this
[42:59] and this fig tree that he's walking up
[43:01] to is the great great great great great
[43:02] great grandson of the original tree
[43:06] amen he walks up to it and he had a
[43:08] right to partake
[43:09] amen of the the fruits of that fig tree
[43:12] hey he walks up and he starts
[43:14] parting the branches and he look
[43:17] puts this branch up over here and he
[43:18] looks the whole tree over and there was
[43:20] not
[43:20] one speck of fruit on the whole tree hey
[43:23] man he looks at that tree and he curses
[43:25] that tree and he says
[43:27] let no man partake of you from his north
[43:30] now forever
[43:32] let no man ever partake of you ever
[43:35] again
[43:37] and the disciples they saw that and like
[43:39] that's
[43:40] pretty bold it's a bold statement you
[43:44] know
[43:44] why were you getting angry at the street
[43:46] you know and they go on about their
[43:48] journey and the day gets
[43:49] grows long and they back and and now
[43:52] it's getting late in the day and they're
[43:54] going back to where they're going to
[43:55] sleep that night
[43:55] and all of a sudden they pass by this
[43:57] tree and they see it it's all
[43:58] wilted the leaves are drying up and
[44:01] falling off
[44:02] and the disciples says master
[44:06] that tree that you cursed just this
[44:08] morning is already dying
[44:10] and jesus says take note
[44:14] every branch amen every tree
[44:18] that my father plants will be pruned
[44:22] if it bears not fruit it'll be cast into
[44:25] the fire
[44:26] but if it bears fruit it will be pruned
[44:28] so it might bear more fruit amen
[44:30] why because god has a right amen to come
[44:33] and enjoy the fruits of his bread
[44:36] to come and enjoy the fruits of his
[44:38] church amen and woe unto those that are
[44:40] taking the name of the lord in vain
[44:43] they took they went down into baptism
[44:45] they received the word of the lord with
[44:47] gladness
[44:48] remember the the parable of the uh the
[44:50] stony ground
[44:52] the seed that went into the stony ground
[44:54] the jesus said
[44:55] those are the ones that they receive the
[44:58] lord with gladness
[44:59] they hear the word of the lord they
[45:01] accept they're happy
[45:02] they're excited they're enjoying like my
[45:04] what a great message
[45:06] my what a powerful look at the signs
[45:08] so-and-so is healed
[45:09] so-and-so was delivered amen the
[45:11] presence of the lord came down and
[45:14] this person who had this problem for 20
[45:16] years was delivered and
[45:17] never took another uh drug again never
[45:20] took another drink again and they were
[45:21] delivered in an instant amen
[45:23] they had cancer and they were healed and
[45:24] where and we rejoice in those things
[45:27] but all of a sudden then they go off and
[45:28] they never actually bear fruit why they
[45:30] are so excited to see the presence of
[45:32] the lord
[45:33] they're so excited to see the acts of
[45:35] jesus christ and living in the church
[45:37] they're so excited to see all these
[45:38] things but then all of a sudden
[45:40] you look at their lives and where did
[45:42] they go where
[45:43] are they where are they there's been
[45:46] people here that have danced in the
[45:47] spirit amen
[45:48] there's people here that have seen the
[45:50] signs they've seen the wonders they've
[45:52] seen people healed in this very
[45:53] congregation
[45:54] but where are they at they received the
[45:56] word with joy but where did they go
[45:58] amen all of a sudden they will they the
[46:00] bible says they had no roots
[46:02] amen they had no root why and god has a
[46:05] right to
[46:06] to to to to to enjoy the fruits
[46:09] of his bride but now where did they go
[46:11] they're no longer bearing fruit
[46:13] why they took the name of the lord they
[46:15] went down to the waters of baptism
[46:17] they rose up but they never walked in
[46:19] newness of the life of the holy ghost
[46:21] they they never walked in the newness of
[46:23] life the holy spirit can never live in
[46:24] them
[46:26] amen remember brother branham said that
[46:28] the the the book of acts
[46:30] wasn't necessarily the acts of the
[46:32] apostles amen it was the acts of the
[46:34] holy ghost
[46:35] in the apostles amen and that's so it's
[46:38] supposed to be
[46:38] every true church is supposed to write
[46:41] another book of acts behind it
[46:42] amen why because if the holy spirit is
[46:44] living amongst the church
[46:46] the holy spirit wants to move the holy
[46:48] spirit wants to act why because
[46:50] he is the same yesterday today and
[46:52] forever amen as we said there sunday
[46:54] you know the talking about uh uh jesus
[46:58] said
[46:58] wherever you on down throughout history
[47:01] amen i
[47:02] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[47:03] name i will be right there in the midst
[47:06] amen wherever you are gathering two or
[47:08] three gather them together in my name
[47:10] don't take my name in vain now but
[47:12] gathered truly in my name i will be
[47:14] right there in the midst of them
[47:16] amen and then as saint paul wrote there
[47:18] we gave the little parable about saint
[47:20] paul
[47:20] he was writing the uh the letter to the
[47:23] hebrews and he
[47:25] maybe paused there for a few days and
[47:28] went to pick up his pen and
[47:29] had his little table there and his
[47:31] little lamp and he sits down and starts
[47:33] writing hebrews chapter 13 and he
[47:35] writes the first verse the second verse
[47:37] and just as his
[47:39] hand is moved by the holy ghost and he's
[47:41] writing
[47:42] led by this the bible says that men of
[47:44] old led by the holy ghost
[47:46] wrote the scriptures and as he's writing
[47:48] there he writes the seventh verse down
[47:50] and
[47:51] he kind of pauses sets down his pen and
[47:53] all sudden the holy spirit speaks to him
[47:54] and says
[47:55] tell them hallelujah let the people know
[48:00] write it down so that all the ages will
[48:03] know that
[48:03] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[48:07] and forever
[48:08] and so he wrote that great scripture
[48:09] hebrews 13 8 jesus christ
[48:12] the same yesterday today and forever
[48:14] amen
[48:15] we got and we we gotta believe in that
[48:18] amen we gotta accept that we gotta let
[48:20] the holy spirit
[48:21] move across that scripture brood across
[48:24] that scripture
[48:25] just like the uh the holy spirit did uh
[48:27] uh
[48:28] back when the world was in darkness amen
[48:30] holy spirit
[48:31] in genesis 1 moved over the dark over
[48:34] the dark waters
[48:35] and as he was moving brooding over the
[48:37] dark waters all of a sudden
[48:39] land began to come up amen then trees
[48:42] begin to sprout
[48:42] amen and so the same thing with the holy
[48:45] spirit will be against you allowing the
[48:46] brood over your life
[48:48] amen then signs wonders amen life
[48:52] the holy ghost amen begins brooding and
[48:54] brooding he's brooding over you
[48:56] was he rooting because he has a right to
[48:58] partake of the fruit of your life
[49:01] so but don't take the name of the lord
[49:03] if you're going to come upon this life
[49:05] journey
[49:05] count the cost the lord jesus said
[49:08] count the cost amen count the cost of
[49:12] coming upon this way
[49:13] but let me tell you it does pay off
[49:16] it does pay off amen let's just turn
[49:19] over
[49:19] our bibles to book a joshua chapter five
[49:32] you know the book of joshua is a great
[49:34] book
[49:35] they've been traveling for an entire
[49:37] generation
[49:38] they left egypt under the mighty hand of
[49:42] jehovah
[49:43] amen it's uh joshua
[49:46] 5 verse 1 we're going to read from they
[49:48] left egypt
[49:49] out of the mighty hand of jehovah he
[49:52] took them out of there
[49:53] delivered them signs and wonders amen
[49:56] they saw so
[49:58] much how could they doubt saw so much
[50:01] how could they
[50:02] not believe amen they saw they saw a god
[50:05] in action
[50:07] i i don't know about you but just seeing
[50:10] you know and even as a minister some of
[50:12] the things i've seen god do
[50:14] it's it's it's just you never get over
[50:17] it
[50:20] the first time i saw someone get healed
[50:23] by the laying on hands
[50:26] it shocked me not that god would do it
[50:28] but that god would do it through me
[50:32] and when i saw it i began to realize
[50:34] that it wasn't about my abilities
[50:37] it wasn't about my power it wasn't about
[50:40] my strength
[50:41] it wasn't about how worthy i was or how
[50:44] good i was
[50:45] or how how good of a life i'd been
[50:47] leading
[50:48] but by allowing the word of god to go
[50:50] into action
[50:51] putting trust in his word amen and just
[50:54] letting
[50:55] the word work just giving god a chance
[50:58] to act
[50:59] sometimes we just need to give god room
[51:01] to act in our lives
[51:04] amen we try to do so much on our own so
[51:07] much on our own but let me tell you
[51:08] put put put god to the test lay your
[51:11] prayer upon the altar
[51:13] i let god lord i'm just going to trust
[51:15] in you on this lord
[51:16] i just i know i could do this lord i
[51:19] know that maybe i have a right to do it
[51:20] in my own strength or something
[51:22] like that but lord i just want to see
[51:24] you in action
[51:26] i just want to see you in action in my
[51:28] life and let it be a beautiful thing to
[51:30] you
[51:30] amen because when all life when life's
[51:32] journey is over
[51:33] some of the greatest things in our life
[51:35] is when god acted on our behalf
[51:37] amen amen amen you know some of the
[51:41] greatest prayers
[51:42] or answers of prayer i've ever got ever
[51:44] had were not the ones that i fasted and
[51:46] prayed for
[51:47] but just the ones where i said oh lord i
[51:48] need this just now and god just
[51:50] answers i didn't fast i didn't pray i
[51:53] just said one quick prayer and all of a
[51:55] sudden
[51:55] i also knew maybe the day or two later
[51:58] you think oh my
[52:00] he just did it but i didn't have to try
[52:03] i didn't think you know
[52:04] like the bible says before you even
[52:07] think to ask
[52:08] i will answer amen
[52:11] joshua chapter 5 they've been going to
[52:14] the
[52:14] promised land now or through the
[52:16] wilderness for 40 years
[52:18] and they're finally coming into the land
[52:20] of promise
[52:21] amen god has led them out of the mighty
[52:23] hand they parted the red sea
[52:25] and now they've just seen the jordan
[52:27] part amen and
[52:29] come to this verse here after they cross
[52:31] over the river jordan
[52:32] and it says in verse 1 and it came to
[52:35] pass
[52:36] to when all the kings and the amorites
[52:39] which were on the side of jordan
[52:41] westward
[52:42] and all the kings the canaanites which
[52:43] were by the sea
[52:45] heard that the lord had dried up the
[52:47] waters of jordan
[52:49] from before the children of israel until
[52:51] they were passed over
[52:53] that their heart melted you know i don't
[52:56] blame him
[52:58] they thought that jordan was protecting
[52:59] him but all of a sudden when god just
[53:02] took it out of the way their heart began
[53:05] to melt
[53:06] i don't blame him amen
[53:09] their heart melted and neither was their
[53:11] spirit in them anymore because
[53:14] of the children of israel how would you
[53:16] like to go to battle against the
[53:17] children of israel just now
[53:19] watching god march before them
[53:22] i think i'd just run the other way i'll
[53:24] go find me a new home somewhere else i'm
[53:26] heading to egypt
[53:31] their heart melted so here they are at
[53:34] the pinnacle they're entering into their
[53:36] inheritance
[53:37] the pinnacle of their journey and what
[53:40] does god tell them to do next
[53:42] what is the next step all power of god
[53:45] is behind them
[53:46] they're living in victory and everything
[53:48] is is behind them and they're getting
[53:50] ready to march in and take over all
[53:52] their enemies
[53:53] and what's the next step
[53:56] verse 2 at that time the lord said unto
[53:59] joshua
[54:00] make these sharp knives and circumcise
[54:04] again the children of israel
[54:06] the second time and joshua made him
[54:09] sharp
[54:10] knives and circumcised the children of
[54:11] israel at the hill of the foreskins
[54:14] let's go on down to uh verse seven
[54:18] and it says and their children whom he
[54:19] raised up in their stead
[54:21] them joshua circumcised for they were
[54:24] uncircumcised because they had not
[54:26] circumcised them by the way and when it
[54:29] came to pass that when they were done
[54:31] circumcising all the people
[54:33] that they abode in their places in the
[54:35] camp until they were made whole
[54:38] and then the lord said unto joshua this
[54:40] day
[54:42] have i rolled away the reproach of egypt
[54:46] from off of you
[54:50] this is the day that the reproach of
[54:52] egypt
[54:53] was rolled off of them amen you know
[54:57] when mary when moses and miriam were
[54:59] dancing on the red sea shore
[55:01] after they came out of egypt the
[55:03] approach of egypt was still upon
[55:06] when moses stroked the hit the rock in
[55:09] the wilderness
[55:12] there they were and the water came out
[55:13] and two million people were able to
[55:15] drink in the middle of the
[55:16] in the middle of the desert with water
[55:18] and all that approach of egypt
[55:20] still upon them when the
[55:23] man was coming down from heaven approach
[55:27] of egypt was still upon them
[55:30] think about that if they would have all
[55:33] died
[55:34] right there in the wilderness and never
[55:36] went a step further
[55:37] they would have said the people would
[55:39] say well there are the people the slaves
[55:41] of egypt
[55:43] the left egypt saying their god would
[55:45] deliver them and there they are
[55:47] dead under the sand rotting in the
[55:49] desert floor
[55:52] egyptian slaves
[55:55] let me tell you no egyptian slaves were
[55:58] going to inherit that promised land
[56:00] they had to leave that slavery behind
[56:02] amen
[56:03] no egyptian slave was going to inherit
[56:06] that promised land
[56:07] amen and until they crossed the river
[56:10] jordan they were still just escaped
[56:12] slaves
[56:13] why because they had no inheritance
[56:17] it doesn't matter if they crossed the
[56:19] red sea it didn't matter if the
[56:21] man had fallen didn't matter that they
[56:23] had drank from the water in the
[56:24] wilderness
[56:25] it didn't matter if they had seen the
[56:26] pillar of fire up on the mountain top
[56:29] didn't matter they had followed moses
[56:31] all the days of their life
[56:32] amen let me tell you until they crossed
[56:35] the river jordan
[56:36] until they were circumcised the second
[56:38] time their approach of egypt was still
[56:40] upon them
[56:41] why they had no inheritance and let me
[56:44] tell you
[56:44] the only inheritance that we have this
[56:47] day
[56:48] is the life of the lord jesus christ on
[56:50] the inside
[56:51] that is our inheritance i don't care if
[56:54] you say that i repented
[56:56] i don't care if you say that that that
[56:58] that i was baptized in the name of the
[57:00] lord jesus christ
[57:01] but if you just take the name of the
[57:03] lord in vain
[57:04] it's an empty an empty name to you
[57:06] nothing's ever come of it
[57:08] you can't point to anything in your life
[57:09] that god has ever done for you
[57:11] then let me tell you you do not have an
[57:13] inheritance amen you're just an egyptian
[57:15] slave
[57:16] but let jesus christ come down amen
[57:19] bring the answer
[57:20] fill you with his holy spirit fill you
[57:22] with his with him why
[57:24] because it's got to be the life of
[57:26] christ jesus christ is coming back
[57:28] not for your life he's coming back for
[57:30] his life in you
[57:32] amen he's coming back to see himself in
[57:34] you
[57:35] amen but if he comes back and he can't
[57:37] see himself in you

[57:44] say unto you they will not enter into my
[57:46] kingdom

[57:49] the father amen the will of the father
[57:51] is to receive the holy ghost
[57:54] the will of the father is the keys that
[57:56] were opened on the day of pentecost when
[57:58] peter said
[57:59] repent and be baptized in the name of
[58:00] the lord jesus christ and you
[58:02] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[58:05] and the holy ghost is the life of the
[58:07] lord jesus

[58:16] lutherans it's not a doctrine of the
[58:18] methodists
[58:19] it's not a doctrine of the pentecostals
[58:21] amen the the
[58:22] the the catholics say when you take the
[58:24] holy eucharist you got the holy ghost
[58:27] they have to say when you believe you

[58:32] in confirmation class
[58:34] upon you you we are confirming that you
[58:37] have the holy ghost
[58:38] the pentecostals say that when you speak
[58:40] in tongues
[58:41] you got the holy ghost but let me tell
[58:43] you it's none of those things
[58:45] it's not a doctrine it's the life of
[58:47] jesus christ who is the same yesterday
[58:49] today and forever
[58:50] and he will come down on the inside of
[58:52] you and he will live

[1:05:53] adam uh was told be
[1:05:56] fruitful and multiply i want you to be
[1:05:59] fruitful and multiply
[1:06:00] but he looked at himself he says lord
[1:06:04] am alone why was he alone

[1:06:11] god's image
[1:06:14] oh lord how can i be fruitful how can we
[1:06:17] how can i multiply
[1:06:19] and god says well let me just show you a
[1:06:21] little parable here

[1:06:50] i'm alone how can i be fruitful how can
[1:06:53] i multiply i'm alone
[1:06:56] and the bible says that he god brought
[1:06:58] all the animals by adam
[1:07:00] so that he could see what adam would
[1:07:02] name them
[1:07:05] and he named them but let me tell you he
[1:07:07] didn't call any of them bride
[1:07:10] not one of those animals did he call
[1:07:11] bride he just gave him their names
[1:07:14] that's not my kind that's not my kind
[1:07:16] that's not my kind

[1:07:39] alone how can i do it and god all of a
[1:07:41] sudden
[1:07:41] takes adam and he puts him to sleep
[1:07:45] and he reaches down into adam's side
[1:07:48] and he pulls out part of adam and out of
[1:07:51] adam
[1:07:53] he makes a bride oh he didn't take out
[1:07:57] of the animal race
[1:07:58] he didn't take out of the the plants
[1:08:01] or the birds or the land creatures
[1:08:05] he took he reached down on the inside of
[1:08:07] adam
[1:08:08] because on the inside of adam there was
[1:08:10] something amen the god had hidden there
[1:08:12] amen something that was in adam all that
[1:08:14] time it was in adam all that time
[1:08:17] amen the female part was there all the
[1:08:20] time
[1:08:20] amen god took it and he separated out of
[1:08:23] adam took the half out of him and
[1:08:25] created another half
[1:08:26] amen and the one became two amen
[1:08:30] and one and once there was two what
[1:08:32] happened adam wakes up
[1:08:33] and once there's two he joined them back
[1:08:35] together and it became one
[1:08:38] the one became two but then when he
[1:08:41] wakes up
[1:08:42] the two became one
[1:08:45] amen but then there one day there came a
[1:08:48] second adam
[1:08:51] amen now i think about it here is adam
[1:08:55] he finds out the eve coming he looks at
[1:08:58] her he says oh my this is now flesh of

[1:09:11] he loved her
[1:09:13] he cared for her he adored her
[1:09:16] she was the only one for him
[1:09:20] there wasn't another one there was no
[1:09:22] one else he could look at
[1:09:23] she was the only one for him that was
[1:09:26] his bride
[1:09:28] amen and when she fell into sin
[1:09:31] amen could he just go out and say lord i
[1:09:34] want you to get another feminine spirit
[1:09:36] out of me and
[1:09:38] i want you to get another rib out of me
[1:09:40] no he says lord
[1:09:41] i will redeem i will claim
[1:09:44] and he walked into sin the bible says
[1:09:48] knowingly he said the bible says that
[1:09:52] the woman was deceived in the
[1:09:53] transgression
[1:09:55] she didn't realize she didn't know and
[1:09:57] she was deceived into it
[1:09:59] but adam walked out willingly amen
[1:10:02] he had a choice shall i stay with god
[1:10:05] or do i walk out away out of the
[1:10:07] presence of god
[1:10:09] to be with my wife and he walked into
[1:10:12] sin
[1:10:12] knowing it was death to stay with his
[1:10:16] bride
[1:10:17] amen they were cast out of the presence
[1:10:19] of god cast out of eden
[1:10:21] amen lost their inheritance lost
[1:10:23] everything but he got to keep his bride
[1:10:27] but god said i will restore
[1:10:30] saith the lord on down through all the
[1:10:33] all the ages
[1:10:34] i will restore saith the lord because he
[1:10:37] had a slam
[1:10:38] the lamb that was slain before the
[1:10:39] foundation of the world they began
[1:10:41] testifying
[1:10:42] testifying abel began it abel showed the
[1:10:45] the the type of it when he slew the lamb

[1:10:51] the lamb they kept testifying
[1:10:53] there was a lamb slaying before the
[1:10:54] foundation of the world and all sudden
[1:10:56] one day

[1:11:02] our sins
[1:11:03] amen and god sent himself his spirit
[1:11:06] in the in a body of flesh called jesus
[1:11:09] christ
[1:11:10] sent him down to the earth amen the
[1:11:12] earth said we don't want him
[1:11:14] he sent himself to the earth and there
[1:11:17] said
[1:11:17] we don't want him and the earth put him
[1:11:19] back up in the heavens on the cross
[1:11:21] amen and what and what this was the
[1:11:23] second adam
[1:11:24] hey he came to claim the second bride
[1:11:28] who had fallen and sent amen as
[1:11:31] as the second adam was there crucified
[1:11:34] on the cross hanging between heaven and
[1:11:35] earth
[1:11:36] amen that roman soldier went up and
[1:11:38] pierced his side
[1:11:41] and out of his side flowed water
[1:11:45] and blood and then jesus cried into thy
[1:11:48] hands lord i commit my spirit
[1:11:52] the three things that came out of jesus
[1:11:54] on the cross is
[1:11:55] water blood and spirit and now those

[1:12:04] word amen we're cleansed by the blood of
[1:12:07] the lamb and then all of a sudden the
[1:12:09] life the spirit the holy spirit comes
[1:12:11] into your life
[1:12:12] it creates a bride
[1:12:16] of the second adam flesh of his flesh
[1:12:20] bone of his bone amen oh we're no longer
[1:12:23] a
[1:12:23] son and daughter of mr and mrs seer of
[1:12:26] mr mr oduday
[1:12:27] amen mr mrs sweaty mr and mrs smith
[1:12:30] we're no longer that but
[1:12:31] now the bible says we've been given
[1:12:33] power to become
[1:12:35] sons and daughters of god and let me
[1:12:37] tell you jesus christ
[1:12:38] he can't marry the human race amen he's
[1:12:41] gotta marry someone that has his spirit
[1:12:43] amen has his likeness his flesh of his
[1:12:46] flesh
[1:12:46] bone of his bone amen and so we have
[1:12:49] been transformed ephesian sets

[1:13:05] his bone we have been created now to be
[1:13:07] the bride of the lord jesus christ
[1:13:10] amen but don't take the name of the lord
[1:13:12] in vain
[1:13:13] let his life come down inside of you let
[1:13:16] his life
[1:13:17] transform you and don't give up until
[1:13:19] you see the difference
[1:13:21] amen what god has to do something oh
[1:13:24] they always talk about the evidence of
[1:13:26] the holy ghost is this
[1:13:27] the evidence of the holy ghost is that
[1:13:29] but let me tell you the evidence of the
[1:13:30] holy ghost is when god
[1:13:32] comes and does something for you that
[1:13:33] you cannot do yourself
[1:13:35] amen when god changes you into his
[1:13:37] likeness amen
[1:13:38] amen when you begin to accept the word
[1:13:40] for what it says
[1:13:42] when you say yes and amen to the word
[1:13:44] why because your
[1:13:45] word become one amen because he was the
[1:13:48] word and we are his bride
[1:13:50] that's when you begin to actually bear
[1:13:52] the fruits of the vine
[1:13:53] amen that's when he when he walks by as
[1:13:56] the husbandman
[1:13:57] walks up to the fig tree and he starts
[1:13:59] looking in the branches
[1:14:00] looking to see what's bearing in your
[1:14:02] life what is there a fruit here also he
[1:14:04] doesn't have to look far
[1:14:06] all right because oh there's fruit on
[1:14:07] this branch over here there's fruit on
[1:14:09] that branch over here there's fruit up
[1:14:10] at the top
[1:14:11] there's fruit at the bottom there's
[1:14:12] fruit all over why because you're living
[1:14:15] the life of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:17] amen but for the tree that was not
[1:14:19] bearing any fruit

[1:14:23] talked about life
[1:14:24] amen it's it's leave said i have life
[1:14:27] but it had nothing that could bring
[1:14:29] forth of its kind
[1:14:30] and god said let everything bring forth
[1:14:33] of its kind
[1:14:35] bring forth of its kind that's what
[1:14:36] genesis said let everything bring forth
[1:14:38] of its kind
[1:14:39] amen without the seed life the seed is
[1:14:42] in the fruit it's not in the leaves it's
[1:14:44] in the fruit amen
[1:14:45] and it's got to be something inside of
[1:14:47] you that brings forth something that
[1:14:48] looks like jesus christ
[1:14:50] so the seed that went into the earth in
[1:14:52] the beginning amen
[1:14:54] the seed that went into the tomb on

[1:22:18] just walked
[1:22:19] walked and walked and walked and all of
[1:22:22] a sudden
[1:22:22] one day he took a step on his walk and
[1:22:24] his step didn't hit the ground
[1:22:27] and he just began walking right up
[1:22:28] higher instead of taking the same old
[1:22:30] path

[1:22:50] his life is springing
[1:22:52] out of us we see the evidence of the
[1:22:54] holy ghost inside of us
[1:22:55] it's the evidence of the life of the
[1:22:57] lord jesus christ living his life
[1:22:59] through us

[1:23:02] earth again amen

[1:23:11] and when he is done building it he says
[1:23:14] well i'm going to dedicate this tip of
[1:23:15] the lord

[1:23:18] says this is a fine
[1:23:20] building nice stones

[1:23:32] good the structure is it's nothing until
[1:23:34] the presence of the lord came in
[1:23:36] and solomon just bowed his head and he
[1:23:38] began to pray
[1:23:39] and he said oh lord i pray father over
[1:23:42] this temple
[1:23:44] let this temple be known as a repository
[1:23:48] of the presence of jehovah let this
[1:23:51] temple be known
[1:23:52] that if anybody anywhere
[1:23:58] has a problem if their land is burdened

[1:24:28] comes
[1:24:28] to this land let him be a
[1:24:31] i am right or a hittite or anybody if he
[1:24:35] comes to this land

[1:24:38] jehovah and comes and offers a sacrifice
[1:24:40] at this house the house of the holy
[1:24:42] ghost

[1:33:44] halfway christian life

[1:33:49] says i should be
[1:33:50] and why did i start i didn't come to
[1:33:53] start halfway and not finish
[1:33:56] but i came to live this gospel out
[1:33:59] amen and like like a gideon said of old
[1:34:03] and he is living there in the promised
[1:34:06] land

[1:34:10] he was living in the promised land
[1:34:12] hiding from the enemy
[1:34:13] he would grow his crops and the enemy
[1:34:15] would come and steal
[1:34:18] and they would starve until the next
[1:34:20] season and they grow their crops and the
[1:34:21] enemy would come and
[1:34:22] through the land steal them again
[1:34:26] and one day as he was hiding his crops
[1:34:28] in a little building hoping that maybe
[1:34:30] he'd have just a little bit of food left
[1:34:32] for the year
