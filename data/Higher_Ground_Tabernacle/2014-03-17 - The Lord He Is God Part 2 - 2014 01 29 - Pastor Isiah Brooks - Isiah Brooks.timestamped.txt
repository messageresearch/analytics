[0:01] second Timothy 3:1 this know also that
[0:04] in the last days perilous times shall
[0:08] come Matthew
[0:15] 24:12 and because there excuse me and
[0:19] because iniquity shall abound the love
[0:22] of many shall
[0:26] wa pray father God we thank you for your
[0:31] gra thank you for your
[0:34] love thank you for
[0:36] being us You' been better to us Lord
[0:39] than we've been to
[0:41] ourselves father we just pray that you
[0:43] have your perfect will tonight Lord give
[0:46] us Grace Lord to instruct your people in
[0:49] the way that you would have them be
[0:50] instructed Lord as we submit ourselves
[0:53] to your
[1:07] SE Amen on last week uh Sunday we uh
[1:11] ministered on the thought the Lord is
[1:15] God and we we we showed by the grace of
[1:18] God that our shelter is in he is our
[1:21] shelter in time of need and I think our
[1:24] main uh thought uh or or theme if I was
[1:29] to say it like that would be breaking
[1:31] from under the pressure I showed you by
[1:35] the grace of God how that everything
[1:37] that is born has to come through
[1:39] pressure Born Under Pressure that right
[1:42] and uh we're going to show you by the
[1:44] grace of God that God always do things
[1:47] so
[1:49] unusual we're just going to take our
[1:51] time uh tonight because I really want
[1:54] you to get the thought on what we're
[1:56] saying um you know uh a brother called
[1:59] me the other day and he was giving me a
[2:01] thought real good thought and I thought
[2:03] oh that sound good but I'm not going to
[2:05] preach it but I will give you a taste of
[2:07] it just how often we say I don't care I
[2:13] don't
[2:14] care and you know I never saw how bad
[2:18] that statement or that uh uh is but you
[2:22] see he he took it from Genesis and he
[2:25] showed how and where that came from here
[2:30] was amen two brothers in the same church
[2:33] one brother killed the other one and
[2:35] then when Jesus or when God came to the
[2:37] brother said where is your brother he
[2:40] said I don't know and I don't care that
[2:44] was the spirit of uh my My Brother's
[2:48] Keeper and it begins to tell a story how
[2:52] that there was a a little mouse uh that
[2:55] was in this particular
[2:57] Farmhouse and uh this uh uh owner and
[3:01] his wife uh kept seeing the mouse uh uh
[3:04] and the mouse became a nuisance so the
[3:07] owner aen uh went out and bought a a
[3:10] mouse
[3:11] trrap and uh you know the mouse got a
[3:15] little excited ran out to the chicken
[3:18] and said chicken chicken help me help me
[3:21] the the M uh the Master of the House has
[3:23] bought a a a mouse trap she can said I
[3:26] know I'm part of the church here but I'm
[3:28] on the outside here
[3:30] you know that's not my problem what do I
[3:33] care and so he ran from the uh chickeny
[3:37] went over to the pig and said Pig I need
[3:40] you to help me here
[3:42] because the owner now has brought a
[3:45] mouth we got to do something about it
[3:47] and and the peach said you know I mean
[3:49] why do I care it ain't none of my
[3:52] problem amen I'm liking this and then so
[3:56] he he goes on and and he runs to the cow
[3:59] says God C come on you got to help me
[4:02] here because I know what this mean if we
[4:05] don't do something about this mouth trap
[4:08] I'll probably be the one that ends up in
[4:10] this predic can you help me because it
[4:13] move I'm out here in the
[4:16] field that is not concerning me why
[4:20] should I
[4:21] care well the saddest thing about the
[4:23] whole story is that one night the mouse
[4:27] trap was
[4:28] WR and and the wife of this man goes on
[4:32] and he he comes and and she comes and
[4:35] she not seeing it was in the dark but
[4:38] what had happened was a taale of a
[4:42] serpent sprung the Trap so when the
[4:46] woman went down to see the mouse in the
[4:49] Trap the serpent raised up and
[4:52] bitter well the farmer came by and he
[4:55] found out his wife was in critical
[4:58] condition and at that time when they
[5:00] found out other people the word went out
[5:03] so people came by and and and they said
[5:06] oh he said my himself you know with all
[5:09] these people I was expecting him to come
[5:11] I I might as well go prepare a
[5:15] chicken so he goes out and prepares the
[5:18] chicken and me for those that did come
[5:22] by and don't doubt amen the others the
[5:26] cow and the and the pig perhaps were
[5:28] still going about their business what do
[5:30] I
[5:31] care not knowing that the wife was going
[5:34] to die now the wife dies amen so now a
[5:38] bigger crowd comes by and the man think
[5:40] what I'm going to do with all these
[5:42] people let me go and prepare me a
[5:45] pig so he goes and he kills the pig
[5:48] right amen and so it it looked like it
[5:51] was all all said and done amen they have
[5:55] the funeral and now more people comes in
[5:57] the B say you know what I've got got to
[5:59] go Fe and prepare me a cow so he cooks
[6:03] the he kills a cow excuse me he kills
[6:08] the cow and then the the the thought
[6:11] behind it was this none of them would
[6:14] have lost their
[6:15] lives if they had only gone to help the
[6:20] mouse but often times people don't care
[6:24] and they fail to see whatever affects
[6:27] the body in a small way
[6:30] will eventually affect the body as a
[6:33] whole hello somebody that is why so many
[6:36] churches are there the spirit of God is
[6:39] grieved away because people saying in
[6:42] their spirit is not with their mouth
[6:45] what do I
[6:47] can't you see that the Antichrist Spirit
[6:50] behind
[6:51] it the same spirit that we say that that
[6:55] that we allow ourselves listen all of us
[6:58] should care yes not one of us amen
[7:01] should get to a place where you would
[7:04] let your brother or your sister just
[7:06] literally
[7:07] die without doing something about it
[7:10] even if it's just praying hear what I'm
[7:13] saying because that time people are in
[7:16] places you can't do nothing about it but
[7:18] one thing for certain the Church of the
[7:20] Living God can always pray amen yes you
[7:23] should always care your heart should
[7:26] always go out for individual come on
[7:28] somebody
[7:30] amen because the truth of the matter is
[7:34] you never know when you're going to be
[7:36] in that
[7:38] position right we'll let each other go
[7:41] through things in and out of things
[7:44] without even thinking about prayer comes
[7:46] up nobody thinks about
[7:48] calling it stops right
[7:51] here hello y'all hear what I'm saying
[7:55] you know and I'm sorry I meant to bring
[7:57] a prayer request for sister Andie at
[7:59] home not feeling well she text me and
[8:02] said pray for her I told her I bring
[8:03] before the church she's got to go to CH
[8:05] uh work tomorrow to open up she's the
[8:08] only one that's available so pray I pray
[8:11] you pray with me that God deliver her
[8:13] from that Spirit that's trying to affect
[8:15] her now let us move on by the grace of
[8:17] God I just wanted to give you some
[8:19] thoughts none of us should not care for
[8:23] each other
[8:24] amen Yes Y'all hear what I'm saying trth
[8:28] amen all always praying even if you
[8:30] can't contact get in contact with each
[8:32] other you should always try to remember
[8:35] each other in prayer it doesn't matter
[8:38] whether a person is walking right with
[8:40] God or not walking with right with God
[8:42] we're still Brothers yes we're still
[8:45] sisters come on somebody now let me move
[8:49] on by the grace of God I thought i' thw
[8:50] that with in because that was so good to
[8:52] me I had been you know a lot of times
[8:54] you don't say well I don't care what it
[8:55] is to me amen but I I know many many of
[8:58] us have used that term or that statement
[9:01] before but I want you to really think
[9:03] about it the next time you say that you
[9:06] know what I'm saying somebody I'm going
[9:08] to do what I want why should I care what
[9:10] they think about me I've been
[9:14] guilty but you should care cuz the Bible
[9:18] said a good name is better than
[9:22] gold hello y'all a got quiet on now but
[9:26] we are born under pressure there's no
[9:30] other way God can get to your go yes out
[9:33] of you and I but we must remember he is
[9:37] God
[9:40] Amen and I showed you by the grace of
[9:42] God in then in the scripture where it
[9:44] says that
[9:46] many love shall wax cold
[9:50] because iniquity shall abound iniquity
[9:52] is when they continually see people
[9:54] doing wrong and their love began to go
[9:57] cold yes but that individual and for
[10:01] others you why can they get away with it
[10:04] Hallelujah come on somebody but the
[10:07] point is amen it's not about that I said
[10:11] it like this a lot of times things
[10:13] offends us or things get to us and we
[10:15] don't make it right and all that is is
[10:17] the breath of the devil I said that last
[10:20] week it's the breath of
[10:22] Satan you don't have to confess it right
[10:25] now you don't have to you know let them
[10:28] know how you feel y'all hear I'm
[10:30] saying you don't have to
[10:33] forgive come on and the whole time he's
[10:36] cooling you off because that's what it
[10:38] said it means to cool as to breathe or
[10:41] to blow cool by blowing the breath of
[10:46] Satan is cooling you off and you wonder
[10:50] where your experiences has gone is
[10:52] because you have allow things to enter
[10:54] into your spirit Lord amen without
[10:57] making it right yes hello
[11:00] somebody now let me move on by the grace
[11:03] of God because Amen brother B goes on
[11:05] and talks about how Moses was born under
[11:07] pressure and under persecution just as
[11:09] they were killing all the babies in the
[11:12] time of Moses Jesus when he came they
[11:14] were killing all the babies to get them
[11:17] get him is that right now think about it
[11:20] the Royal seed was all has always been
[11:23] born under pressure amen hello so that
[11:27] means amen you and I
[11:29] we see a Jesus Christ really manifest
[11:34] itself through us when the pressure
[11:36] really
[11:37] comes now we're feeling some birth pain
[11:41] but it says amen when the devil went out
[11:44] to kill him kill Moses was killing
[11:48] children you see and what we fail to see
[11:51] is that the sque me tell us a lot of
[11:54] things but no doubt there'll be a lot of
[11:57] foolish in bad shap and bad
[12:01] trouble at the same time the Bride of
[12:04] Jesus Christ amen is standing strong
[12:07] amen yes Amen in Lamentations 55 says
[12:11] our Nets are under persecution we labor
[12:14] and have no rest what was it the reason
[12:18] why they were in Babylon the reason why
[12:21] Jeremiah could WR these things is
[12:23] because they were there because of their
[12:25] Disobedience yes amen y'all hear what
[12:27] I'm saying yes amen and listen people of
[12:30] God Amen if there's no rest in you every
[12:34] day is just confusion every day is just
[12:37] trials every day you almost out of your
[12:40] mind and then you need to go to the Rock
[12:43] yes there is a resting the Bible says to
[12:48] S me in the glass of the Rock Amen to
[12:52] the to the wrath of God is pass there is
[12:56] a place of Refuge
[12:59] 27 says hide me in that secret place
[13:03] underneath the stairs hide me in your
[13:06] provision for you excuse me is that
[13:09] right now listen there's something about
[13:13] the ride there's something about a true
[13:16] Christian because he realize he must go
[13:18] under the pressure he must go through
[13:20] trials he must suffer
[13:23] amen oh come on if you don't know that
[13:26] you going to be you suffer you you
[13:28] confused amen because first of all Jesus
[13:31] Christ said in order to to be his
[13:33] disciples you must first pick up your
[13:35] cross and follow me this is not a walk
[13:38] of
[13:39] ease and as Christians you and I must
[13:42] fight every day anybody in here to skip
[13:45] days to fight it's every day all day

[13:52] little breather in there somewhere but

[13:57] enemy is that right

[19:47] right but the whole point is he's trying
[19:50] to prove to you and remember a lot of

[20:01] we can walk with God and go through it

[27:14] better
[27:16] yourself if he gets any better treatment
[27:20] it's got to come from some other
[27:23] source he doesn't build himself a better
[27:25] house he doesn't make himself fry his
[27:28] meat where he used to eat it raw
[27:32] see it was to be done because there's
[27:35] nothing to him to give him a soul an
[27:38] animal doesn't have a soul but a man has
[27:40] a soul and therefore that soul is a part
[27:43] of
[27:45] God and even in his Fallen state yet is
[27:49] the most greatest species of all the
[27:51] species on the earth is the man and then
[27:55] get him in connection with his master
[27:58] Hallelujah he becomes a Superman
[28:05] almost because he is a Son of God Amen
[28:09] he becomes acquainted with his master
[28:12] with the creator of all things and then
[28:16] when the man there acquainted with his
[28:18] master become a part of his maker
[28:20] becomes back into the fellowship with
[28:22] his maker every here it is every Divine
[28:26] word becomes a living reality to him and

[55:36] talk about Jesus Christ but to tell them
[55:39] that God s a message to tell them that
[55:42] God in a
[55:43] prophet in such the age as this and they
[55:46] don't want to believe in prophets but
[55:48] they believe in the
[55:49] PO nobody says anything about the
[55:54] F even I got some some Protestant
[55:57] friends don't even want to believe what
[55:59] the f is now I'm thinking why would God
[56:03] let this man be called out of all the
[56:06] popes of History a pope could have been
[56:09] called in in brother Brown day super
[56:12] Pope why

[56:27] never been a PO that's been so popular
[56:31] ever where the Catholic and Protestants
[56:34] love this
[56:35] man is this the man and if it is when to
[56:41] see we know who he is where he's coming
[56:44] from everybody say he's coming from AF
[56:46] he's coming from this country and I read
[56:49] something in there where they said what
[56:50] I don't believe is the pop even I don't
[56:52] think he speak King I don't think the
[56:53] anti com don't what you

[1:07:33] name I want to say something to you that
[1:07:35] might sound a little strange but y'all
[1:07:38] we read about David all the time and we
[1:07:41] see the life of David was David life
[1:07:45] perfect was Abraham's life perfect you
[1:07:49] see I'm saying they made plenty of
[1:07:51] mistakes but it was all ordained of God
[1:07:55] now do you think God by mistake knew
[1:07:59] that Solomon was going to come from B
[1:08:01] Shea and he knew did you think God oh my
[1:08:05] I got to do something different
[1:08:06] regenerate something here now I'm not
[1:08:09] saying God made them do it but God knew
[1:08:11] what they were going to do by for
[1:08:14] knowledge and he could have easily stop
[1:08:16] David said David I'm making you King but
[1:08:19] up the road there going to be a Woman by
[1:08:20] the name of BBA don't go that way he
[1:08:23] could have done it but in seeing that
[1:08:26] God still had a purpose for that
[1:08:29] she
[1:08:31] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying I
[1:08:34] mean you look at Solomon and there was
[1:08:35] no greater King than Solomon even God he
[1:08:38] calls himself the son of
[1:08:40] David which was Solomon is that right
[1:08:43] and Solomon messed up so bad and not
[1:08:46] only that he ended up going into
[1:08:47] idolatry and everything some you know
[1:08:50] Solomon Solomon just lost where
[1:08:55] could never be
[1:08:57] lost no more than you could be lost amen
[1:09:00] if you were in the mind of God sa amen
[1:09:03] God uses his uses you for his own
[1:09:06] purpose that's why so many people will
[1:09:08] be in heaven who you thought wouldn't
[1:09:10] makeen cuz you didn't know amen that God
[1:09:13] purpose for that to be you said can't be
[1:09:16] brother let me tell you something one of
[1:09:18] the things that really caught my mind
