[24:47] sometime though we didn't interact but I
[24:50] saw him preaching amen so I kind of like
[24:54] an
[24:55] idea of his frame and his
[24:59] St more also he
[25:02] singing has always been a
[25:05] blessing we always told he's a singing
[25:10] pastor and I see he has
[25:13] maintained his role and his music is a
[25:17] real blessing we used to go from home to
[25:20] home hearing people listening to his
[25:24] music and we are so thankful about that
[25:29] so thankful also for our son there

[25:44] Chessa in in
[25:47] Zimbabwe and uh we came into the message
[25:51] also with his father when we were at

[25:59] and we're training to be
[26:01] teachers so happy to be able to reunite
[26:05] once again even with the Saints uh here
[26:10] also from various
[26:13] quarters we are so grateful for all that
[26:16] we have seen and all that we have heard
[26:18] and all that we have experienced ever
[26:21] since we arrived here and I would like
[26:24] to really thank the Lord for
[26:27] that uh uh he kept us well and
[26:30] comfortable and well entertained drove
[26:33] us around fed us we are most grateful
[26:36] for that you know when you are in a far
[26:40] away
[26:41] country just a little
[26:45] gesture will do you a lot of
[26:49] good and uh it's so good and it's so
[26:54] nice that we can be able to experience
[26:57] such also with you your pastor here
[27:00] which gives us a reflection of what
[27:01] maybe his church is
[27:04] like we bring you greetings also
[27:09] from Zimbabwe for those who knew who
[27:12] came and especially also from our church
[27:16] and our my wife who sending special
[27:19] regards also to you and part of the
[27:23] church maybe as we get ready to go into
[27:27] the way
[27:29] uh just uh for a short
[27:33] while I will just give a brief
[27:36] introduction like the Pastor
[27:39] said and
[27:41] uh my last born son Benjamin here is the
[27:47] one who came with me and escorted
[27:50] me as years as Roll by you need an
[27:54] assistant close by because you miss out
[27:57] on a lot of
[27:59] things like in the hotel where we
[28:01] staying sometimes I would want to go
[28:04] through the the the other door just
[28:07] where there is glass thinking that it's
[28:09] clear and he says no come through here
[28:12] so I'm so
[28:14] thankful they go very well along with
[28:18] Samuel they are AG mates and
[28:21] compatriots and uh so thankful that
[28:24] you'll be able to come with
[28:26] me uh my name is brother Denny
[28:32] matanga I am married to one
[28:38] wife
[28:40] um ever since about is 1998 or 1979 I'm
[28:47] not
[28:48] sure um I married to Lena
[28:52] matanga since yeah since
[28:56] 1979 and we are now 45 years into
[29:01] marriage and I would like to thank the
[29:03] Lord for the Blissful 45 years that he
[29:06] has given
[29:08] us and
[29:10] um I personally tend 69 in March I saw a
[29:15] lot of similarities with the pastor as
[29:17] we
[29:19] fellowshipping was it yesterday or the
[29:21] other day I attend 69 in
[29:24] March uh that is 2024
[29:28] and in my next birthday I'll turn
[29:32] 70 that's three score and 10 getting
[29:40] younger all the
[29:42] time people always wonder but why do you
[29:45] look younger and uh I said well it's
[29:48] because we are going towards the Rapture
[29:51] the
[29:51] renewal and the
[29:53] revamping of our
[29:56] bodies and uh
[29:59] um my wife also I think August 24 she
[30:03] tend 66
[30:06] years and uh we have seven children in
[30:11] our
[30:13] marriage one went to be with the
[30:17] Lord and now we have six children alive
[30:21] four boys and two
[30:23] girls and they are all married
[30:28] and through them we've been blessed with
[30:31] 17 grandchildren amen you see now the
[30:37] similarities
[30:39] um I believe God made it possible that I
[30:43] could also come and be able to meet our
[30:47] pastor there almost of the same age and
[30:51] uh when we're fellowshipping I could see
[30:53] there's lots of things that were lining
[30:56] up in terms of experience
[30:59] in terms of what we go through even as
[31:02] uh co-workers in the
[31:05] ministry and um I came into the message
[31:10] about
[31:12] 1978 that's about 46 years
[31:15] ago and um it's not been easy but
[31:21] somehow we' have made it to this
[31:26] day and um um that was when we were
[31:31] training as teachers at
[31:34] college and together with the father of
[31:38] Samuel and um I've been pastoring a
[31:42] church in Zimbabwe in a little town
[31:44] called rusape is between harar and
[31:48] mutari I've have been pastoring a church
[31:50] there since
[31:53] 1993 that's about 31 years now
[31:58] pastoring that
[32:00] church and
[32:02] obviously now after the
[32:05] late son is the last born Benjamin
[32:10] married also with two children you are
[32:12] now how many years old he's now 33 years
[32:17] old so it's such an
[32:21] experience and um quite a Time
[32:26] amen serving the
[32:29] lord in this message of the
[32:33] hour it's not a
[32:36] story but it's a
[32:39] reality many
[32:42] Waters have gone under the
[32:46] bridge eyes have
[32:49] seen many
[32:51] things some of which are still
[32:56] on but some of of
[32:58] which have come to
[33:01] note but I would like to thank God
[33:04] Hallelujah that his
[33:06] word is ever more so true
[33:10] amen I want to encourage you if you have
[33:13] believed this
[33:15] message you have not believed stories of
[33:18] cunning fables that's right but it's a
[33:22] living reality
[33:24] amenah God is so true yes God God is so
[33:29] real we see him we meet him we
[33:32] experience him every moment and every
[33:36] day of Our
[33:41] Lives you talk of the testimony of the
[33:44] reality of
[33:46] God it should be a day toay
[33:52] experience no matter how hard and how
[33:55] tough it becomes in your life and in
[33:58] your journey with God be rest
[34:02] assured that your God has not left you
[34:06] amen neither has he deserted you amen he
[34:10] is all the way with
[34:13] you till one
[34:16] day we hit that
[34:20] land that's how faithful he is and
[34:22] that's how true he is amen shall we pray
[34:28] blessed Lord Jesus we want to thank you
[34:30] this morning for this moment and time
[34:33] which is a privilege afforded Us by our
[34:37] precious pastor and Elder
[34:39] here that he could open his doors to us
[34:44] to come and stand and
[34:47] Minister Lord which is an opportunity we
[34:52] can never underr or
[34:55] underestimate many things
[34:58] happen many things fly
[35:02] around and Lord it would be so difficult
[35:06] for any
[35:08] minister to open up his
[35:10] Pulpit but Lord with this
[35:14] confidence that he has extended unto us
[35:17] it's a
[35:19] privilege we would never want to
[35:22] underestimate or underrate or
[35:25] abuse but profitably use it to the
[35:30] edification Lord of your
[35:33] bride father Lord
[35:36] Jesus many things we don't
[35:40] understand many things we cannot
[35:43] explain but Heaven holds the
[35:47] answer One of These Fine days when we
[35:50] cross
[35:51] over and we all lay at Jesus
[35:55] feet then we shall understand
[35:59] but part of the
[36:01] mystery is yet
[36:04] unfolding as we move along this
[36:07] journey I thank you Father for this
[36:10] Brethren of like Precious
[36:12] Faith men and women that you have
[36:16] called lord and they've given a Shepherd
[36:19] here our pre precious Pastor Isaiah
[36:22] Brooks Lord that they be fed and be LED
[36:26] under the hospice of the ministry that
[36:28] you have given him Lord
[36:32] because you have predestinated it like
[36:36] you predestinate the ministry of our
[36:38] Prophet brother William Marin Branham
[36:41] Lord and the people who were to move
[36:42] under his ministry a people who had to
[36:45] be called in this generation under the
[36:48] ministry that you gave him so likewise
[36:52] Lord it is I pray this morning Father
[36:57] that his eyes turned Lord May the
[37:00] anointing and the freshness of the holy
[37:03] spirit that which never
[37:06] fails that which is common in our midst
[37:11] father Undertake and make a way I know
[37:16] some of your children have got
[37:18] needs they have got
[37:20] desires some of them could be sick and
[37:24] Afflicted some of them Lord God Almighty
[37:26] could be so so low down but father I
[37:30] pray through the ministration of the
[37:32] word which no man can ever afford but
[37:36] God through his holy spirit you will
[37:39] achieve it in their hearts I commit
[37:41] myself to you I am only a man
[37:44] limited Lord God Almighty but we are
[37:46] looking at something Beyond
[37:49] Humanity God overtaking
[37:53] overriding lord Jesus all that we are
[37:56] but prod rejecting the purpose that he
[37:59] has had from before the foundation of
[38:01] the world I pray father and commit this
[38:05] time that we have together that it can
[38:09] be a blessing to us in Jesus Christ's
[38:11] name we pray amen and
[38:14] amen this morning by the grace of God
[38:17] would like to turn our
[38:20] Bibles to John chapter
[38:26] 14 and and um also Luke Chapter
[38:30] 5 John chapter 14:10
[38:34] reads believest thou not that I am in
[38:38] the
[38:40] father and the father in
[38:43] me the words that I speak unto you I
[38:46] speak not of
[38:48] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[38:51] me he doeth The
[38:55] Works Luke 52 to six and saw two sheeps
[39:00] standing by the lake that's Jesus but
[39:03] the fishermen were gone out of them and
[39:06] were washing their
[39:08] Nets and he entered into one of the
[39:10] ships which was
[39:12] Simon's and prayed him that he would
[39:15] Thrust out a little from the land and he
[39:19] sat down and taught the people out of
[39:23] the
[39:23] ship now when he had left speaking he
[39:26] said unto Simon launch out into the deep
[39:30] and let down your nets for a drought and
[39:33] Simon answering said unto him Master we
[39:37] have toiled all the
[39:39] night and when they had this done they
[39:43] enclosed a great multitude of fishes and
[39:47] their net
[39:50] break may God add blessings to the
[39:52] reading of his word as we take our seats
[40:01] this morning I would like to take this
[40:03] little message which I would like to
[40:06] title it's God the
[40:11] Father uh it's God the
[40:15] Creator in
[40:18] man God the Creator in man which is his
[40:25] church now amen amen that's from a
[40:30] quotation what is it all
[40:33] about in these end
[40:37] times what is it all
[40:41] about in Iowa dis Mo whatever what is it
[40:46] all about it's God the
[40:50] Creator in man amen which is his church
[40:56] now amen
[40:58] but his church it's
[41:00] you so it's God in you it's God in his
[41:05] church it's God in is in his bride yes
[41:09] that's the activity amen that's the
[41:13] season amen because we should be able to
[41:16] watch the seasons yes sir because as
[41:20] seasons change the symphony also
[41:25] changes as season change the order of
[41:29] events also
[41:31] [Music]
[41:32] changes like the service
[41:35] started with the pre- service maybe
[41:38] people were meditating coming into the
[41:41] song service coming into the pastor
[41:44] singing a special song the order of the
[41:48] service was changing with times and
[41:51] finally he calls upon the minister to
[41:54] come and Minister those are Chang
[41:57] changes is the order of the service
[42:00] changing so one should always be able to
[42:05] watch and see and observe the changes
[42:08] yeah so what am I saying this morning
[42:12] it's God the
[42:14] Creator in man yes which is his church
[42:20] now
[42:21] amen so the church is operating at a
[42:24] certain wavelength yes sir
[42:28] is operating in a certain
[42:32] season which it has got to know and be
[42:35] aware of yes sir
[42:39] lest many things pass on
[42:43] unnoticed and what you are looking for
[42:45] is already there or what you're hoping
[42:49] for God is already working in those
[42:52] Realms yes
[42:54] amen it's God God Amen the Creator yes
[42:58] in man which is his church now am
[43:03] Hallelujah and I have a little thought
[43:06] there which I end up with as my
[43:09] climax which I would like to
[43:12] say if it's not
[43:16] there we will put it
[43:22] there
[43:24] hallelujah amen
[43:27] H what is not there this
[43:30] morning if your healing is not there we
[43:34] will put it
[43:37] [Applause]
[43:42] there if your
[43:44] father that you have been crying
[43:47] for to come to the message your mother
[43:52] your child your relation if it's not
[43:55] there we will put it
[44:03] there that's why we read the text of
[44:06] Peter we have feish all
[44:11] nothing and we caught
[44:13] nothing and where there was
[44:17] nothing somebody came yes what am I
[44:21] saying this morning the scripture says
[44:25] he came into Peter's B and what am I
[44:28] saying it matters in whose
[44:32] B he comes into it is my prayer this
[44:36] morning
[44:37] Hallelujah that he comes into your Bo
[44:41] amen Jesus in your Bo will change the
[44:45] situation will change the
[44:49] circumstances will turn over the tables
[44:53] yes
[44:55] Lord all night
[44:58] efforts yielded
[45:02] nothing they deserted their
[45:05] BS wash their Nets Hallelujah put them
[45:09] somewhere
[45:11] there it was a total
[45:18] failure then Jesus
[45:21] came the game
[45:24] changer the game changer
[45:27] came Jesus he looks around he sees so
[45:33] many
[45:34] BS he sees the Nets that were already
[45:37] pegged up to go back home yeah somebody
[45:41] was giving up yeah somebody was saying
[45:44] this is the end of the journey but when
[45:47] the game changer came he had to
[45:51] Hallelujah he had to change
[45:54] situations Glory
[46:02] that's what he can do to you this
[46:03] morning he can turn around your
[46:06] condition turn around your situation
[46:09] regardless of what the doctor has told
[46:12] you he can change
[46:15] over it looks impossible but when the
[46:19] game changer comes there is a
[46:21] possibility
[46:28] he
[46:31] comes he
[46:34] comes Peter was so sad
[46:37] maybe maybe he had gone to the bank
[46:39] manager to get a
[46:42] loan so You' go with as many
[46:45] Nets like we saw yesterday when the
[46:47] pastor took us to the river of
[46:50] fishing and then he comes on his project
[46:54] proposal to the bank to the bank had
[46:56] said I'm going for this fishing trip I I
[46:59] hope to get so many tons so when I come
[47:02] with the yield out of the fishing I will
[47:05] pay half the loan but he caught nothing
[47:09] you can imagine what was going around
[47:11] him then Jesus came the game
[47:17] changer if there is
[47:21] nothing if it's not there we will put it
[47:26] there
[47:30] amen
[47:32] now what am I
[47:39] saying it's God the Creator in man which
[47:42] is in church now why we have so many
[47:45] problems many times is because we
[47:48] forget and Amnesia strikes we forget to
[47:52] know who we are we forget to know our
[47:54] Origins when a man knows his
[47:58] Origins then you can never never never
[48:02] dribble in any other way because he
[48:05] knows who he is he knows where he's
[48:07] standing he knows where he came from he
[48:10] knows where he's going back to amen
[48:13] hallelujah are we together
[48:16] amen that's why now what am I
[48:19] saying God made men in his own
[48:25] image and the man created in his own
[48:28] image was a spirit
[48:33] man
[48:34] amen and then after he got I'm quoting
[48:38] and then after he got all his creation
[48:43] made he
[48:45] said let us Prophet says
[48:49] plural let us I thought it was God who
[48:53] was he saying let us amen where were you
[48:58] when the Sons and Daughters of God
[49:00] shouted for Joy
[49:03] screamed where were you you and I as
[49:07] Sons and Daughters of God we were
[49:12] there we were there before Genesis 1
[49:19] verse1 when God said let there be amen
[49:23] we were before Genesis 1:1 amen we were
[49:27] there before time no wonder why brother
[49:31] say now let us take a trip back into the
[49:35] mind of God back into the mind of god
[49:39] let's go back to the archives of God
[49:42] what was there before Genesis 1:1 you
[49:47] were
[49:49] there so why are you
[49:51] worried about the things that's around
[49:54] you which were not there before Genesis
[49:58] 1:1 which were not there when you were
[50:01] in the mind of God that disease was not
[50:04] there that disease was not there that
[50:08] cancer was not there that sugar diabetes
[50:11] was not there that high blood pressure
[50:14] was not there that pain was not there
[50:18] that kidney problem was there was not
[50:20] there hallah who was there you were
[50:24] there in the mind of God
[50:27] when you get to know that then you can
[50:29] say devil where are you this morning
[50:33] tell me where you are Hallelujah you are
[50:35] not an equal with me I a child of God
[50:39] you can stand and say in the name of
[50:42] Jesus Christ I cast you
[50:45] [Applause]
[50:47] out what are we doing this morning we
[50:50] are paralyzing every
[50:52] unbelief we are giving the devil this
[50:54] place and you are taking OPP position as
[50:58] Sons and Daughters of God to
[51:02] know we were
[51:05] there before all what bothers us is
[51:10] there
[51:14] now let us plural make men in our own
[51:17] image we sons and daughter of God where
[51:20] there in our own image now if God is
[51:25] unseen want says you cannot see God and
[51:28] leave if the logos was in the
[51:31] form just mythically speaking drama in
[51:35] the form of a Hello then it's
[51:38] supernatural take note of that word
[51:40] hello amen so God is an object of
[51:45] worship but before God was God he was a
[51:49] great Fountain
[51:50] Spirit he was not created by anyone he
[51:54] was there because he wanted to be there
[51:56] before him was nothing he was that great
[51:59] founding spirit that covered the whole
[52:02] earth he was not God yet he became God
[52:06] when he created angels to worship Him
[52:10] are we together so we see right there
[52:13] and in that great Fountain Spirit there
[52:16] were attributes attributes to be a
[52:18] father attributes to be a redeemer
[52:21] attributes to be a savior attributes to
[52:24] be a Healer all that was in that great
[52:27] Fountain spirit amen do you see that my
[52:30] brother my
[52:32] sister and then out of
[52:35] him came out that light yes sir which
[52:40] was the logos that's right which was a
[52:42] chip off off the old block like I saw
[52:45] the picture of his son I said that's a
[52:47] chip off off off of the old block so you
[52:51] see so off came that which he says the
[52:55] scholars called the
[52:57] logos which was that light which was
[53:01] that
[53:02] Supernatural and then the prophet says
[53:05] right there God was becoming
[53:12] bized because a spirit has no body a
[53:15] spirit filth all places but now God was
[53:19] becoming
[53:21] bodyl and now in that state he could say
[53:25] let they be
[53:29] yeah
[53:31] Hallelujah oh brother I I get
[53:34] crazy I get crazy when you start to talk
[53:38] about those things brother I become five
[53:40] times taller than what I
[53:44] am hallelujah
[53:47] amen yes sir so you see that there he
[53:50] says if the logos was in the form just
[53:53] mythically speaking drama in the form of
[53:56] hell
[53:57] yeah then
[53:59] Supernatural you remember Moses saying I
[54:01] want to see God he says you can't see
[54:04] God in leave said but I ever go in the
[54:06] Clift of The Rock and Moses when he
[54:09] looked says what did you see says I saw
[54:11] something like the back parts of a man
[54:14] that's right in other words a form yes
[54:19] God being
[54:21] bized you cannot see a spirit Hallelujah
[54:24] it was now a form yeah
[54:27] now I want you to watch closely where we
[54:29] are going now so you can see your origin
[54:32] that the devil cannot bully you around
[54:34] now so he says uh the form then it's
[54:38] then he had to make a man in his own
[54:42] image so watch our
[54:46] Origins god making men in his own image
[54:50] now something that came out of him
[54:52] something that was a part of him that
[54:55] light that hello oh then he goes John 4
[54:58] says that God is a spirit and he had to
[55:01] make a spirit man and he brought it down
[55:03] now there is there is
[55:07] deity cannot be seen deity is the
[55:13] supernatural now are we together then he
[55:17] brings it down from a sacred
[55:22] hell to a little white cloud
[55:28] in other words it's part of that hello
[55:30] it's part of that logos it's part of
[55:33] that from that God then he brings it
[55:36] down a hello to a little white cloud
[55:40] something that's more
[55:43] visible that
[55:46] man do you see now your
[55:49] Origins that's man where did you come
[55:53] from Hallelujah I come from God and I go
[55:57] back to God that's Jesus and then the
[56:00] prophet says what what was he saying he
[56:02] was actually saying I come from becoming
[56:05] God and I go back to becoming God that's
[56:08] why after his Ascension then Paul comes
[56:12] he see him who are thou Lord he seen
[56:15] that pillar he seen that light and he
[56:18] recognized that was the
[56:21] Lord that's
[56:23] right are we together yes when you know
[56:27] your origin it gives you your position
[56:31] it gives you the authority it gives you
[56:34] the knowledge no one will just bully you
[56:37] around you know you're a a child of the
[56:41] father and the authority of the father
[56:44] is right there on your shoulders the
[56:47] authority of Heaven you have the epets
[56:50] of Heaven amen which shows the authority
[56:54] that when you say Satan oh
[56:56] he will Screech his
[56:58] bre and say I stop that's
[57:01] right are we
[57:04] together so do you see now from go from
[57:07] that great found Spirit comes the logos
[57:10] from that logos comes that white little
[57:12] Cloud I want you to be watching that
[57:15] because that white little Cloud now is
[57:18] now you God creating men in his own
[57:21] image that was a light and then you see
[57:24] This little light this little CL out do
[57:26] you see now so right
[57:29] there then when he did that now when men
[57:33] was now in that state in the image of
[57:36] God he had rulership and dominion over
[57:41] God's creation
[57:44] amen Adam I mean that he was told now to
[57:47] rule over it was when he was in that
[57:49] spiritual State Man created his own
[57:53] image in that state he would change the
[57:55] dire SE of the rivers Amen in that state
[57:58] he said Mountain from there to there are
[58:01] we clear he had the authority yes sir by
[58:06] virtue of his origin yes
[58:09] sir a child a son of the father is like
[58:14] the father are we together now Z says
[58:19] then he put men in the image of man on
[58:23] Earth so first man put in the image of
[58:27] God that was the spirit man then men put
[58:31] uh God putting men in the image of men
[58:33] on Earth amen that was now when man got
[58:37] this Earthly body amen are we together
[58:42] and he governed the Beast like the Holy
[58:45] Spirit leads the church today but there
[58:48] was no man to te the soil in the
[58:51] spiritual State he did that but now he
[58:53] discovered there was no man to K the
[58:55] soil then he put man in the image of man
[58:58] on
[58:59] earth created him out of the Dust of the
[59:02] earth dust Thou
[59:04] Art and unto dust shall thou return was
[59:08] not spoken unto the soul but unto this
[59:11] natural body that's
[59:13] right am because the soul did not come
[59:17] from the dust that's right when God
[59:19] created the Earth our bodies were laying
[59:23] in there and the procedure was going was
[59:26] going to call out our bodies amen
[59:29] because they were already there those 16
[59:31] elements out there but because of the
[59:34] four then we came the other way around
[59:37] that's why brother Bram was asked in the
[59:39] Millennium will they children be born he
[59:42] says not like he was going to be doing
[59:44] you will call them from the hallelujah
[59:48] amen amen you just called them from the
[59:52] earth amen those who will be dead gone
[59:55] you just called them amen are we
[59:57] together Hallelujah so we
[1:00:00] see that's where science gets mixed up
[1:00:03] they say no he might give me a hand like
[1:00:05] a mang he might give me a face like a
[1:00:08] chimpanzee he might give a foot like a
[1:00:10] bear but God put a soul in a man
[1:00:15] amen animals don't have souls but God
[1:00:20] put a soul in a
[1:00:23] man back home I was preachy preaching on
[1:00:26] the genetics or genetics of the natural
[1:00:30] life and the genetics of the spiritual
[1:00:31] life now let me drop something there
[1:00:36] what will I say so right
[1:00:40] there God put a soul in a
[1:00:43] man and brother Bram in his message he
[1:00:46] says the soul is the gene of life amen
[1:00:52] amen the soul is a gene of
[1:00:56] life so in other words when he put in
[1:00:58] there that was the gene of life because
[1:01:01] when he teaches about uh after the seral
[1:01:05] now I open teaching about the body the
[1:01:07] spirit and the Soul amen which was oppos
[1:01:11] the other side now he says now this has
[1:01:14] got five inlets the body five inlets the
[1:01:16] spirit and then also now the soul and
[1:01:19] the soul is the nature of the spirit
[1:01:21] that's right it's either God or Satan
[1:01:24] that's the influence amen amen that's
[1:01:26] right you see the point there that's
[1:01:28] right and so the soul he says is the Gen
[1:01:32] of
[1:01:34] life and he says that soul is the gene
[1:01:38] that come from
[1:01:40] God that soul is a gene that come from
[1:01:44] God did you see that that cloud there
[1:01:47] coming Hallelujah coming from that logos
[1:01:50] coming down right and it was that little
[1:01:53] Cloud there coming you see
[1:01:56] that's the gene of
[1:01:59] life then he moves on to
[1:02:01] say um your physical conducts the
[1:02:07] physical your spiritual conducts the
[1:02:10] spiritual but inside of that you've got
[1:02:13] a soul amen and that soul is that Gene
[1:02:17] that come from God from the message
[1:02:19] leadership he says the soul is that gen
[1:02:23] that come from God Amen now but to what
[1:02:26] we're saying there now this white
[1:02:30] cloud brother BR then says
[1:02:34] deity came
[1:02:36] down not in the
[1:02:39] animal in the man amen in other words it
[1:02:43] came in the soul is is the soul of the
[1:02:45] man It came it came now from God Amen
[1:02:49] that's right then here is this man and
[1:02:52] now the man sinned he says and when he
[1:02:56] sinned and fell that's why we lost our
[1:03:01] identity we lost our Bill of Rights we
[1:03:06] lost all that we were in the Garden of
[1:03:09] Eden and when men fell there was no more
[1:03:12] Fellowship that's why even the wanted to
[1:03:15] go after the men to kill him there was
[1:03:17] this Unity there was this fellowship
[1:03:20] with God Amen so then God be to work on
[1:03:23] a program of restoring the POS position
[1:03:26] of man to come back into
[1:03:29] Fellowship thank you Lord are we
[1:03:31] together so we see right here he says
[1:03:34] when he SE and fell then that little
[1:03:36] cloud in there become mad
[1:03:39] amen when men fell that little Cloud
[1:03:42] there he says it became mad and
[1:03:47] black that's
[1:03:49] right yet from God is that light that
[1:03:53] little cloud and when you follow the his
[1:03:56] messages he says now Satan chose to
[1:03:59] control from the mind but God chose to
[1:04:02] control from the heart he say the
[1:04:04] scientist first discovered in the heart
[1:04:07] there is a little portion there that's
[1:04:09] empty without any cell or anything
[1:04:12] that's where God stays that's where the
[1:04:15] soul is amen that's right so when men
[1:04:19] fail it mad yeah that little part that
[1:04:24] white cloud you see now yeah that's why
[1:04:27] now then by the way we came he says
[1:04:29] every man is born and she in
[1:04:33] iniquity that's right we come in a
[1:04:36] condemned Way by a condemned birth
[1:04:40] that's why you must be born again
[1:04:43] because the first birth is condemned by
[1:04:47] the way we came by the way of a man and
[1:04:50] a woman is condemned amen are we
[1:04:53] together it m a little Cloud it m that
[1:04:58] which came from God it m that which was
[1:05:02] a part but God to carry out a process
[1:05:06] which is guaranteed to restore you back
[1:05:10] to your
[1:05:11] position don't cry don't God has carried
[1:05:15] out a process am
[1:05:18] amen don't you says
[1:05:20] now so they became M and black then
[1:05:27] the
[1:05:28] logos came down you see from which that
[1:05:31] little Cloud came then the logos came
[1:05:35] down and was made
[1:05:38] flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this
[1:05:43] man back to the love of the
[1:05:47] father because of the Fall the White
[1:05:51] Cloud was
[1:05:53] mad then the logos that which came out
[1:05:56] of God that which was God came down and
[1:06:00] was made flesh that was now Jesus coming
[1:06:03] down being made flesh amen that's right
[1:06:06] he was now that Pillar of Fire in flesh
[1:06:09] amen like he said it in Solomon's
[1:06:12] Temple I mean the pillar of fire that
[1:06:15] led the children of Israel and then when
[1:06:17] Solomon built his Temple and then you
[1:06:19] saw that light that came he said the
[1:06:21] pillar of fire disappeared down there
[1:06:23] and it was never seen again until the
[1:06:26] days of Jesus Amen so now Jesus when he
[1:06:29] came he was that light in
[1:06:34] flesh thank you Lord that's why he say I
[1:06:37] come from God from becoming light amen
[1:06:39] and now I am that light in flesh but I
[1:06:42] go back to become again that God that
[1:06:45] light you see the supernatural sequence
[1:06:48] but this man now with this with this
[1:06:52] light with this white cloud it was mud
[1:06:55] in there and to correct that error he
[1:06:58] himself had to come down and be in a
[1:07:01] body of Flesh in order to redeem men in
[1:07:05] order to cleanse that part which was mad
[1:07:09] it needed a Kingman Redeemer and a
[1:07:11] Kingsman Redeemer was to be a man who
[1:07:15] was qualified what was the
[1:07:18] qualification to be
[1:07:21] willing he to have the
[1:07:24] credentials to have what it took in
[1:07:27] order to
[1:07:29] redeem you see the point there and also
[1:07:33] here to be a near Kinsman a near Kinsman
[1:07:36] somebody close to you God could not
[1:07:39] redeem us as a
[1:07:42] spirit he could not redeem us just as
[1:07:45] the
[1:07:45] logos but now he became flesh in order
[1:07:49] to be Kinsman to be a part of us to walk
[1:07:53] in a body to walk on the seashores of
[1:07:56] Galilee to go to capoun to go by that
[1:08:01] River or that pool to meet that
[1:08:04] woman to go by the grave of
[1:08:07] Lazarus here to identify with us in a
[1:08:11] body like ours in order to redeem us
[1:08:14] hallelujah because when man fell he fell
[1:08:18] in a body man never fail when he was in
[1:08:21] the state Spirit State that's right he
[1:08:24] never fail let us make own image he
[1:08:27] didn't fall in that state but when he
[1:08:29] was put in this body he fell that's why
[1:08:33] God had to create a body in the womb of
[1:08:39] Mary so that the Redeemer would come as
[1:08:42] a Kinsman in a body like ours to redeem
[1:08:46] a body identified with ours that fell to
[1:08:50] say Victory is
[1:08:53] certain Hallelujah no matter what the
[1:08:56] devil will say about your body will do
[1:09:00] in your body God has made a way for you
[1:09:04] don't be
[1:09:05] discouraged prise God Amen now so right
[1:09:10] there he
[1:09:13] came it say then the Loos came down and
[1:09:16] was made flesh dwelt among us to redeem
[1:09:18] this man back to the love of the of of
[1:09:20] the father and he came in by the baptis
[1:09:22] baptism of the Holy Spirit and Chas
[1:09:26] sin out of the human and brings men back
[1:09:30] again in fellowship with God you believe
[1:09:33] that he came by the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:35] Ghost to chase out sin where now let's
[1:09:40] identify
[1:09:42] now one point brother Bram says deity is
[1:09:45] in you now it's we don't over stretch it
[1:09:49] we take it in Balance he say deity is in
[1:09:51] you what is deity deity is God Amen and
[1:09:55] deity is the Divine status yeah the
[1:09:58] quality or nature the Creator the
[1:10:02] creator has the Supreme Being and now
[1:10:05] with this I go to this quotation that's
[1:10:07] what's the matter with the Pentecostal
[1:10:10] people
[1:10:12] yes they don't recognize who they are
[1:10:17] that's
[1:10:17] right your sons and daughters of God
[1:10:21] your sons and daughters of God comes by
[1:10:24] that revelation of the word you have
[1:10:28] received amen
[1:10:30] amen now Revelation is Progressive from
[1:10:34] justification sanctification coming to
[1:10:36] the baptism of the Holy Spirit we don't
[1:10:38] remain on the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:40] and the restoration of the gifts we move
[1:10:42] further to the revelation of the
[1:10:45] fullness of the word all this is a part
[1:10:48] of it like brother Bram had that first
[1:10:51] pool he had the second pool and coming
[1:10:53] to the third pool amen at one point one
[1:10:56] juncture he says I no longer look back
[1:10:59] to the use of the hand look back to
[1:11:01] discernment but I just believe that God
[1:11:04] says it in his word just pray and move
[1:11:07] forward but sometimes also yes we may go
[1:11:11] back here and there but our emphasis is
[1:11:13] no longer there we are moving on like
[1:11:17] you see with a plant the life is moving
[1:11:19] up through the roots to the stock to the
[1:11:23] to the tassel right to the shark right
[1:11:26] into the seed all that was moving
[1:11:29] through all this is now in the seed the
[1:11:33] seed has become seed
[1:11:37] again do you see that my my sister
[1:11:39] Hallelujah so right
[1:11:41] there you will see that Revelation is
[1:11:45] Progressive we don't remain static we
[1:11:49] move on that's why Paul says now let us
[1:11:52] now move on unto Perfection yes sir amen
[1:11:55] let us move onto perfection in other
[1:11:57] words it's a journey to move to
[1:12:00] Perfection there is certain things that
[1:12:02] we've got to leave he says leaving all
[1:12:05] these other doctrines all these of them
[1:12:08] baptisms all them of them laying on of
[1:12:11] hands he's not discarding them but
[1:12:14] leaving them we've been too long on this
[1:12:16] mountain in other words let us stand the
[1:12:20] northward let us make
[1:12:22] progress it says but if you need be here
[1:12:25] and there we can always also come back
[1:12:29] to that but really that's not our major
[1:12:32] emphasis our major emphasis to move
[1:12:35] towards
[1:12:37] Perfection and how do you move towards
[1:12:40] Perfection is
[1:12:43] knowing where you came
[1:12:46] from who you are and where you are going
[1:12:50] back to am yes
[1:12:52] sir amen and that's Amnesia that the
[1:12:56] devil is tricken the world with to
[1:12:58] completely erase to know who you are and
[1:13:01] you have come from because when you know
[1:13:03] where you have come from you are not
[1:13:04] bothered by so many of these things you
[1:13:06] know I'm a child of the
[1:13:09] father Benjamin they won't be bothered
[1:13:12] he knows this is my
[1:13:14] father he looks at his
[1:13:17] forehead look at that forehead look at
[1:13:20] this big head he looks at that looks at
[1:13:23] he he knows what he came from amen he
[1:13:27] knows where he goes back to amen so we
[1:13:30] don't lose identity when we come in this
[1:13:33] world that the essence of this message
[1:13:36] of restoration is to remind us and to
[1:13:40] polish us to realize who we are we come
[1:13:44] from God and we go back to God a child
[1:13:48] of the father is a child of the father
[1:13:51] no matter what
[1:13:52] happens the prodical son
[1:13:56] was a child of the
[1:13:58] father but he decided some point to
[1:14:00] leave the father to go yeah you know I
[1:14:05] was bringing something one time and then
[1:14:06] you see the prophet says the Covenant
[1:14:09] still
[1:14:10] holds if you are a child if you are a
[1:14:13] son whatever you do it doesn't remove
[1:14:17] your sunship but you might lose certain
[1:14:21] privileges but the fact that you're a
[1:14:24] child of the matang or the chess or the
[1:14:28] Brooks you remain the Brooks because
[1:14:31] you've got a nose of the Brooks you've
[1:14:33] got the eye of the Brooks you've got a
[1:14:36] leg of the Brooks you don't lose your
[1:14:38] identity you might lose out on some
[1:14:41] privileges but you remain a child of the
[1:14:46] father that's why the prodal son
[1:14:49] Hallelujah out there now he was eating
[1:14:52] with pigs amen that's right lost
[1:14:55] privilege of eating at the king's table
[1:14:59] am he was now friends who were
[1:15:02] Wayward he had no good clothes he was in
[1:15:06] the rags amen he lost those
[1:15:09] privilege all the same he was still a
[1:15:12] child of the
[1:15:14] father and one day he remembered there
[1:15:18] is a father somewhere I've got a father
[1:15:22] Over Yonder I've got a father
[1:15:27] it doesn't matter how much of sin you
[1:15:29] are into hallelujah how much of a you
[1:15:32] have become but you are still as child
[1:15:34] of the
[1:15:36] father one day
[1:15:38] remembered and the scripture tells us
[1:15:40] that each day the father would always go
[1:15:43] up to was and say when will my son come
[1:15:47] back when you go high when will my son
[1:15:51] come back because the Deep cth unto the
[1:15:54] Deep
[1:15:56] and one day the son says no I'm sick and
[1:15:59] tired of not of not living in my
[1:16:02] father's domain and privileges I will go
[1:16:05] back home when I go back home I will be
[1:16:10] restored behold I sent you Elijah to
[1:16:14] restore you back to your father's domain
[1:16:19] to restore you back to a
[1:16:22] position where again you can
[1:16:25] nature and say storm in 5 minutes time
[1:16:30] give
[1:16:31] way where you can say again there are no
[1:16:35] squirel but let there be
[1:16:38] squirels back again in the domain of the
[1:16:42] father through the message of
[1:16:45] restoration
[1:16:47] restoration is not
[1:16:49] replacement but it's taking something
[1:16:51] that's Fallen the real same thing you
[1:16:55] take it back to where it was and what am
[1:16:59] I saying my brother somebody who is
[1:17:02] Fallen this morning it might be a loved

[1:18:34] Jesus we are paralyzing the
[1:18:37] devil we are paralyzing the devil we are
[1:18:40] inflicting the devil we are Sons and
[1:18:43] Daughters of God restored to our
[1:18:46] position and we are flexing our
[1:18:49] musles saying Satan this is a noo area
[1:18:54] come out of this room we want to
[1:18:57] experience uh the movement of the Holy
[1:19:00] Ghost we want to experience the baptism
[1:19:04] of the Holy Ghost why
[1:19:07] because we come from God we were a part
[1:19:11] of God and we go back to be us just say
[1:19:16] Amen somebody say hallelujah
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:32] so he says that's the matter of the
[1:19:34] Pentecost they don't realize they don't
[1:19:38] recognize but he says but you are Sons
[1:19:40] and Daughters of God now
[1:19:43] recognition comes by the
[1:19:46] revelation of the word you have
[1:19:49] received I have heard but now I see you
[1:19:54] have had the message but now you see
[1:19:57] that seeing is the Revelation it comes
[1:20:00] by the
[1:20:01] word it comes by the truth that God has
[1:20:05] revealed in your Edge now so deity
[1:20:08] dwells in man says the prophet look
[1:20:11] deity I'm a part of Charles
[1:20:13] Branham I'll just take it ASV I can take
[1:20:16] it and just cut off when our time comes
[1:20:19] now look I'm a part of Charles Branham
[1:20:23] because I was born from Charlie Bram
[1:20:26] my daddy I am a part of him I have got a
[1:20:30] forehead like
[1:20:32] him my hair was like him I'm a small man
[1:20:37] like
[1:20:38] him I am in the nature like him because
[1:20:43] he is my
[1:20:45] dad now now when you come to that now
[1:20:48] you go to
[1:20:50] genetics now what is
[1:20:52] genetics is the study of genes
[1:20:57] brother brah refers to this as speaks I
[1:20:59] think Paradox about that boy who had
[1:21:02] done something to a girl and the parents
[1:21:04] were worried that he couldn't say sorry
[1:21:07] said but he's a nice boy he's like this
[1:21:09] then brother branam in answering them
[1:21:13] yes he goes to the
[1:21:16] genetics right of the family that's
[1:21:19] right that's where his answer was he
[1:21:22] says the Gans of the father and the
[1:21:26] jeans of the mother were inter breed
[1:21:31] into
[1:21:33] him then he picks also from the mother's
[1:21:35] line says look at how the sisters of the
[1:21:37] mother behave you can greet them they
[1:21:40] just they don't stand up to say okay say
[1:21:45] go and he explains that he says you look
[1:21:48] the brothers of your fathers they're
[1:21:50] always fighting and quarreling and is
[1:21:52] it's it's in their line that's right he
[1:21:54] said but as for you brother the father
[1:21:57] and the mother you no longer do that
[1:21:59] because you received the baptism of the
[1:22:01] Holy Ghost amen and he says this boy no
[1:22:07] matter how good he looks he should
[1:22:08] receive the holy spirit because if he
[1:22:11] doesn't if he gets married like that he
[1:22:13] will cause hell that's what he am yes
[1:22:16] sir now that's now speaking about the
[1:22:19] natural
[1:22:21] genetics which highly influences Our
[1:22:24] Lives
[1:22:26] the natural genes of the father being
[1:22:28] interpret to us but now we go also to
[1:22:32] the spiritual
[1:22:33] genetics of our origin where did we come
[1:22:37] from that's why we started where we
[1:22:39] started we started from God we started
[1:22:42] as a part of where were you we were a
[1:22:44] part of God Amen so if we a part of God
[1:22:47] it means like we saw ending up with a
[1:22:50] soul that is the gene from God we are a
[1:22:53] part of God so we are an expression of
[1:22:55] what was in him so our spiritual
[1:22:58] genetics are that that's why now we
[1:23:00] speak of ourselves as sons of and
[1:23:02] Daughters of Abraham by faith it's a
[1:23:05] spiritual Gene am moving down that line
[1:23:08] amen so when you talk of those genes
[1:23:11] genes actually carry information yes sir
[1:23:14] that gets passed from one generation to
[1:23:17] the
[1:23:18] next why one child has blonde hair like
[1:23:23] their mother while their sibling has
[1:23:25] brown hair like their father is because
[1:23:28] of the
[1:23:30] jeans so many times what we are is not
[1:23:33] of our own making it's not of our own
[1:23:35] choice but it's by the jeans amen and
[1:23:37] you see now when you go to the
[1:23:39] spiritual much of what you
[1:23:42] become or what much of what you will be
[1:23:45] is not by choice is by what your
[1:23:48] spiritual gen
[1:23:50] are no wonder why he says now this
[1:23:53] promise
[1:23:55] of the spiritual gen is unto you and
[1:23:59] your children and them that shall come
[1:24:03] from Far thereafter amen it was looking
[1:24:06] at not looking so much at family line
[1:24:09] but it was looking at a line of the
[1:24:11] spirituality how that gen moves through
[1:24:14] that yes sir yes
[1:24:18] sir now if we become in spirit sons of
[1:24:22] God de in the man Hallelujah then you
[1:24:26] talk about blind eyes being
[1:24:30] open in other words spiritual GS of the
[1:24:32] father are in breed into us have you
[1:24:37] ever noticed sometimes you wonder why
[1:24:39] you ever came in this message how is
[1:24:42] history why you cannot explain sometimes
[1:24:45] you feel I'm done with this message I
[1:24:48] leave it maybe change States but you go
[1:24:50] to another state you catch up with it
[1:24:55] sometimes know today I'm not going to
[1:24:57] church I'm not going to church but
[1:24:59] somehow maybe 30 minutes before I have
[1:25:02] to go it's the jeans that are
[1:25:06] controlling
[1:25:08] you it's actually in your DNA says that
[1:25:12] DNA it's a
[1:25:14] chemical which is in the in the cells
[1:25:17] yes right which is in there which is the
[1:25:20] properties yes sir of who you are am
[1:25:23] what Mak makes you the being that you
[1:25:26] are what makes a fish what it is amen
[1:25:29] DNA amen so we have the DNA of God and
[1:25:35] brother Brown I mean it's referred to
[1:25:38] now when you speak of DNA it's referred
[1:25:39] to as the normally when they describe
[1:25:42] they refer to it as the as the know the
[1:25:45] template you know the master plan the
[1:25:47] the the
[1:25:49] plan like Moses was given the plan yes
[1:25:52] to implement your own Earth he says
[1:25:54] that's what the DNA is so if youve got a
[1:25:57] plan if you change it you miss the mark
[1:26:00] But build whatever you're building
[1:26:02] according to plan that's right so you
[1:26:04] are what you are according to the DNA of
[1:26:07] God that's in you to be a
[1:26:11] Christian even if you want to backslide
[1:26:13] I can assure you my brother you can
[1:26:16] backslide in your mind but you'll never
[1:26:18] be able to achieve it because it's not
[1:26:21] in your
[1:26:22] DNA have you ever chosen to speak the
[1:26:25] way you speak did you ever choose to
[1:26:28] smile the way you smile even the men
[1:26:30] sometime the step you have people can
[1:26:33] say but his dad used to to move like
[1:26:36] that his mother was like that it's all
[1:26:39] in the G amen so our spiritual gen
[1:26:43] influence us that's right no wonder why
[1:26:46] you
[1:26:47] see
[1:26:48] that there is a man in the
[1:26:51] Bible we see there when uh actually he
[1:26:55] paid
[1:26:56] ties to meaz EDC that's
[1:27:00] right he paid ties Abraham he paid
[1:27:03] ties he just seen what happen said this
[1:27:06] man is worth receiving by Revelation
[1:27:08] then he paid those ties and now after he
[1:27:11] paid ties because it was in his
[1:27:13] spiritual gen yeah fourth generation
[1:27:17] comes
[1:27:19] Levi the Bible then begins to say Levi
[1:27:22] paid TI when he was in the
[1:27:27] loins of his
[1:27:29] father that was before he was L was
[1:27:33] manifested four generations later and
[1:27:35] when lii comes up he says now we are
[1:27:37] worthy to receive tithes of your
[1:27:39] brothers because you paid ties when you
[1:27:42] were in the loins of your father you see
[1:27:46] that line of spiritual gin just coming
[1:27:51] down you go to Timothy yeah you go to
[1:27:54] the mother what was
[1:27:58] it that gift of faith yes sir prayer
[1:28:02] Warrior you go to the grandmother Unice
[1:28:06] Sam Sam it it runs like that so when you
[1:28:09] speak about those spiritual genes you
[1:28:13] are speaking about what God made you
[1:28:16] before the foundation of the world and
[1:28:19] then he wrote your name in the Lamb's
[1:28:22] Book of Life not the book of life but
[1:28:25] the Lamb's Book of Life and that name
[1:28:28] cannot be
[1:28:29] erased because way in the mind of God
[1:28:32] when he saw all the mishaps he was the
[1:28:35] lamb slain in the mind of God and he
[1:28:39] wrot your name by his blood and no one
[1:28:42] can erase
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:44] it you see that spiritual Gene
[1:28:47] am now honestly believing the message if
[1:28:51] it was by choice no one would believe it
[1:28:55] if it was by choice no
[1:28:57] one no one everyone wants a life is a
[1:29:00] bit easy and loose and you can your
[1:29:03] things but the message sometimes it's
[1:29:05] got a line to follow but it's because of
[1:29:09] the Gans amen the Gen amen you don't
[1:29:12] choose the type of nose you don't choose
[1:29:15] the type of laughter but it it go with
[1:29:18] the jeans you see that right so it goes
[1:29:22] out said it says now the right there
[1:29:25] um now let me leave some of these
[1:29:29] things now so the very God that stood
[1:29:32] back there on the mythical platform of
[1:29:35] the eternities and rolled worlds off of
[1:29:38] his hands and created these things give
[1:29:40] you the privilege to be his son it's a
[1:29:42] privilege to be his son and you a part
[1:29:45] of him and God dwells in mankind and man
[1:29:48] himself is deity amen that's right
[1:29:51] Hallelujah there you are it might chalk
[1:29:54] you but stud over that a little
[1:29:58] while God dwells in man and man becomes
[1:30:01] a Son of God not him in himself but the
[1:30:04] Holy Spirit that's in him is God the
[1:30:07] Creator lives in the creation oh my how
[1:30:10] I think of that then stand with an
[1:30:12] unweaving faith and ask what you will it
[1:30:17] will be done unto you there is God there
[1:30:20] is by virtue of you being a son of God
[1:30:24] by virtue of the holy spirit being in
[1:30:26] You by virtue of being the Creator
[1:30:30] living in you then you can ask what you
[1:30:33] will amen and it will be done unto you
[1:30:36] there is God there he is in other words
[1:30:40] Emmanuel was God With Us the Lord Jesus
[1:30:43] with us now that was God on Earth the
[1:30:47] bible say that he shall be called
[1:30:49] Emmanuel which is interpret God With Us
[1:30:51] is that right now there is God a
[1:30:54] descending of God coming down now he is
[1:30:58] in the form of men now watch is just a
[1:31:02] little closer to man God Among Us
[1:31:06] Emanuel Hallelujah and he gave his blood
[1:31:09] to cleans the heart now do you see that
[1:31:12] white cloud that was mad he gave his
[1:31:15] blood to cleanse the heart of sexual
[1:31:19] born men and woman amen amen am you see
[1:31:24] he gave his blood that was not human
[1:31:26] blood that was God's own blood God
[1:31:29] created a blood cell in the womb of Mary
[1:31:34] right Mary was only an incubator and
[1:31:37] that blood cell is what was going to do
[1:31:40] it Hallelujah to to to to change the
[1:31:44] Dynamics of what the devil had done in
[1:31:46] the human race to return and restore man
[1:31:51] back to his stance that stance that God
[1:31:54] wanted God meant to be like Amen in his
[1:31:58] own image so now here to give the blood
[1:32:01] which was UN adultery blood not by sex
[1:32:05] but virgin born and he gave that blood
[1:32:09] to cleanse the heart of sexual born man
[1:32:13] and woman you and I and he cleansed us
[1:32:16] from our sins that God himself might
[1:32:19] come in the third person now and live in
[1:32:22] the human heart you see that cloud White
[1:32:26] Cloud says it was in the heart there it
[1:32:29] was mad so he could come and live in the
[1:32:31] human heart God so in love with his
[1:32:33] creatures when I think of that my heart
[1:32:36] melts and that Jehovah God that created
[1:32:39] all those things brought himself down to
[1:32:41] live in the heart of you and I before he
[1:32:44] did he had to clean his Rod he had to
[1:32:47] show them law and commandment then he
[1:32:49] had to come down and show them love and
[1:32:51] then break his way right into the heart
[1:32:53] of man and now God is in us that's right
[1:32:58] in other words on the cross of Calvary
[1:33:00] the law brought judgment am right and it
[1:33:06] nailed him on the cross for your sin and
[1:33:08] my sin you was caring and on the other
[1:33:11] arm it extended grace even to that man
[1:33:16] who was on the cross and the rest of us
[1:33:19] so that judgment while it was judging
[1:33:22] the sin upon him it was ushering in the
[1:33:25] grace of God unto us through his son
[1:33:28] amen now we are his hands on Earth we
[1:33:32] are his eyes we are his gospel on earth
[1:33:36] oh we are his eyes we are his hands we
[1:33:39] are his gospels amen we are his gospel
[1:33:42] why we written we we are written
[1:33:44] Epistles read of all men the gospel come
[1:33:47] not in word only but through the power
[1:33:49] and demonstr of the spirit go out in the
[1:33:52] world and preach and demonstrate and all
[1:33:54] that so Christ is the mystery this is
[1:33:57] God's great mystery of Love Express that
[1:34:01] God and man become one amen that's where
[1:34:06] our issue is the whole thing is God and
[1:34:09] man one God and man was one there look
[1:34:14] in the beginning it was God and man one
[1:34:16] and God and man one here remember when
[1:34:19] Christ came God again uniting that he
[1:34:23] might be in Christ and Christ in us and
[1:34:26] all of us together one the Holy Spirit
[1:34:28] same thing it revealed it to Christ
[1:34:30] reveals it here the supernatural
[1:34:33] creative power that's what I'm looking
[1:34:35] at the supernatural creative power amen
[1:34:39] which if something is not
[1:34:42] there you put it there amen by the
[1:34:46] supernatural creative power let they be
[1:34:50] light
[1:34:52] Hallelujah and they was
[1:34:55] light let this and that happen and there
[1:34:58] the supernatural creative power so the
[1:35:01] same God that could say that to Moses
[1:35:04] let there come frogs the same one who
[1:35:07] would send up let this water be turned
[1:35:09] into
[1:35:10] wine hallelujah amen he is the same God
[1:35:15] the same one let me say who said what do
[1:35:19] you want and he says I want some
[1:35:22] squirrels in other words Let There Be
[1:35:25] squs
[1:35:27] amen Moses Jesus Christ and in our day
[1:35:32] amen that's right and that's the
[1:35:35] challenge and the level to which the
[1:35:38] message is taking us to to where we are
[1:35:41] restored back to our stance as Sons and
[1:35:44] Daughters of God Amen now to use the
[1:35:48] spoken word creative
[1:35:50] power for the spoken word is the
[1:35:54] Original Seed that's right that's it we
[1:35:58] have to we have to agree that's why
[1:36:00] preachers will say it over and over
[1:36:02] until one day you will catch
[1:36:05] it so he
[1:36:08] says I mean God wrot the word and he
[1:36:10] manifests it through men he just don't
[1:36:13] change it's God in man that's his
[1:36:16] manifestation that's what he was
[1:36:18] revealing revealing that's what he's
[1:36:20] trying to do and God's Own word Reve
[1:36:22] shows that men cannot create God is the
[1:36:25] Creator and it ain't man no
[1:36:29] more it's God the Creator in man which
[1:36:33] is his church
[1:36:36] now it's God the Creator in man which is
[1:36:39] his church now God and man have become
[1:36:43] one why because Christ was both human
[1:36:46] and
[1:36:47] divine so you have that portion of God
[1:36:49] in you in a measure to exercise that you
[1:36:53] see that my brother my sister then I
[1:36:56] move on I'm going to my issue now so he
[1:37:02] says the word will be
[1:37:05] spoken and it will create
[1:37:08] itself right
[1:37:11] there he him blessing of a son taking
[1:37:15] out him out into a certain place have a
[1:37:17] ceremony before angels and place him
[1:37:20] positionally and what he is in the body
[1:37:22] of Christ then that person has the
[1:37:24] authority let me say this if you count
[1:37:27] me a fanatic from this time night on
[1:37:29] that very same thing that I'm speaking
[1:37:31] of will be done there will be a power
[1:37:34] put into the church and now he coming in
[1:37:37] that the Holy Spirit Will so annoint the
[1:37:40] people they will speak the word and it
[1:37:42] will create itself right there you will
[1:37:46] speak the word and the word you will
[1:37:49] speak has got the power to go and create
[1:37:52] itself
[1:37:54] right
[1:37:57] there you believe
[1:38:00] it do you believe it
[1:38:03] amen it will they will speak the word
[1:38:05] and it will create itself we haven't
[1:38:07] seen Powers like that coming to the
[1:38:09] church I know for a fact right say unto
[1:38:12] this mountain be moved don't doubt in
[1:38:14] your heart the placing of the church in
[1:38:17] position where the fullness of the power
[1:38:19] of the Holy Ghost comes with then
[1:38:20] critics mouth will be shut it will be a
[1:38:22] short time Jesus come right over the
[1:38:24] mountain now so in this case now what
[1:38:26] are we seeing adoption adoption is
[1:38:29] placing that's sons taking their
[1:38:32] position strategically each one in his
[1:38:34] position like God is adopting in his
[1:38:36] church those are the arms of the church
[1:38:39] The Arms Of God God using them and that
[1:38:43] adoption uh gives you the authority it
[1:38:46] gives you the power it's not you the
[1:38:50] prophet says it's the Holy Ghost In You
[1:38:53] amen
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:55] amen is the holy spirit in you you're
[1:38:58] only a vessel bring yourself to Total
[1:39:01] subjection amen and then he can use you
[1:39:06] amen amen you yield and God uses you am
[1:39:13] do you believe
[1:39:14] that many challenges we are receiving in
[1:39:16] our lives God is calling us to
[1:39:19] action he's calling us to action
[1:39:23] when you put in a corner then it will
[1:39:27] make you act it will make you act along
[1:39:30] the lines of the scripture in the word
[1:39:32] so you see right there it says now that
[1:39:36] word will be spoken and it will go to
[1:39:39] create its own self
[1:39:43] Amen Let There Be and there was amen

[1:42:49] we just uh keep him two days or so while
[1:42:52] we right notes on how you can best keep
[1:42:54] him I said Doctor I agree with you as a
[1:42:59] physician but I believe amen while you
[1:43:02] are attending for these two days we'll
[1:43:04] be praying for where you end that's
[1:43:07] where our God starts he say he says Miss
[1:43:10] matanga I want to tell you I'm a
[1:43:11] physician last week I told another one
[1:43:14] coming from that place called ching and
[1:43:16] he's dead now your brothers I said yes
[1:43:21] so we went home and I got day my mother
[1:43:24] and my sister were crying I said don't
[1:43:26] why I
[1:43:27] cry God in this day raised the prophet
[1:43:31] and he said this Prophet not cancer will
[1:43:34] stand before you and I
[1:43:37] believe that same God is able to do it
[1:43:42] after two days the doctor said no we
[1:43:44] want to keep him still a little longer
[1:43:46] after a week two he says Miss matanga
[1:43:49] there is a faint distant change but
[1:43:51] nothing to worry about don't don't even
[1:43:53] been encouraged I said Doctor I know
[1:43:56] what you're saying our God has already
[1:43:59] begun to
[1:44:00] work he says but is not to encourage you
[1:44:03] please don't the man is sick I said yes
[1:44:06] surprising from two days then he kept
[1:44:09] after two three weeks then he says Mr
[1:44:12] matanga your brother is now out of
[1:44:15] danger he was peeling off would take a
[1:44:18] razor to peel off the dead
[1:44:20] cells a man who was literally helping to
[1:44:23] do
[1:44:24] anything and finally he was discharged
[1:44:27] amen amen yed of cancer I don't know how
[1:44:31] all the insides were replaced which he
[1:44:33] said were eaten don't ask me but that
[1:44:36] word that prayer can go right inside
[1:44:39] there and it can
[1:44:41] create Hallelujah itself right there it
[1:44:45] can unblock your ear it can heal your
[1:44:49] eye it can heal your back it it can
[1:44:53] straighten your leg this
[1:44:56] morning that's what your God can do
[1:44:58] that's right that's right then after a
[1:45:00] while he was big home then out there
[1:45:02] begin to his hand was just going like
[1:45:04] that because that's where the can had
[1:45:05] gone in there and there was pass always
[1:45:08] coming out and then they took they took
[1:45:12] they took some maybe x-ray they said now
[1:45:16] we see in there m matanga that the bone
[1:45:19] is already eaten because his hand was
[1:45:21] just going he said the bone is eaten
[1:45:24] it's almost gone maybe let's carry out
[1:45:26] an operation I remember that morning I
[1:45:28] said the doctor doctor I think for now
[1:45:31] why can't we give The God Who healed him
[1:45:34] to give him a chance to see what he can
[1:45:37] do before you
[1:45:38] operate brother we went in for some time
[1:45:42] and then at some point then we saw uh
[1:45:45] then I think some point then they took
[1:45:48] again a picture and uh they said
[1:45:52] surprising
[1:45:53] there is a
[1:45:54] newborn that's
[1:45:56] growing if it's not there we will put it
[1:46:05] there he said there a bone that's
[1:46:07] growing I said yes that's what God is
[1:46:09] able to
[1:46:11] do then it went it went then after a
[1:46:14] Time the boy when he was playing one day
[1:46:16] that eat and born just shot through the
[1:46:19] hall it was just so thin out there and
[1:46:21] fell on the ground
[1:46:25] as if it was a small

[1:46:46] x-ray of the chest but the X-ray went
[1:46:51] over he this is
[1:46:54] surprising it's something striking
[1:46:56] because the bone is my my area is this
[1:46:59] but it I took by mistake but the bone
[1:47:02] this side looks different to the one
[1:47:04] this side I said yes about 20 to 25
[1:47:07] years ago God created a new born for the
[1:47:10] man ah

[1:54:25] probably been to the
[1:54:27] doctors you had an operation you tried
[1:54:32] everything just like Peter there you

[1:54:43] to let the net down I'm going well you
[1:54:45] say there is no fish there you sinned
[1:54:48] though through Peter you know you sinned
[1:54:51] through all night and there is no fish
[1:54:53] there if God said let down the net you
[1:54:56] will put fish there see and I believe
[1:55:01] tonight if the doctor says you can't be
