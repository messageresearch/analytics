that you have done for us Lord thank you Father God for the Breath of Life Lord thank you Father God to bring us Lord Jesus Christ in your house because the prophet says that the biggest mistake that the devil does to let your children come to your house because we know father God that once we're there Lord we can have the healing of our bodies or anything can happen Lord because he says that he's never seen somebody go to look at the cross [Music] [Music] in the book of second chronicles Second Chronicles chapter 20. [Music] and we'll read the verse 1 and verse 13. second chronicles The Chronic foreign Chronicles chapter 14 uh chapter 20 verse the clinicians and when the Bible says that it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them other beside the ammonite came against Jehoshaphat to battle foreign multitude against thee from Beyond the Sea on this side on this side Syria and behold they be in houses and telmar which is and and getting and get eyes and Jehoshaphat feared and said himself to seek the Lord and proclaim a fast throughout all Judah don't sufferers and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help from uh of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court josephat um and said oh Lord God of our fathers are now thou God in heaven and rulers not thou over all the kingdoms of the earth of the Eden sorry and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand it is drive out the the inhabiting of this land before thy People Israel and giveth it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever is and have built the a sanctuary they're in for thy name saying if one evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in that presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our Affliction then thou will hear and help see whom their word is not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not foreign how they reward us to come to cast out to cast us out of that possession which thou has given us to inheritance Oh Our God well they'll not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee Nexus stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children foreign father God will come again before Eternal Grace Lord to say Lord Jesus Christ thank you for everything be able to choose Lord I pray father God that you come and you open your word to us Lord a Man O Father God has a power to flip the pages of this book Lord by you are the only one who can give us the understanding of the word I pray father God that you come and you speak to us from my Lord that you provide to all our needs oh God Lord that you answer to our questions Lord let everything be done in your name Jesus in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen amen you may be seated so this morning we uh have a little subject that one with you amen uh we're entitled it lifting him up out of History amen stories from the Bible and by God's grace apply it to uh you know another place in the Bible where it happened afterwards amen here the Bible is talking about uh uh uh Jehoshaphat when he was invaded by the children of Moab and the ammonite um if you read the entire chapter you'll notice you'll understand that Jehoshaphat had no might or strength amen he couldn't fight them he couldn't face them and fight and overcome their battle amen amen he was afraid because he didn't know what to do a fair amen but he remembered that he served to God a man who his specialty it's in difficult times a man who says that come unto me when you are you know tired and When Trials are more lost amen so he went to God and started to remind God of his promises start to remind him of his promises he says that you are the god of our fathers you are the God in heaven you are the God who rules over the entire Earth they are the God who rules over the even over the kingdoms of the heathens and you are The God Who made everything by your name amen everything except everything uh everything was made by you and for you and so he knew that by himself he couldn't overcome he knew that about his own strength he couldn't do anything amen so he had to go call on that God of History amen he had to lift God from the history he had to lift him up out of History to bring him to bring God in his presence circumstances to lift him up out of History he meant to bring him up to bring him up to his uh present situation [Music] amen this reminds me of of Jacob amen when when Issa was uh pursuing Jacob and he wanted to kill him had many more people than Jacob he is outnumbered amen he tried to divide his uh uh his people into three different different uh sections on purpose but he found out that that couldn't work and the only solution was to go back to God Amen the only solution was to go back to God Amen and ask him for his help amen the only solution was to go talk to God to tell him about the situation you tell him about the problem to tell him about his brother who was coming to kill him the Bible says that it's a was coming was determined to kill Jacob now after Jacob had that meeting with God after Jacob had that conference with God Amen the Bible says that God did not only give him the power to overcome amen but God even changed the heart of his brother amen his brother who came to kill him and his brother who was determined to kill him no matter what amen but when the Met they started to hug they started hugging amen and during that conference Jacob's name was changed in his life as well amen because he knew where to go his hands are open foreign even here you'll see that uh uh uh the story the story of uh Hezekiah it is trying to defy God since verse 8 of the chapter 19 uh verse 9 sorry of the chapter 19 the Bible says and when you heard and when he heard say of uh uh king of Ethiopia behold he's come out to fight against thee and send Messengers against unto uh again unto Hezekiah saying saying let not thy God in whom thou trusted the safety saying Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the king of Assyria is verse 11 behold thou has heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shall and shall thou be delivered have the gods of the Nations deliver them which my fathers have destroyed as Gotham and Heron and resif and the children of Eden Eden which were in the in Taylor store where is the king of and the king of abroad and the king of the city of uh sephoraeme of Hannah and Ivan us amen he kept on telling him about the stories of how he defied other gods amen he came to uh Hezekiah telling him that but don't let your God fool you living here amen look at what my father has done to these gods that so-called God that you know amen he destroyed this King he destroyed that King and he started naming Kings after Kings he started bragging about about his power and how he was overcoming and how he was trying to go strong amen amen he started telling those things amen he told them he told him that don't let your God fool you don't let your God I'll give you give you a false hope that he would deliver you from us amen this is exactly what the devil does Amen when the devil will come to you it will always show you things that he has done he will tell you that this brother had cancer and he passed away this brother had diabetes and that killed him this brother had this and that and that and this is amen he will always show you negative stuff he will always show you trying to uh make you doubt God Amen he will always try to make you show you things that are hard to overcome so that you can uh uh you can lose your faith in God Amen he will say that this brother or sister went through the exact same thing but this is result that he lost at the end of the day amen this sister was bearing for you for her entire life she came to church every day praying and she had no results that's the work of the devil amen he will always try to show you these examples trying to discourage your faith he will always try to show you how impossible it is to overcome amen the same thing as sneaker it was showing to Hezekiah telling him about how he destroyed all the other kings by one he didn't know amen but the the gods that he destroyed amen was the word different than the god of Hezekiah he was serving a God who was powerful enough just with the single word to destroy himself was facing another God Amen a God that was different than the gods that he fought before amen came across somebody who trusted God and and physical amen he came across somebody who knew the God that he was serving if it's the first amen face he was facing a man who knew the type of God he was serving visit us it's the same thing like with Goliath yeah man I'm pretty sure that Goliath had to overcome so many battles I'm pretty sure that Goliath had to fight so many battles and he overcame amen he destroyed you know single destroying armies with his single hands amen he destroys cities and kings and kingdoms by himself by this time it was different amen this time it was different amen because he was facing David amen who wasn't like the others he was facing David amen who knew exactly the kind of God he was serving he was facing David who knew that God will always be with him and he was facing David Yemen who knew that God gave him a promise amen that he will be the king and he will never die unless he become the he becomes a king amen he will never die before before that promise to come to pass amen so that's the reason why when Goliath came to him my David Was Not Afraid amen because he was trusting God Amen because he was believing in God Amen because he knew that God will fight his battle because he knew that God gave him a promise amen that he will always fight his battles amen so Hezekiah was facing that same situation statement amen he was facing the a king amen amen somebody who was stronger than him he couldn't fight with his own mind so here's the car I had to go back to God I had to go back to the Rock hey man Hezekiah had to run to God Amen he had to have a conference with God he may talk to him about the circum about his circumstances women talk to him about his present situation amen talk to him about the trial that he was facing amen so verse 14 the Bible says that and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the mess of the messenger messenger and read it and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord from you know other uh uh countries or armies to come and join him amen but the Bible says that once the sins once you receive that letter amen he went straight to God Amen once you receive the letter amen he went straight to his creators amen verse 15 the Bible says Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said oh Lord God of Israel which dwells between the cherubims Thou Art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou has made Heaven and Earth Lord bow down thine ears and hear open lower than eyes and see and hear the words of of Seneca which has sent him to reproach the Living God of the truth Lord the kings of Assyria have destroyed I have destroyed the nations of the and their lands a man and have cast their gods Into the Fire for they were now God but the work of man's hand wood and stone therefore they have destroyed themselves now therefore O Lord Our God I beseech thee save thou Arts out of his hand they are all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God even there only amen he went to Ghana started stating those facts lord it's true that he has done this lord it's true that he has destroyed all the these Gods but the difference is those gods were created by men those guys are the work of wood and stone look love and he came to pass that and he came to pass that night that the angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of us of the Assyrians and 104 score and five thousand and went the rose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses Sydney is amen because if you read if you read in uh verse 34 before that the Bible says that this is God talking he said that for our defend the city to save it [Music] but today the people if they don't get everything they asked foreign but what we need is men and women today men and women who are determined to Hold On Foreign your strength from walking from place to place you've been to this church and you went to the other church you've been to this pasture and you go back to the other pastors amen but you still can't find relief but there is still a God that answers prayers amen there is still a God that saves from sin amen if you prayed amen and the answer seems like it's taking too long amen keep believing human God is looking for these people amen who will not take no foreign promise of God no matter how difficult the situation is no matter how hard the situation is no matter how impossible it looks like they have made up their minds are made up they're not turning back amen their minds are made up Hello amen they keep moving forward amen they keep going ahead amen they keep shouting the victory it doesn't matter how long it's taking it's like Abraham amen God gave him a promise 24 years after amen Abraham most kept shouting the victory praising God Amen Abraham most keep thanking God because you knew that God would give him that promise he was the same God who will fulfill it these are the kind of people that God is looking for amen these are the kind of Believers that God is looking that's the kind of the church that God is looking for a church that would take him in this world the church that will lift him up of history that will stand there and remind god of what he has done before amen a church that will bring that will call God to the sin [Music] churches to churches degrees you hear that this God this man here is doing Miracles and there you are running amen you're here this other one is doing this and you go away it's all good I'm not saying that there is nothing wrong with it but as long as you remember if you don't have faith inside of you I mean it doesn't matter what that person can do when he takes the faith inside of you when it takes the faith inside of you to see God in action that's why you see the prophets young lady coming to the prayer line had to let her sit let's see sit on the chairs and watch what God was doing man what was that for is it the amen it was bringing her face up there was helping her to to lift her faith no to see what God can what God is doing for the others and to have the faith that what he's doing for the others he can do it for me amen and once once she got to that point that she knew it she realized that God is still the same God for them and for her amen the prophet turned and said that you're ready now what was that he was waiting for his faith to come amen of course was there and asking about what Dad what are you doing it's only a little kid it's a very busy amen by the prophet was waiting for her for her first step to uh to to rise up amen when he was crying the son of David have mercy on me amen it wasn't the Cry of that blind man that stopped Jesus because Jesus was wherever Jesus was going people were making noises amen and Jesus was surrounded with people who wanted to touch him was talking to him was shouting and singing and all them there is no way that the Cry of their men will go to Jesus years amen but what Jesus heard was not only the cry amen but Jesus heard the faith of that the first that was going behind that Christ faith that God to Jesus see they said foreign just have faith behind Departed then comes after amen it was also before Jordan the river was there and there was no way for him to cross it Elijah remembered what God has done for Moses and and Joshua he listens amen and God Amen he called unto their God Amen he called unto that same God in the Jordan River was departed amen amen and then you come again Elijah after coming back he went with Elijah and he experienced what God has done for Elijah on his way back he had to cross that same Jordan River when he had to cross that same river he didn't know he knew that by himself he couldn't do it but he had to call out you had to lift God out of History symptoms amen the prophet says that let me more said today my brother and sister in this present day of Crisis and when cancer is in the the the world up it does and diseases of all kinds of the melody said that the same historical God that cleansed the leper they remember him at the same historical God that healed the sick am I the same historical God that raised the dead he's the same God today amen he's waiting anxiously for his people to call him on the sin for of action is the same God today amen he's waiting ancient slave for his people to call him on the scene of action is amen the one who could forgive a heart for committing adultery seven times in a day foreign was walking by and his shadow was able to heal people remember foreign years after amen tells thousands of years after amen you have that same situation coming happening again situations she couldn't have kids and God gave her a son amen and here is this son that God gave her it was and he's about to die woman started praying God is thousands of years same circumstance circumstance same situation amen she didn't have a son for she didn't have a kid for a long time him as she was Barren for a long time and she prayed God asking God for his son amen asking God for a child when God gave her a son and here's that same son dying it was even here's the same son dying and going to hell if I see the Memphis thought about the son of my the sunamite woman is it man she started thinking about her yeah she knew that God did that for her and then she started praying and saying that God if you did that for her you would do it for me asking God to send Elijah amen she didn't know who God will send amen she didn't know how that person will look like amen she didn't know how that person will get there amen but she was praying for God to send Elijah amen however he will take for that person to come in amen her prayer was God sent Elijah to me amen I'm not going to him amen I'm not going to look for him but you Lord send it to me the same way you send Elijah to that woman um amen and her prayer is amen I think that there were so many barriers that that prayer had to go through yeah because the idea was wanted so bad to take that son away from her the devil wanted so bad to show her heard how God didn't care about her job amen the devil wanted so bad to send that kid to send that kid to Hell foreign foreign [Music] foreign early in the morning for hours amen waiting for that Elijah to pass by amen she stood there for hours amen certainly the devil could come to her mind and say well you've been here for five hours and Elijah is not here amen you've been standing here for two hours God has now God has now heard your prayers so he's not gonna show up just go back and start crying amen but her faith was so strong it doesn't matter how long I'm gonna wait amen I pray the Lord amen I prayed to God Amen and I believe that God has heard my prayer amen and Elijah he's on his way amen Elijah is on his way so it doesn't matter how long I'm gonna stand here even if it would take God to come and find my bones here I will still stand here amen and while she was standing there God was leading His prophets amen God was guiding His prophets wild foreign foreign she felt the deep that was calling to another dude I mean when the prophet went to her house amen the prophet said that their house had the sweet spirit that he has never seen is once you started praying amen he was the most honest answer among the most with the most honest prayer that he has ever heard she left God out of History amen she called God out of history and God showed up a juicy manifestation amen and that God is still the same God today is amen whatever situation you're going through call unto God he will show up in knowing that people will make fun of him amen his disciple even tried to stop him from going to that place amen because he knew that Simon was calling him not to not to welcome him but to make him uh to ridiculous Amen to make fun of him amen but God who knows everything amen he knows everything before they even happen knowing what Simon would do to him amen but no matter what he showed up amen because somebody called him amen because somebody invited him to his house amen God still showed up Jews amen because God didn't want to give us a reason to say that someone called you and you didn't show up amen so no matter who you are amen you can call unto God now and God will always show up amen you can call unto God now amen and God will always be there amen because he always shows up to his uh appointment but you have the benefit of that of it of his presence amen it depends on your attitude am I noticed that Simon called Jesus to his house Jesus was there Jesus showed up then he put Jesus in the corner amen he didn't receive the blessing that comes with Jesus presence amen he didn't receive the blessings that comes with his presence because wherever Jesus goes amen he always bring his blessings with him amen wherever he goes he always bring blessings with him he may notice when when he sent his disciples the first time he sent his disciples to go preach on people's doors amen those who will welcome you bless them but those who will not welcome walk away um because wherever he goes he always has his blessings but for you to receive those blessings amen you have to take care of him you have to give him the first place you have to wash his feet amen to his anoint his feet amen you have to take care of him so that's why the blessings I was supposed to go to Simon what happened amen who took care of Jesus Amen Jesus always show up Amen in the morning when we come to church we say Lord come here we say Lord we need you Lord we want you to be in our meets amen that's everybody's prayer amen one week before we left the house when we go to church we say we go to church to meet God Amen he's always the first person to go to an event amen God is here even right now amen but the blessings that you will received amen he depends on how much you will care for him amen the blessings that you will received amen he depends on your treatment it depends on how you will take care of him the blessings that you will received amen he depends on how you will take care of God Amen that's why the prophet said that he has never seen somebody going to Calvary and coming back the same amen because when you go to God's presence amen you will never come back something inside of you has to change the transformation that happens yeah there is a transformation that takes place man he's never been with Jesus before you know he's never he'll hurt Jesus preaching amen he was there determined to kill his disciples but when you went to that conference with God when you went to Calvary he may want the pillar of fire showed up like around the full City I mean it was another person to send his Prophet she knew that God will always always show up to his appointment so every time you call God always shows up there is a story that the prophet told once I don't know if it's also in the Bible amen of this family is it for me amen the husband and wife amen they prayed God they said Lord we invite you in our house Lord we want you to come and feast with us amen they made that prayer amen everything perfectly fine he meant to set the table they said Lord this time we want you Lord to show up amen they made the food they were expecting God to come and eat with him right at that time where they were expecting God to show up they heard somebody knocking at the door somebody knocking at the door the husband told his wife well what time is it's 2 p.m oh we call God at 2 p.m believe that's God okay I'm gonna go and open the door that's got nothing because we're not expecting anybody else so he went and opened the door and he saw a homeless guy he left coming and asking for food amen that guy was so generous he took some of the food and then he gave to that man well since it's late let me go and call him and to ask him to bring back to come back and eat the rest of the food so when you open the door he didn't he couldn't find that man anymore he didn't know where he went um so at the end of the night before the day went on and God did not show up because they were expecting a certain type of God and he didn't show up Allah they had their own image of God how God will be and that God did not show up amen so they want to pray a night they say Lord who prayed and we cooked and everything we're expecting you to come and you did not show up amen and God answered back to him I think in a dream and he said yes I was there when you called me I was there I showed up those foreign but we always have to know one thing that God will be there that's the most important thing that we have to know that will be there how is it gonna be there I don't know when is it gonna show up I don't know but I know one thing for sure even it doesn't matter how long it took it doesn't matter how long this will take oh no God will show up you may the prophet says here you Prophet to do DC now what started it okay amen talking about Eve amen he says that reasoning he says that faith has no reason you don't reason at all but you believe when you prayed for when you are prayed for and accept God's word for healing the only reason with your feelings don't reason with nothing else there is no reasoning to it in a minute that you reason on God's word then you're losing faith see don't have no yes nose maybe so we know stay right with it see if had the right approach correct amen because she was quoting to the serpent the word but she listened to his reasoning there is just so many people today that has the right knowledge that knows that this word shall be God's word and it's God's word by the stand and let some people reason them out of it is away from the things of God reasonings we have to cast them down once you start reasoning with the word of God that's when you lose your faith that's when you start losing your face don't reason with the word of God God gives you the word God gave you the promise you just have faith images because you don't know the relationship that you have between they don't know the relationship between you and your God they don't know what God told you amen so therefore I don't have to tell you how this is gonna happen amen the only thing that I can tell you is to wait and see see that Tundra amen you would know it when it will happen because I will come back to you and tell you the testimony amen so it doesn't matter how this is gonna happen I'm telling you how are you gonna get out of that bed I don't know God gave me the promise amen God said that he's my healer amen he will come and heal me amen how are you gonna get out of that situation I don't know amen it's not my job to find out how amen but I know one thing for sure amen I have prayed amen I have asked God Amen God gave me his promise amen so I

me that's the only thing I care about is the promises the only thing important to me to find out a promise faith in it foreign a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic an enormous song characters amen and since God wants us to share to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and sat down on his father's throne foreign and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the temp uh the tremendous Glory that we will that will be revealed in us when it comes is it put it to France amen God wants you to reign with them and God wants you to sit on this throne with him that's the reason why he sends us all those uh trials that's the reason why we have to overcome because I always say that that there
