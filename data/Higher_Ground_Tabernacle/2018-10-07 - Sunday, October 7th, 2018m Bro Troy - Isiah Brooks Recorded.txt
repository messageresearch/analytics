[Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] man let's just stand and honor the hope get right into the service here good to see everybody here this morning amen here to worship the Lord amen amen we came here for a reason amen we know that God is able to meet with us to heal us to deliver us amen to to bind up the brokenhearted amen to set the captives free his spirit is here Amen where two or three are gathered in his name Amen so let's just open our Bibles to Genesis first chapter and from there we'll go to psalms 133 and Genesis 1 in second verse it says and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen amen now stir her to psalms 133 for either all three verses of the chapter Psalms 133 says behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments and as the dew of Hermon and as the dew that descend upon the mountains of Zion for there the LORD commanded the blessing even life forevermore amen let's just bow our heads and word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for coming into this place Lord we just invite you here Lord Lu the last Lord that you would be comfortable here Lord Lord we we we we give you the highest place Lord we bow down in your sight father floor we do not count ourselves worthy of your presence father but knowing Lord that you made the promise Lord that if we would just come and hide underneath your wings Lord if we would just come and hide underneath your blood or did you come and have fellowship with us one with the other and Laura saw oh and underneath that promise father we gathered here this morning there where two or three are gathered in your name you said you'd be right there in the myths and or that is the promise that we gather together underneath this morning father and we'll always want to thank you for coming into this place if we turn the entire service over your hands knowing that when you come you heal and you deliver and you set free Lorna you commune one with us or Lord you fill with your holy spirit father and slowly just and thank you Lord come to this place and we just give you the highest preeminence in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen I just wanted to speak a message this morning called the brooding of the Holy Spirit amen amen you know the Lord said in Revelations he said the spirit and the bride say come amen the spirit and the bride are both saying come come well where is he calling us to a many for the spirit and the bride to say come there must be somewhere that we are that he doesn't necessarily want us to be there anymore but wants to call us out of that into something else amen so in when God begins calling he has a place he wasn't he has a place where you are and a place where he wants to take you to Amen so so when God begins calling and it's just like there in Genesis chapter 1 when he when the Holy Spirit was brooding over the face of the waters the earth was in a certain condition and he began calling to that earth began speaking out to that earth because the earth was then somewhere where he didn't want that earth to be a menace why did God do he started speaking to the earth he started calling out to the earth as we said last week God put his word into the earth and what the plants sprung up out of the earth they meant as the as God put his word in the waters the fish started springing out amen but his God began to put his word down into the himself and say let us free forth what he create his own self amen turn the piano note yeah [Music] Amen so is so as God begins calling out he has he do he takes things he sees where they are he says I don't want that to be there I don't want that to be in that condition so he speaks to it and he calls to it and as his word goes out it goes out and is and when and when whatever it is he's speaking to if he's speaking to a person when that person begins to receive that word that person begins moving from where they are on the direction to where God wants him to be why because there was a willing heart there that was willing to receive the word of God amen when a willing heart begins to receive the Word of God it begins moving from where it is to where God has in his mind for it to be a man we saw that in the creation of the world where God saw the world was it a condition he didn't want the world to be in the condition that it was a man so he started speaking to it and because the earth was willing to receive the word the earth the earth now now Mars didn't receive that word yo and we and man as as scratching their heads trying to figure out how can we get there to live on Mars what can we do and you know if we get this machine and this machine and in this machine and all the things and why because God's Word didn't go there that's why we're all in all of our intelligence we haven't figured out yet how to get there and survive why because God's Word didn't go there God's Word came here amen and that's why this earth is a fit place to live because God's Word came here amen but now also but God's Word there in Revelation said the spirit and the bride are saying come amen now that's why I am here this morning amen because someone looked at me and said come amen someone looked at me one day they looked at me and they said come and when I looked at that that man was brother Keith brother Keith looked me in the face one day and he said come and when he sent spoke to me I knew that what he was saying he wasn't just saying come over to lunch yeah I knew he wasn't speaking there but when he spoke to me in the vestibule the church that I was attending he said come my mind immediately went to that scripture in Revelations that he was not just speed and mention that scripture but in my mind's eye I knew exactly that he was referring not to some natural coming to this event or coming to that event but that he was speaking from Revelation chapter 22 there where the spirit and the bride say come and brother Keith said to me that day come and I can't and Here I am Amen what happened the word came out of brother Keith's mouth unto me and I came and Here I am a man now I am saying to anybody here if you have not come yet let me say to you this morning come come why because there is a place where if you're not where you're supposed to be then let me speak to you this morning come why because God has a place he wants you to be amen and it's not over here it's over here amen if you're not over here yet then then by the speaking of the word it would get you from this place over to this place amen and what I know how did God do it in the beginning he did it by the brooding of the Holy Spirit they meant the very first step God created the heavens and the earth but God looked upon the earth and it was not in the condition he wanted it to be now God has created you are you in the condition that you ought to be in yet and we look down at our own selves and we say oh my I got this wrong of this that I do I do this it's not right we're not in the condition that God wants us to be so what does the Holy Spirit do when he finds a body whether it be a planet or a human being what does God do and he finds a body that's not in the condition that he wants it to be in he starts brooding over brooding over it brooding over the Holy Spirit just begins moving across the face moving around it and what does he do he starts speaking his word to it speaking his word to it why because he wants it to be changed transformed into the image of what he has in his mind amen and that's what he's doing the smart a mess so we read there in psalms 133 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity that's interesting cuz he's talking about two brothers two Christians a mint if you would to Christians and wonder they're both spirit-led believers of Jehovah amen and how good how pleasant it is for them to dwell together in unity what happens when two brethren start fellowshiping one with the other over the Word of God I'm on your way no when a one brother starts to fellowship with another brother all sin your heart begins burning within you you start talking about the Word of God and your heart and your mind gets excited why because you have things in common your fellowshipping over the word you guys start getting exciting your blurb and said you know some of the read one of the reasons why we don't have why Jesus doesn't come around us as much as we like him is because we don't talk about him enough amen B says the more you talk about him the more he comes Amen the more you talk about the Lord Jesus Christ the more he will visit you Amen lot of us don't see him in our houses very often and angels don't visit our places very often why because we don't talk about him enough amen but the more we talk about him the more we fellowship with them the more that he will come and visit our house amen so what so the more so there in Saul's 1:33 Jesus or the Lord talked about King David's writing there behold how good is for unpleasant is for brethren to dwell together in unity he says it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments now why is it that two men fellow should be one with the other is just like a high priest being anointed to go into the holiest of holies why is why is King David linking these things two things together amen so think about who hears air in the high priests he's being prepared to go into the holiest of Holies amen now that morning he woke up in his tent right he woke up in his tent where he is home where he lived and as he woke up that morning he realized this is the day the one day a year that I go in with the blood of the lamb to to make the sacrifice for the sins of the nation once here and as he gets up out of bed he puts his garments upon it he knows that this is a solemn day and he has to go in to go to begin to prepare the service of the Lord hey man so as he goes in he begins he and he leaves his tent door and he walks down across the road there and he goes up to the to the tabernacle in the in the wilderness there and he parts the opens the curtain doors and he goes into the courtyard there what's he doing he's getting ready to fellowship with the Lord amen he's getting ready to fellowship with the Lord amen so what does he do he has to go into the outer court yes how the the the lamb has to be prepared the lamb has to be sacrificed lamb has to be ready a man he has to go to the brazen altar he has to wash he has to get prepared amen so then he has to go into the holy place he has to draw another curtain back amen and as he draws that curtain back he goes in there he's like he's fellowshipping he's he has the the manna is there he can eat the word he can he can worship in the church amen he can he can be there it protected from the elements you know as we've all heard the the steps the steps of a believer but then he prepares to go into the Holy of Holies he has to change his garments they meant he's got to be washed he's got to be changed he puts on the priestly garments he's got to be a prayer to go in to meet Joba amen he has to have the anointing oil upon him now when they anointed some well they didn't just put a little cup or just put a little dab on no but they took the holy anointing oil and they poured it upon his head and it ran down and it covered him amen now you remember that holy anointing oil I know if I preached about it in the past but when when when God gave them this recipe for the holy anointing oil he said this is a very specific recipe amen and when you make this it wasn't just olive oil but it was a very specific recipe and God says I want you to take a little bit of this and a little bit of this and a little bit of this and a little bit of this and this you get you know the cinnamon that would come from a hundred miles over here you know on the calamus okay from 100 miles over this direction and you get this from this field that grows off over here and from the whole boundaries around Israel they had to go and gather all these precious spices and things and gathering from all over the land and bring them into one place and prepare them in a certain way and mix it together and he said and God told them you cannot cannot have this specific recipe in your own house you can't try to make this in your own kitchen but you can only make it right here in the holy place that's the only place this recipe can be used amen so so when so an errand would go there and he'd be anointed and they'd cover him with that holy anointing oil it had a particular odor that no one could smell anywhere else amen and create a specific atmosphere that couldn't be recreated anywhere else amen because if you tried to recreate that that holy anointing oil and bring it into your own house and use it in your own house you could be judged for that you could be put to death for that amen why because this is a specific a specific recipe that God said this is only for the house the boy for the forth for the Levites amen so an errand would go in and get prepared and change his garments amen and be washed and ready to go into the holy place you'd be anointed with this holy anointing oil amen was he - he's getting ready to fellowship with Jehovah okay let's turn over to Psalms 91 think about it he's getting ready you wakes up that morning I am getting ready to fellowship with Jehovah what would that feel like what Mike you think about I'm gonna go through there I know it's been in those curtains in a year they meant we're getting ready to fellowship with Jehovah ninety-one verse one says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge in my fortress my god in him will I trust amen now I think I he that dwelleth in the secret place and the Most High God shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty that just does something to your soul when you read that doesn't it but think about but that was just for the high priest but the high priest as he was anointed with this holy anointing oil that down generation after generation here the tabernacle the wilderness and you had the tabernacle at Shiloh then you had the temple of David almost all those times it was only to the priests they were allowed to go into that holy place amen but God had a special way for them to approach into there but when when all those generations that they had that holy anointing oil all those generation after generation it was only allowed to be one place the anointing was only allowed to be one place if you were part of the tribe of Zebulun you couldn't have the holy anointing what amen yeah you couldn't enter into the holy suppose you couldn't enter into the holy place amen if you if you if Aaron the high priest would walk by you and you could smell that odor or you draw eyes I've never smelled that before I think I know where he's been Amen why because he had been fellowshiping with Jehovah amen and when he fellowship with Jehovah it changed his entire beam amen it changed him why because you cannot meet face to face with God without being changed he had been fellowshiping with Jehovah Amen and then oh that holy anointing oil would soak into your skin and that wood couldn't necessarily just be washed off so easily Amen so the whole day if he walked by someone you know the next day that odor could still be there you could still smell either where have you been where have you been I I that I've never smelled that before where have you been who who have you been fellowshiping with I've been in the holey Cipolla place I was in where the Shekinah presence of the Lord is I bore the sacrifice for the sins of Israel amen that yours your sins have been taken care of a man but you know that how many times you know from from that time from the from the time of the Tabernacle in the wilderness all the way to King Davis time those hundreds and hundreds of years that the holy anointing oil could not leave the tabernacle there all of a sudden one day that God 500 years after that pattern being the same the same the same the same the same that the that the the prophet Samuel is just going about his business there and God speaks to him and says go and take the Horn of oil and leave the tabernacle now this is an unusual circumstance amen when God spoke to the prophet Samuel and say go and take that Horn of oil and leave the tabernacle taking a waste where the high priest would use it and go down to Bethlehem five miles journey away and go down unto the house of Jesse something unusual is happening God was not just going to fellowship with the high priest but God had picked a man by the name of David that he wanted to fellowship with amen so he said go down to the house of Jesse and anoint a man by the name when one of his sons Amen and he goes down there and he lines up you know the eleven sons as he remember the story and and and samuel the prophet samuel look or as a Nathaniel Samuel Samuel I was looking at the signs that said and looked at him and said it's none of these you know and they bring David and he's off from the field they say well go get him and they bring David in and and the prophecy says this is the one that God desires to fellowship with this is the one that God has called it this is the one that the Holy Spirit wants is brooding over right now or is it God went and picked the David and says I have called him by name he is mine he's the Holy Spirit is now brooding over him he's taking it from where he is to change him into what he wants them to be and Samuel the Prophet same Allah takes the Horn oil and pours it over him it hits his head and it runs down his if he had a beard I don't know if he did that age probably not he runs down his face and he goes all the way down all the skirts and he's oh my I've been anointed I've been anointed what is it it's the Holy Spirit that brooded over the world back in the beginning has now hand-picked a man by the name David and says I want to fellowship with you I have been anointed just like the high priests of old now I who has never had a chance to be a high priest now I have been anointed God wanted to fellowship with someone a man that's why now again now David he takes these songs and he's Lincoln and he says just looing how pleasant is for men to fellowship one with the other whether they fellowship being in the spirit the holy spirit that's brooding over this man and the same Holy Spirit the broods over this man when those two men get together and they fellowship one to the other you begin to feel the effects of the Holy Spirit fellowshipping with the Holy Spirit amen God communing with himself through you oh my then you begin to realize that I am a son or a daughter of God amen amen how good pleasant is for men to fellowship and unity not one in doctrine not one in going to the same church but one that fellowships in the same spirit united by the same Holy Ghost amen amen when you realize that your brother is handpicked by God just like you were hand-picked by God and you could fellowship one with another Amen you know but you know what can block that fellowship you know like we reach people in the past about the leprosy in the Old Testament you know when a man was stricken with leprosy they had to take him outside of the camp a man he couldn't fellowship he was separated from fellowship with the camp amen and so is it like a man and women when they sent if you do not take care of the sin in your life and that sin is crying out and then you cannot fellowship one with the other amen amen how can the Holy Spirit fellowship one with the other when the sin blocks it amen sin separates you from fellowship a man what is that the horse Pharaoh wants to brood over you why because God wants to fellowship with himself amen God was to fellowship with his own kind amen you know we can we can have dogs and pets and different things like that but it's not like fellowshiping with your own kind amen and so is with God he wants to fellowship with his own kind you know his heart his thoughts are higher than our thoughts but when he puts his thoughts inside of you and puts his spear inside of you they began to you begin to think like God thinks Amen when you get anointed you can be when you get start being led by the Holy Ghost you begin thinking like God thinks a man you've been speaking God's words but you can only do that when you're filled with the Holy Ghost amen Alleluia you know brother band says that we only live in a three-room house you got the kitchen you got the bedroom and you got the living room and program he said you know when when when a sinner comes he comes into the kitchen he hears the Word of God amen he be he eat he's eating the Word of God and he begins to be changed from the sinner that he is so what so he can now fellowship with God he can have fellowship one with the other so he goes into the living room in the kitchen to the living room even fellowshiping one with the other amen but you know you know what but the bedroom is where people rest right amen as much community as you can have amen the the the you can commune with God in the living room but after a while it's time to go home and you have to leave amen but those that go to the bedroom are testifying this is my house this is where I live this is where I dwell now you can come to my house and you can eat in my kitchen you can you can commune with me am I am I in my living room but you know I don't invite just anybody to come and sleep in my bed that's designed for my bride a mess designed for my wife that's where my wife rests that's where I rest amen that's where we take our rest amen that's where we live and you can come you can dwell but the bed there's for me amen amen no I don't mind if you come and stay in my guest bedroom but but uh now think about it now but the time comes where that person has to go home I've had many visitors come to my house I've had some spend the night but they've all at some point gone home amen bus but when you come into the bedroom you're testifying this is where I live this is where I dwell this is where I live and move and have my beam amen and even so is it with God when you when you when you hear the word of God you invite Jesus into your kitchen amen you received that word you eat that word you see you're in agreement with it amen it was a do it allows you to go into the living room we start communing with God but at some point the Holy Spirit is still brooding over you and what does the Holy Spirit trying to do he wants to find a place where he can rest amen now think about it the Holy Spirit back in Genesis was brooding over the dark earth over the waters but there was no place he could land there was no place he could rest there's no place he could put his feet so when he started speaking to the waters and the earth came out and now there was a place where he could rest amen then what'd he do he kept brooding and brooding over the earth and told there was a garden called Eden amen and once that Garden of Eden was created what'd he do he took the tree of life and he planted it there and this is where the tree of life Jesus Christ lived amen this is where he took up house this is where he put down his roots amen this is where he what was this is where he dwelt this is where the tree of life was was in the garden the hoist spirit that was brooding now has found a place to take rest take root this is where it stays he had found the bedroom of the planet Earth the Garden of Eden was the bedroom a planet Earth it was a place where his shelter it was separate from the rest of the earth it was a sitz own place and so God put his Tree of Life right there so it could take roots that was the Holy Spirit when Noah's when Noah's we know is told to build the ark he was building the ark and building the ark and building the ark and but one day all of a sudden a little dove a pair of doves flew up and asked can I come in here and stay and take my rest and he's told the doves you know come on in and the holy spirit like a dove was in the ark amen so in so when when the flood covered all over a whole face of the earth a man Noah took the Dove and he sang out the window and the Holy Spirit the dog was going over the earth and it could not find any place to rest so it came back to the earth the Dove was looking for a place to rest but it could not find a place they meant who happened in the time of John the Baptist this the the voice came to him and said go and baptize and prepare a people for the coming of the Lord and make people make the people ready for the coming of the Lord and then later that same voice came and said the the the one that was promised to come will come and he and he will be the one that you see the Holy Spirit descending upon like a dove and when you see the Holy Spirit descending upon the one that descends upon that's the one that you baptized that's the one who that's the one who is the Christ amen that'll save his people Israel I saw John the Baptist's going around that day he's baptizing people get him ready getting ready getting ready and all sunny sees Jesus Christ says this is the Lamb of God it takes away the sins of the world this is the one that I saw in the spirit descend upon like enough was that the Holy Spirit had been brooding even visiting all the prophets they've been visiting the kings he'd been visiting men and women throughout all the Old Testament but he could not find a place to rest so every time the Holy Spirit came to visit someone like a Hannah was was praying and praying for a child remember amen but then someone came and visitor and healed her but that one the visitor left amen like Gideon you know he's talking to this person also he hasn't realized after he leaves that I was talking to God himself amen Abraham you know is talking to those the the three there and also me was really one is Jehovah but they left they came they visit and they left but that's how the Old Testament was there was visitation after visitation after visitation but every time they left but the Holy Spirit who been brooding over all the Old Testament now I come to Jesus Christ the Tree of Life and have found a place where he could rest and the voice told the voice told John the Baptist the one that you see the Holy Spirit descending upon and remaining on that is my son so it's not just the one that the Holy Spirit comes and visits it's not just the one that has a dream not just the one that has a vision not just the one that that God answers one of your prayers it's not just one who had chills going up and down their back it's not just one that that you maybe you have a religious mindset where you just like being a religious it's not just the ones that that enjoy going to church amen it's not just the one where the Holy Spirit and he goes where you feel good here in church but then you go home and you live any old kind of way that's not the kind we're talking about no the hoist bear is still brooding amen but the Holy Spirit is brooding over a people and he's looking for a place where he could stay and rest amen the Holy Spirit is brooding and once I have a place where he can rest where he can live where he can stay the one that you see that's what he told John the Baptist the one that you see the Holy Spirit descending upon and remaining on that is the Son of God amen well we're still looking for sons and daughters of God aren't we amen and they are the ones that the Holy Spirit descends upon and her beans amen repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen for the promises unto you and to your children and even as many as the Lord your God shall call why because the Holy Spirit has been brooding and he's now wants to rest in you the same Holy Spirit from for 6,000 years that's been brooding that brood over the planet that brooded in Noah's day that brooded over Jesus Christ that brooded over the hundred and twenty that same Holy Spirit is still here what she wants to do he wants to fellowship one with the other amen that's why when you talk about him he draws near because he wants to stay there he wants to dwell there Amen he wants to live and move and then you have the beam amen amen you know I just I was thinking about the the effects the Holy Spirit on your life you know the you know I got I got a new company truck and I didn't have my CDs in there brother branham's sermons yet and I usually I keep those in my truck so I can listen I'm driving around from place to place and listen to the messages and so I turned on the talk radio and what a week to be listening to talk radio if you follow politics at all and you know I used to listen to politics a lot as a teenager and I listen to a lot of when I was a teenager I used to listen to a lot of conspiracy type stuff and politics anything political I just was fascinated by all that but over time of a few years you know freshmen aged 1618 of listening to all that I began to realize a pattern of the emotions that you would go through when you listen to this thing those things you know and and you know when you think about you know the different types of conspiracies that are out there you know and or the talk shows and different things of liberals versus the conservatives and all the political things that go on in our country those things are out there to make you angry and to make you fearful amen if you listen to that long enough you will be angry and fearful a many others I was so I spent kind of a week I just listened to the talk radio and and and recognizing those those old emotions trying to come back you know and I'm like you know why is this you know I'm like Lord you know I thinking about our car our Congress you know a little bit of do unto others as you would have them do unto you it go a long ways right now you know and I just looking at the Supreme Court process and I'm like my goodness if anybody if everybody would just do unto others as they would have them do unto you then a lot of this would just melt to the ground like it's so quick quicker than anything Amen you know if the Holy Spirit could find a place to rest and our Congress right now or in the Senate chambers or in the judiciary chamber if the Holy Spirit could brood over that chamber and find some people to rest upon then this country could be changed amen amen why because we would begin to see the fruits of the spirit love joy peace longsuffering gentle this goodness faith meekness temperance but I didn't hear any of that this week every time I turn on my radio I couldn't find any goodness or any meekness or any gentleness or temperance a man I couldn't find any long-suffering I my my spirit was brooding the Holy Spirit and media was brooding over my radio and I couldn't find any rest in it I couldn't find any place for me to rest I gotta have the fruits of the Spirit in my life amen what was coming out of my radio wasn't giving me love joy peace gentleness meekness and I started thinking about it I'm like Lord you know I have one place he saw was 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty that's where I want to live I don't want to live on Rush Limbaugh Amen I don't want to live in the painting that they're trying to paint for the picture that they're painting for me amen I don't want to live in the Democrat painting I don't want to live in the Republican painting Amen I don't want to live in Donald Trump's painting I want to live in the painting of he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty that's where I want to live that's why cuz I am brooding why am i brooding because the Holy Spirit that is in me a man is brooding over this world trying to find a place where I can rest I know a place I can rest is weren't commune with God Almighty the only place I can have to rest in this world is me and God face-to-face communing one with the other that's the only place where I can find rest I have to find love joy peace gentleness goodness meekness that's the fruits that I live by amen I got to have them because I gotta live I gotta have sustenance something has got to feed me amen and I and and fear and doubt and hatred we cannot won't feed me amen amen I've become

is doing this Oh Caesar is doing that oh I owe these taxes and and all this and no he could have gotten so angry but he said he go up to a mountain and pray amen he says you can give Caesar what is Caesar's but I am definitely gonna give God what is God's and let me tell you my soul my being my my flesh my body my spirit my soul it belongs to the Lord and I will give unto the Lord what is his Amen and there is only one thing that I can feed upon and that is the Word of God amen if you look to the things of this world they'll make you angry they'll make you fearful but the Holy Spirit cannot feed upon that the Holy Spirit is brooding he's looking for a place to rest and you have to feed him the Word of God in him we live in him we move in him we have our being amen amen God plants his seed and the only place it can grow is on good ground that is the only place the seed can grow is in good ground amen and a fearful and a doubting heart is not good ground amen and if you are constantly feeding on the things of this world it'll make you angry and fearful but if you feed upon the word of God you will become the good ground that the seed can grow in amen amen that's the fellowship the God is good looking for know what it what is good jesus said the good ground was a honest and good heart and honest a good heart now in order to be an honest and good heart you have to believe Christ you have to repent of your sins you have to be washed a man you have to be sanctified Amen you have to believe God's Word in order to be good ground amen and that is where the seeds will grow what seats the see eternal life eternal life the tree of life what kind of fruits does the Tree of Life bear love joy peace gentleness goodness meekness long-suffering love amen these are the fruits then and what do you do with those fruits when you live off those fruits you eat those fruits and that you the Tree of Life is a well springing up with inside of you and has fruits that is going to bring out a man and you partake of those fruits and you become what you eat amen so we are partaking of the Spirit of God amen don't you realize what those aren't love joy peace that's the very DNA of God Himself that is the very DNA of God himself that is his seed that is his characteristics when he plants his see that's what grows up that's because that's what he is that's who he hits and when that grows inside of you now you can be transformed from the person that you once were now he's saying come come come come come and you're being drawn you're being drawn now where you're entering into his likeness a man you're not you're not entering into the painting of CNN you're not entering into the painting of BBC you're not entering into the the whatever Fox News is painting but you're entering into Jehovah Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God amen amen there's play in this world the week he angry about but Jesus and the disciples could've been angry about the Roman government too but they weren't called to be angry about that the Roman government was going to do what the roman government is going to do our government our country that grew up like a lamp will speak like a dragon it's been prophesied that this that this country that grew up like a lamb will begin to speak like a dragon yes it's not gonna be pretty it's gonna be ugly but thanks be unto God that we can dwell in the secret place of the Almighty amen amen he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide underneath the shadow of the Almighty and I'll say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust amen and surely he shall deliver me a mint isn't that the truth amen amen amen you know as you know just like our brothers and sisters from Congo there's many things that could get angry about with the Congolese government you know South Africa there's a lot of things you get angry with about the South African government you know the minim Erica there's a lot of things you get angry with the American government but we are not of these countries we've been called up and out of these countries amen to a heavenly kingdom amen and there is our one heavenly king and we are his subjects and he lives by love joy peace gentleness goodness meekness amen amen amen we've we have a new passport amen we can we can we can travel you know a passport what does it do it lets you escape out of where you are and go to somewhere else amen we've been called we don't have to stay here it's like if you have a passport I could go and I could visit another country but then I can come back it lets me pass amen so now I am in heavenly places in Christ Jesus I can always come back amen I am a citizen of the Most High God I am a citizen of heaven this is that's where I live that's where I dwell I have a right to be there amen and if I ever fine myself not there a man if somehow my mind is as gone because it has has left the presence of Jehovah I have a pass where I can come right back to it how do I come back to it by entering into the holiest of Holies by entering in by the blood of the Lamb a can wash me he can cleanse me amen I could enter back into the presence of the Most High God why so I can do well amen and be healed and live where I'm supposed to live amen the Holy Spirit is still brooding over man and women looking for a place where he can live where he can rest amen and he wants to live and rest in you and it gives you this privilege of living here on this world you're in this world but your honor of this world amen I can it's like when when the resurrection happened in the time of Jesus and the graves were open and many of the saints of old were seen walking around the city they might not have liked what the Roman government was doing amen you know him Abraham's like you know what this Roman government's a little bit different than they were this place was just a wilderness you know but I don't have to stay here amen I got a promise Amen this thing the things of this world are just temporary amen the way to eat Abraham when he was resurrected in the time of Jesus Christ had a ticket out of there amen he was seen about the city but he didn't have to stay in the city a man he knew he is going to another place Amen so are we we're going to another place this world is not our home we're just a passin through amen amen a man we've been filled with the Holy Ghost we've been washed in the blood of the Lamb we've been called the fellowship one with the other amen it's like if you're over in another country and you find so you meet someone who is from your hometown you guys have things in common you can fellowship together at the restaurant everybody over here is you will wonder what you talking about because they didn't grow up in the town you grew up in so is a soul with two brother and their Fellowship II and the Holy Ghost a man why because they talk about the things the Lord how good and pleasant is for men to dwell brethren to dwell together in unity it's like when the Holy Spirit flows down over Aaron's beard and he's covered with the presence of Jehovah amen covered in the presence of Jehovah let's turn to Isaiah chapter 8 I'm turning to the scripture just because of experiences that this country is going through just how divisive it is because sigh this our culture is gonna get worse and worse we haven't seen anything yet amen and Sodom and Gomorrah there were as crowds going from door to door knocking looking for people they meant you know it's gonna get worse things I don't know how long we're gonna be here but it's gonna get worse amen in Isaiah chapter 8 for the prophet Isaiah is everybody was worried about the Syrian government everybody in Jerusalem and all of Israel they knew they were getting ready to be attacked the Syrian government is gonna cross the border and was gonna attack them and overtake them and overcome them and they were scared they didn't know what to do and there was many they were wondering how are we gonna survive the oncoming attack how are we gonna survive the upcoming war when the Assyrians come to take away our place and Miam said let us go down to Egypt and seek a confederacy a union with Egypt so that their armies can be our armies and our armies can be their armies so when the Syrians come down we can trust in the armies of Egypt and so let's read here in a Isaiah 8 verse 7 actually we'll start verse 5 it says and the Lord spake also unto me again saying for as much as this people refuse us the waters of Shiloh that goes softly the waters of Shiloh what was that that was where God well I meant that's where that's where God used to live that's where God's Tabernacle used to be but they refused that and they accepted wicked Kings right amen so as for as much as this people that refuses the waters of Shiloh that goes softly and rejoice and resin or amalias son amen those are the gods of the gods of Assyria and other countries now therefore behold the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of Assyria and all his glory and he shall come over all of his channels and go all over all his banks and he shall pass through Judah and shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck and stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of the land oh Emmanuel oh my the land where God is living the land where God is dwell the enemy's gonna come in like a flood all the way up to the neck amen the the enemy's armies will overflow their banks and why is he doing it because they love the gods of the other countries because they love the gods of the other countries the armies of the other countries came and flooded over them now let's take that down to the bride of Lord Jesus Christ what would happen to us if we began to love the world or the things of the world when the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ begins to love the world or the things of the world then the armies of that world will come in like a flood and you who thought you could play with this thing will come and they'll cover you up even to the neck they meant now let me keep reading here verse 9 us talking about the association with Egypt for protection associate yourselves oh you people and ye shall be broken in pieces give ear all ye of far countries gird yourself and you shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and you shall be broken in pieces take counsel together and it shall come to naught speak the word it shall not stand for God is with us for the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people well people doing their girding themselves for a journey go down to Egypt to find safety for the for Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people saying say he not a confederacy to all them who those people shall say a confederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid don't be afraid of the things that they're afraid of don't be angry about the things that they're angry about don't be frustrated about the things that they're frustrating about the why because we have a god named Jehovah we don't have to fear their fears we don't have to be afraid of what they are afraid of and we ought to get angry about what they get angry about amen why because they are not in control of us we're from another country sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself let him be your fear let him be your dread if you're gonna be afraid of something be afraid of Jehovah lest we should be displeasing to him and he shall be us he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel and for a jinn of snared inhabitants of Jerusalem and many among them shall stumble and fall on me broken and be snared and be taken by but there will be somebody that's gonna trust in the name of the Lord somebody's not going to be afraid of those things somebody is not going to fear those things somebody's going to trust in joven Amen you know I tell you this country is going to get worse and worse it's been prophesied to happen but we don't have to be afraid of their fears Amen but look but look what happened in the midst of when their country was falling apart those that were playing with the things of the world the enemy came in like a flood to them think about the very armies of the gods that they of the countries whose gods they're worshiping came and destroyed them they thought they could worship that enemies gods and peace but then the armies of those enemies came and overtook them so is it with us if we begin to worship the world or the things of this world amen or the sins of this world then the very enemies of this world will come in take you like a foot amen why be so be vigilant why because your enemy the devil is going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and he will come in like a flood amen but those who are not running off looking for Confederacy looking for protection or or looking for the Republicans to help you or the Democrats to help you amen amen look unto God himself amen he will be your help the hint fear his fears fear you know be afraid of him they fear him dread him dread Jehovah Amen lest you be found on the wrong side of him hey man what the Holy Spirit is brooding he's looking for a place to rest and where he finds the place to rest he will plant the tree of life there and I'll bring forth his fruit in due season amen and you don't have to fear their fears you don't have to dread their dreads amen you do it you're at peace forevermore amen amen that's what God does hey man the spirit and the bride said come where are they telling you to come to come into Christ underneath the sheltering wings of the Almighty God amen where the Holy Spirit comes and lives in remains who said it the spirit and the bride those that were called amen amen let's just an amen he's got a hidden manna for us amen amen you partake of his word he gives you the strength to overcome a man let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we know Lord that you desire for us to be in a specific condition Lord and a specific condition is only given to overcomers and that condition is a condition of an atmosphere
