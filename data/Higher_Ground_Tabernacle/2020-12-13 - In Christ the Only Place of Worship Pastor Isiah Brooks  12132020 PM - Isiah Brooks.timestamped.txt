[46:44] [Music]
[46:51] [Music]
[46:57] [Music]
[46:59] my soul
[47:14] [Music]
[47:21] yes
[47:27] [Music]
[47:34] thank god for his grace amen
[47:37] we have been talking with a sister from
[47:41] cincinnati ohio this is
[47:44] her name sarah we trust that sarah is
[47:48] listening this morning
[47:55] [Music]
[48:00] to come through uh some intense
[48:04] care
[48:05] [Music]
[48:15] and satan has been fighting her mind
[48:19] trying to put fear
[48:21] she's been feeling a few things
[48:23] [Music]
[48:24] but uh we just want her to be encouraged
[48:27] this morning
[48:30] so we want her to be encouraged
[48:42] well it is christmas time they say i
[48:44] don't see them
[48:46] now
[48:48] [Music]
[48:51] and i guess the world is
[48:55] having an exciting time
[49:02] but christmas means nothing
[49:05] if you don't have christ
[49:10] he's not in a manger in independence
[49:13] he's not on the cross
[49:16] hallelujah but he is alive and well may
[49:19] live yvonne
[49:22] and i trust that you have christ in your
[49:25] heart
[49:27] there is a manger it's your heart
[49:30] that's where christ ought to be tonight
[49:35] before i start my message
[49:38] we spoke on last service
[49:46] and i misquoted something uh there in
[49:49] that message
[49:51] i likened the uh souls under the altar
[49:55] in the sixth dimension
[50:02] and in reality brother branham never
[50:04] says where they are
[50:07] he said they were souls under the altar
[50:11] but the sixth dimension is mentioned
[50:13] therefore the bride of jesus christ
[50:18] and to explain that under the altar
[50:36] that the jews did not know jesus
[50:53] but it is separated from the sixth
[50:55] dimension
[50:58] because the sixth dimension muscular
[51:00] system is given to those who
[51:02] are blessed those who have
[51:06] received christ
[51:09] and under the altar is given to those
[51:11] jews
[51:13] who did not know jesus christ
[51:17] hallelujah is that all right in the
[51:20] bible
[51:21] we know by god's grace you cannot be
[51:24] in this land or the region of the
[51:26] blessed
[51:30] vengeance and the jews were
[51:34] under the altar saying how long lord
[51:37] will thou
[51:38] revenge us hallelujah
[51:42] so just to clarify that
[51:46] that those of us the true believers
[51:58] and from that dimension we ascended into
[52:00] the sixth dimension
[52:16] they're not in the sixth dimension
[52:19] so you figure it out and if you want to
[52:22] listen clearer
[52:23] listen more to that you can listen to it
[52:29] see how far brother branham took it
[52:32] okay let's get right into the word of
[52:34] god
[52:36] i hope that has been clarified
[52:39] by god's grace i appreciate our brother
[52:43] keith he brought that to mind
[52:46] and i really appreciate him doing that
[52:49] and anybody else who would do that
[52:53] which is your obligation
[52:56] and that's all good i appreciate it
[53:01] amen so let us stand and we'll go right
[53:03] into deuteronomy the 16th
[53:05] chapter
[53:08] and then from deuteronomy uh we'll go
[53:11] right into romans 8.
[53:27] amen he just went up two degrees as i
[53:29] can feel that too
[53:31] extra you love the lord amen we trust
[53:35] that those who are listening in my son
[53:37] called me and
[53:38] at the first we couldn't hear our
[53:40] brother uh samuel
[53:42] singing and i appreciate him calling to
[53:44] tell us that we need to revamp that we
[53:46] need to do something yeah
[53:48] and uh so i'm trusting the sound back
[53:51] to sound is responsible those who are
[53:53] listening
[53:55] and enjoy the message this morning
[53:58] not going to bring anything so deep but
[54:00] i want to say by god's grace
[54:03] but just by god's grace we're still
[54:06] dealing with the holies of holies
[54:09] it's so amazing that uh it's really
[54:12] simple you see
[54:13] sampler the gospel has never changed
[54:17] and everything that have come by way of
[54:19] the seals and the church ages it does
[54:21] give me
[54:30] [Music]
[54:48] [Music]
[54:57] and keep the passover unto the lord thy
[55:00] god
[55:01] for in the month of abib the lord thy
[55:05] god brought thee
[55:06] forth out of egypt by night observe the
[55:09] one day
[55:18] thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[55:20] passover unto the lord thy god
[55:22] of the flock and of the herb and in the
[55:26] place
[55:26] which the lord shall choose to place his
[55:30] name there
[55:32] jesus
[55:39] thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it
[55:43] seven days uh shall thou eat unleavened
[55:46] bread
[55:47] therewith even the bread of affliction
[55:50] for thou cameth forth out of the land of
[55:52] egypt
[55:53] in in haste that thou mayeth remember
[55:58] the day when thou came forth out of the
[56:01] land
[56:02] of egypt all the days of thy life
[56:39] and i trust that everybody knows that
[56:50] all right beginning at the first verse
[56:54] eighth chapter
[56:57] there is therefore
[57:01] no condemnation to them which are in
[57:04] christ jesus
[57:05] who walked not after the flesh but after
[57:08] the spirit
[57:10] meant no condemnation
[57:20] for the law of the spirit of life in
[57:22] christ
[57:24] excuse me for the law of the spirit of
[57:26] life in christ jesus
[57:28] have made me free from the law of sin
[57:31] and death.
[57:37] for what the law could not do in that it
[57:40] was weak through the flesh god sending
[57:44] his
[57:44] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[57:47] for sin
[57:48] condemn sin in the flesh god
[57:52] shows him
[58:02] that the righteousness of the law might
[58:04] be fulfilled in us
[58:06] who walk not after the flesh but after
[58:09] the spirit
[58:18] for they that are after the flesh do
[58:20] mind the things of the flesh
[58:23] but they that are after the spirit the
[58:25] things of the spirit
[58:34] for to be carnally minded is death but
[58:36] to be spiritually minded is life
[58:38] and peace
[58:45] because the kind of mind is enmity
[58:48] against god
[58:49] for it is not subject to the law of god
[58:52] neither indeed can be affection
[58:56] [Music]
[59:01] so then they that are are in the flesh
[59:05] cannot please god
[59:11] let us pray father god we come before
[59:14] you lord
[59:16] we thank you for your amazing grace
[59:19] lord you have been better to us than we
[59:23] have been to ourselves father we thank
[59:26] you
[59:26] this morning uh for all that you have
[59:29] done for us
[59:30] to scripture people you raised us up
[59:32] this morning
[59:34] and in our right mind we give you praise
[59:37] we give you honor
[59:39] we give you glory and we're asking thy
[59:41] name in
[59:42] the moment that you will take the word
[59:44] of god
[59:55] amen amen you may be seated
[59:58] who gives us
[1:00:12] and i'm sure that many of us
[1:00:17] believe that is the truth
[1:00:23] and perhaps many of us
[1:00:26] believe
[1:00:40] um
[1:00:54] there is no religion no
[1:00:58] building by the tumbler no clothing
[1:01:03] nothing can hide you from the word
[1:01:07] the bible tells us as a man thinketh in
[1:01:11] his heart
[1:01:12] um so is he
[1:01:15] sick we know by god's grace
[1:01:20] that this love that we are now sharing
[1:01:25] and fellowshipping around is
[1:01:28] elected love electivo
[1:01:33] it's because god loved us first
[1:01:50] by
[1:02:02] and we who are under this message
[1:02:07] message like we call we call the last
[1:02:09] day message
[1:02:11] there is not another message that's
[1:02:13] going to come up
[1:02:16] we have come to through the age of
[1:02:18] justification
[1:02:33] because justification makes room for
[1:02:36] sanctification
[1:02:38] makes room for the baptism of the holy
[1:02:41] ghost
[1:02:43] and the baptism of the holy ghost makes
[1:02:44] room for jesus christ
[1:02:49] we have been called to a perfect statue
[1:02:51] in christ
[1:02:54] we have been called to be part of his
[1:02:56] divine
[1:02:57] nature it is not
[1:03:01] something that you can do
[1:03:04] hallelujah it is once the seed of god is
[1:03:07] quickened in the inside
[1:03:10] of you god will then add to you
[1:03:14] is that right it's like a sea sicum
[1:03:17] insurmounts
[1:03:17] giving birth to life
[1:03:21] and then the nature
[1:03:24] allows it to grow
[1:03:27] you take some rain it takes some
[1:03:30] sunshine
[1:03:31] let's take some cold water it takes some
[1:03:34] heart
[1:03:35] it is a fourth season
[1:03:39] of growth we're not always
[1:03:42] on the top sometimes we find ourselves
[1:03:46] in the valley
[1:03:48] but at the same time um it is a place
[1:03:52] where the seed grow
[1:03:55] one thing we do know
[1:04:07] and the only way that you and i can be
[1:04:10] completely delivered
[1:04:13] we must come to know the deliverer
[1:04:18] as i have said many times
[1:04:21] god is more than words on a
[1:04:24] book in a book
[1:04:38] and you and i have been called out to
[1:04:40] meet him
[1:04:44] so we realized this morning
[1:04:48] brother said that word church
[1:04:52] um
[1:05:03] because a lot of times people think
[1:05:06] sanctification
[1:05:19] but if we were to go with that
[1:05:20] definition
[1:05:23] then many muslims are sanctified
[1:05:28] hallelujah many of the hindus are
[1:05:31] sanctified
[1:05:34] but that's not the sanctification that
[1:05:37] comes by the word of god
[1:05:40] hallelujah there was one element yeah
[1:05:43] only one element that could actually
[1:05:47] sanctify
[1:06:15] it was not water hallelujah
[1:06:19] it wasn't even fire
[1:06:23] it was the blood hallelujah
[1:06:26] so it doesn't matter how we reframe
[1:06:30] ourselves
[1:06:33] from doing wicked things the the shows
[1:06:36] of hallelujah
[1:06:37] that is not sanctification
[1:06:40] vacation is that something we're in the
[1:06:43] blood of
[1:06:44] jesus beginning to work
[1:06:47] in your life and begin to take those
[1:06:51] things
[1:06:52] away from you hallelujah
[1:06:55] this is not by your will
[1:06:58] come
[1:07:12] it comes by the blood of jesus
[1:07:16] christ i understand what i'm saying
[1:07:18] because if you say well
[1:07:20] i've been born in the message and i
[1:07:23] don't do this
[1:07:24] i don't do that i don't go here
[1:07:31] you're not sanctified until you accept
[1:07:34] the blood of jesus christ
[1:07:37] as the sanctifying agent
[1:07:42] hallelujah is that all right
[1:07:46] remember even in the
[1:07:50] old testament there were
[1:07:53] two covenants
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:36] and god gave the law to moses
[1:08:40] and israel israel not that the law
[1:08:44] helped them but the law only pointed out
[1:08:48] to them
[1:08:50] they were
[1:09:19] it's good hallelujah the law in itself
[1:09:24] right became a prison house
[1:09:29] hallelujah because nobody
[1:09:32] i said nobody person actually could live
[1:09:35] perfectly
[1:09:39] hallelujah in so much
[1:09:42] that they would be accepted by god
[1:09:46] the bible says all have sinned
[1:09:49] and come short of the glory of god
[1:09:52] there was only one man
[1:09:55] what man who was able to fulfill the law
[1:10:13] but he wants us to live right by his
[1:10:15] spirit
[1:10:19] we sing that song i used to go
[1:10:24] i don't go no more the things i used to
[1:10:28] do
[1:10:28] the show
[1:10:32] hallelujah but i don't do those things
[1:10:35] anymore because i don't have a desire
[1:10:39] to do those things anymore
[1:10:42] because the light has come here and has
[1:10:45] dispelled
[1:10:46] the darkness in my life
[1:10:50] hallelujah y'all know what i'm saying
[1:10:53] says it like this exactly when a man is
[1:10:56] thrown away
[1:11:01] he's thrown away of his own lust
[1:11:05] hallelujah
[1:11:09] hallelujah but james says it like this
[1:11:12] exactly
[1:11:12] if you get rid of the darkness
[1:11:16] you won't have a temptation
[1:11:20] y'all know what i'm saying if there is
[1:11:22] no darkness there i don't see that there
[1:11:24] is nothing
[1:11:34] but only god can get rid of the darkness
[1:12:20] hallelujah
[1:12:29] so therefore i know the transgression of
[1:12:32] the law
[1:12:33] is sin the transgression
[1:12:41] so therefore until god made them a law
[1:12:46] there was no transgression reckoned to
[1:12:48] them
[1:13:02] i wish you could get that let me say it
[1:13:04] again
[1:13:05] so that you could understand that here
[1:13:08] it was
[1:13:10] you see at a time when there was no law
[1:13:14] came by the way of moses
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:31] so where does that bring you hello
[1:13:34] there is now no condemnation
[1:13:39] to those who sir
[1:13:43] hallelujah
[1:13:58] there is
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:08] here that says you can can't turn over
[1:14:10] 20 miles
[1:14:39] and to transgress god's law
[1:14:46] but there was no salvation in the law
[1:14:50] what i'm saying that means when the law
[1:14:53] was given
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:05] so you can see that even during the time
[1:15:07] of the lord
[1:15:14] amen without the shedding of blood
[1:15:17] without the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:30] because if you put your trust in
[1:15:32] anything outside of the blood of jesus
[1:15:36] christ
[1:15:59] and these two laws deuteronomy
[1:16:04] there was two laws one law of death
[1:16:08] and the other one the law of life
[1:16:11] belongs to the lord
[1:16:13] see what i'm saying and not jesus christ
[1:16:16] it's jesus because he died and rose
[1:16:32] oh
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:37] when this message has become common to
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:41] i've never fully understood
[1:17:52] but i know one thing that when when it
[1:17:54] comes to
[1:17:56] revelations
[1:18:10] is
[1:18:23] amen amen one of them was given to adam
[1:18:26] let me
[1:18:26] see and there was also two covenants
[1:18:30] give to the people he said we're going
[1:18:33] to speak of them in the morning
[1:18:36] one of them was given to adam on
[1:18:38] condition
[1:18:50] and god made a second covenant think
[1:18:53] and give them abraham and that law was
[1:18:57] unconditional
[1:18:59] hallelujah amen why did why did he give
[1:19:02] us an unconditional covenant
[1:19:05] god recognized
[1:19:20] why did you come
[1:19:32] is there something that's going on in
[1:19:34] you that you know you say well
[1:19:36] brother you know i i put it this way
[1:19:39] as a as a shepherd i can see things you
[1:19:42] can't see
[1:19:44] and as a shepherd i stand here trying to
[1:19:46] help yeah
[1:20:16] it's just
[1:20:26] and that law was unconditional is it
[1:20:28] like it isn't what you've
[1:20:30] done
[1:20:38] because if that's the way you believe it
[1:20:39] it also brings you joy
[1:20:44] be free
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:56] that you have truly made jesus christ
[1:21:13] hallelujah romans 10 9 is still
[1:21:16] in the bible moment and how many of you
[1:21:19] have accepted the lord jesus christ
[1:21:21] into your heart and confessed him with
[1:21:24] yourself
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:54] how are we going to get through the holy
[1:21:57] place
[1:22:02] revelation of what sanctification

[1:22:51] allow things to
[1:22:52] happen to us
[1:22:55] you're not in control
[1:22:59] and you know where i took her famous

[1:23:20] powerful
[1:23:26] hallelujah and a shepherd is a herder of
[1:23:29] sheep
[1:23:31] so when i say the lord is my
[1:23:46] that means he's going to be my supplier
[1:23:50] he's my jehovah he is my supplier
[1:23:54] i shall not walk
[1:23:58] [Music]

[1:24:28] working
[1:24:42] delivered from this i need to be
[1:24:45] delivered from there
[1:24:47] and then god takes it away
[1:24:51] that's what i get you know what what
[1:24:52] surprises me about it

[1:25:09] have done it myself

[1:30:39] father
[1:30:40] by him

[1:31:14] it can become a system hallelujah
[1:31:18] like the baptist come the methodists
[1:31:23] and even in the message
[1:31:28] hallelujah but that's not what god
[1:31:31] wants to do hallelujah is that right
[1:31:35] in god's provided place of worship
[1:31:40] a denomination will
[1:32:10] i hear this all the time but if you get
[1:32:12] it right then god won't have to preach
[1:32:14] it
[1:32:19] you know people say well if you talk
[1:32:20] about me once again i ain't coming back
[1:32:22] well you're not hurting me
[1:32:24] you're

[1:32:33] last days
[1:32:34] am i supposed to be moved it's just you
[1:32:36] surprised
[1:32:38] paul said none
[1:32:48] so i got to make sure it comes straight
[1:33:02] amen we come to church so that we can
[1:33:05] examine ourselves
[1:33:16] and by the time you get out the door
[1:33:28] amen and yet god is trying to give you
[1:33:30] medicine for your soul
[1:33:33] come up with somebody brother i'll say
[1:33:34] you got
[1:33:48] i've seen that before hallelujah
[1:33:52] no but if you really into the game
[1:33:55] what i'm talking about when you listen
[1:33:57] to the football when you look
[1:33:58] when you watch the football game
[1:34:01] hallelujah
[1:34:01] even when the quarterback go like that

[1:34:05] you're in your seat going like that you
[1:34:07] know
[1:34:09] one hallelujah when the man runs and
[1:34:13] you know you're out of your seat now
[1:34:15] he's now at the five yards out
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:30] can't hear you but you're screaming
[1:34:33] maybe that's great is that the truth
[1:34:37] it's the same with soccer you don't know
[1:34:40] what i'm talking about when it comes to
[1:34:41] the following i love soccer but you know
[1:34:44] you're kicking that ball
[1:34:46] you know now y'all look at my footwork
[1:34:48] y'all might think i know what i'm doing
[1:34:49] but i don't know
[1:34:52] yeah but the truth of the matter is amen
[1:34:54] when that guy
[1:34:55] kicked that ball and everything you know
[1:35:12] that's
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:26] and if you feel like you're not there
[1:35:30] you can always cry out like blind bottom
[1:35:32] hairs
[1:35:38] now also quoting from the choosing of
[1:35:41] god's uh
[1:35:42] place in place
[1:35:46] now so he has chosen for his worshipers
[1:35:51] i'm sorry he claimed
[1:35:54] he would put his
[1:36:20] no matter what time of the season it was
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:50] i don't
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:37:02] where is that place i don't see it
[1:37:17] the only place of worship listener jesus
[1:37:21] christ how many of us can say we know
[1:37:24] him
[1:37:26] so hypocritical let me stop we'll get
[1:37:29] out there
[1:37:46] hypocrisy
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:38:11] and the great unchanging god is
[1:38:31] all i got to do is uh let you open your
[1:38:33] mouth one time
[1:38:36] what's going to come out of your mouth
[1:38:41] right i don't like it
[1:38:56] my church
[1:39:31] and when you get like that it looks good
[1:39:33] that's reporting you got to have some
[1:39:34] church service somewhere
[1:39:38] you got to have some hallelujahs anyhow
[1:39:42] thank you jesus anyhow y'all hear what
[1:39:44] i'm saying
[1:39:45] no matter what comes there's something
[1:39:48] going on
[1:39:48] in the heart at all
[1:39:52] you know discourage who
[1:39:55] says i get weary in my flesh
[1:39:59] discouragement doesn't come easy
[1:40:04] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:40:07] because every time satan tries to
[1:40:09] discourage me
[1:40:11] i've got some angels working with him
[1:40:16] did you know that the angels are still
[1:40:18] with you
[1:40:19] even when you don't
[1:40:34] is
[1:40:44] [Music]
[1:40:48] um your neighbors don't have to talk
[1:40:51] about you
[1:40:54] because the angels are talking about
[1:40:58] that was a good one that's fresh
[1:41:02] and the great unchanging god cannot
[1:41:04] change
[1:41:07] man changes
[1:41:11] is that all right surely if god said i
[1:41:14] don't
[1:41:15] he would put his name in this place
[1:41:59] man it's god holy ghost
[1:42:02] himself hallelujah
[1:42:06] but you can put your life up excuse me
[1:42:10] and the great unchanging god
[1:42:16] but you can put your life upon anything
[1:42:19] that god ever said at any time
[1:42:27] because it is the truth
[1:42:32] because that's the only thing i can have
[1:42:34] confidence in
[1:42:37] the bible now how can that be
[1:42:42] the prophet said that's the only thing
[1:42:44] you have confidence in the prophet
[1:42:46] and many of us don't even read our
[1:42:47] bibles
[1:42:52] was that meant for a rebuke oh
[1:43:02] and everybody don't have the revelation
[1:43:03] of jesus christ
[1:43:36] is
[1:43:48] he gave them power
[1:44:07] it's a disgrace see like this gospel for
[1:44:09] men to say i'm christian
[1:44:12] you say i'm christian you've got no
[1:44:15] power
[1:44:19] it is a disgraceful thing scene shows up
[1:44:22] disgusting it's like samson song
[1:44:26] being being defeated by by the
[1:44:28] philistines
[1:44:31] hallelujah man y'all help my brother if
[1:44:34] he's saying it wrong say it right
[1:44:37] so you know the truth of the matter is
[1:44:40] look
[1:44:41] when we come down the road that's good
[1:44:43] news i want some stress
[1:44:44] and a man say i am a christian
[1:44:55] because the bible says you shall receive
[1:45:00] power
[1:45:13] all the tabernacles are all the wood
[1:45:19] everything in the tabernacle everything
[1:45:22] type christ
[1:45:25] all the laws everything was in type of
[1:45:28] crime
[1:45:30] is that right we've been through it time
[1:45:33] and time after gain is that all right
[1:45:35] then we see that every creed
[1:45:39] the sacrifice and denomination is left
[1:45:42] far
[1:45:56] it's completely
[1:46:10] oh
[1:46:24] i get excited because i realize
[1:46:30] there's a lot of people in the message
[1:46:31] that still needs to be saved
[1:46:41] just don't want nobody to come up short
[1:46:48] you know the scripture says in the
[1:46:50] presence of the lord
[1:46:52] there
[1:46:57] you know something about joy that makes
[1:46:59] your face changes
[1:47:03] it puts a smile on your face it doesn't
[1:47:06] it doesn't put
[1:47:07] this little this angry look this mad
[1:47:09] look on your face like you better you're
[1:47:10] ready to whoop somebody
[1:47:13] figure i don't even know how y'all look
[1:47:15] but i'm telling you
[1:47:16] something's going on and it ain't the
[1:47:18] holy ghost
[1:47:41] that's why god told ezekiel don't look
[1:47:43] at their faces
[1:47:46] saying to the rook
[1:48:59] undisturbed faith
[1:49:03] faith in the bible what is that
[1:49:07] that's jesus christ him personally
[1:49:11] as a shepherd in your life

[1:50:59] while

[2:02:20] without purpose son is on objective
[2:02:27] second corinthians the third chapter
[2:02:30] the second
[2:02:45] for as much as you are manifestly
[2:02:47] declared to be the epistles of christ
[2:02:49] ministered by us written not with
[2:02:52] ink but with the spirit of the living
[2:02:54] god
[2:02:55] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[2:02:58] tables of the heart was it manifested
[2:03:11] in in in in short
[2:03:15] we can say whatever we want to say
[2:03:19] we can claim to be the bride of christ
[2:03:24] the catholic church claims to be the
[2:03:26] same
[2:04:33] it wasn't something he claimed
