[33:39] stand in honor of the word we stand
[33:44] we'll be ready to read the word because
[33:46] we believe that the word lives I'm gonna
[33:51] try to finish up tonight on the thought
[33:54] this book called the Bible what's in the
[33:58] book tonight I want to work with the
[34:02] thought on purpose God had a purpose and
[34:08] I'm so glad tonight to be part of that
[34:11] purpose so as we stand let us read from
[34:17] st. John the first chapter but also read
[34:22] from Genesis 1 st. John the first
[34:25] chapter we read one through five and
[34:29] then Genesis 1:1 glad to see everybody
[34:36] out here tonight so many people they
[34:40] don't know how to worship God they
[34:41] ashamed sometime because we've been
[34:45] taught that the devil can have all the
[34:48] fun when it's worship time you go some
[34:51] of these games they pick up each other
[34:52] and throw each other in there but when
[34:55] it comes to God you're supposed to sit
[34:57] quiet
[34:57] that's nonsense the Bible says let
[35:00] everything that hath breath praise the
[35:01] Lord Amen God loves a joyful noise you
[35:07] know what you know like I always tell
[35:09] you if the Lord should take me and I go
[35:11] home
[35:12] don't come near singing near my god too
[35:14] deep ain't near him I'm in here so you
[35:18] know when y'all come to my funeral if
[35:20] you do bring all your instruments and I
[35:22] want y'all to praise and worship God if
[35:26] you don't do it I might get up
[35:27] [Laughter]
[35:31] hallelujah don't be moaning over me
[35:33] because I'm gonna be having a good time
[35:34] if y'all
[35:35] if you don't general st. John one began
[35:39] at beginning in the beginning was the
[35:41] word and the Word was with God and the
[35:43] Word was God the same was in the
[35:46] beginning with God all things were made
[35:48] by him and without him was not anything
[35:51] made that was made in him was life and
[35:54] the life was the light of men and the
[36:00] light shine earth and darkness and the
[36:02] darkness comprehended it not that's a
[36:04] good thought light shining in darkness
[36:07] and the darkness comprehended it not
[36:10] Genesis 1 was just going to read that
[36:12] first verse Genesis 1 in the beginning
[36:16] God created the heavens they heaven and
[36:20] the earth
[36:21] let us pray our Heavenly Father we thank
[36:24] you for your grace and your mercy we
[36:27] thank you for being so good to us
[36:28] you have been better to us Lord than
[36:30] we've been to ourselves and we love you
[36:33] Lord Jesus with all our hearts Lord
[36:36] we're not perfect within ourselves but
[36:38] because of your amazing grace you have
[36:40] made us perfect thank you father God we
[36:43] just pray Lord that you bless each and
[36:45] every heart tonight may we all go out of
[36:48] this place feeling closer to you than we
[36:51] did when we first come in bless us now
[36:53] in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[36:56] amen you may be seated I want I want to
[37:01] say tonight that you know we look at
[37:03] this Bible like I said last service when
[37:06] we talk about this Bible this Bible have
[37:08] been they've tried to destroy this Bible
[37:11] for thousands of years now amen and and
[37:15] you know no matter how they tried to
[37:16] kill it or they can't but the Bible said
[37:20] in the beginning was the word and the
[37:21] Word was with God and the Word was God
[37:23] it is God now it is God letter form now
[37:27] you can burn this Bible but could and
[37:29] destroy it but you can never destroy God
[37:31] because the Bible tells us that God is a
[37:34] spirit hallelujah so you can understand
[37:38] what I'm saying before there ever was
[37:40] anything there was God
[37:42] we call him by God's grace elohim LOLOL
[37:47] him he is the self-existing one you
[37:51] understand me
[37:52] so what do you mean what I'm trying to
[37:54] say is that very air that you're
[37:55] breathing God created it but God doesn't
[37:58] need air to breathe because if God
[38:01] needed the air to breathe then the air
[38:03] becomes God because the air becomes
[38:05] greater than God you see so God Amen is
[38:09] a spirit God doesn't need food
[38:14] hallelujah to survive he existed and
[38:19] none of us knows how it all happened we
[38:23] can't even comprehend it in our minds
[38:25] because we have always known beginnings
[38:28] and endings is that right first and last
[38:33] but God was here when nothing else was
[38:36] here matter of fact he created nothing a
[38:42] man because when God was everywhere he
[38:47] was a spirit of attributes right he was
[38:52] a spirit he's an intelligent being the
[38:53] most intelligent ever there's no one
[38:55] else that is greater than he matter of
[38:58] fact in the book of Isaiah said if there
[38:59] be another god he says I don't know him
[39:01] he taught Israel Israel know that the
[39:05] LORD thy God he is one there's only one
[39:08] God and you know we thought we know that
[39:11] theologians have cut him up in all kinds
[39:12] of pieces and everything else but let me
[39:15] say it like this
[39:17] who will you believe the Bible or the
[39:22] man the Bible said know ye know ye this
[39:26] Israel the Lord thy God is one amen so
[39:31] there's something you said what do you
[39:33] mean like I was telling you we have come
[39:36] in a time where and this is an
[39:38] intellectual age everybody is smart
[39:40] you know except me you know but
[39:43] everybody is smart everybody you know
[39:46] your education is rapid and you're
[39:48] really stupid if you don't go to school
[39:49] that's what they say but I find out that
[39:52] the people that didn't go to school was
[39:54] the ones that were closest to God
[39:56] hallelujah no I know is that it doesn't
[39:59] give an account of Noah ever going to
[40:02] going to school but he was smart enough
[40:04] to build an hour hallelujah
[40:07] why because he was in tune with the
[40:11] Creator right and you and I every one of
[40:15] us have been made in the image and
[40:16] likeness of God and in our minds we are
[40:22] creators you take a child you don't have
[40:25] to tell him how to try to create little
[40:27] things little dirt heels and all that
[40:28] he's always there trying to fashion
[40:31] something according to what he's seeing
[40:33] in his mind why he's born like that he's
[40:36] in that image right out of all the
[40:39] animals we are that most intelligent
[40:41] ones why because we're more than just an
[40:43] animal
[40:44] and not Eve fallen Adam fell we wouldn't
[40:48] be part animal in part God
[40:53] but because of their fall we became more
[40:57] like the animal because of them we died
[41:02] because of what they did but you see we
[41:05] have seen by God me so what what do you
[41:07] mean brother understand there's a
[41:08] purpose and what is a purpose a person a
[41:12] purpose is the reason for which
[41:14] something exists you think God just
[41:16] created all this like some people think
[41:18] he created all of this and just left it
[41:21] alone
[41:21] let's see how it grows no he had a
[41:25] purpose God is a God of order right he
[41:30] could have just brought everything
[41:31] together like something painters and
[41:33] artists now they don't care how they do
[41:35] it they just did this name whatever goes
[41:38] on there you find this critic comes out
[41:40] that it's so glorious it's a mess but it
[41:45] shows the intelligence of a man you know
[41:48] everything that's disarrayed and
[41:49] disordered orderly I think it's
[41:51] beautiful
[41:52] but you find out that when we when we
[41:55] look at this book every answer to your
[41:58] questions are right here in this book
[42:01] Amen God tells us why he made man he
[42:07] didn't have
[42:07] - but he did he had animals he had he
[42:11] had seraphim's he had cherubims he had
[42:13] he was God before we came into existence
[42:17] now we were always with him is that
[42:21] right
[42:22] she in reality it doesn't matter nothing
[42:26] is completely annihilated everything
[42:30] when it's done away with go back to what
[42:32] it used to be before it became a
[42:34] substance so you and I know that you
[42:37] never ever completely annihilate your
[42:40] consciousness and everything else may be
[42:41] broke down into whatever it was before
[42:44] it came to being but you know you and I
[42:47] go back why are you saying all these
[42:49] things brother books because God is God
[42:52] and he can't lose nothing
[42:58] everything God had in the beginning of
[43:01] it from the beginning however you want
[43:02] to say it will always be God's it goes
[43:05] back to where it came from
[43:07] now we look at this thing is or why
[43:10] Genesis brother Bruce because there in
[43:12] Genesis 1:27 we find that God said let
[43:14] us make man in our image Genesis 1:27
[43:18] and people don't understand that they
[43:19] said well well what is he doing in
[43:21] Genesis 2 21 and 22 the Bible said you
[43:24] know because you and I must understand
[43:26] God is a spirit so first of all God
[43:29] created the first Adam spirit is that
[43:34] right
[43:34] sure he did you could even in the word
[43:36] if it ain't the words you don't have
[43:38] very minute you know and people don't
[43:42] understand how that God comes along and
[43:45] I was saying like this when it comes to
[43:48] preaching I had to do it the way God
[43:49] gives it to me I'm not a parent and you
[43:55] come along and you
[43:56] find out the people we find out that
[43:57] here God comes along and he creates a
[44:00] man and now you can't even see him
[44:02] because he is spirit hallelujah
[44:06] he's Adam and we find out to a man that
[44:11] Adam basically led the animals just like
[44:14] the Holy Ghost leads you you ever seen
[44:17] him yet the Holy Ghost but you know him
[44:19] you know his feelings you know his
[44:22] presence when he's there is that right
[44:25] but then God was what was he doing here
[44:28] the purpose he's a he's easy all like
[44:30] Tahiti Elohim he's God and think about
[44:34] it God condescending into his creation
[44:39] just for fellowship he was a self
[44:43] existing one but in him was all
[44:46] attributes Oh every tree that ever lived
[44:50] was in God hallelujah everything
[44:54] everything was in him and by God's
[44:57] creation what did he do he brought it
[44:59] out y'all believe that and you said what
[45:03] do you what do you what are you getting
[45:05] here answers in the book where am I she
[45:09] laid purpose for your birth into this
[45:12] dimension is that you would become a son
[45:16] of God and worship Him it doesn't matter
[45:19] how great your achievements on this
[45:21] world if you don't become a Christian
[45:24] knowing the Lord Jesus you have missed
[45:27] the purpose for which you were born
[45:31] million people miss it they think Oh God
[45:33] meant me to ride to the moon well you go
[45:37] to the moon what you're gonna find there
[45:39] and you know the things that gets me is
[45:42] all all the solutions to our problems
[45:45] are right there and Solomon Solomon said
[45:47] listen I tried everything and everything
[45:51] I have found vanity he said here's the
[45:55] conclusion of the matter fear God and
[45:57] keep his Commandments
[45:59] hallelujah why are you saying that
[46:01] because you're gonna die in this body
[46:05] you're going to die and where are you
[46:07] going
[46:08] here's where you
[46:09] did you're done don't you believe that I
[46:12] was in a world called my mama for nine
[46:16] months hallelujah
[46:18] I knew nothing about this world now
[46:21] where I was before that I was in my
[46:23] daddy's lords hallelujah
[46:27] my daddy transferred me into my mama
[46:29] hallelujah she had the barren ground and
[46:32] all of a sudden I began to grow arms
[46:34] legs ears and all these things in this
[46:36] wound I grew eyes and nose and the mouth
[46:39] and all these things I didn't need none
[46:42] of that not in my room in my mom's
[46:45] whoo-ha
[46:46] she said me she walked and so for me she
[46:51] did everything for me all I did was
[46:54] relaxed and have a good time
[46:55] get a few kicks every now and then you
[46:58] know hey man turn turn a little
[47:01] somersault every now and again
[47:02] y'all know but nevertheless I was in my
[47:04] own world and it was comfortable
[47:08] hallelujah but nature has a way of
[47:11] pushing you into something cuz you know
[47:16] and being living beings we're lazy we
[47:20] can be lazy and sometimes you know it is
[47:22] true you know you find no winners or win
[47:25] witness baby coming witness baby coming
[47:27] you know some babies are right at nine
[47:29] months and some babies are gonna hold on
[47:32] to ten and you find out by the God's
[47:36] grace God has to help one thing I love
[47:41] about babies normal babies are born in a
[47:45] prayer position they come
[47:53] down they come out looking at the dust
[47:56] from which they came as a testimony of
[48:02] God right you have the blood you have
[48:05] the water you have the spirit you have
[48:08] justification sanctification the baptism
[48:10] of the Holy Ghost
[48:11] hallelujah you say oh I got a baby you
[48:14] don't have a baby until that baby
[48:17] breathes on his own and you don't have a
[48:21] true son of God until he breathes about
[48:24] breeze the breath of life in here now
[48:28] let me go on the CDs and I'm off a
[48:30] little bit so you understand that what
[48:32] God did he created him spiritual and
[48:34] then he formed him out of the dust of
[48:36] the ground right to creation of one man
[48:41] that's why we're body soul and spirit
[48:45] hallelujah but I said all of that to say
[48:49] because of sin you and I in art we let
[48:54] me ask you a question how did you get
[48:55] here the normal way of getting into this
[48:58] world is by birth you're born into this
[49:01] world you didn't come by a fire and
[49:03] salsa or do you know any kind of being
[49:06] you came by birth right in order to get
[49:10] into the kingdom of God you come by
[49:12] birth see it ain't nothing you can do
[49:16] about it it's God quickening the seed in
[49:19] you and that she brings forth his life
[49:22] she the purpose was this is the this is
[49:26] the mystery of Genesis because when God
[49:28] created Adam and Eve he created Adam
[49:30] right and nobody knew nothing about II
[49:32] like I said yesterday the last time I
[49:34] preached the mystery of Adam was easy
[49:37] hallelujah and the mystery of God was
[49:40] that he had a feminine part the Bible
[49:43] calls him el shadi I which is breasted
[49:45] one hallelujah male and female now
[49:50] that's a little bit of that's a little
[49:52] bit of something there but my point is
[49:54] you know if you take the natural and
[49:56] look at the spiritual every living
[49:58] creature had male female male female
[50:00] male female right every man took a wife
[50:04] every man took a wife and
[50:07] that's what God said be fruitful and
[50:09] multiply how Adam by himself was gonna
[50:12] do it
[50:13] hallelujah now you and I know by God's
[50:16] grace that II came out of Adam because
[50:19] she was there all the time
[50:23] hallelujah and he did not take up some
[50:25] other kind of dirt the Bible said he
[50:27] took a part of her real and formed her a
[50:31] feminine body right but she hadn't was
[50:36] Adam look at Genesis 5:1 the Bible's the
[50:39] generation of Adam the Bible said that
[50:41] when God made Adam he made them male and
[50:45] female and called their t-80 our name
[50:50] Adam so both had the same name that's
[50:56] the valuable see the answer is in the
[50:58] book and the problem was is that Adam
[51:01] and Eve was separated and he did some
[51:04] things she shouldn't have done
[51:05] hallelujah and what did she do with that
[51:08] she brought forth two kinds of people
[51:11] all right y'all know the story of Cain
[51:14] and Abel and Cain and Abel a man came
[51:21] from the same room but there were two
[51:23] seeds two different seeds one was a
[51:27] murderer and the other one was after
[51:29] after Adam it's in there but I'm not
[51:32] gonna dwell on that my point is there
[51:35] was a purpose what was the purpose what
[51:38] was the purpose let's go back let's go
[51:41] back before we knew anything before Adam
[51:45] and Eve was planted we find out that
[51:48] there was a war in heaven y'all remember
[51:51] that there's a war in heaven and Lucifer
[51:55] rebelled against God Ezekiel I believe
[51:59] it says you have said in your heart is
[52:01] that easy good yeah you're my one of the
[52:04] two you said in your heart and there you
[52:06] have said in your heart I will excel
[52:10] excel above the throne of God our cause
[52:13] the stars of God to worship me did he do
[52:17] it
[52:18] oh come on
[52:20] the whole plan was to absolutely cause
[52:24] the true sons of God to worship Him but
[52:28] he couldn't do it not in the original so
[52:32] he had to slip in something that could
[52:34] produce another kind of seed in the
[52:37] image and likeness of God but totally
[52:40] not God y'all hit me so that he could
[52:43] find somebody to worship Him and that's
[52:48] what we're living in today people we're
[52:50] living in a world where you got two
[52:53] kinds of people you got a people that
[52:56] will be of God and other people that
[52:58] will be of the devil that's it and you
[53:05] said well what do you mean you know
[53:07] that's that's why the Bible said that in
[53:09] the book of Genesis there was a God
[53:10] there was a tree of the knowledge of
[53:12] good and evil and there was a tree of
[53:15] life so two trees was in there with had
[53:18] two purposes different purposes right
[53:21] the tree of life can only give you life
[53:24] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[53:26] is giving us what we got today you say
[53:30] well what do you have brother Brooks
[53:32] I've got an automobile that's good and
[53:34] evil some of us got guns that is good
[53:38] and evil some of us know doctors that
[53:42] are good and evil see there's nothing
[53:45] that you cannot do good or evil because
[53:47] we're subject to it because of the fall
[53:50] we're subject to it right and so many
[53:54] people ask the question they said well
[53:55] what did God mean when he says we let us
[53:59] it's in the Bible is in this book so we
[54:04] come along and we find ourselves in our
[54:07] 20:18 who is not Lord look at all of the
[54:09] stuff that's going on in the world
[54:11] is it not in here it was prophesied that
[54:15] this was going to be this way how many
[54:17] y'all believe in prophecy see the truth
[54:20] of the matter is it is and my thing is
[54:22] it doesn't matter it's like when Noah
[54:24] said it's gonna rain for 120 years it's
[54:27] gonna rain see it doesn't matter whether
[54:29] you believe it or not if God said it
[54:30] it's gonna happen
[54:33] hallelujah when the Angels went down to
[54:36] Sodom and said hey it's going to rain
[54:37] fire brimstone
[54:39] we've never seen such a thing before
[54:41] I've got my summer house I got my winter
[54:44] house I got everything I need hallelujah
[54:47] but the scientists said we've not seen
[54:50] them like that but they had never seen
[54:52] rain before either but a rain
[54:54] I always task people this I said well
[54:56] let me ask you something get more didn't
[54:58] know a drag that our couple on Mount
[55:02] Everest how did that all get up on Mount
[55:05] Everest it's a witness it's a true fact
[55:07] that they have discovered the Ark of God
[55:10] Moses knows Noah's Ark amount ever Eric
[55:14] how did it get up there the flood in
[55:22] almost every nation no matter how
[55:24] primitive it's been they have an account
[55:27] of the flood even the American Indians
[55:31] had account of the flood you know but
[55:34] God don't need a witnesses such I heard
[55:37] somebody say well you know you know give
[55:39] me you got to give me proof but the
[55:42] truth of the matter is you ever thought
[55:46] about this how Moses wrote almost all of
[55:49] the Old Testament
[55:51] how did Moses write Genesis what do you
[55:56] then y'all understand me well he was a
[56:01] prophet and the Bible said that the word
[56:03] of the Lord comes to what a prophet God
[56:07] says in Amos 3:7 I will do nothing
[56:09] except I show it to my prophets first so
[56:13] he's a warning he's a neck he's an alarm
[56:16] he's a he's and you know it's just what
[56:19] people don't understand we are at a time
[56:21] right now this world is getting ready to
[56:24] crumble
[56:26] hello let me let me use an
[56:30] illustration and then I'll move on move
[56:33] on what am I trying to say you have a
[56:36] purpose here every one of us that's been
[56:39] born we have a purpose not only just to
[56:43] be a Christian but to to do what God has
[56:45] purpose in our hearts to do it is his
[56:48] mind for us to do right now you show a
[56:52] brother like you don't have to be a
[56:53] great man you know I think about that
[56:58] little feller that gave them a few fish
[56:59] and loaves of bread y'all for me with
[57:02] that story gave the fish and loaves of
[57:03] bread and that's all he had to do
[57:07] hallelujah
[57:08] and I think about Amen that woman a man
[57:11] who had only there's two pence amen and
[57:13] she put it in the service that's all she
[57:15] had to do she was created just for that
[57:19] nothing more nothing less and no one
[57:23] else could have done her job hallelujah
[57:27] we're serving a living God if we could
[57:30] get just like I was telling somebody the
[57:32] other day and I I'll put some scripture
[57:33] in just a minute
[57:34] I was saying to people other guys said
[57:36] the hardest thing for us Christians to
[57:38] do is to get people to believe that
[57:40] there is a God and Jesus Christ is the
[57:43] one they ought to be serving why because
[57:51] you got two kinds of people have you
[57:58] ever met people that's so evil and they
[57:59] don't even care they don't feel a
[58:02] remorse they can do whatever they want
[58:04] to do and say whatever they want to say
[58:07] and never regret nothing
[58:09] don't ever apologize nothing like that
[58:12] that's something dark they're right and
[58:17] it doesn't always have to be that kind
[58:19] of a person it could be a real religious
[58:21] person but you see when God is in a
[58:26] man's heart he acts like God oh I'm so
[58:31] glad I got a few aliens in here we are
[58:37] call is your Brotherhood isn't just that
[58:40] crazy are you crazy let me say it like
[58:42] this everything I'm saying I could prove
[58:44] by the scripture if you believe the
[58:45] scripture I can show you my point is
[58:48] this we have not been called to be a
[58:51] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian message
[58:56] helicopter we've been called to do none
[58:59] of that we have been called to be sons
[59:02] and daughters of God and every
[59:05] organization got somebody there
[59:07] representing God and you don't have to
[59:10] believe it but it's true
[59:12] that's why the Bible said come out of
[59:15] her my people hallelujah there they must
[59:18] be in there in order to come out huh
[59:21] because God did not want us trusting in
[59:24] an organization he don't want us
[59:27] trusting a man in a man-made system he
[59:31] wants us to trust in him is that right
[59:34] David said Lord I put my trust in you
[59:40] we're not against our people or anything
[59:44] like that but it is systems that keeps
[59:46] us apart is that right if I was headed
[59:51] when a house is divided it cannot stand
[59:55] and Christians everywhere won't stand
[59:59] because they got a little difference
[1:00:02] that's nonsense
[1:00:04] I got eight children and they all
[1:00:06] different but they're mine if that makes
[1:00:13] it and you see these things you said all
[1:00:17] problems what are you saying she in
[1:00:18] order for us to see the move of God like
[1:00:20] he's hallelujah like he said he was
[1:00:23] gonna do in this last day we must shed
[1:00:25] all this nonsense and get right back to
[1:00:29] the Word of God hallelujah
[1:00:38] the revelation of Jesus Christ he said
[1:00:40] the holy man is Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:00:43] is in us how dare the how Arkadiy clear
[1:00:46] that the laity has no word to say each
[1:00:49] one has something to say each one has a
[1:00:51] work each one has a ministry everybody
[1:00:54] in here has a ministry in a work it
[1:00:57] ain't all about the pastor hallelujah is
[1:01:01] that right it's not just about me it's
[1:01:04] about all of us and we all play a part
[1:01:07] this is what I love about communion you
[1:01:11] know I'm jumping here but communion
[1:01:14] means a lot to me because communion take
[1:01:17] one bread and he breaks it all up and
[1:01:20] gives it to each individual right and
[1:01:24] the scriptures say don't leave none you
[1:01:26] got to eat it all but let's put it let's
[1:01:30] rewind this thing if we take those
[1:01:33] fragments of bread and we put them ball
[1:01:36] back together
[1:01:36] what do you call that unity because
[1:01:42] we're made out of the same system
[1:01:44] substance we made out of the same bread
[1:01:46] we just got pieces that's what he tried
[1:01:49] to teach his disciples I am the bread
[1:01:52] but when I'm broken on Calvary I'm gonna
[1:01:56] give you a piece of me you're a piece of
[1:01:57] me your piece of me and understand it's
[1:02:00] the same bread than all of your eating
[1:02:03] and so therefore you should be united in
[1:02:05] the spirit but we so religious we take
[1:02:13] it like some sacrament or something like
[1:02:14] that and we we missed the whole
[1:02:17] reverence of it we missed the whole
[1:02:19] revelation of it this is why Christians
[1:02:22] are not supposed to take it
[1:02:23] unworthily because we must respect one
[1:02:26] another hallelujah he's my brother I
[1:02:30] don't know about that brother he you
[1:02:32] know he's got problems who doesn't have
[1:02:34] problems you raise your hand and you
[1:02:37] know what i'ma call you know what you
[1:02:41] lie if you see you not having troubles
[1:02:44] is this okay
[1:02:46] what Jesus Christ is the only potentate
[1:02:50] you say how did it
[1:02:52] Jesus Christ why is it not God the
[1:02:54] Father or God the Son of God the Holy
[1:02:56] Ghost because you got to understand the
[1:02:57] Bible said the fullness of God the
[1:02:59] fullness of God dwelt in Jesus right and
[1:03:02] if you understand that if there's a
[1:03:05] minor revelation I'm not here to try to
[1:03:06] give you no revelation but I'm trying to
[1:03:08] tell you if G if God put himself into
[1:03:11] this body then what do I become to you
[1:03:14] right and that's what God did God put
[1:03:17] himself in Jesus right and in John 10:30
[1:03:22] he says I and the father are one
[1:03:24] you don't have to break it down just
[1:03:26] believe it hallelujah the Bible says
[1:03:29] neither salvation in any other that's
[1:03:32] that's that's the book of Acts neither
[1:03:35] is there salvation in any other but
[1:03:37] there is no other name given among men
[1:03:39] whereby we must be saved and it doesn't
[1:03:42] matter what the theologians say it
[1:03:44] doesn't matter I don't care how many
[1:03:45] degrees as people say oh I don't think
[1:03:48] Christianity is the only way it is
[1:03:50] there's only one door there was only one
[1:03:53] door - they are is that right and Jesus
[1:03:57] said amen even to the Pharisees of his
[1:03:59] day he said except you believe that I am
[1:04:02] he you should likewise die in your sins
[1:04:06] the problem is is finding real
[1:04:09] Christians because everybody that say
[1:04:12] they are Christians are not reflecting
[1:04:14] Christianity chief this Bible is soul is
[1:04:22] full from Genesis to Revelation fusion
[1:04:26] or when we get in the book of Revelation
[1:04:28] hello you are in the book of Revelation
[1:04:31] you're right at the place - we're up in
[1:04:33] the burn happen but it will it's going
[1:04:39] to happen people you know they look at
[1:04:41] that that volcano over there in Hawaii
[1:04:45] and nobody I'm telling you something
[1:04:47] getting ready to happen that's all I can
[1:04:49] take and I don't know maybe God blocked
[1:04:51] me from going up there's my watch
[1:04:53] interstate
[1:04:54] I don't know for a reason but I'm gonna
[1:04:56] tell you something something feeling
[1:04:57] ready to happen now think about this for
[1:05:01] years we've seen underground creatures
[1:05:03] running swimming not running with Swift
[1:05:06] away from danger right and then when
[1:05:09] they catch them some of them are boiled
[1:05:11] already cooked as if they've ran through
[1:05:14] a fire under water hundreds of birds
[1:05:17] falling thousands of fish dying all
[1:05:20] kinds of stuff happening now and people
[1:05:22] don't even think one thing about it and
[1:05:23] the Bible speaks of all of that and what
[1:05:28] is it the earth is groaning there's
[1:05:31] getting ready to come a birth right see
[1:05:34] because you got to understand everything
[1:05:35] is about birthing right now you said
[1:05:39] what do you mean this world would go
[1:05:41] through he's going through a
[1:05:41] justification it went through his water
[1:05:43] baptism amen by the way of Noah it went
[1:05:47] through the blood which was st. vacation
[1:05:49] when Jesus Christ died and his blood
[1:05:51] fell on the earth is sanctified it you
[1:05:55] see what I'm trying to say men don't go
[1:05:57] to hell because of their evil doings men
[1:06:01] go to hell because they refuse to accept
[1:06:03] Jesus Christ as they Savior you were
[1:06:06] born a sinner hallelujah
[1:06:09] you can't crucify the pea because he's
[1:06:11] appearing he was Vaughn appearing and in
[1:06:16] order to change the pin you got to
[1:06:17] change his nature that's what the Holy
[1:06:20] Ghost in the Holy Ghost is God coming in
[1:06:22] you giving you a change of nature is
[1:06:31] this okay I I got I'm alone when the
[1:06:34] preacher so I'm trying to hurry right we
[1:06:36] got guests and I want them to come back
[1:06:40] you know you look at people don't judge
[1:06:42] me we look at people and we must
[1:06:44] understand that God is God and when you
[1:06:47] know you called by God it doesn't matter
[1:06:49] what people think right so you look at
[1:06:52] these things and you say all brother
[1:06:53] Brooks you know what is wrong with these
[1:06:55] people
[1:06:56] people think they got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:57] when they don't have it and all how can
[1:07:02] you know the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[1:07:04] Ghost know his word the Holy Ghost says
[1:07:07] Amen you know what Amen it means so be
[1:07:10] it let God's will be done
[1:07:13] right
[1:07:18] you love the Lord we look at this thing
[1:07:22] and we we say Oh what is your purpose
[1:07:26] your purpose can be one that stands with
[1:07:28] God or one that stands against God you
[1:07:32] got Christ and you got Antichrist those
[1:07:35] are only two Spears in the world one
[1:07:38] that's stand with Christ and the other
[1:07:39] one that stands against it
[1:07:41] right the one who says oh this Bible
[1:07:45] don't mean that oh you don't have to do
[1:07:47] this because that don't mean that if I
[1:07:51] say go up close that door right and I
[1:07:54] never change it I say go close the door
[1:07:55] now if you repeat - when I say go close
[1:07:58] the door but you didn't do what I said
[1:08:00] dude
[1:08:01] you got to move and go close the door
[1:08:03] right but it's still gonna be the same
[1:08:07] the instructions have never changed
[1:08:10] that's how it is with God the
[1:08:13] instructions never changes and no matter
[1:08:17] how much you repeat what he says like I
[1:08:19] was telling somebody the other day don't
[1:08:21] you know you as a Christian you can
[1:08:23] become a false witness hello you said
[1:08:27] well how is that brother Brooks remember
[1:08:28] before Jesus had false accusers and they
[1:08:32] said he said that he would destroy this
[1:08:36] temple in three days and raise it up in
[1:08:39] three days that's what they said
[1:08:41] that was his false accusers did Jesus
[1:08:43] say that yes he said it he said see this
[1:08:47] temple in three days I can I can I can
[1:08:50] destroy it and raise it up but he wasn't
[1:08:51] talking about that temple he was talking
[1:08:54] about this temple hallelujah and listen
[1:08:58] they said you know what they killed
[1:09:00] Jesus they killed Jesus cuz he let them
[1:09:02] kill him he said I laid down my life who
[1:09:06] did he lay it down for you and me we
[1:09:10] were sinners like the first Adam got us
[1:09:13] in trouble the second Adam had to get us
[1:09:15] out and that was Jesus Christ himself
[1:09:18] hallelujah one world religion is of the
[1:09:23] devil
[1:09:28] the Bible is all in the only things
[1:09:30] right I know people say whether Quran is
[1:09:34] a crown name right this is right the
[1:09:39] Bible says heaven and earth to be clear
[1:09:40] of his glory right you know you got to
[1:09:44] understand people I was telling somebody
[1:09:46] the other day I think I was here I said
[1:09:50] you know when you feed the baby I love
[1:09:52] feeding babies you got that little spoon
[1:09:55] little cute little thing and you got
[1:09:56] that little food on that mouth and it

[1:10:00] and the baby always spit more than half
[1:10:03] of the food back out all right you're
[1:10:06] trying to put it in their mouth I love
[1:10:08] it cuz you pushing it in you got to get
[1:10:10] a little faster than he is and then
[1:10:12] finally you get them all all that food
[1:10:14] in and your wife is mountain you feel
[1:10:15] like you've accomplished something at
[1:10:17] least they got a good spoonful I had
[1:10:20] enough of them so I know what I'm
[1:10:21] talking about
[1:10:22] don't you know that's how God does try
[1:10:27] to feed a baby a snake you're killing
[1:10:30] hmm people don't understand when my day
[1:10:35] you know they got these food processors
[1:10:37] and everything else you know in my day

[1:14:22] times I wanted to wake up and I couldn't
[1:14:24] wake up hallelujah and when you see a
[1:14:29] man who's been delivered from strokes

[1:15:36] leave such a righteous and holy life I
[1:15:38] thought my girl was doing it but she
[1:15:40] didn't she didn't have to do it she's
[1:15:42] like this if you an alcoholic you know
[1:15:43] what God does when he heals you and
[1:15:45] delivers you he takes the taste out of
[1:15:47] it
[1:15:47] he literally take your desire away from

[1:16:10] to be fulfilled you will not leave out
[1:16:14] of here without fulfilling God's purpose
[1:16:19] can I explain this to you
[1:16:22] Isaiah says a virgin shall conceive
[1:16:27] everybody thought he was crazy you know
[1:16:29] they did this prophet is crazy and
[1:16:33] that's what God would do he'll cause a
[1:16:35] Christian to look crazy in the eyes of
[1:16:37] men while you do what you do you got an
[1:16:44] old friend of mine she says you just
[1:16:47] feel in bondage you don't do nothing I
[1:16:53] said I'm not in bondage I'm free I don't
[1:16:58] do things because I don't want to do
[1:17:00] things there ain't nobody here have I
[1:17:03] ever tried to make y'all do anything do
[1:17:06] I have a law rule over you absolutely
[1:17:09] not the rule over you is the Holy Spirit
[1:17:12] and you know people think well you you
[1:17:15] ain't bondage you can't do this and you
[1:17:16] can't do that let me say it like this
[1:17:18] now when I was a pig I love slop I
[1:17:23] couldn't help it I just love slop when I
[1:17:26] had a pig nature right but when God
[1:17:29] changed that pig nature to a dub nature
[1:17:31] I had I did not want anything to do with
[1:17:34] slop is that right
[1:17:38] even when I'm going down down 80 and I
[1:17:40] smell those pigs it makes me sick but
[1:17:44] there is a time I just love the smell of
[1:17:47] peace y'all understand me what I'm
[1:17:52] saying is it's the nature change that
[1:17:54] God brings in you you do not do it but
[1:17:58] if you allow God you said O Lord I
[1:18:00] really want to change I really want you
[1:18:02] into my heart I really want to see what
[1:18:04] I see in this I could tell you things
[1:18:08] I've seen God create things and I know
[1:18:11] I'm not the only one
[1:18:14] hallelujah I've had God tell me listen

[1:18:35] God for $50,000 one time he gave it to
[1:18:38] me and I didn't steal it you understand
[1:18:45] me now I'm trying to tell you when you
[1:18:47] can have a relationship with God so well
[1:18:49] it meant he'd be just like your mom and
[1:18:51] your daddy like I tell you here he's
[1:18:54] your Lord and he'll Savior but how many
[1:18:57] of you know him as a friend

[1:25:00] well the rap chain in the Bible that
[1:25:03] were they in about well if you don't see
[1:25:05] it it's called translation it's in the
[1:25:09] Bible
[1:25:09] what we'll see that's how crazy it was
[1:25:12] in those day here it was in a scientific
[1:25:15] age this man Noah building a boat on the
[1:25:17] rock only on the mountain Santa's gonna
[1:25:20] reign and he was a spectacle Christians
[1:25:24] become spectacles why because we believe
[1:25:27] this we went we don't take the modern
[1:25:31] virgin why because the Bible said if you
[1:25:34] add and take away from right and that
[1:25:38] new eat that new revised versions got
[1:25:41] eat got whole scripture how out of it
[1:25:44] God don't do that it is the working of
[1:25:47] the devil your soul order me let me tell
[1:25:49] you something if this King James birth
[1:25:51] version brought back the pronto revival
[1:25:54] with King James and Luther and wish me
[1:25:57] and all of the pillar all those people
[1:25:59] the same King James Version don't you
[1:26:02] know a recipe it really remains the same
[1:26:04] produces the same out works it's when we
[1:26:09] change the recipe am I making sense
[1:26:13] I a thirst for solo I thirst for people
[1:26:18] i hunger anything because I know the way
[1:26:20] I used to be and the way I am now I know
[1:26:25] my purpose I had the devil come to me
[1:26:33] straight offer me money and fame I told
[1:26:39] him no even in the Christian Church he
[1:26:42] come to me I can give you this did I
[1:26:45] says no and one thing I said to him I
[1:26:48] said if I can keep my standard if I can
[1:26:52] keep this then I'll do what you want but
[1:26:56] you see he know I can't keep this and do
[1:26:59] what he want me to do
[1:27:00] oooh and you should hold Brotherhood say
[1:27:03] you sick maybe I am but I'll tell you
[1:27:06] one thing there's a purpose for every
[1:27:07] one of us
[1:27:08] you're coming here you're being here
[1:27:10] we're glad you here but my point is this
[1:27:13] you see what as long as I stand up like
[1:27:17] I said the other night I'm trying to
[1:27:18] close folks as long as I stand up you
[1:27:21] know I don't get wrinkles but once I sit
[1:27:24] down I can get wrinkles and the longer
[1:27:27] you sit down you're strong with the
[1:27:30] wrinkles become right and God says my
[1:27:34] bride will be but without spot wrinkle
[1:27:36] or blemish right you cannot sit down on
[1:27:40] God in this day and expect to see a
[1:27:42] rapture in closing everybody to think
[1:27:48] all Christians going in the rapture and
[1:27:50] they're not the Bible says fire were
[1:27:52] wise and fire was foolish
[1:27:54] there are foolish four versions they are
[1:27:57] virgins because and they called virgins
[1:27:58] because they are Christians they will
[1:28:01] have to go through the Great Tribulation
[1:28:02] because they didn't get not get enough
[1:28:05] oil in their lamp and all mean that all
[1:28:07] means not only just power but it means
[1:28:09] virtue after your virtue knowledge
[1:28:11] temperance patience all of these things
[1:28:13] must go up they then become a stat a
[1:28:15] perfect statue of Christ before this
[1:28:18] world in before this nation is the storm
[1:28:21] whew knighted States it's not in the
[1:28:25] Bible yes they are
[1:28:26] revelations 13 that's where she is
[1:28:29] the little lamb came up like that became
[1:28:32] a dragon and all of us know that we're
[1:28:34] talking like dragon we're ruling
[1:28:36] everybody now we used to be a Christian
[1:28:38] nation we're no longer a Christian
[1:28:40] nation we're all in this book every one
[1:28:46] of our lives are in that book you are
[1:28:50] either a vessel of Honor or vessel of
[1:28:52] dishonor but I'll say this by God's
[1:28:56] grace God always give the man a chance
[1:29:00] there not be one person lost or inhale
[1:29:03] that can say God you didn't tell me a
[1:29:06] God you didn't warn me he warns and
[1:29:09] tells everybody and you know
[1:29:15] so everything is in our hands I know
[1:29:19] it's just I tried to put a lot of little
[1:29:21] thoughts in your mind in this message I
[1:29:23] can't hit everything but I tried to show
[1:29:26] you by God's grace that you are here for
[1:29:28] a purpose
[1:29:29] this book is the answer I'm telling you
[1:29:32] everything that you need to know about
[1:29:35] yourself and everybody else is in the
[1:29:37] air why some Christians act the way they
[1:29:41] do isn't here why Christians some are
[1:29:45] real Christians and some are not it's in
[1:29:47] here mm-hmm
[1:29:49] right you know oh if you got a bad
[1:29:53] preacher he's in here if he got a good
[1:29:57] one he's in here and that's why people
[1:30:02] get thrown off with Christianity say
[1:30:04] well if that's death that's being a
[1:30:06] Christian that that's the way Christians
[1:30:07] I I don't want to be that but I didn't a
[1:30:09] real Christian that's not a real
[1:30:11] Christian can y'all can anybody tell how
[1:30:15] many of y'all know the difference
[1:30:16] between a lamb and a goat
[1:30:20] they don't both got look look like they
[1:30:23] got wool or something going on right but
[1:30:25] there's a major difference between goat
[1:30:27] and a lamb that's the difference between
[1:30:30] Christians some are goats in summer
[1:30:32] lambs is that bad to say but it's true
[1:30:37] what does brother Brooks here for what
[1:30:40] am I here for why do I preach about the
[1:30:41] Holy Ghost why do I preach about being a
[1:30:43] born again why do I try to tell
[1:30:45] everybody sell your soul out to Jesus
[1:30:47] Christ that sounds bad right but my
[1:30:51] point is if you don't sell it out to
[1:30:53] Jesus you can only sell it out to
[1:30:54] something why because we have been
[1:30:56] created to worship if you don't worship
[1:31:00] God you're gonna worship devil if you
[1:31:02] don't want you to devil you're gonna
[1:31:03] worship yourself or if you don't worship
[1:31:06] something yourself you're gonna worship
[1:31:07] your boyfriend or your girlfriend you
[1:31:09] gonna worship something because you
[1:31:11] can't help it
[1:31:12] you've been designed that way and so I
[1:31:17] look at everybody and I say to you today
[1:31:20] this world is falling apart find your
[1:31:23] purpose find out what God wants you to
[1:31:26] do I can't tell
[1:31:28] but God can tell you but he can't use
[1:31:31] you until you reach surrender your life
[1:31:33] to Him we go everywhere I've been into
[1:31:38] every church there is I was raised a
[1:31:40] Baptist from Baptist I went to the
[1:31:42] Catholic from the Catholic I went to the
[1:31:44] Methodist from the method as I went to
[1:31:45] the Pentecostal and I'm like Lord where
[1:31:49] are you and cos it I'm in my word that's
[1:31:54] where I'm at I found God in his word my
[1:31:58] wife will tell you I saw I've seen
[1:32:02] things that anyway
[1:32:05] I'm almost afraid to say because
[1:32:07] sometimes people think I'm out of my
[1:32:08] mind or trying to boast I'm not trying
[1:32:10] to boast if I'm boasting it's boasting
[1:32:12] on the Lord Jesus how can you make men
[1:32:15] know he's real in a world of unbelief
[1:32:20] that's tan
[1:32:42] when we see the coming of the Lord how
[1:32:46] many I really believe that our nation is
[1:32:48] gonna continue to stand the way of
[1:32:50] standing not according to this 5:11
[1:32:57] we've been saved for a long time God has
[1:33:00] kept this nation in spite of her turning
[1:33:03] her back on him this nation has turned
[1:33:05] their back on God and you know we see
[1:33:11] how God has been rejected out of out of
[1:33:15] schools out of the political realm out
[1:33:18] of families I mean you go to you go and
[1:33:21] you can say to people you know God is so
[1:33:23] good to me and they won't have a problem
[1:33:25] with that but when you say oh the Lord
[1:33:27] Jesus it's been good to me they have
[1:33:31] problem with that I've seen Christians
[1:33:34] you know who talked they've talking to
[1:33:35] me and then then all of a sudden
[1:33:37] somebody come near and and all of a
[1:33:38] sudden II get quiet
[1:33:40] what is that that's shame why are you
[1:33:43] shaking what made you turn your volume
[1:33:45] down you don't want nobody to know
[1:33:46] you're Christian and you're talking
[1:33:48] about Jesus you don't turn your volume
[1:33:50] down of anything you turn it up right
[1:33:55] you know we've got a lot to learn and I
[1:33:58] say these things I talk kind of like as
[1:34:00] a family tonight because I really want
[1:34:03] you all to see by God's grace there is a
[1:34:06] purpose it's in this book
[1:34:10] did Jesus find his purpose where did he
[1:34:12] find it the Bible said in the scripture
[1:34:15] he found himself in the scripture and
[1:34:18] that's exactly what you're gonna find
[1:34:20] yourself in order for you to know who
[1:34:23] you are and what you come to do now you
[1:34:26] might just be a janitor but be a
[1:34:28] Christian janitor right you might be and
[1:34:32] don't keep a beard Christian doorkeeper
[1:34:33] whatever but the purpose in here if you
[1:34:36] just been designed or God has placed in
[1:34:38] your mind I tell you the truth you know
[1:34:41] being a preacher's hard being a pastor
[1:34:44] is harder right we raised eight children
[1:34:49] and then you got a church who's who
[1:34:53] you're trying to get them to see this
[1:34:56] not an organization this is not a
[1:35:00] denomination we are now called the body
[1:35:03] of Christ and every one of us has a
[1:35:08] function thank you for the amen brother
[1:35:14] you know it's just it's just a reality
[1:35:17] that you and I must know that you did
[1:35:20] not come here to occupy a seat
[1:35:24] you didn't come here amen to stare in my
[1:35:27] face

[1:35:32] come in this place to represent Christ

[1:35:40] world everywhere know that he's real to
