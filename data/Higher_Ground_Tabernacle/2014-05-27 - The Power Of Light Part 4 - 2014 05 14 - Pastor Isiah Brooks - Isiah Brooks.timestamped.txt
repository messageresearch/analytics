[0:00] all surely God is good to us and we're
[0:02] not going to prolong the time we're just
[0:04] going to get right into the word of
[0:08] God we're living in a wonderful
[0:11] time amen Satan is on the Rampage but
[0:14] that nothing he's doing what he has been
[0:17] ordained to do and so I I just want to
[0:21] say by the grace of God Amen that uh you
[0:25] know my back is a little bit stiff so
[0:26] don't think I'm sad because of that uh
[0:29] we've done a lot of running and riding
[0:31] and all of that kind of stuff and then I
[0:33] it started acting up a little bit but
[0:35] it's okay you know um I got a new one
[0:38] you know I mean I got a new one this is
[0:40] not the final this is not the end result
[0:43] of brother Brooks amen so it's all right
[0:47] you know it's it's better than uh you
[0:49] know uh anything else so I I appreciate
[0:52] it God in other words I mean it could be
[0:54] followers God is so good to
[0:58] us and as they say this will
[1:02] pass it's been here
[1:05] before let us turn to Isaiah 60
[1:14] please it was wonderful seeing my uh new
[1:17] grandbaby and and it's amazing how uh
[1:21] little Israel and and Jackson looks
[1:24] looks a lot alike uh but by the grace of
[1:27] God you know it's a it's amazing how God
[1:30] brought him through uh he was born and
[1:34] appeared to be in really good health
[1:35] took him home and that John just kind of
[1:38] overtook him and they had to take take
[1:39] him back uh and uh through prayer of the
[1:43] Saints and of God Amen God brought him
[1:46] home and uh matter of fact they the jnas
[1:50] fell low and we were praying for him to
[1:53] you know I mean just God did some extra
[1:55] work there so he's eating and he's
[1:57] gaining weight and he's looking really
[1:59] good we appreciate the Lord thank you
[2:01] for all your prayers uh put a lot of
[2:04] mile on that vehicle but I told the Lord
[2:07] I said Lord this is all about your
[2:09] service amen it's all about God and he's
[2:11] been faithful Amen in that area Isaiah
[2:16] 60 beginning at uh the verse one and two
[2:18] we'll read one and two arise Shine for
[2:22] the light has come and the glory of the
[2:24] Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The
[2:27] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[2:30] Darkness the people but the Lord shall
[2:33] arise upon thee and His glory shall be
[2:37] seen upon thee Hallelujah glory to God
[2:42] ain't that good amen the Bible said that
[2:45] the Gentiles shall come to that light
[2:46] and the Kings to the brightness of thy
[2:49] Rising amen let's read uh Isaiah 59
[2:53] beginning at the 19th verse so shall
[2:57] they fear the name of the Lord from the
[2:59] West and His glory from the rising of
[3:01] the sun when the enemy shall come in
[3:04] like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[3:07] shall be lift up a
[3:09] standard the spirit of the Lord shall
[3:12] lift up a standard against him and the
[3:15] Redeemer shall come to Zion now I want
[3:19] you to take
[3:20] notice because it says when when the
[3:23] enemy comes in like the flood a the
[3:25] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[3:26] standard against him and the Redeemer
[3:29] shall come to Zion and unto unto them
[3:33] that turn from the transgression in
[3:35] Jacob say the Lord as for me this is my
[3:39] Covenant with them said the Lord my
[3:42] spirit that is upon thee my words which
[3:45] I have put in their mouth shall not
[3:47] depart out of thy mouth nor out of the
[3:51] mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth
[3:54] of thy seed seed sayeth the Lord from
[3:57] henceforth and forever
[4:00] Hallelujah if that's not good I'm locked
[4:03] into that scripture that's the only
[4:05] reason why amen that I can't
[4:08] turn being that I'm a seed of God that's
[4:11] the only reason why I cannot turn
[4:14] because God says so amen hallelujah let
[4:18] us pray Heavenly Father God we thank you
[4:21] for your grace we thank you for your
[4:23] mercy Lord in all that you have done for
[4:25] us Lord you've been better to us than
[4:28] we've been to ourselves we pray father
[4:30] God that you would bless this s service
[4:32] this evening oh God we just want to let
[4:35] the saints of God see where they're
[4:37] standing in such a dark hour Lord we ask
[4:40] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[4:42] pray amen and amen you may be seated I
[4:47] want you to take notice to uh that verse
[4:50] in 19 the 19th verse of this 5th and9th
[4:53] chapter so shall they fear the name of
[4:56] the Lord from the West
[5:00] all right so you got to understand he's
[5:02] not working with the East he's working
[5:04] with the West right and His glory from
[5:07] the rising of the Sun as brother bandam
[5:10] said amen once the gospel came all the
[5:13] way to the West it went back Amen to the
[5:15] east so he's now working with the West
[5:19] because it is a time when the enemy
[5:22] shall come in like a
[5:24] flood see so you've got to recognize
[5:27] that uh America how can I say it it's
[5:30] almost like the the head of the world
[5:33] when it comes to
[5:35] influences uh whether be by Hollywood
[5:38] television whatever Church everybody all
[5:41] over the world want to P pattern
[5:43] themselves like
[5:45] America uh reason why the message have
[5:49] had so many doctrines spread throughout
[5:52] the world is because of the influence of
[5:55] American preachers and they are people
[5:59] people all over the world look at
[6:01] American preachers as if they know what
[6:03] they're talking about because you see
[6:05] they came from the land that God sent
[6:08] the prophet to and understand amen we
[6:11] speak the language of the Prophet so you
[6:14] got to realize amen that these
[6:16] influences Satan knows exactly what he's
[6:18] doing now I have been dealing with amen
[6:21] the power of lighting we preach the same
[6:24] message at brother uh Ray Ericson God
[6:27] had me to minister there on Sunday
[6:29] Sunday morning morning it was uh God did
[6:32] a mighty work but my point is I want to
[6:35] bring out some things because God really
[6:38] uh gave us some more Enlightenment on
[6:41] the word of God turn with me by the
[6:44] grace of God to Genesis and I'm just
[6:45] going to take my time here amen you love
[6:48] the Lord I want you to realize amen that
[6:51] God did not make a
[6:54] mistake Amen in Genesis and nowhere else
[6:57] did he make a mistake but I I I want you
[6:59] to realize amen that God is doing some
[7:03] mighty things and he wants you to
[7:05] recognize your day and his message
[7:10] am a lot of people have been falling
[7:12] away and oh it's not like God said oops
[7:17] I didn't know this was going to happen
[7:19] if you read or listen to the message
[7:21] three kinds of Believers brother bream
[7:24] tells us exactly what was going to
[7:26] happen in our day told us of what spirit
[7:29] that would be that will be working on
[7:31] our Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[7:34] supposedly in Christ he talks about the
[7:37] spirit of Judas Hallelujah come on I'm
[7:40] going to talk about it tonight so you
[7:41] might as well and it's all about
[7:44] you it's all about you I want to show
[7:47] you that in Genesis the first chapter
[7:54] please and God said the third verse let
[7:57] there be light and that's we said when
[8:00] he said let there be light it just
[8:02] didn't stop there the Bible said and
[8:05] there was light see now the focus is on
[8:08] the light not what he spoke but the
[8:11] result of his speaking hello if God said
[8:15] there shall be a bride it will not come
[8:18] back
[8:19] void brother Bon preached that message
[8:22] even on I know a man that could turn on
[8:24] the light he talks about how dark it is
[8:28] and how it's going to be let me tell you
[8:30] like this without the Holy Ghost you
[8:31] will not make
[8:34] it it'll be the grace of God that you
[8:38] fall under the realm of the foolish
[8:40] virgin hello because without the Holy
[8:43] Ghost brother bradam said you either
[8:46] receive the mark of God or the mark of
[8:48] the
[8:50] beast and God saw the light that it was
[8:53] good and God divided the light from the
[8:57] darkness I want you to understand
[8:59] understand this now because God has
[9:02] always
[9:03] divided and you've heard me say this
[9:05] before and I'm going to say it again in
[9:07] the beginning before there was any other
[9:09] thoughts outside of God's thought there
[9:11] was only God's thoughts it was God
[9:14] thoughts that the Angels the sharap and
[9:16] the cherubims and all the creatures of
[9:18] Heaven thought and obeyed am until
[9:22] Lucifer came with his thoughts and when
[9:25] Lucifer came with his thoughts his
[9:27] thoughts were perverted now you though
[9:30] his thoughts were perverted he
[9:32] accomplished it is that right brother
[9:35] bam said in God of this evil age that
[9:37] that Lucifer literally accomplished his
[9:40] purpose in which he purposed and that he
[9:43] would rule A Reign Over the stars of God
[9:46] he said this is his age right here where
[9:50] Lucifer or Satan is God of this evil age
[9:56] we're not talking about the bride age
[9:58] now we're talking about this age that is
[10:01] now in
[10:03] darkness is that all right the Bible
[10:06] says amen that in the in the fourth
[10:09] verse and God saw the light that it was
[10:10] good and he divided the light from the
[10:12] darkness and God called the light day
[10:15] and he called the uh Darkness he called
[10:19] night and the evening and the morning
[10:21] was the first day see God showed amen
[10:25] that listen when he separated the
[10:28] darkness from the night he call it day
[10:31] he call it night and then he throws in
[10:34] why did he separates the the uh uh uh
[10:38] the the light and the Darkness and then
[10:40] he throws in the evening and the morning
[10:42] was the first day I'm going say it again
[10:46] the evening and the morning was the
[10:47] first day after he separated the
[10:50] darkness from the
[10:52] light Hallelujah so you so aware did
[10:55] that place be in the Bible tells us that
[10:58] we are children of of the day and not of
[11:01] the night now we're living in a gross
[11:05] Darkness I read to you that Isaiah said
[11:07] arise and shine for your the light has
[11:10] come upon thee right in other words in
[11:12] this gross Dark Age there's only one
[11:15] light that's really being seen and
[11:17] that's a supernatural light in a
[11:20] supernatural
[11:21] people everything else is dark but I I'm
[11:25] just going to preach it cuz I want you
[11:27] to realize a man
[11:29] that what we're seeing now is that if
[11:32] this age and brother brandom did it we
[11:35] didn't even realize when he took the
[11:37] seventh Church ages that was completely
[11:39] darked out and then he put a sliver of
[11:43] light there he separated the darkness
[11:46] from the light it wasn't him but God
[11:49] inspired him to do
[11:51] it you heard me say it like this when
[11:54] the prophet of God was on the scene
[11:56] there shall be light in the evening time
[11:58] come on there's no such thing in the
[12:01] evening time the sun is going down so
[12:04] the light in which God was talking about
[12:06] was a supernatural light there shall be
[12:09] a supernatural light in the evening time
[12:13] the prophet of God comes along he
[12:14] speaking this message he's showing us
[12:17] about organization he's showing us about
[12:19] denomination he's showing us amen there
[12:21] three kinds of Believers we would have
[12:22] never known that we thought Christians
[12:25] were Christians you either was a
[12:27] Christian or a hypocrite Hallelujah but
[12:30] he said there's three kinds of Believers
[12:32] those who just going to come to church
[12:33] and live ungodly those who pretend Amen
[12:36] to make
[12:37] believer he said that's the worst of
[12:40] them all because the make believer is
[12:42] always trying to find
[12:45] fault now we find out by the grace of
[12:48] God he comes and now he's telling us
[12:52] it's 3 Minutes to Midnight scientists
[12:54] are saying it's 3 Minutes to
[12:57] Midnight now why is he bring to us why
[13:00] because he's trying to tell us that the
[13:02] evening time is
[13:05] gone and God is moving on Hallelujah now
[13:10] he comes along and he preached a message
[13:12] is the rising of the
[13:15] sun right it is a rising of the Sun how
[13:18] can he preach a message haing the rising
[13:22] of the sun he said there's a star out
[13:25] there his ministry is now changing
[13:28] because now is no longer evening it is
[13:31] night time and it's about the breaking
[13:34] of a day woo Hallelujah now he tells us
[13:39] amen by the grace of God is the rising
[13:41] of the sun he tells us amen at this
[13:43] point in time is darkest before Dawn is
[13:47] that all right Watchman you heard me say
[13:50] what is the night if I could scream it
[13:52] out to everybody I would tell you right
[13:55] now whatever you can
[13:58] do get on your knees and say God
[14:01] separate me from all Darkness
[14:05] Hallelujah glory to
[14:08] God why there's coming a Breaking of a
[14:10] day you think it's dark now but I'm
[14:14] going tell you the Bible said that when
[14:16] he then when God created the sun he
[14:20] created the Sun and that sun began to
[14:23] shine his light why because there was
[14:27] seeds under the mon and the mar there
[14:30] were seeds trapped in the darkness or
[14:34] underneath the darkness that God had to
[14:36] shine light upon the Bible said that
[14:40] this sun dried up the waters woo and you
[14:43] got to recognize that water represents
[14:46] people and what's happening now the
[14:49] people are dried up but the seeds of God
[14:53] are receiving the
[14:54] sunlight it had to be separated the
[14:58] darkness had to be moved away so that
[15:00] the seed could be seen oh come on
[15:03] somebody and that's what we see
[15:05] happening in the message right
[15:08] now people let me tell you something
[15:10] well that brother walked With God all
[15:12] these years that sister walked With God
[15:14] all these years how long was Lucifer in
[15:16] church before he fell
[15:19] away and let me say it like this a tree
[15:22] of the forest don't easily fall until
[15:25] it's been dead a long time
[15:31] hello now I'm going tell you like this
[15:33] you can reason with yourself or let the
[15:36] devil because I'mma tell you what's
[15:37] happening right now and I'm going to
[15:39] have to jump because I feel a spirit let
[15:41] me tell you something it's like God
[15:43] revealed it to me and I believe it was
[15:44] God he said listen the spirit of Piper's
[15:47] wife is still moving amen he said Joseph
[15:52] received his Covenant before he got to
[15:54] Egypt amen hallelujah and Egypt was
[15:57] nothing but a a a denomination or
[15:59] organized
[16:00] Church Hallelujah but he received his
[16:03] Covenant but while he was there PA ofa's
[16:07] wife was there ordained to try Joseph to
[16:12] take away his virtue oh come on somebody
[16:16] and I tell you what if you don't run
[16:18] from these people who saying they
[16:21] denying this message you will be because
[16:24] you don't understand this is a spirit
[16:27] amen but it is the Spirit of delusion it
[16:31] is a spirit of Darkness it is a spirit
[16:34] that has been ordained to identify the
[16:37] false seed yes I don't care how long
[16:39] they've been there who they've been I've
[16:42] had five to six brothers who've been
[16:44] preachers and pastors who now denying
[16:46] this message but let me tell you
[16:48] something it ain't in me to do it I
[16:50] can't come like like like like the
[16:53] darkness can't comprehend light this
[16:56] light can't comprehend that Darkness
[16:59] I don't understand that and the only way
[17:02] that you can do that is that you haven't
[17:04] had a personal experience amen you lack
[17:07] the Holy
[17:08] Ghost how brother bam said he's a spirit
[17:11] of
[17:12] Judas and spirit the spirit of Judas
[17:14] waited there he didn't even leave when
[17:16] the 70
[17:17] left he waited there to find fault in
[17:20] the word come on
[17:21] somebody and that Spirit of Judas is
[17:24] right now how can you say Amen the
[17:27] prophet made mistakes here mist listen
[17:29] without the Holy Ghost you can't
[17:30] understand it
[17:31] anyhow is that all right hello is that
[17:34] the truth the Bible said that that the
[17:36] carnal mind which is the devil's mind
[17:39] look it up brother BR said the carnal
[17:41] mind is the thoughts of
[17:47] Satan turn with me to Second
[17:49] Thessalonians now we've heard the
[17:51] scripture read preached so many times
[17:54] amen but let's go there now you love the
[17:56] Lord listen I don't have it in me I
[17:59] don't even know what they're doing how
[18:01] they can do what they do I mean it's
[18:03] just far this thing from my mind at a
[18:05] time like this when all the prophecies
[18:08] are being fulfilled right in your
[18:11] eyes the World Council of churches what
[18:14] you go was he wrong
[18:16] there was he wrong with with these
[18:19] denominational going back into the
[18:21] no was he wrong there was he wrong with
[18:24] the women wearing fig
[18:26] leaves was he wrong about the cause and
[18:29] all these things I it wasn't him that's
[18:32] why it was the god in
[18:35] him what God is giving to you bride of
[18:39] Jesus Christ is more grace he's giv you
[18:42] rapturing
[18:44] Grace rapturing
[18:46] Grace this thing is making me stronger
[18:49] now than ever before I believe it's more
[18:52] now than I
[18:54] ever I hurt for those who are not
[18:57] ordained for it
[19:00] but Judas couldn't be no more than Judas
[19:03] Esau couldn't be no more than Esau y'all
[19:05] hear what I'm saying and you ought to be
[19:07] thanking God if you got something in
[19:09] your heart that I can never turn you
[19:10] better recognize what that is that is
[19:13] the grace of God I told a brother uh

[20:22] you because the seed this light listen
[20:26] nothing could be made manifest to the
[20:29] light and the Darkness was separated see
[20:32] all up to this point in time it was a
[20:35] mixed multitude and we couldn't tell it
[20:37] but now God is saying let there be light
[20:40] see I didn't know this when God gave me
[20:42] this message I didn't know what other
[20:44] people were preaching but God spoke into
[20:46] my heart let there be light I said okay
[20:49] Lord that's where we'll go and from that
[20:51] point on he showed me the power of light
[20:54] he showed me by the grace of God Amen
[20:57] what this light is all all
[20:59] about you know what I've been singing
[21:02] that song there shall be light in the
[21:03] evening time and never saw the
[21:05] Supernatural part of it until God told
[21:08] me let there be
[21:11] light like evening time is going down
[21:15] but at that time it was going down for
[21:17] the world But Rising for the believer

[22:52] one time but they got caught by fire and
[22:55] the fire destroyed them and he said he

[22:59] said those trees was making some of the
[23:01] most awfulest mournful sound
[23:04] woo he said and then he realized amen he

[24:05] 1962 he said they were predestinated to
[24:08] disbelieve the word you believe that
[24:11] Judah said so men of old Jews excuse me
[24:14] said so men of old for ordained to this
[24:19] condemnation to rise up in the last days
[24:23] to disbelieve God's word can't get it no
[24:26] clearer than that he's not talking about
[24:29] denomination and organization he said to
[24:32] rise up see they were laying dment but
[24:36] they got to rise up to disbelieve God's
[24:40] word hallelujah come on somebody it
[24:44] ain't going to be effective if you
[24:45] you're the janitor you got to be
[24:47] somebody in position
[24:53] amen how many knows that the scripture
[24:57] sure for ordained of God to be
[25:00] unbelievers what a pitiful shape
[25:03] unbelievers can't help it no more than
[25:05] Esau could help being Esau or Pharaoh
[25:09] being Pharaoh what a pitiful condition
[25:12] and if you are a Believer tonight in the
[25:15] word of God how blessed your eyes are to

[25:24] how is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[25:27] Holy Spirit throughout out the world you

[25:30] blessed because that's the love of God
[25:33] in your heart keeping you from
[25:38] disbelieving huh I told somebody the
[25:41] other day I'd rather backslide and
[25:43] believe still than to deny it that's
[25:47] Hebrews 6 you are totally
[25:50] lost totally there is no repentance
[25:52] there is no sacrifice so you better know
[25:55] what you're
[25:57] doing I didn't say that the Bible said
[25:59] it the brother said that when he put
[26:01] that on the internet people got mad at
[26:03] him I said mad at him for what he didn't
[26:07] do it he didn't say it God said it and
[26:10] this is the only age you can truly
[26:12] blaspheme the Holy
[26:19] Ghost oh help us Lord listen let me let
[26:23] me let me find this one quote I want to
[26:24] bring to you by the grace of God H he
[26:27] can't take the word cannot be taken out
[26:29] of our mouths he put it there it's in
[26:33] the
[26:35] sea glory to God is in the sea what I
[26:40] said to somebody I said watch this thing
[26:43] you don't give up something for nothing
[26:46] Judas traded 30 pieces of gold these men
[26:50] are not giving up something for nothing
[26:53] watch the outcome of what they receive
[26:58] some church some something they giving
[27:00] up to get it ain't just for nothing
[27:03] people watch it you watch that
[27:06] thing that Judah Spirit thought he was
[27:10] gaining when he was losing but I'm going
[27:13] to tell you something one of the worst
[27:14] things that's going to happen to them
[27:16] their eyes will be open just like Judah
[27:19] saw what he had done at the last moment
[27:22] can you imagine the torment that they're
[27:25] going to receive when they realize they
[27:27] betrayed the Lord Jesus H Oh Glory to
[27:30] God remember brother Brandon preached a
[27:32] message he preached it and he said the
[27:34] second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
[27:36] Christ is that right if there's a second
[27:39] crucifixion of the Lord there's got to
[27:41] be a second
[27:44] Judas like I told the church I said
[27:46] there's got to be those even Among Us
[27:48] amen who's going to betray us and say
[27:50] well I know you you among that group
[27:54] amen
[27:58] listen what brother Bram says listen it
[28:01] and I know brother brandham is not God
[28:03] but I almost make me want to go in some
[28:04] of these folks face and say
[28:11] brother let them know I'm not ashamed of
[28:13] the go of God's Prophet hallelujah amen
[28:17] I I I don't say his name amen not
[28:19] because I'm ashamed of it I just want to
[28:21] put the Evas on the name of the Lord
[28:23] Jesus but I'm not ashamed of it I'm not
[28:25] ashamed to be identified with this
[28:27] message
[28:32] like I tell people if you're going to
[28:33] take it away from me give me something
[28:35] better show me anything out there better
[28:38] all you see is PE preachers who have
[28:40] become P
[28:42] pimps right you got to know that the
[28:45] Bible said according to Proverbs they
[28:46] the adulterous women sitting on every
[28:48] corner and if they're on the corner they
[28:50] got to have a pimp behind
[28:56] them you look at this thing and you this
[28:59] thing is a glorious age they they're
[29:01] dividing this thing now now maybe we
[29:03] could have a real Holy Ghost Revival cuz
[29:05] all they doing is they taking away all
[29:08] those people who denied the Holy Ghost
[29:11] well you grow into yeah you got to be
[29:13] born into it you might grow after you
[29:16] born but you got to be born
[29:19] first acts 238 babies is that what
[29:21] brother said those crying acts 238
[29:25] screaming children he said the word
[29:27] don't know how to bring for no other
[29:29] kind thank God for a
[29:33] prop is the rising of the sun now I want
[29:36] you to see this he says now the Sun at
[29:39] the rising of the sun well there was a
[29:41] time when the world was laying in utter
[29:43] darkness and you got to hear his way of
[29:45] sining it was without form and was void
[29:49] and it was all covered with water and
[29:52] was laying there in the darkness dismal
[29:54] gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God
[29:57] moved upon on the water and said let
[30:00] there be light God had a re
[30:04] Hallelujah had a reason to do that God
[30:08] had a reason he's throwing something out
[30:09] to the bride God had a reason to in
[30:12] other words there's a spiritual
[30:13] application behind this God had a reason
[30:16] to do that for down beneath the waters
[30:19] there were seeds that he had planted and
[30:23] it had to have the sunlight to make it
[30:27] live
[30:28] now what are you saying I'm saying like
[30:31] this
[30:33] creepers there's a lot of wounded people
[30:36] now in these churches because of these
[30:38] creepers that have wrapped their Vines
[30:41] around them it hasn't changed that
[30:44] they're true corn or true wheat but you
[30:46] know how a creeper does when you take
[30:48] away that that uh that vine or whatever
[30:51] it leaves his imprint in that in that in
[30:53] that particular uh uh corn or wheat
[30:56] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[30:58] now you got to realize am man there's a
[31:00] lot of hurting people and just like I
[31:01] told the church up there in bluon I'm
[31:03] not preaching against people you know
[31:07] the people have already marked
[31:08] themselves but my point is Spirits if
[31:12] you don't run from this Piper's wife
[31:17] Spirit it ain't nothing but a Jezebel
[31:18] spirit cuz all of them that's leaving
[31:20] are cutting their hair wearing pants and
[31:22] doing all the things that they've been
[31:24] wanting to do for years
[31:28] now how know God how how on Earth can a
[31:32] person you see what it was there was
[31:34] never a
[31:40] change come on I I wish I could tell I
[31:43] can tell y'all some personal thing but
[31:44] I'm not I I just want you because I it
[31:46] ain't the individual I'm working with
[31:48] I'm working with right now just like I
[31:50] told the church in Lima I used to preach
[31:52] this all the time I said when the
[31:53] squeeze come on you going to find out
[31:55] who the true Ministers of God are
[32:01] cuz they're the only ones that going to
[32:02] be able to
[32:04] stand that's true you said well that
[32:07] sounds cold no no no no it ain't no
[32:09] colder than what Jesus said Jesus said
[32:12] amen after the 70 years has left he said
[32:16] yeah he said and one of you are a
[32:19] devil and he knew exactly who he was
[32:21] talking
[32:23] to was he cold when he said that you
[32:26] better recognize amen there's a lot of
[32:28] devils around here anybody who refus to
[32:31] bring the people to Christ or try to get
[32:33] them to Christ they're not preaching the
[32:36] right
[32:37] message I don't care who they are I
[32:39] don't care if they got that doctor's
[32:41] Divinity and that's been the deception
[32:43] of the whole message people because they
[32:46] feel like the more intellect you have
[32:48] and the more proper the way you can say
[32:50] your words amen come on that's just
[32:53] opposite of way God thought God thought
[32:55] it was best to send a seventh grade Ed
[32:57] educ educated man to his bride if he
[32:59] wanted to send a theologians he could
[33:01] have G gotten a few of
[33:05] them and he tells us brother bam tells
[33:08] us it's the teaching that kills the
[33:13] people yet the message people love all
[33:16] of that they want all the Deep
[33:17] Revelations and where has it gotten them
[33:21] now that fussing and fighting just like
[33:23] the people did didn't didn't Jesus said
[33:26] you know why because Inter uals don't
[33:28] know how to take the word of God and
[33:29] bring it in season they just get it and
[33:32] go hello but even a prophet of God who's
[33:35] feel with the Holy Spirit he knew how to
[33:36] bring it in season meat in due season
[33:40] meat out of season will make you sick
[33:42] and that's what happened to this
[33:44] bride people around it at the first
[33:47] light ever listen he said and the first
[33:50] light was ever given in the Earth was
[33:53] God's spoken word the first light that
[33:56] ever struck the Earth was God's spoken
[33:58] word he said let there be light and
[34:00] there was light see that's why people
[34:02] are well how can he say let there be
[34:03] light here and then he said let there be
[34:05] light here because he was talking about
[34:06] two different types of light Hallelujah
[34:09] he's talking about this light he's
[34:10] talking about the light that was so
[34:12] bright they said it was brighter than
[34:14] the Noonday
[34:17] Sun that was Jesus Christ himself he
[34:20] said I am the light of the world Paul
[34:23] saw it he said it was brighter than the
[34:25] Noonday Sun that's the light he talking
[34:28] about the light who created the light is
[34:31] that right amen and let there be light
[34:33] and there was light and uh that turned
[34:36] Darkness into
[34:39] light the light turned Darkness into
[34:41] light that's why the Bible talk about
[34:43] your heart being dark when light strikes
[34:46] your heart that's darken it turns it
[34:49] into light is that right it shows the
[34:51] power of
[34:54] light Darkness and Light can't remain in
[34:57] this in one room at the same time it
[34:59] can't
[35:02] happen not like
[35:04] this if the room is real big maybe down
[35:07] the hallway but not in the power of the
[35:10] light not in the reach of the light
[35:11] wherever the light is it transformed the
[35:14] darkness amen then the spirit of God as
[35:17] it moved and this is what I was trying
[35:19] to tell people I said you know what
[35:21] people think sometime I'm too easy and
[35:23] sometime people don't understand listen
[35:25] what he says he says and the spirit of
[35:28] God as it moved with love and compassion
[35:32] at that great day the first day of the
[35:35] dawn of creation upon the Earth see
[35:38] that's what has happened to the message
[35:40] what they did they put everything under
[35:42] a law and now the law has killed them
[35:45] they couldn't do it you got to do this
[35:47] you got to do this and if you don't do
[35:49] this you're going to hell that is not
[35:51] the way the prophet of God brought
[35:54] it What attracted us to him was his
[35:57] compassion
[35:58] in his love for so oh he did he brought
[36:01] it straight but the spirit that he
[36:03] brought it in was because he
[36:10] cared that's why you can't repeat
[36:13] everything he said people said well what
[36:15] do you mean you can't call nobody Miss
[36:17] dog
[36:19] meat unless your love the love of God is
[36:22] in your heart prompting you to do that
[36:24] you do that God going to judge you if
[36:27] that person is
[36:28] offended y'all hear what I'm saying
[36:31] there was a spirit behind those words
[36:33] they were just not words to condemn the
[36:36] prophet of God knew exactly what to say
[36:38] when to say it to get to the hearts of
[36:41] somebody but the condemn them was to
[36:44] saved them but we I've heard people say
[36:47] that in in condemnation they forgot
[36:49] where they were and the great day the
[36:52] first day of the dawn of creation upon
[36:54] the Earth the Sun Rose and swept across
[36:57] it raised and dried up the waters from
[37:00] the earth and made what an
[37:04] atmosphere and for this first time it
[37:07] was to bring joy and life to the Earth
[37:11] not by seeds by a seed that was a great
[37:16] hour so what he did see what you we must
[37:19] recognize is this a seed though it be in
[37:23] all of us it's still a seed it is only
[37:26] one seed which is God's seed and you
[37:29] have been ordained to bring
[37:32] joy and life to the Earth the whole
[37:36] creation groans for the manifestations
[37:39] of the sons of God this is a great hour
[37:43] amen denominations they do they going to
[37:45] do what they doing but right now we're
[37:47] at the breaking of the day why you say
[37:49] that I said because when the prophet of
[37:51] God said and preach that message it's
[37:52] the rising of the sun he was saying it
[37:55] is not far now God the Rapture is about
[37:58] to take place that that's what he's
[38:00] saying and and people are they don't see
[38:03] it see and and the reason why is because
[38:05] if you're a child of the night you can't
[38:07] see what we're seeing if you're in
[38:10] darkness the world you
[38:13] love if you in light it's Heaven that
[38:16] you
[38:19] love the first time the sun rose of
[38:21] Genesis it was to bring a message that
[38:23] there will be life upon the Earth mortal
[38:25] life is that right he said but this time
[38:28] when the sun rose there was a dual
[38:30] Sunrise another sun rising is not the
[38:33] only Su in Rising it was a s o n had
[38:37] risen to bring eternal life to All God's
[38:42] promised seed by for knowledge he had
[38:47] seen laying upon the Earth you hear what
[38:50] I'm saying so he take Genesis and he
[38:53] takes our time and he puts it in the
[38:56] same position of being Ved with without
[39:00] form without shape but it was the seed
[39:02] that was laying there and he had to say
[39:05] let there be light and that's what he's
[39:07] doing the SE a in denomination they're
[39:10] in the message they're in this field so
[39:13] when the light came and the light is
[39:16] come don't you see what oh I wish you
[39:18] could see what I'm seeing this light
[39:20] amen has struck my soul and is doing a
[39:23] greater move in my life now than it ever
[39:26] had been before
[39:29] What's Happening Now what light I know
[39:31] who I am I know I'm a seed of God
[39:35] because I know I can't do what they
[39:38] doing it ain't in
[39:40] me I'm not looking for ways out I'm so
[39:44] enjoying this I I'm not looking for
[39:47] nowhere I don't know nothing else don't
[39:49] want there nothing else
[39:58] oh he said no more than the boty life uh
[40:01] back there at the beginning without the
[40:03] Su in to bring it to life no B the day
[40:06] when the Son of God is upon the Earth
[40:08] what is this rising in order to rise you
[40:10] got to be down
[40:12] somewhere rise me come on up Hallelujah
[40:16] and right now this move that's I told a
[40:19] brother over there I said don't you know
[40:20] what this thing is doing Satan is he
[40:23] just ain't as smart as he think he is I
[40:25] said but don't you see what this thing
[40:26] is doing I said said it's literally
[40:28] uniting the bride by the
[40:30] word regardless to her Doctrine she's
[40:33] now standing it's
[40:35] right for the first time in history
[40:38] since the prophet of God has gone off
[40:40] the scene there's a people who made
[40:43] different in their doctrines but they're
[40:45] saying I know it's
[40:47] right come on somebody oh this exciting
[40:51] me because the next move is the rein
[40:53] filling of the Holy
[40:55] Ghost gather them Lord God gather them
[40:58] bring them all in the upper room let
[41:00] them get on one Accord Hallelujah and
[41:03] when they get on one Accord the power of
[41:05] God lifts up a standard when the enemy
[41:08] comes in like a flood the spirit of the
[41:11] Lord lifts up a
[41:13] standard I'm telling you now I'm
[41:15] preaching something I ain't even thought
[41:16] about right now I know it's God call it
[41:21] prophecy whatever you want to call
[41:24] it if God is speaking tonight that's
[41:27] what we got to look forward
[41:30] to cuz brother bradam in many places
[41:32] said there come another infilling of the
[41:34] Holy Ghost that are pack us with
[41:35] rapturing faith and take us out of here
[41:38] hallelujah but you see if we must meet
[41:41] the same criteria and that is being on
[41:43] one
[41:46] Accord God is doing it God is doing it
[41:49] God is doing it
[41:52] m
[41:54] Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[41:59] no more as I said
[42:01] amen as you in to bring life no more
[42:03] than today when the Son of God is upon
[42:05] the Earth it takes the s o n light to
[42:07] bring them to eternal life his chosen
[42:10] ones that he knew before the foundation
[42:12] of the world he has chosen them of
[42:14] himself before the foundation chosen
[42:17] can't you see oh Lord if I could like to
[42:19] said my mind he's holding it together
[42:21] right now cuz it just want to go wild

[42:25] you hear it do you hear him calling you
[42:27] chosen that you were chosen in him

[42:32] world I better understand the seals now
[42:35] Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace
[42:41] Hallelujah glory to God it would have it
[42:45] also raised to life listen he said
[42:48] listen in the Easter morning then in the
[42:50] dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that
[42:52] time for we are not the dust of the
[42:55] earth and in heaven there was a book of
[42:58] memory and his attributes was in him
[43:00] knowing that because his son of God
[43:03] raised it would have also raised to life
[43:05] every son that was for ordained to this
[43:07] great time he knew it would be and what
[43:10] a more glorious Sunrise that was then it
[43:13] was at the beginning at that at time

[43:18] got up you got up I don't understand it
[43:21] but he got up I got up he's risen I'm
[43:24] risen Hallelujah that's why you can't
[43:27] deny it you know it already happened you
[43:30] were
[43:36] there oh my God in the message Shalom he
[43:40] says now good morning means peace
[43:43] darkness is gathering what's is
[43:46] gathering for to show the
[43:49] light come on somebody Isaiah 61 says
[43:53] Rise and Shine for the light has come to
[43:55] you that's the reason I can say shalom
[43:58] the light has come to you what light
[44:01] people right now the light has come to
[44:04] you I don't know how to say it oh I just
[44:08] know what my experiences are be what's
[44:10] happening in me right
[44:12] now before now when I've heard this
[44:16] thing over a year or so ago
[44:20] nonsense but I didn't catch it I didn't
[44:24] catch it I didn't see it like I see it
[44:25] now
[44:27] he's saying peace to you peace to me you
[44:31] maybe you can't identify it like that
[44:32] but I'm saying peace to
[44:35] me W to the elect woman to the elected
[44:39] lady those who God before the foundation
[44:41] of the world called out and ordained to
[44:44] that the rest of them will never see
[44:48] it can you see it can you see it he said
[44:51] the rest of them will never see it
[44:53] they'll never know nothing about it the
[44:56] Bible says so and Jesus said no man
[44:59] would come to me except the father draws
[45:01] him first and all the father has given
[45:03] me will
[45:05] come wo glory to God he said then stood
[45:10] Judas light shining up here but back in
[45:14] his heart was dark seed shining they
[45:19] looking at him and it no nobody
[45:20] suspected him but he said on the inside
[45:23] was dark seed and when the show down
[45:25] come to the darkness show
[45:28] when The Showdown came the darkness
[45:31] showed here was a little old woman all
[45:35] black out up here talking about the
[45:37] woman at the well from uh but down here
[45:40] was a predestinated seed and when the
[45:43] light come it scatter the darkness away
[45:46] and showed forth see what I'm saying we
[45:49] know Messiah has come and when he does
[45:52] he will show us these things Jesus said
[45:55] I am he but Judah J doubted
[46:01] it he said Judas doubted it yet supposed
[46:04] to be walking in the light see yet
[46:07] supposed to be walking in the light but
[46:10] he doubted it Hallelujah see the light
[46:13] up here doesn't matter it's the light
[46:16] down here that counts see when it's in
[46:19] your heart you can't give it up
[46:21] Hallelujah in your head if Satan
[46:23] persuaded if you let somebody persuade
[46:26] you into the message you can let
[46:27] somebody persuade you
[46:31] out it's a light down here that counts
[46:34] the light up here will will walk in
[46:36] fellowship and everything else but when
[46:39] the real power of God hallelujah comes
[46:42] in it it can't come back to the Dead Sea
[46:45] it'll reflect off in a denomination but
[46:48] when it's back down here a genuine
[46:51] predestinated seed when that light comes
[46:54] down here shows all the darkness of away
[46:57] from you and put you in fellowship with
[47:01] Christ huh he was the one who gave us he
[47:05] Li uh gave you life before the
[47:07] foundation of the world he keeps going
[47:08] back there otherwise you'll never see it
[47:11] what God Said now to you predestinated
[47:14] seed Shalom amen God peace rest upon you
[47:18] because we've near the end
[47:24] now he's saying we need near the are you
[47:28] catching this thing this thing that's
[47:30] happening in the message is one sure
[47:33] sign we're near the
[47:35] end wo well right down to the end we're
[47:40] going to talk about the group for a
[47:41] while Shalom God's light has come the
[47:44] world light is Vindicated again so that
[47:47] you can see the manifestation of the
[47:50] promise of God for this day search the
[47:53] scriptures for in them you think you
[47:54] have eternal life they testify of the
[47:57] day that we're living in what is this
[48:01] light of the day what did the bible
[48:03] promises for this day see
[48:07] what and see what have it is see what it
[48:11] is amen how it is amen so he says listen
[48:14] you and I must recognize that this thing
[48:16] has come brother he's going off the
[48:18] scene but he says now in the rising of
[48:20] the sun there's got to be a Breaking of
[48:22] the day look what he says now oh oh oh
[48:26] come on somebody I'm enjoying this and I
[48:28] I hope you are he said in the beginning
[48:31] of the the end of the Gentile uh Gentile
[48:33] disiz he said uh look at he says um uh I
[48:37] love I love to get up early don't you
[48:39] like to rise early I remember when when
[48:42] Brethren and I were in the mountain real
[48:44] early in the morning around 4:00 we
[48:47] rised up looked hanging back there and
[48:50] there was a the morning star that's what
[48:52] I'm working with it gets real dark just
[48:54] before the break of day
[48:57] we see the darkness Gathering now what
[49:00] is it it's light pressing against the
[49:03] darkness one has to give
[49:07] away all the creeping things that's been
[49:09] running through the night when that sun
[49:12] comes up they take to shelter and when
[49:14] the light shine night and darkness night
[49:18] and light cannot exist in the same
[49:20] building is either day not dark or is
[49:22] light and light is so much more powerful
[49:25] than Darkness so Christ is so much more
[49:28] powerful than all the evil in the world
[49:32] now remember he says now we're taught by
[49:34] scientists as light began to come into
[49:36] condence and darkness the darkness and
[49:39] the Darkness gather all his hostes
[49:41] together to fight against the light but
[49:43] the light prevails and come on
[49:45] Hallelujah the light prevails what light
[49:48] the light on the inside of you it shall
[49:51] Prevail I Don't Care What doctrine what
[49:54] accusation what they try and listen they
[49:56] will go to the council oners amen Judas

[51:21] done to the Bible it is made it of
[51:24] nonone effect but but there's a bride
[51:27] who may not have ever seen a miracle
[51:29] know that it's true know that it's right
[51:31] and God said I'mma prove it why because
[51:34] right now when the enemy comes in like a
[51:36] flood I lift up a standard is that right
[51:39] oh come on somebody when Satan lift up a
[51:43] came in like a flood on on Moses what
[51:45] did God go God proved to the world who
[51:49] had the true Living God is that right
[51:52] absolutely right now I'm coming to
[51:54] something in just a moment the tells
[51:58] us amen except the Lord build a house
[52:01] the laborers labor in
[52:03] vain this ain't a this ain't a a
[52:05] situation where you can practice living
[52:07] holy you got to have the Holy Ghost and
[52:09] I don't care what nobody say brother
[52:11] said I fear that the people the
[52:12] preachers have not been getting the
[52:14] people of
[52:15] Christ
[52:17] now if y'all recognize I'm going to tell
[52:19] you this like this people of God I can I
[52:21] don't know whether you got it but God
[52:22] knows and you know but don't you let
[52:25] this thing this hour pass you bow with
[52:26] the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost
[52:28] you're dead twice
[52:31] dead hello somebody oh my God don't you
[52:35] understand amen that's why the devil
[52:37] tried to distract us keep us busy keep
[52:39] us tired keep us everything he don't
[52:41] want us to focus on the thing that's
[52:42] going to get us out of here he don't
[52:44] care about you coming to church and
[52:46] being religious and all that he don't
[52:48] care about that he's all just interested
[52:50] in your soul come on somebody and
[52:54] somewhere somehow and somewhere soon
[52:56] somehow you better make sure you got
[53:00] it and how you know you going to get you
[53:02] got it your change your desire for this
[53:06] world has to change must change will
[53:12] change and what happened the Bible is
[53:14] right and you're
[53:19] wrong I was telling you this and I said
[53:21] this before don't you know Jacob had to
[53:23] wrestle with that angel all night listen
[53:26] go to your computer and find out what
[53:27] brother BR talks about all night
[53:30] prayer and rebuking the people because
[53:32] they don't do it no
[53:34] more uh what is it people don't realize
[53:37] a there's power in prayer especially at
[53:40] night because first of all it's going to
[53:43] be difficult to pray at night because
[53:44] that's when all the demons out but
[53:47] understand there's a Breaking of the day
[53:49] Hallelujah and is at that breaking of
[53:52] the day that God rewards you amen is
[53:55] that right the Bible said Jacob was a
[53:57] true seed of God he had the promises of
[53:59] his daddy and everything else but he
[54:01] didn't have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[54:04] and Jacob knew he saw Esau coming he
[54:06] said I can't face Esau by myself
[54:09] Lord and you can't face this world of
[54:11] Council of churches by
[54:13] yourself the Bible said according to
[54:15] Daniel there'll be a time that's never
[54:17] been
[54:18] before you and I can't imagine the hell
[54:20] that's going to be on this Earth forgive
[54:22] me for sin it that way but that's
[54:24] exactly the way it is hallelujah you
[54:26] said I'm having a rough time this is
[54:27] light feather work compared to what
[54:29] these demons got coming our
[54:32] way the way they can torture men right
[54:34] now has never been even heard
[54:37] of Hallelujah did y'all know
[54:41] that these old Devils even know how to
[54:44] put things inside you to make them eat
[54:46] you from inside
[54:49] out people of God we better know what we
[54:52] we we we're working with maybe it ain't
[54:54] an urgency now but it will be and I
[54:56] trust TR by the grace of God because I'm
[54:57] going to tell you something the door of
[54:59] the Gentile is about over that's how
[55:01] close we are to this thing because if
[55:03] God let me put it this way if it's
[55:05] Darkness you know how it is on the world
[55:08] side if it's Darkness on this side it
[55:10] must be light on the other side it can't
[55:13] be light on both sides of the world
[55:15] Hallelujah come on somebody and if it's
[55:18] midnight and getting ready to break day
[55:20] don't you see what I'm saying that's why
[55:22] those Blood Moons had to come those
[55:24] Blood Moons were showing a change in
[55:27] dispensation I don't know whe that's the
[55:29] correct word but a change in time God
[55:32] turning now he's turning and he's
[55:34] literally focusing himself on these
[55:36] seeds because God going to raise up
[55:38] prophets over
[55:45] there help us
[55:48] Lord don't worry
[55:53] shalom shalom peace be to the bride you
[55:56] don't worry amen God going to take care
[55:59] of that but you got to have your mind
[56:01] focused see let me read this and I'm I'm
[56:03] going let you
[56:05] go now Jesus said he came work and you
[56:07] heard me say this the last minute he
[56:08] said he said I must work the work of him
[56:12] that sent me while it is day the night
[56:15] cometh when no man can
[56:17] work is that right now realize brother B
[56:21] told us he said the night is coming it's
[56:23] going to be so bad you we as preachers
[56:25] can't even preach pray for people L
[56:27] we'll be shot killed thrown in
[56:30] prison that's what he's saying do God's
[56:33] Will and work now while it's still time
[56:36] and the law is not against you but when
[56:38] that thing crushed amen you can't do
[56:40] nothing L you be killed orless you
[56:43] become a whatever but he's saying it
[56:45] won't you can't do nothing when it's
[56:48] dark as long as I'm in the world I am
[56:51] the light of the world that's what he
[56:52] says now now I'm going to read something
[56:55] here it called it comes from countdown
[56:57] brother B talks about the horse and
[56:59] buggy the automobile airplane and the
[57:02] astronaut and he goes on he say father
[57:05] he said I pray father that they realize
[57:08] it isn't trying to down uh condemn uh H
[57:12] uh them what they had is only trying to
[57:16] give them what I have is is is trying to
[57:18] give them more uh rapturing Grace for
[57:23] the hour will come when we will have to
[57:27] have rapturing power and not only to
[57:30] heal the body but to change it in
[57:34] a moment in a twinkling of an eye Christ
[57:39] will be so real in their bodies till
[57:43] he'll change it by his great death and
[57:47] what he
[57:50] purchased is he real in your body yet he
[57:53] will be so real
[57:57] it's like having another head you know
[57:59] you got a
[58:00] head you know you got two hands it's
[58:02] real right you can feel it and you can
[58:04] see it you can have no things that's
[58:06] what he's saying Christ will be so real
[58:08] oh is God in Me you he'll be so
[58:12] real into their bodies till he'll change
[58:15] it by his great death and what he
[58:18] purchased may they may they take this uh
[58:23] this today that token I spoke of last
[58:27] night hold it before them and walk into
[58:31] the
[58:31] astronaut granted father where Visions
[58:35] uh Power and the world Beyond known and
[58:39] oh God where all the great mysteries of
[58:42] God is in unfolded in the Seven Seals
[58:47] and made known uh to man he said granted
[58:51] father in the message Jehovah jar he
[58:54] says now it's not some
[58:56] uh man here is the Messiah it's the holy
[59:00] spirit is the Messiah Christ and the
[59:03] Holy Spirit is the same thing so here it
[59:07] is now just working in the flesh getting
[59:11] the body ready for the rapturing grace
[59:14] see the Holy Ghost is the only thing
[59:16] that could be working in you to get you
[59:18] ready for the
[59:19] Rapture and and
[59:22] yet we just say oh
[59:24] well but I tell you one thing
[59:27] folks all I can say is
[59:30] this they're coming a
[59:32] time when we wish we had been more
[59:43] diligent he says listen in and and I'm
[59:45] going close in he the beginning and
[59:46] ending of the Gentiles he said what is
[59:48] it I've walked out and looked at the
[59:51] great morning star as she began to move
[59:53] Yonder what does the morning star say
[59:56] say the Morning Star is only reflecting
[59:58] the screem light of the sun coming is
[1:00:01] that night is that right the Morning
[1:00:04] Star the reason is so bright you know
[1:00:07] why it is the Sun so much closer to it
[1:00:10] it's a pressing on and a moving star
[1:00:13] hailing the coming of the sun all right
[1:00:17] you moving stars it's time to go hailing
[1:00:20] his
[1:00:21] coming shine morning Stars rise early it
[1:00:26] says that the sun will soon be here when
[1:00:29] we look and see the Morning Star just a
[1:00:31] glistening in the sky it means that the
[1:00:34] sun will shine pretty soon and when we
[1:00:37] see the morning stars of God rising and
[1:00:41] I put there myself take your position
[1:00:43] and shine into the glory of the
[1:00:45] resurrection of Jesus Christ shows that
[1:00:48] the Supreme one is pressing on the
[1:00:51] lights are gathering but the morning
[1:00:53] Stars hollering holding on isn't long to
[1:00:57] Daylight hold on is not long to
[1:01:02] Daylight just keep holding
[1:01:09] on as sister Murphy and them used to
[1:01:12] sing just keep holding on daylight soon
[1:01:15] coming hold on today the morning stars
[1:01:18] are shining to the world now lighting up
[1:01:21] the world just before the great darkness
[1:01:24] and the great th thunderboat from Heaven
[1:01:27] the coming of the Lord so he likened the
[1:01:31] coming of the Lord as a great
[1:01:34] thunderboat I'm telling you this is the
[1:01:36] season we're living in you don't have to
[1:01:39] believe me but I'm just telling you
[1:01:41] that's what's happening he's dividing
[1:01:43] the light from the darkness Leo deia
[1:01:46] been in darkness for a long time but you
[1:01:48] see the message had to go through her
[1:01:50] seven Church
[1:01:53] ages and my point is this right now amen
[1:01:56] you got to realize amen you're going to
[1:01:58] either be married to Christ or married
[1:01:59] to the devil there's no in
[1:02:03] between somebody's going to Lord over
[1:02:05] you whether you like it or not and you
[1:02:08] have a choice you know what's in you
[1:02:10] would choose the right thing if it's a
[1:02:12] God if it's God and like I said you know
[1:02:14] with all my heart I know we all come
[1:02:17] short but I'm praying because I you know
[1:02:19] what I'm saying you know I I I I done
[1:02:21] been places many times you know well if
[1:02:23] I fast this many days if I do this if I
[1:02:25] do this you know like I'm trying to uh
[1:02:28] make it happen you know but what you
[1:02:30] know what happens when you the Bible
[1:02:32] teaches us you don't do that you get on
[1:02:35] your knees you talk to the man who can
[1:02:37] make the change if he tells you to fast
[1:02:40] you don't have to worry about it you'll
[1:02:41] never get
[1:02:42] hungry there'll be no temptation till
[1:02:45] God is done with you y'all hear what I'm
[1:02:47] saying but we're living in a time people
[1:02:50] and right now I'm telling you Satan has
[1:02:52] a hole somewhere on a lot of us and you
[1:02:56] got to say God help me delivered me
[1:02:59] because I'm going tell you something
[1:03:00] people of God is nothing you know what
[1:03:03] I'm saying you think about it brother
[1:03:04] bam talk about a foot race in hell he
[1:03:06] talk about the preachers who deceive the
[1:03:08] people and when they he said it'll be a
[1:03:10] foot race in Hell they'll be running him
[1:03:14] trying to catch
[1:03:16] him saying why did you deceive
[1:03:21] me think about God knows I mean I have
[1:03:25] enough trouble here I don't want to be
[1:03:27] get in Hell running from y'all y'all
[1:03:30] understand when no I'm running from
[1:03:31] nobody that's a nightmare in
[1:03:34] itself so my point is this people of God
[1:03:37] I I all I know is the only thing gonna
[1:03:40] get you out of here is the Holy Ghost
[1:03:42] amen it ain't your education it ain't

[1:03:47] being sealed with the Holy Ghost that's
[1:03:49] the only thing that's going to get you
[1:03:51] out of here I don't care let me tell you
[1:03:54] like that's just the bottom line
[1:03:57] and if you got the Holy Ghost you know
[1:03:59] what you're doing you feed it Lord I
[1:04:01] want to I want all these virtues I want
[1:04:04] them all everyone that pet on name I

[1:04:19] discouraged uh as much as possible you
[1:04:22] know these things got to happen and let
[1:04:24] me tell you something the Bible said
[1:04:25] that let they come a great Falling
[1:04:28] Away we thought the blood moons was just
[1:04:30] affecting the Catholic church and the
[1:04:31] denominational church and we didn't see
[1:04:33] it happening here now we
[1:04:36] see now you you you you know our battle
[1:04:39] is with our Brethren now right come on
[1:04:43] Jacob and Esau hallelujah amen you got
[1:04:47] to recognize that majority of those
[1:04:49] people are taking the mark of the beast
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:52] now Methodist churches organizations and
[1:04:55] all already went back to the Catholic
[1:04:56] church and people still remaining
[1:05:01] Methodist lutherans have done the same
[1:05:04] thing now the Pentecostal is doing it
[1:05:08] hello what's going to happen to you if
[1:05:10] you're not in the message what we people
[1:05:12] don't understand a delusion the Bible
[1:05:15] said he chose the delusion to give you
[1:05:18] and the thing is the Bible said he gives
[1:05:20] you a delusion so you can believe a lie
[1:05:23] in other words let me put it this way
[1:05:25] I've heard people talk about our brother
[1:05:27] Jeff he said he really believes that
[1:05:29] he's telling the
[1:05:32] truth he really believes he cannot even
[1:05:35] see folks he can't see he's been
[1:05:38] deceived that's why brother brother B
[1:05:40] said in that message how pitiful how
[1:05:44] pitiful but you got to understand that
[1:05:46] was a choice brother bam said before you
[1:05:50] can uh uh go in error you have to refuse
[1:05:53] truth
[1:05:58] you got to refuse
[1:06:00] it people seeing a man they couldn't see
[1:06:03] God same thing Israel did let's
[1:06:08] stand it ain't the this is folks you
[1:06:11] watch it's going to be a lot more oh
[1:06:13] this one that one that one you'll see
[1:06:16] but don't you let nobody persuade you in
[1:06:18] that nonsense I like I said I'd rather
[1:06:20] be the weakest Saint there is than to
[1:06:22] deny
[1:06:23] it uh-uh uh uhuh I know it's true I
[1:06:27] don't nobody have to persuade me I know
[1:06:29] it's true he revealed that and that's
[1:06:31] got to be a re Revelation in you cuz if

[1:06:35] Mother sister brother your husband wife
[1:06:37] you'll sell them out at the end cuz
