the Lord then it for all the rest of your days you'll be seeking to get to that place amen because there's there's no other place like in the world Amen when you when you first meet Christ that is strong when you first when you first experience the Prince of Peace when you first draw near unto Him and you're not just drawing you're into under conviction under this or that but underneath the actual the full experience of a full salvation where your sins are under the blood where you've been washed by the blood of the Lamb and you get to stand before him in peace I mean you draw near unto Him and you worship Him you adore him your head is strong there's nothing like that in the world okay man you'll be spending the rest of your days making sure there's nothing and it's coming between you and your Savior amen amen let's just stand as we open in our Bibles to the Book of Isaiah chapter 61 amen he's the same yesterday today and forever Saints a man he has not changed one bit amen Isaiah chapter 61 we'll start reading with the first verse familiar scripture Jesus quartered this in the New Testament and it says the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek yes sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn to point unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might all whether they might that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planning of the Lord that he might be glorified amen now scored 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 there's never a time that I read that scripture that I'll enjoy it a man because he did that for you a man second Corinthians chapter 12 read the first half or or read the ninth verse there and says and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me a man lets his power as in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for another church service father another days or where we can experience you being the same father or as you prophesied that 2,000 years ago that you be the same this day here in March Lord Laura so therefore we've come under this roof floor coming to this room all of us gathering together our licks of Fire Lord in one place Lord trustee and you Lord knowing that you are the same father far as you is we open up the word father we've open up the gospel here father we've submit ourselves and you where you said that you would make yourself perfect in our weakness or so our weakness we come to you this morning father expecting Lord the see you Father and your majesty and in your power Lord so we just turned this entire service over into your able hands Lord that you might do whatever you is that you want to do Lord we're at your service father or we just surrender our entire lives into your hands this morning father that you might have all the preeminence and all the glory and all the honor and we just thank you Lord for all things and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen hey it could be seated I just wanted to preach a message this morning called when I needed you the most amen I think all this commitment has experienced times our lives where where you get to a place where you're at your wits in as we say you know you you've done all you can do you don't know what else to do the time when you need Christ the most amen is a time where all of your human efforts have failed all of your you ability and you you try to do this you try to do that you get to a point where everything you've tried just isn't working and all since sometimes as we wait until that time to turn to the Lord you know really in reality we should turn to the Lord and die out to ourselves at first every day but but sometimes you know you get you get to the point where you start relying on your own human ability and your own human strength and when you start relying on your human strength the Lord only let that go on for so long before he'll bring you to a situation in your life to where you can no longer handle it yourself you know you start trusting in your own ways and your own measures and your own ideas for so long God will bring you to a place where your own ways your own measures your own ideas won't work Amen God will bring you to a place where you so need him amen God is just waiting for a real purpose in your life something in your life to bring you to a place to where you're you're just in a place where you finally need Christ a man and the ral of is is you actually needed him all along but what God wants you to come to the point where you realize that you need him amen and and we we all ought to get good at realizing our need for Christ amen not just in the major things but all the little things not just every once in a while but needing him every day of our lives amen because as we read there are as a he city so it says the st. Paul there my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness a man whose weakness was that that was Paul's weakness amen Christ is saying there my grace and my strength is for you my grace is for you my strength is for you amen this is what you need of he says but it cannot be manifested until you begin to manifest your enos amen until your weakness is manifested then my grace cannot be manifested and my strength cannot be manifested Amen who who here would like to see the grace of the Lord at work in your life amen who here would love to see the grace of the Lord at work in your life amen in your situation Amen in in every little problem you're going through right now and the things that are troubling your mind watching the grace of Lord to sin down from God out of heaven and coming down upon your situation awesome the Grace and the mercy Lord comes down in that situation and what the strength of the Lord also comes with remember what happens after the grace Bloor is manifested then comes the strength of the Lord every time whenever God begins to manifest His grace in your life then the strength Lord comes and right behind it to follow up upon his grace amen by one thing it requires as it requires our weakness amen I just wanted to read a quote here of brother branham's from coming from a sermon he preached there perfect strength or perfect strength by perfect weakness I've always loved just the title that one a man he says there in paragraph 56 he says the important thing one of the important things that we must master now remember this especially you young creatures and lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life amen who here would like to fulfill God's desire you know God has a desire for your life amen when Christ died upon the cross he had you in his mind a man it's not just that he had you in his mind B he had you in his mind fulfilling certain attributes of Christ amen and so we all spend our days on this earth fulfilling whatever is at Christ had in his mind when he died on the cross hey man that's why we're here there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us that's right and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we got to make a complete surrender amen a total surrender you know really until we until we make a total surrender God cannot use this why because he will not let his ability be mixed with our ability a meant until we make a total surrender he will because God will not allow his glory to be mixed with someone else's glory I meant it says here his way or it's not his way a meant you know when we when we have say you have a little pet temptation they meant something that you are always stumbling with something always you know whenever the Satan comes and puts the temptation right here you fall and it's like Satan has a little button in your life that whenever Satan pushes that button you stumble you know and and you go on through life you're painting of it you think you made things right and all of a sudden sync comes along pushes the button again and you stumble and fall well not to be that way and really and tell you and tell you you finally get down to your wits in then you say Lord I've had enough you know I'm tired of this thing and I tell you you get so weak God's gonna let that button sit right there you know but God is able to disable that button amen God is able to to demolish that button to remove it out of service take it out of the way why because it's not God's desire to have a button like that in your life amen but but but all of us have the possibility of having such a button installed a meant something where where you you just are always stumbled in this one area and Satan come along push the button you stone and whether that comes from that's coming from something that you have you've allowed to become your pet something that you you're holding on to something that you're you just don't aren't ready to get your wits into about it yet because part of you enjoys I think but you but when you when you finally get down you say Lord it is more important for me to get rid of this and it is for me to live itself amen when it finally gets down to the point where like lord I would rather die than live another day without giving full glory into you or haven't you have the full preeminence in my life amen because Christ deserves to have the entire the full preeminence in our lives a man he deserves to have the highest place Amen when you have one little thing that you cannot surrender to the God then your detracting from God's presence in your life amen when you attract him from God's presence he cannot have the full preeminence and the full use out of your life amen when he puts you on this earth to manifest his greatness to manifest what His grace and his strength in your life amen but when you won't manifest weakness then he cannot manifest strength and grace amen but it requires our weakness it's not and not just any weakness but our perfect weakness well we come before the Lord and say Lord I can't do this anymore Lord I've tried everything I know how to do I've tried I've tried to get rid of this I tried to do this I tried to do that but I'm I'm done Laura I'm at my wit's end I can't go any further Lord I need a total surrender Amen Lord I need this I need you to take this out of my life and I cannot do without you hey Mary it's just like you know you know when when if you remember the story of Gideon you know he was a weak man hey man you know the story how many times has been preached John he was the the weakest man of his family and his family was the weakest of their tribe and their tribe was the weakest tribe in all of Israel and he wasn't a bad and they were constantly having the enemy come and see they harvest their crops and then you come and steal the crops and they were getting weaker and weaker by the day they weren't eaten right they were there their children were eating right they were they were bad shape but when he finally got down to as weak as he could get an angel Lord came by amen and as well as that pattern repeats itself throughout history then whenever somebody got down to such a place remember Sera's Abraham and Sarah when she had the servant you know and and Ishmael was born and when Ishmael was Sarah kicked her sermon out of the house and she went out into the desert with Ishmael and and the baby was starving she couldn't feed it and she probably laid the baby at crying baby under a bush and she said I can't I'll just lay I'm gonna walk off over here on the other side of the hill so I don't have to hear him die she was in a bad position amen she was in a bad position but it was at that time winged the angel the Lord came and talked to her amen and God waits until you get to that place but if you are holding back from getting to that place then God cannot minister to you amen but until you finally get to the place where you can just shut down say Lord that's it I'm ceasing operations here I where we're putting in a stop to everything the Lord I can't go I my whole purpose in life is to serve you and I cannot serve you when I still have this that hasn't been taken care of in my life amen because that's why we came here in the first place was to serve Christ amen if we can't properly serve Christ because of something in our lives and everything should stop everything should halt until we get this thing taken care of Amen that's the whole reason we're here amen as we read there in Isaiah 61 Jesus does Jesus quote from this is a prophecy and Jesus came when he came in his day says this prophecy is being fulfilled right here in your ears and he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me a man you know whenever the Spirit of the Lord God is upon someone it's coming to act it's coming to do it's coming to fulfill something it's coming to a mat that's itself in this in the world so here the spirit of Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me he's annoying me too what to preach the good tidings under the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound amen so in order for this scripture to be fulfilled there had to be some meat people on the earth a man there had to be some folks that were brokenhearted amen how these people get brokenhearted because of things that happened to them a long life's journey amen the to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound you know and we all know that some people are not just bound with real bars but they're bound with situations in the life that they just can't seem to take care of themselves amen but the Holy Spirit is here to proclaim Liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound that bind up those that are brokenhearted why so that their heart can be made whole why so they can live at peace with it so they can draw me nearer closer near to me or look to you Oh Lord amen or because God has a presence for us to draw into a man God has a presence that he wants us to enjoy drinking amen in the presence of Jehovah his healing his peace deliverance fulfill Ness and life amen in the presence of Jehovah all of your all of your deep deep desires can be fulfilled in the presence of Jehovah and if you have something that you that you're longing for in life you just get before his presence he'll take care of it all amen you can either remove the desire or he can fulfill the desire one or the other but no matter why it can be taken care of when you have who created desire in the first place God did Amen why did God create desires to give us motivation amen that's what desires are for to give us to motivate us in one direction now Satan can pervert those desires and motivates in the wrong direction but God is here the Holy Spirit is here to give you deliverance from that captivity amen now if you're a captive to a good desire Amen then there's a motivation there to get you to fulfill that desire but if there's a desire in your life that you have that is a good desire but you cannot seem to fulfill in your own natural ability then your motivation is to the presence of Jehovah amen and when you lay your feet of his presence you say Lord I got this desire in my life and I can't seem to fulfill it but lor it's a good desire it's it's for this four-year Akeem it was for your glory and Lord I have a need Philippi fulfilled in my life I think the president's Lord could come down he can heal he can deliver he can he can write the check no matter what it is you put the check in the bank of heaven and it will clear I'll deposit and the desire be fulfilled in your life a mess like a woman when she has wants to have a child and she finds out there's some medical reason that she cannot have that child then there's a God in heaven that gave the desire there was a God in heaven that can answer the desire amen I mean if a man wants to wants to provide for his family and as a desire to provide for his family or then God has able to answer and fulfill that desire amen if if a man's children need something thank God and a man cannot provide for that neat then God in heaven has ability if that man would just submit himself and become weak before God God can answer the need a member when we get to the point where we need him the most amen remember God didn't choose when God chose Gideon he didn't choose the second weakest mantle and he didn't choose the third weakest man or the fourth weakest man he chose the weakest man land to fulfill his word amen God had something that was needed in his in his in his kingdom their needs in God's kingdom God chose the weakest man I mean the same thing as today God still has needs in his kingdom God still has needs in this church God has needs in your life amen bye until we by God we cannot see the grace of the Lord and the strength of the Lord until first Christ sees our weakness first amen it's not just Christ seeing our weakness but us seeing our weakness and coming to the Lord and submitting to him in prayer a man he said that he would appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give them beauty for Ashes and the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness amen whose mourning in Zion Amen brother bran one-time use in questions answers he was talking about the evidence of the Holy Ghost he says you know the rule there's really only one true evidence of the Holy Ghost and that is when you're fulfilling the word for your hour when you're when you're fulfilling the word for your day I mean whatever the word is for your day when you're following that word you're you you've submitted yourself underneath that word and said yes the name and of the word that's an evidence of the Holy Ghost work in your life but he says but if you really want to nail it down if you if you're just not satisfied with that I can give you another evidence he says that's those that sigh and cry from the for the abominations down the city those that sigh and cry for the lost souls in the city those a sigh and cry for the things those that are out of the way enzyme amen amen he it was a Christ has come with his anointing to point unto them that mourn in Zion a man whose mornings I ought to be us it's the evidence one of the evidences of us the Holy Ghost as we will mourn and cry inside for the abominations that are done in the city amen remember the city was Jerusalem - amen it was God's people amen amen we ought not to be satisfied satisfied to see things in God's church in God's house God has a house everything ought to be in order amen you know I was that there's that phrase oh this is no way to run a railroad you know it's an old phrase an old English phrase one of the things that came from is in order to run a railroad things have to happen on a timely basis Amen if if the steam engine shows up in a town it's on a schedule the tank has to be full of water to refill the steam boiler and then if the takes not full water on the train gets there the things gonna be the things gonna be delayed if the trains running low on wood for the steam engine and it shows up on the port and they need more wood and there's gotta be wood already waiting there otherwise there's going to be a delay on the engine and if and if the tank is out of water if the wood stack is getting low this is no way to run a railroad amen and and and the same thing with God's kingdom the only way to run God's kingdom is with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and the only way to really properly run God's kingdom is with the Holy Ghost and fire in our lives and not just in our lives but on display upon the altar amen as Jesus himself said no man when he lights the candle we'll put it underneath the basket amen every man when he lights a candle he puts it on the high place so that all men can see it and perform work by it amen and so is us so when we were we're seeking the refreshing of the Holy Ghost and our lives I hope we all are hey I trust we all are if we're not then we got problems Amen because this is no way to run God's kingdom amen but we are seeking if we are seeking the revival of the Holy Ghost in our lives if we're seeking the renewal of the Holy Spirit a fresh water from the river every day amen Springs of living water in our lives if we're seeking that renewal then we ought to put that renewal on display in our lives amen otherwise we're guilty of putting our light under a bushel Amen Jesus if he came to this earth and said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the good tidings of the meek he's anointed me to bind up the brokenhearted he's anointed me to proclaim Liberty to the captives he's anointed me to open the prison to them that are bound now the Holy Spirit has come upon us and what does the Holy Spirit gonna do when he comes upon us he's gonna anoint us and once we're in Oien ting what are we gonna do we're gonna go through all God's kingdom we're gonna preach the good tidings under the meek we're gonna bind up the brokenhearted we're gonna proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound amen but when we see those that are bound to refuse to allow the Holy Ghost to miss or through us then we we're not doing we're doing despite to the very anointing that God has given us amen when you see some of those meat and when someone is out of the way and the Holy Spirit is upon you but you will not open your mouth to speak to that person then you're grieving the Holy Spirit we're with you're a baptized amen because God the whole reason that God gives out the Holy Spirit in the first place is for it to be used and you have the preeminence in your life amen but if you shut the Holy Spirit down by not because you got I realize if God ever gives you the Holy Ghost amen is for to fulfill this scripture right here amen that's one of the reasons why God gives us the Holy Ghost is to fulfill this scripture what was it Christ is the same yesterday today and forever have Christ at one time was anointed to bind up to set the the bind up the brokenhearted Christ is always anointed to buy at the brokenhearted and if Christ is in you and he will use you to bind up the brokenhearted amen so if you see the brokenhearted just be in mind that the Holy Ghost in you was sent to that person amen what was it why because Christ is the same if he's the same he's gonna be the same inside of you and when Christ gets down the inside of you he's not going to do some different act if he's not going to sit still and never interact with those that are lost amen as Jesus himself said it's not the it's not those that are healthy than either doctor it's those that are sick they need the doctor and he says and I have come to heal the sick I've come to bind up the brokenhearted and he was anointed to fulfill that amen now we hear who say that we have the Holy Ghost who say that we are full of the Holy Ghost and power of the Almighty God who realized that Christ is in you to fulfill the scripture he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and we got to fulfill that scripture he is the same the only way that we can do it is we've become perfectly weak in our own selves Amen when we become so weak in our own selves we die out to ourselves in the morning say lord I need you to fulfill your scriptures this day in my life otherwise why are we here Amen Jesus Christ said I do nothing but what my father shows me a man when was the last time the father showed you something and how if Jesus Christ came and said I'd do nothing until my father shows me he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's living and moving and having his bean inside of you then there's gotta be some showing going on amen there's gotta be something showing going on why because Christ has to take from the fall he says I'll take from the father and I'll give it to you a man there's got to be a change a change of possession where God where Christ takes things from the father and gives them unto you well you got ya that means he has to reveal something to you I meant when was the last time Christ revealed something to you if Christ has not revealed anything to you recently then there's probably something blocked somewhere you've become blind your latest is having its way with you amen and we're not here to have we're not here to fulfill those scriptures we're here to fulfill the scriptures of the overcomer amen some people will be guilty of fulfilling that they're lukewarm they're powerless they're blind and they don't know where they're where they're going somebody's gonna have to fulfill that Scripture it shouldn't be us it shouldn't be by this claims to have the Holy Ghost to have the baptism saying that they're immersed in the Holy Spirit of the Living God anybody that says that they are immersed immersed in such a spirit should have the evidence of that spirit working in their lives amen otherwise we're blind and we cannot see afar off amen but if Christ is revealing himself to you you have all the channels open and he'll come and he'll reveal himself to you and you can go and he can say oh I want you to turn to the right I want you to turn to the left I want you to say this to so-and-so I will just say that to so-and-so I want you to get down and pray for this person this person is in need right now I need you to pray for him why you know you know it's just like the other day I was going through something and I can't hear and I was preaching and and we afterwards people can't for prayer and as I was praying a thought came across my mind but who's gonna pray for me just because I just going through something you know and as we all do and anything I just kind of I put that I was busy you know I was mystery you know so I took that thought I put off on the side and and I went on praying for the people well I walked out there we were talking and brother rich comes up to me he says I want to talk to you he pulls me into the office he says the Lord told me to pray for you and I'm never gonna forget that the rest of my life that one little thought came across my mind I took it I put another sigh but God was faithful and he had someone who was available that the Holy Spirit could use he says I have an open channel I'm gonna come my brother rich and I have an open channel where I can use my brother rich in that channel that spirit quickened brother Rich's body he walks out of here he opens his mouth and says what God puts in his mouth Amen that's the Holy Spirit is working in the truth amen and that's just a little thing God the Holy Spirit is here to do that every day in every one of our lives amen but we must have the channels open Amen we must have the channels open we must draw me nearer lure closer to thee and then not when then waiting there until we're actually drawn near a mess not just singing the same song every week draw me nearer Laura closer to thee and never actually having a testimony where you can say I sung this on God drawing me near a man there's got to be an answer back if we ever ask God one time to draw us near and we ought to wait until Christ draws us near otherwise we need to just rip that song the other song I never sing it again unless we have an expectation of faith that that song will come to pass in our lives we should never see it but we do sing it and we ought to have an expectation then it can be long Christ it's going to draw us near amen when we need him the most and we need him every single day amen if there ever is a day where you don't realize that you need Christ then that day when when when judgment comes at the end and all of our works are tried that they will burn up in the fire and never be remove no more and we lose out on roared Amen amen because we are here to be used by the holy spirit amen we're here to be available by the Holy Spirit amen we don't want to see our works burned up at the end hey man the only works that we'll see at the end or the works that the Holy Ghost has done through our life amen that shouldn't be a rare occurrence in our lives but through but through prayer and reading their Bible and submitting yourselves under the Holy Ghost Lord there will be things that we do that we'll never even know this side of Western amen the there's been prophesied that when we get to heaven we'll be saying when did we ever do this when did we ever see you or you were hungry when did we see you and you were a need he said Jesus said when you did it under the least of these my children you did it unto me amen and why did they do it unto the least of those because the Holy Spirit without them even knowing it moved upon their lives and they were walking living epistles without even knowing it amen it only comes by a surrendered life a meze I realize not only do we need him the most but he needs us the most and then Christ cannot fulfill his word without us amen and so we got to be in position amen to make sure his word gets fulfilled amen when you allow weaknesses in your life without ever submitting those weaknesses before Christ those weaknesses become excuses and those excuses become reasons why you cannot serve God the way you ought to amen so why we got to take those weaknesses and put them up on the altar instead of allowing those weaknesses that come pet sins in your life amen as Paul said you know not many strong not many noble not me rich not many high in stature were chosen but God has chosen the weak things in this life to confound the things that are mighty I mean he's chosen the weak things amen but until you become weak you cannot become chosen amen amen brother BAM and that's a message perfect strength by perfect weakness see he said you know there was a prayer meeting not too long ago where 150 thousand frostings and Catholics gathered together to pray to have a prayer meeting said 150 thousand gathered together to have a prayer meeting he says and God didn't even notice he says but you take one man one man in weakness before the Lord and he says and watch God move on that man's behalf just think 150,000 people praying and a prophet of our day said it didn't mean one thing to God but you take one man in weakness before God and it means more to him than all the world praying on the other side Amen why because God has chosen the weak things to confound the things that are better wise a man let's let's turn to psalms 107 i kind of a long scripture reading here to read before we close brief psalms 107 here but over in over in Psalms 103 he says that I'm saying quote this here Psalms 103 for he says who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns me with loving-kindness and tender mercies Christ crowns us with loving-kindness and tender mercies I know I we went through this a while back and I was looking these words up and all the root words and trying to get understanding of what the what loving-kindness meant and what tender mercies really work and I was reading about loving-kindness that had really when you really broke it down and it had to do with when a man loves someone so much who is beneath him he takes that man he puts him up and he puts up on the same level with him he picks him up and he loves this man not not as a condescending love but as a man to man I love this person we are on equal footing loving kindness not just continent not just condescending love but loving loving kindness I have picked you up and now I am put you right here by my side I have chosen you I've chosen to pick you up out the ground I have chosen to grab you I've chosen to pull you into myself that's the loving kindness of the Lord not to say he's just willing to condescend to us down there and leave us down there but he picks us up and puts us up flesh of his flesh bone of his bone that's the loving kindness of our God that he is willing to put us as a bride to his side he crowns us with his loving kindness amen and the tender mercies they're had when the root word that had to do with caressing like a man would like when they come down to it he said like a woman like a pregnant woman would would massage her belly when she puts her hand upon her belly because she's she has feelings of love toward her unborn baby amen that same tender mercies the same tender mercies that a woman would have towards her unborn child the same thoughts that a woman had half towards her unborn child as she rubs her belly that's the same thing that Christ has towards you with the tender mercies of Lord hey man the Bible says that he has crowned us with loving-kindness and tender mercies amen let's go to Psalms 107 Psalm 107 has within it has four different stories and the I'm going to read three of them here it's a long read so I'll pray that you have patience with me but it's a long read but the the first the first eight men eight verses of this chapter is a story about the redeemed out of Egypt Amen so let's just read here Psalms 107 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the Lord say so for whom he hath redeemed from and of the enemy he'd get and gather them out of the lands from the east and from the west of the north from the south they wandered in the wilderness in the solitary way they found no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses he led them forth by the right hand that they might go to a city of habitation oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men that verse 8 there is repeated over and over again throughout this chapter well the turn of Israel there they are coming out of Egypt and when they came into the end of the end of the wilderness they were made weak and God delivered them out of the weakness gave them a place to live in and he says oh that men would praise Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful work so the children of men the next eight verses or so has to do with those that are bound by sickness and those that weren't sick those are bound by sickness and can't I get well and those that are in prison amen verse 9 for he satisfies the longing soul and fills the hungry soul with goodness such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in an affliction and iron because they rebelled against the words of God and contemned the counsel of the Most High therefore he brought the he brought down their heart with labor and they fell down and there was none to help then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distress he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and he break their bands in asunder oh that man would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works and the children are meant to the children there today if ever one time God saves you if ever one time God heals you if ever one kind God delivers you from something that you could not deliver yourself out of and you got to praise the Lord God for that every day of your life Amen that constant remembrance before the Lord Lord I remember when I was sick and you healed me I remember when I need deliverance and you saved me IRA when I had this sinn I couldn't get out of my life and you took it away from me I remember when I was sick and you made me well I remember Lord and I'll worship from crazy for that amen oh that main would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men verse 16 amen this here talks about the mercy of God two fools amen for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron and asunder fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul or soul of horath all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he say with them out of their distress he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that man would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works the children of men amen even a fool who was born a fool God since his work heals them delivers them gives them the wisdom they could have never attained to by themselves God did for them what they could not do for themselves they ought to praise God every day of their lives a man I'm going to read this third story was to be the last one that will read but this is talking about mint and marinas and boats boatman when they're out on the seat they're at the mercy of the sea amen and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with her joy see they they go down to the sea and ships and do business in great waters these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raises the stormy wind which lifted up the waves there they mount up to the heaven and they go down to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and art their wit's end then they crying to the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distress he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their iron Haven oh the men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men let them exalt him also in the congregation of people and praise him in the Assembly of the elders let them give the testimony let them tell live to tell about it that God saved me have you ever been on I know I was on a sailboat once on Lake Michigan amen and the waves came up and and we were going down for you know three four seconds at a time and then we were going back up four three four seconds at a time and it was just people were leaning over the side of the boat half the boat was throwing up or the side of the boat and it was just you couldn't even see Lant you couldn't see land anymore and you were going all you could see was the waves around you you were at the mercy of the sea I've never experienced anything like that in my life and it was just amazing to me to realize as men went out there they're at the mercy of the sea but yet they can cry to the Lord he hears out of the heavens and all sudden the sea is calm and it's one thing to read by hear in the song so another thing to see a man upon this earth walk out on the stern of the boat like Jesus and said peace be calm and there's all instantly calm you know you can do that to the storms in your life Amy you know the strong desire in your life something you need something you want and you're the only Lord I need that I want this and you say Lord I need this and God and calm the storm just like that hey man let's just go down to the last two verses here or last three verses of Psalm 107 what's our oath 41 he says yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord understanding Irish message while back understanding the loving kindness of the Lord we are to be in a place in their lives where we have a full understanding of the loving kindness of the Lord that God is willing and able anytime that we are down here and cannot pick ourselves thank God is willing to reach down grab us pick us up send us up and says down and see it easy said they to overcome I they will sit with me in my throne well that's the fulfillment of that verse Amen when he picks us up and makes a full redemption of the things in our lives amen but it will not happen until first we become the weakest man island and realize that we need his strength amen when I needed you the most when I needed Christ the most he was there he came through he delivered me out from my strong he deliver me from my enemies but when I when I couldn't help myself he took care of me a man that's understanding the loving kindness of the Lord Amen let's just let's just an amen how many times is God deliver something I think about the woman that had the issue of blood for 12 years the Bible said that she spent all that she had she sold her things she had she's spitting on doctors and then she is so getting stronger the Bible said she got weaker and weaker and she had one hope left and that was Christ Christ was enough amen amen and and like there was the woman though as they've been bound for but Christ calls are a daughter of Abraham they've been bound for seventeen years and on the Sabbath day Christ set her free on the Sabbath day Christ set her free Christ wants to set you free on the Sabbath day also he wants you because when you enter into his Sabbath you cease from your own works and your chin to his works and the Sabbath is the Holy Ghost when you enter into the Holy Ghost you you can only enter in one way and that's by weakness no longer through your ways but through his ways Amen let's just pray Heavenly Father I pray Lord for myself and all here included Lord that we would come to a full understanding of the loving kindness of you father Lord how you've picked us up out of the deep miry clay or your cess up on a rock Lord to stand by your side father Lord it's it's Lord until we become weak father we cannot see the evidence of you in our lives lord lord I just pray father anybody here be guilty Lord of trying to enter into your presence with some bit of pride somewhere or some some reoccurring sin far like we talked about the button Lord Lord I pray that you are a mercy Lord or that as we submit ourselves to you this day realizing father that all of our trying Lord is vain and Laura's brother Isaiah has that song these things it's not in trying but in trusting Lord we trust and you Father like the marine errs and the boat slower we trust in you or like all the men that have ever sought their deliverance and received it father we receive it only by trusting in you Lord Lord and when we become weak you become strong father so Lord here in our weaknesses Lord we we glory in our infirmities and our weaknesses Lord because we know that your grace is not far behind Lord and your grace will manifest itself in our lives law and then in perfect weakness or you will be perfectly strong so lord I pray fathers we humble ourselves and your sightless Moore and Lord that you Lord would we come upon the scene father now if anybody here be in a situation Lord where they can't seem to get out of it and they've tried everything they know how to try they just can't seem to get deliverance from it Lord that you are the one who came to set the captives free father you said that you were anointed to fulfill that scripture for to set it free those that were bound in prison Lord Lord I pray that they be buddy here underneath the sound of my voice being a situation this morning Lord the You Lord would come down father as they submit themselves to you at their seat or at the altar Lord that you Lord would hear their cry have mercy upon them or that you deliver them that they might see and understand the loving kindness of God or then will enter into the congregation Lord and give the praise and the glory that our God is able he's still alive saying yesterday today forever Lord we just thank you Lord for all things as we turn the the service in your hands father and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you saints remember just as brother Isaac comes only one service no services afternoon I trust you all going the weakness amen amen the only way we'd never truly experience his strength Amen will become weak before him Amen god bless you let's see that little song he's able he is able more than able to accomplish what answered me today more than able handle anything that comes my way oh he is able more than able to do much more than I could ever dream he is a for more than able to make me what he wants me to be Oh
