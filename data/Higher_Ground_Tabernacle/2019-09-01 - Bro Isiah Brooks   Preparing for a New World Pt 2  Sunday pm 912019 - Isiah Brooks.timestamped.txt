[17:40] praise the Lord we're gonna come from
[17:46] Jude right where we left off we'll kind
[17:50] of pick up don't you but we're just
[17:52] going to read the first and second
[17:55] verses of Jude Jude the first chapter
[18:05] [Music]
[18:07] first and second verse
[18:15] I'll wait to everybody find it jus the
[18:21] servants of Jesus Christ and brother of
[18:25] James to them that are sanctified by God
[18:29] the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ
[18:34] and called unlike that preserved in
[18:39] Jesus Christ and called mercy unto you
[18:45] and peace and love be multiplied now you
[18:51] can't get it no good in the net because
[18:56] when you are preserved it means to keep
[18:58] you alive or to keep in existence to
[19:02] make something lasting forever let's put
[19:07] it this way
[19:07] eternally so we thank God for its grace
[19:11] let us pray do you have any father God
[19:14] we come before you we thank you for your
[19:17] amazing grace Lord you have been so good
[19:21] to us we thank you for being good to us
[19:25] we pray father that your perfect will be
[19:28] done forgive us for any sins or
[19:31] shortcomings that we may have done
[19:34] thought may be in our actions cleanse us
[19:38] from all your honor all unrighteousness
[19:40] and God be glory to you in Jesus
[19:43] Christ's name we pray amen
[19:45] you may be seated on this morning I
[19:49] started with the message preparing for a
[19:52] new world and I showed how that it was
[19:56] God amen in His grace and His mercy
[20:00] making this thing happen with us there's
[20:04] nothing that we could have done but is
[20:06] by the grace of God and the more we
[20:10] enter into this message more we enter
[20:13] into God's Word we can see that this
[20:16] preparation is a something that God has
[20:20] prepared he said I go and I prepare
[20:23] place for you the one thing I love about
[20:25] it is because it becomes more clearer to
[20:28] me when
[20:29] I see that I'm a part of God's
[20:31] replenishing there'll be a many people a
[20:36] man that won't be there because they
[20:39] were not in the mind of God before the
[20:42] foundation of the world and they are not
[20:44] in God's replenishing because remember
[20:48] the first Adam as we spoke this morning
[20:51] did not accomplish what God wanted him
[20:53] to accomplish even though the world had
[20:57] been had was replenished or they
[21:00] multiplied and they grew but we found
[21:02] out that those that were drowned amen
[21:07] indoors they were not seeds of God
[21:10] somehow they had been hybrid and it
[21:13] couldn't bring forth the original and so
[21:16] therefore remember now because the Bible
[21:18] said they married giving it married they
[21:20] were being multiplied and everything
[21:22] else so the true seed of God was not
[21:25] there the only thing that was left was
[21:27] amen the seed of Noah the Bible said he
[21:30] was perfect in his generation meaning
[21:32] that he was perfect in his gene he was
[21:35] the only one that had not mixed with the
[21:38] serpent seed now of course we realized
[21:40] that his sons had done so and that's how
[21:44] we understand how the serpent got on the
[21:46] other side of the flood but nevertheless
[21:48] you and I must understand that every
[21:52] kingdom everything must give way
[21:54] remember Amen when Noah preached that it
[21:57] was going to flood God destroyed every
[22:00] kingdom he took down everything in that
[22:04] day and of course we know amen Satan
[22:06] rebuilt his kingdom and he started with
[22:09] Nimrod right after the flood and he
[22:12] started with the resistance on a
[22:15] rebellion amen trying to do outdo God or
[22:18] to prevent God's Word from coming to
[22:21] pass you and I realized there's no way
[22:24] that we can stop the Word of God the
[22:27] Bible said as he has spoken it will come
[22:29] to pass
[22:30] and nothing can stop it is that right
[22:33] and we are now living in the kingdom
[22:35] understand we're living in this hour
[22:37] where everything is ending up where's
[22:41] that right when the seven seals will
[22:43] open and no stunt is uttered Amen there
[22:46] was a voice that came out of heaven that
[22:48] said time shall be no more showing that
[22:53] the ending of everything that had a
[22:56] beginning was at hand and so we see
[23:00] everything the animal kingdom and
[23:02] Kingdom you know you name it it's coming
[23:05] to an end the last one of the last
[23:07] kingdoms that will come to to the end is
[23:10] Satan and his kingdom the Bible said
[23:13] that old devil be thrown in the fire in
[23:15] the fire is that right all of his demons
[23:17] all of his piss apologies will be
[23:20] finally destroyed and then we will be
[23:26] part of the new heaven and the new earth
[23:29] hallelujah the thing that I love about
[23:31] it is that it started with Eve amen and
[23:35] it ends up with the bride she is that
[23:38] final focus is that right amen danger
[23:41] said unto John behold the bride the
[23:45] Lambs wife hallelujah and the Bible says
[23:47] she descended out of Evan come on
[23:50] somebody with the glory of God
[23:53] see she lost the glory of God in the
[23:56] Garden of Eden but in this new Eden in
[23:59] his new world she has gained the glory
[24:02] of God back with her and that's what
[24:06] we're moving into the glory of God is
[24:09] that right
[24:11] see that's why William Branham had to
[24:13] come that seventh angel he did not come
[24:15] to display himself he came to exercise
[24:19] or to manifest the glory of God
[24:23] everything he did was to glorify God and
[24:28] the bride of Jesus Christ is that right
[24:31] she come to glorify God this is why God
[24:35] got rid of or Daqi in in in Esther got
[24:38] rid of a vasty because she wanted to
[24:41] glorify herself instead of the king and
[24:45] when the King called her he wanted to
[24:48] show her beauty so that he could be
[24:52] glorified right not that she would be
[24:56] glorified
[24:59] so we're here by God's grace amen
[25:03] Annoying bait by God's grace that the
[25:05] only way that we can make this journey
[25:08] is that we must be born again and come
[25:13] into that statue of Christ in which God
[25:16] has given to us now we realize that our
[25:20] salvation is common it's simple it's not
[25:23] something complexed is that right let me
[25:28] take you back to Genesis remember the
[25:31] growth of Genesis started by seed that's
[25:34] as complex as it was a seed Dermott
[25:38] izing and coming to its fruition coming
[25:42] to a place of manifestation and it was
[25:45] all in the seed it was God who Dermott
[25:49] eyes the seed the light itself and you
[25:52] and I must understand if the seed is in
[25:55] you it will bring forth Christ it has no
[25:59] other way it can do nothing else but to
[26:02] bring forth Christ this is what I try to
[26:05] tell people I say you can play you can
[26:07] plant seeds you can plant a plum tree
[26:10] from the same different seeds okay same
[26:12] seed same plum red plum red plum red
[26:16] plum but each time that prom tree bring
[26:19] forth each plum tree will bring forth a
[26:22] different amount of fruit is that right
[26:26] one tree might bear it shelter to the to
[26:29] the to the tree is leaning with fruits
[26:31] the other one may just bear through whew
[26:34] amen and you know just able to keep his
[26:37] PO sure but then there there might be
[26:39] one that you know might not be bringing
[26:42] forth much fruit at all so you have to
[26:44] prune it to bring forth some but it's
[26:46] from the same seed understand these
[26:51] trees cannot compare themselves because
[26:54] they have the same blood they have the
[26:56] same origin they are from the same tree
[26:59] you understand me
[27:00] so that's how Christians are we're from
[27:03] the same tree even though some of us
[27:05] bring forth a variation of fruit we
[27:09] still are bringing forth our
[27:11] whatever God has ordained for us to
[27:14] bring forth is what we are bringing
[27:16] forth so I wanted to say because now
[27:19] we're preserved in Jesus so we
[27:23] understand the only way to be preserved
[27:26] is to be in him to be in Christ Christ
[27:30] in us right the hope of glory Christ in
[27:33] you because once you are in Christ he is
[27:36] in you right amen and you see you said
[27:40] what brother what are you trying to say
[27:42] let me let me say like this am i saying
[27:43] this is amazing brother Evan says amen
[27:46] in the message provided place of worship
[27:49] he said it must be God's choosing it
[27:53] can't be ours I thought you chose God no
[27:56] God chose you we have no choice coming
[28:02] he's already chose it somehow help me
[28:09] now hey God chose you he did not make a
[28:13] mistake he chose you you didn't choose
[28:17] him he chose you now what God chooses is
[28:20] right
[28:23] hey somebody what God chooses is right I
[28:27] can choose wrong you can choose Roe but
[28:31] God cannot God choose right after all
[28:35] it's he's the one that's being
[28:38] worshipped and he's got the place where
[28:41] he wants his worshipers to meet there
[28:43] and he must meet him there that's the
[28:46] only place that he stays only place that
[28:49] hear hear you from let us notice here
[28:52] the place I've chosen to worship me in
[28:55] I'll put my name in that place Oh
[28:59] let us research the scriptures for that
[29:02] place that he was has his name in now we
[29:05] have shadows and types all through the
[29:08] Bible we know that of different places
[29:11] where he met is the people but that's
[29:15] not the place that he meets here them
[29:18] today because they were only
[29:20] foreshadowing something coming
[29:23] up to the real place where he is to meet
[29:26] the people the place the church that
[29:29] peace is to meet in and there is a place
[29:33] there is a church that God promised to
[29:36] meet the people in this place and answer
[29:39] their prayer if they would just come to
[29:42] this place and worship Him now think
[29:45] about it he says now we find out that
[29:48] there is many claims that they have the
[29:50] place God's name is in their place he
[29:54] said but you see they put God's name in
[29:57] there there's a lot of difference
[29:59] between God putting his name there and
[30:01] somebody putting their name there his
[30:04] name there see we must remember that God
[30:08] said he would put see I have put my name
[30:11] I will put my name in this place and
[30:14] that's the place that I choose I have
[30:18] chosen the people should work that
[30:21] people should worship in other words
[30:23] I've chosen the place that they should
[30:26] worship and I have chosen the people who
[30:30] will worship you understand me
[30:33] so even though your worship see that's
[30:36] what I'm saying when God chooses a
[30:39] worshiper he chooses the right worshiper
[30:42] you understand what I'm saying
[30:44] God don't have to beg a real worshiper
[30:47] that he have chosen the worship because
[30:49] they must manifest the word and they
[30:52] must worship it's part of the choosing
[31:00] it's part of the choosing you and I what
[31:04] hey listen that that will be done in
[31:08] earth as it is in heaven
[31:10] is that right God always had worshipers
[31:14] in heaven he had agency that Seraphim
[31:16] cherubim Zandi you name it but he wanted
[31:19] worshipers in his own image do you think
[31:23] God could choose a worshiper who would
[31:27] not who will not an refuses to worship
[31:32] that's not going to the to the store and
[31:35] buying a toy that can that can shoot
[31:37] boring arrows and you get home in the
[31:41] toy won't work what do you do you take
[31:45] the toy back but see God doesn't make
[31:48] mistakes like that when God chooses the
[31:51] worshiper it is a perfect worship huh
[31:54] you understand me and the greatest
[31:56] worship you can ever give God is for God
[31:59] to live in you that is the highest form
[32:05] of worship is that right or is the truth
[32:11] if you're gonna worship Michael Jackson
[32:13] it's not just just singing his songs but
[32:17] it's to make up yourself like Michael
[32:19] you want to be in the image of Michael
[32:22] now that's just a scenario don't do that
[32:25] but my point is if you wanna worship God
[32:29] you want to be formed into the image of
[32:32] God so you can romp by him talk like him
[32:35] act like him praise like him everything
[32:39] you want to do just like him mm-hmm well
[32:43] Adam said the first child ever come was
[32:46] born in sin so it had to be that line a
[32:51] man that's born of a woman of his of a
[32:53] few days and what full of trouble he's
[32:57] born in sin that's the reason he has to
[33:00] be reborn again yeah if you know if
[33:04] anybody has any understanding you and I
[33:07] know we must be reborn we must have a
[33:10] new birth because there is no way we can
[33:13] make heaven like this right the reason
[33:17] that he has to be reborn again see by
[33:19] the spirit not by a spiritual thought by
[33:23] a spiritual birth see that regeneration
[33:26] reveal excuse me that regenerates him
[33:28] makes him a new creature the first man
[33:32] was born was born in sin then there had
[33:35] to be one come without sex
[33:37] now if sex wasn't the first thing then
[33:41] why did they have to have one in one in
[33:44] sex to redeem the whole human race
[33:49] why didn't
[33:51] he just bring one down the corridor and
[33:53] says here's the just one that that
[33:56] thinks right it had to come through the
[33:59] sex come through women because that's
[34:03] where it come in the first place through
[34:06] sex is that right that in other words
[34:08] that's why God had to bypass right the
[34:13] sexual act but he had to come by way of
[34:16] the woman right
[34:19] we need bypassed the sexual act because
[34:22] that's where the sin came in so he
[34:24] bypassed that so that the one that was
[34:28] to come
[34:28] could be a would be able to redeem all
[34:31] that was born in sex right you said all
[34:37] brother books I don't know well look at
[34:38] the world everything you go everything
[34:41] no matter no matter where you go
[34:43] everything that's advertised his sin it
[34:46] is centered around sex here's the just
[34:51] one that thinks right see right so
[34:54] through sex but brought robbing
[34:57] righteousness and through sex brought
[34:59] righteousness see God without an
[35:01] adulterer a duration without sexual
[35:04] desire brought forth Jesus Christ by
[35:07] Immaculate Conception by overshadowing
[35:10] Mary and creating in her this baby that
[35:13] come that come by sex the other would
[35:18] understand what he's saying every child
[35:20] from that point came by way of sex
[35:22] except this one and through that his
[35:28] holy blood redeemed the whole fallen
[35:31] racy so it has to be no other way for it
[35:38] in other words Amen Jesus Christ was not
[35:42] a c-section he had to come by way of sex
[35:46] you understand me every man that born of
[35:51] the woman is death bound he's dead when
[35:56] he's born hey it's the truth you know
[36:01] you you you know and I know it meant
[36:03] everything is you
[36:04] go older you realize that death has a
[36:07] hold on you and no matter what you want
[36:10] to do how much you exercise all of that
[36:12] is good but you still getting older
[36:15] you're gonna move slower right you don't
[36:18] even know you're moving slowing do you
[36:19] get grandchildren hallelujah and they
[36:24] just move and you think you can't how to
[36:27] keep up with them kicker
[36:30] whoo yeah but you and I must understand
[36:34] as far as I'm concerned i'ma try not to
[36:37] be here long you and I understand that
[36:40] we are living in the day of the prophecy
[36:43] or the prophecy of Enoch see we moved
[36:49] from Noah's day in that sense
[36:51] Enoch yet is to come and is now right
[36:56] the destruction of the earth not enough
[36:59] a man couldn't toll about Noah's day but
[37:01] he did he came to this day a day when
[37:06] the world was going to finally in right
[37:10] this is what we called the third Exodus
[37:12] right so the first Exodus was by blood
[37:17] by Noah excuse me by water right
[37:21] the second Exodus we know came by what a
[37:23] meant coming out of Egypt it was blood
[37:26] which it was a type of Jesus Christ
[37:29] right when he dropped the blood right
[37:31] now it comes out to the last exit which
[37:34] is the third Exodus and we exit by way
[37:37] of the rapture no hiding place no one
[37:43] could escape by going up over this word
[37:50] a man
[37:51] they escaped out of Egypt by going out
[37:54] and we escape out of this Egypt by going
[37:58] up but we must leave this place because
[38:03] the destroying angel is coming it's
[38:07] already in process remember an eleventh
[38:11] hour remember eight World War one amen
[38:15] the angel stopped did this
[38:18] struction of the world because though
[38:21] that there were Jews the servants had
[38:23] not been sealed by God and the bride of
[38:27] Jesus Christ had not yet been fully made
[38:30] manifest hallelujah and God cannot bring
[38:34] judgment on this earth fully until all
[38:38] whose names are written in the lamp of
[38:41] the life a man had been sealed away and
[38:45] Enoch
[38:47] according to Jews let me read that the
[38:50] Bible said Enoch also the seventh from
[38:53] Adam and this is the seventh church age
[38:56] he may prophesied of these saying behold
[39:00] the Lord cometh with ten thousands of
[39:03] his Saints to do what to execute
[39:06] judgment upon all and to convince all
[39:09] that are ungodly among them all their
[39:12] ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
[39:14] committed and all of their hard speeches
[39:17] which ungodly sinners have spoken
[39:20] against you and I have lived we are now
[39:24] living in an age where Hollywood radio
[39:28] TV churches you name it make mockery of
[39:33] Jesus Christ this is the day they mock
[39:38] God worse than ever they think it's
[39:41] funny they think he doesn't exist they
[39:44] think Amen that this is just some makeup
[39:47] yes they make they mock God in
[39:51] everything no matter what it is they
[39:54] this this is why harsh speeches and and
[39:58] and a profanity against God come on
[40:01] Jelani they prevailed as were they mama
[40:04] they complained listen they Walker that
[40:06] after their own lusts and all of these
[40:09] people still claim to go to church and
[40:11] many of them still say Oh God
[40:17] this is the day and Enoch type the
[40:20] rapture right and you and I know Amen
[40:24] that the Word of God says that our
[40:26] listeners as I read this morning let us
[40:29] be careful and is
[40:31] was it preserved because this is in Jude
[40:34] but juice starts off off with those who
[40:38] are preserved in Christ Jesus and called
[40:42] and then he comes down and he start
[40:45] breaking up said now don't be don't
[40:47] forget be remember now that God when he
[40:50] saved the children out of Egypt he also
[40:53] destroyed them that believed not see but
[40:55] they were preserved only the preserved
[40:58] was kept Joshua and Caleb was kept moses
[41:03] was kept you understand me listen and he
[41:06] goes on and says now remember those
[41:08] angels that that lost their first estate
[41:10] but left their own habitation he have
[41:13] reserved in everlasting chains and
[41:15] darkness unto the judgment of the great
[41:17] day and remember I told you this this
[41:20] morning I said Amen that this this not
[41:22] doesn't just start in in in Eden this
[41:24] start before the foundation in the world
[41:26] because these demons that revolted are
[41:29] the angels that revolted against God and
[41:31] now what we call demons and these demons
[41:34] are now inspiring men and women to do
[41:38] what they did in that other dimension
[41:41] right because the battle first started
[41:44] in heaven it came down to earth we lost
[41:48] the battle in he in Eden hallelujah we
[41:52] failed we broke the word and now the
[41:56] greatest battle ever fought is not an
[41:59] Eden is in your mind it moved from
[42:03] heaven down into Eden from even into
[42:07] your mind because what Satan found a way
[42:11] into the human race hallelujah he cannot
[42:19] destroy the true seed of God because the
[42:22] gene seed is in the soul but he surely
[42:25] can torment you in your mind but don't
[42:33] worry
[42:34] that seed amen the name of the seed has
[42:37] already been placed in the Lamb's Book
[42:39] of Life mmm God preparing us for a new
[42:43] world I'm
[42:44] so excited whoo
[42:47] no wonder Paul said if this Tabernacle
[42:50] be dissolved I have a building I've got
[42:52] one waiting on me I've got a trophy I
[42:55] got a trophy waiting on me from God
[42:57] that's what he says amen if this
[43:00] dissolve I got one up this is not my
[43:03] ending this is only my beginning brother
[43:05] rich it's only our beginning man think
[43:08] about it we got to go through this to go
[43:10] over there hallelujah
[43:12] so let it be hallelujah whenever gotta
[43:15] cut my way to get me over there let it
[43:17] calm whoo I'm a soldier now I'm like
[43:22] Abraham land I'm looking for that city
[43:25] whose builder and maker is God whoo by
[43:31] one man sin entered into the world and
[43:33] death by sin so death passed upon all
[43:36] men for all have sinned is that right
[43:39] and any kept kept them in bondage by law
[43:43] hallelujah you can't do this if you do
[43:45] this that's wrong that's wrong that's
[43:47] wrong you break one word you're guilty
[43:49] of the law therefore you going to hell
[43:51] hallelujah but even in the midst of all
[43:54] that law God had grace is that right
[43:58] because Paul said we're sin did abound
[44:00] grace abounded more hallelujah and when
[44:05] the law was going on yes they tried to
[44:07] make it they tried to do it and when
[44:09] Paul recognized the grace of God he says
[44:11] listen out of all of that I was the
[44:13] worst of all sinners I was a chief of
[44:16] all sinners I did everything right yeah
[44:20] but he thought his righteousness could
[44:22] save him and God revealed to him your
[44:24] righteousness is as filthy rags you
[44:27] can't work it the sea works it it is God
[44:34] in you
[44:35] that's what about calling him the hope
[44:37] of glory hallelujah it is God in you
[44:40] that works this thing to his glory
[44:45] hallelujah if the devil only understood
[44:48] who he's doing he did us a favor when
[44:52] they crucified Christ hallelujah that
[44:54] was the best thing that could have
[44:56] happened
[44:56] when they buried him you talk about a
[45:02] man of war he knows how to fight right
[45:06] under the devil's nose and he's got the
[45:09] devil Amen working to his advantage
[45:11] hallelujah he preached a message
[45:13] he said now what Buster scorned after
[45:15] the body deposit loan but this coin got
[45:17] to go down it's got a dies gallery in
[45:19] order to come up and that devil heard it
[45:21] could not understand it hallelujah if he
[45:24] had understood that message he never
[45:27] would have touched Jesus hallelujah
[45:28] but here come God here come the devil
[45:30] with his imps and his demons amen and
[45:33] they did everything they can do to him
[45:35] but oh my when he gave up the ghost and
[45:38] said it was finished hallelujah oh you
[45:41] know what he was doing he was preparing
[45:43] us he was opening up the Gateway
[45:45] hallelujah to that new dimension
[45:48] hallelujah that new world the world with
[45:51] which we come from did you know that did
[45:55] you know that your theophany was there
[45:57] waiting has been waiting for some time
[46:00] is that right because brother Branham
[46:02] said when God created Adam he created us
[46:05] all all of us oh praise God so when God
[46:16] created Jesus Christ himself
[46:19] even all of us was there that spiritual
[46:23] being that was a quickening spirit amen
[46:25] we were in him is that right for the
[46:28] Lord is that spirit is that right the
[46:30] Lord is that spirit we are part of him
[46:35] that brother I'm said we're rotational
[46:37] for him so you got to understand having
[46:40] the Holy Ghost getting the Holy Ghost is
[46:42] not your problem it's God's problem
[46:46] and God has no problems that means if
[46:52] God has ordained you together you gonna
[46:54] get it and the gates of Hell should not
[46:56] prevail because you know what you and I
[47:02] know where the place of worship is was
[47:05] that right jesus said if you call on my
[47:08] name you asked me for bread he said know
[47:10] I will never give you a serpent I never
[47:13] understood that brother when you asked
[47:16] for life God is not going to make you a
[47:17] devil if you ask for life God will give
[47:26] you life whoo glory to God is that
[47:31] Alright
[47:32] see one thing I love about it because
[47:34] God through what this whole book was
[47:36] trying to show us listen you can't do it
[47:38] I want you to understand I am the real
[47:40] Romeo I'm the one I'm the real true
[47:43] lover hallelujah
[47:45] I'm the one that searches for you you
[47:47] don't search for me I came looking for
[47:49] you because I've known you before the
[47:52] foundation of the world
[47:53] and understand that this city that we're
[47:56] building has always been my plan
[48:00] hallelujah this whole new world that's
[48:03] coming has always been my plan y'all
[48:06] understand me God works in three he had
[48:09] to have three he had to have a rise in
[48:11] the fall or rise in the fall all right
[48:13] you know him said he had to work in
[48:15] threes because three is perfection this
[48:20] is the third Exodus and this is a final
[48:23] one hallelujah and every name that's on
[48:27] the Lamb's Book of Life amen when God
[48:30] called us from the grave you hear what
[48:32] I'm saying see this is what Adam was
[48:35] supposed to do that's why brother mom
[48:37] said those children were supposed to be
[48:38] excuse me spoken word children and when
[48:43] I when God amen is that right because
[48:46] remember God God told us something that
[48:49] we didn't know he said Adam was all he
[48:53] was there before he was formed
[48:55] he was already made in the image of God
[48:58] which was spirit and Adam led those
[49:02] animals before he even was formed in the
[49:07] dust he led those animals like the Holy
[49:10] Ghost would lead us that's what he said
[49:12] it hallelujah and then God formed him
[49:16] out of the dust of the earth so that he
[49:18] could feel and be touched by the
[49:20] feelings by the infirmities or whatever
[49:22] he wanted to
[49:24] communicate with his creation fellowship
[49:28] with him he wanted to be able to touch
[49:31] the deer and touch the antelope and
[49:34] whatever more he want to become visible
[49:37] to his creation so that they could see
[49:39] him is that right the same thing God did
[49:42] he was spirit he is spirit but he wanted
[49:46] to be seen he wanted to be touched
[49:49] hallelujah he wanted us to know him and
[49:52] to understand him and this what's of
[49:55] what was of what was what the fall was
[49:58] all about hallelujah
[50:00] but the world to come was always in the
[50:03] mind of God it's not so I better create
[50:06] a new world no the original thing
[50:09] planned was always out there and
[50:12] redemption of that had to be made that's
[50:15] why I said this morning there will not
[50:18] be any babies no toddlers over there
[50:22] because Adam was formed out of the dust
[50:25] of the ground and he was not a toddler
[50:27] he was a man that was a pattern of God
[50:31] that when one would come from the dust
[50:33] it would be a man or woman somebody help
[50:38] me here this is why the second Adam
[50:41] became a quickening spirit he could not
[50:44] just have babies by sex but he's got to
[50:46] come back and call us like Adam would
[50:49] have called us from the dust of the
[50:51] earth we are now in existence we are not
[50:55] the orphanage commotion body we stand in
[50:59] that dimension right now well how do you
[51:01] know cuz brother owns a when he went
[51:03] behind the curtain of time we were there
[51:05] but we were in our theophanies
[51:08] hallelujah but one of these old days God
[51:11] will call us by name hallelujah and what
[51:16] is the name the name is the Lord Jesus
[51:19] Christ
[51:20] it is the only redemption name and the
[51:23] Bible said neither is there salvation in
[51:25] any other but there is no other name
[51:28] given them a man why we must be saying
[51:32] and I was
[51:32] when he call him callers like avarice
[51:35] Lazarus right he's not gonna call all
[51:38] these names it would take forever
[51:43] you're welcome with Jesus you're working
[51:46] with the Archangel he will call one name
[51:49] and the whole body of people who come
[51:52] from the dust of the earth because they
[51:54] died in his name they will rise in his
[51:58] name hallelujah he won't have to say
[52:04] this time
[52:05] lucemon let him go no sir why because
[52:08] this model will put on immortality well
[52:12] that the Alpha me will put on a
[52:14] glorified body hallelujah it will drop
[52:17] this old nasty thing we're now causing
[52:19] calling our house you see it's a
[52:25] beautiful plan and those of us who are
[52:28] making preparations that old colored man
[52:32] say I don't want no trouble at the river
[52:35] if I got any problem let me settle him
[52:38] now because when it comes for me to
[52:41] cross over I don't want no trouble at
[52:44] the river
[52:44] whew am I the only one feeling good Oh
[52:49] [Laughter]
[52:51] Lord it's a beautiful thing that that's
[52:56] why the scripture says he makes all
[52:57] things beautiful in his time hallelujah
[53:02] see what it is it's a finished product
[53:05] and brothers and sisters we must begin
[53:09] to think like this because the devil
[53:13] will hide the fact that you got the Holy
[53:15] Ghost by way of your doubt as long as he
[53:21] can keep you doubting that you have it
[53:23] you won't be able to use it you become
[53:26] fearful you don't I mean a year he stunt
[53:30] your growth hittin your he stunts amen
[53:33] the glory of God that would normally
[53:34] come out of you because what he does he
[53:37] looks and makes you look at your flesh
[53:39] and you forget your flesh is already
[53:41] condemned that old boy could never do
[53:43] nothing good hallelujah he
[53:46] real enemy hallelujah yes it is the holy
[53:50] is the spirit and the flesh that war
[53:52] gives each other
[53:53] amen and you can never put this amen
[53:56] convert it that's why God got to change
[53:59] it he can convert the heart he can give
[54:02] you a new spirit but the flesh cannot be
[54:04] converted it must die and rot somebody
[54:10] help me here see in order to put on
[54:13] Christ
[54:14] you got a dying rot hallelujah to your
[54:18] flesh and God will give you the grace to
[54:21] do it the seed in you is the conqueror
[54:25] the Christ in you is the Conqueror when
[54:29] he said you might he's a mighty
[54:31] Conqueror he's a mighty Conqueror why
[54:34] because he conquered death hell and the
[54:36] grave hallelujah and when he did that he
[54:39] conquered the effects of death held in
[54:42] the grave that's why we'll be changed
[54:46] because he not only conquered death hell
[54:49] and the grave but he conquered the
[54:50] effects of death hell and the grave hey
[54:54] somebody help me here see so you and I
[54:57] must understand is a finished product he
[55:01] lived he died he rose again a sitting
[55:03] into heaven has come back in the form
[55:05] that the Holy Ghost so it is a finished
[55:08] work with God Christ knowing no sin
[55:11] became my sin wait a minute hallelujah
[55:17] he became my sin and what is sin not
[55:21] cheating in lying and stealing sin is
[55:24] unbelief he became my unbelief that I
[55:28] might have faith is that right that's
[55:32] why the Bible said when we are weak he
[55:34] is strong he's home it's not your faith
[55:39] anymore he's relying upon is his faith
[55:42] he is relying upon know he became sin
[55:48] that I might stand in his place he took
[55:51] my place I was in him at Calvary when he
[55:55] died there I must die with him to live
[55:58] because the law
[56:00] and death is in the body you have to die
[56:03] to be reconciled to him whoo talking
[56:09] about a recreation I am so excited I'm
[56:14] excited now because now I see all the
[56:17] trials and tests I go through it's a
[56:19] part of God we creating me it's killing
[56:22] and killing the old stuff and bringing
[56:24] forth the new is that right brother Adam
[56:27] said the new the new being a new
[56:30] creation creature they're the Greek
[56:32] words saying new creation it's a new
[56:35] creation
[56:36] you have been recreated again from what
[56:39] you were to the image of the Son of God
[56:41] and a daughter of God it's just such an
[56:45] all it's the greatest miracle that ever
[56:48] happened when a sinner can be made to
[56:51] become a Christian the greatest miracle
[56:55] in ain't opening up the blind eyes it's
[56:58] not delivering somebody from drugs is
[57:00] with a man and a woman becomes a
[57:03] Christian he said that is the greatest
[57:06] of all miracles hmm and what we find
[57:10] ourselves doing is grieving the Holy
[57:12] Ghost you think you don't have him
[57:13] because the devil say he ain't there and
[57:15] God says he is there and then you do
[57:18] things and all you do is grieving him
[57:20] because you're not believing that he's
[57:21] in you he can't leave you once he's in
[57:25] there the Bible said he said I'll not
[57:27] leave you never will I forsake you
[57:31] that's the word he can't once God has
[57:34] decided to come in he's there to stay he
[57:40] can't make a mistake oh I better get up
[57:41] out of here
[57:42] oh no once he comes into your heart he
[57:47] has bind bound himself bind himself to
[57:51] stay mmm
[57:55] is a dare you try to break that seal you
[58:00] can't
[58:03] come on somebody grieve not the Holy
[58:07] Spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[58:09] unto the day of your Redemption argue
[58:12] with him not me that's what he says I'm
[58:15] reading it reading it alright you sealed
[58:17] unto the day of your redemption until
[58:20] the day that Jesus comes for you think
[58:23] of it you are then not yourself you are
[58:26] a new creature a Greek the Greek word
[58:29] means a new creation
[58:30] you've been recreated again listen what
[58:33] I'm gonna say here look what is being
[58:34] said here now he said the power of God
[58:37] comes upon you and you become created a
[58:40] new creature the power of God comes upon
[58:43] you which brings the whole physical
[58:46] being spiritual being and everything in
[58:49] subject to the Word of God not another
[58:53] way there's no other way so what are you
[58:56] trying to say sometimes it takes a while
[58:59] for God to bring a person to a maturity
[59:04] sometimes some people are faster than
[59:07] others that's just in the natural and
[59:09] it's that way in the spiritual some
[59:11] people right you said what do you mean
[59:14] well Thomas says I ain't believing it
[59:16] but he's seen all the other miracles the
[59:19] other ones did see right
[59:21] he saw them but when they told him in
[59:25] the resurrection time believing that man
[59:27] I'm more intelligent than that you know
[59:31] what I'm saying the only way I'm gonna
[59:32] believe this I gotta feel it I gotta put
[59:35] my hand and so God has to deal with
[59:37] people like that
[59:38] God gonna he won't lose one but whatever
[59:42] it takes to convince the person or the
[59:45] people and bring their faith level up to
[59:47] the place where God wants it to be God
[59:49] will do it right oh and yes what God
[59:56] said in Thomas you blessed he doesn't
[1:00:00] hold cursing Thomas you didn't even
[1:00:01] believe it
[1:00:02] no he blessed it Thomas you blessed now
[1:00:05] now that you see you can call me my lord
[1:00:07] my god but he said blessed is the man
[1:00:10] who have not seen yet believe see but
[1:00:15] you said what brother one better than
[1:00:16] the other
[1:00:17] all I can tell you they both blessed
[1:00:20] he's the way you want to look at it
[1:00:22] they both blessed one that see the
[1:00:24] supernatural is blessed and the one that
[1:00:26] doesn't see the supernatural whatever it
[1:00:28] takes to bring him bring him to the
[1:00:30] Blessed state so be it well them say God
[1:00:38] promised it and God is obligated to take
[1:00:42] care of it he puts everything back on
[1:00:47] God and I think you need to do the same
[1:00:49] thing put everything back on God right
[1:00:51] you and I must understand that I'm
[1:00:53] almost done with this but you must
[1:00:55] understand that what God is doing
[1:00:57] he's transplanting us right God could
[1:01:03] have killed everything in Noah's day
[1:01:04] including Noah and he could have started
[1:01:07] up with a new makeup from the dust of
[1:01:10] the earth but God took Nora from the old
[1:01:13] world and plant transplanted him into
[1:01:16] the new right amen because Nora was a
[1:01:20] royal seed right so what God is doing
[1:01:24] now amen and everybody that died from
[1:01:28] Noah all the way up that was believe us
[1:01:31] God preserved them you said well oprah's
[1:01:36] what do you say let me tell you
[1:01:37] something job is the oldest of all the
[1:01:40] books and Joel had a revelation of the
[1:01:43] lamb you understand me so they didn't
[1:01:47] have novels and everything else it was
[1:01:49] word of mouth they passed us this
[1:01:51] message this message on the blood of the
[1:01:54] lamb is what God is pleased with and
[1:01:57] here was Joel a faithful servant of the
[1:02:00] Lord recognizing he was a sinner and he
[1:02:03] needed a blood atonement hallelujah
[1:02:06] not just for himself but for his whole
[1:02:08] family and like I said this morning he's
[1:02:11] paid on that as cheap hallelujah
[1:02:14] constantly presenting to God those
[1:02:17] sacrifices burnt sacrifice Lord forgive
[1:02:20] me love if I've seen in any way forgive
[1:02:22] me life he kept praying not for just
[1:02:24] himself but for his children and because
[1:02:27] of the Ashi because of his prayer
[1:02:31] his children were saved he loves
[1:02:33] somebody even when they were out there
[1:02:35] partying is there anything too hard for
[1:02:42] God hallelujah I'm almost done in just a
[1:02:46] minute so what God does like I said this
[1:02:48] morning a man he transplant us he
[1:02:51] preserves us now he's got us in a place
[1:02:53] called under the altar we're in that 60
[1:02:56] minute when we leave here we go and we
[1:02:58] right under the altar right under the
[1:03:00] weather seventh years but God has us
[1:03:02] preserved there and I want you to
[1:03:03] understand it's beautiful over there
[1:03:06] it's not a prison house it's a paradise

[1:03:21] who die before the coming of the Lord
[1:03:23] hallelujah but when God get ready and
[1:03:29] he's calling the Bible said when that
[1:03:31] trumpet sound and when God called for
[1:03:34] those that is that right because you got
[1:03:37] to realize by God's grace Amen when
[1:03:40] Jesus comes as he called Lazarus he will
[1:03:43] call us hmm
[1:03:46] yes cuz you said where I don't know
[1:03:48] about listen the Bible said Lazarus was
[1:03:50] dead for days he's thinking right the
[1:03:54] Word of God fell in the ground and was
[1:03:57] in that ground for four days before God
[1:04:01] called Luther stinking stinking and
[1:04:07] luthor was one that brokers kind of free
[1:04:09] life struck us amen it was a just shall
[1:04:13] live by faith

[1:04:24] out of the grave and we stand there in
[1:04:27] grave clothes and gossiped loose him and
[1:04:30] let him go hallelujah but who said loose
[1:04:35] him it was Mary Martha it was the voice
[1:04:38] of the Archangel come on somebody and
[1:04:42] that's how it is it was the voice of the
[1:04:45] that said lose him come out of those
[1:04:48] organization come out of those
[1:04:49] denomination you are set free God is
[1:04:54] calling you to the marriage supper of
[1:04:56] the Lamb
[1:04:56] is that right cuz you'll find out the
[1:04:58] next thing that that the scene of Elijah
[1:05:02] was that he was sitting at the supper
[1:05:03] table with Jesus you and I must
[1:05:10] understand this thing is perfect it's
[1:05:13] perfect
[1:05:14] and right now God is now preparing of
[1:05:17] people that's why I didn't listen let me
[1:05:18] find that quote brother Branham said
[1:05:20] like this he said the bride is the only
[1:05:21] one that can see it the denomination's
[1:05:24] came in company and what's happening now
[1:05:29] is that all right they can't see it
[1:05:33] people
[1:05:35] he said God's great secret has always
[1:05:38] blinded the wisdom of the world they
[1:05:41] can't get it they just don't understand
[1:05:44] it Satan don't understand it though none
[1:05:49] of the rest of them understanding but
[1:05:51] just those who are predestinated to
[1:05:53] understand it how God in Christ are one
[1:05:57] hallelujah they'll make him three every
[1:06:00] time yeah they certainly will but the
[1:06:05] bride of Jesus Christ knows that God in
[1:06:08] Christ is one a man the god of Jehovah
[1:06:12] the Old Testament is in Jesus Christ of
[1:06:14] the new hallelujah why she's married to
[1:06:18] him
[1:06:20] mmm hallelujah they can't even
[1:06:24] comprehend it hallelujah I'm a closed on
[1:06:29] this quote because what we are becoming
[1:06:33] we are becoming the perfection of the
[1:06:36] Son of man you understand what that is
[1:06:39] the perfection of beasts on a man not
[1:06:42] the one a the perfection of the son of
[1:06:45] man who is Jesus Christ I'm gonna read
[1:06:49] you the quote in just a minute I want
[1:06:51] you to understand amen we are becoming
[1:06:53] the perfection of the Son of Man this is
[1:06:57] why everything that is
[1:06:59] of darkness has to go and you and I
[1:07:02] it'll happen
[1:07:03] it is simple you ask not you have not
[1:07:06] you ask he'll give it mmm
[1:07:10] he will do it if you really are sincere
[1:07:14] God would do it but guess what in his
[1:07:16] time he makes all things beautiful oh no
[1:07:21] he huh
[1:07:22] see that's what people say what Saul
[1:07:23] said well your Saul says Samuel is not
[1:07:26] back in you know they said we'll make a
[1:07:28] sacrifice at me yet what was also well
[1:07:31] yeah let me do it see no Sam you said
[1:07:34] he'll be back you better wait Oh Samuel
[1:07:38] it's all messed up because he didn't
[1:07:40] understand it would have been far more
[1:07:42] beautiful he would remain King if he had
[1:07:46] only stayed obedient to the voice of the
[1:07:49] prophet in closing but he promised just
[1:07:58] before the coming of the end time the
[1:08:00] world would get like it was in Sodom
[1:08:03] when a man came down in human form three
[1:08:06] of them two angels and God himself
[1:08:09] you understand me so when brother
[1:08:13] Brandon was on scene and God moved that
[1:08:16] was God himself he wasn't all robbers he
[1:08:19] wasn't a Billy Graham three came down
[1:08:20] and God Himself came right right
[1:08:27] amen that was God the Bible said it was
[1:08:31] now he came down and he manifested
[1:08:34] himself there by turning his back to the
[1:08:36] tent where Sarah was and told Abraham
[1:08:39] and Sarah what was what was thinking in
[1:08:41] the tent now you tell me
[1:08:42] God didn't have to do it but that
[1:08:44] prophet stood on that stage and he
[1:08:46] turned his back and he started calling
[1:08:48] people out by name where they were
[1:08:50] sitting and everything else that was not
[1:08:52] a man that was God he was trying to show
[1:08:56] us that a son of man but he showed that
[1:08:58] the son of man was on the scene and at
[1:09:03] that day when the son of man is being
[1:09:04] revealed in other words the son of man
[1:09:07] the Ministry of Jesus Christ himself
[1:09:10] the church here it is
[1:09:12] we'll come through justification through
[1:09:15] luther through sanctification through
[1:09:18] Wesley through the baptism of Holy Ghost
[1:09:21] in the Pentecostals and go right on into
[1:09:25] the perfection of the Son of man that
[1:09:29] when husband and wife hello will be the
[1:09:33] same self person God will be so
[1:09:37] manifested in his bride his church -
[1:09:41] they will both be the same they are one
[1:09:43] he said now you see where we had she'd
[1:09:47] this is what the message came for them
[1:09:51] and you see the son of man was not only
[1:09:53] just a prophet but he also had the
[1:09:55] ability of discernment every Christian
[1:09:58] that's really born of the message born
[1:10:00] of the word amen has deserved
[1:10:02] they got Christ how can you not have it
[1:10:05] in you this is not a one-man ministry
[1:10:08] anymore this is a body ministry and
[1:10:13] everything that was in Christ is that
[1:10:15] right he poured it into up the church he
[1:10:21] didn't say something he said everything
[1:10:24] this is what makes us a super Church
[1:10:27] this is what makes us a super race
[1:10:31] hallelujah because we're packing the
[1:10:34] blood of Jesus is that right the prophet
[1:10:37] of God said the bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:10:39] the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit
[1:10:43] somebody help me here and we are coming
[1:10:46] into that perfection and whether you
