[0:48] collector of
[0:49] sentences amen what it means look it up

[1:04] it is amen amen it's tried and true it's
[1:08] been
[1:09] tested praise the Lord I just uh I'd
[1:13] like to uh first uh maybe just a little
[1:16] bit different with the PowerPoint but uh
[1:18] I'm sure uh uh it'll it'll be a blessing
[1:21] especially uh maybe to the little ones
[1:25] uh and I don't know about you but I'm a
[1:27] little one amen amen and so uh uh
[1:30] brother you may be so revelated you
[1:32] don't need it but just close your eyes
[1:36] then amen praise the Lord we're going to
[1:39] look here very familiar scripture uh
[1:42] let's let's put that put that down just
[1:44] a little
[1:47] bit
[1:49] see there we go all right Luke chapter
[1:53] 23 verse
[1:57] 32 and there were also two two other
[2:00] maleactors LED with him to be put to
[2:04] death and when they were come to the
[2:07] place which is called
[2:09] Calvary There They Crucified him the
[2:14] male factors one on the right hand and
[2:17] the other on the
[2:19] left then said Jesus father forgive them
[2:24] for they know not what they do and they
[2:26] parted his reignment and cast lots
[2:30] and the people stood
[2:32] beholding and the rulers also with them
[2:36] derided him saying he saved others let
[2:40] him save himself if he be the Christ the
[2:43] chosen of God and the soldiers also
[2:47] mocked him coming to him and offering
[2:49] him vinegar and saying if thou be the
[2:53] king of the Jews save thyself and the
[2:56] superscription also was written over him
[2:59] in letters of Greek greek latin and
[3:01] Hebrew this is the king of the
[3:04] Jews and the one of the male factors
[3:07] which were hanged railed on him saying
[3:10] if thou be Christ save thyself and us
[3:15] but the other answered rebuking him
[3:18] saying Dost not thou fear
[3:22] God now let's think about this friends
[3:25] there is not a a a uh a situ situation
[3:30] where Christ is is in the temple and
[3:33] robed in his robe without a seam and uh
[3:37] looking uh uh as we would say anointed
[3:39] in fresh for the service but this is
[3:43] where the Bible said his viage was
[3:46] marred more than any other man that when
[3:49] this man could look at Christ he he was
[3:53] he was he was so disfigured he didn't
[3:55] even look like a man but this thief
[3:58] could look at Christ in that condition
[4:02] and see something more than just a
[4:06] man he saw
[4:09] God praise the Lord he said he said does
[4:13] not thou fear God seeing thou in the
[4:17] same
[4:19] condemnation
[4:22] amen talk about
[4:24] predestination and
[4:26] election he gives us eyes to see amen
[4:30] and here's to hear he said and we indeed
[4:34] justly for we receive the due reward of
[4:37] our Deeds but this man have done nothing
[4:41] a
[4:42] miss and he said unto Jesus Lord
[4:46] remember me when thou comest into thy
[4:52] kingdom I'd like to speak to you this
[4:56] morning by the help of the Lord on a on
[4:57] a thought of
[5:01] needing needing a
[5:03] savior let's just bow our heads in word
[5:06] of
[5:07] prayer precious Lord we love you God
[5:10] today Lord I just pray that you would be
[5:14] behind this pull pit
[5:16] Lord God that you would have your way in
[5:18] this service Lord we appreciate the
[5:21] songs and we appreciate the saving power
[5:24] Lord of your love and truth and we just
[5:26] pray that it' be displayed this morning
[5:28] God we love you and committ into your
[5:30] hands and pray that you'd have your way
[5:32] we ask these things to be so in the name
[5:34] that's above every name our Lord and
[5:36] Savior Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord
[5:40] you can be seated if you
[5:43] like needing a
[5:45] savior and uh be before I I I I get into
[5:49] this thought I I I want to give you just
[5:52] a little uh a little preview of this
[5:55] evening's thought um I I want to speak
[5:59] to you tomorrow or this evening uh on on
[6:02] a little thought called emotions of
[6:05] Christ and uh I I really really want to
[6:10] admonish you to to come back this
[6:12] evening
[6:13] service uh uh don't don't uh take a rest
[6:18] but please come back to the house of God
[6:20] tonight not not for my glory but but I I
[6:24] I can promise you if you love the Lord
[6:26] Jesus tonight's service will bless your
[6:29] heart
[6:30] it'll it'll give you and I uh I I I I
[6:34] don't want to go too much into it but uh
[6:36] I I spent a uh a greater portion of a of
[6:39] a year off and on studying the gospels
[6:42] looking at every time Christ had a
[6:44] motion displayed in the word and um it
[6:48] it was absolutely it absolutely
[6:50] transformed my perception of Jesus
[6:53] Christ and who he is and and I'm
[6:56] positive that it'll it'll give you a
[6:58] different insight to your lord and
[7:00] savior if you'll just come back and and
[7:03] and and be a part of the service so I
[7:04] just want to encourage you to do that uh
[7:07] tonight but uh Tom tonight this morning
[7:10] uh we're going to look at needing a
[7:12] savior and uh uh how many needs a savior
[7:16] this
[7:17] morning amen uh I I I know and don't get
[7:22] me wrong as as we uh just maybe to give
[7:24] you a little
[7:25] disclaimer uh I realize uh before you
[7:28] start putting quotes together in your
[7:30] mind that we were saved in in before the
[7:32] foundation of the world is that right I
[7:35] I realized that but but still and and
[7:38] yet uh even though that be true we still
[7:41] need a savior this morning is that right
[7:45] uh I need him every day of my life uh I
[7:49] know he was there before the world ever
[7:50] was but I needed to be displayed AR
[7:52] fresh today in
[7:55] 2014 is that right and and so uh uh
[7:59] brother brandham tells us this that in
[8:02] the beginning there was nothing but God
[8:04] and in God was attributes his attribute
[8:07] to be a savior we know it so he is a
[8:10] savior and that was in him and there was
[8:13] nothing lost to be saved in him was
[8:15] attributes to be father and there was
[8:18] nothing he could father in him was
[8:21] attributes to be healer there was
[8:23] nothing lost nothing sick so the only
[8:27] thing he could do was make man in the B
[8:29] basis of free moral agency knowing he
[8:32] would do
[8:34] it God didn't do it himself man done it
[8:39] himself and you're the same way this
[8:43] morning you can accept life or you can
[8:46] turn it down amen but God made man thus
[8:51] that he knowing he would do it not
[8:55] willing that he should do it but knowing
[8:57] he would do it that it would display his
[9:01] attributes so there's nothing out of
[9:06] time everything is ticking there's
[9:09] nothing out of time everything is
[9:12] ticking just exactly according to God's
[9:15] great time piece see and this only
[9:18] displays his attributes to select his
[9:22] children who really love him and believe
[9:26] him amen and so we we we we uh uh
[9:31] Realize by the message of God that that
[9:35] uh uh God uh had to uh you know we think
[9:40] so much of of us needing to be saved
[9:44] right but there's another aspect of it
[9:47] that God needed someone to
[9:50] save there was a part of him that he had
[9:55] to have something to save amen and so
[9:59] there was a deep calling out to a deep
[10:02] not just in us but in
[10:05] him amen and I believe all through
[10:09] Christ uh Earthly Ministry that even
[10:13] though now right now he is a blood
[10:16] blanner over the Earth interceding for
[10:19] us this morning amen but when he was on
[10:23] Earth his whole life and Ministry was to
[10:27] express a savior yeah
[10:29] whether it was healing a little boy or
[10:32] or though he had 99 sheep it just wasn't
[10:36] enough why cuz he's not satisfied with
[10:39] 99% amen he's not satisfied with
[10:44] 99.9 amen but he's got to had the full
[10:48] 100
[10:50] amen and he wants to be a savior this
[10:53] morning if you don't know Jesus Christ
[10:56] in the power of His Saving Grace I
[10:59] believe this morning is your
[11:02] morning that's right Amen brother
[11:05] brother brother Brenham tells us this he
[11:07] says you see now now why thank you
[11:10] brother he says you see now why that
[11:12] that man was more than just a teacher as
[11:15] people say he is today a philosopher a
[11:19] good man or a prophet he was
[11:23] Emmanuel he was the son of God which is
[11:26] Jehovah God made manifest in his
[11:28] attributes to display himself in a body
[11:31] that he built
[11:33] himself amen it reflected now watch this
[11:37] is what God did this is when we see
[11:40] Jesus we see the very Heart Of God is
[11:43] that right amen he says he says uh uh he
[11:47] says uh and the sinful nature of man
[11:51] could not do the thing that he did so it
[11:53] had to be God making reflecting himself
[11:56] in a man making a miracle
[12:00] that we might see that perfect man which
[12:03] is
[12:04] Christ yes this doing that reflected his
[12:09] Noble loving
[12:11] character seeing him was attribute as a
[12:15] savior and it had to display
[12:20] itself you know I I I I I I the Lord
[12:24] started dealing with my heart on this
[12:26] several months ago and I've been saved
[12:28] since
[12:30] 2001 and I I think it's uh something
[12:34] that we as uh Christians we all go
[12:38] through because a thought like this is
[12:41] very
[12:43] uh um real to us when we first get
[12:49] saved but as we get a few years on us I
[12:53] believe we start leaning on our own arm
[12:55] of
[12:56] Flesh maybe not consciously but sub
[12:59] consciously can you say
[13:01] amen and and and and you know I I
[13:04] believe it this morning you know God is
[13:07] not a disgruntled savior that's right
[13:10] God's not disgruntled that that he saved
[13:12] that he sent his own son that he could
[13:14] save us God so loved you that he sent
[13:17] his son and we need a savior this
[13:19] morning we can be as predestinated as we
[13:22] want to but we need a savior I believe
[13:25] message people get so predestinated that
[13:27] they no longer need a savior but I need
[13:29] a savior this morning I need Jesus
[13:33] Christ I don't know the way of a Rapture
[13:36] without my savior taking me by the hand
[13:40] and leading me and guiding me to that
[13:43] Promised
[13:44] Land amen his whole life was to express
[13:49] salvation to save men and women from
[13:54] sin
[13:56] amen the Bible said he had a need to go
[13:59] by
[14:00] Samaria and when he sat on that whale
[14:03] exhausted being wearied from his journey
[14:07] brother Benham tells us this in several
[14:09] places in the message that he was
[14:12] actually on his road to Jericho but God
[14:15] gave him a vision and then he had a need
[14:17] to go by
[14:18] Samaria is that right and so God this
[14:22] morning friends God will change his
[14:24] direction to come savior he'll go way
[14:28] out of his way to come save you don't
[14:31] hey don't take my word for it but I want
[14:34] you to look at the wrong map this
[14:36] morning and believe for
[14:38] yourself cuz the look at here look he
[14:41] said he he was brother man said he was
[14:43] on his road to
[14:45] Jericho but he had a need to go by
[14:51] Samaria
[14:54] glor Hallelujah Hall amen friends
[14:59] he was on his road to
[15:01] Jericho but he would go three times out
[15:04] of his way to
[15:06] Samaria for a
[15:08] [Applause]
[15:13] harlot he he didn't have no
[15:17] Cadillac he had no Cadillac to run
[15:19] through the car wash for his
[15:26] Samaria but he'll go a long way
[15:30] out of his way to save
[15:33] you cuz that's what he is he's the
[15:39] Savior praise the Lord he'll go way out
[15:42] of his way
[15:43] friends cuz he has a need to be a savior
[15:48] cuz that's what he
[15:51] is but we as
[15:54] man we as men we all battle with trying
[15:58] to save ourselves
[16:00] eles and if you on the inside of the
[16:03] inside says oh no not me you're actually
[16:07] lying to
[16:08] yourself because brother brandham says
[16:10] us tells us
[16:12] this and he talks about this all
[16:14] throughout the message this is just one
[16:15] quote he says man's always trying to
[16:18] find someone some way to save himself
[16:20] that's right here it
[16:22] is that's his nature in the Garden of
[16:27] Eden the man as soon as he found out he
[16:29] was lost he made himself a religion a
[16:33] fig Leaf
[16:34] apron and put it over him you see why I
[16:38] think EV was so beautiful see see why
[16:41] don't why I don't think these things the
[16:44] these think of these things these
[16:45] strains now watch brother BR Taps into
[16:48] something that's the strain of man yet
[16:52] tonight amen amen he says even after
[16:57] 4,000 yes nearly 6,000 years man is
[17:01] still trying to cover his own sins by
[17:05] his own
[17:07] merits and and so we uh as and brother
[17:12] you know we all I'm sure we've all know
[17:14] about family
[17:16] strains how many's ever known a family
[17:19] that uh uh you know uh the son acts just
[17:23] like the
[17:26] daddy and daddy acts just just like
[17:30] Grandpa and it's and it may even be
[17:33] unconscious but it's just a family
[17:36] strain is that right now friends listen
[17:39] I don't care uh whether whether we're
[17:41] from Ohio
[17:43] Indiana Carolinas overseas wherever it
[17:47] may be we this is a blanket statement we
[17:50] as Humanity all deal with this strain am
[17:55] you fight this strain because by Nature
[17:58] you want to save yourself am that's
[18:01] exactly right that's why this message
[18:03] came so fresh to me after i' been
[18:05] serving the lord since
[18:07] 2001 because when we get a little season
[18:10] on ourselves we get a few uh uh quotes
[18:13] put together in our mind we have a few
[18:16] doctrines laid out we we may have a few
[18:19] uh little bit of understanding and we
[18:21] begin in our own self to try to Merit
[18:25] our own salvation and place our own eles
[18:29] in the kingdom of God but we still have
[18:32] to be as babes realizing that we need
[18:39] Christ there is no retirement to a
[18:42] Christian there is no 20 years and
[18:46] out I thought you know I remember
[18:48] thinking oh when I stop drinking and
[18:50] drugging then I'll be all
[18:53] right then I thought well when I when I
[18:56] when I when I when I stop having cuss
[18:58] words is going through my
[19:03] mind praise the Lord but when you try to
[19:07] put those landmarks in your Christian
[19:08] walk you'll never be
[19:11] successful because you'll always be
[19:14] grasping you'll always be reaching no
[19:17] matter how listen you may had a good
[19:19] year in
[19:20] 2013 you may have been you may have
[19:22] lived a perfect life in
[19:24] 2013 but listen with when you no matter
[19:28] how well let's say you had a wonderful
[19:30] prayer life but if you really look deep
[19:33] I'm sure there's some areas where you
[19:34] were
[19:35] lacking maybe you didn't get enough give
[19:37] enough
[19:39] offering you you didn't give to the
[19:41] missionaries like you should maybe you
[19:43] didn't have the the relationship with
[19:45] your family and anytime no matter how
[19:49] well we may think we are we remember we
[19:52] the Bible says be ye perfect even as he
[19:55] is perfect and no matter how good we may
[19:58] think we are when we measure up in our
[20:00] own selves to his Perfection we will
[20:04] always come up
[20:06] short
[20:08] amen listen I want to encourage you this
[20:10] morning that the battle is not between
[20:13] you and Satan that's right and the
[20:15] battle certainly isn't between you and
[20:17] God our Prophet preach the message the
[20:20] conflict between God and Satan
[20:22] amen we have to rest in that that it's
[20:26] not our fight it's not our
[20:29] battle I need to be saved friends I need
[20:34] salvation I need something real
[20:37] today I can't go back to
[20:43] 2001 cuz the Bible says today is the day
[20:46] of
[20:49] your praise the
[20:51] Lord but you know man just another quote
[20:55] to back it up notice man has the same
[20:57] six senses he had had 6,000 years ago
[21:00] 6,000 years ago with the senses he had
[21:02] he contacted his Earthly home and served
[21:04] God and now in the past 75 years that
[21:08] man has come from a horse and buggy to
[21:10] an astronaut why he turned away from his
[21:13] faith in God and turned it over to his
[21:16] senses and his ability as a human being
[21:20] did you notice it he quit trusting God
[21:23] and he trusts
[21:25] himself now now remember this was and we
[21:28] gone from a h and buggy to an astronaut
[21:30] and we're in an astronaut age right
[21:32] spiritually speaking but we can still
[21:35] trust spiritually or in our own ability

[25:09] Eternal praise the Lord see God don't
[25:13] just save our soul and make us go
[25:14] through life struggling and stressing
[25:16] and straining but the Bible tells me
[25:19] this the Bible tells me this that he
[25:22] wants to be our savior in all
[25:25] things
[25:27] amen amen
[25:29] is that right he wants to be your
[25:32] savior in all
[25:37] things I don't know about you friends
[25:40] listen he saved me from a life of
[25:42] drugs he saved me from a life of alcohol
[25:46] he saved me from a life of crime he
[25:48] saved me from a life of misery he saved
[25:51] me from a life with no meaning and no
[25:53] purpose he saved me from a life with no
[25:56] substance he saved me from a life of the
[25:58] depression and
[26:00] uncertainty God Is My Savior this
[26:03] morning that's who I trust in that's to
[26:06] I depend upon if I trust in my own self
[26:10] one day I'm up next day I'm down we've
[26:13] got to trust in something
[26:19] higher don't trust in your job I don't
[26:22] care if you got a PhD l
[26:24] d that's still going to fail one day
[26:27] because one day friends if that Soul
[26:29] ain't converted your mind may be lost
[26:32] but if your Soul's converted know if
[26:34] your mind you may be in on aane
[26:35] institution as brother brandham said but
[26:37] that Soul's just as Bound for heaven as
[26:40] there is a
[26:41] heaven amen that's exactly right but we
[26:45] have to have the right perspective
[26:47] because Jesus says this for therefore we
[26:51] both labor and suffer reproach because
[26:53] we trust in the Living God who is the
[26:55] savior of all men
[26:59] especially to those that
[27:03] believe in other words friends how many
[27:05] how many know somebody that God has
[27:07] saved somebody from
[27:09] cigarettes that's all the farther they
[27:14] went cuz he wants to be a savior of all
[27:18] men cuz that savior actually means to be
[27:20] a deliverer or preserver and so many
[27:23] people can feel the the expression the
[27:25] attribute of God as a savior and and
[27:28] maybe get them to sanctification or
[27:30] justification and and and God will save
[27:33] you as much as you allow him to save you
[27:36] because he is a gentleman is that right
[27:40] it's right I believe it friends I I
[27:42] don't know about you but how would we
[27:44] handle the stressful situations that we
[27:47] go through what about that nervous
[27:49] breakdown that you almost
[27:54] had huh praise the Lord what about the
[27:57] time you almost called it quits in your
[28:03] marriage but he
[28:05] was but he was our
[28:07] savior come on friends and we and many
[28:11] times we we think we did it in our own
[28:14] selves but we got to give him
[28:16] praise we got to give him the credit
[28:19] give him the
[28:21] glory amen we need to be more conscious
[28:24] friends he saved us from pitfalls and
[28:27] torments what about that depression you
[28:29] started feeling last Wednesday
[28:35] afternoon but he saved you see because
[28:40] God God don't want you to be
[28:43] frowning

[42:59] the Holy Ghost to keep you HD away in
[43:00] Christ that's the only thing that
[43:03] matters but you know the world wants a
[43:09] Superman the world wants a Superman and
[43:11] it's the voice of
[43:13] Hollywood you know if if you if you look
[43:16] at Superman he's absolutely a blasphemy
[43:19] of Jesus
[43:21] Christ you know if you look at
[43:23] Superman's
[43:25] story he had a a heavenly
[43:28] father and he came to Earth to save the
[43:32] world do you know his Earth you know
[43:34] what his Earthly parents was the ver
[43:35] when Superman was first created is
[43:37] created by two Jewish men and they
[43:39] patterned Superman off of Samson and all
[43:42] the great things of of the Bible they
[43:44] patterned it off of that it's history
[43:47] friends and and so you know when when
[43:50] they first made Superman's uh parents
[43:53] his mama's name was Mary and his daddy's
[43:55] name was Joseph wow
[43:59] Google it out it ain't a hard search oh
[44:02] yeah his and he had a he had a heavenly
[44:07] father but at one time he went to a
[44:09] Wilderness Journey up in the
[44:27] of Superman and then he
[44:30] resurrected oh yeah friends and the
[44:33] religious worlds are eating it up when
[44:36] this movie came out the latest version
[44:38] of it they they actually had a website
[44:40] where where men pastors could get on
[44:42] there and get sermons to preach to their
[44:44] congregation and and and they said if
[44:46] you watch this movie there's all kind of
[44:48] similarities they've got uh Superman uh
[44:52] talking next to a picture of Jesus and
[44:53] he's hanging in a form of a crucifixion
[44:55] and and they were rejoicing ing on the
[44:57] similarities that between and they said
[44:59] that Superman is more spiritual than
[45:01] Jesus Christ because people can relate
[45:03] to Superman than they can oh yeah
[45:05] friends absolutely blasphemy and the
[45:08] world is gobbling it up and I want to
[45:11] say this friends and admonish you this
[45:13] morning if you let your children watch
[45:15] that thing you're absolutely poking
[45:17] perversion down their
[45:20] throats listen you think of it if if the
[45:24] children's groomed for that and they see
[45:25] a Hulk and ible Hulk what does Samson
[45:29] look
[45:34] like if they see Superman and it's a
[45:38] cartoon what about when they see the
[45:40] cartoon of Jesus
[45:43] Christ what it does is it blurs the
[45:46] lines and that's all satan wants to do
[45:49] he wants to make the Bible he wants to
[45:51] make this just another Fable he wants to
[45:55] make this just another fiction story you
[45:59] better be careful with science fiction
[46:00] friends putting that in your children's
[46:02] hands because it blurs the lines and it
[46:05] makes them lose the the precious value
[46:08] of the word of God because this is not a
[46:10] su science fiction this is the
[46:14] supernatural hallelujah praise the Lord

[49:58] savior he said our savior appeared and
[50:01] toward men appeared not by works of
[50:04] righteous which we have done but
[50:06] according to his Mercy he saved
[50:10] us by the washing of regeneration and
[50:13] renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed
[50:16] on us
[50:18] abundantly amen abundantly for not

[53:13] all the waters in the earth let's take
[53:17] that Earth let's take all that water off
[53:20] that
[53:21] Earth he says and the season everything
[53:24] and pile it in one one 4T pipe and pick
[53:29] it up there the pressure would be at the
[53:33] bottom of it trying to find a little
[53:36] crevice to leak its way
[53:38] through that's like the pressure of the
[53:41] Holy Spirit trying to come down on every
[53:45] life that
[53:48] pipe that pipe if you would take that
[53:51] pipe now these these facts have been
[53:55] checked and you would take that pipe
[53:58] You' take all that listen that pipe
[54:00] would go that would go
[54:04] 722 trillion 119 billion 335 million
[54:24] 227,000 light years away
[54:28] and it would have a
[54:30] pressure of one
[54:33] quillion 650
[54:36] quadrillion
[54:38] 938 trillion 110
[54:42] billion
[54:49] PSI
[54:53] Glory that's how bad want God wants to
[54:55] give you the Holy Ghost
[55:00] thank you
[55:02] Lord I I said I showed this slide one
[55:04] time in the church and brother piped up
[55:06] in the crown and goes well that go right
[55:07] through me I'm like no it
[55:11] wouldn't with an attitude like that it
[55:13] won't go through you that's
[55:15] right no it won't the Holy Ghost won't
[55:18] go through not a vessel like
[55:20] that with all that pressure
[55:23] friends there's one thing that keeps
[55:26] with all that pressure we can't listen
[55:29] friends we can't fathom the PSI
[55:33] there but one thing can block all of
[55:37] that and that's your
[55:45] will it's your
[55:47] will cuz God it's his word listen he
[55:51] said he wants to give you the Holy Ghost
[55:54] he wants you to be happy he wants you to
[55:57] have full
[55:58] Joy amen it's stronger than any well
[56:01] that's that's just our family makeup
[56:03] it's stronger than your family makeup
[56:06] yes sir listen friends it it's stronger
[56:08] than anything but the problem of it is
[56:11] it's our will amen it's our hurts we we
[56:17] could we could been hurt way back Yonder
[56:19] and because we was hurt we can shut down
[56:22] from the presence of God
[56:27] but listen that's what the presence is
[56:29] for is to bring
[56:31] healing but it can only heal if you'll
[56:33] allow him to
[56:36] heal praise the
[56:41] Lord the Bible says this for God had not
[56:43] given us a spirit of fear but of power
[56:46] and of love and of a sound mind be not
[56:49] therefore ashamed of the testimony our
[56:51] Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou
[56:54] partaker of the afflictions of the
[56:56] Gospel According to the power of God who
[56:58] have saved us and called us with a holy
[57:00] calling not according to our works but
[57:03] according to his own purpose and Grace
[57:05] which was given us in Christ Jesus
[57:08] before the world ever
[57:12] began when was it given to
[57:15] you man it was his own purpose and Grace
[57:20] and he gave it to you before the world
[57:22] ever was
[57:26] he says but is now made manifest by the
[57:31] appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ so
[57:34] do you understand what I'm saying see
[57:36] how many knows I'm talking about they
[57:37] all you know you know message people can

[57:46] the head knowledge but resentful have
[57:49] all the head knowledge but are
[57:52] miserable and and so and so yes that is
[57:55] all true before the world but there has
[57:56] to come a manifestation of it in our own
[57:59] lives I'm not I'm not talking about work
