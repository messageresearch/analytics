who did not make it last night or yesterday yeah uh you need to get the youtube service it won't be like it was yesterday but you at least get something you know because video don't give you the real thing it's something when you're there in the present yeah and we had a wonderful time i don't know whether there's such thing as an a-plus because god is perfect and that's what we experienced yesterday we experienced the presence of the lord lima ohio i appreciate his uh sacrifice and truly want to encourage him that his coming was not in vain [Music] let god have his way once again this is to impart the word of god to us again [Music] and i want you to show god how much you appreciate him [Music] come on in the presence of jehovah [Music] god [Music] off the key god almighty [Music] [Music] amen god bless you this morning did you have been here just say it's a privilege to be here with you and i really enjoyed myself yesterday it's nice when you know it's nice when you feel the pool [Music] [Music] the disciples were sad they disciplined they had lost their master but he began to walk with them and he began to reveal the word to them and later they confessed that their hearts burned within them because you have to invite the one in who's and when he was behind closed doors privately he took the bread and broke the bread and when he broke the bread it symbolized the breaking of the words not a public revelation but a private revelation and when he broke the word to them their eyes were opened and they knew who this was and i pray that god will break the bread this morning that'll break the bread to you and you'll recognize that that's him if we could all turn while we're standing to the book of genesis genesis 24 and we'll begin reading at 12. we know in genesis 24 that abraham is sending eliezers and he's commanding him to bring us a wife for my son isaac and so that's what's going on in 24. and he says take not a wife from the canaanites take not a wife from the canaan the bride must come from the same family as the group because in this hour the groom come from god and god is the groom's father and so now the bride must be of the same family the same bloodline because there's gonna be no mixing of the bloodlines so the bride must come from the father as well that's why abraham and sarah had the same father amen they were of the same bloodline and the bride of christ and jesus and he kneels down he comes to the well outside of the city and this is what he says and he said oh lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham. behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camel's drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has showed kindness into my mastery of and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebecca came out who was born of bethuel son of milka the wife of nahor abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder palm coffin from and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up with and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pictures and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink. and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for that camels also until they have done drinking and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again into the well to draw water and this morning that we might know you better and that we might understand how you want us to live in this hour we give you preeminence this morning and we yield ourselves into you in jesus it's important the kind of bride that he would be back it is important because this was going to be the bride for his master son we know brother branham was eliezer in time he was sent into the world to fetch a bride for christ and it was a difficult job but eliezer was not going to use his own mind he wasn't going to choose of his own choosing but he prayed god i don't know how to make this choice i need you to choose he said let the one that he left when i asked for her to give me a drink if she says she'll give me a drink but also give water to my camels that'll be the one was looking for somebody that could catch inspiration from god this that was god's choice the one that could read between the lines the one that could catch what the prophet was saying when he wouldn't come right out and say it when he would say i hope you're catching what i'm saying he said one place he said i've said enough that the predestinator will catch it and eliezer said enough so the predestinated brad would catch it and she caught the unspoken part she caught the mystery ela and he knew she was the one so it wasn't eliezer's choosing it was god's jews and how did god reveal his choosing by revelation [Applause] but he was looking for the bride that could catch revelation the one that could catch revelation she was the predestination she was god's choice but let's go over to verse 55. university they go back to the family of rebecca explains his mission and they agree said and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go love and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master number and they said we will call the damsel in inquiry at her mouth and they called rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and she said i will go man amen see brother branham opens with this scripture when he's preaching choosing of a bride and the one who could catch the mystery she would be the bride but she also had to make a choice so there's two sides the choosing of a bride what choice the bride will make the schwa but he said the woman also must choose god [Music] reflects what's in her reflex and god's choice of rebecca illustrated reflects what's in god reflects because your choice reflects what's inside you reflect amen so this morning also i'd like to take for a subject character chooses character the character character chooses characters the choice you make the schwa reveals your character in the smyrnan church out of the church age book don't believe the disaster disagrees that the purpose of god according to election might stand he says that the purpose of god according to election might stand he goes on to say you can't read it any other way is there any greater purpose than the heart purpose when you get to the heart purpose you've gotten to the core you've got to the main point so the heart purpose hello he said the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife it shows what's down is now talking about natural marriage what christ will join himself too will reflect what's in him so if you want to see christ's character look at the bride of his jews because the bride of christ has to reflect his character he says now it is becoming if a christian would choose a wife element don't show it's what she is what makes her sick and what's going to be in the future for his family will be raised by such a woman for the future plans for his home so brother branham is preaching that god's choice for a bride to destroy the jupiter reflects his character and his idea of the future amen he goes on to say he continues now we see plainly the spiritual plan of god's planning for his future home diploma it's showing god's plan for his future with his future bride it's now coming into view on reality you you have to plan if you look and pray when you're choosing for we see by this the word of promise the bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him amen now could you imagine a man filled with the holy ghost taking something like that to be a wife i just don't see it brother now maybe i'm just an old crank a protector but you know i just can't understand that it's going to reflect what's in him she is going to make him she's going to help him make his future home you'll never be happy in the future and heaven is not for you the realm beyond time is not for you because if you cannot fellowship with your brothers here they are the reflection of the future home reflection you can say i want to go to that time that place be on time to the new heavens and do earth [Applause] you'll never be there because your brother is a reflection of god amen amen that's why we believe in fellowship that's why we believe in coming together and having a church it's a reflection of the future homes now we change back now for a moment to the spiritual side and when you see a church that's in the world god's commandments as if he had never wrote them commandments you can just imagine christ is not going to take a bribe like that could you imagine taking the modern church today for a bride if we imagine not my lord i could hardly see that remember now a man and his wife are one. would you join yourself to a person like that if you would it would kind of disappoint my faith in you and then how about god joining himself to something like that a regular denominational prostitute you think he would do it having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof he would never do it she must have his character in her el dorado the real true born-again church must have the character that was in christ because the husband and wife are one basket and if jesus did only that which please god kept his word and manifest his word his bride will have to be of the same character let's turn to john chapter 8. in verse 28 then jesus said unto them when you have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as the father taught me and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him. this was the character of the bridegroom this but the father's idea not his own word but the father's word and he only did that that please the father now that was the character of christ that [Music] not and she will only do that which pleases the father that's the only kind of bride that christ can have every other church was put away she was engaged to be married to christ but she began to take man's ideas and she began to move from the word of god because she couldn't be the right kind of bride predestinated that he will have a bride of his own choosing and she will have the same character that christ she will have the word and the word only no denominational ideas no personal ideas amen let's turn to the book of esther chapter one we know the story of esther it's a type of the bride in chapter one verse five university and when those days are expired the king had made a feast unto all the people that were present in shush and the palace both under great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace capital in verse 9. also vastly the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to the king alzares you see um well the king was having a feast of time the queen had her own feast and she had a feast for the women and the women in the bible's the type of the churches so this queen represents the catholic church and and the seven church ages starts to have her own feasts on the seventh day the seventh age on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded me big that and carcass the seven chamberlain's that served in the presence of azares the king shocked victor to bring vasti the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on typing the seven angels of the seven church age messenger all seven in one day to bring the queen but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlain's therefore was the king very roth and his anger burned in him refused of all the seven church ages the mystery of the seven seals all all seven revealed in this day calling for his queen to come yourself to the commandment of the king so she refused to come at the king's calling and this message is the king's calling through the seven chamberlains unique all calling the bride to come here and she re that she refused to come verse 19 says if it please the king let there be a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before the king azaris and let the king give her royal estate into another that is better than she will be given to another one amen chapter two after these things when the wrath of king azaris was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her appreciations then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king concerned and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins in shusha and the palace to the house of the women and to the custody of haggy the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given and let the maiden which pleases the king be queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so it could have been [Music] and they're gonna and the king's going to choose the one that pleases him he's looking for one that's better than vashti because vashti pleased herself but she's looking this is going to be another type of brother branham because he's going to watch over those virgins and give them what they need for purification they're going are washed by the water of the words washing away all the filth that they brought to the message and they're being anointed with the holy ghost it's their own want to do something so they can bring forth a fragrance up it's now when every maid's turn was to come to go into the king azaris after that she had been 12 months according to the man or the women for so were the days of their purification accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women then thus came every maintenance to the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women into the king's house so after the time of purification when it was her time to go before the king she was allowed to take anything she required anything she desired she had already been brought through purification because everybody has to present themselves to the king the way she thought would be pleasing to the king oh friends we get upset because there's so many differences in the message so many ideas and perverted the pure word that we've got but i tell you it's ordained of god because you can come to the message and you can get any flavor you desire you can choose any idea you can want vicious and you can adorn yourself with that kind of word it proves [Applause] i say it's all of god [Music] let's go over to verse 15. the very now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her first daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her lost king is then they would move to the other house of the concubine and then there was many that were going to be concubine but there was one that was going to be a wife and so when they would come along they would choose whatever they wanted if they wanted a big hair bow a nice necklace a sweet perfume they wanted to wear purple or they wanted to wear red whatever they desired it was given to them and they would go to the kings but when esther came velocity and this bride doesn't want anything but [Music] he this is how he likes for you to dress this is how he likes for you to behave amen amen and esther caught a revelation all the other women missed it [Applause] but i'm going to take from somebody who knows what they're talking about and she required nothing but what heggy i had a point and everybody who saw her she had favor with them there was something different about esther than the rest of the women there was something that made her stand out different and it wasn't her superior beauty they went out to 127 provinces province and they gathered in the most beautiful women from india to ethiopia the most of the world at that time they gathered the most beautiful women from every nation amen and they were going to choose one so it wasn't that esther was beautiful and the rest were not they were all beautiful but there was something different about this one so esther was taken into the king as heiress into his house royal in the tenth month which is the month tibet in the seventh year of his reign is in the seventh year dude so esther is going to meet the king at 10 7 uh at 10 7. revelation 10 7. and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti is she didn't have her own conception she didn't adorn herself according to her own likes but she was reflecting the king's character because i was teaching the king's character and she that didn't want to please herself she wanted to please the king because when the decree went out he was looking for one of the virgins that would please the king not that would please yourself that's why the denominations have been rejected in this day pleasing themselves but god is looking for one that's why he couldn't choose through the church ages you the prophet of god says prophet to judy now we were made for christ christ wasn't made for us that's what we try to do today in our textbooks let's try to make the word which is christ instead of us trying to make ourselves to suit the words that's the difference the bible says that one man was not made for woman but the woman was made for the man and now christ wasn't made for us but the bride was made for christopher [Music] [Applause] and follow i said this is what god is looking for this is what the interpretation of this word stick with the word and the true bride take the word and the word [Applause] [Applause] and they would mix [Applause] [Applause] you better believe that's the color i'm going to wear when how and all the to haggai because he had been there but some were adding their own interpretations but esther was catching it all the other impregnated by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride what is the finished body of jesus christ it's the bride what's the bride impregnated with amen amen the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and his woman is one from infamous and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes one body his mind of course is his will and as well as the word now the word has been restored he don't attract the people at churches that are attracted by big denominations and big doings and being carrying ons and fancy things the shoes but the word of god attracts the bride of christ what do you have to do to find the bride preach the word and live the word it must be preached but it must be preached in the power of the manifestation of the life you can't just speak but you have to because he's looking for his character in and she has to be attracted to his character she has to be of the same character and if she's of the same character [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because of his character character chooses character why were you attracted to this word because the prophet of god showed the character of christ you [Applause] and there's always a conflict inside is it yet but when you saw the character of christ when it was on display and the life of the prophet you say that's the character i'm attracted to [Applause] [Music] that's what i am to meet him in the air amen amen so christ is not complete or christmas in male form only but he must be male and female [Applause] when god would make a man after his own and he was given dominion over all the earth this is the first time in all of god's creations he looks at what he made and he says it's not good how could make any how could god make anything that's not good come on see god said that do at this point so the bride would catch something it's not good that man should dwell alone i will make him a health meet because god wanted beings he could fellowship with you and what his whole plan was going to be so he said i will make a help meet for him so he brought out of the dust to the ground all the animals through these animals and he brought them under adam there was nothing adam could fellowship with person put adam to sleep and he took part of adam and he made the woman and he split his spirit and pulled the feminists over and created the woman out of the man and then he woke at him up hello god [Applause] he wanted a family he wanted something that would come out of him you could unite back with him that he could have fellowship with avec so now he's showing he was foreshadowing i mean what he was going to do in christ when christ was here he was male and female when christ was here i was with him [Applause] and bring the two together so that he could say it's very good so the the body of christ is not finished until the female is finished just like adam wasn't complete just come i don't even complain until eve came on the scene everything they were united together and so now the bride is bringing forth the finished body of christos form of the puzzle and this message has united her back to her head united her back to her mate it was a deep calling to the deep amen so the word of god attracts the bride of christ remember when jesus christ was here he was the manifested word for his day and he chose disciples and those disciples left everything to follow him they saw something in christ that they were willing to leave their businesses their occupations towards the end of the ministry it got difficult and he began to say some things that drive the crowds away and then it wasn't exciting anymore and then jesus said something more difficult and he wasn't explaining he nick speaker he was just speaking and it was driving them away in confusion but then he turned to his disciples [Music] [Applause] what was peter attracted to the [Applause] [Applause] when jesus was no longer working miracles but there was something deeper that was attracting peter yeah anyone come to the testing time when it comes to the hour of disappointment [Applause] this alone is the words of eternal life so the bride is attracted to the word and brotherhood says the true bride attracts the attention of god the attention of the true bride but how does the bride attract the attention of god by keeping his words oh it's that simple by surrendering to the words by submitting to the word how did esther attract the attention of the king by only doing what haggai had appointed what was gleaning in the fields in the fields of boaz her husband was dead she was in poverty she was a single woman and she was young she had nothing but in chapter three verse seven in chapter three naomi gives her instructions this is how i want you to present yourself to boa and ruth has the kind of character [Music] and naomi gives instruction to ruth and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy script over thine handmaid for thou art and near kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has shown more kindness and thy latter end than at the beginning in so much as thou followers not young men whether poor benito eternal mafia sudanese and now my daughter fear not i will do to the all that thou requires for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman the whole city knew she was a virtuous one she held by the thou showed more kindness later than at the beginning because you didn't follow after young men she was a young woman she was a weirdo woman and she wasn't chasing the young man but she was going to the older man she was going back to the right family to the right bloodline because she was interested in one thing to the world or to the flesh but she was going back to the original back to the family back to the near kinsman that could redeem her and she was showing her character by not chasing young men by not chasing all these young ideas all this young interpretation and word decisions she was going back to the word of the father's amen she was going back to the original word she went and laid her feet down at the only place of redemption was back in the bloodline amen back to the place of the father and by laying there she was saying i'm submitting to you i'm laying at your feet and it was showing what character she had there's no beauty if he would have come in worldly beauty as satan is today the people would have run around him and accepted him the way they do the church today they would have believed him and received him as they do satan today christ wasn't beautiful great to make a king out of jesse's son take another king's place and so jesse brought him out hello his great big fine boy and he refused every one of them till he come to a little old stoop shouldered ready looking fellow even cool and he poured the oil upon him yeah literally and he said god chose him see we choose by sight of you god choose by character remember when jesus had to go by samaria there she had had five husbands and the one she was living with then was on her own nobody else could see her true character they all saw the false characters [Applause] [Applause] was a desire for the truth of god but god knew who she was and he began to give her the word and when he began to give her the words she began to respond to the word and then she responded to the word she didn't say tell me my future she didn't say how can i get out of this condition how can i prosper would she come in contact with a prophet she wanted to know one thing she had a desire she didn't want signs and wonders [Applause] through gifts and miracles but we weren't wanting the gifts we wanted to give her we wanted to know the proper place of worship zombies say this oh he was he was he was the s she was giving discernment and he was drawing her in and when he told her the proper place of worship she said when messiah comes he'll tell us these things can you imagine a woman trapped under bad character would we imagine character but she was the genuine bride she was the real article because the religious systems of the day had no power to give her a life that could overcome that life he didn't reveal himself to the priest he didn't declare who he was the last place the world thought messiah would come on in samaria to a woman of bad characters the new birth is a revelation of jesus christ to you said she was born right there he come to her personally i'm the messiah it was our religion she was going back to jacob's well and she was dipping water out of that old baptist well sipping water trying to get life she she didn't need a little water pot of oil of water the people she dropped her pot because that voice told her if you come to me and drink i'm the well [Applause] and she ran into the city and she began giving out water she didn't need the pot and there people said that she didn't need the church now she was a fountain [Applause] because he was a head and because he kept changing the commandment from a prophet and changing it to his own he gave them a king of their choice but now god said i'm going to choose my choice and it goes to the house of jesus and he's powerful he's and even samuel thinks this shirley must be him samuel and he goes with the crews of oil and god says no [Applause] back his own he's looking for a character i wanted a character to be king you want a mighty powerful man he didn't want a good looking man he wanted his king to have his character but when he gets the acts the phrase that will do all my will what is a man after god's own heart one that will do all his will why was jesus christ a perfect reflection of god only did what pleased the father and he only spoke what the father taught so when you get to the garden of gethsemane don't do don't get i guess money jesus is wrestling with his own will [Music] he's surrendering his own human will [Music] would you please let this cup pass god is there any other way you know god can there be another path and when god said no he said according to thy will he surrendered his will that was the character of christ now what kind of character will his bride we continue to serve our own purpose in this world [Applause] because that's the only character that he will join himself akiva that lives in you and manifest him on it's not worldly beauty of him an attractive bride it's his character and the character of the church that jesus looks for is to which the modern churches of today certainly miss his program they miss it a million miles because they deny this to be the truth so how could it be ellie whatever she is skilly he is they must be one he's waiting for this church to be formed this bride for me hebrews 13 8 and the manifestation of the son of man will be made so real that would unite the christ and bride again but why what is the ministry of the son of man supposed to do jesus christ but it was supposed to accomplish something there was a purpose behind it remember amos so god says i will do nothing unless i first reveal it to the servants the prophets so that means the prophets must forerun something god's doing it's not the completion of what he's doing it's forerunning what he's doing and brother branham was forerunning something he was forerunning the coming of christ so the son of man was revealed he said when the word here unites with the person and they too become one then what does it do then i pray it manifests the son of man again manifest [Applause] the church does the same thing so what was the revealing of the son of man it'll come down so powerful that'll unite the head and the body as one let's look at first corinthians together i don't know i'm going to ensemble we're going to end with this thought out of first corinthians 1 first corinthians chapter 11. i'm going to we understand this is the chapter the prophet or the paul talks about here but i want you to pay attention to what he says for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man [Music] the man is the glory of god love the jew christ was the glory of the father christ but the woman is the glory of the man what's the glory of christ where and the kind of woman he chooses and becomes his glory said in the message it is the rising of the sun he said people are trying to say wash feet once a year on thursday and on friday we should take communion all different doctrines they argue whether it should be this day or that day is but they have certainly carried out their traditions listen friends do me a favor don't put this out in denominations now don't put it in the denomination bring it right here in the mess bring it right to your own life to because you believe god sent a prophet believing god sent a prophet doesn't make you bride god choosing you and becoming one with you makes you proud if if he wasn't a sabbath only son of god brother branham was not a part-time son of god he wasn't a sunday and wednesday son of god but [Applause] [Applause] he wants a bride that's always a bride [Applause] [Applause] [Music] it didn't change when he was in the jungles in africa he had the same character the character of christ that's the only kind of bride he's uniting with in this day of the farmer this is not the day for part-time christians but god is looking for all the time that your private life is christian your work life is christian your school [Applause] amen and that's the kind of bride he's looking for jean one that will reflect his character no matter where you're at that's the bride of christ don't be deceived coming to that go read the token message he says you say i believe every word you preach brother he said that's not it yet he said you must take it you the message is is the life of jesus christ the message is not god sent a prophet that was the forerunner to the message the the message is a living episode you can't say i believe the message because i believe brother brennan was a prophet the message is the life of jesus christ in the formation of a bride in the end times [Music] anything [Applause] that's what he is and when i look around the message church what good is coming to church if you have no life coming the church is good but if you have no lives i here's what he said satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow there'll be no resurrection no matter how religious how many churches you belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again unless that token life is in you let's go down a little further in first corinthians 11. now we know that the glory of the man is the woman she's the reflection of the man so the glory of christ is his bride but what's the glory of the woman verse 15. but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering me unique her long hair is a glory unto her the woman is the glory of the man the family but what's the woman's glory her long hair because brother branham said hair to a woman is her nazarite vow and what is the nazarite vowel it's a vowel of consecration under a nazarite vowel the nazirite wouldn't cut his hair it wasn't the length of the hair it was that it was not cut and when he didn't cut his hair he showed that he was in the vow with god so what is what is the glory of the woman it's her long hair so what is the glory of the bride her consecration to god her glory is her nazarite vow the glory of the bride is her separation from everything of the world and all denominational ideas and she's consecrated only to one secret and that's the christ the word and that is the glory of the bride the bride is the glory of the man of christ this is the last scripture i want to read i told you genesis 24 was what brother branham started the message choosing of a bride and they're coming they're coming to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife we own this sit down brother venom started choosing of a bride with these two scriptures showing that he's a liaison and he's calling a bride but the bride has to be able to receive revelation from god and that there's going to be a revelation by one of the angels having one of the seven vials i wonder which angel would be the one to show us who's the brightest wife because that's what brother branham was doing in choosing of a bride he goes on here and says in verse 10. and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain showed me that great city in holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clears crystal sonita transparent and it goes on to describe it continue this pyramid city see this pyramid city and it's the description given here that's the seventh angel that one of the seven angels to learn to sit on the song now showing the bride but when john looked he saw a city because this pyramid-shaped city [Applause] christ himself and each individual stone is part of this city but the only way for the light to get out of the city from where through the city through the stones do not appear through your life you must be a pure stone to shine the light you mean so when the seventh angel allah that has one of the seven vials says i will show you the bride the lamb's wife he begins to show the city and he begins to preach future home because if you come down to verse 16 it says in the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth and the measure of the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal de la villavilla formed he measured the wall there of 144 cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel is and he tells us that this is 1200 cubits i'm sorry 12 000 furlongs for 16. 12 000 furlongs and the length and the breath and the height of it are equal and when brother branham comes to the scripture he begins to say it's not a and he's revealing to us the bride the lamb's wife and he's showing it in city form and he said there's another measurement where the length and the height and the breath are equal it's not a cube it's a pyramid and this pyramid is the new jerusalem and brother begins showing future homes angel have to give you the dimensions and he says it's fifteen hundred miles this way and he says an interesting statement he said that would be about from maine to florida and from the east coast to uh i think he said the uh someplace in canada past the mississippi river i think he says saskatchewan and he's looking at people in his congregation that have come from those areas [Music] and he says about what we have right here this morning because you've come from maine and from florida you from saskatchewan oh right here and brother branham was showing us that the present home is showing the future where god was living [Applause] and then the fire is going to fall to burn it off to make it a fit place for christ and his bride to live together and the whole time he's talking about the redemption of the earth and the blood was you were washed in the blood of jesus christ and then the fire of the holy ghost come and burnt you out making you a fit place for christ and his bride to live together in you are the one that's been adorned for christ you've been adorned under the ministry of haggai you've been perfumed by the anointing of the holy ghost [Applause] and now presented to christ and united with christ and now you're the reflection of his life because that's what the future holds it's going to be like brother branham comes to the middle part of choosing a bride at the beginning he talks about that earthquake would he said it could come this way if the lord ever tells me i'll reveal it to you then he comes to the middle of his message he starts talking about when he was on the mountain and the next day that thing came down and it blasted three times and cut the rocks out of the tree yeah and every rock was in a pyramid shape and then he said a couple days from that it went up to alaska and nearly sank alaska started that earthquake and then it's come down to washington and now at the end of choosing of a bride now remember there's two scriptures brother branham reads at the beginning are choosing a bride and the vile angel the judgment angel dude showing the pride the lamb's wife and he comes to the end of that message and god takes over his voice it says o capernaum capernaum thou city that exalted self above the angels thou shalt be brought down to hell and he prophesies of the destruction of los angeles and a huge earthquake that'll shake the earth what was he doing he was playing the role of the seventh angel you rejected every other woman and that rejection was signified by a prophet that was going to bring a destruction to the world [Applause] he doesn't choose and all that was not chosen to be bride was doomed to destruction choosing of a bride is wonderful if you're the bride that i can say by revelation i was no different than mary magdalene that had seven devils and christ come and said i'm the one who's speaking to you it's not the man i'm from kentucky it's not the man in jeffersonville it's not the tape it's not the book it's me i'm messiah that speak it to [Music] there's a character trapped down in your soul and he wants by the power of the holy ghost to unlock that character and that character is a reflection of his own character i say if that thing is welling up in you this morning if you're feeling it just go to your own garden at gassimini oh if you've had a hard time letting go of things of the earth if you've had a hard time to die this morning i invite you to the garden of gethsemane [Applause] to shine your light out of this stone from the city oh god let your character be on this one let's all stand our heads but god we know you're looking for a character they will give up their lives so that they can be a full-time bride so that they can reflect your character everywhere may and make us more like you day by day may we be your glory on this earth and may our glory be our nazarite in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you all it's been a pleasure to be with you may god bless [Music] well we appreciate the lord for sure and i'm sure if you were listening you were blessed i really believe that all [Music] should leave out here this morning changed in some way [Music] so we thank god for the word of god we appreciate everything that's been said and done and one thing for certain you can show something wrong if you really have a conscience you'll never forget this message and every time satan tried to make you act differently may this word rings through your soul because we must imagine like the chinese laundry ticket we [Music] that was torn from him and then reunited with him make sure you tell brother chad how much you appreciated the message and most of all thank god for his grace and mercy [Music] in moments like this [Music] i'll sing out [Music] [Music] in i sing out in moments in moments like these i [Music] [Music] i love [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i love [Music] you [Music] the beauty of
