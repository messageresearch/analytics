[4:47] the seventh verse for the mystery of
[4:51] iniquity doth already work only he who
[4:54] now letteth will let until he be taken
[4:57] out of the way and then shall the wicked
[5:01] be revealed from the Lord shall consume
[5:05] for the law whom the Lord shall consume
[5:07] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[5:10] destroy with the brightness of his
[5:13] coming for even him whose coming is
[5:17] after the work of Satan with all power
[5:19] and signs and lying wonders and with all
[5:23] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[5:25] them with that perish because they
[5:28] received not the love of the truth that
[5:30] they might be saved and for this cause
[5:35] God shall send them strong delusion that
[5:37] they should believe alive that they all

[6:20] outside God we surrender to you tonight
[6:23] have thine own way in Jesus Christ's
[6:27] name we pray we need your Lord amen you
[6:31] may be seated
[6:34] our prese Lord we still working with
[6:36] spirit and truth but I'd like to kind of
[6:42] encourage you tonight to keep on loving
[6:46] the truth as I said this morning how
[6:53] that God provided away one of the things
[6:59] because of time we left off on but God
[7:04] never leaves himself without a witness
[7:09] one of the young brothers that came this
[7:13] morning asked a question he says why do
[7:17] we have all these religions did God
[7:21] create create all that that was Jared I
[7:25] thought oh that's good yeah I said no
[7:29] sir I said all of these things that we
[7:32] see now is has been placed there to
[7:36] brought the truth I said all of these
[7:40] religions and things that we are now
[7:42] seeing is caused by the devil people who
[7:45] are religious and while the young lady
[7:49] was there I said even science has become
[7:53] a religion and people are believing more
[7:57] in science than they do the Word of God
[8:01] they would rather believe that some
[8:04] alien came from another world and built
[8:06] the pyramids forgive you for laughing
[8:10] when I told him I said all of the truth
[8:12] that we need is right in the Bible so
[8:16] we've got a Bible study coming up
[8:18] I've been working on him by God's grace
[8:20] he said brother Brooks every time I hear
[8:23] you preach I get goosebumps I said
[8:24] that's the Holy Spirit and you see we
[8:29] realized that God is doing a great work
[8:32] somebody in all of this chaos still was
[8:36] true and yet we find those of us who
[8:40] have the truth treated as if it's
[8:44] nothing
[8:46] it would have been better if we'd had
[8:49] never heard this message then they hear
[8:52] this message and turn from it it would
[8:57] have been better if we remain a
[8:58] Pentecostal or Baptist then to come amen
[9:02] to this message and deny it you and I
[9:09] must realize amen that the truth will
[9:12] always remain the truth people said well
[9:16] the truth shall set you free no the
[9:19] truth shall make you free when we talk
[9:23] about truth we said like this morning
[9:26] there's only one way to worship God
[9:29] that's in spirit and in truth there's a
[9:34] time God the Bible said winked and our
[9:37] ignorance and God doesn't weak anymore
[9:40] because God has come at a time where he
[9:43] has unveiled himself in me and we saw we
[9:49] know now that when we guest in in all of
[9:53] the ages and we hoped in all of the ages
[9:57] that you know oh I hope I'm saved and I
[9:59] hope I make it and you know I hope I'm
[10:02] worshiping God right God has answered
[10:05] all of those questions he has given us a
[10:08] very remedy for everything that we need
[10:11] to make it but the Bible said broad is
[10:14] the way that leadeth to destruction and
[10:16] Strout Strait and narrow is the way that
[10:18] leadeth to eternal life and the Bible
[10:20] said only a few beads that find it so
[10:24] you got to understand that even amongst
[10:26] the message people who we are identify
[10:29] myself with Malachi 4 revelation
[10:32] seven and Luke you know we we we know
[10:35] 1730 we understand Amen that God and
[10:38] then sent a prophet and enough but but
[10:41] that's that's that's not enough and when
[10:45] I explained this to you I want you to
[10:46] understand brother Branham a man when he
[10:49] came he came to bring us truth he came
[10:53] to bring us their entrance or the way or
[10:56] to make it clear to us how to make a
[10:59] rapture is that right his ministry was
[11:02] to open up to our understanding or to
[11:06] enlighten us even how to make a rapture
[11:10] I was listening to questioning the
[11:12] answers and how he said how that when
[11:14] God got ready to he likin it our
[11:18] election as a woman who lays a pattern
[11:22] out on the floor and she's going to make
[11:24] a garment and how she takes that
[11:26] material she lays it out and then she
[11:29] cuts what material she wants to make the
[11:33] garment
[11:33] now the remnant of the material is just
[11:36] as good as a piece that he chose to make
[11:40] the garment but he says Amen that
[11:43] remnant was was our extra it was that
[11:46] material that he we call foolish virgins
[11:49] they made out of the same material but
[11:53] God has chosen them not to be bribed he
[11:58] said every Christian amen because you
[12:01] are Christian doesn't mean you're going
[12:03] to make the rapture hallelujah only
[12:06] those who have been elected and chosen
[12:09] from God will make a rapture is that
[12:13] truth so we don't have to wonder about
[12:16] whether we make a rapture amen I read
[12:20] the rapture in itself is a revelation
[12:23] personally to that individual you say
[12:27] what do you mean brother Brooks when
[12:29] that Rancher son came to that young lady
[12:32] who was in the backyard he meant
[12:35] throwing out the dishwater when nobody
[12:37] else knew who he was are real recognized
[12:40] for this way when he never approached
[12:43] anyone else
[12:44] to talk to her in the way that he talked
[12:47] to the lady young girl in in the
[12:49] backyard that girl had a personal
[12:52] revelation of the rancher son those
[12:57] girls in the any other other room
[12:59] dancing having a good time shouting
[13:02] speaking in tongues whatever they were
[13:03] doing they did not have that revelation
[13:06] that the rancher son was interested in
[13:09] them but this young lady not only knew
[13:13] but she talked with him he invited her
[13:16] or it gave her amen
[13:19] ah invitation to become his bride is
[13:23] that right it was a personal thing even
[13:26] though she was among all of the others
[13:28] she knew that that was a revelation and
[13:31] God had given her that revelation of who
[13:34] she was I meant no matter what the other
[13:38] girls said to her how they laughed at
[13:41] her
[13:41] how they are made mockery of her she
[13:45] knew the truth she understood that the
[13:49] rancher son will soon be my husband
[13:52] amen so when we look at this thing we
[13:56] must understand that this message is not
[13:59] religion this message a man is not a man
[14:04] for us to uplift
[14:06] uh-uh-uh-uh-uh how could I said put
[14:09] anything I'll put it in this message
[14:11] doesn't just belong to this church even
[14:16] though we are symbol here amen under the
[14:18] UH nun brother
[14:19] of the word of God for this day it it
[14:22] doesn't belong just to this church
[14:24] because there are many people in this
[14:27] church it meant that here the preaching
[14:29] every week and still haven't budged in
[14:32] their daily lives what is the issue
[14:35] because somewhere in their lives
[14:38] amen they haven't got a revelation of
[14:41] who they are and what they mean to God
[14:45] because when you realize that you are
[14:48] the Bride of Christ just like that young
[14:50] lady she began to make herself ready is
[14:55] that the problems well
[14:56] and then so when God that is truth and
[15:00] the truth make you free
[15:02] she she she didn't have no glorious
[15:05] clothes she had nothing that was
[15:07] different about what who she was she had
[15:10] one thing that the other girls didn't
[15:12] have and that was a promise hallelujah
[15:15] and when this message become a promise
[15:18] to you it transforms you I didn't say a
[15:22] hope I didn't say a hope it becomes a
[15:26] promise and God can never break his
[15:29] promise Oh hallelujah
[15:33] we know that the mystery of iniquity I
[15:35] was telling the church I said if they
[15:38] had only been down there Friday night
[15:40] for a brother D oka
[15:41] it would have transformed it would have
[15:43] done something if you left out of there
[15:45] and and left out of there the same way
[15:47] you came something's wrong amen
[15:50] what a masterpiece what a what and I
[15:53] would encourage you a man to go go line
[15:55] and take us on Facebook or whatever I
[15:58] don't know how you get to it but one of
[16:00] these brothers no but my point is you
[16:03] know he is he's preaching in English so
[16:06] those of us who are english-speaking you
[16:08] can understand but anyway it's really
[16:11] really really good lord I've never seen
[16:17] I've seen a lot of things but there was
[16:19] not one stone uncovered in other words
[16:23] there was no one in service that left
[16:25] out and say well you know he didn't get
[16:27] me everybody got licks
[16:36] it was just that good I love Corrections
[16:39] I love services with correction now
[16:41] even so you know even though correction
[16:44] like I said it ain't good for the flesh
[16:46] no flesh love it but what it what it
[16:48] what it produces after the correction is
[16:52] that right so I'm saying the truth
[16:54] that's what I heard I heard truth
[16:57] I heard truth in a way Amen that that it
[17:01] was so simple yet so powerful and he
[17:05] talking about victories victories in our
[17:08] lives is that right
[17:10] you and I know and I even took a quote
[17:13] from what he said what he was talking
[17:15] about a preaching on and I incorporated
[17:16] in my message today so you gotta
[17:19] understand here we're working with true
[17:21] we are the light of the world he meant
[17:25] about said we are a city that says on a
[17:27] hill that cannot be here oh my god and
[17:33] we cannot be a light amen and reflect
[17:37] anything outside of what he is because
[17:41] God is the light remember I got a quote
[17:43] here my brother Greg where brother I'm
[17:45] say you and I we reflect wherever our
[17:49] souls are wherever our spirit is
[17:52] whatever we're doing in the unseen it
[17:54] will reflect in the scene is that all
[17:59] right there i'ma use this quote quickly
[18:03] because you know the Lord quicken it to
[18:05] me he said we find a few years ago that
[18:09] all the modern dressings for the people
[18:11] that it all comes from perish which is
[18:15] which is a seed of Satan but now we find
[18:18] that we have come so polluted and so far
[18:21] more advanced in sin and to perish and
[18:24] French designers are coming to Hollywood
[18:27] to find how to dress the people in
[18:30] France he said what a disgrace devil
[18:34] took it from the picture show and put it
[18:36] right in your home uncensored programs
[18:40] on television all kinds of worldliness
[18:42] ISM and weak pulpits and pastors
[18:45] compromising with things of the world
[18:47] loving their position and a meal ticket
[18:50] more than they would to stand and tell
[18:53] the truth about God's Word and in that
[18:55] it brought the church into a chaos and
[18:58] it separated us and divided us and so
[19:02] much world that you Holly knows one from
[19:05] the other and our sermons are no more
[19:08] based upon the world unusually in a pool
[19:11] or modern pulpit it's about who's the
[19:14] next president of some lovely rose us
[19:17] roses or somewhere or some program that
[19:19] the church out early so that they can go
[19:22] see a certain program
[19:23] preached over 20 minutes and their
[19:26] excommunicate you now I know that's true
[19:29] cuz I was in an Apostolic Church and
[19:31] when they're what they call it now the
[19:33] seasonal football games came in on what
[19:35] they do it on Sundays now and you know
[19:37] they would let the church out early and
[19:40] sometimes some of the preachers wouldn't
[19:42] even come to church because they had to
[19:44] see the Superbowl that's it God have
[19:48] mercy on the people God the Superbowl
[19:51] and people would literally uh they might
[20:00] as well be out there under the
[20:02] television said watching the Superbowl
[20:03] Kerr their mind wasn't here in the
[20:05] preacher I could almost hear him hurry
[20:07] up preacher I mean the Superbowl gonna
[20:10] be on in about five minutes but that's
[20:13] the way people are and that's the way
[20:16] they do is that right now we look at
[20:20] people and I'm gonna tell you something
[20:21] my son said the other day somebody said
[20:25] oh he wears a cross and said oh you
[20:27] brave wearing that cross and I thought
[20:30] to myself but that cross it's just a
[20:34] symbol that cross don't mean nothing if
[20:38] you are not converted that cross means
[20:41] nothing hallelujah think about it I mean
[20:46] you think about all the symbolism that
[20:48] we simple things that we use is it meant
[20:51] to say we're in the message all those
[20:53] symbols only nothing
[20:57] hello-hello the Catholic Church got
[20:59] crosses hallelujah they got all kind of
[21:02] idols and everything before them but
[21:05] inside of all of that what are they yeah
[21:09] he what I'm saying you know a lot of
[21:11] times you know I remember one time my
[21:13] brother came into my church when I live
[21:15] in we lived in South Carolina
[21:16] it wasn't my church I went in the past
[21:18] at the time but he said to me when he
[21:22] after the service he said this doesn't
[21:24] look like a message Church I never
[21:27] forget over there the Holy Ghost struck
[21:28] me what what does the message Church
[21:32] look like please
[21:35] what a message church looks like like
[21:36] you right brother like you like you like
[21:45] you like that's what a message church is
[21:47] I miss church is not a building
[21:51] hallelujah
[21:52] oh who can who can be more religious
[21:55] than Israel and what's with Israel is
[22:00] dead you understand what I mean by that
[22:03] until Jesus Christ come in their lives
[22:06] they are just living legalistic Lee and
[22:12] and they're performing structurally
[22:16] until the Holy Ghost comes the truth of
[22:22] this message is not how much you got
[22:24] along you can wear your dresses or your
[22:27] hair the truth of this message gets the
[22:30] life that you live hallelujah cuz we see
[22:35] right now that there are people even in
[22:37] the message Amen they might wear long
[22:39] but they're so tight come on somebody
[22:44] but that's not truth it looks like it
[22:49] but it's not see you got to understand
[22:53] what truth is this is what I said this
[22:55] morning God weakened this thing to me
[22:58] let that will be done in earth as it is
[23:02] in heaven you're not going to find in
[23:05] heaven sexy
[23:07] holiness everything will be holy
[23:14] hallelujah and we find out they meant
[23:18] that that's what the inner the devil is
[23:19] saying wear your long dresses but where
[23:22] I'm so tight that every curve is seen
[23:27] hallelujah you can't do that and expect
[23:31] God to accept it that's not truth the
[23:35] brother brother once said every woman up
[23:37] there had on comments that were flowing
[23:40] see if the Holy Ghost got them looking
[23:43] and dressing like that up there he
[23:45] expect the Holy Ghost make us look
[23:48] and dress the same way there's no flash
[23:53] of skin revealing we sisters we hit that
[24:00] because brother em say that's how you
[24:01] can tell the condition of the church by
[24:03] the way the sisters dress see so I'm
[24:09] just saying that brothers two brothers
[24:10] have their ways you know but my point is
[24:14] the only thing that is going to change
[24:16] us listen John 4:17 says even the Spirit
[24:20] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[24:22] because it seeth him not neither knows
[24:26] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[24:29] with you and shall be in you my question
[24:32] this morning was who which of us know
[24:35] him
[24:36] which of you which of us see him I see
[24:40] him every day I see him my brothers I
[24:44] see him in my sisters I see him in me he
[24:49] awaits me every morning he causes me to
[24:52] pray I see him every day when he opens
[24:57] the word hello and it's true and then
[25:02] just like the brothers say this is the
[25:04] truth if you truly got Christ on me
[25:06] inside then Christ fees off of his word
[25:10] I heard what the Prophet God says when
[25:13] the Holy Ghost comes he comes to
[25:15] recharge you I like that word recharged
[25:18] to charge you up he said like a battery
[25:21] who is that okay so we look at this
[25:27] thing and I still I'm still looking and
[25:29] under trying to understand what a
[25:30] message church means people put pressure
[25:36] on people because because our church is
[25:39] not it's not set up like their church
[25:40] and then brother man said we're not an
[25:43] organization we're not a denomination
[25:46] you know and God taught me that you know
[25:49] when I was in the system when I was in
[25:51] an organization God took me there was a
[25:53] but the church I was firm is what it was
[25:56] called progressive Church of our Lord
[25:57] Jesus Christ but when they became
[25:59] incorporated it was progressive Church
[26:01] of our Lord
[26:02] and Savior Jesus Christ incorporated and
[26:04] that incorporation and I looked at that
[26:07] thing I said oh my god what is this
[26:09] because he had added something and God
[26:11] says his church is not like McDonald's
[26:13] or Burger King that was God's Way of
[26:15] explaining to me I didn't know the
[26:17] message at the time but I knew that that
[26:19] moved that they made was wrong you
[26:21] understand me I knew that wasn't of God
[26:24] but then you come into the message
[26:26] churches we come into the message and
[26:27] you know we find the same thing that
[26:30] people would put pressure on you they
[26:32] look around to see if the clouds name
[26:34] they look around to see if brother
[26:36] Branham pitches name y'all understand me
[26:38] they look young y'all better understand
[26:40] what I'm saying because we it's a thin
[26:43] line you're not gonna understand what
[26:44] I'm sayin if you don't have the Holy
[26:45] Ghost
[26:46] you don't think I'm almost talking
[26:48] against the message which I'm not the
[26:49] message is Jesus Christ y'all understand
[26:52] me but I'm trying to say there's nothing
[26:54] wrong I love the picture brother ennum
[26:56] with the filler fire I love the cloud
[26:58] hallelujah but don't force me see oh
[27:04] that after a while you know people think
[27:06] well if I don't have a belt buckle and a
[27:09] cowboy hat and some cowboy boots cuz
[27:12] don't you dawg that's a cult around the
[27:14] message when you go to their church you
[27:16] got to have some cowboy boots and some
[27:18] bumbles and everything else you got to
[27:20] look like William Branham I'm sayin
[27:26] see what I'm trying to say people that's
[27:28] not where you emphasize it now you see
[27:32] what I'm saying we need a double portion
[27:35] of the spirit of Elijah and he lied you
[27:43] said unto Elijah if you see me go if you
[27:50] see me go and there's a lot of people
[27:53] who have not seen the Prophet go how
[27:57] many times I listen to tapes every day
[27:59] there's not a week that goes by I don't
[28:03] hear a message or two maybe it's three
[28:04] if it all depends on the length of it
[28:06] God is my witness I always listen my
[28:09] wife will tell you in the morning when I
[28:11] wake up boom when I'm in the restroom
[28:13] it's I'm listening
[28:15] you understand
[28:16] me why because there's something on the
[28:18] inside feeding it feeding off of it
[28:22] hallelujah and I look at this thing and
[28:24] I said Lord I said what is wrong I am my
[28:27] my whole desire is to look like him to
[28:31] walk like him to act like him to be like
[28:34] him
[28:34] hallelujah I don't need to be a replica
[28:40] my image is the Christ your image is
[28:45] supposed to be the Christ nobody else
[28:49] you understand me and I hear and I think
[28:53] what is truth
[28:55] jesus said except you believe that I am
[28:58] he you should likewise die in your sins
[29:04] is that the truth you got to know you
[29:08] say well well you know uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
[29:11] God was in brother Branham anybody can
[29:14] deny that if you do you probably got big
[29:18] problems
[29:20] hallelujah and we know like they said
[29:23] like that couldn t you say Nicodemus
[29:26] said well we know no man can do these
[29:29] things when brother Branham was on the
[29:32] scene there was no man no man could have
[29:34] done what he did in fact he said if I
[29:36] had the powder here I would heal you but
[29:39] I must wait on him he was here declaring
[29:43] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[29:45] today and forever
[29:48] that is what truth is hallelujah and you
[29:54] and I must realized by the grace of God
[29:56] we are missed Jesus Christ hello
[30:01] we're not miss Ella le either
[30:06] we'll miss Jesus Christ we're not mrs.
[30:09] John we are miss Jesus Christ and we
[30:14] must bear the image in the name of our
[30:17] Lord and Savior I was there 54 said that
[30:21] he our Redeemer has also become our
[30:23] husband he is my husband right
[30:28] now I say these things not to not to
[30:31] deter or to change anything my thoughts
[30:34] is listen if we're going to worship in
[30:37] spirit you can't have truth and then not
[30:40] have the spirit because the equation is
[30:42] spirit and truth hallelujah you can't
[30:46] you can't say where I got the spirit and
[30:48] you don't have true because realize what
[30:51] we got and I've got I've seen people
[30:53] right now great men of God
[30:55] it meant who's got thousands of people
[30:57] in supposedly in this message now they
[31:02] are eight angels they have become the
[31:05] eighth angel they have become the
[31:07] message of the hour nonsense the
[31:12] greatest ministry that ever hit the
[31:14] earth was the ministry of Malachi for
[31:17] since since Jesus Christ y'all hear me
[31:24] and when brother Branham left off the
[31:27] scene he didn't leave us in a simpie
[31:29] space he introduced Jesus Christ himself
[31:36] am I making sense so my thing is this if
[31:40] we go to worship Him let us worship Him
[31:43] in truth understand for the truth of God
[31:46] so that when when we when when that time
[31:49] come we'll have no spot no blemish no
[31:52] wrinkle no nothing our love for God
[31:55] would be virtuous who think about it we
[32:05] looking at then when I say this let me
[32:07] get back to that thought there are so
[32:09] many people and that's why I say the
[32:11] mystery of iniquity does already work do
[32:14] you really think that God left this
[32:16] message to itself or the devil would
[32:19] leave this message to itself when he has
[32:22] already feel traded all of the
[32:25] denominations and he turned them against
[32:28] each other is that right
[32:29] I mean the so-called angel light is what
[32:32] the devil did he got into preachers who
[32:35] are not even the seed of God and they
[32:38] perverted the gospel is that the work
[32:39] that's where Jew said they were all day
[32:42] for that purpose so you got preachers or
[32:47] we look at denominations we can see that
[32:49] but we got preachers in the message that
[32:52] has been ordained to provide it that's
[32:59] why you got to read it you got to study
[33:01] it amen you can't leave this out either
[33:04] the Bible and those message books goes
[33:08] together like this New Testament it's a
[33:13] revelation of the Old Testament and the
[33:15] brother Brown of the booster spoken Lord
[33:17] wishes the revelation of the New
[33:19] Testament but it's not one against the
[33:22] other they all come together and you
[33:26] can't make a rapture without the
[33:28] revelation of the New Testament is that
[33:34] the truth I don't mean no harm
[33:39] I'm telling you the truth and because
[33:42] you're born again that's the thing I
[33:44] believe every one of us born again
[33:45] because something brought you here you
[33:47] said well I'm not perfect neither am i
[33:49] but when you're born again which when
[33:52] you accept the Lord Jesus Christ into
[33:53] your heart and you really believe it
[33:56] that's your conception God comes down
[33:59] and you justify not right amen but
[34:02] that's not all it you move on up to
[34:04] sanctification that same confession we
[34:06] start telling you take this off put this
[34:09] on take this off put this on don't look
[34:11] at this don't look at that you know it
[34:13] begins to sanctify you and it doesn't
[34:16] happen in a day hallelujah that's for
[34:21] true when sanctification was good enough
[34:23] it's not good enough anywhere no more
[34:25] you need the Holy Ghost you need to come
[34:29] to a place in your life where you say
[34:30] Lord not my will but thine be done when
[34:34] you get there God can work with you
[34:37] hallelujah
[34:39] and when you live righteousness the
[34:41] Bible tells us amen to live golly you
[34:45] will suffer persecution is that right
[34:47] let me tell you something even in this
[34:49] message if you put your mind and your
[34:51] heart to serve in the Lord with all of
[34:53] your heart even your same brothers
[34:55] your sisters would persecute you for
[34:58] being righteous and holy Oh daddy all
[35:02] that ain't necessary oh my that brother
[35:05] do Chi I tell you what I don't never get
[35:08] the urge to give a man a holy kiss but
[35:10] that day I did I wanted to kiss him on
[35:12] the jaw and I don't want him to punch me
[35:15] either but I felt so good coz he hit all
[35:21] those areas I had been thinking in my
[35:23] mind my we were talking about it going
[35:25] down as brother Frank some of the things
[35:27] that he was saying we were talking about
[35:29] going down there to Iowa City and I was
[35:32] thinking also you know people think you
[35:36] know they they they think pastors are
[35:37] stupid you know and I put this way how
[35:40] can I say it God tells us things and and
[35:42] there are things that we can't even say
[35:44] you know he hit on brothers drinking he
[35:47] hit on brothers looking at bad stuff
[35:49] hello
[35:50] he hit on all kinds of undercover sins
[35:54] and I knew they were there no you know
[35:59] but I can't say things are that I'm
[36:00] saying god I can't say things until you
[36:03] tell me to say things and after all my
[36:05] god this is God speaking because we look
[36:10] listen God had just said to me Ezekiel I
[36:13] want you to look through the wall I want
[36:18] to told you to see what Israel doing you
[36:20] know when God talks to a preacher like
[36:22] that he knows it's the nasty stuff going
[36:25] on I want you to look through the wall I
[36:28] want you to see what's going on among
[36:30] Israel not only they doing wicked stuff
[36:34] but they are all in a Dollar Tree
[36:37] hallelujah they're dancing to bail see
[36:42] if you're not dancing in the spirit
[36:43] you're dancing to bail that's all I'm
[36:49] telling you bill is the choreographer he
[36:52] choreograph things but when it comes to
[36:54] God when you dancing the spirit you
[36:56] don't know which way you're gonna move
[36:58] there y'all getting quiet on me now but
[37:01] it's okay we're gonna live and we're
[37:03] gonna worship God in spirit
[37:06] and in truth and you must be determined
[37:09] Amen if I am the only one he knock had a
[37:14] attitude about his holiness in his wake
[37:18] walkway of walk he had an attitude if
[37:21] I'm gonna be the only one did you know
[37:23] that brother Branham said that he not
[37:25] one day said goodbye to his wife and
[37:27] family and walked on with God so if I
[37:29] had a family in which we didn't even
[37:31] know but he was determined he would go
[37:36] stay in that spirit and that truth
[37:38] brother man said I'm so happy that God
[37:42] amen to know that Jesus will never
[37:44] forsake us is that right I'm so happy
[37:50] it meant coming out of to see Jesus I am
[37:52] so happy that Jesus will not forsake me
[37:57] is that right
[37:59] you know I look at people and sometimes
[38:02] I look at the scriptures and I think
[38:04] okay you had the you had rehabing in
[38:08] Jericho you had the woman at the well
[38:10] you had Mary who had all those demons
[38:13] and all and you know and even even Jesus
[38:17] is up disciples all had issues so God
[38:20] didn't come for sanctified people or
[38:22] people who already think the fact he
[38:24] came to get people who were a mess
[38:26] their life was a mess hallelujah that's
[38:30] where God is glorified is that right he
[38:33] he didn't just start the world and then
[38:35] he could have fashioned the world and
[38:37] everything else and it could have been
[38:38] perfect order but he wait to the world
[38:40] was a mess it was chaotic and then God
[38:43] said let there be hallelujah and every
[38:47] one of us has a testimony and like I
[38:51] tell people I don't care
[38:52] listen you can say I had this demon with
[38:56] me a long time as far as I know of this
[38:58] thing to torment me all my life well
[38:59] there was a man who was born blind lived
[39:03] it thirty years did that mean because
[39:06] you were born blind you don't if there's
[39:08] no possibility for you to see absolutely
[39:12] not
[39:13] you and I have been ordained to be sons
[39:16] and daughters of God y'all understand me
[39:20] but you gotta believe that God is able
[39:23] you can't believe that a devil is more
[39:25] powerful than God
[39:29] you gotta believe that God is God that's
[39:32] what he said he that cometh believed to
[39:34] me must believe that God is God and that
[39:37] he is a rewarder of bills that
[39:40] diligently seek Him
[39:41] people I don't care how messed up you
[39:44] are physically or spiritually my God is
[39:47] able B contains you please don't ever
[39:52] give up on God hallelujah
[39:56] don't give up on him if God can change
[40:01] the world he can change you and he put
[40:04] all those examples in there how many of
[40:06] us it was like Lazarus who was dead for
[40:09] days rotting with the maggots and
[40:11] everything else and God changed and we
[40:15] still live don't ever think don't let
[40:18] the devil make you confused in your mind
[40:21] that that God is not able to change me
[40:24] I've been like this so long that though
[40:26] it makes no difference with God he chose
[40:29] you while you were this way you
[40:32] understand me that means he can
[40:34] transform your ways he can do it if you
[40:38] let him it doesn't mean it's gonna be
[40:41] easy but you've got to surrender to it
[40:44] and like I said don't dress cold Joe
[40:47] don't don't dress those sins up when you
[40:50] get on your knees if you want all of
[40:51] those when you get on your knees you
[40:53] know don't don't say with Lord forgive
[40:56] me for my known sins in my unknown sins
[41:00] if you got a spirit and lust if you got
[41:03] a spear with fornication it doesn't
[41:05] matter what the Spirit is anything
[41:07] outside the Holy Ghost is perverted
[41:11] you're not the only one that has dealt
[41:13] with perversion no see y'all don't think
[41:17] I was born perverted everyone in of us
[41:21] in here was born perverted that's why
[41:24] you got to be born again hallelujah
[41:27] people are so afraid well I don't want
[41:30] nobody to know what different does it
[41:32] mean
[41:34] I don't care if I was blind and now I
[41:36] see what difference does it make who's
[41:40] gonna judge you according to Isaiah 54
[41:44] says nobody gonna judge me at the end of
[41:47] the day I'll be the judge who's gonna
[41:51] run the castle a world look at this is
[41:54] what this is what used to getting it
[41:55] next to me when I was in the nomination
[41:57] how people used to say well you know she
[42:00] used to be or he used to be don't be
[42:02] with that person because he used to be
[42:04] oh I used to get so angry brother I said
[42:07] well then does the blood of Jesus Christ
[42:09] have any power over here I don't care
[42:13] what a person used to be you understand
[42:16] me
[42:17] you should always living in sodomy
[42:19] tomorrow I don't care of a man coming
[42:21] here with a dress on if he comes in here
[42:24] with a dress on and he want to be
[42:26] changed he is welcome me women come in
[42:31] with pants on but they come to be
[42:33] changed that's what this is all about if
[42:36] we're not gonna be the hospital for the
[42:38] world we are we not the answer to the
[42:42] devil's questions we are the security we
[42:45] have the salt we are the hospital we are
[42:47] the rescue that's what truly is we have
[42:54] to be the ones to say praise God I know
[42:55] God can deliver coz I used to be
[43:00] Alleluia you know my thing is you know
[43:15] they ask Jesus Christ about prayer
[43:18] how should I pray I love this
[43:25] let thy will be done in earth as it is
[43:27] in heaven I love that Jesus is the
[43:30] spirit of prophecy you know what we've
[43:32] known we knew nothing about a bride
[43:34] before God sent Malachi for anybody you
[43:37] knew I didn't know you know for serious
[43:40] seriously when I was in the world as
[43:42] well as the church I always would hope
[43:44] that God was saved me you know I figure
[43:46] oh my God if I get
[43:48] caught doing something wrong and I died
[43:49] then I'm going to err that's not true
[43:53] see that's not truth yeah you know you
[43:58] look at you look at you look at a job's
[44:00] children they were caught partying
[44:02] according to brother branham they were
[44:04] not they were only under the blood
[44:06] because Joel made the sacrifice but he
[44:10] was worldly children and because they
[44:12] had a father who kept the token applied
[44:15] they ended up with salvation hallelujah
[44:20] brother brother tell us about this man
[44:22] this preacher who back slid he back slid
[44:26] and he tells us Amen how he's brother
[44:29] band he was a mechanic brother man who
[44:30] went to see him because he heard that
[44:32] the man had Baxter he said no I'm not
[44:34] going to serve the Lord any more he said
[44:36] you gotta be kidding no I'm not I'm
[44:39] serious and shortly the man died I don't
[44:43] know of alcoholism or whatever the case
[44:45] may be and brother branham said that man
[44:47] was saved say God couldn't get him into
[44:50] her pin and just like any parent he
[44:53] spanked him and put him to sleep
[44:55] brother mighty god you sir that's that's
[45:01] real grace that's what truth is it's
[45:04] based upon election God then chose you
[45:07] egg let me say like this so you can
[45:09] understand the Bible says blessed is the
[45:12] man that hears the sayings of this book
[45:14] now have you heard that means you
[45:18] blessed that means the devil can't curse
[45:20] you is that right blessed is the man not
[45:23] only that here's an read of it but he
[45:26] said blessed is a man why I love it
[45:28] because he said here at the reading
[45:29] because you know some of us don't like
[45:31] to read but we ain't it raised the Lord
[45:35] Amen so God covers the reader and the
[45:38] hero you're blessed this is truth I give
[45:44] my life for this message I don't care
[45:48] what people say about me I know my heart
[45:52] and you're not gonna have
[45:54] we become systemized because I realized
[45:59] there's a certain way you got to preach
[46:01] in this message and I refuse to preach
[46:03] it that way you say what what do you
[46:08] mean there's a system have you ever
[46:11] heard of wrap this preacher preach all
[46:12] Baptist preachers preach the same way
[46:14] and Joba went down into the you know
[46:26] they have a system of preaching the
[46:30] Apostolic to you know they are a little
[46:35] higher up hallelujah oh yeah let us
[46:42] kneel but you see they all have a system
[46:47] and the message have developed a system
[46:50] you don't see it but I came because I'm
[46:52] a preacher and if you don't say it just
[46:55] right way and if you don't you know you
[46:59] use two minutes scriptures you're not in
[47:01] the message and if you're not holding a
[47:06] message book you're not in the message
[47:08] who's gonna tell me I'm not in the
[47:10] message it's not only that the message
[47:15] is in me so what good look at all the
[47:18] preachers
[47:19] good friends of mine I've already cried
[47:21] and who are now could take this message
[47:25] and the quotes of this message and tie a
[47:29] circle a ring around me make me look
[47:31] stupid and now they're denying it and
[47:35] those same preachers I used to we used
[47:38] to clash about the Holy Ghost they
[47:42] wanted the Holy Ghost to be intellectual
[47:44] I said ah the Holy Ghost is an
[47:47] experience say what you want to say but
[47:52] I've never had a desire to leave this
[47:54] message hallelujah
[47:57] they're had these people over here I'm
[47:59] talking about what we call truth wanted
[48:01] me to run to this truth and run to this
[48:02] truth this great man that great man
[48:04] there is no great man
[48:06] the only great man is Jesus Christ oh my
[48:12] prophet pointed me to Jesus Christ and
[48:15] that's not even brother Branham out
[48:18] you can't leave brother Branham out no
[48:21] more than you can leave out Noah and
[48:23] Moses but my point is Amen when it comes
[48:26] to worship my worship only is to my
[48:29] husband and I don't know why I'm going
[48:33] there but that's where I am you know I
[48:36] just try to tell people I'm seeing
[48:38] things enough you know I know it's fine
[48:40] it's just really thin it's a thin very
[48:43] thin line and what I'm saying because
[48:46] I've seen people who rejoice and scream
[48:49] and holler when people say things and
[48:51] they're not catching it they're not
[48:53] catching it they're not catching it
[48:56] because it's so fine you know like
[49:00] brother Branham said when that man said
[49:01] oh you saying you God and brother
[49:03] Branham said how'd he said it but
[49:07] basically he's saying yeah well he's not
[49:09] far off from the truth right because
[49:14] there were times when brother Branham
[49:15] was preaching it was absolutely God you
[49:19] and I cannot deny it he didn't deny it
[49:22] he said there were times I had to go
[49:25] back to my recording and listen to what
[49:29] he said he said you know he used my
[49:33] voice he used my lips youngness Tammy so
[49:37] when I listened to the tape I'm not
[49:39] listening to the tape of a man I'm
[49:41] trying to hear the voice in the voice
[49:45] hallelujah and that voice in the voice
[49:48] it's a one there's a time I was going
[49:51] through my change in life you know and
[49:53] and and I was just it was really bad and
[49:56] and and and and one day I had already
[49:58] said to myself Lord and I don't mean
[50:00] this to be so long I'm sorry I said Lord
[50:02] I said I'm I said Lord I said you know
[50:07] am I gonna make it because everybody go
[50:10] through their change in life in a
[50:12] different way but it was terrible mine
[50:14] was and if I didn't have friends who who
[50:17] would stand there and listen to my
[50:20] whining and complaining I don't know
[50:21] where I'd be today but I had some
[50:23] genuine friends in this message and one
[50:26] day I said to the Lord they didn't know
[50:28] all that was going on in my life but I
[50:30] said Lord am I going to make it am I
[50:32] going to make it Lord and then the Holy
[50:36] Spirit told me to fight I found a
[50:38] message and I clicked it on I clicked it
[50:46] on and it was a prayer line and and the
[50:53] prayer line was going on and and and
[50:55] brother branham's said to this woman he
[50:58] says you going through your menopause
[51:00] and you said to God am I going to make
[51:03] it he said thus said the Lord you're
[51:10] going to make it when he said that God
[51:14] is my witness something left me because
[51:17] brother Ben who talks about men when
[51:19] they going through their menopause or
[51:20] their change in life he said that's when
[51:22] a demon gets into it can get into it and
[51:25] God delivered me now I'm just telling
[51:29] you now see that wasn't the man William
[51:33] Branham that was a voice you love the
[51:39] Lord
[51:40] Seifer for none of us liveth to himself
[51:43] and no man dieth to himself for whether
[51:48] we live we live unto the Lord and
[51:51] whether we die we die unto the Lord and
[51:54] whether we live therefore or die we are
[51:57] of the Lord's for to this in Christ both
[52:01] died and rose and revived that we might
[52:04] be that he might be the Lord both of the
[52:08] Dead and the living is that understood
[52:12] so he's Lord of lords if in anybody
[52:17] agree with me on that he is the lord of
[52:19] lords the holy spirit that's in me is in
[52:22] everyone that really believed us he's in
[52:25] there cuz you know what it's a
[52:27] revelation
[52:28] hey oh I feel it I've been feeling it
[52:32] for a long time but that doesn't mean
[52:34] he's in you hallelujah
[52:37] y'all remember the time y'all boys I
[52:39] don't know whether y'all used to do this
[52:40] or not but we used to have rain it would
[52:42] rain and we play in that rain and get
[52:45] all wet but all of a sudden we wanted to
[52:47] taste it brother
[52:48] you don't taste the rain by keeping your
[52:50] mouth shut you hold your head up every
[52:53] child I know y'all I got some
[52:56] inspiration that children do let me see
[52:58] what it tastes like
[52:59] right and that's when you your
[53:02] experience is about greater because it's
[53:05] not experienced from the outside but now
[53:07] you're taking it in and that's how it is
[53:10] with God
[53:10] open your mouth wide the Bible says
[53:14] drink him in drink him him and went what
[53:19] Christ become a revelation to you it's
[53:21] like a baby being born
[53:23] a revelation right that's why you eat
[53:25] the word the bleeding bloody Word of God
[53:28] you eat it you gotta eat it people
[53:31] you'll never get stronger in the Lord
[53:33] but I don't care how much music you
[53:35] listen to
[53:35] and you know I love music but music
[53:38] won't transform me the word has been
[53:40] designed to transform you right
[53:44] amen so you must understand you're
[53:47] eating this in his this way it's not oh
[53:49] how many times you wished you were you
[53:52] were
[53:53] I wanted to be at least a 6-3 6-4 that's
[53:57] what I wanted out I thank God he didn't
[53:59] allowed it to happen because I really
[54:01] would have been playing basketball God
[54:04] wouldn't let it to happen you know I had
[54:05] all those brothers and everything taller
[54:07] than me and I'm short compared to the
[54:09] rest but I wanted to be tall but God
[54:13] knew no matter how much I wanted to be
[54:15] tall I'm still 510 511 I know I shrank a
[54:19] little bit so I think I'm giving myself
[54:20] a few more inches hallelujah but I'm
[54:24] trying to what I'm trying to say is that
[54:26] God load and make you this the way he
[54:29] wanted you to be right you can't sing
[54:32] like me I can't sing like you you can't
[54:35] preach like me don't come in here
[54:37] worshipping like I worship right you do
[54:40] not want that you don't want my spirit
[54:42] you want the Holy Ghost hallelujah it's
[54:47] all about Jesus Christ in you that's
[54:50] what truth is and we said all the movies
[54:53] on the bride but the move is on those
[54:55] who are have the Holy Ghost only inside
[54:59] of them hallelujah and we look for
[55:01] something so thank tax tastic you know
[55:04] we breathe in and out every day breathe
[55:07] or we and we hardly ever say would thank
[55:09] God for my breath we don't but it's so
[55:13] simple he's been with us all the time
[55:14] till it become common until you can't
[55:17] hardly breathe then you realize how
[55:19] important that is all about hallelujah
[55:25] and the Holy Ghost is so simple
[55:27] sometimes we don't even know he's there
[55:29] and he's dead trying to bring a change
[55:35] in your life trying to deal with you
[55:37] trying to do something amen by God's
[55:40] grace yes and and I'm not going to be
[55:43] much longer but I'm just trying to get
[55:46] to encourage you that you know we must
[55:48] have the divine nature on the inside it
[55:51] if God told Nicodemus you must be born
[55:53] again I'm listening I've been listening
[55:55] to the question and answers all this
[55:57] weekend last week and just heard some
[56:00] fantastic things they may may or may I
[56:03] heard before but it just seemed to all
[56:05] become
[56:07] you know illuminated you know and and
[56:09] when we when we see by God's grace that
[56:12] you know let me say like the Bible says
[56:15] we're about are given unto us exceeding
[56:17] great and precious promises that by
[56:20] these you might be partakers of the
[56:23] divine nature having escaped the
[56:25] corruption that it's in the world
[56:27] through the lust now let me say it like
[56:29] this if you're not preaching on truth
[56:34] and the truth is not a part of your life
[56:37] see whatever wherever you become
[56:41] perverted it is an avenue for a
[56:44] perverted spirit am i making sense for
[56:49] example when even Adam perverted the
[56:53] word by just adding the word not and
[56:55] understand perverting god's word is
[56:58] changing the meaning of anything that
[57:01] changes the meaning of what he's saying
[57:05] perverts it and that word not perverted
[57:09] the very thought of god and it was the
[57:13] gateway to all the fallen angels do you
[57:18] know as long as Eve stood and Adam stood
[57:20] Satan couldn't get in everything was
[57:24] pure everything was honest everything
[57:26] was just everything was holy but when
[57:29] when she broke the word it was a gateway
[57:32] in all the fallen angels that were
[57:34] behind Lucifer was now able to enter
[57:37] into the human race and brother Branham
[57:40] said it like this he said listen he said
[57:42] he said men died but the spirits don't
[57:45] and if the spirit don't die then where
[57:49] are they now
[57:50] where is the spirit that are norton
[57:53] Mussolini where is the spirit amen that
[57:56] an anointed Hitler where are these
[57:59] spirits hiding where the medal said
[58:01] these spirits left Europe and came to
[58:05] America and he tells us that here in
[58:09] America in where Hollywood but the devil
[58:13] now he changes his tactics of war
[58:16] because his whole intent is not just to
[58:19] kill the flesh
[58:20] to destroy the soul and so now he didn't
[58:23] fight him he develops this television
[58:25] set and he develops Amen a way of
[58:28] getting into you see those of us who are
[58:32] sealed with the Holy Ghost doesn't mean
[58:34] that the devil can get in your spirit
[58:35] the devil can anoint your spirit whip
[58:40] the Holy Ghost he can annoy your spirit
[58:42] and it is no spirit Amen that he will
[58:46] manifest himself through even though you
[58:48] got the Holy Ghost and so that the devil
[58:52] does he come through the tube you don't
[58:54] even know it's there how many times Oh
[58:56] Lord and not even knowing you know you
[59:00] you know football going on I love soccer
[59:02] I'm tell my debt that kind of football
[59:04] going on and all of a sudden you know
[59:06] you're looking at that thing and he
[59:07] scored he go oh you didn't even know you
[59:10] were there but in your spirit you were
[59:13] there hallelujah y'all understand me in
[59:20] your spirit you were there you you what
[59:23] you passed through the tube you went all
[59:26] the way to England wherever it was
[59:28] happening and you were there hey huh so
[59:33] you got to understand by God's grace and
[59:35] then if you can in tune yourself to the
[59:37] word the preacher would take you there
[59:41] is that the truth when he preached on
[59:44] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego if you are
[59:46] in tune in the word all of a sudden you
[59:48] become one of the character if not all
[59:50] three hallelujah and so you got to
[59:55] realize hey man this is truth to a true
[59:58] believer and I'm closing - a true
[1:00:01] believer this is you this is your
[1:00:04] identity right you take the message and
[1:00:07] you take the this Bible and you put it
[1:00:09] together and ask God give me
[1:00:11] understanding because a brother branham
[1:00:13] said when she begins to see who she
[1:00:15] really is she will become an invincible
[1:00:18] army and i'ma tell you the truth right
[1:00:21] now I am invincible because I got him on
[1:00:27] the inside you are to those of us Amen
[1:00:30] who are full of the Holy Spirit you have
[1:00:31] him
[1:00:34] right we can get ready for communion I
[1:00:39] can't I'm not gonna be able to finish
[1:00:40] the thought but my thought my thing is
[1:00:42] we've got communion tonight I almost
[1:00:43] forgot about it but but I want to say
[1:00:47] this to your people yeah brother Adam
[1:00:54] said it's it's very difficult for a
[1:00:55] pastor to get the people to really see
[1:00:58] the vision for some reason like I said
[1:01:07] there are no great great ministries you
[1:01:09] know I mean we follow people instead of
[1:01:11] following Christ you know and I've seen
[1:01:16] special when I was in Lima Ohio I've
[1:01:18] seen different ministers because of
[1:01:21] their name come by my church and preach
[1:01:22] the same thing out preach and the
[1:01:24] preacher before I'm thinking I just
[1:01:29] preached that yesterday it is something
[1:01:33] about other personalities right oh oh
[1:01:39] you say you know my wife give this
[1:01:41] sister a recipe of a pound cake and you
[1:01:44] know I meet my wife cake and it's okay
[1:01:46] it's okay because I've got in common
[1:01:48] it's become common it's still good and
[1:01:50] then the sister can bring a piece of
[1:01:52] cake over you show oh my goodness and
[1:01:57] you don't even know that's your wife
[1:01:58] recipe you understand but it's something
[1:02:02] about this right that makes us want
[1:02:06] something extra something different
[1:02:10] hallelujah amen and you and I must
[1:02:12] understand that this message will never
[1:02:15] grow over understand it is not the
[1:02:19] intelligence of a man that gives him the
[1:02:22] truth of Revelation it is God's business
[1:02:28] God gives revelation you can be dumb as
[1:02:32] a doorknob and God has chosen you and
[1:02:34] he'll give you that revelation nobody
[1:02:36] else has ever seen before
[1:02:38] right but you know what i'ma tell you
[1:02:41] you gotta be watchful in closing how
[1:02:44] many are you might not remember I
[1:02:45] remember the brother who started he took
[1:02:48] the one quoted brother branham about the
[1:02:50] holy ghost without sensation he worked
[1:02:54] and all of a sudden all the gifts
[1:02:57] disappeared around the message all the
[1:03:00] power of God and nobody was watching it
[1:03:03] but me because I stayed true the Holy
[1:03:04] Ghost I stayed true and I'm watching
[1:03:08] this thing and I know the brother who
[1:03:10] started it because it started when he
[1:03:11] started it it kind of like shook it
[1:03:13] shook a little bit and the whole and
[1:03:15] sudden everybody started okay the Holy
[1:03:17] Ghost without sensation the Holy Ghost
[1:03:19] without sensation but they never could
[1:03:21] finish the quote about the life huh
[1:03:25] you kind of have the life if you don't
[1:03:27] have sensation you got to have the life
[1:03:31] have the Holy Ghost without sensation if
[1:03:33] you want to remember just like I try to
[1:03:35] tell people the Holy Ghost has always
[1:03:37] came without coming without sensation on
[1:03:39] the day of Pentecost they had sensation
[1:03:42] but they had the Holy Ghost before they
[1:03:44] had the sensation probably God just
[1:03:47] unveiled to us where the depth of
[1:03:50] because in the soul there are no
[1:03:52] emotions he said in the soul there's
[1:03:55] either faith or unbelief and when the
[1:03:57] Holy Ghost hid your soul your faith
[1:03:59] grabs it it's a revelation then all of a
[1:04:02] sudden as he comes up like a well of
[1:04:05] water springing up into eternal life it
[1:04:07] lose from the soul to your spirit and
[1:04:10] your spirit reacts and your flesh reacts
[1:04:14] but the birth came in your soul always
[1:04:18] have because God never have sex with his
[1:04:22] people hmm
[1:04:25] so but people were all holy goes with
[1:04:28] our sensations holy goes without
[1:04:29] sensation now you don't even have people
[1:04:32] praying because they gave away the
[1:04:34] sensation hmm see they gave away
[1:04:41] the emotional thing why do you think God
[1:04:43] gave you motion your emotions came
[1:04:45] because he wants you to worship you with
[1:04:46] him with it
[1:04:47] what do you think music is all about why
[1:04:49] did he love David David was very
[1:04:51] emotional am I am I am I going to long
[1:04:57] but my thing is this because people
[1:05:01] didn't listen and so many people right
[1:05:04] now don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:05] because preachers have gotten lazy
[1:05:08] nobody want to pray with people and
[1:05:11] people don't want to pray long enough
[1:05:14] hello and most of the time now people
[1:05:17] don't even preachers don't even know how
[1:05:19] to pray they hadn't prayed in in a long
[1:05:22] time for hours it's the truth people
[1:05:25] it's the truth
[1:05:26] they don't want to labor deposit labor
[1:05:29] to enter into his rest you labor when
[1:05:34] you really want God you act like you act
[1:05:36] like blind Bartimaeus Jesus not son of
[1:05:39] David have mercy on me you know you
[1:05:42] start praying like that even people in
[1:05:44] the prayer like oh my god I can't
[1:05:45] concentrate you can't concentrate cuz
[1:05:47] you're not praying you're praying but
[1:05:50] you're not praying when you pray you
[1:05:53] pray you know you shut he said
[1:05:56] you got this you got to shut off that
[1:05:59] sound barrier
[1:06:00] oh that brother's too loud that's
[1:06:02] sisters tuna you got to go B yah lord
[1:06:05] help me listen it might become a
[1:06:07] shouting match because somehow I'm gonna
[1:06:11] break through and I'm gonna close you
[1:06:13] off I'm gonna reach that place where
[1:06:16] that sound barrier break
[1:06:17] boo and I'm gonna sail to that find him
[1:06:21] he finds me you understand me
[1:06:26] I'm not saying everybody had to get it
[1:06:29] that way but I will say because the the
[1:06:31] perfect way of getting your Holy Ghost
[1:06:33] is by the preaching of the gospel the
[1:06:36] Bible said they heard the word and the
[1:06:38] Holy Ghost failed
[1:06:39] that is the perfect way but because of
[1:06:43] our day and time sometimes you have to
[1:06:46] labor just to get people to deny it's
[1:06:49] all it's about is to surrender simple it
[1:06:54] really is
[1:06:55] but men as men we love the harder way we
[1:06:59] loved it we have to go the hard way
[1:07:01] brother branham never never did say it
[1:07:03] was wrong man fact he prayed and labored
[1:07:05] with people y'all remember that if you
[1:07:08] don't recall that I'm just gonna give
[1:07:10] you one tape that's God and simplicity
[1:07:13] right after the seals right at the end
[1:07:16] brother branham is helping a Pentecostal
[1:07:19] brother labor with the people to get the
[1:07:21] Holy Ghost best and we're gonna read the
[1:07:24] scripture I know there's a lot of issues
[1:07:35] that goes on and I heard brother Branham
[1:07:38] he said for the man said I preached by
[1:07:40] inspiration and I believe if I am which
[1:07:44] are which all ministers are those who
[1:07:49] verse who are really called by God we
[1:07:51] preached by inspiration I love the
[1:07:59] people of God and I want to see I want
[1:08:02] to see people make a rapture the Bible
[1:08:06] said make your call and election sure
[1:08:08] well some of us have already made it
[1:08:12] sure I want to encourage everybody I
[1:08:16] don't care like I said wherever God
[1:08:19] found you he knew what you were and what
[1:08:22] you was all about before he called you
[1:08:24] but one thing that God placed in that
[1:08:27] old dirty dirt of yours was a seeding of
[1:08:29] representation and nobody can take that
[1:08:32] from you Corinthians says and such were
[1:08:36] some of you
[1:08:37] and in Corinthians he named all my sins
[1:08:41] and things but he said in some of you
[1:08:43] were there saying I wish I could say in
[1:08:46] a way that praise God when God saved me
[1:08:49] I didn't have no problems I had a lot of
[1:08:51] problems and I mean I was graced to have
[1:08:54] a wife as patient and it's loving as she
[1:08:56] has been toward me because I really
[1:09:00] believe if I had chosen a different one
[1:09:02] we wouldn't have we wouldn't have a wife
[1:09:04] today and therefore I wouldn't be
[1:09:05] standing but I show thank God for
[1:09:09] his grace and His mercy I think I love
[1:09:11] truth I uh like I said nothing will
[1:09:15] change my heart I I've seen friends who
[1:09:18] brought me to this message Walker walk
[1:09:20] away who could take this Bible quote it
[1:09:23] almost verbatim quotes verbatim and and
[1:09:26] and they walk away and deny the prophet
[1:09:28] in his ministry well I don't have that
[1:09:32] in me and III have to do it do
[1:09:37] everything the way God showed me to do
[1:09:38] because you know at the end of the day I
[1:09:40] would have to give an account now if I
[1:09:44] go straight of the word is you obligated
[1:09:47] to tell me you obligated to show me
[1:09:50] where I'm wrong and you know like I said
[1:09:53] show me it depends on how you you know
[1:09:57] how to say nobody really fresh don't
[1:09:59] like correction but the soul does and my
[1:10:04] soul says yes my soul says yes I love
[1:10:10] this word I love the people of God I
[1:10:12] want to tell you in my closing this is
[1:10:16] don't ever don't brothers sisters I know
[1:10:18] some of y'all been raised in it I'm
[1:10:20] telling you your parents can't give you
[1:10:22] no greater treasure if they had given if
[1:10:25] they had a million dollars to give you
[1:10:27] it wouldn't out to nothing compared to
[1:10:30] what they'd given you what they're
[1:10:32] trying to do we god has has preserved
[1:10:35] you and protected you from this evil age
[1:10:37] and brought got you parents that are
[1:10:40] trying to teach you right trying to
[1:10:42] teach you what is truth don't stray
[1:10:44] please because they've given you
[1:10:46] something that's more precious than gold
[1:10:48] more precious than gold and somehow you
[1:10:54] got to ask God show me give me
[1:10:57] understanding of what my parents are
[1:10:59] seeing don't say oh I want to go out I
[1:11:01] want to do this I want to do that it's
[1:11:04] the trick of the devil it really is and
[1:11:09] encourage your brothers and your sisters
[1:11:12] these young people you know y'all got so
[1:11:14] much to deal with encourage your
[1:11:17] brothers and sisters that this is right
[1:11:18] even if you don't even see it right now
[1:11:21] you know it's right
[1:11:22] I just know if I go to hell I guess I go
[1:11:26] to hell riding on this message but I
[1:11:29] don't I don't fear hell death all agree
[1:11:32] because I passed from death unto life
[1:11:34] and you know I thank God for his mercy
[1:11:38] let us turn to first Corinthians first
[1:11:42] corinthians the 11th chapter i
[1:11:45] appreciate your patience i appreciate
[1:11:47] for those of you who come from iowa city
[1:11:50] i know it's a long drive but i really i
[1:11:53] really i am really encouraged every time
[1:11:57] i see you because i know i know the
[1:11:59] sacrifice that you make and and you got
[1:12:01] to go back and go to work and things
[1:12:03] like that if I appreciate it God does to
[1:12:06] you 1st Corinthians the 11th chapter
[1:12:09] we'll start reading at the 23rd verse by
[1:12:12] a received of the Lord that which also I
[1:12:14] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:12:17] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:12:21] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:12:24] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:12:27] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:12:30] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:12:32] also he took the cup when he had supped
[1:12:35] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:12:39] my blood this do ye as oft as you drink
[1:12:42] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:12:45] you eat this bread and drink this cup ye
[1:12:48] do show the Lord's death till he come
[1:12:51] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:12:53] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:12:55] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:12:58] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:13:00] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:13:03] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[1:13:06] that eateth and drinketh unworthily he
[1:13:09] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:13:11] not discerning the Lord's body but this
[1:13:15] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:13:17] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:13:19] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:13:23] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:13:25] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:13:28] with the world well for my brethren when
[1:13:31] you come together to eat tarry one for
[1:13:34] another and if any
[1:13:36] in hunger let him eat at home that you
[1:13:39] come not together unto condemnation and
[1:13:41] the rest I was set in order when I come
[1:13:51] we'll prepare a sky brother toy to come
[1:13:54] help us as I go in all hearts and minds
[1:14:00] clear
