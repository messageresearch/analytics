[1:23:09] sometime I preach but it's not only me
[1:23:12] it's not only me the
[1:23:14] state state some they can like swallow
[1:23:19] when they speak English is
[1:23:21] like I don't
[1:23:23] understand some is a clear so it's it's

[1:23:45] wondering today it's what happen
[1:23:50] happening are we really getting the
[1:23:53] people to
[1:23:56] God or are we just getting them to
[1:24:01] church we must get them to
[1:24:06] Christ where this quicking
[1:24:12] power
[1:24:14] good to go to
[1:24:17] church sure it it does the far as we go
[1:24:22] it's not far
[1:24:26] enough when you when you come to
[1:24:30] church it's that's good that's good but
[1:24:34] go on to
[1:24:37] Christ from the
[1:24:40] church because we must receive this
[1:24:43] quickening
[1:24:47] power if we ever expect to be in that
[1:24:51] generation
[1:24:58] Resurrection correct because it's the
[1:25:01] only things that will ever bring us from
[1:25:04] the
[1:25:07] dead for it's the spirit that raise up
[1:25:12] Jesus from the dead dwelling in
[1:25:18] you it will also quickening make bring
[1:25:22] to life
[1:25:26] your promise to us hallelujah CL the
[1:25:29] hand for the Lord amen
[1:25:32] amen praise the
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:36] Lord this is it's for
[1:25:40] preachers we have also a role to
[1:25:44] play where are youing the
[1:25:47] people you know uh let's B said
[1:25:52] those people they go to the night
[1:25:55] club they listen to those
[1:26:00] music some people they can bring
[1:26:02] nightclub on the road that can be on the
[1:26:04] traffic light they just put those bases
[1:26:07] Bo I want this to be I want to go here
[1:26:11] they just bring night club on the
[1:26:14] road is next to you you can feel
[1:26:21] that so I don't know how he's surviving
[1:26:26] himself so those
[1:26:29] music no matter what they can singing
[1:26:31] they don't send they don't speak the
[1:26:33] word that go and kill go and shoot but
[1:26:36] they just said other
[1:26:42] words but the intention of that music
[1:26:46] there there is a small voice in The
[1:26:50] Voice amen though they don't say it
[1:26:53] that's why go straight in their music
[1:26:55] and go to those those young
[1:26:59] people and from the nightclub they went
[1:27:02] to shoot they start to kill people from
[1:27:07] theic intention behind the
[1:27:14] word it's very
[1:27:17] important that's why you have to choose
[1:27:19] even if the music you are listening
[1:27:24] Jesus you don't you don't know the
[1:27:26] intention of that Jesus they are talking
[1:27:29] about amen just check yourself there is
[1:27:32] a some gospel when you listen to it
[1:27:37] can't check
[1:27:39] yourself some music after listening to
[1:27:45] it some music you become
[1:27:49] nervous he say you you want to watch a
[1:27:51] movie
[1:27:56] which kind of music it send you to other
[1:28:00] feelings but it's a
[1:28:04] gospel this is the world we are
[1:28:06] living when sitting there you are not
[1:28:10] the real
[1:28:12] you you you are inside of

[1:29:45] kick people far away you start to judge
[1:29:49] them no they are using the principle of
[1:29:52] the
[1:29:56] Bible and when they using
[1:29:59] this and because the principle is not
[1:30:02] the devil put a
[1:30:04] principle God put the
[1:30:07] principle but yourself the Son of God
