[8:11] amen and I thank God for use of some
[8:13] brutes amen I think all four brother

[8:18] people kind of know that he can get you
[8:21] and then you can't get out Amy so nice
[8:25] and you know now when I come you know I
[8:27] saw a lot of preachers and I thought oh
[8:29] this might be kind of mean
[8:30] what brother Brooks is real nice but he
[8:32] was still strict but I didn't know that
[8:34] amen but he loved me and he said brother
[8:37] this is not the right condition for you
[8:39] amen and he took me in and I thank you
[8:42] brother Brooks amen
[8:44] I got a lot of bumps and bruises amen
[8:47] but the tree is grown the straight amen
[8:50] I'm thinking I thank God for you
[8:51] amen and they have done that I know all
[8:54] the young people I know y'all got the
[8:55] same testimony how he done for and that
[8:57] love that's there amen when he moved to
[9:00] Ohio and you know a lot of people won't
[9:02] go out of their little circle but I
[9:03] followed him all the way to Lima and
[9:05] Amen I'm all the way up in Iowa no
[9:08] matter where he goes they men Amen cuz I
[9:10] love both of them amen amen so I want to
[9:13] get into word just a moment and and you
[9:16] know as I tell every you know it
[9:18] wherever I go I don't like for people to
[9:21] feel like well that message is not for
[9:23] me
[9:24] Amen I want you to know that the message
[9:26] is for you whether you are young or old
[9:28] married or single amen and so you all
[9:33] just pray for me cuz it could be for
[9:35] your child amen and it is for your child
[9:38] amen but we want to use the Holy Spirit
[9:41] to pack these messages in my heart amen
[9:44] some weeks ago and that we would share
[9:47] this and so we'll be on this just for
[9:49] the duration while I'm here and on the
[9:52] series of season times and purpose amen
[9:56] to everything there's a season of time
[9:59] and a purpose and I don't like you know
[10:02] for people to try to escape the message
[10:05] amen
[10:06] you know I heard a preacher say one time
[10:08] that people shoveled a message you know
[10:10] when it comes they say oh yeah yeah that
[10:12] was for them and that was for them you
[10:15] know and all of us are saying all the
[10:18] same we'll try to get out of it but this
[10:20] message for you so point tu7 said this
[10:22] message is for me amen
[10:26] point to your neighbor tell them this
[10:28] message is for you tell them
[10:30] in case they tried to get out of it all
[10:34] right it's for all of us
[10:35] amen very beautiful how the Holy Spirit
[10:38] allowed amen it to be written that there
[10:41] are times and seasons and I want to do a
[10:43] spiritual checklist for all of us just
[10:45] to make sure before we get to heart of
[10:48] the message and to peel back and to look
[10:50] at it that don't you worry
[10:53] God is on the scene and God is faithful
[10:59] Amen you know I think what sometimes I
[11:02] think my brother Brooks say sometimes
[11:04] you know I have to calm myself down
[11:06] because I get so excited when I look and
[11:09] peek at what God has already done and
[11:12] then if that has been done and if it's
[11:14] true that what God is doing now and what
[11:18] he's gonna do in the future I just don't
[11:20] see how to come and have a frown I mean
[11:23] I don't know how to come to church and
[11:25] be sad even when I'm sick I don't know
[11:28] how to do it I wish I could sit still
[11:31] and not move but my toes would move
[11:33] something would get the move I just
[11:35] because God has been so good to the
[11:38] church I hope this encourage you that
[11:43] it's all right amen
[11:45] times seasons purposes amen now let's do
[11:51] this before we break into the message I
[11:52] want us to look at this verse in Chapter
[11:55] 9 verse 11 so that you'll understand you
[11:57] won't escape no matter what war brother
[12:01] you don't know how many mistakes on me
[12:03] you don't know how many I mean amen
[12:07] but the Bible says all have sinned and
[12:10] come short while they were growing no
[12:14] that's what you wasn't before you got
[12:15] saved amen
[12:18] yes amen alright so I don't go there so
[12:21] let's just go right to it now all right
[12:22] so let's look at the script here it just
[12:25] says I returned this on Sunday the race
[12:27] is not to the Swift the battle is not to
[12:29] the strong yet the bread is not to the
[12:31] wise I'm gonna read this another way all
[12:34] right
[12:34] nor yet riches to men of understanding
[12:37] nor favor to men of skill but time and
[12:39] chance happens to all how many believe
[12:41] that time and chance happens to
[12:43] everybody
[12:44] is that the word so then let me read it
[12:48] like this
[12:50] King jet Jasper's version the race is
[12:58] given to the Swift and the slow cuz
[13:04] people say well I'm not fast enough
[13:06] no but the Swift and the slope half the
[13:10] race everybody Whitman yes that's what
[13:15] it says it's not given to cuz we cause
[13:17] people like to get out of it see and see
[13:19] so and then the next part of it says
[13:22] sold the strong and the weak have to
[13:25] fight amen
[13:28] can I get amen I'm just trying to
[13:30] because somebody's not gonna save me
[13:32] because well I'm so glad he didn't get
[13:33] to me the wise and the unwise must find
[13:38] bread that's true men of understanding
[13:42] and ignorant men can be wealthy I don't
[13:47] play the lottery but you could play the
[13:48] lottery and you could win you might lose
[13:51] mostly but you could win how many
[13:53] understand you can get wealth any kind
[13:56] of way it doesn't have anything to do
[13:58] with it the skilled and the unskilled
[14:00] can find favor how many know that's the
[14:02] truth that's all through the Bible I
[14:05] just will try not to go there but it's
[14:07] just all through the Bible amen
[14:09] in other words I want you to understand
[14:11] that you are not exempt stop making
[14:14] excuses amen
[14:18] I see you can just forget now if you get
[14:22] sleepy you go and fall asleep now
[14:24] but you won't get by that you won't get
[14:27] before God with any excuse that you
[14:29] didn't do anything because you were too
[14:32] short too tall or too smart
[14:36] amen how many understand we all will
[14:39] have to give an account of what you've
[14:41] heard and what you see and what you've
[14:44] accepted and what you have believed what
[14:47] will you do with that what you claim to
[14:49] believe oh my
[14:54] um I'm doing you like brother Brooks now
[14:55] you didn't come to church so I wish I
[14:57] would have stayed home no you here now
[14:59] you gonna get it you're gonna get it
[15:02] amen amen but I mean well amen
[15:04] all right so now let's go back in Cleese
[15:06] Acts the third chapter and we just will
[15:07] take our time here to do this checklist
[15:09] before I give you just a snapshot of
[15:11] season times and purpose they are so
[15:14] perfect God is so perfect
[15:17] it just excites me now you know that's
[15:20] what preachers do pictures have to hold
[15:22] you just a minute get y'all suspenseful
[15:24] it wonder which way we going but don't
[15:26] you worry I'm coming straight to you yes
[15:29] in Cleese acid3 let's look at it real
[15:32] quickly please ask the third chapter
[15:35] amen and verse let's just take verse
[15:40] three to everything there is a season
[15:42] Saint with me there's a season and a
[15:46] time to every purpose all right under
[15:51] heaven so y'all see that as a season
[15:53] there's a time and to every purpose
[15:56] under heaven
[15:58] there's a time to be born a time to die
[16:00] a time to plant time to plug up that one
[16:02] splint in other words what I want you
[16:04] understand is this season now seasons
[16:06] are general right but no matter what
[16:12] they will come amen now you could get
[16:16] some rain out of season but it's a
[16:19] guarantee when the season comes for the
[16:21] rain it's gonna rain I'm gonna know that
[16:24] I mean I know it sometimes it could seem
[16:26] like it's not gonna happen
[16:28] but just as Shores there's a heaven and
[16:30] there's a god those seasons will not
[16:33] miss they're gonna be there I think God
[16:37] for those seasons I thank God now how
[16:40] many of miss song yes I've missed a lot
[16:43] of them Amen but I thank God see when
[16:45] you miss them just don't worry those
[16:48] three or four months because the next
[16:50] four or five months those seasons gonna
[16:52] come back what will you do when they
[16:54] come back how many have you missed it
[16:56] doesn't matter you are next to the next
[17:01] one are you exiting the one that you
[17:03] missed but there's another one coming
[17:05] and
[17:06] so glad this morning yes I am
[17:10] yes seasons seasons of general you get
[17:13] about four months and that's what people
[17:15] do
[17:15] I mean they're human they waste a lot of
[17:17] time cuz I got three or four months but
[17:20] you know there if you got a plan of
[17:22] garden you have to plant at the right
[17:24] time you have to break up the ground
[17:27] before you plant amen
[17:33] seasons or general but now and see it
[17:37] see but then when you catch the season
[17:39] then the time becomes lost specific now
[17:46] you can make all the excuse you want but
[17:49] everybody get 24 hours and I understand
[17:53] you need more sleep but everybody get
[17:54] the same number of hours to sleep and
[17:56] you can't sleep at all hoping God gonna
[17:59] give you a dream and then you've got to
[18:06] work some of it you've got the labor
[18:08] some and then you need to go to sleep
[18:10] sometime amen
[18:15] times get more specific see when you
[18:20] catch those times
[18:21] there are certain times in the day when
[18:23] there's a whole lot of noise a lot of
[18:25] fuss people are doing all kind of the
[18:27] humming no time talking about amen and
[18:30] then there's certain times in the
[18:31] morning when people apply the devil
[18:34] don't beat people up enough so they
[18:36] figured it go to sleep and that's the
[18:38] best time to get there before God it's
[18:41] the quiet time the early morning even
[18:43] before the crows before people
[18:45] decide to get up Amen God is already up
[18:48] and if you can sneak away and get there
[18:51] before him what you couldn't hear in the
[18:53] daytime because there was so much noise
[18:54] God's voice but begin to be like water
[18:57] into your soul sweet waters pouring into
[19:01] my soul until police and I don't need
[19:04] answers I just need to be near him Oh
[19:08] hallelujah sometimes a man I forget I've
[19:12] go before God I'm there I'm just so glad
[19:14] that I made it inside
[19:16] and when I get there I forgot that I
[19:18] need to ask him about something because
[19:21] I'm so happy to be in his presence
[19:23] there's nothing like the presence of God
[19:26] no man can go there and be the same no
[19:31] you won't stand there before God with
[19:33] your intellectualism and all your
[19:35] achievements they'll all vanish the way
[19:37] you'll say woe is me how naked I am just
[19:41] seeing that I didn't even know about
[19:43] it's sitting there on my sleeve I
[19:45] thought I was something but when I get
[19:47] before God I recognize all retching man
[19:51] that I am Oh God
[19:54] I know we need things this oppression on
[19:58] preachers because people want the
[20:00] preacher to give it to him he won't the
[20:05] answer people want to answer from the
[20:07] preacher let's say at our preacher time
[20:10] and chance happens to everybody
[20:12] I want the preacher to get up one
[20:18] morning say y'all I don't have an answer
[20:20] I don't know what we don't do I don't
[20:24] know what God is gonna do and I want to
[20:27] see people say but God is faithful Carl
[20:31] don't say nothing and people praise God
[20:34] anyway oh god help us Oh times don't
[20:41] miss those times with God they're
[20:43] perfect amen
[20:44] those seasons you got time to adjust
[20:47] yourself and we all do it I'm not immune
[20:50] we all say woe is me I'm too short you
[20:53] know I'm not gonna get this look like
[20:54] every time I try to grow it grows this
[20:56] way I'm trying to grow this way but it
[20:57] goes this way or that way yes times the
[21:03] seasons when time come is more specific
[21:06] and then a man once you get the timing
[21:09] down get the time that then the purpose
[21:12] car Oh God I can't tell you there's no
[21:17] happier place then to understand that
[21:20] you wasn't called to do with that one
[21:24] there's no happier place and you know
[21:26] what people try to do they try and the
[21:28] world is guilty and
[21:30] Church is guilty the church won't their

[24:09] it just says God is right and we all got
[24:12] to adjust to that amen I don't want you
[24:14] to think that I leaving somebody out and
[24:16] I know know you'll see that you'll know
[24:17] what yourself we all get guilt we get
[24:20] mixed up amen so then seasons of general
[24:24] Tanz of specific purposes of death
[24:26] because you are designed the way you
[24:30] already are stop fumbling with that part
[24:33] of it is that all right
[24:38] amen stop saying I wish I could have all
[24:41] wish I could do this think about it
[24:44] there's something you are designed for
[24:45] in the church and there's not two people
[24:48] in the church doing the same thing I
[24:51] understand we all think we can sing like
[24:53] brother Brooks I'm just saying but there
[25:00] won't be two brother Brooks how many no
[25:02] that's the truth it cannot be it cannot
[25:06] it must be one genuine and another one
[25:09] genuine the way they were built is that
[25:13] Alright yes specific then your design a
[25:17] certain way because of your purpose you
[25:23] design a certain way because of your
[25:26] purpose your design certain way it's
[25:33] what I can't put up with people because
[25:35] you wasn't designed to some time I want
[25:41] our brother Bruce and sister Brooke have
[25:43] done what they're doing but I've learned
[25:45] even back then to just accept it it is a
[25:49] god thing it's far beyond what you could
[25:54] imagine trying in other words someone
[25:56] said well I'm gonna try to do that and
[25:58] you don't have the patience you don't
[25:59] have benders
[26:00] that doesn't mean they don't get tired
[26:01] don't get you know I'm thinking how a
[26:04] person even have enough love to bring me
[26:07] on in and then to have that The Tempest
[26:10] brother Bruce goes out and I've seen him
[26:12] do it go out and get one more and bring
[26:15] them in and then she's chop on him a
[26:17] little bit and then he chop on a little
[26:19] bit and then she chop on a little bit
[26:22] and then they making one little mo God
[26:24] can do that with all of us if we'll get
[26:26] in our place everything does
[26:35] timed as a season as a purpose all right
[26:37] so I want you to see that these things
[26:39] happen now let's just do let's lighten
[26:42] up a little bit can we lighten up let's
[26:44] back off a little bit
[26:45] look look at it please exit three I
[26:47] don't want you all to take your Bibles
[26:48] take the equally section three and you
[26:50] do this when you go home I want you to
[26:52] do a spiritual checklist of your times
[26:55] your seasons and your purpose you amen
[26:58] that's what's most important not what
[27:00] somebody else did or what somebody else
[27:02] is gonna do what is yours all right

[27:11] everything to the season for every
[27:13] activity on this under heaven amen and
[27:15] verse two said is a time to be born a
[27:18] time to die
[27:18] now we could stop there because you know
[27:21] your birth nothing could have
[27:24] constructed it but God's mind set you
[27:30] couldn't have no other parents to make
[27:33] you who you are that's the truth oh I
[27:38] wish I had this one no you have the
[27:41] parents you have for a reason all right
[27:46] verse two this time you want there's a
[27:48] time to plant and there's a time to
[27:50] uproot that means you have have you
[27:53] started anything yet are you constantly
[27:57] planning and have not started see
[28:01] planning is starting something there and
[28:03] then there's a time to uproot there's a
[28:05] time when you need to stop doing
[28:07] something's you don't need to preach it
[28:09] ain't come well if the preachers say get
[28:11] real let it go you know in your own
[28:12] conscious you ought not be doing that by

[28:19] I just gave you a second witness there's
[28:23] a time to plant things there's time to
[28:25] start things and there are times to reap
[28:28] things and listen if you don't up root
[28:30] it what's in the ground will grow all of
[28:32] the pretty plants that you don't plant
[28:34] it and before you know it you don't have
[28:37] the stamina to keep going because you
[28:40] got thorns and roots and things in that
[28:42] you didn't dig up before you started
[28:44] planning how many no that's nothing but
[28:46] the truth

[30:45] amen just before brother Brooks asked
[30:47] y'all to sing a little more it had the
[30:49] thought entered into my heart and I
[30:51] thought I guess the musician or not I

[30:55] said now I know I should be hearing the
[30:57] people singing I know that my cane that
[30:59] closed in and know

[45:44] that rope in the heart of the Christian
[45:47] rolling down there bouncing on the top
[45:50] of that water by itself and then that
[45:52] bucket sometimes God won't give you a
[45:53] full drink the bucket of Jason you know

[45:57] water and it'll lean just a little bit
[45:59] to get that bucket the link or the rope
[46:00] get a little sometimes you got to just
[46:02] go and stay there before God don't be

[48:25] sneak by and find you when you don't
[48:27] forgot all about it
[48:29] and God can pull on you I mean knowing
[48:32] somebody you're gone and Moses then the

[49:01] how many thank God for the tree and the
[49:02] fire yes we could make without the tree
[49:05] without cow ball tree and the holy ghost
[49:08] fire yes and God sent the tree down and
[49:12] Moses and the fire and all of a sudden
[49:14] the voice that he had heard all along
[49:17] begin to be clearer I'm gonna know it
[49:20] was the voice our Moses could hear that
[49:22] voice before now how many know that's
[49:24] the truth yes that's what made him won't
[49:27] you know get upset he got upset he knew
[49:30] something was wrong something his Noor
[49:32] was moving around he knew this is not
[49:34] right you shouldn't be treating people
[49:36] that way they didn't know how to work it
[49:38] though I didn't know how you didn't know
[49:39] how to put your hand in here take your
[49:42] hand back out Moses oh that's how I work
[49:44] see see gotta take that so now he in
[49:47] season it's coming around again it's all
[49:50] mine he said oh my god I'm speaking to
[49:53] God this thing is happening I'm there
[49:54] before the pillar of fire and I'm
[49:56] hearing the voice of God saying Moses
[49:59] take your hand put it in pull it back
[50:02] out Moses Oh hallelujah what a time that
[50:05] was now the season was beginning to line
[50:07] up that time I was lining up and way
[50:10] before Moses a promise was spoken that I
[50:14] remember - how bring my people out
[50:16] Oh hallelujah they beginning to line up
[50:20] oh my what exciting time the faint when
[50:24] your life begin to line up when the
[50:27] season line up wouldn't of timing line
[50:31] up and you've got the right purpose you
[50:33] know how you design you won't get out
[50:36] there being a hypocrite
[50:37] you won't get I didn't try to act like
[50:38] somebody else don't try to use another
[50:41] man's minister what's in your hand Moses
[50:44] what's in your hand what have I taught
[50:48] you how to do oh my Moses so focused now
[50:52] he
[50:53] think about all the greater revivals
[50:55] because you know there was a great
[50:56] revivals before Moses they could have
[50:58] thought like that how many know they
[51:00] were greater reviles before Moses I tell
[51:03] people all the time
[51:04] they're great revivals all in history Oh
[51:11] God how many know that's the truth and
[51:14] they all spoke of the one to come and go
[51:19] cheese in that beautiful right there I
[51:22] hope you caught that right there in that
[51:25] beautiful
[51:26] don't you know Alexander Graham I think
[51:28] this is named spoke of a time to come
[51:32] great men of God spoke of the time to
[51:37] come before the 1900s cancers and things
[51:42] that they knew great moves of God in
[51:45] Africa we're already being done and they
[51:50] all predicted of another one to come and
[51:53] we are not without excuse cuz great
[51:58] those great oak trees said this is
[52:02] nothing when the move come upon the
[52:05] bride and she recognized have to come
[52:10] back hallelujah God never leaves himself
[52:15] without a witness what I'm trying to do
[52:18] is get people to look right down and
[52:19] with what's in your own hand cuz I'm
[52:21] responsible as a minister not to point
[52:24] you backwards but the point you fired
[52:28] get your season kept your time in you
[52:32] know all that lined up and then he got
[52:35] it right now see he didn't use these
[52:36] gifts a couple of times just before God
[52:38] you know you know and I don't know how
[52:40] all that worked but I can tell you this
[52:41] here sometimes I can speak for myself
[52:45] sometimes God won't do it like that
[52:49] sometimes God won't bring those gifts up
[52:52] till you get right up on the situation
[52:56] yes I know cuz see I would rather I
[53:00] would prefer to have it like that I know
[53:02] we all would I let me work these gifts
[53:05] before let me fear you know
[53:07] I'm gonna work this discernment you know
[53:08] with a mouse people want to do with a
[53:12] squirrel how many know what I'm talking
[53:14] right they want to be having and private
[53:15] you know and sometimes God won't work to
[53:18] you get you right in the situation
[53:22] sometime those gifts won't work till you
[53:24] get close enough cuz sometimes people
[53:26] won't get close to people they scatter
[53:28] people how many know what I'm talking
[53:30] about but you recognize there's nothing
[53:32] to that body butter shell one thing is
[53:34] in it or two or one of the other or two
[53:37] trying to fight how many know one
[53:39] termite there's a dog there or cat

[53:43] all you just don't worry about don't be
[53:45] afraid of dogs don't be afraid of cats
[53:47] how many know whichever one that person
[53:49] is feeding it's the strongest but it has
[53:51] nothing to do with you if God tells you
[53:53] to go there you go right up to that dog
[53:54] in that cat how many know what I'm
[53:56] talking about yes sir
[53:58] sometimes those gifts won't work like
[54:00] that he won't give you he won't let you

[54:21] God working amen
[54:23] all right so now Moses get to do this

[1:09:55] come amen let's give God I had a praise
[1:09:58] a man I'm so sorry to be so long I don't
[1:10:01] have a watch amen amen amen amen
[1:10:14] you know for those of you who may not
[1:10:17] even I'll say like this it was so simple
[1:10:19] and yet so powerful that's the way I
[1:10:21] love the Lord you know he likens himself
[1:10:23] is water not kool-aid or pop Amen just
[1:10:27] plain right and so I love that but let
[1:10:31] me say this the Bible tells us according
[1:10:34] to 1st John 3 and 9 whosoever is born of
[1:10:40] God does not commit things
[1:10:43] some of y'all when he said you can't
[1:10:46] make no mistakes in the eyes of God you
[1:10:48] cannot for his seed remaineth in him and
[1:10:53] he cannot say the Bobby doesn't say he
[1:10:57] will not it's impossible cannot means
[1:11:01] he's not a Babel - there is no ability
[1:11:05] in him to say oh my
[1:11:08] because he is born of God now I could
[1:11:13] take that a little further but it ain't
[1:11:15] mine dude it'll preach right now but my
[1:11:17] point is this some people that scripture
[1:11:19] scares it frightens them because they
[1:11:23] see because when you when that seed hit
[1:11:26] you I see what y'all see what I'm saying
[1:11:28] all your failures doesn't even matter to
[1:11:33] God the sin the sin offering has already
[1:11:38] been yeah that sin often covers all of
[1:11:43] your shortcomings and that's why the
[1:11:49] message you know as I was with Moses the
[1:11:52] prophet of God says this he said God is
[1:11:54] not even concerned with your fans he's
[1:11:57] only concerned about your purpose now I
[1:12:00] said it but in the way that I the
[1:12:03] revelation but that's exactly what he
[1:12:05] said so you and I we look at this thing
[1:12:08] I thank you brother because I've read
[1:12:11] that scripture many times I'm like time
[1:12:13] and chance you know like like God
[1:12:15] rolling dice no no no he's just saying
[1:12:18] that every time there is coming a season
[1:12:21] for everything yes and
[1:12:24] when you get he gives you the chance to
[1:12:27] do it right you don't make it right that
[1:12:30] season of chance come back around like
[1:12:32] with Moses I don't want to reap reach
[1:12:36] because the man gotta fittest in other
[1:12:39] words you gonna do what God says dude no
[1:12:42] matter how long it takes yeah
[1:12:48] y'all look at this clearly the word was
[1:12:51] spoken and i'ma say it like this
[1:12:55] the bride should have been gone by now
[1:13:00] we have had the time and we've had and
[1:13:03] chances with us right now
[1:13:06] but until we mature Moses had to mature
[1:13:10] in the desert God had to bring him to a
[1:13:15] certain Kyrie top right and I'ma tell
[1:13:20] you just like Jesus he had to suffer but
[1:13:22] he had to also come to sweetness and
[1:13:24] neatness because that's how he worn
[1:13:27] calorie it wasn't violence it was divine
[1:13:31] love right I am blessed brother
[1:13:37] thank you I I just trust everybody got
[1:13:40] it cuz every one of us have been full of
[1:13:43] mistakes and sometimes they'd ever say
[1:13:46] well you know you can't do that now
[1:13:47] because you did that lurk Moses murdered
[1:13:51] a man and he still did what God said -
[1:13:54] because of blood yeah and the grace of
[1:13:57] God you love the Lord I don't want to go
[1:14:02] any further because I don't only enter
[1:14:03] into his message but we were just
[1:14:05] talking about purpose you got to have a
[1:14:10] purpose you have a purpose and I was
[1:14:13] just saying you know think about it that
[1:14:16] little ball with a few fish and loaves
[1:14:17] of bread that was his purpose he went
[1:14:21] into the Hall of Fame yeah I can't a
[1:14:24] lunch and sharing his purpose was done
[1:14:32] you know you know more about it there
[1:14:34] later with the two mites
[1:14:38] that chance could not have been they
[1:14:41] waited time brother they waited I hope
[1:14:44] I'm not preaching but they waited let me
[1:14:47] stop right now
[1:14:50] this is anointing is up here you don't
[1:14:53] so I just trusted you see every one of
[1:14:55] us ought to have some real smiles on our
[1:14:57] faces Tech know that everything you go
[1:15:03] through is just for sins every season
[1:15:06] change let's pray we thank you Lord for
[1:15:12] your grace such a message to me Lord
[1:15:16] even your prophets said that one of
[1:15:18] these days they're coming a message it
[1:15:20] would be so simple if the people are not
[1:15:22] careful in the past right through them
[1:15:25] this a word this morning have not only
[1:15:28] just encouraged me but it has
[1:15:30] enlightened me Lord it has given me a
[1:15:33] greater sight it in the future and right
[1:15:38] now the present time I thank you for
[1:15:41] your lesson that you gave him given unto
[1:15:43] us today in the way that that it came
[1:15:46] about today soul it's that needed to be
[1:15:49] said he wanted to say it Lord and just
[1:15:51] learning them you just said what you
[1:15:54] needed to say Lord I'm so thankful I'm
[1:15:56] so grateful I pray that the people of
[1:15:59] God has been blessed this morning bless
[1:16:03] us now as we give honor to you in all
[1:16:07] things in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:16:11] amen just keep on praying for the Lord
[1:16:16] is not just keep on praying he'll hear
[1:16:23] your cry all the Lord has promised and
[1:16:28] His Word is true you may be seated
[1:16:31] does he fall prey
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:53] it was time brother without the boy and
[1:18:22] we rarely get snow down in South
[1:18:24] Carolina but I used to be so happy when
[1:18:27] it's no then because it meant I didn't
[1:18:30] have to go to school cuz we didn't go to
[1:18:34] school when it's no I don't care if it
[1:18:37] was one inch all the schools were shut
[1:18:40] down so when it with snow it was a
[1:18:44] blessing
[1:18:45] alright for me
[1:18:48] [Laughter]
[1:18:52] sometimes people think it's a blessing
[1:18:53] to stay home for church sometimes
[1:18:57] children think like that we're not going
[1:18:58] to jail good you know but they don't
[1:19:01] understand just like I didn't understand
[1:19:05] those days you wish you can call recall
[1:19:08] those days when you should have been in
[1:19:10] schooling there wasn't maybe you would
[1:19:12] have come out a little more smarter or
[1:19:14] something people don't know the
[1:19:18] sacrifice there's no way you can
[1:19:20] sacrifice then come the church and God
[1:19:24] not reward you personally I feel sorry
[1:19:27] for the ones who didn't make it today
[1:19:29] who could have been here but they missed
[1:19:33] their chance they missed the opportunity
[1:19:37] there's so many things I want to say and
[1:19:40] I can't because the brothers preaching
[1:19:41] but he got me stirred because I just
[1:19:45] don't want to be one of those ones when
[1:19:50] Jesus says when I was in jail you didn't
[1:19:54] visit me when I was hungry you didn't
[1:19:57] feed he couldn't have said that to them
[1:20:03] had not they had a chance to do so so he
[1:20:09] loved the Lord all hearts minds are
[1:20:13] clear you need a song okay okay that's
[1:20:19] Stan
[1:20:20] I'm grateful to the Lord because I know
[1:20:24] that all these trials that we're going
[1:20:26] through is an answer to your prayer you
[1:20:30] say Lord I want to be just like you yes
[1:20:35] and when we have spirits that God can't
[1:20:43] use when he gets ready to deliver or do
[1:20:46] whatever he needs to do he makes sure he
[1:20:47] get rid of all right before he could
[1:20:50] take them to the promised land he had to
[1:20:52] get rid of all of the Egyptians
[1:21:07] you can stop changes in our lives
[1:21:52] you understand me he said there will be
[1:21:55] a supernatural Rodman and we are special
[1:21:59] eraser I not settle for being just
[1:22:06] ordinary we're not we have been call as
[1:22:29] long as I characters still in the ditch
[1:23:26] you love the Lord
[1:23:39] because he's my salvation Oh God breathe
[1:24:02] it's true in closing if we think about
[1:24:10] the lives of the apostles in the
[1:24:12] province and think about how dedicated
[1:24:16] they were to the cause and the purpose
[1:24:19] they just didn't have time for the world
[1:24:22] and it had time for the things of the
[1:24:25] world they were busy about their
[1:24:28] father's business and I trust and pray
[1:24:31] that those of us who really believe that
[1:24:33] we are bribed that we have been called
[1:24:36] that we as our brothers asia's sit down
[1:24:39] and do inventory and look and see where
[1:24:42] God hands us and what he's been trying
[1:24:45] to get us to do and how many Figgis
[1:24:47] doesn't matter but now let it get on

[1:24:51] be weirdest miss
