verse nine did i say enough when you get there just say amen if you're having problems locating it just say help me lord the bible reads but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light our bibles to the book of jeremiah in chapter 1 verse 4 5 reads verses then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou came his foot out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations for a short time this morning i want to speak on this subject predestinated unto sons they put this they feast amen when we were reading in the book of jeremiah come on this is the word of the lord came unto me saying i knew thee before you were formed why because god had forced for knew him before he was even conceived amen he was on the back part of god's mind before the creation amen we did not come in here when we were created we were there before the foundation upon that amen in the book of uh ephesians chapter one and verse four don't leave it says according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world um that we should be holy and without blame before him in love unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so all the born please hear this then the prophet of god came and told us that he predestinated us before the foundation of the world [Music] being predestinated means being chosen or being pre-determined beforehand before any angel was created you weren't there and attributed remand and when you were given birth on this earth account of simone you were just being made manifested when you were doing whatever you were doing before you were when your because the word of god came and told us who we were pascular paul de jones and we know who we are and we saw your son predestinated sons and daughters of god destiny and we have the same attributes that our father nowadays we are living in a time where everyone is trying to trace their lineage people are going for dna tests they want to check where am i from they jeans on 25th they did test to dna there is a yearning in people's hearts there is a yearning in people's spirits to know where they came from amen people want to know how much percentage i'm from where we are a hundred percent sons of basketball and we a hundred percent came from heaven and that's where we are going back home amen amen so we see satan tries to come in i don't know everything people are trying to figure out their real identity trying to figure out where they came and from starts bringing confusion amongst the people people who were born men they start confusing themselves and say i'm a man who's in a woman's body because and people say i'm a woman who's in a man's body hey they found this kiss on they they found on don't don't call they're not people are confused they don't know who they are confusing south pakistan that's just the devil's streak to confuse people confusion i mean but we thank god for the message that came to clear our minds claire and that came to tell us that we are sons we are daughters of the old man amen the prophet tells us that we were elected by predestination and we were predestinated by full knowledge i know many people they they trip over this subject i've had conversations with people where they say why does god predestinate parliament you say they say god is unfair if he can choose you before he even created you he discovered he chose that i was going to go to hell before i was even born because he is god before the foundation of the world fascinated you avoid foundations he knew the choice you were going to make it he says i rejected esau because he knew before the foundation of the world's esau was going to sell his business amen amen so god is faith he predestinated us based by our choice god knew before the foundation of the world would be saved and who wouldn't person i volunteer it was not god's will for any man to be lost but it was predestination by for knowledge of what your choice was he saw every member put every name on the lamp's book of life before the church ever begin jesus came to seek and save that which was on that book jesus so your name was put in the lamp section of the book of life only leave or do do do do leave for the v and your name cannot be erased it cannot be removed amen so that ought to make you start rejoicing it doesn't matter how much you have sinned come here all you just have to do is repent amen amen we thank god for his mercy and grace we thank god for the message of the hour that came to open our eyes so we could know that we were sons and daughters of god you knew that your parents were were just objects that god used to bring you on this earth it doesn't matter if your parents were believed the word of god or not they could that's called the mercy basket amen when mercy locates you can't have misery it can do for you that no one else can do it jesus said it doesn't matter how how bad your sins are sincere deeper and poor can be able to vocation so even as they were as crimson memphis his blood can wash away all of them so some people laughing amen we all know of the the woman at the well lucifer that fam don't do donald don don't don't report she was known as a prostitute and they take conure coming from situations when god was seeing her in my country he was seeing a daughter of god what matters is what god sees it comes to come juvenile we all know of mary magdalene when she was watching her when she was watching watching jesus and the prophet says she had seven demons on her the prophet judy kate calavera set them on on it people were looking at her with distaste no one could go near her person because when they were looking at her they were senior prostitutes they were looking at a woman of ill fame is a reputation for reputation uh and he had seen her as a candidate as one of the people was supposed to receive the holy ghost but what happened in between did not matter [Applause] amen amen and the bible says jesus father all that you have given unto me i have lost none of them so you can never be lost god will go through thick and thin to come and catch you do you ever fail fools at pool come and rescue you because you are part of him basketball himself his attribute so nothing can stop him until you are saved okin because he has a purpose in your life pasquila and bridge you were not just born to live eat and die but he brought you on this earth for a purpose so he could shine his light through you is and the bible read of gideon and we know gideon was when the angel approached him he was actually being a coward [Music] eyelash he was hiding at the thrashing floor and he was not he was not being he was not being courageous but he was being a coward amen hiding those harvests from the media knights he returned to the garden but when the angel of the lord came down makon launched he did not address him to say you coward what he was amen amen the prophet of god says you know what i'm going to begin to think the prophet he says i'm not a fighter but i'm a son of abraham amen amen he was being called he was hiding he turned turned to that time last year at some point the prophet god says he was looking at his wife and his sons and his daughters and he saw they were getting thin [Music] i know that my god still lives israel come on do you think he has a crisis at hand he says and the spirit of the lord came upon him [Music] and he jumped out there in the middle of the road with an ox-god this is just a little stick have there come a button it is an and that little stick elevation he beat down and killed 600 philistines why because he knew that he was the son of god he knew that he was the predestinated son of god a man he had a right he stood at his god-given right he said and the prophet of god says you'll prophet to judy as any man that's been circumcised by the spirit of god [Music] amen amen that promise applies to us said promise are sons and daughters of abraham spiritual sons of god of abraham the feast spiritual the bible says whenever you are saved that makes you a a seed of abraham who says that's a death stroke to satan the prophet to judy can say say amen the word of god will overcome satan anywhere any place that's why the prophet saying the prophet all we have to do is believe this is amen we thank god for the victory we thank god for him opening our eyes for us amen because he knows satan knows the moment you understand that your victory is in the world like victoria is about to put he knows it's a done deal for him he's sick that's why he brings these distractions to us that's why he he makes sure we don't read our word make sure we don't listen to the tape effect because he knows the more we dig into that word the more we realize the need to stand in our position we see people nowadays the church is forgetting that they are predestinated sons and daughters of god people are trying to balance the word they say the amen what the word of god says that's enough circular power the judges say what the prophet of god says that is good enough for me circulate the prophet jesus someone who come and tell you that was 1965 that's outdated if the scripture that says by his stripes i was healed two more than two thousand years ago if it's done it works if it still works right now it still works today then you cannot come and tell me that what the prophet says is outdated do you call the prophet [Applause] it is meant for us amen so all you just have to do realize this satan the devil and his tricks the prophet god says the moment you realize it in the district that you have already overcome no survey pacquiao but god did major saving he said you are a beast slayer his father and his brothers they were seeing a little young boy who's supposed to be heading the ship but when he was out there mccoy god was preparing him to prepare for what he brought him onto this earth he was slowly positioning him into what he's supposed to do hey man that's why when he was begged that the the lion and the bear they came to try to steal the sheep hello if you read your bible carefully when he came to goliath a goal yet he didn't say david tipped toward toward goliath the bible does not say that david tipped toward to go to goliath the very thing that the whole host of israel was afraid of la la la sally israel david knew that the god that was with me back then with me today [Applause] amen amen so when you stand in your position what position [Applause] amen amen if he did it for david without who didn't have the holy ghost what about you bride of christ he's living with them and remember satan cannot touch you without god's permission there is no sickness that can come upon you unless god allows satan do you remember the story of job satan had to ask and god says go and touch him but don't live his life amen so that is to show us that there is nothing that ever happens to you unless god allows you to pass and if god allows it he has already seen you overcoming it without have you even connection because he has trusted you basketball confused he has trusted his son he has tried to stay his daughter just remember that god has allowed it to happen most importantly he knows you are going through it is going to overcome the prophet of god says now remember this the prophet of judicial or happily who christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts chris don't likely don't don't like donald trump like the continuation do you live for but the book of revelation shows how that that antichrist spirit will try to come in the church and defile it satan will try to make it to come in and make the church look warm and powerless i'm scared but we thank god for the word for the message exposes satan at all amen and we know that he will be cast out in the lake of fighters although he fights but he will not stand listen to this he says and he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what the true church is that's the whole reason why satan is fighting you see the moment you realize the revelation you get the revelations amen amen the prophet of god also says the prophet judy brother sister furniture that deity isn't you set set divinity of a little while the world seated me no more and i'm pretty tall among them yet you shall see me maybe how because jesus said the world would not see me basketball oh that was in christ was poured into the church i the other side all the power god had when he killed dude that prisons could you have it lose people from heaven the same power that was in jesus name and the same power that was in jesus was is in you and if god overcame satan and jesus overcame satanism that same power is also able to make you overcome amen amen so we gotta know and realize satan and all his tricks and voila but we know we can overcome that with the power that christ invested books that's what the book of revelation is the secular idea for the apocalypse amen amen the book of revelation says jesus is the king of kings which kings are they talking about i know they can't why so he says you and amen amen thank you lord i love this uh story that the prophet that the prophet tells us and he was walking then he saw this shiny object that was that was right there hey and the boy that when he smiles the little boy smiles back corner got and he ran off from there saying i've seen myself in the mirror that is me sassy and we thank god today for the mirror of the world after they're ready they they went back to the person who gave them a person take back your book it called me a buzzard person i wish i could help you he says i read this word he tells i read this book he told me that i'm a buzzer person and this brand you say say what he said the same book you're talking about call me an ego they were looking into the mirror if you are a scene of the bible just the word of god will just tell you who you are why because it was a woman who realized who she was reality she realized i'm a daughter of god if you read the whole story the prophet was not even praying for a prophet so that the picture in the image could get complete complex the picture in the mirror had to be completed the prophet of god uh he comes down he disembarks the plane perfect he starts walking he does not know where he's going he was just being told turn right turn that yeah he's interested to uh turn that watch directing him it doesn't matter what the situation is come here come on you're going to pray bring your swings into place and the prophet says i didn't even pray the prophet he told the lady to pray and after she prayed he just said thank you [Music] because god has a reputation of not failing repetition if you call him to his word he's gonna have to make it come to pass see who's passed when you are sick just call him on the word composite i was talking to brother isaac just the other day i have not to fight exactly there's a couple that does not attend this church they have visited this one day easy my wife has never conceived before my family and we just called god on his word and we prayed it was just a few months ago memphis in full school that is a sign like a cloud like a man's hand keep on holding on you're going to have that continue baby amen amen and even till now i believe i know that is going to happen amen because we are calling god and his word will you speak the word do not worry about it no because i'm not the one who's going to make the world come to pass basically if i am sick i'm not going to start stressing and say how am i going to get it my problem is just to say it is finished when how i'm going to be here i'll leave it up to god you don't have jewelry because i know he will do it that's because he by reference so i can call so nothing can stand in your way hello hallelujah hallelujah the prophet god says the prophet to judy oh that was in god he brought into christ and all that was in christ he brought into the church you know if you go to to uh if you go to the sea i don't know and you take sea water and you put it in a bottle you can come back here to iowa where we don't have cng so i have sea water although it's in a bottle you can call it sea water because the thing that makes it sea water it's not the container continuously but it's the properties of the water that's inside appropriated even if i change it and put it into another container message also not continue not bootay i can still call it seawater because the container has nothing to do with what the water is so if the spirit that was in god came into christ and that same spirit came into you it's just a different vessel but that same spirit is the exact same thing mercedes-benz shows amen amen so god if you just allow him to work through you hello again what he did on the shores of galilee he can do through a son and a daughter of god confessing feed the jew the bible also says we were made amateur gods that's john 10 34. jesus answered them and said is it not written in your law jesus i said you are god was that the jew if he called them gods and to whom the world the word of god came see why because it's god himself that is in you and me or more so i can say i'm a god because god is in allah you are a daughter of god was that not feast was that true in february you're the foundation of the world i found that the prophet god talks about the eagle of the story of the uh eagle the prophet of jupiter is while the leg with the ego that laid it's it's it's eggs and the farmer went to take one of the uh one of one of the eagles eggs and put it under a chicken only don't don't leave not a bad school and with this she can uh hatch these ads is is is it the little igloo came out looking funny although it was born amongst chickens it was not a chicken to begin with he said take long i think they don't really donate when they were eating all those chicken food it was nasty to it when your friends trying to to show you things of the world to make you do those things on the moon they say they will fail fair the shoes to surmount even out of even when you are out of line ma'am conversates underlying amen but we thank god when the message came forth when the message mama eagle came forth calling you and me was if you knew who's happiness you had to leave all the things you were doing i was predestinated nothing that you can do can turn you can remove you on your path but your destiny is already set by destiny and victory is yours for certain if you just stand on that word no matter how much satan tries to pull you away [Applause] just stand from and you say i'm a son of god
