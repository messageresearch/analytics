[33:46] amen let's just as we stand we'll open
[33:50] in our Bible to Genesis chapter 1
[34:01] Genesis chapter 1 will read the eleventh
[34:04] verse in 12th verse and from there we'll
[34:09] go to Matthew chapter 24 and it says and
[34:16] God said let the earth bring forth grass
[34:19] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[34:23] tree yielding fruit after his kind whose
[34:26] seed is in itself upon the earth and it
[34:30] was so and the earth brought forth grass
[34:33] and herb yielding seed after his kind
[34:35] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[34:39] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[34:42] that it was good
[34:45] hey man let's turn over to Matthew
[34:48] chapter 24
[34:56] I want to speak a message called the
[34:58] power of the seed Matthew 24 verse 32 it
[35:13] says now learn a parable of the fig tree
[35:16] when his branch is yet tender and
[35:19] putteth forth his leaves you know that
[35:22] summer is nigh so likewise ye when you
[35:25] shall see all these things know that it
[35:28] is near even at the doors verily I say
[35:31] unto you this generation shall not pass
[35:34] till all these things be fulfilled
[35:37] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[35:40] words shall not pass away
[35:43] Amen let's bow our heads in a word of
[35:45] Prayer Heavenly Father we just approach
[35:47] unto you again this morning thanking you
[35:49] Lord for bringing us into this place
[35:51] safely Lord and soundly Lord I pray Lord
[35:54] as you've gathered the people here -
[35:56] this morning Lord that you also would
[35:58] see to it father they'd be fed Lord by
[36:00] your word just like when the three
[36:03] thousand or the five thousand gathered
[36:04] themselves together Lord you saw to it
[36:06] that they were fed Lord by bread that
[36:09] you provided Lord and so the same thing
[36:11] today Lord that we've gathered together
[36:13] in this room Lord Lord to be fed upon
[36:15] the Word of God and Lord we pray Lord
[36:18] that as as I preach this gospel Lord
[36:21] that there would not be my words Laura
[36:23] but yours alone father for only you are
[36:25] able to inspire Lord of the words of
[36:28] life father and Lord so we just submit
[36:30] ourselves the years of the hear and the
[36:33] mouth of the speaker we just submit
[36:35] ourselves to you right now in the name
[36:37] of Lord Jesus Christ knowing that you
[36:40] will see to it Lord that the people will
[36:42] be fed by your glory and by your gospel
[36:43] and the name of Jesus Christ we thank
[36:46] you lord amen
[36:48] hey man you can be seated Amen you is
[36:53] familiar with scriptures
[36:57] you know brother branham had a lot to
[36:59] say about the Word of God being a seat
[37:03] Amen he preached about it very
[37:05] frequently you know he had he preached
[37:08] that message of the spoken word of God
[37:11] is the original seat amen and I actually
[37:15] I have the book of that and I keep that
[37:17] by my table because it is a it's just
[37:20] one of my favorite sermons I just I love
[37:23] to read it frequently and I'll just pick
[37:25] it up and read glanced through it and
[37:27] read it through it quite a bit but one
[37:30] of the things that he said in that and
[37:32] that in that book is that the Word of
[37:36] God as a seat it is a seed that will
[37:39] bring forth of its kind you cannot stop
[37:41] it it is when God plants a seed he puts
[37:44] the DNA on the inside and God knows that
[37:47] when he plants a seed that whatever he
[37:50] put on the inside of the seed he has the
[37:53] same faith that a farmer has that went
[37:55] then it'll come up exactly what he
[37:57] plants you know when a farmer is
[38:00] planting his crops for the year he yeah
[38:02] he does it in complete faith that the
[38:05] type of seed that he purchased that he
[38:07] bought that that is the type of seed
[38:09] they'll come up out of the ground
[38:11] he doesn't doubt he doesn't worry you
[38:13] know I know there are the many people
[38:15] that if they were gonna say for
[38:17] retirement or something like that if
[38:18] they went and they took their their
[38:20] paper cash and put it down in the ground
[38:23] they'd have a lot to worry about amen
[38:25] because you know if they think that the
[38:27] water was gonna ruin it that the the
[38:29] paper would disintegrate and and after a
[38:32] while that if you went to go dig it up
[38:34] nine months later that he wouldn't find
[38:37] why he had buried it wouldn't be in the
[38:39] same condition amen and almost nobody if
[38:42] they had something really valuable would
[38:44] trust it to put it down in the dirt of
[38:46] the earth and expect that after nine
[38:49] months of rain and and frost and
[38:51] whatever it might be that after so much
[38:54] time that that if they could go and dig
[38:57] it back up out of the ground they would
[38:58] actually be worth more than when they
[39:01] put it in the ground almost nobody
[39:03] expects to see that but God is a little
[39:06] bit different than mankind Amen God has
[39:09] ways that are higher than man
[39:11] man's ways amen and he knows that when
[39:14] he puts his word in something that it
[39:16] cannot fail to come to pass
[39:18] Amen nothing can stop it Amen so what he
[39:21] do is he put his word in the seat and he
[39:24] sealed it as a as a sign forever that
[39:27] God's Word would bring forth of its own
[39:30] kind amen when God puts something down
[39:33] on the inside of a seat he knows that
[39:35] the generation after generation after
[39:37] generation as long as no one tampers
[39:40] with that seat
[39:41] it'll continue to bring you forth of his
[39:42] kind continue bringing forth of its kind
[39:45] amen he knows how in the last day where
[39:47] the attack come they came to a hybrid
[39:49] the seats that's what they the last day
[39:53] anointing of the devil was to come and
[39:56] attack the seats amen so you see back in
[40:00] the nineteen teens in the 1920s every
[40:03] farmer when he when he sowed his crops
[40:07] he would save his seeds over for the
[40:10] next year but then in the 1930s they
[40:13] discovered ways to hybrid seeds to bring
[40:16] forth better-looking plants that would
[40:18] look a little bit better amen and in the
[40:21] course of just a few short years
[40:23] probably no more than a decade that this
[40:26] country our country went from almost 90%
[40:30] of the farmers saving their seats to the
[40:32] next year at the beginning of 1932 when
[40:35] he got to 1940 probably as more like 90%
[40:38] of the farmers are now having to
[40:40] purchase their seeds for the next year
[40:43] because they are completely in the short
[40:45] period of time in about a ten year span
[40:47] of time that the farmers switched over
[40:49] almost wholly from 10% of the farmers
[40:52] using hybrids to 90% it was it was a
[40:55] very quick changeover and I would like
[40:58] to think about it this way right now
[41:00] that if we were to have to go back to
[41:04] using saving seats
[41:07] how many genuine seeds are left on the
[41:10] earth they have not been tampered with
[41:13] where are they we have taken hybrid
[41:17] seeds and spread them all over the world
[41:20] to the point now that that if we were
[41:22] forced to go back and try to
[41:24] find a seed that was a right in its
[41:27] generations you couldn't find it you
[41:31] couldn't find it
[41:32] amen you know it's just every seed has
[41:35] been tampered with to the point that how
[41:37] can they bring back forth of its same
[41:39] kind like God said they can't because
[41:41] they hybrid the seat I mean how can you
[41:44] find a you know late like if you go to
[41:46] the Living History Farms they have this
[41:47] plot of corn they say this is what corn
[41:50] looked like in the 1600s this is what I
[41:53] looked like in the 1900s there's what
[41:54] looked like the 1930 this is what looks
[41:56] like today and you see his progression
[41:58] of what corn looked like it went from
[42:00] being a bush you know 100 200 years ago
[42:03] to be in this one simple stock you know
[42:06] it's has completely changed
[42:08] why because man has tampered with what
[42:12] God now God originally said this is what
[42:15] corn is supposed to look like the man
[42:17] comes along and says this is what I
[42:19] think corn should look like and we can
[42:21] make it look better to feed more people
[42:23] he meant but God put his original in the
[42:27] beginning and there's this something
[42:29] about seeing something that is original
[42:31] a mint then it's the way that God
[42:35] intended for it to be God when God
[42:37] designs something and he designs it to
[42:40] be original then when you see that it's
[42:43] like mine like if you ever see a real
[42:46] Christian it does something to you you
[42:49] know if you you know I think a lot about
[42:51] the the Pentecostal movement you know
[42:54] like I grew up in Pentecostal movements
[42:56] and there is so much about they want to
[43:01] see a constant outpouring of the Holy
[43:03] Ghost constant constant constant to
[43:05] where it's a Holy Ghost movement every
[43:07] day of the week always over the
[43:09] congregation and I was what would that
[43:10] do what would that cause amongst the
[43:12] people it caused a pride to rise up
[43:15] every time every time a revival strikes
[43:18] a church it usually ends up with a
[43:21] moment a time of pride where they begin
[43:23] to rise look what we have done look at
[43:25] how at the the we prayed enough to have
[43:29] a revival Amen we we worked hard enough
[43:32] to to get this revival you know we did
[43:35] this or we did that and always up and it
[43:38] rival dies off and why is it God sent
[43:42] his spirit into the congregation and
[43:45] wanted to do it brought forth every seed
[43:48] that was planted in that congregation
[43:50] now they rejoice because the Holy Spirit
[43:53] is there in power but what they don't
[43:56] realize is actually the word went before
[43:58] the revival amen and also the Satan went
[44:02] forth with his word before the revival
[44:04] and two seeds were sowed in their church
[44:07] and maybe they didn't quite realize
[44:09] because he was a quiet time when the
[44:11] seeds were being sown and maybe they
[44:13] didn't realize it but then when the Holy
[44:15] Ghost comes they rejoice they shout they
[44:17] sing they dance they speak in tongues
[44:20] they need to do all those things and not
[44:22] realize that all that is happening is
[44:24] the Holy Spirit is just watering the
[44:26] seeds that were accepted before good and
[44:29] every seed begins to bring forth exactly
[44:32] the DNA of what was accepted in the
[44:35] meantime now for those that accepted the
[44:37] Word of God and his purity when the Holy
[44:39] Spirit comes it brings up in us that man
[44:42] starts growing and he starts growing and
[44:44] he accepts and he's he's just he's
[44:46] growing the Word of God amen but for the
[44:49] church that that constantly mixes this
[44:52] with the word and this with the word and
[44:54] this with the word when the Holy Ghost
[44:56] that church can receive a revival but
[44:59] when the revival does come what grows
[45:03] only the seed that is planted is what
[45:06] growth came and that is why it is
[45:08] important amen here like right here in
[45:11] this church we're in a quiet time they
[45:13] meant we haven't had a revival for a
[45:15] while I believe we're due for a revival
[45:17] payment we're due for a revival amen
[45:20] what are we doing though we're you know
[45:23] brother Branham he talked about the the
[45:25] the teaching rain the former rain in the
[45:27] latter ring Amen if you grew up in
[45:30] Pentecost you
[45:31] you hear that preach on over and over
[45:34] and over again talking preaching on the
[45:36] latter rain the latter rain and every
[45:38] every Holy Spirit outpouring there is
[45:41] they they preach about the latter rain
[45:43] amen why because the latter rain was to
[45:46] bring a power and a might and something
[45:49] that they could they could take
[45:51] Angele grab ahold of something they
[45:53] could enjoy something they could have
[45:55] something that they could use and
[45:58] sometimes used to lift their own selves
[46:01] up amen amen but but brother branham's
[46:05] were right in the middle of of the
[46:08] all-powerful latter rain movement Butler
[46:11] bram got up and started preaching you
[46:13] know you folks say that we're in the
[46:15] latter rain he says we're not we are in
[46:17] the former rain there's a you know
[46:20] brother Graham he had a lot of things
[46:21] that he did like that has like when
[46:22] right in the 1962 during the Cuban
[46:25] Missile Crisis buh-bam says don't fear
[46:28] communism you know and here everybody is
[46:32] looking at you know the Russians are
[46:33] putting nuclear bombs 90 miles from
[46:35] Florida you know all these things all
[46:37] these things that they're worrying about
[46:38] you know and and we're a prophet stands
[46:40] up and says don't worry about that worry
[46:43] about Romanism and now you can't get
[46:45] anybody to worry about communism you
[46:48] know now you can't now that now that
[46:50] people will welcome communism a man you
[46:52] can't gain way to fear it but just 50
[46:54] years ago everybody was afraid of it but
[46:56] her prophets it up in the midst of that
[46:57] fear and said don't worry about
[47:00] communism worry about Romanism Amen
[47:03] likewise today who's worrying about
[47:05] rheumatism no-one's worrying about
[47:08] Romanism Amen but brother Brown said
[47:11] that one of these days in the last days
[47:13] that as soon as the latter rain does
[47:16] come it'll just bring a persecution on
[47:20] the bride amen they will bind themselves
[47:23] together tightly which they're hardly
[47:25] done amen and then what happens you know
[47:28] when brother when when Jesus preached
[47:30] about the parable of the tares he said
[47:35] that there was two seats sowed in one
[47:38] field
[47:39] amen and when the in came they bind the
[47:45] they bound the tares together tightly
[47:47] amen and they were bound together pretty
[47:50] tight I mean what nowhere where what
[47:54] happens when the terrorists were bound
[47:56] together the wheat is standing alone
[47:58] amen it'll look like we have no place in
[48:02] the church you know and that's when
[48:03] Butler Brown says that's when there will
[48:05] be a
[48:05] boycott why they're standing alone amen
[48:08] the Bride of Christ stands alone
[48:10] what is she standing upon the Word of
[48:13] God that she received amen she received
[48:16] a word now as we said there and we read
[48:18] there and Jesus said every word amen
[48:22] he said heaven and earth shall pass away
[48:25] but my words shall not pass away he met
[48:29] said there in verse three before verily
[48:31] I say to you this generation shall not
[48:33] pass till all these things be fulfilled
[48:36] one thing that brother Graham stressed
[48:38] is every word must be fulfilled before
[48:42] the in comes every word has to be
[48:45] fulfilled amen so when you own you you
[48:47] when there's like you see the scriptures
[48:49] like there's a the Bride of Christ it'll
[48:51] be without spot or wrinkle that brought
[48:53] that that scripture has to be fulfilled
[48:56] it cannot fail amen so what are we doing
[49:00] we are storing up that word down on the
[49:02] inside of us because we know that seeds
[49:04] going to grow that seed is growing it's
[49:07] growing it's growing
[49:07] amen and it's going to what are we doing
[49:09] so while everybody else is planting
[49:12] various different hybrid seeds in their
[49:14] hearts amen we here are gathering the
[49:17] other seeds in our hearts that are from
[49:19] the Word of God amen that's why we
[49:22] listen to the tapes that's why we listen
[49:24] to the messages why because in this last
[49:26] day God sent us a message sent us a
[49:29] prophet a man what did that prophet do
[49:31] he says everybody thinks that we're in
[49:33] the latter rain we're in the former ring
[49:35] amen and right now as a teaching rain
[49:38] the cheechee is going out it's the Word
[49:40] of God he said Billy Graham is preaching
[49:43] his words amen
[49:45] Oral Roberts preaching his over here and
[49:47] I am preaching my message here for the
[49:49] bride they will receive it amen and all
[49:52] those words will bring forth exactly of
[49:55] their own kinds amen
[50:04] amen remember Amos 3:7 God says I will
[50:07] do nothing but what I show it to my
[50:09] servants the prophets first amen now now
[50:13] brother Brown was thoroughly vindicated
[50:15] amen amen when every time I hear one of
[50:18] those healing lights or I see one of
[50:20] those I see the Messiah signing action
[50:22] you know when when when when I when I
[50:25] see or when I hear brother Branham on
[50:26] the tape saying I'm gonna turn my back
[50:28] to the audience and he starts discerning
[50:31] the thoughts of the people and the
[50:32] prayers of the people with his back
[50:34] turned audience do you realize that he
[50:36] is recreating the same situation that
[50:38] happened in the time of Abraham in
[50:42] Genesis that he is recreating that scene
[50:45] over again amen where where he had his
[50:48] back to the tent behind him amen
[50:53] why is Sarah laughing in the tent behind
[50:55] him he's recreating that what did we see
[50:59] in our day and sometimes I wonder if we
[51:01] realized the met the power of this
[51:02] message that we've been giving us and
[51:04] how we ought to get these seeds down on
[51:07] the inside and receive them a member if
[51:09] we never listen to the messages how can
[51:12] we receive the seeds that were preached
[51:15] amen why because there will be a lot of
[51:18] rain and what will it do it will
[51:20] manifest everything that was sowed in
[51:22] your heart amen every seed that you
[51:25] brought forth into your heart will be
[51:27] manifested everything that you allowed
[51:31] into your spirit of your mind now
[51:33] remember how do seeds get in first first
[51:35] the seed has to come in through years a
[51:38] man through one of your senses a man it
[51:41] comes across the field of your mind and
[51:44] then you have a choice of accepting it
[51:46] or rejecting it amen and just like Mary
[51:49] every time you receive a seat when you
[51:52] hear the preaching of the gospel you
[51:54] consider your mind will you read your
[51:56] Bible when you're read when you're
[51:57] listening to a tape and you hear
[51:59] something it comes across the field of
[52:00] your mind you have to tell you have to
[52:02] tell yourself how much glory and honor
[52:04] am I going to give unto what I'm hearing
[52:06] amen how much preeminence in my life am
[52:09] I going to give to what I am hearing
[52:10] amen am I actually going to follow or
[52:13] listen to what I'm hearing or am I going
[52:15] to reject what I'm hearing
[52:16] amen
[52:17] every person has to make their choice
[52:19] amen every person has to make their
[52:22] choice what they will do with the Word
[52:26] of God that has been sent
[52:32] because when the Holy Spirit falls he
[52:34] only manifests what has been sown amen
[52:38] the Holy Spirit when it comes when the
[52:40] Holy Spirit comes and when he starts
[52:42] falling upon the church he's not there
[52:44] to bring the seed no the seed was
[52:46] already brought he's there to manifest
[52:47] the seeds that were already sown amen
[52:51] and all of us have received seeds amen
[52:55] and they will grow and bring forth after
[52:57] the kind of what their so if we are a
[53:00] doubter of the word then we know what
[53:03] seeds will manifest amen aim as black
[53:07] brother Brown says if you if you say you
[53:09] believe something but you are a but
[53:11] yours but your thinking your mind no
[53:13] I'll go figure it out later I don't know
[53:15] if that's true he says you better stop
[53:16] that he says you better make it settled
[53:19] make it sure now why because what you're
[53:21] doing is is you're not actually laying
[53:23] the seeds coming into your heart or your
[53:25] align a mixed crop coming to your heart
[53:27] amen and that will manifest itself Amen
[53:30] what else what will manifest itself
[53:32] doubt unbelief unsure there won't be any
[53:38] faith there amen it'll be nothing in
[53:40] there but there will be nothing in there
[53:43] where the Word of God can actually take
[53:44] root and grow in your heart amen amen
[53:51] let's go over to Deuteronomy chapter 11
[54:27] we'll start with the seventh verse but
[54:34] your eyes have seen all the great acts
[54:36] of the Lord which he did therefore shall
[54:40] you keep all the commandments which I
[54:42] command you this day that you may be
[54:44] strong and go in and possess the land
[54:47] where you go to possess it amen so and
[54:50] what Moses is saying here is your eyes
[54:52] saw the axe your eyes saw what God did
[54:56] your eyes were joint you saw how God
[55:00] came into the congregation amen he did
[55:02] things that were mighty in power your
[55:04] eyes saw of this amen now because your
[55:08] eyes have seen this that I want you to
[55:10] believe all the words that I brought you
[55:13] unto you to believe amen
[55:15] so if you're if you have seen the if you
[55:19] ever once see the acts of the Lord in
[55:21] the congregation if you ever once see
[55:24] the power of God coming upon the people
[55:26] if you ever once see God doing something
[55:29] in your life doing something that you
[55:31] couldn't do yourself I mean if you ever
[55:33] seek once see the hand of God reaching
[55:35] down into the affairs of men that there
[55:39] is a sign unto you amen but signs do not
[55:43] save you amen if you ever once see the
[55:48] hand of God reaching down from heaven
[55:50] and interfering with the affairs of men
[55:53] whether it be through healing someone or
[55:55] delivering someone or just saving you
[55:58] from your sins well there beyond the
[56:00] tape and back in brother brems day or
[56:01] here in your day if you ever once
[56:03] witness God doing something then that
[56:06] there is a sign to you amen is a sign to
[56:10] you to believe the word amen
[56:14] once you got when God shows you a sign
[56:17] it expects you to receive that sign and
[56:20] believe forever amen
[56:23] once you see a sign of God you are to
[56:27] latch onto that sign amen
[56:29] if it be a true sign of God you were to
[56:31] latch onto that sign and believe forever
[56:33] why because you've seen God in action
[56:35] you no longer have the ability to say
[56:39] well I God never revealed himself to me
[56:41] you know God like that the Red Sea God
[56:45] revealed himself to the people at the
[56:47] Red Sea God revealed himself to the
[56:50] people of Mount Sinai amen so that when
[56:52] they got to Kadesh Barnea they were to
[56:55] refer back to the power of the sign that
[56:57] went before them amen and you used that
[57:00] as strength to go forward and say I know
[57:02] the same God that was a witness to me
[57:05] back there the same God as sit with me
[57:08] and he'll lead me on through all the way
[57:10] amen and so is it the the bride has
[57:13] received her sign of brother Branham
[57:16] amen
[57:16] she she listened to the tapes amen she's
[57:19] received that sign then she used to go
[57:22] forth nest sign and believe so when she
[57:24] comes into entering into the promises
[57:26] she's supposed to march for I know the
[57:28] same God that was with brother Branham
[57:30] will be with me now Amy I know the same
[57:32] God that was there doing these mighty
[57:34] acts back in the 1950s 1960s Amy I know
[57:37] that that same God is right here he's
[57:39] the same yesterday today and forever
[57:41] he's still alive he still remains God
[57:44] amen amen and he we're supposed to
[57:46] believe that sign in March forward into
[57:48] all the promises of God amen let's keep
[57:58] going on Deuteronomy 11 there verse a
[58:01] says therefore show you keep all the
[58:03] commandments which I command you this
[58:05] day why so that you may be strong and go
[58:09] in and possess the land whether you go
[58:12] to possess it and then you may prolong
[58:13] your days in the land which the Lord
[58:16] swear unto your father's to give unto
[58:18] them and to their seed a land flowing
[58:20] with milk and honey Amen you know there
[58:23] is supposed to be a bride in this day
[58:24] that is living comfortably in the
[58:25] promised land
[58:27] amen what is the promised land it's the
[58:30] land of the Holy Ghost it's the Holy
[58:32] Ghost in her life day in day out day in
[58:35] day out
[58:36] amen amen now God has a lot to say about
[58:39] this promised land amen now they were
[58:41] supposed to enter into this promised
[58:43] land and live there and be at peace amen
[58:45] they're supposed to bring their tithes
[58:47] and offering to the word those dalorto
[58:48] hey when they were supposed to go down
[58:50] and bring their sacrifice to the
[58:52] tabernacle a man they're supposed to do
[58:55] too
[58:55] receive the word from the priests amen
[58:58] they're supposed to have the slain lamb
[58:59] amen receive forgiveness of their sins
[59:01] they're supposed to frequently go back
[59:04] to the slain lamb over and over and over
[59:06] again they're supposed to have a slain
[59:08] lamb in the in the morning and evening
[59:10] every day a man and constantly referring
[59:13] back to the lamb those slain before the
[59:14] foundation of the world they're supposed
[59:15] to live at comfort in their promised
[59:18] land where all the promises of God are
[59:21] activated amen so how about you amen
[59:26] do you see the promises of God that
[59:28] manifested in your life are you are you
[59:31] abiding in him if you if you love me
[59:33] keep my Commandments amen if my if my
[59:37] word if if you're if my word abide in
[59:40] you amen you ask what you will and it
[59:44] shall be done to you that's the promised
[59:46] land that's the promised land of the
[59:48] most I got amen it's a land that's
[59:50] flowing with milk and honey
[59:55] amen verse 10 he's going on further to
[59:57] describe the land he says for the land
[1:00:00] where you go us and possess it is not as
[1:00:03] the land of Egypt it's not like the land
[1:00:06] of Egypt from where you came out of
[1:00:08] where thou sow a seed and that water sit
[1:00:12] with thy foot as a garden of herbs now
[1:00:16] what is sowing your seed and watering
[1:00:19] with your foot he's talked about
[1:00:21] irrigation back in Egypt it's a dry land
[1:00:25] amen and so they would take the water
[1:00:27] from the river and they irrigate it they
[1:00:29] draw trenches with their feet
[1:00:31] amen they let the water flow along their
[1:00:33] own man-made riches and they'd have
[1:00:35] their channels going so there they could
[1:00:38] have an irrigated garden that they
[1:00:39] themselves made and created amen but but
[1:00:43] the lore is saying this land that you're
[1:00:44] going into is not like that
[1:00:46] Amen you don't have control of when the
[1:00:49] rain is going to come amen
[1:00:51] for the land where thou ghost sent
[1:00:53] possess it verse 10 is not as the land
[1:00:55] of Egypt from winst out you came out of
[1:00:57] where thy was so slight foot and water
[1:00:59] sit with thy foot as the garden of herbs
[1:01:02] but the land whether you you going to
[1:01:05] possess it is a land of hills and
[1:01:06] valleys and drinketh the wall
[1:01:09] of the rain of heaven amen not some
[1:01:12] polluted river somewhere no it doesn't
[1:01:15] get the you're not gonna the gardens
[1:01:17] that are here in the promised land
[1:01:18] they're not like the irrigation of Egypt
[1:01:21] you're not taking the land of the of the
[1:01:23] polluted Nile of where they they do all
[1:01:25] their cleaning all their sewage and all
[1:01:27] that no no but the land the promised
[1:01:30] lands a little bit different it drinks
[1:01:32] from the water of heaven amen amen so if
[1:01:36] you ever get to a place where you're
[1:01:37] running out or rain you can't go out and
[1:01:40] work for it you can only look up to the
[1:01:42] heavens and trust God for it amen in
[1:01:47] order to be in the promised land they
[1:01:49] had to put themselves at the mercy of
[1:01:50] the most I got a mint and if God didn't
[1:01:55] send them rain they were gonna die and
[1:01:56] there's nothing they could do about it
[1:01:57] they had to trust and the most I got
[1:02:02] verse 11 but the land whether the hell
[1:02:05] you go to possess it is a land of hills
[1:02:08] and valleys and drink it's the water of
[1:02:10] the rain of heaven and the land which
[1:02:13] the LORD thy God care it's a land which
[1:02:15] the LORD thy God cares for the eyes of
[1:02:19] the Lord thy God are always upon it from
[1:02:21] the beginning of the year even unto the
[1:02:23] end of the year you know I think I would
[1:02:28] rather have that land than any other
[1:02:30] land amen why now if you are a man of
[1:02:35] faith then you would prefer the land the
[1:02:39] promised land
[1:02:39] amen but if your amantha is maybe on the
[1:02:44] borderline or a half faith and half
[1:02:46] doubt then you would prefer the land of
[1:02:48] egypt because then you'd have some
[1:02:50] manner of control about whether you're
[1:02:51] gonna have rain or not have rain a man
[1:02:55] you were how we were preaching on tithes
[1:02:58] and offerings a while back about how
[1:03:00] about how wait there's something about
[1:03:02] abraham when he met milk his attack that
[1:03:05] caused him to pay his tidy amen and then
[1:03:07] we went from there over to the rich
[1:03:12] young ruler amen now the rich young
[1:03:15] ruler when he went to up to the Lord
[1:03:18] Jesus he came running the Bible says he
[1:03:21] came running up to the Lord
[1:03:23] Jesus and bowing down and worshiping him
[1:03:27] it sounds like a good church service
[1:03:30] amen he came running to the Lord Jesus
[1:03:33] and bowed down and worshiped him and
[1:03:36] then said oh good master well that
[1:03:39] sounds like a great altar call it sounds
[1:03:42] like we could really get somewhere with
[1:03:43] someone like this amen
[1:03:45] but when he going to go say good master
[1:03:48] he said oh I want eternal life this
[1:03:52] sounds like a really good altar call
[1:03:53] we're having a church service here but
[1:03:56] then when Jesus he's like Jesus starts
[1:03:59] talking to him and begins to he came to
[1:04:02] the word he asked the word a question
[1:04:04] what must I do to inherit eternal life
[1:04:07] what do I have to do and what the word
[1:04:10] dude the word started discerning his
[1:04:12] life
[1:04:12] I started going down into the inside he
[1:04:16] asks the question ask the word a
[1:04:18] question now the word is going to
[1:04:20] respond the word is gonna find out where
[1:04:22] the trouble is amen where the trouble is
[1:04:24] and what happened the Word of God found
[1:04:27] the trouble first the word he's starting
[1:04:29] to scissor knee says well just obey the
[1:04:31] commandments he oh and the man says oh I
[1:04:34] begins to begin to brag about himself a
[1:04:36] little bit I have obeyed all the
[1:04:39] commandments since I was just a little
[1:04:41] boy
[1:04:41] I have always done exactly what the Ten
[1:04:43] Commandment said I I didn't want to lie
[1:04:45] I didn't wanna cheat I didn't want to
[1:04:47] steal I didn't murder I did everything I
[1:04:49] was supposed to do and now the word is
[1:04:51] beginning to Zurn this man is this man
[1:04:54] as perfect as he says or not and he's
[1:04:56] like oh there's one thing that you're
[1:04:59] lacking there's one thing that is
[1:05:03] preventing you from getting this eternal
[1:05:05] life that you're here at the altar of
[1:05:06] seeking for a man what he wouldn't
[1:05:09] forsake all the one thing that he was
[1:05:13] lacking was he wouldn't forsake all he
[1:05:17] said Jesus told so Jesus had the answer
[1:05:20] for payment he said go sell all that
[1:05:24] you'll have all that you have then
[1:05:26] you'll have treasure in heaven then come
[1:05:28] back and follow me and he says Oh
[1:05:34] oh no I know I can't I he wanted the
[1:05:39] Lord to give him something that he could
[1:05:41] do he wanted to break to the Lord about
[1:05:43] how perfect he was but then he found out
[1:05:45] that even though he was a child of
[1:05:47] Abraham even though he's living in the
[1:05:49] in the land of Abraham and here he's
[1:05:51] coming up to the point and Messiah be it
[1:05:55] for all of that
[1:05:57] he couldn't do the same thing Abraham
[1:05:59] did because Abraham when Abraham came
[1:06:02] before Melchizedek he forsook all but
[1:06:06] here the rich young ruler is coming
[1:06:07] before the same milk as that Lord Jesus
[1:06:09] Christ and he can't forsake all so here
[1:06:13] he is a Jew of son of Abraham in the
[1:06:16] promised land declaring that he can't do
[1:06:19] the same thing Abraham did so he's not a
[1:06:21] son of Abraham he testified against
[1:06:24] himself amen
[1:06:26] and then the Lord went to another man by
[1:06:28] the name of Zacchaeus and I found him up
[1:06:30] on a tree and he said now is that kiyose
[1:06:32] was also a son of Abraham amen and he
[1:06:35] comes and sees a kiss-up from the tree
[1:06:37] and he says come down out of that tree I
[1:06:39] must sup with you this night a many and
[1:06:42] Jesus enters into Zacchaeus house and
[1:06:44] Zacchaeus begins to prove that he's a
[1:06:47] son of Abraham why he says Oh Lord the
[1:06:50] half that I give I sell and I give to
[1:06:52] the poor he says Lord if I've wronged
[1:06:54] anybody I restore to him fourfold he's
[1:06:57] being a showing he's a son of Abraham
[1:06:58] he's forsaking all a menu and here the
[1:07:02] Lord wanted the rich young ruler to give
[1:07:04] up everything was that kiyose only had
[1:07:07] to give up half and the difference is is
[1:07:11] that kiyose had already given up
[1:07:12] everything in his heart
[1:07:14] amen amen
[1:07:18] in order to receive the seed you must
[1:07:22] have good ground amen now we can cry for
[1:07:27] a revival we can we can jump up and down
[1:07:30] we can drag out the trenches and try to
[1:07:33] make a well watered irrigated garden and
[1:07:35] all that but ultimately the rain has to
[1:07:37] come from the Most High God and if the
[1:07:40] Holy Spirit rain ever does come it only
[1:07:42] comes to water the seed that was planted
[1:07:45] amen and if you and
[1:07:48] seed of God will only grow in good
[1:07:50] ground and good ground is a land that
[1:07:54] has forsaken all the rocks all the hard
[1:07:57] places a man's broken up the follow
[1:08:00] grant fallow grant it's it's it's broken
[1:08:03] up all the unbroken ground amen
[1:08:06] and what's doing it's made itself ready
[1:08:09] to receive the seed amen this land isn't
[1:08:12] like the land of Egypt but it's a land
[1:08:14] that God watches though the eye of the
[1:08:16] Lord watches over continuously always
[1:08:19] Amen it's a prepared ground land flowing
[1:08:21] with milk and honey if you will enter
[1:08:23] into it amen amen
[1:08:31] you know I think about Joshua and Caleb
[1:08:35] you know when we read there in Matthew
[1:08:37] chapter 25
[1:08:44] the tears were bound together and the
[1:08:49] wheat stood alone amen you know it's
[1:08:51] hard to stand alone sometimes Amen you
[1:08:55] know it sometimes it would seem easier
[1:08:57] to join in with the tears amen and every
[1:09:00] person will have a situation in her life
[1:09:02] where it would seem easier to join in
[1:09:05] with the cares of this life or the
[1:09:07] things of this life rather than standing
[1:09:09] alone for God amen but a but a good
[1:09:12] ground jesus said the good ground would
[1:09:15] bring forth one hundredfold a man why
[1:09:17] because when the seed would fall upon it
[1:09:20] amen it could it could reproduce itself
[1:09:22] over the entire ground amen amen why
[1:09:27] because God is going to send the rain
[1:09:28] but the but only the seed that is
[1:09:32] planted will grow amen so Joshua and
[1:09:38] Caleb when they were first heard the
[1:09:42] word of Moses they like everyone else
[1:09:45] around them had to decide whether they
[1:09:47] would follow Moses or not amen and when
[1:09:50] it came to the time when everybody
[1:09:52] around them was pointing their finger at
[1:09:54] Moses and blaming Moses that Joshua and
[1:09:57] Caleb said no I am going to receive the
[1:10:01] word that God gave unto Moses and even
[1:10:03] though maybe it seems like we're running
[1:10:05] out of water maybe it seems like we're
[1:10:07] running a revival maybe it seems like
[1:10:09] we're running out of this or running out
[1:10:11] of that I am gonna stand here and I am
[1:10:14] gonna listen and be obedient to the word
[1:10:16] that Moses said Amen and Joshua and
[1:10:20] Caleb got to see that pay off in the end
[1:10:22] when they crossed over forty years later
[1:10:24] into the Promised Land Amen you know I
[1:10:27] think about it you know Joshua and Caleb
[1:10:30] they shouldn't have had to go those
[1:10:33] forty years you know they were raised
[1:10:37] going in forty years ago amen
[1:10:41] they shouldn't have had to but you know
[1:10:45] the thing about it is is they had a word
[1:10:47] that they rejoiced over the entire time
[1:10:49] and maybe all around them was testifying
[1:10:53] it there in the desert but there's
[1:10:54] something about the Word of God they'd
[1:10:56] receive
[1:10:57] that they you know they got to eat the
[1:10:59] man and they got to drink the water from
[1:11:00] the rock and God fed them all the way
[1:11:03] through and it was sudden about is that
[1:11:05] everybody has ever everybody around them
[1:11:07] was blaming the situation was blaming
[1:11:10] this and blaming this that Joshua and
[1:11:12] Caleb had their eyes upon the Word of
[1:11:15] God amen and tell you what let me tell
[1:11:17] you what they were in their promised
[1:11:18] land amen
[1:11:21] you know their their physical body may
[1:11:23] seem like they're wandering through a
[1:11:25] desert but let me tell you what Joshua
[1:11:27] and Caleb they were in their promised
[1:11:29] land already amen they already possessed
[1:11:31] it why because the moment they accepted
[1:11:34] it was the moment that it was given to
[1:11:36] them amen amen and God took care of them
[1:11:39] all the way through amen it's the same
[1:11:41] thing of any true believer of God a man
[1:11:43] doesn't matter even if the church they
[1:11:45] go to Amen they're not relying on the
[1:11:47] church they go to to bring them their
[1:11:49] revival amen they have their own revival
[1:11:52] Amen that they have prepared the ground
[1:11:54] for God to water his rain upon a man
[1:12:00] they've already heard the word Amen in
[1:12:03] the time of the teaching rain they heard
[1:12:05] the word of God they took their time to
[1:12:07] listen to the Word of God they took
[1:12:09] their time to hear the word of God and
[1:12:11] they said yes and amen - amen
[1:12:13] and then they took and looked at their
[1:12:15] land Amen they they took care of all the
[1:12:17] dirt all the rocks amen and they made
[1:12:19] their land a good ground by believing
[1:12:21] the Word of God a man what are they
[1:12:23] doing they're preparing for a time when
[1:12:25] God was finally gonna send the rain from
[1:12:28] heaven amen
[1:12:31] but you know there is another promise
[1:12:32] besides just set there was a promise
[1:12:34] from the time of David who says I will
[1:12:36] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:12:38] waters a mint you know there are people
[1:12:40] that even in a dry desert place could
[1:12:43] still bring forth their fruit in due
[1:12:45] season amen remember David said I am
[1:12:49] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:12:51] water amen so when the when the dry time
[1:12:55] comes when everybody else is fading and
[1:12:57] withering rate you know Joshua and Caleb
[1:12:59] they experienced that everybody else was
[1:13:01] fading and withering away they were
[1:13:03] losing their experience amen the the the
[1:13:06] when the Red Sea was part of 20 years
[1:13:09] ago or 30 years ago is beginning to
[1:13:11] fade away in their memory about how
[1:13:13] powerful or God was but there was still
[1:13:15] a tree planted by the rivers of water by
[1:13:18] the name of Joshua there was another one
[1:13:20] by the name of Caleb that they are
[1:13:22] planted by the rivers of living water
[1:13:24] and they can always refer back to the
[1:13:26] power of God and clinging hold on to the
[1:13:29] Amen and think of it is is you know
[1:13:33] those trees are planted by the rivers of
[1:13:37] water always have in their mind to be
[1:13:39] able to see God's actions wherever they
[1:13:42] go you know it's like some people they
[1:13:45] can go out to the desert and they say
[1:13:46] boy there's just nothing living out here
[1:13:48] mm but you take someone who like a
[1:13:50] biologist's you'll see life all over
[1:13:53] that place Amen you'll see little
[1:13:55] footprints here just see this little
[1:13:57] brush or shrub here you see a little
[1:13:59] creek here there's things growing all
[1:14:01] over the place
[1:14:02] amen there's some plants that that it
[1:14:05] only rains once a year and it will take
[1:14:08] every single drop of rain you can get it
[1:14:10] and store it up amen amen
[1:14:15] so is it was a Christian they were the
[1:14:18] one plant will say Oh a dry place it'll
[1:14:20] just wither up and die but there's
[1:14:21] another one that will grab every single
[1:14:24] drop of rain and say thank you lord
[1:14:26] thank you lord thank you and what will
[1:14:28] it do it will not let a plant that is
[1:14:31] designed to operate in the desert will
[1:14:34] not let the lack of water will not let a
[1:14:38] lack of water in the congregation right
[1:14:41] amen
[1:14:42] it will not let a lack of water in the
[1:14:44] congregation prevent them from
[1:14:46] expressing what the DNA on the inside of
[1:14:49] them says it's supposed to Express amen
[1:14:53] why because that plant was ate was was
[1:14:56] designed to during the times of rain
[1:15:00] store up all the water necessary amen to
[1:15:04] get it through from one rain to the next
[1:15:06] ring amen
[1:15:08] so is is the same thing in Matthew
[1:15:10] chapter 25 with the wise and foolish
[1:15:12] virgins amen
[1:15:13] there was two different types of virgins
[1:15:16] one had more capacity for oil than the
[1:15:18] other hat amen so then there was a
[1:15:20] during the time of refilling of the oil
[1:15:23] the one only
[1:15:25] had what was in her lamp but the other
[1:15:27] had another capacity besides her lamp
[1:15:30] that she could draw from so that because
[1:15:32] the oil was only given at one time at
[1:15:35] the beginning amen and that oil one had
[1:15:37] enough oil to see her through all the
[1:15:40] way through amen and so it is with a
[1:15:42] Christian Amen it could seem like a dry
[1:15:45] time in the congregation of the Saints
[1:15:47] but yet they have a connection with
[1:15:49] Almighty God amen swear they will never
[1:15:52] run out of oil they are like a tree
[1:15:54] planted from the river water they have
[1:15:56] another reservoir to draw from the
[1:15:59] others may not seem to have a manson
[1:16:02] when the dry time comes hey what does it
[1:16:04] think they like like Abraham says when
[1:16:07] they tried to give him all the the
[1:16:09] riches of Sodom he says I will not
[1:16:11] receive the riches of song from you I
[1:16:13] don't need those to survive because I
[1:16:15] have lifted my hand unto Jehovah Amen he
[1:16:18] is my provider he gives me all I forsake
[1:16:21] and sought him I forsaken all the things
[1:16:24] that sought him I've lifted my hand unto
[1:16:26] Jehovah unto him i will seek amen and
[1:16:30] what'd he do he was a tree planted by
[1:16:32] the water he had this he had the the
[1:16:35] sign of his times was constantly growing
[1:16:39] anyway what'd he have he had a seed that
[1:16:42] was planted on the inside of him that
[1:16:43] was to manifest the age that he was
[1:16:45] living in so does the Bride of Christ
[1:16:48] she has a seed that was planted on the
[1:16:51] inside of her by a by a private
[1:16:54] messenger right a meant a prophet came
[1:16:56] in our age he planted a seat we heard it
[1:16:59] we listened to it
[1:17:00] amen and was a - what is that seed that
[1:17:03] seed is supposed to grow in good ground
[1:17:06] amen now many can choose how they will
[1:17:10] receive this message that was given to
[1:17:12] us and what type of ground because know
[1:17:15] now now a rain is going to come there
[1:17:19] will be a ladder rain they'll come in
[1:17:21] water the seat amen but remember when
[1:17:26] this ladder ring comes it will only
[1:17:31] manifest one the seed that's planted and
[1:17:34] to the seed will only grow in good
[1:17:37] ground
[1:17:39] so it will do us no good to rejoice over
[1:17:43] this message if we do not have a ground
[1:17:45] that is prepared to receive the message
[1:17:47] a man which would be a true heart of
[1:17:49] faith is the only ground that seed can
[1:17:51] grow in a man was to do you forsake all
[1:17:54] and receive Christ forsake all and
[1:17:58] receive crisis he was like such a simple
[1:18:00] message amen now this promised land is
[1:18:03] not like the land of Egypt but the only
[1:18:05] way we can get rain is for when God
[1:18:07] Himself sends it amen
[1:18:10] what is our duty is to receive the seed
[1:18:13] in good ground amen receive the seed in
[1:18:16] good ground amen
[1:18:19] and God says a ladder rain will come and
[1:18:24] when it comes it will bear fruit bear
[1:18:27] forth its fruit in its season amen amen
[1:18:33] you know as a they they they try to
[1:18:38] force a ladder rain
[1:18:49] and I've seen that you know I've seen so
[1:18:53] many people they try to forsake
[1:18:55] they try to manufacture a Holy Spirit
[1:18:57] rain
[1:18:58] amen but you know God you know if you
[1:19:06] had a bag full of the most noxious weeds
[1:19:10] seeds you can imagine in your ground and
[1:19:14] you thought you know I need to get those
[1:19:17] out of there before the rain comes amen
[1:19:20] then you better get those out of there
[1:19:22] because you don't want the rain to fall
[1:19:24] on the wrong seat amen you know that you
[1:19:27] know they they got a lot of all over the
[1:19:30] world they they're they're trying to
[1:19:33] keep weeds going from one area of the
[1:19:37] earth to another area of the earth
[1:19:38] because a weed that is kept in control
[1:19:40] in this continent over here effect like
[1:19:43] dandelions dandelions aren't native of
[1:19:45] the United States amen but the Dutch
[1:19:47] brought over some dandelions amen and
[1:19:50] now what dandelions have taken over the
[1:19:52] entire country amen so it's the same
[1:19:54] thing with with with us is people will
[1:19:58] receive seeds in their life that didn't
[1:20:01] come from God amen and they don't
[1:20:04] realize that that what was by holding on
[1:20:07] to those seeds that someone these days
[1:20:09] it is going to rain amen
[1:20:12] I used might think that these seeds are
[1:20:14] harmless but once you receive this some
[1:20:17] other see from somewhere else and you
[1:20:20] think oh it's just a little see it's
[1:20:21] just okay but you receive that in your
[1:20:23] heart you let it lay there then when the
[1:20:25] Rutte rain does come you're gonna get
[1:20:28] something that you weren't expecting
[1:20:30] amen amen brother Branham when he was
[1:20:35] preaching the message the endtime seed
[1:20:37] sign
[1:20:45] he said there's been a national teaching
[1:20:49] rain and you know that's true you know
[1:20:53] and every Christian gets that teaching
[1:20:55] rain time also he says he said there was
[1:20:59] also he says there's there's a revival
[1:21:01] going on what is it it's a sowing Amen
[1:21:05] he said you don't hear very much of
[1:21:06] Billy Graham no more do you or oral what
[1:21:09] about the rest of them you know the
[1:21:11] great revival fires not burning what is
[1:21:13] it it's the endtime seed sign the words
[1:21:17] has been sown what is it denomination
[1:21:20] will reap denomination and that makes
[1:21:22] them Confederate themselves together
[1:21:24] amen and we've seen that you know one
[1:21:27] thing about brother Branham is he saw
[1:21:28] everything in seed form and preached
[1:21:31] against it and everybody say well why do
[1:21:33] you preach against that has so little
[1:21:35] that's so small why would you preach
[1:21:37] against I Love Lucy why would you preach
[1:21:41] against that it seems so you know if you
[1:21:43] think if you compare Elvis Presley to
[1:21:45] some of the death metal bands that they
[1:21:47] have today
[1:21:47] you know you think well he preached
[1:21:49] against that but but look at what that
[1:21:51] produced amen and we see that there were
[1:21:55] so many seeds that were planted in this
[1:21:57] country in the 1940s 1950s amen and what
[1:22:00] do they do he preached against the seats
[1:22:03] and then the ministry was sealed off the
[1:22:07] ministry was finished amen and what do
[1:22:10] we do now we live in the harvest time
[1:22:11] and we see all of those TV shows amen
[1:22:15] all of that music from the 40s of 50s
[1:22:18] all the sudden has grown up and sprouted
[1:22:20] and ground branches and now it's bearing
[1:22:22] fruit another generation another
[1:22:25] generation amen
[1:22:27] Lee says but the Word of God has been
[1:22:29] sowed also amen and when the Spirit of
[1:22:33] God begins to fall the Word of God will
[1:22:36] live in the people Amen he says and that
[1:22:39] false bride that's committed adultery
[1:22:42] out there
[1:22:43] she brought herself into Creed's and
[1:22:45] sold out her birth rights will reap what
[1:22:46] a confederation of churches that's bound
[1:22:50] and burned like the thorns and thistles
[1:22:53] I'm anybody says but where the word of
[1:22:56] God's been so
[1:22:58] the people's heart it will reap a bride
[1:23:00] for Christ as certain as I'm standing
[1:23:02] here amen as certain as I'm standing
[1:23:05] here I'm gonna so be careful what seeds
[1:23:08] why because now we are closer to the
[1:23:11] latter rain thing we've ever been amen
[1:23:16] now there is a time where you have time
[1:23:18] to read out the old seats amen we have a
[1:23:21] time there is a there you have a time of
[1:23:23] grace where you can take those old seeds
[1:23:26] out of your life where you can burn up
[1:23:29] the ground where you can turn over the
[1:23:30] soil where you can prepare it you know
[1:23:32] to receive the word we can pass the Lord
[1:23:35] to sanctify your heart sanctify your
[1:23:37] life amen
[1:23:38] there is a time of grace for that amen
[1:23:40] but there will be a time when that grace
[1:23:42] a man word when the latter ring comes
[1:23:45] that that's not the time to be preparing
[1:23:48] your heart no the time to prepare your
[1:23:51] heart is now when you're receiving the
[1:23:53] word Amen it's now when you're receiving
[1:23:55] the word Amen amen amen
[1:24:06] spoken words original seat Blair Bram
[1:24:08] says Elijah's behavior Moses his
[1:24:12] behavior John's behavior leaving their
[1:24:16] field of service many of the people
[1:24:19] didn't understand them it was because
[1:24:21] they was rejected and their message the
[1:24:24] seed had been sown judgment was next and
[1:24:28] they was assigned to the people from God
[1:24:31] that judgment was at hand planting was
[1:24:35] over amen
[1:24:37] there after that he said I believe
[1:24:39] someday the real Bride of Christ will be
[1:24:41] forced to stop preaching the Word of God
[1:24:44] amen no that hasn't happened yet the
[1:24:47] bride price is still preaching
[1:24:49] amen but as the the tares are bound up
[1:24:52] tighter and tighter the bride will stand
[1:24:54] alone and then there will be an attack
[1:24:57] what against everybody that's stand you
[1:24:58] alone amen
[1:25:00] you know there's such a proprietary
[1:25:03] nature among so many things in this
[1:25:07] world you know
[1:25:10] you know it's like it's interesting III
[1:25:13] I don't know how much I want to get into
[1:25:16] it but you know there's mine now
[1:25:31] the denominational nature anytime you
[1:25:34] see it where people say we have to put
[1:25:38] our trust in this man-made system
[1:25:40] wherever you see that comes self on this
[1:25:43] earth stay away from it anytime you see
[1:25:47] a man-made system being put in place and
[1:25:51] then where you have to put your trust in
[1:25:53] that man-made system stay away from that
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:56] you have to state you have to stand
[1:25:59] alone on the Word of God that has been
[1:26:01] preached to you you have to stand alone
[1:26:02] why because there will come a dry time a
[1:26:04] testing time amen what are you doing
[1:26:07] your standing it alone you're waiting
[1:26:09] for the rain to come and what do you do
[1:26:10] you have to stand there and wait upon
[1:26:12] the word that's gone before you brought
[1:26:14] as God said in in Exodus he says I
[1:26:17] expect you to see the sign and believe
[1:26:20] forever amen amen all of us have seen
[1:26:24] enough to believe in God amen and we're
[1:26:28] gonna see some more amen but it's just
[1:26:30] like those in the desert some people go
[1:26:32] out in the desert and say there's
[1:26:33] nothing living out here but for the tree
[1:26:35] is planted by the rivers of water we
