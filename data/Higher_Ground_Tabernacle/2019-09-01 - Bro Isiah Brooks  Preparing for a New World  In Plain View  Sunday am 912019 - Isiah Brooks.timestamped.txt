[15:14] you on this morning
[15:16] so as we stand turn with us to Matthew
[15:20] the 27th chapter
[15:33] from Matthew 27 we'll go to second pita
[15:36] third chapter
[15:45] Matthew 27 and we go to second Peter
[16:03] good to see everybody here this morning
[16:05] trust and pray the Lord will bless you
[16:07] in a special way Matthew 27 beginning at
[16:13] the 51st verse
[16:27] and behold the veil of the temple was
[16:30] rent in twain from the top to the bottom
[16:35] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[16:39] red and the graves were opened and many
[16:44] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[16:47] and came out of the grave after his
[16:51] resurrection and went into the city and
[16:55] appeared unto many now when the
[16:59] Centurion and they that were with him
[17:04] watching Jesus saw the earthquake and
[17:08] those things that were done they feared
[17:12] greatly saying truly this was the son of
[17:16] God hallelujah 2nd Peter
[17:35] James Peter get up the Lord
[17:49] second Peter the third chapter we begin
[17:53] reading at the eighth verse
[18:04] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[18:07] thing that one day with the Lord as a
[18:13] thousand years and a thousand years as
[18:18] one day the Lord is not slack concerning
[18:22] his promise as some men count slackness
[18:26] but is long-suffering to us-ward not
[18:31] willing that any should perish but that
[18:36] all should come to repentance but the
[18:41] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[18:43] the night in the which the heavens shall
[18:47] pass away with a great noise and the
[18:51] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[18:54] the earth also and the works that are
[18:58] therein shall be burned up let us pray
[19:05] aye Heavenly Father we come again Lord
[19:10] to you as humbly as we know how we are a
[19:16] needy people but Lord you have chosen us
[19:22] and you have set us aside you've called
[19:26] us to a message that has been designed
[19:31] to bring us to perfection
[19:35] father we pray this morning that you
[19:40] would enlighten our hearts open our eyes
[19:44] open our ears give us a heart not only
[19:49] to believe it but to receive it and
[19:53] father will be careful to give you the
[19:56] praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's
[20:01] name we pray amen
[20:03] you may be seated
[20:14] subject on this morning is preparing for
[20:21] a new world subtopic would be in plain
[20:32] view I dealt with the scripture
[20:37] according to Matthew 27 for the very
[20:42] fact that God was trying to get over to
[20:47] Israel
[20:49] that basically the traditions of the law
[20:53] was over church anity as Israel knew it
[21:02] was now dead the reality of what they
[21:10] were worshipping was now in plain view
[21:17] they had in their day denominational
[21:22] issues Pharisees Sadducees Herodian
[21:27] scribes in every man in his own eyes
[21:33] believed that he was right we come to
[21:38] find out that when Jesus came he gave
[21:46] them the truth if you and I can think
[21:51] about it
[21:54] how that even in the Garden of Eden when
[21:59] Cain wanted to build a system to worship
[22:05] God in it was rejected even then and God
[22:13] showed Cain that the only place to
[22:16] worship was under the blood of the Lamb
[22:22] as it was in that day it is in this day
[22:30] we have come in a time where
[22:35] denominationalism is flourishing but you
[22:40] and I have been told the secrets of God
[22:47] don't ever take this message for granted
[22:53] God has given you and I something that
[22:56] the world and the denominationalism our
[23:00] denominational cannot even comprehend
[23:10] they saw when the temple was rent when
[23:18] the resurrection took place they saw
[23:21] behind the veil and mind you according
[23:28] to history the Ark of the Covenant
[23:31] wasn't even there so in reality the
[23:40] Pharisees and the Sadducees had been
[23:43] faking it in other words they were
[23:47] worshipping nothing because without the
[23:51] ark there was no God there was no real
[23:55] worship but those Pharisees and
[23:58] Sadducees those priests of that day made
[24:02] the people think that the OP was back
[24:04] there so God read the Vail he led to the
[24:12] shoulder people that they're worshiping
[24:17] was in vain whew somebody help me here
[24:21] see without the blood of Jesus Christ
[24:24] your worship is in vain it doesn't
[24:32] matter how great your religions are how
[24:36] many members you have come on somebody
[24:42] without the lamb of God without the
[24:46] blood of Jesus your worship is in vain
[24:51] and here was the lamb the true Lamb of
[24:56] God where was he a low-calorie strip
[25:05] naked and here was God was trying to
[25:09] tell the people don't look there but
[25:12] look here that's why in the psalm says I
[25:17] look toward the heel even David coffee
[25:21] inspiration that the real Lamb of God
[25:24] would be located on top of a heel the
[25:30] naked wire was now being revealed to
[25:33] them you know what they did they scold
[25:36] it they marked it they rejected it
[25:42] hallelujah and therefore they're
[25:46] suffering to this day because they made
[25:50] the statement let his blood be on us in
[25:55] our children and the Jews have suffered
[26:01] every since what are you saying every
[26:05] time a nation rejects the gospel of
[26:08] Jesus Christ they go into darkness and
[26:10] therefore they suffer is that right look
[26:15] at England look at Germany look where
[26:21] all of the gospel travels from and see
[26:24] what has happened look at America what
[26:28] we have turned and transformed into is
[26:31] because we rejected the Lamb we rejected
[26:36] the blood of Jesus Christ and we settled
[26:40] for religion is that right remember in
[26:45] the message God provided way of worship
[26:48] brother Brownlee used to scripture out
[26:50] of the Old Testament where he says there
[26:52] were many of gates and Gaza
[26:55] don't worship me in any date but worship
[27:01] me only in the gate where I placed my
[27:04] name hallelujah and then Jesus comes
[27:09] along and said to Peter don't you
[27:15] understand that the revelation I'm
[27:19] giving you the gates of Hell shall not
[27:23] prevail when Peter said thou art the
[27:28] Christ the Son of the Living God
[27:33] flesh and blood jesus said has not
[27:36] revealed this unto you but my father
[27:39] which is in heaven he has revealed this
[27:42] unto you notice notice that the the
[27:46] church is going to be built upon this
[27:49] revelation of who Jesus is of whom the
[27:54] name of where the name is being placed
[27:57] God's name of worship the bride would
[28:04] catch this she will know this she will
[28:10] know the place where God will honor
[28:16] worship is that right she can you can
[28:20] worship God the Bible says they worship
[28:24] me but they worship me in vain who are
[28:28] they those who don't know where God has
[28:32] placed his name I hope this is a
[28:36] blessing to you see we're preparing and
[28:40] I love this I'm so excited because I
[28:42] want to get it out the way God gave it
[28:44] to me I'm excited you know I used to
[28:48] read that scripture where Jesus was said
[28:52] let not your heart be troubled if you
[28:55] believe in God believe also in me for in
[29:00] my father's house there are many
[29:02] mansions if it were not so I would not
[29:06] have told you and I'm gonna stop here
[29:09] I go to prepare a place for you in other
[29:14] words this is not my home
[29:16] this is not your home there is another
[29:20] place and wherever that is you will be
[29:24] also somebody help me here see I cannot
[29:28] allow myself to be tangled with worldly
[29:34] affairs I can't allow myself a men to be
[29:40] so engrossed with trying to be something
[29:45] in this world is that right the Bible
[29:49] said what will the gain what profit will
[29:52] it gain you or give you to gain the
[29:56] whole world and then lose your soul yes
[30:00] you don't say it's okay to be prosperous
[30:04] because God said I word that your
[30:07] property you prosper even as your soul
[30:09] prospers
[30:10] so prosperity is not something God will
[30:13] withhold as long as your soul is
[30:17] prospered you're in the channel where
[30:20] God can prosper you but understand this
[30:25] never forget that you and I are Pilgrims
[30:30] and strangers we're just traveling we're
[30:35] like Abraham we're looking for a city
[30:38] whose builder and maker is God when you
[30:49] can see this you will understand and you
[30:54] you understand the world is going to be
[30:57] as it is nothing is going to change it
[31:04] y'all hear me we have been born or we
[31:10] have been birthed into a world of death
[31:18] hello somebody call it what you want to
[31:24] call it but even when a baby is born it
[31:29] has been born to die come on somebody
[31:34] the moment that baby takes his breath it
[31:39] also moves toward death come on somebody
[31:44] hallelujah brother branham tells us he
[31:47] said after the 25 years death really
[31:51] sets in that's when you can feel it
[31:55] that's when you begin to see it that
[31:59] right this is a listen everything that
[32:02] lives in this world must die no way out
[32:07] of it there is no other way to see it
[32:12] you not must understand men that's why
[32:15] we must understand and not get
[32:17] complacent we're not to settle here Oh
[32:21] hallelujah
[32:23] this is why when God called Israel he
[32:27] put them in tents y'all remember those
[32:31] God put Israel's in tents why because
[32:34] when God would move God wanted them to
[32:37] move hallelujah God never intended for
[32:41] Israel to become stationary hallelujah
[32:46] remember now it was actually Davis idea
[32:50] to be Oh God a place hallelujah and so
[32:58] we realized there was a destiny there is
[33:02] a place where we will one day settle but
[33:07] as we are in this world we must keep on
[33:11] journeying we must keep on moving and as
[33:15] the pillar of fire moves we must move
[33:18] with it think about it
[33:27] Jesus was in plain view elimi hurry
[33:30] Jesus
[33:31] became playing view and throughout all
[33:34] of the church ages they knew the real
[33:39] believer knew that the only place of
[33:43] worship was under the blood of Jesus
[33:45] Christ
[33:46] see that's why they can move everywhere
[33:49] when when trouble came trials would come
[33:52] upon them and they would scatter and go
[33:55] everywhere they knew that God would be
[33:57] with them because they were under the
[34:00] blood you see them saying not under some
[34:04] men's ministry not under some man's
[34:06] building but they were under the blood
[34:10] because their lives height was in Christ
[34:15] oh lord have mercy see Israel didn't
[34:21] know that
[34:21] so when Titus came they thought it would
[34:25] they would run a test into their city
[34:27] they thought if they would run into
[34:29] Jerusalem that they would be safe but
[34:33] Jerusalem was no longer a safe haven God
[34:37] had turned the corner the only place
[34:42] that would be safe was in Jesus is that
[34:47] right hallelujah it was Jesus the Word
[34:50] of God that told them when you see this
[34:55] city encompassed about with the armies
[34:59] don't go back and get your stuff
[35:04] hallelujah what are you saying brother
[35:07] Brooks that was the issue and it's an
[35:10] issue now people we've got too much
[35:15] stuff we've got too much stuff that we
[35:20] cares about hallelujah somebody help me
[35:24] here you see it is those things that
[35:27] will cause you to look back and forget
[35:31] where you're going
[35:33] somebody help me here oh it's your truth
[35:39] let me move on
[35:45] the Bob the Lord said God is not slack
[35:48] concerning his promises let me say this
[35:53] to you did you not know that when
[35:55] brother Branham was here on earth in the
[35:58] flesh those days were considered the
[36:02] days of Noah not people think well it
[36:07] was no no no it was then we were in the
[36:11] days of Noah we were in the days of
[36:14] Sodom and Gomorrah then so if he's gone
[36:18] now he's just over in the other
[36:21] dimension you understand me so if there
[36:25] was that late in the evening where
[36:28] judgment was going to strike y'all know
[36:31] why judgment didn't strike
[36:33] did you know do anybody know because we
[36:37] had a prophet hallelujah like Moses
[36:42] stood in the gap for Israel and told God
[36:45] please whatever you do don't kill them
[36:49] God had a prophet with the inspiration
[36:53] of Moses that stood in the gap with the
[36:57] church angels were completely blacking
[37:00] out God gave grace thank God for the
[37:06] Amazing Race and he wrote that little
[37:10] light in there and that light represents
[37:13] you and me hallelujah hallelujah he
[37:20] we're living on the grace of God
[37:27] hallelujah thank God for the grace
[37:32] hallelujah you call it Amazing Grace
[37:36] hallelujah
[37:38] abundance of grace that God would spare
[37:43] us at a time when the world should have
[37:47] been destroyed my but he could not do it
[37:52] then God had to behold him just like he
[37:58] did in World War one he said all the
[38:00] four winds you see what I'm saying I'm
[38:04] going to get to it in just a moment
[38:06] he went I'm gonna throw it out at you
[38:08] went and I went when God told Adam and
[38:12] Eve to be fruitful and multiply they
[38:21] never brought forth a world full of the
[38:28] sons of God Satan and his plan kept
[38:34] messing it up you say what do you mean I
[38:38] got some quotes even the prophet of God
[38:42] tells us that when Adam and Eve the
[38:45] natural heaven Eve never did he said now
[38:47] watch this because when the world got to
[38:51] the place I want you to see what I'm
[38:53] saying now when the world was populated
[38:56] Genesis six the Bible said violence was
[39:00] in the land don't sound like heaven
[39:03] how do you come up the Bible tells us
[39:07] men were marrying and giving in marriage
[39:08] don't sound like heaven don't sound like
[39:12] the word that's why God could destroy
[39:17] Satan was trying to stop the sons of God
[39:21] from replenishing the earth
[39:25] he killed Abel and every time a true son
[39:31] of God came by Satan tried to kill him
[39:35] hallelujah
[39:37] but you see he could not the word said
[39:40] once it comes out of the mouth of God it
[39:42] cannot come back
[39:44] Oh somebody help me here so every time
[39:49] throughout ages when the righteous seed
[39:52] would die what did God do pack them away
[39:57] and put them in a place of safety one of
[40:01] these old days you gonna get up out of
[40:04] here hallelujah you see I have a greater
[40:08] place for you ooh oh they probably
[40:13] thought paradise was really nice our
[40:15] paradise was nice but paradise was not
[40:18] the place God promised Oh somebody help
[40:23] me here so God will separate the
[40:26] righteous from the wicked in that
[40:29] dimension and he kept safe those that
[40:33] were of God is that the word remember
[40:36] the rich young ruler when he died he
[40:40] looked up and he saw Lazarus and he said
[40:42] Lazarus just dip your finger in some
[40:47] cool water and place it on my tongue
[40:49] what was it though he was religious the
[40:55] rich young ruler religious he when Jesus
[40:58] said I want you to do this this is he
[41:00] said I've done all these things from my
[41:03] youth
[41:03] meaning that he was a businessman he
[41:06] knew and he had done all those righteous
[41:09] good things come on somebody yes sir
[41:14] the rich young ruler had done all those
[41:18] things but he turned down the door of
[41:24] entrance is that right because Jesus
[41:29] says I am the door Jesus says I am the
[41:32] way
[41:32] Jesus says amen I am the way the truth
[41:36] and the life no religion won't get it it
[41:41] doesn't matter what church you go to it
[41:43] doesn't matter if you come to this pad
[41:45] this tribe cannot secure you only the
[41:48] blood of Jesus
[41:53] hmm rich young ruler brother Brown said
[42:01] he did it all right but he had stopped
[42:12] jesus said and that's what he's saying
[42:14] you can't make it into this city until
[42:16] you give up everything whoo everything
[42:23] all your little habits
[42:25] remember habits of demons bad habits or
[42:29] demons all your little ways every little
[42:33] thing my temper everything everything
[42:38] that's not of God has to go somebody
[42:42] help me here ha ha ha
[42:43] see this is what I'm trying to tell
[42:45] we've got so many people in the message
[42:48] we've been jumping and shouting and
[42:50] praising God which is all good but we
[42:53] don't want all of that to be in vain
[42:56] hallelujah and all of that will be in
[42:58] vain until you enter into Christ and
[43:02] until Christ enter into you it is the
[43:05] only hiding place is that right jesus
[43:10] said I come in my father's name and you
[43:13] won't receive me but another will come
[43:16] in his name and you would receive
[43:19] hallelujah let me bring it down to our
[43:21] doorstep
[43:22] oh we're not Pentecostal but we're the
[43:25] message claiming the message don't do
[43:29] nothing that the devil knows right
[43:33] Provenza you can't just sympathize with
[43:36] it
[43:36] you got to get into it and it must get
[43:40] into you we're at a crucial time we are
[43:46] at a crucial time
[43:48] and we just see the people something's
[43:51] wrong
[43:53] come on somebody something's wrong you
[43:56] don't see I was telling the brother the
[43:58] other day when the last you seen real
[44:02] repentance when have you seen somebody
[44:05] broken when have you seen somebody
[44:08] weeping for the Lord asking for
[44:11] forgiveness or asking for the Holy Ghost
[44:16] something's wrong
[44:18] remember my last message not the last
[44:21] one when I preached escaping escaping
[44:24] from this darkness it's going to take
[44:27] God Satan is a smart character and he
[44:32] makes you think you somebody just like
[44:34] you thought made ething she was somebody
[44:36] we're nothing without God we could never
[44:40] be anything without God God is
[44:42] everything
[44:46] hallelujah it's scary because we don't
[44:56] believe that what took place with Moses
[44:58] and his message can take place with us
[45:02] millions followed Moses but only Joshua
[45:06] and Caleb caught the revelation and the
[45:10] Bible said they had a different spirit
[45:13] oh come on somebody let me tell you all
[45:17] that fighting that we do with one
[45:20] another it got to stop fussing and
[45:24] fighting it must stop and there are some
[45:30] people who have inherited a fussing and
[45:34] fighting spirit it's got to go in all of
[45:41] the into this city nothing but the
[45:44] righteous nothing but the holy y'all
[45:48] hear what I'm saying
[45:49] Oh somebody help me here listen and he's
[45:53] already told us he said I go to prepare
[45:55] a place for you and if I go and prepare
[45:58] a place for you I will come
[46:00] and receive you unto myself but that
[46:03] where I am there ye may be also you
[46:08] understand me
[46:09] so there is a city there is a place that
[46:13] God has prepared for us now the Bible
[46:21] tells us according to 1st Thessalonians
[46:28] 4 you don't have to turn 4 14 through 7
[46:32] says for if we believe that Jesus died
[46:36] and rose again even so them also which
[46:40] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
[46:46] for this we say unto you by the word of
[46:51] the Lord that we which are alive and
[46:54] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[46:58] not prevent them which are sleep let me
[47:02] pause here for a moment because you know
[47:05] brother Branham brings it out that one
[47:07] resurrection has already taken place is
[47:10] that right all that slept in God when
[47:15] Jesus was raised from the dead I read
[47:17] the scripture when the veil was rent the
[47:21] Bible said those that were asleep in the
[47:24] grave arose Oh somebody help me here why
[47:28] because he was the only entrance he was
[47:32] the only entrance into heaven you can't
[47:35] get into heaven without Jesus he's the
[47:37] only way in the dog didn't open for for
[47:42] for for Josh away the dog didn't open
[47:46] for Moses but when they when Jesus
[47:49] approached when he approached the gates
[47:52] of heaven hallelujah he said open up
[47:59] these gates and let these gates be
[48:02] lifted up hallelujah
[48:04] open up they said who is this that y'all
[48:09] heard the word the Lord
[48:15] strong and mighty I just defeated Satan
[48:19] the blood is still fresh hallelujah my
[48:23] life has conquered death
[48:24] Helena Bay lift up your gates and ye
[48:29] everlasting doors and do what let the
[48:31] King of glory come in you see what
[48:35] brother Balin ministry was brother
[48:37] Branham ministry was not to show himself
[48:40] brother Branham ministry was to bring
[48:42] forth the promises that were already
[48:44] written in the word hallelujah he was a
[48:48] living proof that Malachi 4 was right
[48:51] somebody help me here he was the living
[48:54] proof that revelation 10 7 was a lie
[48:58] hallelujah that scripture lived through
[49:01] his life hallelujah and every word of
[49:05] God must be proven
[49:07] it must be manifested in the bride
[49:11] hallelujah come on somebody see what we
[49:15] have is not a religion it is life come
[49:22] on you know there's a lot of preachers
[49:24] who think that this is a religion they
[49:30] figured they can do whatever they want
[49:31] to do with this message they think that
[49:34] they can lord over God's flock
[49:36] hallelujah if that's what you're looking
[49:39] for you in the wrong place
[49:40] I'm not here to lord over you I'm not
[49:45] gonna make you do nothing but I will
[49:47] bring the word it's up to you to hear
[49:51] and receive somebody help me here
[49:54] no sir I will not have the spirit of
[49:57] Nicolaitans on me I am NOT going to be
[50:01] your master there's only one master and
[50:03] that's Jesus Christ himself
[50:06] hallelujah so that's where I am at I
[50:12] believe that Jesus Christ is my head and
[50:15] he's your head
[50:17] hallelujah I'm not here to rule over you
[50:21] the word is somebody help me here so you
[50:27] got to understand that when Jesus said

[50:31] those people who died with that promise
[50:34] whoo they got up and Sarah got up Moses
[50:43] got up everybody that died in Christ in
[50:46] the Old Testament got up you may not
[50:50] understand this but you see when Jesus

[52:08] scripture for this but this is what I

[52:15] sobic hesitate must have looked
[52:17] something like Jesus somebody help me
[52:23] here
[52:23] that's all I'm saying the original
[52:26] because of that is Jesus Christ so
[52:28] anyway let's go on because a lot of
[52:30] times people don't
[52:31] like when you do that but my that's
[52:32] where I get it you know you got to read
[52:35] between the lines yeah so anyway and
[52:39] then he says oh my goodness look and
[52:41] then he's an odd job just I won't see
[52:44] this thing Joe said oh my god that's the
[52:49] one who I saw on the ash heap now I did
[52:53] not understand but I understand now why
[52:56] I was very difficult to get job off the
[52:58] ash heap as long as it's children and
[53:04] everything we're doing wrong Joe was
[53:06] still on the ash heap you should never
[53:09] get off the ash heap as long as you got
[53:13] some prayers that needs to be answered
[53:15] somebody help me here the ash heap was
[53:18] where all the sacrifices had been bribed
[53:21] hallelujah and it was there the
[53:24] revelation of the Resurrection came -
[53:26] don't you understand every Kingdom must
[53:36] be done away with hmm that's the prophet
[53:40] of God says let me read this quote to
[53:43] you he said the woman II was the tree of
[53:47] death we all taste of her being born in
[53:53] this world and as sure as we're born of
[53:57] a woman we got to die everybody said
[54:01] amen
[54:03] see that's what I was telling my brother
[54:05] he has been he has cancer and I told him
[54:10] I said you know the difference between
[54:11] me and others I said other preachers
[54:14] would prepare the people on how to live
[54:17] in this world but I have a message that
[54:21] prepares the people how to die and live
[54:24] in the world to come y'all help me here
[54:28] hallelujah see I'm dying to live not
[54:33] living to die done died already
[54:36] [Laughter]
[54:37] hallelujah but I'm living to die so I
[54:41] can live again or what you say dying to
[54:45] live and as sure as we are born of the
[54:49] man Jesus Christ we live forever yes if
[54:58] you eat that you'll surely die if you
[55:02] eat this you'll surely live even in the
[55:08] garden God being a God of a morphing
[55:12] stood there as the Tree of Life
[55:15] he was the only tree that had life there
[55:20] was no other tree that had the life of
[55:23] God is that right
[55:25] come on somebody even then who's the
[55:29] tree of life now Jesus Christ says he is
[55:34] the tree of life he's the bread of life
[55:38] he's everything he is life why are you
[55:43] saying this because people they get in
[55:49] traditional things and they actually
[55:52] think that they're saved because they
[55:55] believe in a prophet you need to believe
[56:00] in a prophet but you're not saved
[56:04] you only saved by the blood of the lamb
[56:09] brother Branham was the only one that
[56:11] God he used an hour a day to bring us
[56:14] the real sacrifice
[56:16] well somebody help me that was fresh
[56:18] from heaven hallelujah yes ah when that
[56:23] showdown came hallelujah it was a bear
[56:26] worshiping and in a job it was Elijah
[56:29] that restored relationship it was real
[56:33] Elijah that's restored fellowship it was
[56:36] Elijah who restored the sacrifice
[56:40] because otherwise we wouldn't have known
[56:43] we all worship the devil and didn't know
[56:47] it
[56:48] come on somebody you don't want to say
[56:51] Amen but we worship the devil because
[56:54] the only way to worship God is to
[56:56] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[56:58] if you weren't worshipping God in spirit
[57:00] and in truth
[57:01] you were worshiping the devil thinking
[57:03] you were worshiping God hard pill to
[57:07] swallow but it's true now whoo-hoo I can
[57:15] hardly take it up here brother Balaam
[57:19] said but the hour and the message God
[57:21] provided we 65 he said but the hour is
[57:25] come that every Kingdom has to give away
[57:28] because there is a king of God that
[57:32] established in the heart by the baptism
[57:36] of the Holy Spirit and the presence of
[57:38] Jesus Christ we are the only ones
[57:42] everybody else think is their church we
[57:46] know that we are the church we know that
[57:49] we are the temple of God we know that it
[57:51] is God who lives in us our worship goes
[57:55] everywhere with us no matter where we go
[57:59] we can worship God hallelujah we don't
[58:03] even have to carry a cross hallelujah
[58:06] because we worship God from where in
[58:10] this temple
[58:15] you can't ball it out of me
[58:17] that's what they thought would hey John
[58:20] we're gonna throw you in a batch of what
[58:21] we're gonna bawl this thing out of you I
[58:24] could see John having a good squealing
[58:26] that day you can chop my head off but
[58:33] it's still in there can they find the
[58:37] life of a blade of grass where is it
[58:41] located in that blade of grass it's so
[58:43] supernatural they can't find it that's
[58:47] how it is with me you can't find it but
[58:50] you can see it hallelujah
[58:52] the
[58:53] that's in me must reflect itself oh
[58:58] Carlos Allah is the truth I'm going on
[59:01] I'm trying to get somewhere because I
[59:04] want everybody to know religion it's not
[59:06] gonna see some of us done got so lazy we
[59:08] don't even care almost mr. truth people
[59:12] all over this message have got data they
[59:14] they just love the religion you know
[59:17] what I don't mean no harm but I had
[59:18] party I wouldn't I used to when I used
[59:20] to be out there in the world I enjoyed
[59:22] myself in the club I knew how to dance
[59:25] before I got here yeah I knew how to
[59:41] jump before I got in here I tell you
[59:50] what the first Holy Roller it wasn't a
[59:52] Holy Roller but the first one I ever
[59:53] seen roll was a drunkard under the
[59:59] influence of the natural wine come on
[1:00:04] somebody so you can say oh we got some
[1:00:07] they don't have no oh they had that
[1:00:09] they've done that so what is it that we
[1:00:18] must have that the world can't say they
[1:00:20] got it what is it that we must have I'm
[1:00:23] going to show you what it is let me
[1:00:25] compare something you can bring right
[1:00:27] now a flower in here that looks just
[1:00:29] exactly real y'all are seeing those
[1:00:32] flowers the manufacturers and science
[1:00:35] have come so wonderfully real with that
[1:00:37] they can make a plant look real you have
[1:00:39] to go up and touch it to make sure it's
[1:00:42] not and how do you know it's not really
[1:00:45] when you get up and you touch it you
[1:00:47] feel and you feel like oh no no no this
[1:00:48] is synthetic this is not real
[1:00:51] it cannot live though it look like it
[1:00:53] lives it's just a copy of the real thing
[1:00:56] see one thing about a plastic plant it
[1:00:59] cannot reproduce it may look real but it
[1:01:06] reproduce faster difference this message
[1:01:09] is not to reproduce numbers this message
[1:01:14] came to reproduce sons and daughters of
[1:01:17] God hallelujah it is denominations that
[1:01:22] focus on numbers a million more in 44
[1:01:25] brother man said what is that what
[1:01:29] difference does it make if you've got
[1:01:30] all these people and they're not born
[1:01:32] again if I could just stir up your
[1:01:37] hearts and minds because it's later than
[1:01:39] you think I don't know why we think God
[1:01:43] is gonna sweep us through the city oh
[1:01:45] wow I'm gonna wait on the squeeze and
[1:01:47] let me tell you something if you ain't
[1:01:48] got nothing you ain't nuttin coming out
[1:01:52] squeeze gonna only pull out something
[1:01:55] what's in you if you got the devil in
[1:01:57] you that's what's coming out if you got
[1:01:59] God in you that's what's coming out
[1:02:01] hallelujah
[1:02:03] well somebody help I'm serious I told
[1:02:08] the Lord I don't want to be preaching
[1:02:10] what everybody else is preaching making
[1:02:12] everybody shout and dance and run that's
[1:02:14] all God but at the end of the day have
[1:02:17] your lives changed are you closer to God
[1:02:20] do you read your word are you praying
[1:02:23] hallelujah y'all hear me like one
[1:02:27] brother said to me the other day he read
[1:02:29] a read whether where this author forgot
[1:02:32] who he said it was he said the church
[1:02:34] having lost their bound binding power
[1:02:39] mister truth and the only way you can
[1:02:42] bind something is that you have the
[1:02:44] power to bind it with if we have lost
[1:02:48] our binding power that means the Holy
[1:02:50] Ghost is not there
[1:02:53] it is the Holy Ghost that it arrests
[1:02:56] every demon and every devil and binds it
[1:03:01] by the authority of the word that comes
[1:03:04] through your mouth and if you have it if
[1:03:08] you're not living right it won't work
[1:03:10] for you
[1:03:14] you say I don't know about that remember
[1:03:17] brother Branham lied
[1:03:19] and he told him to tell them tell them
[1:03:22] I'm not at home and he had to go pray
[1:03:25] for that baby as soon as he went to go
[1:03:27] pray for him to God says you hypocrite
[1:03:31] and before he could pray for that with
[1:03:34] the gift the prophet with the gift of
[1:03:37] healing had to make it right before he
[1:03:42] could be effective with that child
[1:03:45] that's why a lot of prayers are not
[1:03:47] being answered it's because people lives
[1:03:49] are not right so they come to the
[1:03:51] preacher hoping that his life is right
[1:03:53] and his prayer will answer it for him
[1:03:55] get your life right and you won't need
[1:03:58] the preacher they shall lay hands on the
[1:04:02] sick and they shall recover you're
[1:04:18] enjoying this you don't because I'm
[1:04:22] trying I'm trying to tell you something

[1:05:09] control of my life take control of my
[1:05:12] tongue take control of my eyes can't
[1:05:15] take control of every attitude that
[1:05:17] would come that's not like him I'm so
[1:05:19] thankful let me hurry up right he's
[1:05:24] preparing us remember I read in the
[1:05:27] scripture no unclean thing shall enter
[1:05:30] therein that's revelation no liars
[1:05:33] no thieves who among us out wait it
[1:05:37] reading revelations even people who are
[1:05:41] fearful I heard brother ben says you got
[1:05:45] the Holy Ghost why are you afraid to use
[1:05:48] it
[1:05:50] that's what the Holy Ghost is far so
[1:05:53] that you can glorify God in your mortal
[1:05:57] body we're not here to be seen by men we
[1:06:02] want Jesus to be seen
[1:06:06] hallelujah
[1:06:07] yeah if somebody helped me here
[1:06:11] revelations 314 says and unto the Angel
[1:06:14] of the Church of the Laodiceans write us
[1:06:18] why this age these things says what the
[1:06:22] Amen every word is right the faithful
[1:06:26] and true witness huh Jesus is saying
[1:06:30] listen not only did I see him Malachi 4
[1:06:33] but he'll be faithful and I'll be true
[1:06:35] to what he says is that right anybody
[1:06:40] can tell me anything he said under the
[1:06:43] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that
[1:06:45] didn't come to pass everybody say they
[1:06:48] got something they claim they got
[1:06:49] something ain't never lie is not just
[1:06:56] that the bride for the man said the
[1:06:58] bride will be a super Church
[1:07:01] wait a minute here what's super about
[1:07:03] this hallelujah
[1:07:07] she'll be a super touch win when he
[1:07:09] takes her in the rapture ah super charge
[1:07:12] must be now brother Branham said the
[1:07:14] move is on the bride
[1:07:17] you know we've got Dayton's and chorus
[1:07:19] we got people and men who's interpreting
[1:07:22] what he says over the days of miracles
[1:07:24] are past see they don't say it like that
[1:07:26] you know what they say that's just -
[1:07:28] Pentecostal hmm that's the way they
[1:07:32] phrase it it's to pinna culture see what
[1:07:35] they're saying is that we don't want the
[1:07:37] supernatural if you don't want the
[1:07:39] supernatural you won't get to heaven
[1:07:41] there is what rapture you know of that's
[1:07:45] not supernatural
[1:07:48] even yourself how many of us could add
[1:07:51] one cubit to our statue raise your hand
[1:07:54] you can't add nothing so even your
[1:07:57] growth is by a supernatural power thank
[1:08:01] God for the seed of God that's in you
[1:08:06] the Bible says according to second
[1:08:09] Corinthians 5:17 I'm hurry therefore if
[1:08:13] any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:08:15] creature old things are passed away and
[1:08:18] behold all things have become new now
[1:08:22] I'm going to read that quote again but
[1:08:24] the hours come that every kingdom has to
[1:08:27] give away because there is a king of God
[1:08:30] that established in the human's heart by
[1:08:33] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:08:35] presence of Jesus Christ and Christ will
[1:08:38] come to his bride and we'll set up a
[1:08:41] kingdom here on earth that will never be
[1:08:45] diminished you see you see why we needed
[1:08:51] a rapture because all of those sees God
[1:08:54] brought up from the Old Testament was
[1:08:58] his seed
[1:08:59] they were thoughts in his mind they were
[1:09:02] genes of God and when he arrives they
[1:09:06] arose - hallelujah and now God is
[1:09:09] packing us away somebody help me is that
[1:09:14] right
[1:09:14] I just a 5457 whichever it is says none
[1:09:19] consider why the righteous are put to
[1:09:22] sleep but they are put to sleep because
[1:09:25] of the evil that is to come hallelujah
[1:09:29] and what is God doing storing them up is
[1:09:33] that the truth brother Branham said I
[1:09:35] went behind the curtain of time he said
[1:09:38] I saw over there millions millions and
[1:09:42] they were all running to me saying my
[1:09:46] precious brother my precious brother he
[1:09:48] said I didn't understand hallelujah why
[1:09:51] they were calling me my precious brother
[1:09:53] until one old lady 97 years old passed
[1:09:57] by hallelujah her damned
[1:10:00] lugia he said it amazed him because
[1:10:02] there was no fleshly sensation power to
[1:10:05] God hallelujah because all that there's
[1:10:08] neither male nor female hallelujah only
[1:10:10] world and that's Jesus Christ then the
[1:10:15] angel said do you remember how he said
[1:10:17] no sir say she was 97 around 97 whatever
[1:10:21] it was a man when she got saved now look
[1:10:24] at her now she was one of the most
[1:10:25] beautiful women there
[1:10:27] he said she'll never ever change I'll
[1:10:30] grow old
[1:10:31] hallelujah that's what I've been trying
[1:10:33] to tell ya she Adam came and when Adam
[1:10:37] fell we came we were born into death by
[1:10:42] way of sex we came by way of death
[1:10:45] everything gonna die hallelujah and then
[1:10:48] Jesus had to come that's why he had to
[1:10:51] be virgin born he had to bypass Joseph
[1:10:55] he had the bypass Mary and he had to
[1:10:57] make his own cedar and he had to make
[1:11:00] his own charm hallelujah it was God
[1:11:03] hallelujah what does he do it
[1:11:05] preparing for a new world hallelujah and
[1:11:09] we are here to declare his generation we
[1:11:13] are here to declare that Jesus Christ in
[1:11:17] the death burial and resurrection did it
[1:11:21] all restored everything that is fallen
[1:11:25] is that right the prophet of God said
[1:11:28] when those seals open hallelujah it put
[1:11:31] us back into Eden before the fall what
[1:11:37] was he saying when he put us back into
[1:11:40] the even before us see because once you
[1:11:42] understand this there will be no babies
[1:11:45] in the resurrection because babies came
[1:11:48] by the fall hello somebody hey man we
[1:11:54] were supposed to come by the spoken word
[1:11:58] Adam was supposed to speak at hallelujah
[1:12:01] remember that God gave Adam that
[1:12:04] Commission before he was separated they
[1:12:07] were in one body male and female they
[1:12:10] were in one body it was when God
[1:12:12] gonna amen speak it you see well how how
[1:12:15] is it happening now she can't come back
[1:12:17] void it cannot come back boy
[1:12:21] hallelujah understand Amen what God is
[1:12:24] doing he's preparing for a new world
[1:12:28] hallelujah
[1:12:29] so he had to give us a name somebody
[1:12:35] help me here he showed it brother well
[1:12:38] said if he had called and when he went
[1:12:41] to the Lazarus tomb if he would have
[1:12:42] said come fall he said the whole grave
[1:12:44] would have woke up but he said he called
[1:12:47] Lazarus by name hallelujah and the Papa
[1:12:52] said the whole family of God
[1:12:55] it's named after him hallelujah
[1:12:58] and with that Archangel called
[1:13:01] hallelujah he will call the name that
[1:13:05] would get everybody up at the same time
[1:13:08] hallelujah I don't that's what Joseph
[1:13:11] said don't bury me in Egypt bury me over
[1:13:14] there in Jerusalem barely where the
[1:13:17] resurrection will take place hallelujah
[1:13:20] that's all I'm saying don't bury me in a
[1:13:23] Methodist Church I don't want to be bad
[1:13:25] in a Pentecostal church not even
[1:13:27] lessenberry me in Jesus Christ because
[1:13:31] that is where the resurrection will take
[1:13:33] place and get me don't get me wrong I am
[1:13:42] NOT speaking against this message but
[1:13:46] when John saw Jesus he told his
[1:13:49] disciples followed him
[1:13:53] hallelujah he said I must decrease and
[1:13:57] he must increase is that right what do
[1:14:01] you think this picture was it meant I
[1:14:03] don't have it up but the angels Sabbath
[1:14:05] he knew he'd come to me when the
[1:14:07] thunders roared and and the seals were
[1:14:09] opening and we saw the hobbling head of
[1:14:12] Christ what was brother Branham he said
[1:14:16] that picture he said that's my lord
[1:14:20] that's what he said that's a picture of
[1:14:23] my lock on him
[1:14:25] so he wasn't pointing at himself he said
[1:14:28] that's my lord and even was brother
[1:14:31] branham's Lord is my lord hallelujah
[1:14:33] y'all understand what I'm saying he was
[1:14:36] pointing us to the bloody bleeding world
[1:14:39] of this message it is the only place of
[1:14:42] God's worship and where God will accept
[1:14:46] it I don't mean to scream I can't get it
[1:14:50] I can't help it I get too excited I know
[1:14:53] I do I try to calm it down the other day
[1:14:55] I was preaching I'm jumping and running
[1:14:57] everything else I forgot I was 63 till I
[1:15:02] got back home and took two days to
[1:15:04] recuperate you know we must understand
[1:15:08] you know I can understand when Elijah
[1:15:11] saw that saw that rain getting ready to
[1:15:12] come the bow ad out run ran the chariot
[1:15:17] old man was quick on the hallelujah
[1:15:19] that's how the power does that quick new
[1:15:21] power causing you to do things that are
[1:15:24] supernaturally done
[1:15:28] is this okay
[1:15:29] can I read one more scripture so
[1:15:32] Galatians says 6:15 says for in Christ
[1:15:36] Jesus neither circumcision availeth
[1:15:38] anything nor uncircumcision but a new
[1:15:42] creature
[1:15:44] now i'ma tell you this message is
[1:15:47] supposed to produce new creatures not
[1:15:52] some patched up y'all understand me I'm
[1:15:57] gonna tell you what the devil was doing
[1:15:58] with me I could preach message this here
[1:16:01] and you know enjoying myself and the
[1:16:04] devil coming right back after this
[1:16:06] message and try to make me think you're
[1:16:09] not that you understand me and I was in
[1:16:13] other words he would question you and
[1:16:14] may try to make me question my faith in
[1:16:18] Christ and God told me to stop doing
[1:16:21] that it's not if it's going to happen
[1:16:24] it's already happening see the
[1:16:28] resurrection has already accomplished
[1:16:30] what you and I want to accomplish if we
[1:16:33] put our lives in Jesus Christ and I
[1:16:37] trust in here
[1:16:38] he that begun the good work is faithful
[1:16:41] to complete it he will complete the work
[1:16:43] in you but you must identify yourself
[1:16:48] with your sacrifice and that sacrifices
[1:16:51] Jesus Christ himself whew I'm feeling
[1:16:57] pretty good
[1:16:58] hmm brother Bentham says in faith once
[1:17:04] delivered to the Saints I'm closing and
[1:17:06] I've picked up this evening he said you
[1:17:09] better take what the Bible says you got
[1:17:13] to be born again not mystical think
[1:17:17] you're born again but when the Spirit of
[1:17:20] God absolutely kills everything in the
[1:17:24] world in you and you become regenerated
[1:17:28] a new creature in Christ then you know
[1:17:32] the old things has passed away if you
[1:17:36] still love the world or the things of
[1:17:39] the world the Bible says the love of God
[1:17:42] is not even in you I mean he said that's
[1:17:46] plain but brother is not white white
[1:17:49] wash is wash you white that's right hmm
[1:17:54] listen let me go on he said when the
[1:17:58] great body we're not to be conformed to
[1:18:01] this world but be transformed the body
[1:18:04] of Christ is a new creature and when all
[1:18:08] things are passed away and the world has
[1:18:10] went out of you then we become new
[1:18:13] creatures in Christ
[1:18:15] our whole affection is on one thing all
[1:18:18] things above then we look to Christ we
[1:18:21] look not at the things of this world so
[1:18:25] i'ma tell you when I was in the world I
[1:18:28] used to drink I had a habit and when God
[1:18:31] delivered me from that you don't see me
[1:18:35] thirsting for alcohol anymore
[1:18:38] hello ah and I didn't go through no DTS
[1:18:45] is that what they call it detoxing
[1:18:49] mm-hmm
[1:18:51] nothing shook I didn't know when God
[1:18:56] took it he took it hello come on
[1:19:01] somebody when God takes something from
[1:19:03] you he takes it and change that when he
[1:19:06] takes it he takes a desire so when he
[1:19:09] takes the desire from you you don't have
[1:19:10] to worry about it anymore but as long as
[1:19:15] the desire is there that means God still
[1:19:17] got work to do
[1:19:21] smoking - God can take you away from
[1:19:25] cigarettes just like that you don't have
[1:19:29] to go through a program if you go
[1:19:32] through God's program here clean it up
[1:19:34] one time it ain't not for demons once
[1:19:39] you cast the demons how you free oh come
[1:19:42] on somebody God can take it it doesn't
[1:19:51] take away the temptation but he can take
[1:19:53] the last from out of you
[1:19:54] Oh somebody help me here hmm I'm dealing
[1:20:01] with natural things this is all these
[1:20:03] things got to go alright guy said motor
[1:20:06] preach on this but I do it this evening
[1:20:07] but let me tell you something brother
[1:20:09] branham said that the world go through
[1:20:12] the same process that we must go through
[1:20:17] he said the world went through
[1:20:19] justification on the Noah sanctification
[1:20:21] under Jesus and it's looking and waiting
[1:20:24] right now for its fire baptism
[1:20:27] hallelujah
[1:20:28] he said in that fire baptism will burn
[1:20:31] all the demons away from you Holly Luke
[1:20:34] that's what that's why the devil said we
[1:20:36] see I'm in the message I'm not right you
[1:20:37] know I've I believe God sent a prophet
[1:20:39] millions believed the same thing and
[1:20:40] they died in the wilderness right Amen
[1:20:43] they saw the pit oh I saw the pillar
[1:20:45] fire I got him on the picture that don't
[1:20:47] mean a thing millions even unbelievers
[1:20:48] saw the pillar fire you said oh I saw
[1:20:51] Jesus and he walked by me let me tell
[1:20:54] you what five hundred the Bible says in
[1:20:56] the New Testament so Jesus after the
[1:20:59] resurrection didn't even show up at the
[1:21:01] at the upper room
[1:21:04] people who saw seeing him don't mean
[1:21:07] nothing if you don't do nothing
[1:21:09] Jerry its servant went to get Jesus my
[1:21:15] master won't you and instead of taking
[1:21:18] care of his own business he just took
[1:21:21] him he was in the face of Jesus a lot of
[1:21:25] people right there in the face of Jesus
[1:21:26] they won't do nothing Christ comes right
[1:21:30] in the church with the unknown thing and
[1:21:32] you waiting on somebody else to move
[1:21:33] don't be foolish when God touches your
[1:21:38] heart move hallelujah
[1:21:41] don't be afraid to worship don't be
[1:21:43] afraid to praise Him
[1:21:44] don't be afraid to cry don't be afraid
[1:21:47] to weep
[1:21:48] whatever he's moving on you to do do it
[1:21:51] anyway we too starchy so starchy music
[1:22:00] is not only thing that makes me excited
[1:22:02] the world makes me excited hallelujah
[1:22:05] and you and I must understand and then
[1:22:08] it doesn't matter how long you've been
[1:22:09] in the message it doesn't matter I'm
[1:22:11] trying to tell you all something you
[1:22:12] think God let me say it like this you
[1:22:14] ask God go home and ask him why he sent
[1:22:17] you here why are you here if God did not
[1:22:20] send you here to hear the preaching
[1:22:22] that's coming from me why are you here
[1:22:25] why there's a purpose for you being here
[1:22:29] you could have been somewhere else this
[1:22:34] word is for you whether you believe it
[1:22:36] or not it's for you and me
[1:22:39] God is anointing me to preach to you and
[1:22:42] you got sitting there like I got it I
[1:22:44] got it all together you ain't got it all
[1:22:50] together we need change
[1:22:53] from the pulpit all the way back we need
[1:22:56] change I'm crying out every day for a
[1:23:00] revival in this place but I can't bring
[1:23:02] the revival brother man said a pastor
[1:23:04] cannot bring the revival it takes two
[1:23:07] people if we want to revival we need to
[1:23:10] cry out
[1:23:11] they get a one man thing all of us need
[1:23:14] to get on our knees and say God's in the
[1:23:16] revival I don't know about you I need
[1:23:18] more of him God didn't send you here
[1:23:24] just to just just to make you think that
[1:23:26] you go I'm gonna teach him I got it I'm
[1:23:37] gonna tell you this no I better not
[1:23:39] but you know what i'ma read description
[1:23:45] of my clothes until this evening I'm
[1:23:48] gonna come from Judah because I want you
[1:23:51] to understand when the absence of the
[1:23:53] whole you know what happens when oxygen
[1:23:55] is taken out of the water it becomes a
[1:24:00] cesspool it becomes something where all
[1:24:04] of the creeping things bacteria and
[1:24:07] everything and just settle in there and
[1:24:08] have a real revival that's that's what
[1:24:12] cancer is cancer is a cesspool somewhere
[1:24:15] in your body the oxygen has been shut
[1:24:19] off
[1:24:21] and so demons can live in it real oxygen
[1:24:28] is that one of the things that they they
[1:24:29] afraid that once people one won't
[1:24:31] understand that that you know it's like
[1:24:33] it's like you you are unstopping us a
[1:24:35] stream that has been blocked when life
[1:24:38] can flow and you got to understand if
[1:24:46] the Holy Spirit if we allow it we don't
[1:24:48] know if we don't welcome the Holy Spirit
[1:24:50] here so timid he will go and not come
[1:24:52] again brother BAM said it's so easy to
[1:24:55] grieve him and if you don't know welcome
[1:24:59] the anointing here leaving purpose do
[1:25:02] you understand what that means
[1:25:04] we won't God we want the anointing here
[1:25:09] without that we're just like everybody
[1:25:12] else with just a church with just a
[1:25:13] shell but we want the expression of God
[1:25:17] we won't listen I don't know what other
[1:25:19] people say oh we don't need to give I
[1:25:20] want all of them I want every gift that
[1:25:24] God
[1:25:24] has to put in this church I want them
[1:25:28] hallelujah uh-oh
[1:25:31] you know we fight over tongues and it's
[1:25:33] the least of the gifts but I still want
[1:25:36] it it's mine
[1:25:39] interpretation it's mine I won't I will
[1:25:42] see God I want a New Testament church
[1:25:45] y'all hear me
[1:25:47] I want to church they could say we have
[1:25:49] heard the voice of Malachi 4 and we are
[1:25:52] the reflection the manifestation of his
[1:25:55] work you should believe in him brother
[1:25:58] Branham if we're not going to reflect
[1:25:59] what he preached we need to reflect what
[1:26:03] he preached i'ma say it again we need to
[1:26:07] reflect what he preached cuz what he
[1:26:11] preached was the will of God beloved
[1:26:17] when I gave all Dylan's to write unto
[1:26:19] you the common salvation it was needful
[1:26:24] for me to write unto you and exhort you
[1:26:28] that you should earnestly contend for
[1:26:31] the faith which was once delivered unto
[1:26:33] the safe and that's what I'm doing
[1:26:37] fighting for word because I can see that
[1:26:41] you know everywhere I go I get more and
[1:26:43] unbelievers than any right I wonder how
[1:26:50] many of y'all would have gotten out of
[1:26:52] tune with Jesus when Lazarus died he got
[1:26:58] sick and Mary and Martha went running to
[1:27:00] Jesus they went and sit messengers come
[1:27:04] he's literally sick he's sick he's sick
[1:27:06] now he's dead and you don't seen Jesus
[1:27:10] work for other people like Mary and
[1:27:13] Martha they don't see what Jesus could
[1:27:14] do and yet he let my brother die see
[1:27:17] that's what people don't understand God
[1:27:19] is God he does what he wants to do and
[1:27:24] the Bible says and all things give
[1:27:26] things hmmm
[1:27:30] hello
[1:27:43] one of these old days we'll see I would
[1:27:46] therefore put you in remembrance though
[1:27:48] you once knew this how that the Lord
[1:27:51] having saved the people out of the land
[1:27:53] of Egypt
[1:27:55] afterwards destroyed them that believed
[1:27:57] not hello.c one thing for certain I'm
[1:28:03] not the one you have to please you were
[1:28:07] here to please God and he knows if you
[1:28:10] believe and when you don't believe right
[1:28:14] so understand people of God it is a
[1:28:17] serious situation and I'm trying to help
[1:28:20] I'm trying to tell us that all these
[1:28:22] little childish things that we're still
[1:28:25] fighting over fighting about whether it
[1:28:29] be in your family outside of your family
[1:28:31] it's gonna be from somewhere where did I
[1:28:34] get these scars in the house of my
[1:28:37] friends so it's gonna be your next two

[1:28:58] right emphasis faith Smyrna virtue right
[1:29:02] every age but after every age met the
[1:29:05] criteria and understand this pride

[1:29:12] Jesus Christ come to that divine love
[1:29:14] when we hit divine love the bride will
[1:29:18] be completed resurrection is on now
[1:29:23] hallelujah you understand me the problem
[1:29:26] is we're not willing to give up our
[1:29:28] selfishness most of us we're so selfish
[1:29:30] I said that like this specially because
[1:29:32] we got rights you got rights the only
[1:29:35] right you have is the right to die and

[1:30:43] after were destroyed them why because
[1:30:45] they didn't believe we can take the land

[1:30:50] came to Joshua those two amen they come
[1:30:53] back with that report we can do it I
[1:30:55] don't care what charges are there we can
[1:30:57] take the lat and you can do it - I don't
[1:31:00] care what shape you're in you could be
[1:31:02] in a bad shape right now
[1:31:04] but God is able to clean you up and fill
[1:31:07] you with the Holy Ghost you can do it
[1:31:10] you've got a right to it hallelujah
[1:31:14] don't let the devil discourage you and
[1:31:16] make you think you can't make it you
[1:31:18] can't make it because the Prophet God
[1:31:21] said you and I we've already made it
[1:31:23] hallelujah and that's what you gotta
[1:31:25] tell the devil I've already hated I'm on
[1:31:28] my way and I'm already there don't let
[1:31:33] the devil discourage you like that
[1:31:35] hallelujah yes it's supposed to be
[1:31:38] impossible for you that's why God made
[1:31:41] it impossible for you so it can become
[1:31:44] possible for him he wants to do it
[1:31:48] hallelujah is that right every battle in
[1:31:53] rail ever had the fault was impossible
[1:31:55] every fight it was impossible for them
[1:31:57] and God purposely did it that way
[1:31:59] hallelujah he told getting you got two
[1:32:01] men in me
[1:32:02] it cut him down hallelujah and God ended
[1:32:05] up with 300 and he whipped those
[1:32:07] Philistines that's all I'm saying
[1:32:10] he makes it impossible so you can call
[1:32:12] on him it's his glory you have been
[1:32:15] designed to reflect I'm finishing the
[1:32:20] description I'm done for real and the
[1:32:22] angel would kept not their first estate
[1:32:24] but left their own habitation he have
[1:32:28] reserved it in everlasting chains under
[1:32:30] darkness unto the judgment of the great
[1:32:32] day and what are we seeing these chains
[1:32:38] just didn't start these chains are
[1:32:41] changed that were linked to these people
[1:32:44] before the foundation of the world they
[1:32:47] couldn't be nothing but what they were
[1:32:49] and what they are linked date they
[1:32:53] fought against Micah in the beginning
[1:32:57] what do you think demons are they just
[1:33:01] fallen angels who tried to rebuild
[1:33:04] that's why you got Gloria you got dating
[1:33:07] you got Cain all of those all they did
[1:33:09] was rebelled and those demons just like
[1:33:11] the Holy Ghost want to occupy you demons
[1:33:14] come is that right
[1:33:15] for the Wrentham said God the demand may
[1:33:17] die but the spirits never die and they
[1:33:20] just find bodies to occupy hallelujah
[1:33:26] I don't want nothing to occupy in my
[1:33:30] body but the Holy Ghost
[1:33:31] I don't need my spirit I need ears
[1:33:37] I don't need my ghost I just need his
[1:33:41] [Laughter]
[1:33:43] hallelujah I'm closing even as Sodom and
[1:33:46] Gomorrah and the cities about them in
[1:33:48] like manner giving themselves over to
[1:33:51] fornication did y'all hear that worth
[1:33:53] giving themselves over that means they
[1:33:55] just yield it they just kept giving
[1:33:58] giving they had to give nobody took it
[1:34:01] they gave it somebody help me nobody
[1:34:07] I hit a bell let me say it again the
[1:34:11] devil didn't take it they just kept
[1:34:13] giving it
[1:34:14] and giving it in God said stop stop stop
[1:34:17] stop and they didn't see this fall
[1:34:24] don't tell me God don't warn you giving
[1:34:33] themselves over to fornication and going
[1:34:34] after strange flesh and set forth an
[1:34:37] example suffering that's suffering the
[1:34:40] Vengeance of eternal fire and if we
[1:34:43] don't stop that nonsense don't tell me

[1:34:49] mess they do they do that and all other
[1:34:52] kind of stuff in the message they ain't

[1:35:12] care what it is whatever is wicked and
[1:35:15] evil you need to repent of it God is the
[1:35:18] only one that can change you you believe
[1:35:22] that God is the only and I know that
[1:35:25] don't tell God there was there there not

[1:35:33] me and God gonna say well when did you
[1:35:35] call when did you cry when did you ask
[1:35:39] me and I didn't help and the only thing
[1:35:44] that can stop God from helping you is
[1:35:46] your unbelief but faith of boom
