here my brother comes up right away and just starts sharing the testimonies a minute it's like the Lord heard the the Lord put it on my brother's heart and then the Lord put it on my brother's heart amen I just just goes to show that where two or three are gathered he is right here in the midst of us Amen we've entered into his presence hey man we've come into his presence with singing today amen so while he's here let's just bow our heads and approach unto Him amen Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for coming into this place Lord surely we have seen the evidence Lord of your presence you've been here Lord you've spoken with us you've touched us Lord you filled our bodies when we're sick father you've troubled our spirit you've you've healed our spirits when we were troubled Lord and you've calmed the storms father with all we yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death Lord you are with us Lord and we just want to thank you Lord so much for being mindful of us Lord and father we just lift up this service unto you father Lord just telling you to take the highest place have your seat lower be at rest Lord in this place as our as we finish out the song service Lord will praise your name father as their brother seat Steven Lord comes and brings your word father across this pulpit Lord will say yes name into it and we look forward to it Lord because it's your word father Lorna's he didn't he didn't labor to study on his own on his own on his own power Lord but he entered into your presence Lord to seek your word Lord to see what the message you had father for Lord every time your bride goes together you have a message for them father and you give your message to your dear ministry father and here's the ministry Lord ready give it out father we thank you for the process we look forward to it Lord we're we're getting ready to say yes yes name into it Lord and we Lord a mold a shape us into your image Lord we want to look just like you well we pray over the ties and the offerings as we've taken up later in the service or the pray use them for the rhythm of your gospel Lord though we'll be here a few Lord we pray Lord that as you have chosen this place to spread your message in this city Lord we will be faithful to every part of it Lord may we be your ambassadors everywhere we go I know that the whole world might know that you are the same yesterday today and forever that you still live in your people father we pray Lord you bless the people throughout the week Lord as we finish it out until the next time we gather together Lord that we'll have the testimony that God was with us all the week long and we thank you Lord for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray you know it's times like T's I don't know if you feel it but there's a sweet spirit here it's times like these it just a little bit of what it's gonna be like on the other side of the curtain I believe that mm-hmm amen okay let's sing in the name of Jesus we have the victory in the name of [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] like a brother sang this morning expect to win I love that okay as my brother gets ready here to come and give us that word let's uh let's sing the family of God because the family of God's here [Laughter] [Music] by his dog join it with Jesus as we travel I'm sure [Music] of the bamboo plant by his black Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] any other family family since I got praise the Lord it's just good it's been too long since we've been in the house the Lord that's hard to say Amen to think that you know since of God if we don't like being in church we're not gonna be like being in heaven right and so lord help us women when are this old body of ours tries to voice our voice our spirit you know it's amazing to think that we have a choice since of God to enter into the hope of joy of the world or entered into the joy of the Lord and it's amazing because I one time when I was in temptation and the Lord's I just heard the Lord say anchor into the joy of the Lord and it was just so convicting and it was like all everything just connected this all through the scripture to think that the joy of the Lord is our strength and then our ultimate reward is well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joy Lord forever and they're just all gives me goosebumps just know because I think saints of God the ultimate reward that we have is to get to the entry to the joy Oh Lord forever so to think that we choosing to enter into the joy of Lord for our strength and and for our delight that's our world daily reward amen amen praise God well I just pray that you're all rested up and ready to dive in the Word of God amen I'm just really Masjid looking for just what the Lord has for us this afternoon and so glad for the rich start us out with a testimony oh thank you in case I leave the pulpit praise God let's uh let's turn in the scripture let me get back back to where he was supposed to be here and amen praise God I also wanted to say you know I was talking to it that was it was it you were the rich we were talking about just all the different the buildings that y'all been in and just thinking about the hotel and then and then thinking about the Upper Room counting how it was it was one time that we were waiting for the lady to unlock the door to the church and tree nodding his head remembers that and we get up there and I think I could prob sometimes I felt like I could see my breath in there was that cold in the winter and I was just I was thinking oh Lord you know just to think that they were they were just just you guys are all praise in a way anyways no matter what what the cost and to think that there was a mega church oh my oh I'm not on okay thank you to think that that you know here in the midst of you know having a little corner and a mega church up in the upper room that just still satisfied - praise the Lord and preach the word and listen and and to endure 40 degrees I had to mean about 4045 degrees in there and by the end the service had probably got up to about 55 degrees so praise God we we were we were warming up with our Alexa fire amen amen praise God so enjoy the fellowship this afternoon for their brother Jim and the Troy and his family it was just good to spend time I just ice like I said before it's just it's nothing when you can't spend time with a little bit of fellowship so we want want to always I was to do that I remember when I was at Honduras on a missions trip and I just conveyed that to the church you know and I said you know there was some young young men and I said oh I just love to take you fishing I'd love to just go fishing with you and well they heard that and I got my wish more than I probably asked for cuz here we go out in a rowboat boys at way and there was seven of us in a rowboat going on in the ocean at about nine o'clock at night and we were rowing out to the ocean for a boat about 40 minutes and you know I'm thinking oh man who police if we sink we don't have life jackets wouldn't have anything you know it's just and I can't see anything in the water I could step on an urchin or huette whatever but you know we just we just endure it and we have a really good time and it was a good time of fellowship and it was just it just made me think more I'll understand more what the disciples went through a little bit on the sea so I'm just thankful for the fellowship around the world and anytime we can get a fellowship with a sense of God amen praise God amen so let's turn in our Bibles let's try um Psalms a chapter xxxiv one of my favorites oh this there's so much in this there's there there's oh we can just we get you out in one verse for a month of this one let's just start out with verse one Psalm 34 verse 1 why don't we all just let's just read it together starting in verse 1 I will bless the Lord at all times yeah let's to see you not say it out loud his praises shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name for together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all of my fears let's just ask the Lord's blessing on his word and I Heavenly Father we just thank you that we can come once again this afternoon Lord the feasts at your table Lord O Lord if you prepare a table for us in the presence of our enemies how much more Lord in the presence of brothers and sisters Lord we thank you Father for that Lord bless your word tonight Lord just may we be able to all be quickened by your Holy Spirit Lord this the seed that's going forth we just ask see be with us now in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may be seated I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears you know it's amazing how when you're when when you get to be 35 for the rich one day you'll get there that's giving no when I feel like it's Satan tries to mask you know like brother Branham says Satan doesn't change he just changes the way he comes you know and fears fears change and and how that you know it'll be just a little bit of just uh maybe just an uninsured Ness and really it comes down to fear and how that when we seek the Lord I really wanted to just preach out and I'm seeking to find to know and to be seek to find to know to be is that that we're finding rest you know we're all finding rest from everything from her from from fear from lack of peace from from the the the craziness of life I remember one time I was preaching up at Honduras I was just thankful the Lord could just provide for me to even go and it was up in the mountains drivin our drive in the mountains just beautiful the churches to a parked right on the edge of a Vista and you just look over the valleys you just think they would never have any problems here and I was praying and I just felt like the Lord's telling me preach on and quietness and confidence show me your strength and I say they don't need that they already have quietness here they don't need that and you don't hear after the service saying well yeah that was just a big struggle right you know for them housing for them wow what is it for us and we're we're not on the mountaintop we're not living on the mountaintop so just to know that that when we seek the Lord we have we have that rest where that piece you know be still and know that I am God and you even get to that point of stillness is seeking right what is it what does it mean the main goal of our lives is to know him and to be known of him right the Lord Lord I've done all these things in your name I never been depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you so it's that seeking and did to get ahead of myself it's what's so wonderful about seeking the Lord is we have the best example of what seeking should look like because he sought us first right and so what out what a wonderful beautiful Savior we have that sought us out and so that we could see that example that as David said in Psalms 139 well though I made my bed in hell you're there with me and you know how hard it is when you're following a loved one into the hell of their lives and how uncomfortable it is to seek after them and to think wow the Lord did that for us and oh we have the benefit that we're when we seek after him it's only the uncomfortability of our flesh that we have to deal with rather than that we are are going into a place that is uncomfortably bad it's a it's such an uplifting and just like I've heard some some old gospel singers say he's been better to us than we've been to ourselves amen well my favorite scripture verses Psalm 17 15 I I will see your face in righteousness I will be satisfied when I awake with eye likeness and I will hold thy face and righteousness excuse me I will be satisfied when I awake with eye likeness and that's my heart and I know that's each one of your heart tonight it's to one day we'll wake up and instead of looking in the mirror and it would just say oh dear there is Stephen again well praise God I'm a son of God on the inside to say will awake with his likeness amen him all that he is his kingdom his laws his commandments his precepts as judgments everything of his likeness Amon gallo Sevilla Keith did you are seeking to find and to know and to be we know it's not of works are seeking lest any man should boast but it's a but it also says ask seek knock write and you shall find so it's this it how how do we do this because again it's works versus faith right but yet it's interesting because we if we can dive into the meanings of things um seek as Darach and in the Hebrew and it because and first you need eyes to see so it's there's um there's an also word means it means to gaze upon her to be seen to appear then you need light to make things visible so you notice how even in Genesis when in order for us to even see him just the beauty of everything was was played out in exact the right order I'm even him ordering everything to be made the first thing he did or if he said let there be God and we would say ok I can't see a thing I can't see my hand in front of my face where are you we would we wouldn't know where he was so the first thing he did was say let there be light and so that that we could see the first thing is that manifestation of him as light and it's and so to think that he put himself there so we can be seen and I always like to break it up you know let which is we were talking about this little means to not prevent her forbid there you know on space time and matter be exist light God and everything that is him and so and then you need and you need light to make things visible so we can't see the invisible God without his light you know spiritually I mean I we could say but then also to think that you know isn't it and how this the sunlight actually lit physical little manifested the Sun and the light in the light of the eye so when you know how to think that you know again this is God it's a great drama so he's he's doing the set design he's doing the lighting and he's he's putting him right there for us is that he he's I'm sorry I'm just trying to get my thoughts together please forgive me is that everything thought out the word even in seeking is the word behold just like David said in Psalm 17 is that ever thought about that is like what we look at is what would become so you think well seeking isn't is just digging in the dirt for nuggets but even thinking about that we're we're beholding his face you know just like we were talking about in this room this morning David said you know the Lord said unto me seek my face and and I said unto Him Lord I fit my thy face I will seek and it's interesting that there's the beholding that beholding cuz you think about what is it what are the two words there be which is exist and hold so we exists holding and then amazing so each one of us tonight our existing while holding what are we holding that that that treasure in earthen vessels we're holding or holding him so we're beholding him looking in it but we're also existing while holding and that wonderful justice just to see that that the part of it and in beholding leads to becoming right just like the the the name of our text to know to seek to find in to know and to be because we don't want to just know we want to we want to become so that's so wonderful as again we're how we said that will hold I face unrighteousness ugly satisfied when I wake and their likeness becoming him and and so even the thing about was becoming its its exist coming it's so it's we're coming to him and he's coming to us and it's this wonderful wonderful interaction and this in the seeking to see to see to gaze to behold to look upon you become what you behold what does it mean to seek the Lord to read your Bible pray study how long do we study for how long we pray for how long do we how long what would it take Joel to really seek the Lord is there different ways to seek Him how do we find him if we are even asking the question it brings us to more into knowing to think that we're even asking that question and I remember there was a time in my life that the Lord she would just keep saying me Stephen seek me Wally maybe he found seeking me while I may be found seek me while I may be found seek me while I may be found and I would just hear it all the time I was like all praise God because that's his he's calling so that means that he can be found and that's that's a wonderful thing we're not we're not on a wild goose chase chase like in the supermarket at Costco we have what's called the treasure hunt and if you ever go to Costco which I'm guessing you probably do you guys have a Costco around here that they always move things around so then that way you look you buy other things while you're looking for that thing and and it's called the treasure hunt but sometimes it just turns into a wild goose chase but we know with the Lord it's something that we can find every time amen let's go to Psalms 119 and let's just read a verse 2 blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart so it's it's the ship she also says he know that scripture the Sikma shall find me when they seek for me with their whole heart so to me our heart is such an interesting place because you think about it it's the it's the betting round for for whatever it is that we're or positioning yourself and how can I say this simply did you know that you're the heart is the seat it's the chair of your craving so this was your heart that this is the place where where whatever you put in that you'll crave so if all of a sudden I put in if I put in in Apple products and I put it on on the seat of my heart what am I gonna crave boys and young lady Apple products a computer products technology all of said I'm gonna crave and I mean look for everything because I've and I've done it mechanically you can do that you can like I'm Stefano's and I can't remember who else in the scripture addicted themselves to the Word of God because in and they mechanically did that so if I decided to put something else I can't believe I'm not feedback and getting feedback they're close to the but if I put the Word of God now in my heart what am I gonna crave yeah that's right and his word right how can I do that though without craving something in the beginning if I just what if I just craved air because there's nothing in there but something will always want that spot and no that's a throne it's a and it's also what's in charge so if I'm craving if I'm craving computers and gizmos and whatnot now it's going to tell me to spend my money on this right so I've had this before where I've and I hope you can learn from my mistakes is that I've spent lots of money on things that I craved that I don't want anymore and I remember I had over 300 CDs of all this contemporary Christian music that I would never listen to anymore and I was probably at 15 bucks a CD so you're looking at over over $4,000 worth of stuff where I could have just had a really nice guitar or something or a piano instead or maybe bought Bibles for for missions or something but but we but that's what your heart is it's a seat and it's a place of it's a it's a seat it's a place where where it sits tears of the whole body and as well as the tongue but then but then whatever you crave is now is now is now what you're gonna find everywhere what's you're gonna see everywhere how many has ever gotten a new vehicle before if you notice that as soon as you bought that vehicle you saw it everywhere and you're like wow everybody's just as soon as I bought that car everybody else is buying that car and yet why because now you own it and it's this ownership that now you're in the seat of that vehicle and now you see it everywhere and so now you're not even seeking it and you're finding it because of the ownership you think about that how that when we have the word of God in our heart and we have we have it on the throne of our heart all of a sudden we start seeing it and everything we and it's just so wonderful because almost like oh that makes sense and that makes sense but what if no I decided to put I decide to put you know technology in there too and and then I decided to put you know something else in there and and movies and whatnot now now I'm not gonna be able to find whether it's God's word of the Bible or not because I'm gonna be like well is it and this is where you hear conversations where it gets confusing what well it's really not a Salvation issue movies you know and I have my Bible and I have my booot movies and I have all you know all these these technology and I've got you know my all this stuff and it's not really you know and you can see there's confusion why because they have more than one thing on the seat of their heart so they're craving everything at the same time and it's it's like well those people you see in the line that the place and they have way too many options they're never going to find what they're looking for because there's too many options so I hope that's a good example of the the heart and how that it's a seed of cravings and that we're that that's why we have to keep our heart with all diligence right you know cuz Satan's gonna leave a peck Oh what's this package on my on the seat of my heart and oh you know all of a sudden some video game or something at that you know I I had a big problem with eating games when I was growing up and it was it was stealing away my soul and I finally just wrote out in a letter to the Lord I would never own a video game system because I I would just play for hours and hours sometimes you know 9 hours a day and it was it was I had made it the seat of my cravings so just just to know that we have we have our whatever we put on our heart it's like putting it on our radar all of a sudden we we hone in on those things right and so to be careful what we put in there let's go to a good example of this in process of how that works the mechanics of putting something we could say that this is delight let's just say this you think the light is not this what this it looks like if I go like this and I set this down here does that look like delight you would think it wouldn't be but what it is is we'll see it in let's turn over to Isaiah 58 because sometimes we don't feel especially when we're going through process of things we don't feel like seeking the Lord like we should perhaps sometimes I know that this was something that when the Lord was dealing with my heart where I was really coming into Christ this is something that really he just showed me and I thought oh my goodness so I was wondering like lord I want to seek you more but I don't feel like I have that want to to do it so there's something that you can do you can choose that will bring that that craving for it so if you look to that go down to the end down to verse 13 and this is this is wordy so we're kind of especially for the young people we'll just we'll just go through in simpler terms at the end but it says if they'll turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing that pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath to the delight the holy of the Lord honorable and shall honor him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words then thou shalt delight thyself from the Lord and I will cause thee to write upon the high places of the earth and feedly with the heritage of Jacob their father for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it so it's he even though you never hear the word seeking there you're you're hearing a dedication to greater to greater greater oneness and intimacy and a delight in the Lord and so if we look in verse just to break it down for the young people is it what what Isaiah the Lord is saying through Isaiah and there is he's saying if the if you turn away yourself from doing what you want to do and instead choose what God wants when shoot choose to put put what God wants before what you want then all of a sudden you'll want it and it'll be like a delight to you and you think really you can actually just choose and say Lord I just want your way but that's all that's all I want I don't I don't really love to do it yet but I do want your way and then all of a sudden then it says then then you shall delight yourself in the Lord oh wait it just said before if it says and call the Sabbath a delight like call church a delight call rest and him a delight and just start speaking it did you know you can make yourself like vegetables if you don't like vegetables you can make yourself like it so if you know grown people that I'll just say I've just never I just never liked vegetables and they still don't like vegetables because they keep telling themselves they never have liked vegetables and they keep selling themself they never liked vegetables but it's what they call it they're calling a delight or not delight and amazing so that's amazing how like there's some things that I know that lord telling us whether it's something that in our childhood like well I've always just done that because it's for my child and I don't want to give that up or oh I just you know I just had at our time a hard time you know getting into that thing in the Lord you know I just I'm really uncomfortable with that guess what 30 years later you're gonna hear over here that same person saying yeah I'm still really uncomfortable with that because they keep calling it what it is rather than what they want what they desire in their heart to be and so let's like that if we call it a delight I love going to church we're not being a hypocrite because we have a want to love going to church even if there's something that they're not saying yes let's go to church but it's amazing because did you know young people that even today my body said boy it sure would be nice to just take a nap in the pastor study and just maybe just call brother Troy and just say can we just have a church service at 5 o'clock or that lunch was something else but it sure just made me tired I think I'll just go to sleep you know I think I'd like to do that better but there's something on the inside of us that wants to call it call that no we don't we don't want to really want to do that we want to come to church and praise the Lord and hear more about him and we start calling that and we say I like doing that and one thing that I do actually for living I'm just on the side is I'm a tune pianos so but it's amazing how that Satan comes in and he does something is he takes anything that's that's righteous I'm sure for the try could she could speak better than me on this since he was it's been fresh in his heart but is that he tries to pervert it even by trying to call it over you I'll be on the way to a piano Ching I'm providing for my family I love doing this and I'll send out here you have to go to a piano tuning instead of being with your family you don't really like doing piano tuning to you I was like I know if I do wait what was that where'd that come from and I just had to say although that's an I love piano tuning what's wrong with me why am I even feeling this way is again he was trying to put that that dislike for piano tuning in my heart because he doesn't want me to be a provider for my family because he doesn't want me to be a testimony to go pray for somebody when I when I when I've got an opportunity to pray for someone who I'm tuning pianos is he's trying to he's trying to call things over us while we're all we're seeking the Lord and while we're doing the function that we're supposed to be doing not to get our topic but it's just that we have that that those things that are righteous to do in that seeking and that he's trying to bring us off-track amen and so for us to call it over our lives to say I love seeking Lord I'm preaching to me tonight Wow praise God is to say I loved spending time in prayer just to call it out call it out to to bring the mic to - it's that sacrifice of praise right it's a sacrifice um there's a there's a really good quote brother Brahma talks about he says we're kings and priests unto our God right and he says he says he says so we give our sacrifice of praise he says you say well I'm too tired he says do it anyhow he says the devil will tell you that until it takes you to hell so he'll steal tell you you're too tired to praise the Lord and he said he'll tell you that until it takes you to hell I thought wow - think that he's calling that over us as worth wanting to seek the Lord like all you're too tired he's trying to speak that over us when we're seeking Him for us to know that just that's just the devil let's turn over to Psalms 105 we're seeking the Lord right now praise God o give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people sing unto him sing psalms unto him talky of his always wonderful what wondrous works they go for the rich glory ye and his holy name let the heart of them rejoice seek the Lord let the heart let don't prevent her forbid that heart from seeking from from from rejoicing and from seeking the Lord so seen as trying to prevent or interrupt us from seeking the Lord and from rejoicing the Lord we don't rejoice in modern culture at all we don't it's-it's to unpriced it fall it's too undignified we never you know unless we're at a football game or a basketball or some kind of sport or some kind of worldly where there's stars involved and it's amazing how it's like we don't you know the word the rejoice actually means to leap for joy to think that and you notice how if you ever just love for joy just to try it you would actually feel more joy and that there's something that comes with the mecanics bringing the dynamics there's you know that there even in the the occult they can do things physically to invoke spirits and we won't get into that but to think that we can do things physically to bring down the Lord didn't have its the praise of his people and we know that prayer changes things we know that that's when we seek the Lord like I said we when we seek him with a whole heart that that we will find him another thing that I that I really want to highlight is that what Satan has done try to do it for me it do not for me for him is that to try to make what isn't the wrong meaning behind seeking the Lord the whole heart it's like oh well Steven that's going to take years you know because you have two hundred ninety seven thousand chambers in your heart and you know it's gonna work on you for both 37 38 mm somewhere on there yours and then pretty soon you're gonna build a sequel or if your whole heart verses to say Lord here's my heart in an instant and say Lord I don't want anything but what you want for me I give you my whole heart now I'm seeking you with that's seeking the Lord of your heart how long did that take boys maybe five seconds yeah there you go three seconds it's as easy as surrendering yes all the way that's it that's why it says today's the day our salvation not to this this age this eon of time is the day is the time of your salvation it's because it can happen in a decision for now and that's why how brother Graham said that there's a spirit behind there's an evil spirit behind wait just keep waiting just you know one more day and so did something the trickery is oh I want to wait I want to seek the Lord oh the Lord it's gonna take me years for for me to find you because I have to see with you from with my whole heart and I know I'm not there I'm saying yes all the way but I know I'm not there and to get us misconstrued undermine to say but we can seek the Lord right now with our whole heart just by saying Lord whatever it is in a way just take it away I don't want it and sometimes he'll take us through their prophets of that process but in that process we will continue to find him I know and even in that scripture I Lord was just when I was first really starting over with the Lord and really understanding what it means to love the Lord when I was 23 years old and he challenged me what does it mean to love you Lord and I had no idea and I just said lord I wanna know you and I said I know you I know that I love you because I'm not going to hell but how do I know you - where I can love you like what you know like brother Brown says or someone says you know even if I went to hell I'd still love you guys I don't have love for you I said Lord how do I do that and I just I just heard read your Bible and pray first thing every day okay I'll do that and it was such a challenging question of the Lord put him in heart I was just his seeking me out and so and then every day I would get up and you know I read my Bible and pray and sometimes I would do it until 4:00 o'clock and bro and the afternoon Excel put it off and I would be just miserable all day cuz I didn't get time with the Lord and it was he was starting to work in my heart just a little bit every day just at line upon line and and and but I still it was still blank words on a page Shh and I just want to say that especially for the youth but for all of us is that there's so many times where I would just read now just see how I got to start over okay again it's that seeking and then your brain just oh you know it's things to do I got a theater one on the way tomorrow and Oh what was that okay lord I got a CQ I got to know who you are so I can love you and and it's the seeking right and it's that we're it does that work but it's because it's it's something we put in our hearts right and so I remember I was living with a friend just this is all sneaky the devil is a friend of mine a brother in Christ his brother was an unbeliever he came to live with him he had brought in a TV in and when he left he left the TV so we had about three or four channels the news in a couple shows and we would just sit around and watch TV because I was already in there so why not just hit the power button and so I'm so I have TV and I have the Bible in my heart so I have these two things sitting in my heart right on the seat of my heart and I just was blank words on a page but then all of a sudden I me and Nate looked at each other we're that we're saying we're becoming TV junkie we know better than this so we just got rid of the TV and all of a sudden went from I can't hear his voice I can't read the word to all of a sudden I remember it the first thing I read were read where it was like reading it again for the first time and it was it was John chapter one and it was like it was like starting all over again and it was just reading in the beginning was the word I was thinking was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and I had that realization right there Saints I'm reading God what does that mean that means God's come becoming a part of me and it was you know 23 years old I've been the goody two-shoes at church and yet there was still iniquity in my heart there still I didn't have that love for the Lord to keep me and to have that delight in the Lord it was just all duty and the Word was God and it was I was just thinking I read a psalm 139 how great are the thoughts you think of us how great are the Sun some of them if I could number them there would be more than this and much of me a little old me that you would think of thoughts of me more than the sand I thought wow and you know my mind's imagining all the sand in the world thinking every one of those represents a thought they things towards us he was starting to knit my heart and love him and it was just those in that seeking it was just about a month and a half and all of a sudden just getting all all the other voices and the seeking began to happen and there's nothing no one can take that away from me amen Isaiah 55 verse 6 says seek the Lord while he may be found James chapter 4 verse 8 he says let's just go there James chapter 4 we're getting these nuggets word we're getting our miners hats on and we're getting our our excavation picks out and bingi in those nuggets I'm in verse 8 draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh unto you cleanse your hands you sinners purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and let your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up so you'd see that there's a there is a purging that comes with that that that's seeking because cleanse your hands you sinners it's just like when we go to the table to eat to feast at the table we cleanse our hands first because we don't want to go in there now being you know eating and now defiling ourselves while we're eating and so many people we know this in churches on these days they say you don't cleanse your hands you sinners you have to do anything you don't have to God wants you to be happy be happy rather than saying oh be afflicted and mourn and weep and let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves no it's it's it's let's have a rock concert and let's make you feel really good about yourself while we're talking about Jesus and it's there's no no wonder that they can't find the Lord because there's no they're not doing any of their prerequisites a God requires to seek the Lord they're saying you can have as many affections on the sit on the seat of the throne of your heart as much as you want and you'll still find the Lord because you said take you know what just say take me as I am Lord there's no there's no transformation it's it's some there's a Christian a contemporary rock Christian radio in her town and it's they they say you see you know encouraging music and it's safe for your kids to me when they've just even saying that on there I'm saying the world is wrong with this and rezzing they're right they're encouraging people but they're not transforming anyone it's just all encouragement it's all pound back it's it's it's giving a man a fish rather than teaching him to fish it's it's nothing that's sustainable it's you know and that's why I love what brother Paulo Fontaine says he says Christian or Christian contemporary music says Lord help me to get there help me to get there I'm not there help me to get there and Bride music says I'm already there so we see that we want to have that heart of it now that we've we've mourn and I've been afflicted and and in that seeking and humbling ourselves and he shall lift you up and Norma's notice the pre-law Saints have got it you see that is in verse 10 he shall lift you up remember in Isaiah 58 or did it say there I will cause you to ride upon the high places of there for the mouth do you know the boys what that means and Lydia is that in in the land where Isaiah was from there was these leaves I can remember that if there is I've X or what but they would they were little antelope like creatures and they would they would live like up on the top of the mountains and God made their feet so special that they can they can their hubs are like rock-climber hubs and and they can they can just climb up the sides Mountain maybe you mom and dad can look it up but they can they can go from the the base where they actually have to come down to drink water and and to find grass to eat but then when they see when the enemy is coming and for them they just run up to the mountain and no animal can follow in there because it's just steep cliffs so they just actually go back and forth read read read read read read they go all the way up to the top of the mountain and they can just prance all the way up and just be and gonna be completely fine because they are equipped to be able to get up there and away from the enemy and now to be able to be right on the high places of the earth and it's something that God has equipped them with and how that when we have the right equipment that God gives us you can keep us away from the snare of the Fowler and it be kept from all that and our enemies and bring us up into a high safe place away from that and isn't amazing how the seeking the Lord actually has has a it's like a side effect of all of a sudden we get lost in him and all of a sudden now we don't we don't have all the even though there that enemy is following us pretty soon they can't find our address they can't get to us because we're so we're so buried in Christ that that just like you know program says you can't you can kick a dance get take a dead man all you want to but he's not gonna do anything because we're we're dead to this world and so that we're bury our life is hid with Christ in God and so that you know that that how many of those wolves could be snapping and snarling at the base that Mon and they're on top of the moment they can't even hear the wolf anymore because they're safe amen that he'll lift us up amen Psalms 27 one thing have I desired a Lord that will I seek after that I may do well in the house Lord all the days of my life - what again behold - seek to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple I'm just going to go through a few of these you know how to turn that if you don't want to uh second chronicles 7:14 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves once again and and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land hear from heaven forgive their sin and heal their land I think it's interesting that we have Facebook these days because the Lord said seek my face and the world is setting up you can see everyone else's face will give you me will even call it Facebook rather than rather than seeking his face book amen it's it's it's amazing Hall sometimes it becomes so obvious when it's just this it's this this time and it's amazing it's a trap it's such a trap and you yet you notice how it swims right there's evil who else is seeking first Peter 5:8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh above seeking whom he may devour so he's also seeking to so as amazing gods in seeking again like that for that seat of craving a seat of affections is that in then Satan seeking who one is the one is to lift us up and one is to devour us just like those wolves at the bottom of the mountain so that's why we have to be veg so vigilant Psalms chapter 10 verse for the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God God is not in all his thoughts wow that just it struck me I never read that before really I never really read it to think that you and you have the righteous and you have the wicked right and the wicked will through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God I will say pride is God repellant because he OCE you see what does it say Oh God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble and then it's that pride is God resistant Psalms 40 verse 14 let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and be put to shame that wish me evil was John chapter 10 so I wanted to-- to write over that last one is you see again that david is acknowledging those that are seeking seeking after his soul to do what to destroy it so let's imagine that one you put you put this you put the lord and the word on on your heart and it comes as beautiful birth of becoming and and this beautiful beholding the beauty of the lord and and and awaking in his likeness versus this destroyer when he seeks after us that it just it's just to make us completely utterly in chains and to end thereof is completely destroyed utterly for us to be so vigilant that we that he doesn't come in to destroy us John chapter 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly why did God want to be sought after why did God make it a seeking thing what if he just said this everything who I am and he crossed the sky instead of clouds was everything who God is and you could just look and you could just point and then be like magnifying and then and everything of God was there all his attributes you could see in 3d you see everything and just perfectly just like golden nuggets and jewels and and just beautiful everything it was right there all the time every day and the reason why is that when there's no seeking there's no perceived value and he knew that we really like that there's no craving to know there's that when a thing is sought after it becomes a higher value to us it's where Steve yet we value it so much higher when it's harder to find there's more value when it's more rare it's more value so you think about the times up sometimes it's rare in our lives where we see we have that was just wonderful nuggets all of a sudden you know like we're just trying to understand something and then all of a sudden oh there it is and go oh I struck a nugget I was hitting earth which you know the world the world the world I'm just trying to get everything out of the way and everything just get all the the worldly dirt out of the way and all of a sudden we find that one nugget and we just say oh there's that gold not have struck gold where as if it was all gold we just be like well where's the other stuff yeah it will just be all just just excavation product wouldn't be anything to us but because it's hard to find then it's a more value and and when we have to give up everything you heard about people who have the gold rush of 18-49 and people would move all the way across the country you know on on a mule or on a horse and they'd be right all the way and so many people didn't even make it and they get there and they don't find anything and they were the reason why California became so big and so huge as you read history is because of all the the history of people looking for that goal to strike it big but to think that because it it was hard to find it became so much more valuable we look in the examples in scripture the Wiseman sought for Jesus was it wasn't it about three years three and a half years that they sought they saw the star in the east and they they travel and he traveled and then and they they finally got to him but they haven't been to ask around and then look it wasn't just that you know they were looking at the star and all something here baby crying and all of a sudden oh well it was on our own backyard well let's you know let's have a barbecue no it was something that they were looking for and seeking it was a high value to them what about people in the Bible that partially seek God do you remember anybody in the Bible young people that that partially sought God but didn't really seek him with her whole heart what about the what about the rich young ruler remember he went to see Jesus and he saw Jesus and he said good teacher what must I do to be saved because he wanted to be saved and he said go so all you have and give it to the poor and your shell of riches in heaven and he wouldn't he wouldn't seek any farther he stopped right there why remember this the chair he had treasures in his heart and and maybe he had the the commands because he says I made all the command and so he had the commandments and his treasure and said he'd give up your treasure and you can have everything it was that was the one thing in his heart that he had to give up and he says and what does the scripture say it sat on him because he had much much wealth and so he stopped his seeking right there it's whenever God pulls on your heart and you're just oh but ooh such and such as coming under burro I was I went to camp one year and it was you know there singing I surrender all and I'm standing there I'm like but that movie is coming out in two weeks that I really want to see eyes I can't surrender and it was I almost stopped and I said god I don't want and seaton would come along and say well what are you gonna do tomorrow when you know you're not gonna feel like serving God and I wanted God so bad but I said you know the Lord just show me Steven don't worry about tomorrow sufficient of the day is the evil thereof say yes today and I'll take care of you tomorrow so now that so so we don't see him with that partial heart amen what time to be surprised start at 3:00 how am i doing on time am i right okay praise God Jeremiah 29:13 and ye shall seek me and find me when you show search for me with your heart aim in you ever notice the the the epiphany or the the para mountainous of a prospector for the gym you see you'd like that they almost Pitta mies is this crazy old prospector and I want you to see the type as you see this create he's he's digging for gold and he finds nothing for 20 years and he says he comes back into town for what more supplies and easily he's he's covered in dirt what is he covered in the signs of seeking and you look at him and and he's he's got he's got old glasses because he wants to make sure you could see and he's been looking encouraging for to try to find the gold down there he's probably got so much sand in his eyes he had to wear glasses and now his kids and glasses are covered in dirt and he's he's got dirt in his beard he got dirt everywhere and he's coming back into town and everybody laughs at him and he's but yet he's coming into town to to just do one thing to get more prospecting materials and more blasting dynamite and so he can get back out to his dig because he's digging for gold and he just he just has something deep calling into the deep on the inside to find that gold and his you'll find that his life is wrapped up in his treasure and he he smells like seeking he's sweat and dirt and maybe a little gold dust on his clothes and you look at that and I say lord I pray that people would see in me the viable prospector a Jesus prospector they'd say Oh what in the world is he doing in there he what is he doing and oh I'm reading my Bible I'm enjoying the Word of God you want to sit down with me you know but for different than a prospector that we're finding gold every day but we're seeking Him and we're seeking him or finding him and our life has wrapped around that seeking seeking to know him and seeking to be known of him well what is a prospect you know people what is a prospector where on his head a helmet and then what's on the front of his helmet usually a light bulb and remember that thy word is a lamp unto my feet a light unto my path and so we have their word we're seeking him and so when I always I was and I heard this from Dwight annuity he says when you go up he says when I get on my knees he says I grabbed my Bible and he says and I get on my knees with my Bible and I get a notebook and I find the will of the Lord and so that in that seeking it wasn't just this picture of of just someone alone just like this yes it's not just what the pictures say is that that word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path so in that seeking this is our prospecting light and that we're it's it's as our we walk forward in this life and our decisions and we're seeking him saying lord I want to know where you want me to go well right there I remember had a lady but working and she was just not doing good things at work and I thought man I should probably tell someone tell my boss about her you know I just went to proverbs and it says discover not a servant to their master I said okay Lord but it was light unto my path because I was wondering should I take this path to tell to tell uh my my coworker and also my turn to don't tell on her and she ended up getting leave they let go or she she let herself go so it just the Lord just gave me wisdom so again a light on her path for our path amen praise God and yep we can't we can't talk about seeking until we talk about faith because we're seeing into the unseen right if we you notice how some people seek the Lord only in the scene and then as soon as the their first trial and the Lord pulls back from their life Lord where are you I can't see you anywhere my life forget it I give up I can't seek you I can't even find you I had a friend that I worked with and that's coming to find out that's why he left Christianity because he kind of got on the world a little bit and kind of went back to trying to seek the Lord uh he says I didn't really hurt anything I didn't see anything and that's when I started to look into evolution and I thought I was okay and I was able to witness to him and give him a Bible and but it was interesting as he was looking for a tangible God in that moment and he didn't find him so then he didn't seek him anymore and so for us to realize that we have to look through the eyes of faith when we seek Him it's that it's it's in faith that we seek Him and that it that because with all of faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is how can we seek Him if we don't know that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him hey man I just want to read that one more time Hebrews 11:6 but with all faith it's impossible to please him we always hear that part but for him that cometh to God again that becoming must believe that he is not was there will be only but that he is right now showing himself to us and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen you know the tool of diligence in delighting to do something it's amazing how that do you think about diligence I love all the word delight at diligence because what what is it about if you if you look D and light D actually means another word for D actually means pull from draw from and then light so we're actually pulling from light when we when we when we when we delight ourselves on the Lord we're pulling light from the Lord and that wonderful we're pulling on him and that it's as I think that's so wonderful we're diligence we always thought of diligence which is hard-working man and just he used to you know brunch it and he worked and he rented and they came home but it's it actually has a connotation of loving work loving to do something diligent to clean the bathroom could be just enjoying enjoying hard work to clean the bathroom rather than just in the end for us to keep our heart with all diligence it doesn't mean oh I got to do this because God wants me to do this I got to keep no nothing else on my heart no it means I really love keeping this heart clean and ready for the Lord and to keep that board in there I just love this and for us to come into church and delight and being in church we're saying I just love this it's something that whit's is treasure to us part of me I hope this is all right saints of God because I was talking for the blot saying he was saying you know we should enjoy ourselves in church you know this is a time of just of and just enjoyment to be able to enjoy our time in church and lastly in closing Christ our example again you saw us first why just show us it's not us and our works in that sorry excuse me to show us it's not us and that our works that brings us into salvation but His mercy and grace and all his credit all the credit belongs to him it also gives us the love crave to reciprocate the seeking because why don't we sing the song we so we it's his love and makes us love him back and it delighted him as we see in the Psalms 139 again you look at that seeking chapter it's all about Christ his thoughts of us and his seeking after us no matter where we go he found us amen amen praise God Amen well I hope that's a blessing to you tonight i I just love this because you know when we seek for something and I love it that when God has an answer right away and we're not when I'm in that moment sometimes it's not all of it I'm sure each one of you could say that like the Lord why why is this happening and yet when we can wait when you have that moment of waiting and have that season of waiting and then he gives us the answer it's just oh that's wonderful and now that I'm a parent I completely understand if I give everything to leave iron Hosanna right away they just ask for something else right away and then would be always and why can't we end them complaining and they were just be constant complaining and why can't have everything all the time every every time you I asked for it immediately within a second and that and and then it comes this entitlement to like why doesn't God give me something in 2 seconds and and verses just say dad knows I'm Way and dad knows I asked I don't know do it and then I want to do it more for him right there so for us to be able to come to the Lord and say Lord I've asked you I know you'll do it I'm resting in that and there's that's that's the wonderful part because you can see that some of the delights in the Lord that's faith that he is and that he heat that we trust him amen amen praise God why don't we sing a song do you guys know that song some trust in chariots we trust in the name of the Lord our God oh this is such a good song for the rich you're gonna help me I'm not sure if y'all know this but we'll give it a try it goes some trust in chariots we trust in the name of the Lord our God oh dear now I don't know the verse I'm a piano player and not a song leader and sometimes but the course goes we trust in the name of the Lord our God again what should we trust we trust in the name of the Lord our God his love never fails his love never fails his ways always will prevail his ways we always will prevail we trust in the name of the Lord our God we trust in the name of the Lord our God again we trust in the name of the Lord our God his love never fails his ways will always prevail we trust in the name of the Lord our God one more time we trust in the name of the Lord our God we trust in the name of the Lord our God his love never fails his love never fails his ways always will its ways I will always prevail we trust in the name of the Lord our God amen we trust in the name of the Lord our God amen god bless you scenes for the rich but Shing but wasn't for the mercy the good Lord if it wasn't for the mercy of the good I wouldn't if he had not died on Calvary if he had not come about me no I wouldn't be here today anyway let's go ahead and [Music] all I want to do is love you [Music] the prize every dancer on that cross [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for you and me for us [Music] [Music] let's just sing give
