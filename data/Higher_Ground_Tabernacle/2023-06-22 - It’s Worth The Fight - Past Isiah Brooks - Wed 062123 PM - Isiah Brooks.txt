surely God is good to us God has been inspiring me uh through the songs and everything I don't know whether or not our precious brother Samuel knew where I was going one of the scriptures that I'm going to read is Isaiah 54. and we'll read the I think I got that right 17th verse and from there we'll ask that you turn with us to Exodus 15. Isaiah 54 17. no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage you remember I touched on the Heritage the other day this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me says the Lord should I read that one again no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord let us go to Exodus 15. Exodus 15. we're going to read from the first to the 12th verse are you there then saying Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying saying I was seeing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea amen the Lord is my strength and song he has become my salvation now watch what he says what Moses says under this inspiration he is my God and I will prepare him and habitation I'ma say that again he is my God and I will prepare him in habitation my father's God and I will exalt him now in just a few words so much was said there basically Moses is saying I am going to prepare him a habitation and you got to understand he's not talking about a house all right he's talking about himself and he's exalting not only a God but his father's God meaning that there is no change the same God his father's served he's serving this is why Hebrews 13 and 8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever we're not serving a different God we're serving the same God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name remember that every time you go through a battle remember the Lord is a man of war Hallelujah Pharaoh chariots and his host has he cast into the sea his chosen captains also drowned in the Red Sea The Depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone the right thy right hand O Lord has become glorious in power thy right hand O Lord have dashed in pieces the enemy I want you to take inventory because he's he's literally going through something here so that you your heart and mind could be impressed he's exalting God and he wants you to understand what God is capable of doing not only what he's capable of doing but what he's already done The Depths have covered them they sank it to the bottom as a stone thy right hand O Lord It's become glorious in power thy right hand O Lord have dashed in pieces the enemy let me ask you something what is the right hand of God who is the right hand of God okay Christ was always there called the right hand of God and in the greatness of thine ecclesi thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sent it forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together at the flood stood upright as a heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said I will pursue now what he's saying is whatever God did he dried up the mud they were not walking through mud it congealed it became solid and they walked across on dry land that's the word the enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will divide the spoil now listen the enemy is boasting against God when it comes to your life he's boasting against God he may have you in a disarray right sometimes you know we we get to a state of confusion but never despair amen that's right we always have hope and faith is always there for us my lust shall be satisfied upon them I will I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them doubt it blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as the lead as the lead in The Mighty Waters who is likened to thee O Lord now he's telling the story and he's telling us he's now he comes to the point says who is liking in other words who can challenge you who can defeat you oh Lord amongst the gods who like thee who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders thou stretched out thy right hand the Earth swallowed them now let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us surely there is no God Like You Lord and I love you Lord and I thank you for the victory in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I entitled this message it's worth the fight I know that sounds so you know but it's simple but yet it's powerful it fits for this moment I was thinking about how God is doing a great thing and in in all of this battling that Moses had going through a prophecy come out our word of Prophecy I would prepare him a tabernacle see because in that day God was with them but in this this this this this day God is in US so the Tabernacle is being prepared right now and you and I must understand what we're being prepared for we're being prepared for war and God Amen knows exactly what he's doing he knows by God's grace that he has chosen the people that won't turn back amen amen no matter what you see the the test of the Bride has not yet come we think that these little things that we're going through is tough but the greatest of tests will soon be presented to us and when it comes you will have to make a decision amen whether God is still God and listen when it comes to the battle Satan always look like he has the upper hand God always use the few we're Satan uses majority but one man in his hand could put a thousand to flight and so you and I must understand that this whole thing is getting ready to uh uh cap itself come to the crooks of the the point [Applause] the point I believe yes sir it's worth the battle I don't care what you say there's nothing in this world worth going to hell for I'm Not Afraid in that way like I said you know I was serving God is to be out of reverence and love never because we are afraid to go to hell or afraid to miss the Rapture and those kind of things that only come to your mind when you don't have a true revelation of election predestination that has not been revealed to you yet on who you are but when you come to know who you are it brings a peace it brings a satisfaction and it takes away the fear of all Satan's Army no matter how great they may seem to be never in the history of Egypt they had ever been defeated listen Egypt I read up on it they were a nation a a Empire amen for almost 2 000 years listen we've just been here for a few hundred but this was a nation that ruled the world and God took a man one man who was able to obey a man who understood the instructions of God and was not afraid he did have a moment when the enemy came in as the scripture says like a flood God lifted up a standard not the waters that was in the standard the standard was God in Moses and God said God slow Moses speak listen for you need to know today your enemies are going to be destroyed amen coming from the word of God we found out that there was such a a Dramatical thing that happened in the days of Moses till the world could never forget it I remember when I went to Egypt and they said they didn't even have a record that Moses ever existed I wanted to say but we've got evidence because of where you are today you are literally the the suffering the effects of what God did with Moses yeah we know that he was taking off the books they tried to silence him but they could not because God wrote about him a word that's eternal and even now the whole world hate this book called The Bible because they hate truth and they love lies but the Bible is the truth and the truth will always stand Hallelujah is that right it's worth the fight Moses had to go through a lot of training before God could take him to Egypt God had to beat all the world out of him Hallelujah don't get mad with God you say I want to be just like him he's got to beat all of the world out of you and how does he do that how does he how does that come by about it comes by trials fiery trials but the Bible said don't you know that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold tried in the fire you'll come out like gold you hold fast it was given see the thing about it is we fail to see God said to Moses and Joshua I've given you the land go take it see what we say oh God what do you understand what I'm saying it's your inheritance yeah amen it's your heritage that's yours he left it for you amen you say well I will I have that glorified body that's my heritage I have inherited it Hallelujah but I've got to fight for it it's not just going to drop in your lap that's not the way of God he's a man of what war and when everything is going so sweet it's so peaceful peacefully in your life know that something's wrong right because you must fight every day the Bible said put on the whole of God right that's meaning clothed in the word every day if you fail to do that you leaving Satan with a Target and he's going to take every bit of that Target he can and more like they say if you give him an inch he'll take a mile Hallelujah let's read this quote because we got to understand that here God was doing a mighty thing for for Moses thought for him you know you think about it all Israel for 400 years had not seen the move of God and here come a man and God is moving in him not just moving in him but the pillar fire is following him I mean they've never seen anybody like Moses before it makes you wonder how could people not believe but that's the same thing that's happening all day they can't believe it because they don't have nothing on the inside to believe with this is why you ought to glorify God this is why you ought to praise God because God has given you eyes to see ears to hear and are hard to believe it you were not but you believe it if I can't believe Malachi 4 how can I believe Exodus 15. amen true but I believe it there's something on the inside of me yeah believe it and what God did for Moses if necessary he can do it for me amen but everybody think it's going to come easy no it doesn't come easy and God listen this all those millions of people think about it they allow Satan to dupe them in the journey trick them in the dirt Journey they were following a prophet they were following God and a man and yet they thought they could give their own ideas to how it should be done you've never seen a sheep leading a shepherd is always the shepherd leading the Sheep but it was always these people trying to lead Moses and trying to tell Moses what to do but Moses wasn't confused he knew who his Shepherd was like we know who Our Shepherd is but Joshua was learning he learned a great deal he saw God in a man defeat the greatest nation on Earth publicized it so much so it reached Jericho and all the other you know I don't they didn't have television like we but by Word of Mouth it went all over the world what God had done for his people it brought fear on the world yeah I'm saying it brought fear on the word and when Malachi 4 was here it brought fear yes yes right now the bride is supposed to have a life that would cause fear upon all the unbelievers they're supposed to be God is supposed to be seen in US not just heard with words it's supposed to be seen by a manifestation of him we are the Tabernacle but if we're not careful we'll think of our blessings assures us of the Promised Land but look what God did for all those people he fed them even in the complaints he gave them what they wanted he gave them bread he gave them meat their clothes never wore out the shoe didn't have to buy a new pair of shoes in 40 years and yet they thought that was good enough but Joshua and Caleb had a different spirit amen amen they saw that there was someone greater than Moses you hear what I'm saying so when Moses left they just didn't faint Hallelujah no they recognized there was a progression of something happening because God called Joshua and said listen Joshua you're the next one in line [Applause] I'm taking Moses but I'm anointing you to lead my people across what happened in Joshua's Ministry and that's what happens in the message are the people that believe themselves to be Christians before they could ever cross over they had to be sanctified amen yeah You Gotta Die man you gotta cross over the Jordan hello somebody that's right that generation had to be re-synced uh recircumcised and they couldn't just call oh I'm a Jew no you had to be recircumcised there was a generation that knew nothing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah and you and I are witnesses right now there are people that has nothing to they don't know nothing about it you know we we all get confused something still thinking speaking in tongues some still think it's jumping some thinking shouting and running all of that is good but the true baptism brings you into the life of the word Hallelujah it leads you into the life of the word not for yesterday this day God doesn't change his mind about his word reading from paragraph 174 he says now listen closely now when the word tests come okay excuse me when they went over and seen the opposition so great the greatest opposition they ever seen listen to the words because what's coming to us will be the greatest opposition we've ever had oh y'all think your flesh is your greatest Opera lost in all those those are those are little little demons compared to the demons that's coming thank God for Grace huh because the prophet God said in that Supreme hour God would give us Supreme faith Hallelujah he give it to us not that we deserve it not that we earned it but his grace will bring it to us Hallelujah is that right even Moses didn't have it until God says why are you crying speak he had it but he didn't know he had it just like you got it but you don't know you got it it's going to take pressure it's going to take a squeeze it's going to bring you to an opposition a great one the greatest opposition they ever seen the amalekites was ten times their size they said we looked like grasshoppers their fences on their cities are so so wall till they can run a chariot race around it two cherries as hard as they can go around the wall see of their cities you don't understand what I'm saying even when it came to Jericho the children of Israel marching around look like little ants compared but they didn't understand who was in battle Hallelujah and the children of Israel that group of people understood who was in battle whatever Joshua say will happen if he said walk around the wall seven times we're going to walk around the wall why they believe the word of a prophet and though it whatever he said came to pass amen Hallelujah it's worth the battle those people were tired they were weary oh come on somebody a big city walking around the walls huh and then the last time walk around seven times I'll tell you what I used to jog around Gray's Lake walk around Gray's Lake I went I went to Gray's Lake what a week or so ago and I was crying Lord have mercy the first round it's been so long ago yeah I'm out of condition right my feet start hurting you know what I'm trying to say now that's nothing like Jericho with all those people making fun of you trying to break your faith destroy that's what demons do don't they when you started move moving toward God that's when the Devils attack you and they're gonna oh you're not going to make it you make too many mistakes look what you just did that ain't got nothing to do with it it's all about God Hallelujah none of us would make Heaven if we had our own righteousness now I say it like this all of us somehow during the daytime has done something wrong thank God for his grace and his Mercy hmm but God chose you Moses was a man like Elijah they were human they made mistakes Moses got upset hadn't got upset in a long time the only person that could push his button was his wife but that day everybody got on this nerve huh and instead of speaking to the Rock he smoked the rock y'all hear me think about it people God is looking for a total surrender so that kind of thing won't happen when the Great opposition comes right see Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost so when the pressure came Peter pulled out his sword and went for the head but that's not the kind of warfare we're in your walk there is not carnal amen but it's worth the fight when you know that the Holy Ghost amen is your battle ax when you know he's a captain he's called in the shots you don't have to worry about trying to understand it sometimes it'll make you do things you wouldn't even understand how you wait a minute now Lord this is a great Giant and you inspired me to go pick up five stones and a slingshot y'all understand me see reasoning when the opposition comes you can send you can't try to figure it out if God say do this you do it and he will do the rest oh my God let me hurry up oh my god listen what it says they said we look like grasshoppers they're fences or their cities are so wild till they can run a chariot race around it too chariots as hard as they can go round the wall see of their cities why they spare their Spears are way out there long they're Giants why we look like grasshoppers we we cannot we can't do it see you can't see you can't do that that negative confession and sometimes we let it slip don't we but just as let just as soon as you let it slip you gotta repent quickly repent catch that that demon before those words before it Go eternal relaxing y'all understand me because once you release it only repentance can catch it and two men stood on that word Caleb and Joshua said wait a minute you two million people shut up just a minute now a lot of times people don't like you to say shut up but that's okay sometimes it sound crude but sometimes that's the only way you can get them to shut up [Laughter] yes sir right shut up a minute we are more than able to do it see we are more than a match for them now you might not know but this message is from me what was the basing on it what what was they basing on God said I've given you the land it's yours see if they can base their salvation and their victories on God has given us a land is that right God has given you the land you don't have to worry about your theophany it's there it's waiting on you your glorified body is waiting on you God is giving you the land but you've got to fight for it oh don't worry you'll win you've been ordained to win and the Bible says no weapon formed against you Hallelujah shall prosper I don't care how many times you make mistakes you know it's going to be a strange thing when that soldier who lost his ear by the by Peter look at Peter and see him sitting up on the throne there me but no weapon formed against you you can't speak Evil all you want amen it cannot stop the true seed of God it is what it is Hallelujah and I'm accepting every bit of it I don't know how God listen I I love this portion that David says Lord deliver me from this horrible pit well God we don't know where he was what he called the horrible pitch but we know one thing God delivered him [Laughter] Hallelujah you understand me sometimes we find ourselves in some dark places but all you got to do is cry out Mercy Lord at least while we're under Mercy while Grace is being found remember that door is going to shut and we don't have long it's going to shut pretty soon because once that Council of churches begin to pressure you the door is already shut when they come out that's what brother bam said when they come against the bride or when they when they you know turn this way it's over those who are out or out and those who are in or in that's it and at that point in time and he talks about it somewhere I don't have the quote with me he said when you see the world begin to have a a Revival he said that is the time of the rapture I'm paraphrasing it but don't you see what the what the world is doing what they call a Revival there's still no Revival but it looks like it they think that's what it is it is an anointing of God but that anointing is doing something different from them for them than us amen amen Hallelujah because the tag can't be a wheat but it has to be anointed and think about it people when they are when they come together in such a unity and you says no then you're going to look like the devil is that right you said what are you talking about they did it to Jesus Jesus looked like the devil because he would not agree with the organizations of that day help us Lord Jesus let me move on what was their basing it on God said I give you that it's yours and there's there they stood but the people had gotten married off against other things all kinds of Creeds and rituals among them and they just weekly wishy-washy didn't know which a way to turn and what to do that's right there come the word test see what I'm saying what happens look at us I want you to scope it so many Creeds and dogmas and traditions among us and we call it the word and you we we we won't admit the strength is gone when serves uncompromised they took his strength and we can't we don't want to admit it we need a Revival we don't want to remit admit that somewhere we got our course and brother by Adam said how do how do you get back to Jesus you go back to where you left him amen and where did they leave Jesus at Pentecost and where do we leave him at Pentecost we had a intellectual Revival that's what we had and they took that quote where where where where brother Adam said amen that you know the Holy Ghost is is without sensation and they did the same thing the Pentecostals did with speaking in tongues they did the same thing and what did we do we killed the people we kept them from going into the holies of holies I don't care what they think of me that's the truth and until we get back to that old-time religion there's only one way I think brother said in in the rising of the Sun and one of those two Easter message or something somewhere he said there's there's only one way that that the Pentecostal Church could have babies when they go to reproduce what they're going to reproduce those hauling screaming Acts 2 38 babies that's it when the last time you've seen that help us Jesus and then when I stop preaching stuff like this they're going to tell you oh he's off the message I'm off the message and you got people they've been sitting in your church they've been thinking they're living and they're dead help us Jesus we can't be afraid of the opposition we can't your songs are at stake and you've got to seek out God until you know that you know that you know and what you say what do you mean I mean when you know you got it you can't stop amen amen you can't stop talking about him you can't stop preaching or teaching or whatever the case may be he's on your mind all the time that's the True Church of God amen we got too many things on our minds that's where we lost and Satan knows he's given us all those fillers till we don't have time to read and pray like we should huh and you know have you ever had that struggle Lord should I read or should I look at this or that and it may not even be evil but but may God help us you know that was the danger of bringing that thing and all these other things into our home because the problem that God knew it was going to distract us bring us to a state of lukewarmness oh I'm not ashamed but I was telling somebody I said I am not hot how many are hot see I'm honest I'm honest I want to be hot somewhere I've lost the Heat but I'm going to get it man I'm gonna find where I left him y'all understand me oh you say oh wow you're in the puppet oh yes the anointing is here that's him but it's out of the pulpit I'm talking about I remember when God first saved me I stand on the corners and preach scream and I buy myself I didn't care saving Souls that's all that mattered what happened oh you matured brother Brooks you call that majority that's what people say in the message when you mature you'd get dead you sit there and don't say no amen and don't say hallelujahs or nothing like that don't even smile what church is that that's not the New Testament Church and I don't care what you say I hear I hear Brother Brown I hear the word of God I know what he says and I'm looking for that he said you can't say this is that until you see that become this or this become that y'all understand me I'm not gonna lie to me this is my only opportunity this is your only opportunity y'all don't know my prayer has been I don't care what it takes to make me fired up whatever it takes God do it for me I don't care if people love me hate me I don't care I don't want to be like nobody else but Jesus yet he Grant your permission to make per to make see permit you permit your will or permission will knowing that what's in your heart he knows it you say well brother Brandon I I do so and so I don't bother it it don't bother me God blesses me every day I sing in spirit I dance in the spirit he permits It Go a bit go ahead that's right but what you're going to do I wear shorts I do this I don't bother don't it don't bother me I know my faith is in Christ not in what I wear you know that's what people I can drink I can smoke I can do this I can do that it doesn't bother me but it's wrong with people they don't even know Satan has tied them up but the Bible said there is something to do with it see what you do you make a stumbling block like Balaam did before every one of the others women what you'll do you you to your your girls you'll have a bunch of ricketters that's exactly right a bunch of little painted up Jezebel see God will prosper you why he's blessed as he's being I don't doubt that he blessed Balaam too see certainly he will you'll walk in his permission will not his perfect will God doesn't change his mind God bless God cause He blesses you doesn't mean he changed his mind he's black he's blessed Israel out there for 40 years what did they do married wives raise families kiss children paid the tithing lived right on there out there and God blessed them in the wilderness fed them with with the Manna on and on and every one of them perish because they never kept his original or permit his original will his word they took his permissive way go ahead but you remember when they left kadish they never journeyed any further they just went around and around in the wilderness where they could have been out in two days after that they could be in the promised land you hear the word could have been could have been What About Us we could have been right oh well this is applying it to us it's worth the fight it's worth the battle Hallelujah like my old friend said I don't want no trouble at the river that's right they Journey 40 years and every one of them died but Joshua and Caleb the ones that stayed on the original were think about it listen what word Psalm says in Psalms 18 31 he said it is God that girth me with strength and make it my way perfect it is God who's doing this Hallelujah so what I look toward the hill what hill Calvary for which cometh my help and my help comes from who the Lord we can't do it but we know who get brings the help help me Lord Hallelujah you can't overcome this age with your intellect Hallelujah we need the Holy Ghost in power that that you know he said we're brothers I got the Holy Ghost and Power brother man said it like this he said there come a time in your life you need to you need to call a conference with God that means you got to get to yourself somewhere you got to get to yourself and you got to call a conference with him and you got to bring his word to him and said you said God I believe and you're the only one that can change me into what your word promised I would be right you gotta you gotta come with you gotta bring the word to God right when it was time for uh Israel to come out of Babylon somebody took the word and they brought that word back to God or God brought it down to him revealed 70 years is up it's time to get up out of here y'all understand me and when the prophet of God went off the scene that was our understanding it's time to get out of here why because Joshua is on the scene but you'll never cross over and listen the promised land wasn't uh how can I say it Canaan was it not was not heaven it was a time of battle and maybe we've crossed over to Canaan but that's not the ultimate amen because Joshua said give me my Mountain I want my inheritance I want the promises of Moses Hallelujah I'm still oh I'm old but I'm still young I can fight like I'm young anyway so we will not misunderstand it's worth the battle we sang that song is worth my crying it's worth my dying ah God I know it's worth it to make Heaven my home Hallelujah but you can't just do that like I said the other day we've got to learn the only way that we're going to defeat Satan is by the by the word l-o-v-e love love conquers all things and Satan is a thing yep and you can't have oh I just love no no no God has to give it I love God because he what first loved me Jesus help me Lord call a conference you bring his word you bring his promises Lord you promised how did Seymour and them get get the Holy Ghost to fall in on Azusa Street they saw the word there in Acts they saw the word that the Holy Ghost was promised and they got a conference they had a conference with God and they wouldn't stop it took months I don't know how long it took but they didn't stop until God fell until God came down and that's how it is I don't care how long you gotta stay on your knees don't stop you might have to get up go to work come back and get back on your knees until you know that you know that you know that you know and listen when you know everybody else will know too no weakness Paul was seeing all that stuff going on he says None of these things move me I love those words I love those words Paul says None of these things move me yes let it happen let it always raining outside it's thundering this lightning but you that's okay I must I've got a shelter Hallelujah I'm under his wings Hallelujah and you and I must understand that that's the way we must the attitude must change no matter what comes along I have a shelter I have a security right and because listen those birds during the storm don't they sing you ever heard bird singing during the rain I have oh yeah because they they they're happy and you know why because they know that rain gonna bring worms yeah that rain comes soften that ground and those worms come sticking up and those birds are quite happy you ought to see them in my yard I got a lot of robins boy they be having you talking about a Pentecostal Revival they really go out there and have a great time and I I enjoy I enjoy looking at them worms ain't got a chance it's a wonder it's amazing Hallelujah let's go to uh Psalms 19. it says 1913 he says to let the word this is so important Lord have mercy let the word of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my strength and my redeemer let the words of my mouth see that's that's keeping yourself James says a man who can Bridle his tongue is a perfect bag let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Lord don't let me think on evil don't let me think on evil things or do evil things y'all hear what I'm saying I'm God this message is speaking to me be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength in my redeemer Psalms 18 it says I love thee O Lord my strength is that okay amen I I'm gonna keep on going up you don't have to turn amen Psalms 18 says the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my Buckler and the thought the the Horn of my salvation Hallelujah in my high tower it is such a man it's so amazing to me that these men of God like Moses and Joshua and different ones I mean you even take Hannah how she prophesied about things in the future she got so caught up in the spirit amen and you think about how these people when they get caught up all they do is praise God and worship him and give him honor where honor is due hey have I asked in church I'm uh anybody got a praise come on hey it shows something wrong I remember even in the Pentecostal Church would they answer that you you almost hear the chairs turning over people jumping out of their seat so fast yeah we did we had popcorn praises amen right did I get all those quotes that I wanted to there was another one too there brother um another quote three all together the first one is uh from God I just read that when uh God never changed his mind speak to the Rock um that that that's actually the uh and the one in a million maybe I didn't have it on there one in a million let that be the last one anyway okay you love the Lord one in a million that would be uh paragraph 54-57 I don't think I wrote that down I'm not sure now Joshua is this okay I'm almost Joshua had no way to knowing he could take that City Caleb had no way of knowing it but here's how they believed it because God says I have given you this land I've got an angel that'll go before you but take heed that you don't despise him because my name is in him now you've got to under understand let's bring it to our day I've got a messenger William Branham don't despise him because my name is in him right he won't pardon your sins he will tear you across a fireplace he will rougher up your feathers he will do things for you but remember follow him in other words he's not going to make excuses for your sins you must overcome them you gotta conquer it right but you continue to follow him he will lead you to the promised land but don't despise him don't reject him believe him now then we noticed in the journey Joshua had found out that he had seen the great God living there in that pill of fire had performed all kinds of Miracles he and Caleb had seen that and they had confidence that God would keep his word watch God way down in Egypt I have given you the land now go and possess it you can't you can't you can't you can't face god with Lord I can't do it we had a prophet with Joshua on the inside who did it yes amen right and you and I must understand by the grace of God now that the prophet of God is going who are we who voice are we listening to the same voice God given every sick person in here Divine Healing huh God's given he said he didn't say God is going to give God's given every sick person in here Divine Healing every one of you Jesus was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed it's yours but you have to fight for every inch you possess everywhere the soul of your feet travel God told Joshua I've given I have given you Footprints and means possession let let's move in tonight amen let's go in Footprints is possession let's take every inch of ground that God has given us if Lord I'm getting excited listen let's take every ground that God has given us if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promise is unto you is to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call listen that's your inheritance that's your heritage Footprints is possession let's go get it it's ours Jesus Christ the same yesterday the damn forever he possess it the works that I do shall you also let's possess it is God promise don't look at the circumstances don't look how hard it is let's possess the land we're having a meeting like this morning where where we were having a meeting there and the Holy Ghost falling in the place the people screaming and shouting and praising the Lord and then someone come up and said pray for me brother Branham I said hands on him I laid hands on him and prayed for him and I said now go and believe now here's what it is it's easy to feel the power of God to see it uh when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have y'all hear it that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you gotta fight for every inch Hallelujah screaming and shouting not standing still you're going to be crying somewhere something emotional is going to come forth amen I know when the power and the Revelation hit your soul you don't feel a thing but when that whale start moving from that last Dimension from your soul and start moving up into your spirit Hallelujah where all your emotions are now Jesus is not a liar he told the woman I give you water that will spring up didn't say stand still didn't say Still Waters Run Deep even though they do but you know what that devil has been sneezing he's a character and he's duped these people I've heard people say things you know what and I know it's going to sound funny to somebody I better leave that alone you know because I hear people say oh I just love brother Branham and I'll be thinking all the time you've never met him and what you've met is not William Branham it's Jesus Christ it's Jesus Christ who you love but people oh I just love brother Branham you know why they said because brother William said all that love me all that I love and all that love me and they take that quote and they just spread it all around and they live any kind of way but I love brother Phantom let me put it this way Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments and if you love brother Branham keep his commandment because his Commandments with Jesus Commandments people something else that Devil's smart he just let him go on their way go on their way and he'll drive him right into idolatry and they won't even know it God had to show Moses that that serpent on the pole was now an idol among the people they didn't even know it but somehow they began to worship that thing and it was wrong in the eyes of God y'all y'all think I'm crazy I know you get you go I'm I'ma hit this and go ahead you're going to some message church today they don't have all these pictures and the first thing people said well there ain't no master Church they don't have the pillar fire that ain't the pilify that's a picture of it but they handle it it's such an idle way they don't understand what they're doing I'm not saying they're deliberately doing it but how how how can you define a message Church by the things hanging up on the walls well I'll show you how the holy how the Holy Spirit defines it saying spirit that dwelled in Christ dwell in you that's that's it Christ the hope of glory in you the other church not this room even though we come with revers and respect this is not it this is going to burn up but the real one amen cannot die I'm not saying people do that deliberately no they've been taught that and they just carry it on and nobody ever consider it is that all right amen you know it don't make no difference because I'm a preach it anyway the truth of the matter is we got to be set free from all of this if we're going to see Jesus as he is we need the naked word we got to do away with all of the stuff and allow God to build his character in US that's what we've got to do somebody told me the other we're not long ago when they left this church and went somewhere else and you mean to tell me that you're saying that the system that brother Branham set up is wrong I said I never said that we made it wrong hello we made it wrong because you know what we did we systemized it her brother random never ever stopped the moving of the Holy Ghost it's 30 minutes we done we done sang 30 40 minutes that's enough and the Holy Ghost is moving what nonsense is that he governed those people with a law because many of them didn't even have the Holy Ghost a lot of them jumping up speaking in tongues and everything and trying to interpret why the word was going so he had to put things in order but he never ever tried to stop the moving of the Holy Ghost and that's what we've done that's how carnal people is you you're saying that's a system no that's not what I was saying and if you thought that's what I was saying you were carnal in your thinking and your accusations are wrong who am I to correct the prophet you understand what I'm saying but what I'm trying to say is we don't systematic now I just think so much to people won't move they won't even say hallelujah glory to God and everybody's worried about how long you've been there I believe with all of my heart the Holy Ghost is a gentleman and when it's time for the word to begin he's going to make it so but let me ask you a question if I come up here and I preach 20 minutes and the Holy Ghost Falls what am I supposed to do you know what brother Venom says stop he said because that's what you've been preaching for you're preaching for him to come he can do in a split second what you couldn't do in 30 minutes or an hour yep we're preaching that the anointing of God would fall is that right when the Peter was preaching then what the Holy Ghost fail that's why we preach so that the Holy Ghost can fall but when the Holy Ghost fall I'm supposed that when that sister the Lord was really blessing her and I'm I'm adding it on because I wanted more to enter in that's what it's all about he was in the house and we treated him like a stranger people don't recognize the presence of God because we strip the message people from it that's something we don't do that's Pentecostal you better get it you better get something on that order God will do what you want that's what I love about God he took those staunch Jews and let the Holy Ghost fall on them they jumping all out the window screaming running up and down the street he's here you know he's alive staunch that happened in my church in Lima people who had never moved had a brother come from Africa preach about 15 20 minutes they were running on I mean the Holy Spirit came in this move I'm like oh my God I had never seen like that before and then from there we started our Revival yes I'm at the end here it's worth the battle let me tell y'all something people of God which you better recognize and I I say that with respect and honor you can be sitting here in your greatest of Health but you never know when your last breath is going to leave you we assume because we're young we've got more time that is the trick of the devil that's why the Bible said today the day did you hear my voice Harden not your heart but we'll walk out oh I got more time you don't know that and that's the thing you need to capitalize on Lord I don't know how much time I have but make me ready when Israel left Egypt there was approximately two million people left at the same time every one of them heard the message of a prophet every one of them saw the pillar fire every one of them was baptized to Moses in the Red Sea y'all y'all see all the all the ritualistic things that they had to do every one of them shouted in the spirit beat the tambourines and run up and down the banks with Miriam when Moses sang in the spirit they everyone drank from the same spiritual Rock they they very everyone each fresh Manna every night every one of them but there was two made the land one out of a million now let me say it like this because even Sunday when I was preaching I said if you think you know I don't know what it is but people instead of them taking God's word that it is God speaking sometimes they have this little thing about a pastor and you know what they do they think the past is hitting on them or really trying to rebuke them or say no that it's it's the attitude of the people your attitude toward the word and a lot of time people how can you use circumstances situations in this church that you can't help but to preach on nobody told you but God God speaks and a lot of times people that's why you know people don't understand the movement of God they don't know they don't know people say well well he he preached somebody told him I said what Paul said to the Corinthians I didn't heard about that adultery going on in that church somebody told me and you know what I believe it and he preached on it and not only that he said put him out he'd say put him out and he was going by hearsay but somebody told him that's the word what was the test they all drunk in the same Rock drink drinking the same Rock they all eat the same spiritual manner as we're eating this morning but the word test proved them when it come to time of cadence by Neil when they started over to the promised land and they could not go over till they was tested by the word do you hear me there will not be a rapture until that kind of opposition and that kind of test come upon us brother Ben call it the squeeze that's it and that's where you're going to have your final test that will be your final you know a way of saying I'm going to stay with God I will not that's the word amen unless you can tell me something else coming my way your final test ain't there ain't the cover shot you understand me that's just one of those little things that you know something bigger coming oh Lord have mercy let me move on I'm almost done the other ten the other 10 came back and said we can't make it the people are like we're like grasshoppers to them they're great wall City their opposition is too great you see what they're doing instead of being moved by faith instead of being moved by love they're being moved by fear but Joshua and Caleb's still the people they said we're more than able to do it why God said before they left the promise in I'm giving you the land I give it to you it's yours but there's where one of one of each million they there is approximately 500 million so-called Christians in the world today and each day ends a generation and now what if the Rapture would come today and 500 people University would be taken in the Rapture you you would never know or even see it in the paper of them going and the coming of the Lord is secret is a secret coming he'll come and steal away and it'll be such a minority see right just like in the days when disciples said Jesus why does the scribe say Elias must first come see see and Jesus said he has already come and you never knew it see that's what the world don't know thank you brother so the quotes that's what we get we can't you know the thing about it is such a secret and a lot of times you know it ain't the big events that we really need to watch out for because in reality that the Rapture is overdue it really is it's God waiting on us where we should have already done it and somehow I mean I thank God for his love and compassion because I'm glad he waited for me you know and my thing is this people of God you got to stop it and when I say stop it stop looking at everything stop looking at everybody in the church and what all they're doing let them do what they're going to do you can't stop it my point is this you can't change whatever seed they are it is what it is right and you preach the word and people don't repent don't get upset about it they don't repent must be something they reason why they can you just be thankful that God giving you Grace to repent that give you a heart to say Lord have mercy on me you know I'm grateful that when I see my sins I see them as sins my shortcomings I see that and don't get me wrong like I was telling my son today I said but don't get me wrong I said God knows I'm covered by the blood I see my faults but I'm covered by the blood I'm safe right because I'm in Christ he doesn't see my sin that's the message amen amen but you see I love him and I want to love him more to the point amen that that Satan can look at me and says what can I do next I've tried everything and everything has failed that's what I'm talking about living such a Victorious Life battle after Battle Victory after Victory but understand every Victory gives us a a a a a place for Testimony we ought to have testimonies all the time huh it God God delivered me today or God help me today or God gave me Insight today God did this if it that should be our conversation well you can't you can't you can't you know uh I'll put it this way in closing God said don't even talk about the things that they do in the dark is that the word the law don't even want us to talk about things that people have done in the dark don't talk about it you know what because it it does something to you so let's move on people let's move away from where we are let's move forward some of you may and you may not know but I'll be leaving on Friday I'll be gone for about a week and and I'm going I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going to meet my Lord and and and and I'm trusting and believing that this message that God is so how would you feel like this message is for you well first of all I thought another brother was supposed to preach so I didn't come really prepared and then I looked at my book bag and I left my tablet home if I had my tablet I would have been prepared thank you so I had to go into office and God started dropping it he gave me what to preach tonight and as he unfolded everything I knew he was talking to me I know he spoke to you tonight but he he gave me a word of confidence a surety that where I'm going and what I'm going to do he's going to meet me there I am so excited I'm really thrilled about because I know I just say like this I don't know how he what he's going what all he's going to do but I know I won't return the same man God is so good to us amen because God is going to do what he promised he would do and I believe this message with all my heart I really do and I believe that the bride is supposed to be a supernatural omnipotent bride and that's what I'm looking for in my life such a change that all can see Christ in me you love the Lord amen mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord he is trapping out the Vintage where the graves around restored he has loose the faithful lightning
