heaven and earth adore him what a mighty god we serve [Music] i will say this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] he made me glad i will rejoice for him [Applause] he has made me glad not prolonging the time we're just going to get right on into the word of god praise the lord we trust that everybody was blessed on this morning amen i could truly say that i was blessed amen in a great way ephesians please we're the third chapter of ephesians then we'll go to the first chapter then we'll read a few passages from there and then uh we'll just go ahead on with that but ephesians we know was a great book it is a great book and ephesians uh according to the prophet god parallels joshua it is the promised land it takes you into that promised land and one thing about the promises of god they cannot fail beginning at the seventh verse says whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god i want you to understand where this church is located it's located in heavenly places according to the eternal purpose which the purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and excess with confidence by faith of him wherefore i desire that you faint not at my tribulation for you which is your glory for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings here we go in heavenly places in christ not on earth in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of the children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the beloved amen well let's just stop right there i've got a few others but uh we're still working with the higher thinking and uh standing in heaven is what we're kind of working with higher thinking and then standing in heaven you know uh uh we know that god amen is doing a great thing and and i'm so glad to be part of that uh uh as you can look around you can see that uh the closer the day come the fewer the numbers uh but don't let that ever discourage you because that's the way it's supposed to be amen so let us pray father god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for everything lord we know that you you are here and we we're grateful for that we understand lord jesus where you desire to have us to be and it's our desire to be there father we just pray that you keep our hearts and our minds elevated in the in a place where we won't be forgetful like james say looking in the mirror and then walking away forgetting what kind of man we ought to be we just trust oh god and we place everything in your hands we pray that you would just use us this evening for your glory and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen so we we dealt with this morning uh a few things that you know excited me because i realized that man you know we talk about letting the mind of christ be in you it is something that most people can't comprehend especially the part where it says that uh he thought it not eat robbery to be equal with god and to be honest with you as a young christian that used to stumble me because first of all it uh god had to be defined you know a lot of times people think they know what god is or who god is and oftentimes they see god almost like a statue you know almost like some kind of thing you come to worship but it has no life in it you know um but god amen is very difficult to define him because his ways are past finding out i mean there is no way that you could ever put god in a box you know this is why god even in the early part of the scripture he never gave himself a name and then when he gave his name to moses he said i am that i am you see because god always will you know reflects himself in so many ways we know god even in the sense of a husband and a wife right because we know that when god created adam and eve in his image they were male and female but understand in those attributes there's still perhaps trillions of things that we have never seen uh or and and wouldn't understand it if he would show us but god tries to break himself down and put come down into a lower lower state to a place where we can comprehend and understand right and and understand that even in our intellect we think that we can understand him but that's not the way god is understood he's understood by revelation and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it so we understand by god's grace how do you get the mind of god what is the mind of god and when you see the mind of god you must understand you're working with god right it's not like god got a little section in his spirit where there's a mind god in himself is his mind you know he's his very thought he's he's everything you know and uh because we first of all must understand that god is a spirit and this is why oftentimes people misunderstand god they don't understand him they think you know he's more like a man you know some people picture him as an old grandpa you know sitting on a big throne and he's ruling everything and then you got jesus and mary and whoever else but they have the wrong picture you know brother branham tried to describe him to us you know a fountain of love a fountain of peace a fountain and then when you when you think about a fountain you think about where did the fountain come from but he is called what we call the self-existing one and the bible tells us he's all and in all there's no way to hide from him regardless to who you think you are whether you be sinner or saint we all will meet him one day now god is such a powerful god he he knows he could be he is so great he can humble himself and he hides himself in such a simple way that you know the the smart man seemed to miss him uh but one thing we know that god has already declared himself even in his nature you know we see birds and we see and you think to yourself this thing god you know it's and god is just we call him god because before he was god he was self-existing one and god means to worship but then there's a lot of people don't even know what they're worshiping and but we we we know we know that god is a spirit and this is why we need the holy ghost because the holy ghost will lead us and guide us into all truth right and the holy ghost will tell us everything of the father everything that the father wants us to know of him the holy ghost will reveal it to us isn't that amazing that god can reveal these things to us and then the thing that he revealed to us we can't tell somebody else because they wouldn't understand what you're talking about but it's a personal thing it's something that god amen has has done now the thing that i'm looking for and the thing that i'm so excited about tonight is that the very fact that god purposed me and you to have his mind to have his whole being because brother branham didn't know how to say it no better than this he said all that was in god he poured it into christ and all that was in christ he poured it into his church now paul had a different way of saying things but paul basically tried to tell us that we were the very offspring of god right i mean we understand that according to access he's he's not like these animals and things that people try to fix put in their minds this fee these fictitious things but he is we are the very offspring of god and so if we can understand who we are and what we are composed of now we know by god's grace and i'ma get to the message in just a moment but we know by god's grace that we're made in the image and likeness of god now a lot of time people on this don't understand what the image and likeness of god is but but uh you know we know that when it comes to the image and likeness of god he's not just talking about your outer shell right he's talking about the inward composition right that soul in that spirit because nobody's ever seen their soul and nobody's ever seen their spirit but but yet and still we are in a house we we hide and nobody has ever seen us really right but but we're there we have this housing that that supports us until our time is up on this earth but jesus said to his disciples when you see me you see the father so he was very descriptive because they had seen god they have seen jesus do a lot of things but he wasn't saying okay that that when you see me god has these brown eyes and brown hair and this no he was working with the quality of character that they had witnessed in the time they were fellowshipping with him uh the supernatural because remember jesus says i can't do nothing except the father show me now we're standing in heavenly places we are in a place amen that we god is calling us to move into what we know as the supernatural and i explain that amen it's it's it's another dimension that we are we have been you see because when you're born you're born into this dimension this dimension has gravitational pulls it holds you here but in that dimension there are no gravitational pulls you can travel from here to there without power boosters right you don't need a rocket ship you just move by the power of the anointing from one place to another you say well how can that be scriptural the bible said it was philip that god translated him from one place to another he didn't need no earthly equipment it was god who translated him but what about enoch enoch still lives he never died as far as we know of but the bible said he was translated and he was found not now i don't know about you but i know i came from god you must know you came from god and if you came from god you go back to god there is no other way you're either of god or you're of the devil amen we must think if we are the offspring of god and according to the book of acts it says even your poets say it that we are the offspring of god now as far as i understand whoever this poet was amen wasn't even a christian but he had the revelation that we were the descendants or the offspring of god now when you say that you must understand what you're saying because some people would think you blaspheming you know because remember lucifer wanted to be as god he wanted a been a higher level of uh order than what god had put him in now i want to say like this when god created adam and eve that both name were adam they were on an equal basis but the woman has always been subject to the man a lot of times people think the woman was subject only after the fall but remember amen adam represented god he was the male part of god and eve or adam's second was he was the female part of god which represents the bride god will always be god we're attribute of him you understand me he was the original and we if you want to put it in it's uh how do you say the byproduct of who he is what he is amen we we want as you can say we were part of elohim but we're not elohim if that makes sense right we are part of him but without him we're nothing and i don't know how to explain that no better than that so that you can understand the functions of what god is trying to do the front of the first thing that god wanted to do was make a family he was father right he tutored he worked with uh adam and everything else and the the next uh episode of adam and eve was to produce children of their kind which would have made god have would have placed god in a place where he had a family well that was interrupted that was interrupted now paul is trying to tell us that the whole family of god is named after him so now god has a family but you must understand that the family that god has was produced by the second adam amen hallelujah who is jesus christ himself which is he said a quickening spirit and this is why we need the holy ghost the holy ghost is that quickening spirit amen that brings us into the family of god listen paul says listen he says listen i i i want you to understand that what i have has been given to me by the grace of god in other words i didn't earn it but god has made me a spokesman for him and i'm here to tell you gentiles you don't understand maybe in in the future you understand the riches amen the god has given and the grace that god has given to us now think about it amen god chose the jews but he married a man a gentile hallelujah and the gentiles were considered dogs amen but god took the least of all kinds of people and raised them up and put them in heavenly places in christ jesus this is not something that we're just going on in our head it must settle in your heart right but the more revelation you have the greater the revelation you have the humbler you become right true revelation do not exalt you hallelujah it humbles you because you realize amen without the grace of god i would have nothing listen paul said it this message i'm trying to bring to you and brother said he preached exactly what paul preached right he said is to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which whom from the beginning of the world have been heared in god who created all things by jesus christ now the fall came right and we have all through ages looked at god as though he's this mean guy who's forcing everybody to worship him and if you don't worship him he's going to destroy you by sending your soul to hell and you know many people think that because my my relative amen said to me why should i worship a god who's trying to force me to worship him and you know people say that out of ignorance because they don't know who god is they don't know what god is satan himself has has blinded the people i mean literally it is his working that is evil but they he makes the people think that it's the working of god well if he was god why does he let this happen well no no no he doesn't let it happen you choose for it to happen he has given you the right to say yay or nay right and and so had it not been for sin none of this would be happening right and adam and eve chose the way they went well if he knew it was going to happen well that's a long story but the whole point is god's word a promise cannot come back void right now we look at this thing and we say okay brother brooks what are you saying what he said according he had an eternal purpose now you know what that word means eternal that means it had no beginning no ending this has always been with god his purpose has always been with god and what it is to for a man to live without a purpose every man has a purpose hallelujah and god had a purpose and his purpose was to create and and become a god and be worshipped and have a family and you know we can't even we can't even imagine the unfolding of god in the years to come now we call it years but we don't know what eternality in eternal life brings but we have no idea and yet i i like myself even in this stage almost like in the seed form you know of of eternity what's really going to come through all of this you know but we know that the adversary and i'm gonna go here now a little bit we know that the adversary that we're working with is just temporal he's not eternal but god is using this adversary to produce you the god that he wants to see come out of you or to be reflected from you he uses the darkness to glorify the light now the bible said whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named and i'm thinking now because we talk about names i told you that god told moses i am that i am and and and that just gets to me because i think now he moves yet his character stays the same but there are so many things about him to really this time is what we we would say gave him a name and when i say that i mean as he changed from his glory to glory to manifest himself to us to make us understand who he is then names were given and we know by god's grace that uh when the angel came and um gave jesus his name of course that was important that was really the first of of god's name of salvation which means jehovah is salvation and still yet nobody knows what jehovah means you understand what i'm saying but we know by god's grace that this name was given because here god wanted you you and i to know him not just by character but by name because because when we say jesus christ we have no idea what we're saying amen we know it's his name but what's all in that name he's placed it there he's he's jehovah jiren jehovah shalom jehovah tiscanu jehovah i mean you know he's basically saying in my name i'll be to you whatever you want me to be or whatever you need me to be now i'm saying these things for a purpose because if you can understand him then you'll understand what that is in you we call the mind of jesus christ see it unfolds into to a place where you have to hold your head because you can't you can't grasp the the the the how can i say it the omnip the omnipotence of it how great it is the powerful name of jesus christ is now you it's in you it's your mind and that's why the scripture says is there anything too hard for god absolutely he's god what and i'm saying he's in you amen that's why the word of god says greater is he that is in you that is than he that is in the world then when you can see that all things become possible we talk about staying in that heavenly places not on earth though we be on earth we stand in heaven right right so we understand by god's grace paul says i i cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayer that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom what is wisdom solomon said i've tried everything he said i can't come to the conclusion fear god amen and keep his commandment now this fear god doesn't mean like oh i'm scared of him but it's to reverence him to reverence god and keep his commandments and i'm coming to that in just a moment because i want you to understand by god's grace this what we we so need is the answer to every problem amen what is that brother brooks divine love because that's who god is it conquers everything it answers everything it it is god and divine love is not something you can give yourself it's nothing that you can practice it is a gift of god it's when god chooses you right like brother said it's not you choosing god it's god choosing you he chose you you didn't choose him oh i found jesus you didn't find him he found you he never was lost and so when we can find and understand that this thing has always been about love and grace it does something to you it puts you on a higher level of understanding when you read the scriptures you understand really what he's doing you know we see when he says go in there and kill everything you know they used to get mean what you mean kill babies children and but we understand now by the word of god that what he was talking about killing was not of his you ask a person well most normal people are afraid of snakes and you ask a person if you saw a snake would you kill him yes let's go on so i just want you to understand by god's grace god knows those that are snakes right now the bible says and what is the exceeding he wants our eyes of understanding to be enlightened that means revelate it can i say this you cannot die amen you know and most people are afraid of sicknesses because they're afraid to die but if you can get rid of the fear of death you can conquer the sickness hallelujah and you gotta understand enlightened that means i'm not just a man but i'm a god man made in the image and likeness of god and everything that he is i am in this world that's what it says as he is so are we in this world what do you mean as he is we can't even comprehend as he is he's unlimited basically let's say like that god is unlimited in his power in his strength and listen people there there is no competition satan can't compete with god there is no competition and this is why god had to put us here in such a way that through this battle satan could have something to battle could you imagine an angel called lucifer trying to defeat god who created him and god had to condescend down to an earthly way of living in order to battle what we call lucifer who's supposed to be the great one and then and then even in that he conquered the devil conquer death hell and the grave i'm saying all these things because we're getting ready to embrace the greatest darkness that has ever hit the earth and you must know who you are you got to know it it can't be something oh i think i'm saying no you got to go beyond i think i'm saved you got to understand the person that's in you and you've got to understand that now that i'm in the spirit of god i am as god is not that i did it i didn't do it he did it amen he made me who i am and i want to honor him with what he's made me and this is where god is looking for his bride eve dishonored her husband hallelujah but this one will not dishonor her husband she will honor him in every word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah look what the bible says and say he says listen and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us what who believe according to the working of his mighty power you can't even believe without his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places now i know everybody think that jesus christ is sitting right here you know on the right hand but we must understand jesus christ is the temple of god amen amen right and the father who we call the spirit is the spirit so we must work with the dimensions we work with dimensions where god amen dimension where he dwells hallelujah and that setting on the right hand means that he is the authority and power of god what we call the logos what we call amen the people of fire is the authority and power of god that's who he is because he is god hallelujah far above all principalities and power might and dominion every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come now what let me read this again which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above principalities y'all understand me and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come it don't stop it doesn't stop you know it's not like god creates something here and it's over no what he's creating here now goes beyond this dimension into the next it doesn't stop god doesn't produce perfection and then set it on the shelf there's more work to be done but the beauty of it is that we'll it'll be absence of satan in his people there be no evil there there'll be no darkness there there be nothing to hinder can you imagine amen hallelujah and people would say you know i heard this young man say somebody was witness to him says wouldn't you like eternal life he's oh no he said to live eternally would be boring well he doesn't have to worry about it to live in hell will never be boring it'll be such a way that he wish he had had answered correctly to that question yes i want eternal life what it is about jesus that nobody wants him and it so amazes me here it is the god who created you and you don't want to meet him you say he's dead and yet he's alive in your own intellect you just don't want to receive remember the bible said they did not want to contain god in their knowledge and because they didn't want to hold him there he gave them a strong delusion that they would be a leave a lie and be condemned by it so they're god don't put them in hell you did that you you chose to go to hell by refusing to acknowledge that he is god but look at this but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us i'm coming to the love i'm coming you see let me tell you something prophecy in itself is the love of god amen prophecy of himself when god prophesies something and tells you what is going to happen in the future that is his love and his way of warning us to stay away from his judgments right he even tells us you know if you stay in that system out there you're going to receive of her plagues come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her plagues and what are we dealing with now plagues hallelujah let's move on even when we were dead and sins have quickened us together with christ listen this is what i want everybody to hear and see because now i understand by grace are you saved [Laughter] you know that's a powerful revelation because it can't be law and grace at the same time by grace are you saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus the atmosphere the anointing the person we're setting in him he's in us and we are in him that in the ages to come he might show the exceedingly riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus he's not angry he's not upset at his seed and at his children he's not just ready to throw you in hell every time you make a mistake that's what the blood of jesus is all about that's what grace is all about when they whipped him all night long i said like that i don't know how long they whipped him but when they whipped him and beat him to a pump almost it was for you it was for me he received your stripes and by his stripes we are healed you understand me that's what it's all about this message like i said denomination and organizations perverted it they they wanted to keep the people in control so they took the word of god and used the word of god as to bring laws do's and don'ts and paul says no no no touch not taste not handling that we're beyond that see what i'm saying because even the jews couldn't keep the law right and so we we look at this and now you say well what do you mean we got to understand that the holy ghost is given to you so you can love him god is not a slave master he's not one that's trying to make you serve him or make you love him it mean it must be something you are willing to do because if you willingly love him you will keep his commandments amen hallelujah is that the truth that's exactly right it's never been what we thought it was because i told you earlier this morning there's a difference between conforming and transforming you know to conform your way of life is to just really pattern it imitate it but transform means that the life is there to change you and this is what god wants he wants a changed life he wants his life in you that's what i'm saying nobody will be without excuse because he's willing to give you the holy ghost more than you desire to have it he's willing to give you the holy ghost but what keeps the people from getting the holy ghost is their approach you can't come to god offering in anything or promising him anything because whatever you give him is something he gave you the thing that god wants is your heart and he wants you to surrender that amen amen and once you surrender your heart god comes in it ain't hard it's not complicated it's surrendering to god says lord just as i am like i said this morning i don't have nothing to give you my life has been a wreck but if you can you can accept my heart if you can accept this wreck and you can change this wreck this is what i want to do change me oh god and god that's all he wants to hear that's what he wants to hear he wants to hear that kind of a prayer and when you give god i promise you there's no way you can pray that to god and god stand back and says i need a little bit more from you no it never has been works it has always been grace and to come that far in god is because god has been pulling on you amen is that right he have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus what are you saying when i give my heart to god immediately i am in christ immediately i'm setting in christ in heavenly places for by grace you are saying through faith that none of yourself it is what the gift of god not a works lest any man should boast and this is why some people take it to the calvinistic way i guess i'm saved by grace so i can just do what i want to no there's a balance to it right and the balance is because i am saved i want to do all i can do to love him and to live right and do whatever he wants to do whatever his word requires this is what i want and understand this this is the part i like when jesus steps in to you in his fullness he literally lives through you there is no my i can take this jacket off and lay it right there and it will stay there but when i take this jacket and i put it on i become the life of the jacket and wherever i go the jacket goes with me whatever i do as long as i got the jacket on it goes with me you understand this is how the holy ghost wants to operate in us he wants us to become justice jacket amen so he can walk through us talk to us and live through us don't you want that amen if if it makes me a fanatic so be it but let god the fullness of god live through us this is what he's working with now i'm coming to something i said uh we talk about love because see the bible said we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works so understand he's working on us i wish you know many times i wish it was zip it would all happen at one time but you'll miss the most important parts of god if it happened that way you can't appreciate summer until you go through winter you know all those sim all those seasons must come in order for you to appreciate the whole year right so that's how it is with god he has the seasons in our lives so he can reflect himself in some way right we might look at all them and we said my goodness you know the all the leaves are falling and the leaves but autumn they tell me it's the most beautiful season of them all it is the more remote the most realistic of all seasons because they say in the summertime you got all this green in there but that though the green is not the real color of the trees it's only when they're dying and remember brother branham says which is more beautiful the green tree or when it's dying and the colors and the shades it turns it becomes the glory of that tree and so that's how it is with the christian right it's when the christian is dying is when you see the beauty and the glory of what he really or she really is and god through these seasons shows us all these things the thing that i love about this is that we were in the tree of life from the foundation of the world where we're in him like we were in adam we were also in the tree of life remember there must be a male and a female american the power of love brother banham said it like this in the bombing gilead he says notice what he told me i've always believed and always believed that the power of love exceeds speaking in tongues it exceeds shouting it exceeds everything that i know of it has always been my theme always because this agape love he's speaking of is the holy ghost hallelujah so what are you saying now i'm coming down to to this portion of clothes but you know large will and wednesday we'll pick it up we're coming to the breaking of the day y'all know what i mean by that i'm not at the end of it i'm just saying i'm switching over so you can understand that love conquers all this battle that we're getting ready to embrace will only be conquered by way of love right so if you can't love your brother how are you going to love your enemy and we're not talking about filial love fill your love will fail you it's jealous it it just you can't it's unpredictable but god paid love is the only thing that can't be defeated tongues will cease prophecy will cease all will cease but the word of the lord shall stand and that word of the lord is love divine love he said watch now scripture isaiah was when he said watchman what of the night he said the watchman the morning cometh and the night also what morning comes but the night comes before the morning what was it anyone knows that just before the break of day just at the hours of the approaching of the day it turns darker than it ever was what we're seeing now is the gathering of the darkness and it's going to get darker but understand just as it gets is darkest that's when the light breaks he said oh my friend listen to thus said the lord listen he said listen to thus saith the lord so it can't fail if you consider me to be his servant it's just before the break of day that's why this horrible gloom is over the earth it's just before the coming of the lord jesus there's no more hope left it's nothing but but it's coming nations are against nations they have food uh food through god's laboratory till they got the power to blow one another into atomic ashes and they are wicked hello he said and they are wicked and they are unreligious and they are unchrist-like and the only motive they have an objective is to destroy they've been ordained to destroy and they are inspired by this destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men so how are you going gonna stop it can't be stopped that's why they're doing what they're doing you say it seem like they're crazy why are they doing this because they've been ordained to destroy let me say in the name of the lord jesus the holy spirit is sent as a watchman on the tower and as the people cry what of the night are you weary in this life are you weary of sin are you weary of funeral processions and sickness and ungodliness on every hand has the night been so been long and weary what of the night watchman he said the morning's coming see the comfort he says and the night is also coming what is the night look how in perfect harmony with the scripture as there was in the regular course of nature always that the approaching of the sun congeals the darkness together and makes it dark you understand me it is the approaching of the sun we're not talking about the s you in right now we're talking about the s-o-n it is approaching of the sun and because these dark spirits know that something is happening they're bringing themselves together and what they come to do crucify the lord and his christ everybody that truly believed in god this is what satan is this is a warfare folks watch that thing gonna turn people don't don't know that but christians will be persecuted in this country in the regular course of nature always the approaching of the sun congealed the darkness together and makes it dark it's darker before day than any other time in the night why it's the approaching light that making it's dark and it's the approaching of the lord jesus now that's bringing this gloom upon the earth amen and who can say there ain't gloom it's gloom everywhere amen it is approaching of this gloom right uh it's approaching of the lord jesus now that's bringing this gloom upon the earth did not he say when these things began to come to pass lift up your head for your redemption draw with night that's what i'm talking about love is love stretched his hand through time to this 2020 to tell me that when you see the gloom when you see the world in this condition i'm here i'm on my way light the light is about to break hallelujah the rapture is at hand this is not no hope so this is a no soul this is a dust said the lord it cannot fail amen think about it when john the baptist came god said he laid the axe to the root of the tree why because it was a time that the tree was supposed to bring forth fruit and all i could think about is this time is the bride really bringing forth fruit you understand me those who are called bride where is the fruit of of of of right and so you got to understand i heard him say you know this is wintering time now the prophet said this is wintering time the harvest basically over you know everything is being selected and now it's being separated and the winds of of destruction the winds of of differences are now blowing this chaff away and all he's going to have left is seed this is what god is now doing he's literally getting the seed people don't even know they can sit in church and be dead here is in my father glorified see this is so important it's one of those things that we overlook all the time he says here is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father have loved me so have i loved you continue in my love if i keep if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love you know what about me it means to live there that's your residence amen these things i've spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full right his joy might remain in us and that joy might be full i want it to be full yes i heard somebody say let it run over let the cup run over amen this is my commandment that you love one another as i've loved you we miss it we read it and we take an intellectual concept of it and then we take this little perverted love we think is love and we try to give it to each other and it doesn't work it's beyond that the love he's talking about can only be found in the holy ghost it's beyond that this love amen is is not puffed up it it it's not looking for rewards it's not looking to be recognized other than it is love greater love have no man than this than a le a man would lay down his life for his friend and ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servant for the servant knoweth not what his law doeth but i have called you friend for all things that i've heard of my father i have made known unto you now we are the only generation that i know of that have received everything from the father and when those seals were open that means if we can hear that he's no longer calling us servants but we are friends god is our friend right listen what he goes on to say hallelujah he says i have made you unto you ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shall remain that whatsoever ye ask of the father in my name he may give it you these things i've commanded you that ye love one another you understand me he he literally places so much emphasis on us loving one another as he's loved us now it seemed to be in the natural if you think with the carnal mind how can that be god has forgiven me i don't know how many times i've seen how many times i've made a mistake there there is it's innumerable and he's never had an attitude he you understand me he's never but in the natural we might have one at times but that ain't the kind of love he talking about he talked about love that supersedes that he's talking about the kind of love that you are dead to you're dead to yourself you understand i'm i'm i'm thinking higher now i'm thinking higher what i'm saying is what god has given us god has given us grace to live on the level that we've lived on now it's time to go higher it's higher in our thinking loving more there's no limit to our love no restraint to it you understand me see it that's what that song oh the love of god how rich how pure you know people don't come to church because they don't love god like they think they do they don't you got people right now who should be here out there fellowshipping around chicken or fish that's true but they love god no way no way your love is not sufficient we're working with agape love brother brahma said a true believer if they really got the holy ghost they can't hardly wait till those doors are open you know what and he said not only that they love each other so much too it almost bring them tear to tears to separate from one another i haven't seen that in years i've seen it where people just crying because the meeting is over and they don't want to go back to their separate homes but you got to understand what what this preparation for this is a preparation for the city to come amen i'm in the city are you in the city i'm a stone in the city and i'm in the city oh somebody help me here amen and i showed you that this love is so great that he just didn't engage himself to us but he says listen i'm going away to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also right he said and in my father's house there are many mentions you'll never have to worry about being lonely hallelujah you'll never have to worry about having fellowship hallelujah because there's a many mentions there and if it wasn't so i would not have told you now understand god does not make promises and not keep them amen i told you about how this morning we look at things in ways that we shouldn't look at them uh but uh you gotta understand that when you're thinking higher and you you do anything to achieve what god wants you to achieve and um you you think about uh tamar you know she she wasn't she may have been one rejected her husband died her brother-in-law's who should have married her rejected her i mean and then her father-in-law rejected her too but she knew there was something on the inside of her that made her know that she was supposed to be a part of this regardless who she was she wasn't even a jew but she knew and she went after the thing that meant the most to her i must get that seed she understood the law better than judah and guess what people like you've heard me say before she disguised herself like a prostitute she covered her face and he just assumed she was a prostitute and she went on to do what she did and guess what how many times men and women come together and don't conceive but this time god was in it and she conceived and she was willing to take the approach you know what it was like in israel if you was caught as an unfaithful woman or a holland and then they would stone you and she says okay let the man who wants to stone me identify these items she if she had only gotten the lamb when she had already the grace of god with her the lamb would have been eaten up whatever but no give me your sickness give me your staff in other words give me your the things that represent your character give it to me and when judah saw that he was just overwhelmed you are a more righteous woman than i am a righteous man you understand what i'm saying what am i trying to say the bride in this hour will do whatever it takes to get impregnated with the promise she do whatever it takes for that seed to be made manifested in her she doesn't care about what other people thinks she understand that if she had to go to the judgment it will not stand you see what i'm saying because she understand that the seed she got was from the man himself all right so you say well what do you mean so god gives you a view of this listen for a man to be lost it is something that he like brother said he he he chases after god warns us all the time right he yeah but we have to keep rejecting him keep rejecting there'll be nobody i don't care who they are would be able to say god you didn't give me a fair chance god is not like that especially in america yeah so you got to understand there'll be no excuses in that day so i'm coming on to to where i want to go second kings and i'm a close on that second kings 2 11 15. i'm jumping but i'll close on this i think i i came here the last service but i want to leave back on this leave uh out on this excuse me this message is so great and the more i see the love of god and how he's reached out to me i can't even i can't even i don't know how there are no words to worship him right now hallelujah seemed like it's just not good enough but because realistically i know i deserve hell realistically i look back my on my christian walk and i'm ashamed so many things left out so many things could have been done but you know there was too much me my works and my desires and all of that you know you can do things and you can be anointed and it's still not the will of god david took that arc and he put it on on a cart with all that anointing with all that of pentecostal parading he went on and he was out of the will of god that's the scary part that's why the bible says acknowledge the lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path we you know we must begin to live like we have no head other than jesus christ how can you love god and not love his word but in his second king second chapter and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind now you heard me say this the other night the other day i think you did i believe i spoke this out to you and we liking this as the rapture he was caught up but watch how the scripture is being read there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven it didn't say that elijah went up to in into heaven on a chariot nor was he riding a horse it doesn't say he got on the chariot he doesn't he didn't say that but whatev but one thing it did say is that the horses at the chariot open up something parted it produced a portal and a whirlwind elijah up i'ma say it again because regardless of what it looked like it was the pill of fire the pill of fire did what it parted the red sea it parted the jordan it parted the heavens and a whirlwind took him up now i'm saying this because he told elisha if you see me go away i'm gonna give you a double portion now you know why i'm saying it like this because oftentimes we see something that is so spiritual looking we accept it without examining it to make sure it is the word right i mean how many of us saw the picture of jesus when we were little and it wasn't him but if somebody would have asked us who is that we'll say oh that's jesus it wasn't him it was somebody forming or taking a picture and acting like he was and we don't even know whether the man who took the picture acting like jesus was a christian or not but you understand what i'm saying instead of examining examinating things we take it as people picture it and we run with it so but now what we need to do is to take the scripture and says okay there was a portal there was a doorway there's a way god made for us to dem dimension to open up and go into wherever elijah went and understand the same elijah is still living right because you got to understand that when they were on the mount transfiguration something happened it was a dimensional thing it's like you watching a tv that television set is reflecting a different dimension even though you won't decide and so what they saw you gotta you gotta it said it was the appearance it doesn't mean that it was actually is but whatever it is we know that god parted something and opened it up and elijah went up into heaven so we got to understand that when god begins to do something let me tell you something brother told us something that the world laughs at he said those same lights those same ufos he said they are investigating angels and he says one day they will pick you up huh you tell that to somebody where do you find that in the scripture but what they don't understand is that the word of god is taking us higher it's beginning to make us see that there's life beyond this life and our life is in that life we're supposed to reflect what's on the other side here that's what jesus did he said the son of man he's standing right here but he's still in heaven come on dimensions they know it's real and he said elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemans thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into pieces now remember the first time that elijah gave elijah amen the garment elijah elisha gave him the garment back because in reality the garment was too big for him to fit now watch this he says so you can understand my father my father the charity of israel and the horsemen thereof he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into two pieces something was torn something was rent something was opened so that elijah could go up right now if if if uh none of us have seen horsemen horsemen fired horsemen or fired chariots and and in in heaven there could be wherever they came from they were there right they came here it doesn't say elijah god on it it may have but it doesn't say that that's what i'm trying to say what i'm trying to say is that's not so much as important as the parting the opening the separation and here elijah elisha rinses clothes what was it now he understood now it's time for i saw you go i saw this rapture because this is what the message brings to us is the rapture of elijah and it brings us amen to a place to show us that we will be raptured you know what you're saying you know you had elijah and you had moses moses represented old testament saints elijah represented the new testament saints and we're going to be raptured but how a portal a mystery okay let me let me get you something here just a minute just a minute brother branham says in christ is revealed in his own word you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here too just in another dimension faster than this right through this room is coming colors every color shirt dress whatever you go got on is eternal laying right on records going around and around the world every time you bat your eye is right on record watch television will prove that see we think we're going to go billions of years away but he says no it's just a dimension away where did he go when he was caught paul said i don't know where i was what heaven i was in he said i can't tell you whether i was in the body or out of the body then brother branham comes and says i was laying on my bed thinking what i'm going to do i haven't done nothing for the lord every time i hear him say that i'm like god you take a microscope to find whatever i've done for you but then he said justin he stopped feeling a little funny and the next thing he know he was looking down at his face at himself and all of a sudden he see millions of these people running to him he was just right right above like rooftop but in another dimension in another world you see but a portal of some sort was open to him let me tell you something even in the seventh seal when those seven angels came and picked him up he did not go there in the flesh i don't know how god did it but he said those angels picked him up there was no air to breathe he would have froze to death it was space the cloud was higher than moisture could even exist in but he was caught up he said he was and i believe it i don't understand all of these dimensional things but i do know that we're now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus hallelujah you love the lord i'm just going to stop here i'll continue i'm not done because i i just kind of if paul is trying to get us to see who we really are in ephesians he's telling us and we've been ordained and then he tells us you know not only have we been ordained but we've been ordained to adoption do you know what that means that means that it cannot fail it ain't based upon you is it based upon him he's done it for us he will do it it cannot it cannot be on how good you are no he gave us something that we perhaps forget sometime we became his sin he became our sin that we might become his righteousness that's why god works with us not according to our righteousness is according to his thank god for it i miss the mark all the time i'm forever asking god to forgive me i'm forever asking god for his mercy i'm forever asking god for his grace it is my will to be perfect in his sight but without him it's impossible i know that and it's the grace of god that that he has promised to give it to me and you he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it and i say yes lord let's stand we're standing in such a place right now that the world is moving on and they have they've got no idea what's coming but god always have a watchman he's got somebody there to warn us and make us see what's going on the world is shaking people are anxious china india america you name it everybody is talking about war everybody now is talking threats to one another and brother adam say they crazy yeah they're evil i mean you know they're evil you know evil man has no conscience of evil it is what he is so he he he can't feel bad about what doing wrong he just didn't know i feel sorry no he has no conscience of feeling sorrow sorry i mean you look at people you know you got these what they call it serial killers and everything you know they don't go and they cry about what they just did no they go look for the next victim victim see whatever what else they can do to to to to satisfy that wickedness in them and that's what we're working with now it's like lucifer and his children loose photo you ever seen him repent you ever say see him in the scripture anywhere where he says i'm sorry i did this no even when god takes him and throws him have him thrown you know in the lake of fire you you'll never hear him cry for mercy this is a natural thing for man to cry for mercy but he is so cold and evil there is nothing to cry out for you know i just want you to understand his children are the same father we so thank you for this time we thank you for being so good to us lord keep us and guide us strengthen us lord keep taking us higher lord higher higher higher than you lord crown us lord jesus with that agape love lord we know it's your grace and your mercy that give this to us and father you said we could ask whatsoever we will and it shall be given and father that's all i desired your agape love to feel me and seal me oh god till i am
