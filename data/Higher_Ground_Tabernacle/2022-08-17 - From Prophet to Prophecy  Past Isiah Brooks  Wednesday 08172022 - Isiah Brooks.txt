TRANSCRIPT
========================================
prophecy has now become uh once spoken by a prophet has now become evident and that's what the word of god tells us in this last day that uh modern events is being made clear by prophecy things that have already been prophesied of a prophet is not just a any man he's one hand-picked man by god and they don't often come into this dimension but it often when they do come you know that the church at large has backslidden and god sends his own voice through a man to draw their attention and to try to get them back to the truth for israel he did that for hundreds of years but for the gentiles this is the first prophet we have ever had in history and throughout the bible there is no evidence of a jewish gentile prophet but if you understand the bible that is one of the mysteries of the seventh seal that god in the last day promised the son of man and the son of man is jesus christ himself we don't claim that william branham was jesus christ but it was god hiding behind the flesh of that man which he has always done the bible tells us that moses was christ you see and jesus christ himself had not even been born in this dimension yet but god always sends his spirit he always brings us uh a confirmation that the the the invisible is more real than the visible and that this dimension is just the negative part of the reality of what is really and truly real there is something in man that makes us know that even though we may not have read any type of literature to say god exists but there's something in the soul of man that that makes us know he exists we can criticize people in india or africa or or south america because they might be worshiping idols but the reason why they do that is because they know there is a higher being they know that there is a god and they understand they were just not made by evolution they understand the least of things that the god who created the heavens and the earth is still alive and they do whatever they can do to find him and of course satan gets in the process of that and mislead them but one thing for certain god is always true think about it how israel looked for the messiah knew he was coming according to the scripture they missed his birth and they missed his death but most of all they missed his life when he was born israel knew nothing about it and god had to choose wise men and shepherds to declare that jesus christ god of earth and heaven had been born in a manger all the religious people never knew he was here this is the reason why they crucified him because according to their theology their doctrine divinity their interpretation of the scripture jesus did not come in the way they expected him to come matter of fact he came in a way that they would probably never thought he would come a lamb born in a manger but that was the way he did come and even when he did come you had herod who tried to kill him this world has never wanted god because this world does not belong if i could say to god even though god created it adam forfeited his rights and from that point on satan has reigned over the earth this is why things have become worse and now we understand this age as the the most evilest age ever this is the most deceptive age because in this age satan is ruling he is the god of this age for now but we understand by god's grace that even even in the darkest of all nights god always shines light because the bible said he's never left himself without a witness we take it for granted that we can see that brother branimo william branham is malachi 4. we take it for granted that he is luke 17 30. but there are millions of people who can't see what we see and by seeing who he is it's more than that you know he didn't come for us to sympathize with him and say oh by knowledge i know that that he is the prophet of this day but he didn't come to identify himself he came to identify jesus see that's what that's the way john the baptist was he did not come to be identified as some great prophet because they asked him who are you are you jeremiah or you know one of the great prophets he says you know are you the christ no no no no i'm neither of those and then he read a scripture a quote in a scripture that was in malachi and they did not even recognize it says no i'm just one the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the lord it was in their scripture but they could not see it had not been quickened to them and therefore when they missed the prophet they missed the messiah because it was the prophet who pondered to the messiah and said this is him amen i'm not worthy to lose the latches of his shoes that's what our world has done everybody's talking about the rapture everybody's talking about the translation and they've gotten the wrong revelation of his coming amen because theologians have interpreted the word in their own way they've made movies about it and everybody believe that's the way it's going to be when jesus had plainly said in his word he'll be like a thief in the night they won't even know that the rapture is taking place until it's gone we had a prophet and one of the world want to call us crazy because we believed in it well you won't be the first those who followed noah was crazy those who followed moses was crazy and even those who followed jesus was crazy see so the world can't see who you are so much so jesus said if they whatever they did if can't you see what they did in the green tree if they persecuted me if they mistreated me what are they going to do with you amen those of you who come in the dry so we know that understanding this message and declaring what it is and who it is is not a thing this message is not william branham this message is jesus christ in word form and if you can believe the word of it you can receive the spirit of it which is nothing but the true holy spirit the prophet of god talks about it in a shame and how people will be ashamed of christ they've always been ashamed of the true religion of god or the true salvation of god pentecostals used to be it used to be a shame to be one of them but see they have compromised now they're one of them not of god they've become so worldly they wanted to be accepted but those who are truly of god you are never accepted amen not even by your loved ones because you're peculiar you're strange you're different and that's good because we're not from this world we come from god and we go back to god hallelujah in the message he said just a perfect message back to the word he was talking about how eliezer went to get his bride he said ella uh i'm sorry yeah eliza went to get isaac abroad his go get that bride now he's describing his ministry he said that's my duty that's what god told me go get my bride that's what i'm here for that's what he says that's what i'm trying to do is call out a bride amen they missed it they they saw the signs of the messiah they saw how he preached to the poor they saw how the message he preached heal the brokenhearted they saw how he brought deliverance through to those that were captive yeah right he they saw how he recovered the site many people who who who i wonder where they are whose site was restored that wasn't a man that wasn't the power of william branham that was the son of man that was god amen fulfilling that portion of his ministry through a man right hallelujah and he said at liberty them that are bruised you see many of us are bruised and we have been bruised by religion by politics by family members bruised but not broken amen and god was able to mend us because it was a time of acceptability that god was accepting us it's not that we accepted him he accepted us right the woman at the well he accepted her the woman at simon's house he accepted her right he didn't reject her everybody the religious system is the ones they're the ones who rejected these people matthew the tax collector amen was uh was uh contrary to the jewish belief uh here was a jew amen doing business for wrong stealing for rome cheating for rome and yet jesus christ come said come and follow me hallelujah look what brother branham says he says i'm only building the hour is close at hand when you're going to see something happen this is 1965 when something is going to take place and all this background here has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shake the whole nations you hear what i'm saying now you gotta understand people say well it won't be an open show but brother adam says in 1965 he said it's going to shake the nations everybody here in the nations will know that jesus christ is alive and well so many people misunderstand that i i listening to it i i didn't intend to listen to it but so many people misunderstand the quotes where he says i ride this trail again and many people backslid because you know what he died but he said this was a thus said the lord and people couldn't understand it it wasn't a man saying i ride this trail again it was a holy spirit amen listen i i can't even speak what yeah i don't know what i told you i had a dream some time ago and i didn't understand it until just now but anyhow the thing is it has to stay in continuity with the scripture after elijah rode the trail elijah rode the trail in the in the quoting of the dreams elijah went to heaven but then there was another brother who was a a saint of god he received a white horse too you don't hear people talking about that one though and he was able to take that same bread and horse breed of horse and he did what he did and he went up to heaven and he stopped the horse and he came back down why it wasn't time for him but the same word that captured and took william branham to heaven it's the same word that will take us and what people don't understand is that that vision is true but everybody must understand the interpretation is spiritual it's like david while he was preaching they pierced my hand and my feet they never pierced david hands they never pierced his feet but they did jesus why because that was not david speaking that was jesus christ speaking christ the anointing speaking through him i know nobody can make me doubt i think i told y'all i had a dream about when brother branham visited me and i don't say that to say it lightly this could wipe my salvation out by and i'm not going to tell you the dream but now i understand the dream and i'm going to tell you something like this the best is yet to come amen but we must stay with this word we can't depart from it we can't add to it we can't take it or take away from it we must take it just like it is and the holy ghost will reveal to you what it means and what it says and what it stands for go listen to and know if it's not 65 815 see what is happening there's a move of god that's moving because the bride has been quickened she's alive but she's not in a position where she should be because she needs revival all of the trash needs to be taken out of her life she found herself is that right brother said in the preview of the church he said the bride at the end was getting out of step and he was crying out stay in line stay in line and what was it we got out of step but thank god we get back in line amen look what he said see she's been quickened and that's what people don't understand we've got so many cults you got baptist cult presbyterian cults pentecost to call message calls you got calls everywhere but it doesn't take away from the truth amen and you always stay with the word when when a revelation will take you way out yonder you bring it right back here because this is the euro theorem this is the amen see what i'm saying isn't that true look look there in kings they were looking for elijah to return he never did but the prophets were they're not right listen they were looking where is he they knew he went and they were looking for him he never did return why the anointing that was on him amen was now on elisha amen they missed it just watch this is coming from the same message and knowing not and it's an urgency you hear him preach that message you need to listen to it amen i said is 8 15 65 and knoweth it not it's an sea he said just watch stay close to christ let me warn you now as a minister of the gospel of this don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're right in christ because that's the only thing that's going to cause we're in the most deceitful age that we ever lived in it would deceive the very elected if it was possible because they have anointing they can do anything like the rest of them clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man jesus said now i mean like your house renting stuff you got to do it get all the things off your hands get everything right make it ready get ready remember in the name of the lord something is fixing to happen amen amen y'all hear what i'm saying you hear what's happening it's an urgency and you say what do you mean you see whenever the prophet prophesied something it has to come to pass it may take a long time i think it was 400 years before isaiah prophecy came to pass about jesus but nothing can stop it because it's not the man that prophesying is god that's prophesying through the man hallelujah think about how long it took for isaiah nine and six behold unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father and the prince of peace it couldn't stop that word kept circling the earth throughout time until mary arrived hallelujah and then when mary arrived she didn't even know who she was hallelujah until the angel of god comes down and he visits her is that right she received a messenger and the messenger gave her her identity hallelujah pointed her back to the scripture of isaiah 9 right so you and i must understand this messenger gave us our identity hallelujah this is why he preached about mary and preaching about this thing she said lord how could i have a child hallelujah when i know no man hallelujah in other words i'm not a belong to a denomination i don't belong to an organization i don't know how it's going to be done lord how could it be he said this thing will be done by god himself he shall overshadow you the holy ghost that's what jesus who is god the holy ghost the angel said the holy ghost was god he shall overshadow you then he who's the father of jesus the holy ghost then it must be the holy ghost and the father it's the same person hallelujah is that right even when when when the bible tells us even according to matthew 1 23 he says behold a virgin shall be child with child and shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us then joseph being raised from the sleep did as the angel of the lord had bitten him see god had to even let joseph know amen what he was doing right because joseph want the killer hallelujah that was the law if your wife was caught amen in a fowl adultery act stoned her this is why this is why laodicea will be stoned the bible says amen that hail stones what what a hundred pounds amen will drop come on somebody you'll not know what a small rock feel like the head is gone right so it had to come to pass all the prophecies and you said what do you mean on the road to emmaus three men walked that way two men two men walked that way and they begged the third to stay and the third was jesus and the bible said they didn't know who he was he was raised from the dead like he said he would didn't he say it he broke the bread with them in in communion and he talked with them and he told them and then one day i'm going to die but on the third day i raise again i don't know where their minds were i don't know what their ads were because when it all happened they seem to have forgotten everything let me tell you something that's exactly what pressure will do amen if it's only in your head it's gone the only one that had it in his heart was john john never ran and john types the bride you see come to pressure bride won't run right she know who she is and the power of god will be with her don't you know everybody's crying for rain denominations lord give us the holy ghost the organization law the rain the bride is saying send the rain the rain must fall the rain is falling everywhere people are experiencing things they haven't experienced in a long time i'm saying all of these people so that you won't let the rain fall and you fail to get in it and allow it to get into you because this is deception satan is going to keep you as busy as he possibly can to keep you from praying because that's the way the way up is the way down [Laughter] praise the lord see there is a bride not just only is but there is a bride and she's moving right i think it was in 1962 when brother branham said you know that those stars amen came into alignment i got to quote he said hallelujah five stars have come into alignment remember in that time they thought the world was going to burst scientists was saying all kinds of crazy things it was the end of the world and all the things but what they did not know is that the heaven always declared what god is going to do on earth first when jesus that star appeared in heaven showed that the star of david the king of kings was to be born on earth hallelujah and when those five stars are lined up in 1962 amen it was the birth of the bride and remember this is what you need to see what i'm saying if that was the birth of the bride 1963 the seals were open so what was it she received the seals in her infancy she was not mature and it proved she wasn't mature because she handed the word in a matured way this is mine give it to me no give it to me it's mine i was there i was with the prophet you know they they carried on like children hallelujah and in all of that they were there preserving the word for all day now you say what do you mean brother brook see the prophet god knew he told him stand right here watch that rock look at it but they all moved in their own direction so they never caught the real revelation of what the message was that's why they started preaching god sent a prophet there's a time you should have preached that but now we're beyond that amen you know why why should we need we don't need to know where the prophet went and all the little stories he told i know i get in trouble for this but it's true what good is that going to do for you if you don't truly believe what he preached amen it's got to be life he said hallelujah we've got a five-star general spelling j-e-s-u-s placing five stars on us faith f-a-i-t-h he never lost the battle hallelujah he conquered death hell and the grave and if we can see that this picture even that we talked about the seven angels that was to show he's still conqueror he has already conquered laodicea [Music] he conquered it that's why the devil is so mad he's screaming because he knows that if the word of god has come there's somebody here to take it in he's scared of you because we know when the bride shows up his end is at hand amen that's why we see all this crazy stuff in politics it's insanity it truly is all around the world y'all think it's crazy here we're not in some of these other countries people can't discern right from wrong good from evil it's messed up let me finish this quote placing five stars on faith he never lost the battle hallelujah he conquered death hell in the grave he gave he get the he get the devil out of the way hallelujah he's the great chief captain so the devil isn't even in the picture [Music] the greatest battle was ever raged is setting right ready now y'all understand me people of god he did not say the best for last for nothing amen the anointing that we're going to get is far greater than any anointing hallelujah we've ever experienced it's beyond speaking in tongues it's beyond shouting and dancing it's authoritative anointing amen that's why brother said when when jesus was there standing before the podium and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled he said there was no no anointing like that he wasn't jumping and shouting but what was it he used that word with such an authority today marvel at him they couldn't figure them out they stared how can you say this thing is fulfilled we know who you are you marry son you was you was conceived in fornication you had this baby before you even uh you know was impregnated before you even got with joseph they understood they thought they did you came from galilee you know naturals and all this crazy stuff they had going on as rumors but he was a man who was even respected in his own country stood there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled we don't even know what we're dealing with we think that this is some fairy tale and you know so many people think well y'all good you guys you got to be in a cult well jesus was a man that they followed and was he occult to hmm no doubt they thought that see what they didn't understand he was a king and those subjects those ones who followed him knew he was a king they followed him because they were in his kingdom oh glory to god it's raging you say what do you mean brotherhood we must understand this message is no joke i know everybody has interpreted things that shouldn't have left alone because truly god interprets his own word and the bride of jesus christ when you don't understand something leave it amen god will interpret it to you he will un-give you the understanding because it's given to you to know the understanding of the scripture amen when i think of it when i stood and watched him do things see him reveal things open up you see what you see what he said he i said he's saying brother says i stood there and i saw him him who jesus christ when i think of it when i stood and watched him do things see him reveal things open up things say i'll be there be this way and that way and there it is it is oh look back here and say who is this great captain oh i don't look back and see if it's dr so-and-so i see the captain says he's the captain of our salvation hallelujah what is salvation deliverance glory he's the captain of our deliverance i'm trying to get to something the great hour of charge is at hand amen my god i didn't know what i was dreaming all i could say is it making it's clear to me now hallelujah soldiers were almost gleam me colored streaming faith and doubt is setting yourself in a ray and in this tabernacle this morning and doubt on one side faith on the other side soldiers standing at your post of duty hallelujah our captain the morning star leads on he never goes back he never don't know the word retreat don't have to retreat amen the greatest battle ever fought she's going on right in her now hey let me say it is the greatest battle ever fall she is going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt oh my brother between liberty and bondage the battle is on shine your spirit soldier polish up your armor god is getting his soldiers ready amen what are you saying what is he saying we're battling now right now this is this is your training between unbelief and faith hallelujah sickness and health these things that are hitting us it's for us it's for you to overcome them this is god working in you perfecting you bringing you into a place where you will be fit for this last battle amen we're not here to fight each other we're here to fight the devil and guess what we have already been decreed victorious now what happens he's just talking about how he says we see a roar in the papers across the television and out across the nations where five stars just fell in line with the word what five a number of grace every time those stars come then something happens on earth what's taking place five stars fell in what introducing what since then just look what's taking place germany almost washed off the map some of the magis in the world would say that the world would burst like a watermelon everything just stressful things prophecy by them and for the last days look what's taking place england the other day had a storm that blowed away seventy thousand houses one day disasters everywhere california los angeles like to wash into the ocean what is it beginning of sorrows earthquake has quick picked up everywhere why is it five stars come in line grace god's grace what happened an infant church a bride infancy that power of god has began to fall on her she's taking form a bride for this bridegroom the three stars meant his perfection and the heavenly father of the trinity become one on earth among us god offices become one office what happened now is the church of the living god coming together under the word of god and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach amen might not believe that but it's the word just the same the world is so behind and so are we god help us what happened he says i might say this friend the church has become is coming forth god moving to have a church without spot or wrinkle and she's predestinated god said so he will have it that makes it right who's a member i don't know i'm trusting to be myself i'm trusting you are a member but he's going to have a body without spot or wrinkle we can believe that or not but it is the truth and i don't mean in your imagination i mean in reality satan will have no power apparel over you this is what i loved about jesus before his death he says yes satan is coming he says satan is coming i know he's coming but he has nothing in me what was he saying i have no doctors in me that he can pull on to make me fall or come short and i'm doing this all for what you i'm doing it for my father because it was written of me that i must go to calvary [Music] and it's written that the bride must suffer he said we will suffer but we are overcome and i believe that these latter-day signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling peeling together to show that the christ is ready to come for his bride as god in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so is god and his word coming again making himself manifest in a bride you understand you hear the word i said manifest i didn't say claim it with your mouth it must be seen it must be manifested hallelujah about not not that will do like eve did hybrid it to something else but the unaddressed stand like jesus christ did with his spirit anointing in his word amen i believe it's the announcing now the prophet said there come a day that won't be called day nor night but in the evening time there shall be light all the bible readers know that what happened civilization traveled from the east to the west china is the oldest civilization we have civilization began in the east and it be went with the sun traveling west and you know we we see that well praise god the seals were opening was on sunset mountain hello sunset means the day is ending not only just night but that day is ending and so when the seals were opened it was showing the ending of something in the beginning of something because then he preached the word is the rising of the sun she showed there was a new day a new message a new word that was going to come which did come to prepare the bride of jesus christ for a rapture let me move on because i'm going to tell you something that you may not know maybe you do everybody's looking for the mysteries of the seals to be revealed out there when they fail to see that the mysteries of the seals must be revealed here see if christ is in you the secret is with him and he will reveal the secret as the in individuals those who have him on in the soul god will reveal the next move to you and like brother branham said even if you know it he has trained you so well till you won't tell nobody so when you got somebody well i know what i know let me tell you no it doesn't work that way because it's an individual thing and it's so personal to him right he shut the heavens up the angels stops singing holy holy holy no movement in heaven for a half hour and god brings you to a word to prepare you for a rapture the secret that moves through the bride is on let me say it like this did that still have any idea what she was doing she didn't even know god was working on her behalf but every move esther made was ordained by god now we can read it and we can see elsa and she had no idea she was a living word of god acting out prophecy that one day we'll be able to read her story and know the beginning from the end what about ruth and elsa and ruth are the two books of redemption she didn't know what god told me to do now it was no such thing as that it was an anointing it was a spirit it was god moving them into those channels to fulfill his thought for that day that one day we'll read that and be encouraged by that and understand so how when god elects you and choose you it doesn't matter what your nationality is on earth right amen now we must understand that the uh the nationality of our so-called inheritance uh you know i'm this and i'm that that's nonsense when you become born again you become a new race [Applause] your color means nothing to god ooh jesus y'all is this okay she is under the total leadership of the holy spirit you don't even know it and god is using you amen he can't tell you what he's doing we talk too much but he's using us everything runs out in time and that's what the seven seal did for us everything if you can't understand that something's wrong you know what i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this in my future future he said everything is running out how you go you don't even know when that final run out is but everything is running out it's coming to the end the church age the end of the seventh seal at the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials even at the end the ending of the ushering in the millennium that's on the seventh seal it's just like a firing rocket i want you to listen to this that's like a firing a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes here and it goes up and then explodes again and it puts forth put out five stars hallelujah and one of those stars explode and blows up five stars from it and then one of them stars explode and explode and blows out five stars from it see it fades on out what are you saying this message has been moving revelation after revelation after revelation this brother get in this brother get it that brother get it it's just been moving and moving and moving but somehow it's going to move on out but when it moves out it moves us with it that's what the seven seal leaders just ends up time for the world it ends up time for this it ends up time for that it is a time for this it ends up time it is the time everything that's ended up on the seventh seal see but the truth of our existence is being revealed to us now we never understood why we were such oddballs we didn't know who our in our true inheritance we we didn't understand it we couldn't understand why we had such a love and respect for the word we didn't understand it in spite of all our failures we didn't know but what happened is now is the prophet of the prophecy this is what's happening now the prophet the prophecy of the prophet is now becoming reality you are it amen amen you are it and you got to begin to get in your place make yourself ready stop the nonsense may god help me i tell you the truth uh what he anyway may god help me that's all i can say may god help us all the purpose is to prove we are not from satan's eden that we are the word bride of christ created by who him the word decree i'm almost done the word decree means to separate or divide and separate and destroy in other words everything satan has set in our way there's a word god has decreed that will never stop us you know when he said your virtuous bride and you never sin in the first place he was literally destroying satan by decreeing those things and everything every piece of darkness that will come before us those quotes those words that were spoken will vanquish every bit of it hallelujah because we'll come out victoriously there is no weapon formed against you that would prosper none nothing hallelujah even the way you were born it doesn't matter if you was born illegitimate it doesn't matter how you were born it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the blood of jesus christ washes away the blood of jesus christ justifies as the blood of jesus christ purifies hallelujah amen see i'm going to read this psalms 1 11 112 excuse me one through four this is what we call a decree praise ye the lord blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighted greatly in his commandments his seed shall might shall be mighty upon the earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endure forever until unto the upright there arises light in the darkness and he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous see that's a decree [Laughter] hallelujah praise the lord blessed is the man you hear what i'm saying so if you are a man that feareth the lord and delight amen in his commandments he said your seed shall be mighty upon the earth and when you pray you use this lord this is what you said about my seed is that all right and so now you're the seed of god so how much more that this applied to you when the devil comes and says you can't do it take him to the scripture you've been sermon you've been served all notice your devil right listen what he says i i'm trying to give it to you we'll say many think because they speak with tongues they've got the holy ghost that don't mean that though the holy ghost does speak with tongues but until that real genuine holy spirit in there will cope with every word if that holy spirit in you that makes you speak with tongues look back there and doesn't agree with the rest of the world then it's it's the wrong spirit it's got to come from the inside which is the word from the beginning in the in the beginning of the creation of god when god began to create bring you into existence you see you started back there as a seed and worked down to where you are now and then you were all in christ and when christ died he died to redeem all of you and you are a part of this word hallelujah and how can i see the bible see all of it precept precept line upon line here a little there little not one jotted little tittle shall fail how in the world can you being part of the world disagree with the rest of it or any part of it but now he's standing in the midst of the church age church i'm moving on as he said you you say you you how how can you be part of this and not deny any of it it's all true i don't care if you don't understand it it's all true amen because it is god hallelujah praise the lord but now as he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in the last day he calls himself the author of creation of god this is and this is what you got to understand leave it you got to die to this this flesh is not you this is of the old creation and what god is trying to get you to see he trying to create a new creation within you this is another creation that has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride and when we win throughout the church ages but now more than ever after your faith virtue you see it's him creating you in the spirit is that right because you've got to understand even in the beginning in genesis adam was first created spirit before he was created flesh and therefore god must proceed the same way he always have he must create himself spiritually in you first before they come a transformation of of this flesh you've got to change oh but it ain't you it's christ in you hallelujah the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride and as the spirit of god he comes down and created in the virgin mary the cell from which his body was born see he was the son of god he was a new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of his new creation he is the heart excuse me the head of the new church the new race gives me he is the head of the new race i'm jumping therefore if any man be in christ ii corinthians 5 17 he is a new creature all things old things have passed away behold all things become what knew there you can see the thought that that thought man was of the oh there you can see that though man was of the old uh old order or creation now is union with christ he has become the new creation of god ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus unto god good works ephesians 4 24 and that he put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness the new creation this is it the new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation is that right that's what we need to see in abraham and sarah it was not the old creation created over there were some dna changes hallelujah amen it was a new creation amen and shadow and time it is not it is another creation distinct ah i love that distinct you can tell the difference they don't look to say they don't act the same it's a distinct from one from the old one no longer is he dwelling dealing by way of the flesh that's was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issues through the garlic you understand he's no longer dealing with the flesh in other words his seed is everywhere it could be a drunkard a whoremonger a a a a drug addict it could be wherever it is he don't care about your lineage naturally he don't even care if you pod you because every jew got to be born again just like the gentile so what i'm trying to say we ought to be blessed we're blessed hallelujah i'm trying to hurry up folks i know i'm i'm not going to read all of this but listen let me tell you something that came from the exposition of the church ages as we said what god has done to us and god done for us we need to understand that we're now in in a warfare and god has given you power over this devil but understand you don't want to just have power over the devil because when those disciples came back and those sons of skiva this is the disciples says lord we we we we had power with the devil see denomination spirit the same holy ghost allowed them to cast out devils same holy ghost but you see the chosen seed that's you that's good all that's good but you want to make sure he comes into the holies of holies see that that's your way of escape that's the only way he's going to identify you'll be identified by the holy ghost in your soul the pentecostal people because they didn't have the truth they were many of them allowed to go and they'll make it because they were under that inspiration of the pentecost but now that the veil has been rent now that we can see the holy holy holy place we understand that god only dwells now in the soul that's what makes the rapture and the god of this evil age is demonic power and you must understand that this demonic power amen is no joke i mean it has filtrated the whole world through television is that right i mean that's that's where they the demons left when they they left uh uh russia i mean uh germany they they came and they they settled in hollywood and hollywood began to get their inspiration from demonic power and they spread the filth and the nonsense and the hatred of god and all that through hollywood and now the whole world has been polluted but you gotta now this is your time to prepare to escape let's not be foolish noah even knew it was going to rain but he didn't know when but he prepared for it didn't he right and let's not be like lot's wife got to be pulled out no we don't want to be poor we want to leave out and so you and i must understand by the grace of god amen that this thing is no joke and understand when god bring deliverance he bring a flood of some sort whether it be spiritually or naturally you've got to cross it you've got to come through it right noah built the ark they was able to cross over it right and there's an ark that had to go through the jordan right and a flood is a spiritual disturbance disturbance and the you know and the enemy's wrath is against you that's what we call a flood when the enemy comes in like a flood that spiritual wrath and satan is trying to consume you in every way he said the lord will lift up a standard in other words the demonic power mixed together you know uh you know we know the colors white red and black big horses power destroy what to see they're here to destroy the work of the holy ghost but they cannot and i'm trying to tell you something and i don't know how but i'm gonna go to this last quote and then i'm gonna let you go there's no way i can complete but i normally get too much going on anyway here but um i know i know for myself i'm crying out that god will not let me come short and take me all the way if there's only one person in this world that could be an example i believe this message with all my heart i hate i hate what it's become because of what men have done but i believe that god has given each and every one of us spiritual eyes to see that we've got to do more than what we're doing for ourselves right i mean it doesn't matter if we don't see this as he that we need to see this this is hard so change that we become slaves for the holy ghost our minds and our thoughts are gone we that's what we need we you know dead man can't think but that's the way we need to be that's what he's requiring a complete surrender dead to self and i think that i know it's not a thinking i know that's what he's requiring look what brother adam said and i'm closing with this quote what we are coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing game are we coming here meeting as a lodge it's christ can't come until the church is perfectly ready he's waiting on us i believe we're at the end look at in california look at the riots look at 19 people being killed racial didn't tell you here not long ago that martin luther king would lead the people into a massacre how many remember that it isn't them colored people it's them leading leaders stirring them up now i need you to listen to what i'm saying because this thing is on the uprise it is an integration segregation and whatever they want to call it it's the devil that's right not only to the white colored this is all of them its devils the mental faculties and reasoning of men is broke down there is no hope it's beyond hope the world uh the whole thing is petra petritated sores the mental faculties of man they can't make decisions i'm not a politician i don't neither i don't neither democrat or republican they're all filthy i for i'm for one kingdom and that's the kingdom of jesus christ that's all but how in the world did you ever see a bunch of puppets like we got up there now like the church of like the bunch of texans we've got in there why they say whatever the people want if they want communism we'll give them communism if they want integration we'll give them integration want segregation we'll give whatever she did where is a man oh god that's like the puppet where is man man that man that stands for principle where is a woman that stands for a principal where is the church that stands for a principle i ain't got a nickel worth of time for wishy-washy giving in compromising spirit a woman is a woman let her be lady if a man is a man let him be man and so i'm i'm i'm closing out with that uh there's a lot of things you know what brother brahm said he said adam took life of fellowship and joy with god and turned it into a desert of spiritual darkness that brought forth all sin more decay pain suffering delusion and corruption that that wars within the soul of men adam did that by doing what breaking one word so i i say this by the grace of god if you can't see that you are the prophecy you're the one to fulfill the prophecy that's been prophesied then you're missing the whole thing if you can't see that god has more for you to do than to sit at mcdonald's or go to restaurants and we all do but there's more to it than that if you can't see that god is trying to raise up a supernatural race a supernatural people a supernatural army then you're missing it whether you be male or female you must understand by god's grace that god brought us here for a purpose and i'm i'm just paraphrasing some of my notes and that is to put satan under our feet the whole purpose of the bible is about his bride and you're it people help pray for me and i'll pray for you you know when when you start talking about cleaning up your life and getting right with god a lot of times people don't want that but you ain't going to heaven without it dying to yourself everybody think they got rights you ain't got no rights when you come to god none you got to die to everything you think you have a right to that's from the pulpit to the back of the door until you're willing to die and suffer none of us don't wanna survive i ain't gotta take that no you really don't but a true lamb will lay it down amen let's stand it is what it is i don't even know whether anyway i'll just leave it as a way but i know one thing always keep in mind god interprets his own word men we get in ourselves and we think we know what god wants but something's gonna happen you know what only the bride is gonna be able to see it other people gonna think it's fanaticism is that right i mean come on when jesus rode into nazareth the pharisees and sadducees they stood there said who is this when the people on the ground the poor begley people were saying hosanna hold on a blessing is he that comes in the name of the lord you see you got those who see and those who can't see always thank god for your sight you can't make them see only god gives sight to the blind and i trust that god keep my eyes and my heart open to receive everything that he has for me do i get scared i get scared sometimes that may not be the right word to say i don't know how to say express myself but i do know one thing i believe without i believe in bride but i can look and see where i have not been faithful or as faithful as i could be to his word and i want to be a hundred percent in everything i really do want to be 100 i don't want to leave this earth without pleasing him [Music] and all of us especially those of us who of age on us we feel the pains of death sometimes we feel it just getting up out of a chair or sitting down in one and we know that our time is close whether it be by death or by a rapture that's how i'm feeling and i don't want to be one of those people who assumed they had what it would have took and then wake up in a region of the loss of some sort i'm taking it more seriously now than i've ever have because i realize that the day that we're living in and i know that the time is so so short so much closer than when we first believe and i trust by god's grace that god will envision give us the vision of what we're talking about but i know one thing the lord is not finished with the bride she will not go out looking like she's looking she'll be a real army like ezekiel said lord can these dry bones live yes but prophesy there's coming a move and his move is already on and every everyone that's part of the move feel the pull and i'm so grateful for that give me a key of c brother [Music] and i began to cry [Music] [Music] exactly why i can't explain with tongue or pin the spirits deep within it must be god here in my soul cause i feel [Music] lord i hear your [Music] and i know the spear is moving me to give he speaks to me [Music] lord and i agree
