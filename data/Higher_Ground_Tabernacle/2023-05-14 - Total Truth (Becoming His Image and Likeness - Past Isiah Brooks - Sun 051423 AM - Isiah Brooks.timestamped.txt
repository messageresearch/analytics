[50:54] foreign
[51:00] [Music]
[51:11] God is good
[51:14] we appreciate him
[51:17] a service is not a service
[51:19] without the Holy Spirit
[51:24] I appreciate the song service center and
[51:28] those of you who were here too
[51:30] enjoy and to Worship the Lord
[51:35] we appreciate everything you do
[51:40] as some may say
[51:43] I'm on the emotional side
[51:47] and I'm glad to be that way
[51:52] I I love it when the Holy Spirit touches
[51:55] me
[51:56] I love it when I feel his presence
[52:00] I love it when I can express him
[52:04] as brother Brandon said that is that
[52:07] kind of Glory probably
[52:08] and if you are in service and you can't
[52:11] feel himself
[52:24] and he wants to uh make you aware
[52:28] that not only is
[52:36] everywhere
[52:37] there's no escape
[52:40] from his presence and I don't care what
[52:44] you go through foreign
[52:52] as a service this morning the word this
[52:54] morning
[52:56] will reach of your hearts I believe with
[53:01] all my heart the message that I'm going
[53:02] to
[53:03] preaching
[53:05] otherwise I wouldn't be here
[53:11] I tried to bring a message
[53:13] something that I know that God wants you
[53:16] to know many of us amen it's like we
[53:19] forget
[53:20] God prepares the table
[53:23] amen and sometimes we set among at the
[53:27] table so we pushes certain things
[53:31] if he has set the table
[53:34] that means you expect for you to eat
[53:39] and of course he doesn't force the issue
[53:43] at the end of the day we all will
[53:47] realize that God did all that he
[53:51] promised
[54:00] you know we uh
[54:03] appreciate all the mothers
[54:07] America is celebrating Mother's Day
[54:12] really Mother's Day is every day
[54:16] almost 24 hours a day
[54:20] and we appreciate every mother
[54:24] my wife
[54:26] raising eight children four I I
[54:30] appreciate her
[54:32] and you know by my way of appreciating
[54:35] her is not by words only
[54:39] but but Deeds things that we do
[54:44] to make her know that someone loved amen
[54:48] appreciate it yeah
[54:50] amen so you know because even in
[54:53] marriage
[54:54] sometimes the enemy comes and he tries
[54:56] to affect attack us
[54:59] with whether we love each other or Not
[55:04] by God's grace
[55:06] that our love is Beyond skin deep
[55:11] Skin Deep
[55:13] so Genesis
[55:16] 26 and 27.7
[55:21] trust you don't mind me taking this
[55:23] jacket off
[55:35] and God said
[55:38] let us make man in our image
[55:41] after our likeness
[55:44] and let them have dominion over the fish
[55:48] and of the sea
[55:50] and over the fall of the air and over
[55:52] the cattle and over all the Earth
[55:54] and over every creeping thing that
[55:57] creepeth upon the Earth is
[56:08] [Music]
[56:11] so God created man in his own image
[56:15] in the image of God created he
[56:19] him as
[56:26] male and female created he them is
[56:32] let us pray
[56:35] our dear heavenly father
[56:37] we once again approach your holy Throne
[56:40] we thank you for your goodness we thank
[56:44] you for the grace that you have
[56:46] bestowed upon us
[56:49] Lord you have given us
[56:52] the opportunity to be here and we are
[56:56] most grateful
[56:58] for what you have done for us
[57:01] Lord we pray that your uh uh yo yo you
[57:07] would have preeminence in the service
[57:11] I trust that you would give us Grace to
[57:14] move completely out of your way
[57:17] oh my God that the people will know that
[57:21] they have heard from you in your name
[57:23] Jesus Christ
[57:25] amen you may be seated
[57:31] my subject is
[57:34] becoming His Image and likeness
[57:38] I have a subtopic which is entitled
[57:43] um
[57:52] we are at a time
[57:58] what we call Harvest
[58:01] there's a time where all the seeds that
[58:04] have been planted
[58:07] has come to a mature state
[58:11] so much
[58:13] uh whatever they are whatever they were
[58:17] as seeds now
[58:29] for example for example if you showing
[58:33] if they're wheat and if there's tear is
[58:37] at the Harvest time
[58:40] that you can distinguish the difference
[58:44] between the two
[58:46] while they're growing
[58:52] but there's one thing about the wheat
[58:56] that we can do something
[59:03] at the Harvest of the wheat
[59:07] the wheat bows is
[59:14] a proud Critter
[59:18] he doesn't know how to bow
[59:22] we have what we call the table set us is
[59:25] that before us
[59:28] is that what uh Psalm says 23. this is
[59:32] set the table before us
[59:36] in the presence of my enemies I love
[59:40] that because often time we think the
[59:44] trials that we go through
[59:46] we think sometimes but God does not know
[59:50] or understand
[59:52] we failed to see that God is the one who
[59:56] set the table
[59:58] the Bride of Jesus Christ has come to be
[1:00:02] tried if you've come to be tested
[1:00:06] Hallelujah and according to the word of
[1:00:09] John
[1:00:10] we are children of the day
[1:00:13] children
[1:00:15] we are not children of the darkness
[1:00:19] Hallelujah so I hope by God's grace
[1:00:28] and
[1:00:30] bring you as an individual to a
[1:00:34] conclusion
[1:00:40] hey man
[1:00:42] it is so easy it's a democracy to
[1:00:45] misplace Jesus
[1:00:49] so much so Mary then
[1:00:52] and Joseph Joseph misplaced him
[1:00:57] and when they come to find out
[1:01:02] he wasn't with them
[1:01:05] they panicked
[1:01:07] and went everywhere looking for Jesus
[1:01:13] but when they returned to the place they
[1:01:17] left him
[1:01:18] that's when they found him
[1:01:21] like brother Branham said that's what's
[1:01:25] happened
[1:01:26] denominations that's what happened to
[1:01:29] organizations
[1:01:31] I fear that that's what has happened to
[1:01:35] many of us in the message
[1:01:38] we're looking for Jesus
[1:01:40] where is Jesus and I'll tell you where
[1:01:44] he's at
[1:01:45] he's right there where you left him
[1:01:49] and in order to find him you got to go
[1:01:53] back where back to the place
[1:01:56] where you left him
[1:01:58] now the message of the hour has come to
[1:02:02] put us back in order
[1:02:05] is that right as we have been working
[1:02:08] about order
[1:02:09] the whole thing is taken out of order
[1:02:16] is that right
[1:02:18] when Adam and Eve
[1:02:24] and you know one thing about this chaos
[1:02:28] sometimes well feels like it's
[1:02:31] Everlasting
[1:02:33] I don't know whether Adam could see
[1:02:37] this day
[1:02:42] because I'll say it like this there has
[1:02:45] never been a day
[1:02:47] like this day
[1:02:49] uh so much Soul Brother
[1:02:52] call this age
[1:02:55] the evil age
[1:02:57] and he said the God of this evil
[1:03:02] since I don't remember that means
[1:03:05] everybody
[1:03:09] and they are worshiping the devil Diablo
[1:03:14] everybody
[1:03:15] except the bride except
[1:03:19] we must put God in his proper place
[1:03:23] the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is
[1:03:27] the head of the church
[1:03:29] that means he is the head of the wife
[1:03:33] hello somebody that means we are we must
[1:03:37] be subjects
[1:03:40] and Jesus Christ is the word
[1:03:46] hallelujah see there won't be another
[1:03:49] church
[1:03:55] y'all hear what I'm saying so let me say
[1:03:58] it like this to you

[1:06:32] Hallelujah and the script it tells us
[1:06:34] that they cannot be completed
[1:06:41] there's something that God has in store
[1:06:45] for us
[1:06:49] that frustrates
[1:06:52] frustrates the issue is that everybody
[1:06:56] is waiting on God

[1:24:09] sin
[1:24:10] cannot sin
[1:24:12] it's not even imputed what David said
[1:24:17] blessed is a man God will not impute sin

[1:24:30] and I'm
[1:24:32] not a matter of fact I'm I'm pretty much

[1:25:18] done so much
[1:25:23] like you've seen me say if I held this
[1:25:27] piece of paper up in front of you and I
[1:25:31] ask you what do you see

[1:28:10] listen this is the key when you're in
[1:28:13] Christ
[1:28:16] when you're in Christ and see this is
[1:28:19] where we we have been taught
[1:28:22] me hybrid the message
[1:28:27] in so many places
[1:28:29] like the Baptist Doctrine if you believe
[1:28:33] God is the prophet you got it
[1:28:42] you got it
[1:29:09] you can understand all Mysteries
[1:29:21] and then some of y'all are going to
[1:29:22] teach our wives they don't need to know
[1:29:24] the scripture

[1:29:57] to do
[1:29:59] you say well brother what are you saying

[1:30:03] who have child children
[1:30:06] they're not even safe don't know Jesus
[1:30:09] so that means do that means that they're
[1:30:12] saved because they have a lot of babies
[1:30:16] balance it out
[1:30:18] whoever told you that Jesus understood
[1:30:21] that one um
[1:30:23] Hallelujah

[1:31:35] because I know this is what he gave me
[1:31:38] hallelujah how do you know come over
[1:31:41] yourself
[1:31:42] discrepancy in this message
[1:31:45] itself
[1:31:52] that's why we don't see the Miracles
[1:31:57] we don't see the the Supernatural
[1:32:01] is that right because the Bible says it
[1:32:05] is
[1:32:11] you're better than me

[1:56:49] that day
[1:56:51] that centered around the true God
[1:56:55] and the worship of him
[1:56:58] though they did not worship according to
[1:57:02] truth
[1:57:04] they didn't go all the way
[1:57:09] so he liken you as Judas
[1:57:11] if you don't go all the way
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:17] and there is no way you can say I got
[1:57:20] the Holy Ghost and there is no change in

[1:57:29] you know you know there's so many y'all
[1:57:31] some of y'all people that struggle y'all

[1:57:34] all together right
[1:57:41] I don't know what that's right I mean I

[1:57:47] a serpent to me
[1:57:49] and I'm gonna say it just like I feel
[1:57:51] it's really just sound like a serpent to
[1:57:53] me
[1:57:55] God

[1:57:59] you're not you're not gonna surely die
[1:58:02] yeah yeah yeah you're gonna die
[1:58:05] yes sir some of y'all some of y'all
[1:58:09] don't even believe that the Bible is
[1:58:10] fully right
[1:58:16] do you realize that the Bible is right
[1:58:23] God is stupid
[1:58:27] the Bible says foreign
[1:58:35] [Applause]
[1:58:44] yeah amen
[1:58:47] I don't understand it all I know the
[1:58:50] Bible says repent and be baptized in the
[1:58:54] name of Jesus Christ
[1:58:56] and you shall receive the gift of holy
[1:58:59] ghosts how do you know it's right
[1:59:01] because I repented I was baptized and I
[1:59:06] got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[1:59:10] Hallelujah
[1:59:14] [Applause]
[1:59:21] let me tell you something even this eye
[1:59:26] yeah I'm not going to go through the
[1:59:27] whole story but it gave me a lot of
[1:59:29] problems with my life
[1:59:32] I didn't talk to God first
[1:59:40] you run into the doctor before
[1:59:46] when did the doctors become more
[1:59:48] important than God
[1:59:52] out of getting down on your knees and
[1:59:53] praying he said that's what the early
[1:59:55] church did this is
[1:59:58] the positions give us all of his points
[2:00:07] lean not to your own understanding
[2:00:11] you acknowledge the Lord in all your
[2:00:13] ways
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:26] Hallelujah I screamed that out down and
[2:00:28] forgot where I was
[2:00:32] amen you love the Lord let me hurry up
[2:00:35] because I know
[2:00:38] like Judas they didn't go all the way
[2:00:41] see how Judas was chosen of God
[2:00:45] he was instructed in truth
[2:00:49] oh I'm chosen chosen no meaning
[2:00:54] see what you're chosen to do excuse me
[2:00:57] the questions
[2:01:01] the message should be in you the Bible
[2:01:04] said you are ridden pistols
[2:01:09] you and I are supposed to be the
[2:01:12] expressions
[2:01:18] yes in other words you know we shouldn't
[2:01:21] be like later to see if we can say
[2:01:23] but every day instead of praising him
[2:01:26] we're complaining it should be this and
[2:01:31] you look at the church and oh my God he
[2:01:33] should have done it this way of course
[2:01:35] he didn't preach it exactly right
[2:01:38] you know what God hear oh yeah all that
[2:01:40] and I'm gonna tell you you don't have to
[2:01:42] answer to me
[2:01:46] Hallelujah
[2:01:48] a lot of time you say those things and
[2:01:51] you think he's gonna get away
[2:01:56] my mom used to tell me that
[2:01:59] God go slow walk you boy
[2:02:04] and God will take a few steps and he's
[2:02:07] right there with you
[2:02:10] and the only way getting out of judgment
[2:02:12] you got repent you got to make things
[2:02:20] that's if you got the Holy Ghost
[2:02:26] history
[2:02:44] he shared knowledge of the Mysteries
[2:02:58] in Jesus name but when The Showdown came
[2:03:02] man
[2:03:04] he sold out for gold and political power
[2:03:09] Hallelujah he did not go to Pentecost
[2:03:13] the Holy Spirit or the spirit of God
[2:03:17] hallelujah he was devoid of the spirit
[2:03:22] make no mistake about it a person that
[2:03:26] is
[2:03:27] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[2:03:31] of Christ receiving the fullness of the
[2:03:34] spirit will be in the words
[2:03:41] that is the evidence of being baptized
[2:03:45] with the Holy Ghost did you hear what he
[2:03:47] said that is
[2:03:54] [Music]
[2:04:01] [Applause]
[2:04:10] think about that
[2:04:15] that's from the church age
[2:04:27] you know how you're going to know how
[2:04:30] you going
[2:04:30] what is the word and what is tradition
[2:04:33] if you don't read your words
[2:04:39] and we incorporate Traditions into the
[2:04:42] word of ourselves
[2:04:58] can you imagine
[2:05:01] Paul had to go through
[2:05:04] when he told those Jews all your
[2:05:08] traditions
[2:05:13] did he run into opposition
[2:05:16] absolutely absolutely you mean to tell
[2:05:20] me
[2:05:21] that these Gentiles don't need to be
[2:05:24] circumcised
[2:05:26] no no they don't no that's your
[2:05:30] tradition
[2:05:31] Hallelujah God is beyond that
[2:05:36] Hallelujah come on somebody it's the
[2:05:39] truth and you know that's what people
[2:05:41] don't understand
[2:05:43] when you're born again you're born into
[2:05:46] the kingdom of God hallelujah
[2:05:49] so let me move
[2:05:51] on about that and traditions were
[2:05:56] better than the Gentiles
[2:06:00] Hallelujah and when Paul saw Peter
[2:06:03] on the table of the Gentiles
[2:06:11] call him a hypocrite
[2:06:13] and said you made the School of none
[2:06:16] effects
[2:06:18] we've been doing in this message
[2:06:35] come into perfection
[2:06:39] Hallelujah
[2:06:41] you know I really don't care so he's
[2:06:43] just like I'm at a point right now she's
[2:06:45] trying unemployment no you know if I if
[2:06:47] if everybody left and found another
[2:06:51] church it won't bother me like that
[2:06:54] because I asked God for genuine
[2:06:56] Christians
[2:07:00] now I'm not here playing church I don't
[2:07:02] just I don't see that happen too many
[2:07:03] times I want somebody who loved the
[2:07:06] words
[2:07:09] Hallelujah and somebody when you know
[2:07:12] you wrong make it right
[2:07:27] you know
[2:07:29] the wife covered for the husband
[2:07:35] she covered his sins
[2:07:37] and you know what God did he says he
[2:07:40] killed them both Elizabeth
[2:07:46] shout down in heaven yeah he killed them
[2:07:50] both you can't lie for your husband
[2:07:53] you can't lie for your sister
[2:08:04] you know
[2:08:08] oh Lord get him out of that Pulpit y'all
[2:08:10] somebody help him help me
[2:08:15] I love you people I love you
[2:08:17] I hate the term new people but I love
[2:08:20] all of you
[2:08:22] I wouldn't be preaching like I'm not
[2:08:24] trying to say
[2:08:27] but I stand with the words
[2:08:32] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Oh
[2:08:36] Sister Amy that that was wonderful I
[2:08:38] needed
[2:08:39] I needed that let go and let God have
[2:08:43] his way
[2:08:45] Jesus and I was going to let him have
[2:08:47] his way out of them
[2:08:49] she interrupted the words
[2:08:57] that was the anointing
[2:09:00] this is his service not mine
[2:09:05] that's all I'm saying because you know
[2:09:08] y'all get the see that's that's the only
[2:09:09] thing about conduct and all that I don't
[2:09:11] like let's just like because conduct and
[2:09:13] order was given to bring you know
[2:09:16] brother Branham never did it that way
[2:09:22] so much so unto the church now is dead
[2:09:29] because they shut the Holy Spirit out
[2:09:32] um
[2:09:34] that's not what it was given for is
[2:09:40] let me hit one more thing and I'll try
[2:09:43] I'll try to close it out
[2:09:44] how you know they lied
[2:09:47] teachers and everybody else
[2:09:49] you know because they say you receive
[2:09:52] the Holy Ghost you can receive the holy
[2:09:54] ghosts
[2:09:57] um
[2:10:03] because let me tell you the truth or the
[2:10:05] bad ears when they spoke on the day of
[2:10:07] Pentecost
[2:10:14] and all the stuff that you see
[2:10:16] Pentecostals doing
[2:10:18] speaking in tongues and nobody know what
[2:10:20] this is
[2:10:23] they don't know whether they blessing
[2:10:25] God
[2:10:27] hallelujah but on the day of Pentecost
[2:10:30] when the holy ghost fails they
[2:10:33] understood
[2:10:34] that's what they said
[2:10:38] so how's those tongues that they've got
[2:10:41] now the same tongs they had on the day
[2:10:44] of Pentacles
[2:10:51] is it dead
[2:10:53] okay
[2:10:55] how long has been dead brother
[2:11:02] okay
[2:11:03] I'm looking for
[2:11:07] I don't have much longer that might
[2:11:10] tired I'm tired of Mike out again
[2:11:18] but just just you know we only have
[2:11:20] service for most of y'all on win on
[2:11:22] Sundays anyhow even the whole selfies
[2:11:25] so I double it up I'll give you a
[2:11:28] Wednesday and a Sunday
[2:11:32] Marshall no I'm not talking about to
[2:11:34] those people who can't come um
[2:11:39] the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost
[2:11:51] Hallelujah so what is it that they got
[2:11:54] over there
[2:11:56] you know brother Brandon said it like
[2:11:58] this is one day you're gonna realize
[2:12:01] they were worshiping the devils
[2:12:06] hmm
[2:12:08] you can tell the world about this anyway
[2:12:14] modern Pentecostals say
[2:12:17] I just read that that they can receive
[2:12:20] the Holy Ghost in unknown tongues
[2:12:24] they have the card before the horse he's
[2:12:27] on the the la la la la
[2:12:30] for in Acts 2 the people spoke in a
[2:12:34] perfect dialect which even unbelievers
[2:12:38] heard remembers understood
[2:12:42] Hallelujah this is a quote
[2:12:45] let me move on now when God is silent we
[2:12:50] had better be silent but where he has
[2:12:53] spoken we had better speak to us and say
[2:12:58] what he has already said
[2:13:00] he told us the evidence or what would
[2:13:04] happen after being baptized with the
[2:13:07] Holy Ghost was that we would have the
[2:13:10] teacher come and teach all true
[2:13:13] but that teacher was an inside teacher
[2:13:18] not an outside teacher if the spirit
[2:13:22] wasn't inside
[2:13:23] you wouldn't hear the truth and receive
[2:13:27] it by Revelation if you heard it every
[2:13:31] moment of the day did you hear what he
[2:13:33] said if it's not in you you cannot
[2:13:37] receive it and you won't hear it no
[2:13:40] matter how he preaches
[2:13:42] Hallelujah that was the sign of the
[2:13:46] indwelling spirit in the days of Paul
[2:13:55] and you know why I ask you is why do you
[2:13:58] quote Paul
[2:14:02] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:14:04] and forever
[2:14:05] people don't like me quoting brother
[2:14:08] Brown
[2:14:11] you need the Holy Ghost episode or need
[2:14:14] to find a church where they don't quote
[2:14:16] him
[2:14:26] it's been revealed
[2:14:30] man I'm sorry you don't see it
[2:14:33] yeah
[2:14:34] I don't understand it it's not my fault
[2:14:36] it's about my face
[2:14:39] Hallelujah
[2:14:43] see that's where so many people
[2:14:46] Traditions
[2:14:49] let me tell you something you got
[2:14:51] millions of people in this world
[2:14:54] whatever the Pope says
[2:14:58] and the pope gonna have no Supernatural
[2:15:14] and the mafia
[2:15:18] keeping him from getting hurt uh
[2:15:22] you know what brother Brandon had so
[2:15:24] it's Harvey he had Angels
[2:15:30] I'm almost done people then y'all can go
[2:15:33] eat your Mother's Day dinner
[2:15:36] just in a minute
[2:15:39] because I want y'all to get out I know
[2:15:40] y'all gonna get out here and talk about
[2:15:42] me so if I just think this is now
[2:15:45] if the spirit wasn't inside see there's
[2:15:48] something you wouldn't hear the truth
[2:15:50] and receive about Revelation if you
[2:15:53] heard it every moment of the day that
[2:15:56] was a sign of the indwelling in the days
[2:15:59] of Paul let me say it like this
[2:16:02] let me interject this they did not have
[2:16:05] a Bible
[2:16:07] but they had the Holy Ghost
[2:16:10] and so when the word was preached or
[2:16:13] sent to them by letter forms
[2:16:20] that's how I know brother Brandon this
[2:16:22] message
[2:16:29] Hallelujah
[2:16:30] glory to God Roger I'll get carried away
[2:16:33] let me hurry
[2:16:36] Hallelujah those who did not have the
[2:16:38] spirit heard it only as a count of men
[2:16:42] put a wrong interpretation on it and
[2:16:46] went into sins
[2:16:48] every age and every age is the age of
[2:16:52] the Holy Ghost for the True Believer
[2:16:55] I say in every age the evidence was the
[2:17:01] who had the spirits whichever is the
[2:17:04] teacher with a capital T heard the word
[2:17:07] and the spirit in them took the word
[2:17:13] revealed to them and they were of the
[2:17:17] group is that heard the messenger and
[2:17:21] his message
[2:17:29] that's it I'ma stop there
[2:17:33] almost
[2:17:34] I just want to say something
[2:17:37] you know because listen I I we don't
[2:17:40] understand and I know a lot of people
[2:17:41] don't understand my position
[2:17:44] but I have to give it a count
[2:17:47] all the things that I say and everything
[2:17:50] in this church
[2:17:53] and and and I have a given account for
[2:17:55] your souls
[2:17:59] and for those of you who I I'm not your
[2:18:02] pastor
[2:18:03] then I guess you don't have to listen
[2:18:06] but for those of you who I am pastors
[2:18:10] I am your pastor I trust that you have
[2:18:13] ears to hear Hallelujah
[2:18:17] my question is where is your Covenant
[2:18:20] I mean where's the proof of it
[2:18:25] you know here I am still preaching on on
[2:18:27] coming to town on time
[2:18:31] they're people who've only paid since
[2:18:34] they've been here years paid their
[2:18:35] tithes maybe once or twice
[2:18:50] and when they preach on Queen of Sheba
[2:18:54] everybody's up out of here
[2:18:56] but Queen of Sheba brought everything
[2:19:00] I'm saying but if this man preached the
[2:19:02] truth I'm backing his ministries
[2:19:09] just to sit up in this church and do
[2:19:12] nothing
[2:19:13] well we want Deacons
[2:19:28] Hallelujah you don't hardly give I've
[2:19:30] seen big grown men give a Dollar too
[2:19:35] loud shame on you
[2:19:38] you give McDonald's more offering than
[2:19:40] you do God and God gives you more food
[2:19:43] than McDonald's
[2:19:47] Hallelujah
[2:19:51] I don't mean no harm people
[2:19:55] don't don't be offended but I'ma say it
[2:19:57] anyway but you say Brother Bruce will
[2:19:59] you come pray for my house
[2:20:04] I'm worthy enough to bless your house
[2:20:10] God is not worthy enough for you to pay
[2:20:15] party
[2:20:16] themes anyway
[2:20:20] and then you you say well
[2:20:22] he don't want no deacons because
[2:20:24] he's afraid that you're gonna steal
[2:20:30] you ain't paying your tires and you're
[2:20:32] stealing already
[2:20:35] you're just not stealing it from me
[2:20:37] you're stealing it from God
[2:20:43] Hallelujah anyhow
[2:20:46] amen hallelujah I just wrote some notes
[2:20:49] down it's going to be cutting but I'm
[2:20:52] gonna say it yeah
[2:20:54] if I'm not your pastor
[2:20:56] and if you can't find it to back this
[2:20:59] ministry
[2:21:01] financially if you don't sell more by
[2:21:03] paying your tithing and offerings which
[2:21:06] is your reasonable service really
[2:21:11] I need you to find another charge
[2:21:14] we pay electricity here
[2:21:17] every time you flush to commode that's
[2:21:19] water
[2:21:25] it's true see these lights somebody got
[2:21:28] to pay these bills
[2:21:32] right
[2:21:33] my son movies
[2:21:36] foreign
[2:21:51] now I'm being carnal let me know in the
[2:21:53] natural the only natural but we had to
[2:21:55] put up curtains up there Hallelujah
[2:21:58] with money
[2:22:02] that doesn't even come to this church we
[2:22:05] put all of this up

[2:22:11] money I'm not begging for your money I'm

[2:22:20] you you're gonna get away with it
[2:22:23] God will sort you he's gonna
[2:22:27] he's gonna listen and when it comes
[2:22:30] don't ask me to pray for you

[2:22:44] because we gonna need each other
[2:22:47] oh right now it ain't so tight right now
[2:22:50] but it's coming
[2:22:59] so where else

[2:23:13] parents that won't even bring their kids

[2:23:54] them the importance of being in the
[2:23:58] image and likeness of God
[2:24:00] the greatest honors
[2:24:03] creation to be made in the image and
[2:24:06] likeness of God

[2:25:19] hands
[2:25:20] and what you're gonna find out is the
[2:25:23] Holy Ghost is going to leave you
[2:25:25] because this body that is you are now
[2:25:29] living in is not your own lives about
[2:25:33] Tampa
[2:25:35] defiling the body of God
[2:25:38] um
[2:25:39] defiling the body of God
[2:25:42] desires
[2:25:44] sorry I'm almost done we don't have to
[2:25:48] talk about fornication y'all know that's
[2:25:51] wrong but accusing the elders
[2:25:55] or you know we do that Hallelujah
[2:26:00] if I see somebody qualify we'll put them
[2:26:03] there
[2:26:04] but I'm gonna tell you now
[2:26:07] if you're a deacon you're not gonna be
[2:26:10] drinking wine
[2:26:14] and you're gonna pay your tithing

[2:26:19] your tires
[2:26:21] well what you know y'all looking at me
[2:26:23] because I think the tires ain't coming
[2:26:25] no no no no that's not what I'm thinking
[2:26:27] you're cursed
[2:26:30] how can I bless something that's already
[2:26:33] occurred
[2:26:34] you said well
[2:26:36] can I know I I can't be cursed I got
[2:26:39] clothes

[2:26:49] they had a greater blessing than you
[2:26:52] their clothes didn't wear out the shoes
[2:26:55] didn't go bad
[2:26:57] and they still was cursed
[2:27:01] so you don't go by your natural
[2:27:03] appearance
[2:27:05] I'm almost done I know y'all gonna be
[2:27:08] glad but I'm almost done
[2:27:12] like I said earlier the shepherd will
[2:27:14] follow the Sheep

[2:28:26] that's all right
[2:28:28] the Church of the Living God
[2:28:31] oh we live for God and not for ourselves
[2:28:37] you all right with that
[2:28:42] as I said earlier and I'm close
[2:28:45] yeah it's not like I want somebody to
[2:28:48] leave
[2:28:50] because I want you to get right
[2:28:52] [Music]
[2:28:54] you understand me you're hindering the
[2:28:57] church
[2:28:59] I think it was Brother Rich and I was
[2:29:02] talking supposed to differ Richard and
[2:29:04] people have attended to say
[2:29:07] don't affect anybody that's wrong that's
[2:29:12] not true
[2:29:13] a can
[2:29:36] that they were connected
[2:29:40] Hallelujah and we're connected to each
[2:29:43] other
[2:29:44] is that right
[2:29:46] and hidden sin
[2:29:49] will call somebody
[2:29:51] to lose their victory
[2:29:56] that's brother Brandon said this 400g
[2:30:01] that government reiterate this this is
[2:30:04] not a Congolese Church neither is it in
[2:30:07] America
[2:30:08] this is not a Catholic church where you
[2:30:11] can add to your Creeds and dogs
[2:30:19] this is the Church of the of of of the
[2:30:22] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:30:24] he cares nothing about your tradition it
[2:30:28] is your tradition that makes the word of
[2:30:30] God of none effects
[2:30:32] it's not if it's not the Church of Jesus
[2:30:37] Christ
[2:30:37] then we are just a foreign
[2:31:01] God cannot solve problems
[2:31:07] God solves everything
[2:31:09] ask them
[2:31:11] happy
[2:31:16] and all I'm asking especially Brethren
[2:31:19] if you come to be a part of this church
[2:31:24] then you need to join me in the battle
[2:31:29] shoulder to shoulder
[2:31:33] A House Divided can't stand
[2:31:36] um
[2:31:39] nobody you you ever see me trying to be
[2:31:41] something great in here
[2:31:44] I tried to be your brother I tried to be
[2:31:47] your friend
[2:31:49] Hallelujah there's not one person in
[2:31:51] here that can ever say that you need it
[2:31:54] and I didn't come to your rescue
[2:32:01] I have never been prejudiced against
[2:32:03] anybody right
[2:32:08] even though I know remember that you
[2:32:11] don't you don't completely agree with me
[2:32:13] [Music]
[2:32:15] that's not my concern
[2:32:17] right because no man see eye to eye
[2:32:21] but I am concerned about you agreeing
[2:32:25] with the word measures
[2:32:30] right brother Brandon said hold on G if
[2:32:33] a church don't believe in drinking wine
[2:32:35] I'm using this for example
[2:32:38] he used other illustrations he said and
[2:32:42] even if I believe that I could it
[2:32:45] Dimensions he said I wouldn't do it
[2:32:47] because the church don't believe we
[2:32:50] should
[2:32:52] that's what divine loves do
[2:32:55] you have a freedom and maybe your
[2:32:57] conscience don't bother you
[2:32:59] but I'll give you one suggestion
[2:33:04] and I know it ain't always the brothers
[2:33:06] I see y'all sisters y'all be doing a
[2:33:10] little something yourselves
[2:33:12] I told you I know the look
[2:33:18] and I'm gonna say it like this because I
[2:33:20] know I've seen it I've seen it I've seen
[2:33:23] that when somebody passed in the family
[2:33:26] y'all figure y'all got a right to drink
[2:33:31] ease the pain
[2:33:36] what happened to the Holy Ghost like yes
[2:33:40] what happened to the real comforter
[2:33:44] see y'all getting quiet because y'all
[2:33:46] know it's true I don't seen this thing
[2:33:48] more than once y'all think I can't see
[2:33:52] it's wrong
