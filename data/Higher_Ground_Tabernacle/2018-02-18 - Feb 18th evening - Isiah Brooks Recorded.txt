TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a large an Abraham it making me feel old I remember when they were babies now they allowed you entering into that that stage 13 years old Abraham following quickly behind him we think awful it's goodness a man bromas 1 through 2 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God one more scripture Hebrews 10:23 Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised great is his faithfulness that is pray father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for this little group Lord that faithful Corps that no matter what they're here Lord we we're with thankful Lord I know you're mindful because I am Lord and I pray father that you bless this group Lord with a special blessing Lord anoint them with a double portion of your Holy Spirit Lord bring us all into that perfect statue of Christ Lord God that's why we come because we hunger and thirst for your righteousness and you said if we hunger and thirst for your righteousness Lord we shall be filled thank you Jesus for the thirst hallelujah thank you for the hunger hallelujah Lord we give you glory we give you praise we give you honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I hope the speakers are not too loud for you my son was I'm okay as just I want to I was I started preaching on the streets without a microphone so when I have a microphone you know plus the street that loudness I know it kind of we don't want to pierce your ears of make them hurt but it's kind of funny I really appreciate who he was kind of joking a little bit but I took it you know as a word of wisdom we don't we want you to be comfortable we want you to we definitely want you to hear but we don't want you to hear so a man you got to get your ears checked later on so we thank God for His goodness we thank him for his grace amen by God's grace we don't we don't we don't we don't forget finally at some point time we get this sound system fix Amen so the volume and everything will be comfortable for everybody but little by little we thank God for His grace and His mercy I didn't mean it they can feel uncomfortable but I thought I was a blessing from him not to nothing other than that you know we look at ourselves and we understand by God's grace we cannot cleanse ourselves I just wish we could in some ways but I know because in other ways I know God cleanse you it's going to be thorough I might leave a spot I might leave an area that that is not you know I mean taken care of but God sees everything that needs to be done we realized they meant by the grace of God that the blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing that can cleanse us you've heard me say this before I can wash my face I can wash my feet I can wash most of my body even if I got me one of those tools I can even wash my back but only God can wash the heart it is in the place that God sought to place it see if God wanted us to wash out hard he could have taken that hot same heart and put it outside somewhere so it would be easy accessible but God put it in a place where we can't reach it and only the hands of God can go in there and reach that heart and cleanse it and I am so grateful to the Lord that he fixed it that way you know because I realized by the grace of God that we are under the mercies and grace of God I don't believe in you heard me say this many times before God did not call us with the calling to tease us in other words if God said he's gonna do something he's going to do it you know God don't say come to me and as soon as you try to come to him he folds his arms up and run from you know when he says come he means come and the Bible said if any man come unto me I will in no wise cast him out so we have an assurance that if we come to God God will never cast us out amen he will always take care of us he will always keep us it doesn't mean that will not suffer because the Bible said greatest affliction many other fliction of the righteous not the sinners but we know they're going to have affliction but the Bible said many are the afflictions of the righteous is that right many of the trials but God will deliver them from all of them not some but all and many times we fail to see that God's Word is true hallelujah when we see the Scriptures the Bible said in our patience possess our souls waiting on God and waiting for God is two way the Prophet taught us letting go and letting God is the way God prophet taught us and we realize here men that is not always hard easy to let things go it's like a baboon or not calling everybody a baboon or a monkey but one of those things about one of the characteristics of a monkey and of a boon when they see something glitter and shiny and go you know just it fascinates them and you know that's how he used to catch raccoons play something in a position where when the moonlight or the sunlight would hit it more like the moon but they would stick their hand in there and grab it but it would be too big for them to let go and you could walk right up on him and he wouldn't let the thing go because he values it more than his life you know and that's how sometimes we do I mean in the spiritual realm something that glitters something that glows you know it looks really beautiful it's difficult for us especially if our desire is given over to it it's difficult for us to let it go but it's not difficult for God God is the only one that can help us release all of the things that will endanger our souls and we ought to be grateful that God is faithful to that is that right oh it's nothing but the truth I mean you think at look at Samson who's a man of faith I love Samson amen Samson was a man a man whose weakness was women hello and the devil gonna give you whatever your Wheaton whatever he found that weakness is he will send them to you there it is right there you know and Samson was call to the ministry he was called to do a great work for God he whipped the Philistines a minute times but then here came the choice of his life the one woman that fascinated him the most and she was Delilah and the Lila's plan was to destroy Samson her desire was not true love her desire was deceit and in that deceiving him a man he fell in love with her truly fell in love with her and what happened she eventually cut his strength off when she cut his strength off she then then betrayed him by being an informer she him the Philistine soldiers Army soldiers amen where he was and what he was doing and she's also said now I have taken it straight when she took his strength he lost everything even his eyesight but God was faithful hallelujah we find that Samson finds himself in a place and he's crying out to God and says Oh Lord once more how many of you have found yourself in that place more than once more than once have I found myself in that place Oh Lord once more it is okay to be revealed it's okay I'm not back we ought to be refilled every day and you know we see all of these things and you saying well Brotherhood's what are you saying see there's only one man who was perfect and that one man was Jesus Christ himself none of us will ever measure up to that standard and the only way that we could ever come to that standard would be by him you see it was the life in Christ that was perfect that's what the prophets said and so therefore you and I must understand even up to the time of the rapture because of this you would be capable of faltering maga doesn't look at this because this is already judged this is already condemned this part of you will never go to heaven the way it is is that right Amen though this thing of you go down in the grave when it comes back up it will be transformed it will be changed into a glorified body y'all understand me because oftentimes people think that Christians are perfect and we are but our perfection is of Christ and not of ourselves Alleluia I am so grateful Amen that because of that I see how God and this is that this is the hidden mystery I love it you know how you can see the fall of woman's belly the Aerostars our flat and then it started protruding protruding but you never see the image the image is veiled for nine months now big they got machines now but before the machines you could never see what was in there you could never see it whether it was a boy you can see where there was a girl you can see whether the hair was big or small but it was a product that was being produced behind a veil of flesh and just like that lump can not determine you know or you can't determine what gender it is or what it looks like whether it's redhead or black hair and a blue-eyed or whatever the case may be all of that that genetics and everything that goes too long to make a baby is there moving and you know you know doing things that you can't see sometimes the mother may feel it kicking and that kicking is just to you know let you know the baby still alive right sometimes that's what the Holy goes through it it stands still for a while then it'll give you a couple of kicks every now and again just to let you know I'm still there and so you and I but the matter the thing about it is this when when that woman began to have that baby and and envied the process of the birth the water right did the blood right and then that baby comes through that channel and all of a sudden he takes that spirit now you see a glorious image hallelujah hello somebody that glorious image still has to be washed cleaned up prepared so that mom and daddy could hold it but the beauty of that birth is this when the neighbour cord is cut that child now is an individual before the navel cord is cut that child that mother is connected like a church and an individual in a church sometimes there's connection but that when once that birth comes right when you call the churches you justified you get baptized you can sink right but when that birth comes it cuts the cord now it's no load that child is an individual that child amen follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit all right and we look at this you see all brother books I'm gonna tell you we are in the womb of the earth right now we are now being veiled we can't see what that product that's being form them in us will be like we have no idea how it is but surely amen we can see by God's grace that the light that's being formed in us is a new life that's how you know you got the Holy Ghost when you see that a new life is coming the oh you are now is vanishing away right and what does the Holy Ghost come it is to finalize the product it is to burn all of the world out of you it is a burn every evil desire it is a burn is like to like like the earth when it begins when it yells into his new birth is that right future home the private God said the earth will have a fire baptism he said you think that when a true son and daughter of God make a lot a lot of noise when they get it he said you ought to hear the noise when the earth get here and we're looking by the grace of God amen for that birth we looking amen I can't imagine when the product is finished and the Holy Ghost comes and elevates us from this old natural flesh into a glorified body we have no idea what we're looking into a Mayan Hollywood can't even produce a movie that will be able to compare with the reality of these sons and daughters coming to his perfect state hallelujah we'll be able to walk through walls we'll be able to travel like a thought hallelujah you and I will be the very light of the earth hallelujah hey man we'll be more like Paul said more than conquerors we we we we can see the benefits of being new I'm so glad that God didn't decide to make me a dog or cat or cow I really appreciate being a man I love man things I like this position that I have but that wasn't the greatest position that God has given me he's now given you and I positions that are called sons and daughters of God we are kings we are priests hallelujah we are eternal that ought to make every man happy to know that you cannot die that when I close my eyes and my breath and then leaves me it just doesn't vanish into the air but there's a body wake know me just like there's a body weight a spirit waiting on my body there's a body waiting on my spirit oh go to God that ought to make every man excited to know Amen that even though the bomb will drop the Prophet God said before one bomb drop we are gone you don't want to be here when the bomb drop you don't want to get hit be here when the Russian get drunk enough to push the button hallelujah and now we see him and everything that's on the stage we see the stage lead out amen Israel's in a homeland the flag is flying all of the nations hate Israel hey man we see Trump Amen on the scene hallelujah and whether you like it or not Trump is sounding a trumpet his voice is causing Wars spiritual around war natural Rams war political RAM Wars and that's the truth I mean now we're living in a time a men that is talking about the nuclear armory that every country has and who's gonna blow each other up first you see men grow me trying to say who's got the biggest bomb like children but you must understand it is the anointing of the aged and as they feud and fuss Amen God has now put us in a place where he is elevating us amen to look and to act like sons and daughters of God we know that the world will not be destroyed by water anymore hallelujah it's going to get his baptism we know by God's grace God destroyed the water he baptized your earth with water in those day that's why I want people to know God don't sprinkle he submerged you hallelujah because God submerged the earth in water it died and it had a resurrection hallelujah is that the truth every living creature on earth died and then God resurrected it hallelujah the only thing that se was saying was those that were in the ark I love that it meant because one of these old days because we are in the Ark of God and then when the fires fall and burned the whole world up the Bible said we will return like Noah returned on his ark we're returning our hallelujah and the Bible said we'll walk on the ashes of wicked hallelujah I am so grateful that my God has given us a way that we can be changed transformed and translated you see I like the way that sound I'm gonna be honest with you I really like the way that sound because I see the process of God and three is a perfection amen oh my is that right their Bible tells us that don't worry there'll be those who go to sleep before we will air man but guess what they have the privilege of housing first hallelujah the dead in Christ shall rise first and those of us who remain will be quickened and changed and will be caught up to meet him it's a beautiful situation and if the people knew that's why Satan has blinded the mind this is Satan even how how many I believe that do you know Satan is the god of this world every politician is anointed by Satan that's why you can't have a good one everybody up there's from the bad boys it is you you know the day of a righteous man in in politician in the political realm is over never happen again they don't want that kind if they raise up Washington and Abraham Lincoln let the prophet of God and put them all over the world a man will never change the minds of the people by that day is over we are now living in a time where there is a multiplication of the Serpent's huh is that right what Adam was supposed to do he didn't do it but Satan multiply and he has filled his eden with his kind that's why we don't fit that's why we are different that's why amen that we are treated the way we treated because we are not ourselves either we are from another world hallelujah and you and I must understand Amen that we are sojourn as we are pilgrim we are strangers and we're traveling through this world hallelujah oh come on somebody if that you've heard me say if there be any aliens it is to Christians hallelujah because we came from a different dimension hallelujah and we go back to that dimension hallelujah that's why you know we we don't we don't worry you know we're we're not that kind that that's gonna just worry oh I don't have my masters and I don't have my uh a doctrine because let me tell you something once Paul met Jesus he's everything I have gained in this world I'm liking it underdog hallelujah he said I have one purpose now and that is to know Jesus Christ and him crucified hallelujah Paul realized he meant that all this world and everything that it's Oh devil as extreme as being glorious will fade away and the only thing that's gonna ever stand is the Word of God you see that's why God couldn't make us no other way God had to make us a part of him we had to come into this world as part of the word in other words you understand me you had to be born by the word because everything else is going to pass away but the word of the Lord shall stand there's a part of you that will never fade away you saw what do you mean brother Brooks because see you and I was eternal we didn't know it but every one of us somehow even as she was a child you since that that you was different somehow the devil made you know you was different and all that even though when you didn't know God you had a respect for him something like I was telling somebody the other day there was a lady in my neighborhood and evidently she had been a Christian I believe in law but ever times he getting wrong you hear that lady saying and sounded like she was on the heavens quiet and she was always worshiping the Lord even when she was drunk well you say well I lately probably lost I don't believe that because they said when you're drunk that's when you're real you show up see when I was in the world.we program where she drunk you know she lost no that's nonsense if that person have made a promise and they have United with Christ and they have confess along with their heart and their mouth she everybody do that ain't safe because everybody is not God's children but the Bible said I will never lose one hallelujah now we may lose some of the benefits of being a son or daughter but you can never lose your position as being a son and a daughter that's why the prophet of God said there'll be many of there that you thought wasn't gonna make it David said don't let me fall in the hands of man let me fall in the hands of God man don't know how to have mercy don't know how to have grace upon each other but God knows how to do it and to me is amazing grace it's still amazing so you look at these things aware this is what I love about the message it's it assures me folks it makes me know that I am worth something especially to God hallelujah so much so he say I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you right see we don't have to worry about all these things because we realized that Paul said it's nothing except no value it cannot buy me a ticket into heaven it came buy me a seat hallelujah and I'm not concerned about a seat or a chair because mine's already there hallelujah it's just there wait no me is that right that's what the property of God said basically brother man where's your hairs I'd never lose lost one of them are they but they right there where they was before I got him the mothership listen about said the works had been finished before the foundation of the world so what is he saying he is saying that it's already done but we must get out cuz we are in time but in the mind of God is finished you're standing perfect justified before him not tomorrow now and when he says that listen the sons of God how we behold the face of him that's our word body we're now standing in heavenly places beholding the face of God and yet is still we're not even there yet but it's these elements is this world that has veiled us that we can't see in that dimension but I believe before the flood before the fall Adam and Eve could actually see they could hear God and when the angel saying I believe it was a wake-up call hallelujah the angel started began to sing and they won't roll over like all in that heavenly hallelujah because at that time heaven and earth was going is that right hey the ground that I hadn't walk on was holy ground he said how can you say that because there was no sin that same tree of life walked in the cool of the day it was sin that broke brought the breach between heaven and earth but it was just in the same locale pretty much and you said well what do you mean brother bridge that's why people don't understand the probably God said there are dimensions he said television ways and everything right through this place amen and even scientists say they can now they have issuance where they can actually pick up the voice of Jesus so you know we are looking at a place where it never dies and the only thing that would stop the echo the only thing that was stopping is the blood of Jesus you understand me so will you say Lord I want to be translated the Bible said he not walk with God and he was found not hallelujah and we think Oh some astronaut came down and took him some alien from another planet I don't know people thinking about but because they can't figure out they've draw up these crazy things in their mind hallelujah but the world was created by God the dinosaurs were created by God however they look I don't care why do I have to care about what the dinosaurs look like like I said the other day wherever I was I was preaching not really article and was tough these people these black people and I forgot exactly where they were I think some from Australia Aborigines and summer for other places their dark black with kinky hair some with blue eyes some with green eyes and just this strange looking for beautiful people beautiful people and they said somewhere down the line because these people have a different bloodline I'm like what are you talking about you know what they said that somehow man came and greed with the Neanderthal God can make a flower any color he wants to I [Music] remember when I saw a black man black it's me darker than me far dark black like Indian he may have been with baby blue eyes I was a boy guess what I did I stared just like y'all would have cuz it was my first time ever seeing that before you know what I'm saying and you and I look at these things use and what brother why are you saying these things I'm saying to you brother branham said it like this he said everything saying took from you God is gonna give it back so whatever is in your physical makeup in a deformed way because y'all don't know I don't care about how beautiful y'all think you are you are deformed you gonna have a better look than what you got now hallelujah you look just like you but better somebody say can I look better but yes yes they're gonna be a better you think about a people God didn't purpose somebody in one to be bigger than the other Satan did that kind of stuff you know and you know God is going to fix it I've seen and if what I seen by way of dream is his reality there is no way to describe you because the faces that I've seen geometrically was perfect perfect and you know I look at these things I say wow you know but the beautiful thing about it is it really won't matter how you look because everybody gonna love you there anyhow ain't nobody gonna be looking in the mirror said oh brother rich I'm looking pretty good today it ain't gonna be that let me move on folks I'm getting it off a little bit listen the word translated means to change the form condition nature hallelujah and that's what God is doing now spirit translated means to change the form condition or nature and God is doing what changing our nature there's Adamic nature into the nature of God hallelujah hey little by little right it took nine monster to grow you in the womb there's a time amen when you first was conceived you like a little tadpole or some kind of little fishy thing then from there Amen if you look in that you know you see the stages are like a little dragon or something right I say fishy thing because really it looks like a serpent of course with a cobra head but by God's grace he changed us hallelujah and the devil gives us the Serpent's flesh y'all notice the Serpent's flesh huh because the sinful flesh that's why you have so much trouble with this flesh that's why this flesh cannot be tamed you must kill him Paul said I die daily so you and I must understand let me move on we want the change we want the transformation we want to be converted we really want all the deeds of the flesh to be dead and only the holy ghost can do it only the Holy Ghost I don't care amen i'ma tell you something the Bible says wherever there's law seeing about you see these people Amen over in these foreign countries with everything covered you know and I think to myself I said here I've seen women covered all up here and all except their eye oh my god this should cover the eyes is that right because there is the Gateway you can't lust after something you don't you don't see and to be honest with you all that clothes don't stop people from imaginations you understand me and one of my son says yeah you see him walking like that it says a spooky thing the one who's been out overseas he said but then when you go to their house they got all the Western clothes those one those same Muslim take off all that stuff put on their hind your shoes and they short dresses why because their husbands they call them Devils but they want to drive they want to make them dress like a devil in the house and look like a saint outside we must be sanctified you can't even get the Holy Ghost without it that's the stage that's how God takes it justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost but your sanctification is not you it's not what you call sanctified hello you ever seen sanctified dirt hallelujah but you know what God said to Moses take off your shoes I love the head but the ground that you stand out is holy ground dirt that God made holy that's all I'm saying I'm dirt but God made this dirt holy wherever God is it becomes holy a holy Lord I wish you can see it the way I see he-hey but God is the one that sanctified it look what Jesus did his blood dropped on the earth and the earth became sanctified so you say well what do you mean brother ones because of the blood of Jesus my body that caves from the earth amen must claim in sanctification by and through the blood of Jesus that's how we get sanctified by faith I'm sanctified when I claim that faith and when I claim that sanctify sanctification Amen being God began to cleanse me make me sanctified because I confess sanctification somebody help me here you and I like I said what about h2o it cannot change h2o one part hard hydrogen to power oxygen guess what it equals whoa and let me tell you now if you use hu all every time put those two chemicals together it will never vary it will never change because that's the law of science it will always come up to be water that's how the world of God is you put faith and a mountain together every time faith is applied to the mountain the mountain must move that's an equation you say yes it is because Jesus said if you say to this mountain be thou moved the mountain must move it's an equation took by Pontius if faith will move a mountain and remove everything else put faith plus whatever it has to equal victory that's the equation it cannot change by faith Abraham moved look at the scripture accordingly Hebrews 11 everything was done by faith because we who are believers we have a faith civilization we have a ram that we live and operate in that the world cannot see they laugh at us right Jesus said get out of the house the dog the dog the dancers sleep they laugh to the death well because in there Ram was dead in Jesus Ram she's asleep he said Tabitha come for guess what Kepler didn't have the faith to call her he had to faith but she died in faith so faith connect with faith and they got up you and I must understand Amen whenever God tells you to do something it's going to be done right brother man said when I saw those visions when God showed me something he said I'd never worried about it he said because everything he ever showed me came to pass hallelujah if God by inspiration tells you something I don't care if the whole world don't see it can't see it you need to have faith and said how do you know it's going to happen like Noah said God said stone hallelujah I look at all of my older and I always say y'all hear me say I say sometimes he look like sometimes they get him an impossible places the answer but I remember the day when I was on my knees in church I didn't ask God God came to me and he told me he was gonna save every one of my children hallelujah how can I doubt him as that song said when I know too much about it I don't care what it looks like I don't know how he's gonna do it but he told me so and I owe fast to him y'all hear me and I look at that thing and I said hey look at Oh joke knew his children without their partying can old amen job didn't worry he said I'm going to do what God told me to do i'ma lay that blood on the altar hallelujah I'm gonna pray for them because I know the prayer of a righteous man availeth much hallelujah whatever God's told me to do I'm gonna do it because the equation must come out the same hallelujah that's why the promise said if there be somebody with the same kind of condition meaning the same kind of faith God has to do the same thing always always hallelujah but without faith it's impossible to please him but he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently kill you got to believe and you got to know that God is God hallelujah God is God he's not a second God he's not a third God He is God y'all know who God is God is the creator of all things he's omnipotent he's our mission PC / dyra he's your home Arafah hallelujah he's your holy SH alone he's all these things there is no other name given a minute among men whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus and that's the name of Jesus Christ every knee shall bow he's the only potentate he's the only authority Satan has no authority Satan has no power what he did have was taken from him now the squatter has been exposed hallelujah if somebody is on your land he's a squatter right now you can kick him off your land because you realize Amen the title deed was in your name all along hallelujah Amen that's how God has given the times right but you've got to be changed you got to get to a place where your thoughts are spiritual like I was telling the people the other day you got to stop and I say that all the time even for me sometimes we think like men sometimes we think like children when we ought to be thinking like I let this mind be in you how do I think like God first of all you think like and when you acknowledge him when you acknowledge him then he'll tell you the direction to go in and when he tells you the direction to go in then you thinking like him don't you say Lord not my will but thine be done hallelujah listen what James said James says for as the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also oh I got faith and there are no works there's no evidence that faith does that work he said don't be dead don't do that don't do that it's like a body without that's what I'm saying when I come up a hit and there is no spirit that if he's dead we need Holy Ghost in here we need God in here and then we need the spirit because without him here we're dead I don't care what you think we're there and you know when something is dead you can't get him to move the only thing a dead body can do is blow up at you oh my god but when the spirit of life is in there oh it moves it jabs he shouts hallelujah I looked at little story the Prophet God told and he's told tells that story about how that skinny calf and the fat calf a man was out there in the yard and in that little ah us giddy calf looked at the fat calf because he was bucking and kicking everything he did but natus ISM but let the people call you phonetic when you got the joy of the Lord in here I don't care this with one person jumping and shouting and praising I know that ain't all it but when you know that you've got the victory and we must know we have the victory oh we lose some battles people we fight and we fight and sometimes we fall but the justice that just to get up seven times in a day we go through those changes that time but I'm talking about the end of your faith you got the victory and that's what the Bible said we ought to receive the end of our faith forget about this in between is that the year that's why I said when God in this last day he didn't start from the beginning he started right at the end at the opening of the seals he started to tell us exactly what's going to happen what happened and he tells us all the victories throughout the church ages you know he tells us amen how they got the victory he tells us how he always stood in the midst of the golden calendar sticks and then brother Brandon said it wasn't a he was a she huh that means the bride got victory in every church age by what the power of her husband ha and the devil is upset he don't want us to come to maturity because once we come into a full maturity he knows his finish because the Bible said your next move is a thousand years of bondage and after that thousand years of bondage devil you thrown into the lake of fire to my boobs and while he's in his chains we're walking upon the earth and we're judging the nations and we're ruling with the rod of iron hallelujah not even a crack of sin would be able to escape us oh come on somebody ah ain't God good to us I'm trying to finish up like I said God bring his children to the impossible to face the impossible to change the impossible to the possible then then to them ought to all those things he make it happens we are the last days and we are come to a place where this is an impossible age it's impossible to live holy is impossible to live sanctified it's impossible to have a peace of mind every think it's impossible everything that God demands of us is impossible but God made provision for us to have the possible is that right and that's when Jesus said all things are possible turn them that believe hallelujah and we are those who believe we know by God's grace a man it shall always come to pass but as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make sure remain before me say at the Lord so shall your seed and your name remain let's say it again for as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me saith the Lord so shall your seed and your name remain your seed and your name remain it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the Lord he ain't God good what do we now am our clothes in just a minute we are now coming we are now what did the seals do for you ooh first of all brother Adam said it was a sound of the Jubilee God said I don't care what slave market you've been in and what kind of change ohyeah your true sons and daughters of God you are free but in that freedom what the God say it's up to you I have blown the trumpet I have sounded it now you can go free and what did God do he left that freedom up to the slave right he can either go free or he can remain with this that is the slave master hallelujah but the Bible tells us that if he remained with the slave master then they would do what for his ear with an awl and that would be a sign that he could never go free again hmm that means that he'll never be able to hear the gospel again he can hear it but he wouldn't be able to receive and he won't be able to take it into his heart because once you refuse your freedom Satan has a right hello and I know some of y'all know your history even when slaves were free all slaves did not leave their masters why because some of the slaves if they had good masters their masters took care of them all of them were mean and vicious you understand me then there were those Amen who didn't see how they could make it because they couldn't read they couldn't write I'm gonna make it out there on my own at least at the Masters house I'm being fair you know they had these reasonings wouldn't get themself a chance they wouldn't venture out into the new world you understand me and this is not picking on anybody I'm just saying I'm working this thing only just to bring a spiritual application all of that was done so that we can see that you have a right to go free I don't care what your bondage is you can go free God is right there to make you free the Spirit of the Lord is freedom he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed so we must understand we come to claim my inheritance hallelujah I love it Jesus went into the field and they start eating corn and everything in somebody else's field hallelujah but Jesus leave that's mine you better believe it led by the spirit on that one now you know to say but my point is he was a lord of all things and he knew it was here and they had a law that you can go into that field and eat but just just just don't take a bag with you to carry nothing out so he was right in the heel of the Lord hey man you know that that used to be a law that if you was in the or you can eat it in there but if you take it out you caught stealing there been times I've seen a lot of empty wrappers in stores because there was a time if you Lowe's you there eating it they couldn't but once you took that bag out that's stealing I know it's not like that now it used to be like this in South Carolina if he was caught speeding on a Sunday and you was going to church they could not issue you a ticket that's how South Carolina used to honor the word don't try it now because almost all the blue laws are done away with right and y'all remember I noticed brother stamps I know y'all remember when when when stores would close early on Saturdays I remember down south I'm from the southern belle six o'clock on Saturday evenings all stores except the medication store like drugstores they stayed open there was no more selling booze or liquor after 6:00 everything that's the way this country used to fear God but they did away with the blue law you couldn't even have a club open on a Sunday but they are seven days a week see what I'm saying but they used to fear God but no longer let me move on we are come where we come to a time that you and I must understand that Abraham a lot we look at the situation I see our inheritance lot was Abraham's inheritance and though lot went wrong Abraham loved him and though lot went wrong Abraham fought for him right and you and I must understand we must fight but how do we fight you fight on your knees hallelujah I remember my old mama I remember my wife I can understand why she was on her knees she was crying out for me look where her prayers have brought me you may not see your prayers answered in death time but in the next to come it'll be your prayer that got your loved ones through when you think they're not paying you attention they know you're right but oftentimes they got demons binding them at the end of the day brother I don't say many of them are make it through because of your testimony oh fast your testimony keep praying foam doesn't matter how how they treat you you got to love your enemies anyway hallelujah the truth of the matter is whatever you do you give up on nobody you never give up because God don't give up on us do you labor yes you labor but understand we are to the faith civilization I keep saying it you are civilization of faith a man you are people who faith who operates by faith we call those things that gaybraham did though as though they as there they were even though they be not we look at the unseen it says I know my god is able hallelujah you understand me scientific civilization we we have he said exactly Satan's trap he said all the scientific stuff our traps developed by Satan to do what entrap you we spend more time on the only these computers and these little gadgets amen more time than with them that on our knees it's a trap it's a trap is something to distract you I'm not saying something wrong but you must understand every development in this world the scientific world is good and evil that was the tree they ate off that's the tree we in this world y'all won't you all right with that listen the coming judgement so we can understand this world this world is it will be judged and and you and I must it is judged we know that it's been found in the balance has been had been weighed in the balance found launched in 1960 v 56 50 70 men when America had an opportunity to repent they wouldn't and now by God's grace you see what has happened to America nobody would have if those people in that day would not have I have dreamed of what this day would look like and in that great day that we're living in a great civilization fixing to be blasted from the earth hmm you say well as it was in the days of Noah so will it be only this time instead of water it'll be fire the world will rock by atomic power you know what listen and what it is you see these countries now saying oh but we can shut down American greed you know what I believe that they've develop equipment right that they can shut it down and if they shut us down what is our defense because everything is electronic I don't care how many bombs you got if you don't have no power to send it off you're done and I look at things that said I don't know how it's going to turn I do know Russia will send a bomb here and to the Vatican I'm I thought about this I said you know these people up there or I'll bomb you and I'll bomb you and I'll bomb you and I think this is what I'm thinking somebody willing to bomb somebody and then rush you're gonna get upsetting on a bomber but I won't be here I just hope y'all in the heart all right because amen I'm planning to be translated right the BART the world will rock by atomic power all God made men and women everywhere realize the seriousness of this visitation of God that's what I'm saying and that's where I say it this morning if we could really realize the visitation of Malachi for revelation 10 7 if we could see the Prophet why God had to sin it because before every destruction God sins a problem and what's so wonderful about us here we are Gentiles and when the prophet of God came on the earth he was the first Gentile prophet that we knew of Balaam may have been one but my point is this he didn't come to in the world and the Bible said amen in Malachi 4 amen three four now we realize him n that this this this prophet that God was the sin in this day was coming just before the fire hmm and he tells us at the time about his event there at Yellowstone and how that glacier came up and the fire went everywhere and he said oh let the fire fall and nobody catches me but a word of a prophet came out word of his out of his mouth let the fire fall do you think he was just saying it it's a parable the bride catches it the word of the Lord comes through the mouth of a prophet and it cannot come back boy he said California was going to say it's gonna say Mexico just look at the look at the earthquakes now they're closer now that California and they ever been I was listening to hit escape here that quickly come come up hither you know what he said he said even the scientists did not pick up the earthquake that was to hit India but the animal did could it be I'm not saying it is that this earth take quake that's going hit California because they got all of their machine will be one that they won't be able to pick up do you really think the newscasters in Noah's day picked up the storm that was three they had no idea everybody watching over this one this one and that little boy in that dream in 1933 I think it was say it started off so saw so like that people was making fun of that little shaking began to rock everything see what people don't understand once everything is set up and all of the big ones done came all the tickets just a little noise what do you think I'm closing every moment almost with you coming from Colossians first chapter but let me say this God has sent his angel of mercy is up to but this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that G might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joy Paul yeah y'all think God right in this world out here for us not to pay attention to it you see at some point we must begin to literally see what Satan is doing and enjoy I have a joy about it I wasn't there with Peter but I'm sure there was a certain amount of joy Peter had knowing this was just in that his work on earth is spinning oh you say Oh Paul Paul was go Lord no no no I really believe the joy Paul had a joy when he was going to Nero's choppers Bob but you know what Paul could have gotten out of it but Paul pushed the issue I want to see Caesar there was a certain amount of joy that he had Oh was he jumping out but I know there was a joy in his heart to know like bother Bosworth that's what I'm here for I worked all these years preaching this gospel and just in a moment's time I'm gonna see the one that I've been preaching about that's what all I'm saying straighten with all might according to his glorious power that's where our strength comes from is that word Jesus went to the cross and the bow said because of the joy that was set before him he might have whooped him but they couldn't take over his joy they might have beat him and he might have made him feel like nothing but inside or the inside you know all brother was you said but he was God don't say God pulled himself away from him he went the Calvary as a main he didn't go as a God he went as a man that's why he said on that cross father why hast thou forsaken can you imagine never being without the Holy Spirit anointing him in that certain way amen since the time he was filled at the baptism of John now this God who he heard and felt and everything else was now moved anybody ever felt that way oh yeah I've had the Holy Spirit pull away from me at times and that's not a good feeling God will do it like the prophet of God said when he said to the Lord Lord you owe me an explanation brother well said he kept quiet but what a month or so however long it was he said but when God saw that I was done with my pouting he came back and he told me why there's always good answers in this thing oh lord have mercy give thanks to the father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son delivered us from the power of the huh so that means I don't care how strong and how powerful this darkness over you a menos agents putting it on you but you are delivered already deliver but you must accept your deliverance in order to be delivered is that right you were saved for the violation of law but you had to accept your salvation hallelujah not the Holy Ghost you were sealed before the foundation and all but you got to accept your sealing by faith you have accept everything by faith in order to please God by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God that's how we when God translate us we would have a testimony that we pleased if Enoch had to have a testimony that he pleased God you must have a testimony because God is not going to give you a grade curve y'all love the Lord you love the Lord let's stand have faith in God please people it is faith that pleases God right without faith is impossible please is there any man who have done great works on the earth that have never failed only one man that was Jesus Christ Moses failed in Joseph failed him so what Joseph was perfect with limit Joseph told a lie Joseph told that Pharaoh that his parents name were count on with hurdles and not cheap early oh that's a little one it still wine mmm what about all the others amen everybody the Bible says all have sinned oh yes I loved a because david knew how to repair he did a lot around family knew i was in law give me and that's what I say the Lord I said not I don't want to be sorry I want real repentance anybody can be sorry for what they've done wrong I don't want to feel sorry I won't genuine repentance that when it comes I can rest assure and I get my victory I won't go back and do it again in times like these we need a Savior in times like me we need an anchor be very to be very sure you're a co and grips the solid in times like you we need a
