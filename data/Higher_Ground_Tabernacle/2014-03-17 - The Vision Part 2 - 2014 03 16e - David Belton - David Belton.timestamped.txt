[0:52] but to walk in the spirit is to walk in
[0:54] the anointed word for your day amen
[0:57] that's walking in the spirit many looks
[1:00] look spiritual you know but when you're
[1:04] walking in the anointed word for the
[1:07] hour Proverbs
[1:10] 29 18 where there is no vision the
[1:14] people perish but he that keepeth the
[1:17] law happy is he see it's a blessing
[1:20] you're happy to keep the law and the law
[1:22] of God is the word of God you can be
[1:25] seated may the Lord have a blessing to
[1:26] the reading of his words as the prophet
[1:29] taught us the law is the word of God In
[1:32] seed
[1:34] for but when it takes on flesh he said
[1:37] is the grace of God and as we talked
[1:40] about this morning Israel chose law over
[1:43] Grace the worst
[1:46] mistake as we pointed out the law
[1:48] pointed out our
[1:50] sins but Grace said I forgive you Grace

[2:13] the prophet taught us he said now notice
[2:15] the the lamb when the lamb took the book

[2:20] Redemption is near but then he when the
[2:23] lamb takes the book Redemption is here

[2:30] is here the day of our Redemption is
[2:33] here because the lamb has took taken the
[2:35] book and tore off the seals amen so we

[2:46] declare that Christ is here amen praise

[2:54] most happiest Bunch on the face of the

[3:05] conscious of his presence he preached
[3:07] the unrecognized presence of God or the
[3:10] presence of God unrecognized why because
[3:12] many did not recognize his presence and
[3:16] many think he went off the scene when
[3:18] brother Brena went off the scene no the
[3:20] presence of the Lord is here Heen see I
[3:23] don't want just an anointing upon my
[3:25] flesh an anointing upon my spirit but I

[9:10] dimmed
[9:11] over go ask him is he the one is he the
[9:15] Messiah is he the one or do we look for
[9:18] another because first they asked John
[9:20] John are you the Christ he said no are
[9:22] you that Prophet what prophet
[9:24] Deuteronomy 18:15 no are you Eli then
[9:27] the one before the draft of day no well
[9:29] who are you John I'm the voice of one
[9:31] Christ in the wilderness as said the
[9:33] prophet Isaiah John gave them a
[9:35] scripture identification of himself and
[9:38] you as a son and daughter of God ought
[9:41] to give the anybody who ask a scripture
[9:45] identification of why you believe what
[9:47] you
[9:48] believe a lot of people go to a sinner
[9:51] and say you know brother brandham said
[9:52] this the prophet said that they don't
[9:54] even know Christ you know what I'm
[9:56] saying Jesus didn't right away told them
[9:59] about Elijah you know that he taught
[10:02] them in the scripture and as we tell
[10:04] them enough as they see that Jesus
[10:07] Christ the same yesterday and forever
[10:09] they'll ask you well what's the prophet
[10:11] for this day you know if you rightly
[10:13] tell them and show them Christ in the
[10:15] word they G to ask you who is Elijah or
[10:18] where is Elijah cuz they going to catch
[10:20] the pattern of God and as we show them
[10:22] the pattern of God and how God works and
[10:25] how he thinks and how he never changes
[10:28] then they'll see see it hey man bless
[10:31] His holy name it's the truth you know
[10:34] later on in in the ministry Jesus said
[10:36] now and they said Lord didn't scribe
[10:37] said that Elijah should first come and
[10:39] restore remember they asked him and then
[10:42] he begin to show them yes praise the
[10:45] Lord he's the same he never changes he
[10:47] never breaks his
[10:49] word amen so amen I want to read
[10:55] something it's it's Amplified and I I
[10:58] love this cuz it's it brings some Hebrew
[11:00] words Hebrew interpretations and it it
[11:03] blesses my
[11:06] soul Isaiah 60 it says
[11:10] arise
[11:12] from the
[11:14] depression this Isaiah 60 verse1 arise
[11:18] from depression and
[11:20] prostration in which
[11:23] circumstances have kept you rise to a
[11:27] New Life shine be radiant with glory of
[11:32] the Lord for your light has come and the
[11:35] glory of the Lord has risen upon you and
[11:39] a prophet taught us in Christ revealed
[11:41] in his own word he said now remember
[11:43] Satan have one punch
[11:47] coming God has given him that right but
[11:52] see we don't have to let him keep
[11:53] punching on us it's time to rise up amen
[11:57] we had to fight him sooner or later
[11:59] and the time is right now amen praise
[12:03] the Living God to cast the revelation of
[12:06] the word and the revelation of the blood
[12:09] and driveing Into the Heart of the enemy
[12:11] not on one another because we know elect
[12:14] does not persecute El La you as we
[12:16] search the
[12:18] scripture and the Bible tells us be
[12:20] ready to give an answer to the hope that
[12:22] lies within you steadly show their S
[12:25] approv A Workman need not be ashamed
[12:27] rightly devid in the word of Truth amen
[12:29] 1 Peter 3:15 2 Timothy 2:15 it tells us
[12:33] that so
[12:35] now elect does not persecute elac and if
[12:39] you find as we see the
[12:42] Scriptures it was always the non-elect
[12:46] that was doing the
[12:47] persecution always it was always the
[12:50] non-elect trying to labor everybody
[12:53] trying to say who's who and who's not
[12:55] trying to say who's bride and who's not
[12:57] bride
[12:59] that's not our place that's not our
[13:02] business praise the Lord but long we are
[13:06] called to recognize who we are and who
[13:08] he is amen that's what matters to
[13:12] me praise the Living
[13:14] God for behold Darkness shall cover the
[13:17] Earth and den Darkness All Peoples but
[13:21] the Lord shall rise upon you and His
[13:24] glory shall be seen on
[13:27] you amen
[13:30] praise the Lord don't you want his glory
[13:31] to be seen upon you I want his glory to
[13:34] be seen upon me so Redemption comes in
[13:37] two parts out of and
[13:40] into praise the Lord see as we said many

[15:29] of his own self but what he seeth the
[15:32] father do that doeth the son likewise
[15:35] the Lord Jesus moved by
[15:38] Vision
[15:40] amen and God he uses dreams at times he
[15:43] showed Joseph in a
[15:45] dream to go another
[15:48] way God we know dreams are
[15:51] secondarily but God also he comes by
[15:55] inspiration he said when you come to
[15:58] these uh great trials and and and you're
[16:01] brought before counsels don't even don't
[16:03] even premeditate don't even think what

[16:11] walking in the law of God which is the
[16:13] word of God the anointed word of this
[16:15] hour then God will bring it back to your

[16:26] comes from the almighty it's the breath
[16:28] of of God

[16:34] symbols by Parables and also through a
[16:38] prophet Amen in
[16:41] songs in
[16:43] music in poets and poems all that is the
[16:46] ministry of Christ amen signs wonders
[16:48] Miracles the nine spiritual gifts God
[16:51] operates in many ways but we know his
[16:53] first
[16:55] way is by his word because the word of
[16:58] the Lord is the voice of
[17:01] God so we're so thankful as many ways
[17:04] God makes himself
[17:06] known many ways so we're thankful for
[17:08] that we know he have before the written
[17:11] word was the unwritten word the Loos
[17:14] amen aren't you glad but then he he
[17:17] wanted to put it in the Zodiac God's
[17:20] first Bible written in the Zodiac his

[17:46] send you the hope of glory amen that's
[17:50] what the devil hates but that's the
[17:52] whole purpose that's the essence as we
[17:54] said this morning the token that's the
[17:57] essence
[17:59] amen of what God want wanted to
[18:02] do because he Elohim existed alone but
[18:07] he wanted a family I'm glad to be a part
[18:10] of his family aren't you glad oh God oh
[18:15] God and then how the prophet taught us
[18:18] he saw God in nature aren't you glad
[18:21] even in
[18:22] nature we could see God God described
[18:25] himself as as a dove the spirit of God
[18:28] like a
[18:29] you know he described himself as a lamb
[18:32] you know God one thing about him you
[18:34] know he boasting himself if anybody have
[18:36] a right to boast God have a right to
[18:41] boast he swore by himself to Abraham you
[18:44] know we could swear about something
[18:47] greater growing up we used to swear
[18:49] about our Granddaddy and
[18:52] grandmother but but he swore by himself
[18:56] can you imagine that a man say swear by
[18:59] myself they couldn't do it but he could
[19:01] do it so he swore by himself that he'll
[19:04] bless us cuz he could find no one
[19:06] greater amen I love that so he swore by
[19:09] himself to Abraham that I'mma bless you
[19:11] and your seed after you and one thing
[19:14] about Abraham seed the prophet said
[19:16] Abraham seats believe the words the word
[19:20] of God
[19:24] quickly and walks in it
[19:30] just like David he repented quick see it
[19:33] have to be that way someone going on 10
[19:36] years down the road and still don't know
[19:39] whether he was a true Prophet or not
[19:40] something is wrong some said we don't
[19:43] have a cloud Ministry but I believe that
[19:46] cloud I believe
[19:51] that it was super natural just as sure
[19:54] as the veil was rent from top to bottom
[19:56] that cloud is true
[19:59] regardless how much the devil put
[20:00] scarecrows there but it's the word of
[20:03] God and as Ezekiel said whether they
[20:06] hear or whether they forbear yet they
[20:08] will know that a prophet is been among
[20:10] them amen just as sure it was the days
[20:13] of Noah and the days of lot so shall it
[20:16] be in his en time the son of man is
[20:19] being revealed and I'm glad for his
[20:23] grace one thing about God when he sent
[20:27] Moses you know
[20:29] when he sent
[20:30] [Music]
[20:32] Moses then
[20:34] [Music]
[20:36] Moses um there he he was giving those
[20:39] signs and as he was giving those
[20:43] signs he threw his serpent this broad it
[20:47] was thrown down rather turned to a
[20:50] serpent Pharaoh call his musicians they
[20:53] threw down ass turn the serpent even
[20:56] though Moses serpent ate up
[21:01] their I believe it was showing that
[21:03] death was going to be swallowed up amen
[21:06] Jesus conquered death hell in the grave
[21:08] but not only
[21:11] that when he
[21:14] called
[21:21] FRS when he threw up the dust he called
[21:26] for life he went to
[21:29] Pharaoh can't
[21:31] do see the devil can impersonate every
[21:34] gift but he cannot create he man aren't
[21:38] you glad oh God see God God knew what he
[21:41] was going to do all along see the devil
[21:43] thought he had an edge but God was only
[21:46] only just just uh lured him amen into a
[21:50] trap and the devil know he can't create
[21:53] but he can impersonate every gift the
[21:56] prophet said Satan hand out the gifts by
[21:58] the hand fs and he'll say if I could
[22:00] just get them off the word then he got
[22:03] them but as long as we stay fortified
[22:05] behind the
[22:07] word we cannot be deceived we are the
[22:11] word we cannot be
[22:13] deceived you should know them by their
[22:16] fruits their
[22:18] teaching praise the Lord bless his
[22:21] wonderful name so the enemy can't create
[22:29] the word can't can't add to the word
[22:31] can't misinterpret the word can't
[22:33] misapply can't mislocate the word amen
[22:36] the third pool cannot be
[22:39] impersonated remember the first two the
[22:41] enemy impersonate but you can't
[22:43] impersonate the third
[22:46] pool can't impersonate the true love of
[22:49] God even an animal or a baby they could
[22:52] pick up the spirit of Love they could
[22:54] pick it up and also an animal could pick
[22:57] up the spirit of fear
[23:01] so impersonate it can't impersonate and
[23:04] not holy of holies to impersonate that
[23:07] is death we know back in the Garden of
[23:10] Eden that way after man
[23:13] failed God placed those cherums there
[23:16] with flaming swords to guard the way to
[23:19] the tree of
[23:21] life because God cannot break his word
[23:24] he said the day you eat thereof the tree
[23:26] of knowledge the day you die so God had
[23:29] to place those shums there to God the
[23:33] way cuz Adam would eventually I'm
[23:37] dropping this in I believe Adam would
[23:40] eventually ate himself into an immortal
[23:45] body Adam could have say tree be plucked
[23:48] up in place over
[23:50] here and they were in perfect Fellowship
[23:54] they met every evening and had church
[23:57] amen my
[23:59] and some can't go three days a week with
[24:01] church M but they met every evening and
[24:04] the pillow fire met them there and they
[24:06] had fellowship with almighty God even
[24:10] the animals you
[24:12] know praise the Living
[24:16] God it's something about perfect
[24:19] love I had a dream years ago about 20
[24:22] years ago
[24:23] 1994 and the Lord was showing me in the
[24:27] dream there were these Prehistoric
[24:29] Beasts I was in a forest and these
[24:32] Prehistoric Beasts were coming after me
[24:35] to rip me
[24:36] apart and there were
[24:39] people looking
[24:41] inside rejoicing to see my hurt to see
[24:45] me ripped
[24:46] apart and a voice begin to speak to me
[24:49] and say don't fear I climbed up in a
[24:52] tree try to protect myself but the
[24:55] creatures were so big they could reach
[24:57] in the tree the for said come down out
[24:59] of the
[25:00] tree and then when I came down out of
[25:02] the tree they were constantly coming
[25:04] after me to rip me
[25:06] apart and and those people I didn't see
[25:08] any faces I'm glad I
[25:10] did but rejoicing to see my hurt but
[25:14] then all of a sudden the voice said I've
[25:17] given you supreme power and control over
[25:21] every creeping thing in beast of the
[25:23] Earth according to Genesis
[25:26] to and all of a sudden the spirit of
[25:29] perfect love Came Upon me the anointing
[25:31] of perfect Love It Came Upon me in the
[25:33] dream and all those animals that was
[25:36] coming to rip me apart they stopped in
[25:38] their tracks and went their ways and I
[25:41] woke up crying because I believe I had
[25:43] experience that rim of perfect love that
[25:46] and the Prophet come told us whatever
[25:48] you do get perfect love no one can enter
[25:51] him without it love is the greatest
[25:54] force on this Earth love called amen
[25:58] love told the Hornets to go back to
[26:00] their nest perfect love stopped the
[26:03] killer bu in his tracks amen perfect
[26:06] love was spoken

[26:12] the name of Jesus Christ
[26:14] amen amen perfect love said before the
[26:19] doctors touch her let the tumor be gone
[26:23] maybe some would have said that's
[26:24] judgment on you for talking to me the
[26:26] wrong way you know maybe some men told
[26:29] their wife that but here perfect love
[26:31] said before the doctors touch her let
[26:34] the tumor be gone perfect love said told
[26:36] that couple I forgive you perfect love
[26:40] told the maniac when he HK spit in his
[26:43] face he said I love him you see what
[26:46] perfect love does but because you've
[26:48] challenged the Son of God you'll fall to
[26:50] my feet why because the word of God the
[26:53] scripture cannot be broken he said I
[26:55] will cause your enemies to fall at you
[26:58] your feet hey man aren't you
[27:01] glad he said I've given you all power
[27:03] over the enemy so whatever you do get
[27:06] perfect love now this is the real to

[32:36] him no matter you might speak with
[32:39] tongues you might impersonate any gift
[32:41] that God's Got You might do that but
[32:44] until these virtues here go into you
[32:47] you'll still off the real true
[32:50] foundation but when these virtues grow
[32:53] in as you added on to that then you are
[32:57] a living Monument you a living moving
[33:02] Idol praise the Living God that's why
[33:05] the prophet said we should ask God for
[33:08] word on top of word on top of
[33:11] word why because we gonna need it we
[33:14] needed to defeat the
[33:17] enemy he's going like a roaring line
[33:20] he's not a roaring line but he's going
[33:22] like a ro line but remember when the
[33:24] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[33:26] of God lifts up a standard against the
[33:29] enemy every time he
[33:31] came he came on his white
[33:35] horse that that Lon anointing came he
[33:38] came on his red horse amen that Ox
[33:41] anointing came he came on his black
[33:44] horse amen that wisdom of the man came
[33:47] and now he's beginning just about begin
[33:51] to ride on his Pale Horse where that
[33:53] eager anointing is here to combat every
[33:56] demon from hell and we know the lead has
[33:59] already been torn off of hell and those
[34:01] demons have been
[34:03] loosed Revelation 9 and 13 through 16
[34:07] the river Euphrates they they come to go
[34:09] against not against denominations but

[34:17] those Eagles Wings
[34:19] amen and he'll combat every demon that
[34:22] comes up against
[34:25] us praise the Living God
[34:29] as we know the word of God you know what
[34:32] say
[34:34] it in the time of peace I don't know who
[34:38] said that phrase way back I try to
[34:40] search
[34:41] it say in the time of peace prepare for
[34:46] war Always Be Ready for War and the
[34:49] greatest battle of fought is right here
[34:51] see God chose to meet the enemy in no
[34:54] man's land not to meet the enemy in your
[34:57] heart
[34:59] not to meet the enemy in your flesh but
[35:02] he chose to meet the enemy in the no
[35:04] man's land in the battleground of your
[35:06] mind and that's the greatest battle I
[35:08] ever fought is right in the human
[35:14] mind but we have
[35:22] Victory even the Lord Jesus he had to be
[35:25] partakers because he was the he is the
[35:28] husband so he he had to be partakers of
[35:31] the first
[35:32] fruits and the Bible tells us Amen in
[35:35] Hebrews 5 he was
[35:38] tempted All
[35:41] Points like on
[35:44] us yet without sin you said what's all
[35:48] Point lust at I lust of the flesh the
[35:52] pride of life those are the points after
[35:55] that the government come out
[35:58] amen it's the
[36:06] truth so it's Faith the Lord Jesus lived
[36:10] in a world of perfect faith and perfect
[36:13] Faith Faith Works by love I'm so
[36:17] glad so we got to possess those things
[36:20] in
[36:22] Christ as we talked about this morning
[36:24] there's only one thing the devil is
[36:26] afraid of that
[36:28] blood that word and Faith holds to
[36:32] it it's strong see faith is strong it
[36:36] takes a strong hand of
[36:39] faith and we marching on in the Lord we
[36:42] can't look back frog look back but those
[36:46] four living creatures they kept moving
[36:47] forward and we're moving forward
[36:50] amen cuz one time those full living
[36:53] creatures were blocking us away to enter
[36:56] but now it's death not to enter so I'm
[36:59] glad even Paul went on to say let us
[37:01] boldly go before the throne of grace to
[37:03] obtain Mercy to find Grace to help in
[37:05] the time of need and I'm in
[37:08] need he said let us therefore Brethren
[37:11] have boldness to enter in by the blood
[37:14] of Jesus enter into the holy of holies
[37:17] enter into that omnipotent
[37:19] power I I got phone right
[37:29] so we can enter
[37:31] in can enter in I want to read something
[37:37] here scientists discovered over the
[37:39] years
[37:41] that
[37:43] grudges causes high blood pressure can't
[37:47] hold any
[37:48] grudges they discovered that hatred
[37:50] causes
[37:52] heart can't have any
[37:54] hat they discovered that worry is causes
[37:58] horses and the prophet taught us
[38:00] variation there's no virtue in it at
[38:03] all there we are taught they discovered
[38:06] that bitterness causes cancerous
[38:09] cells and then I added one jealousy
[38:13] causes
[38:14] murder now you can murder someone
[38:17] naturally or spiritually you can kill
[38:19] their
[38:20] character see so so we don't want any
[38:23] parts of that and and Paul even talked
[38:25] about
[38:28] Hamas and
[38:29] Pates and they were preaching false
[38:32] Doctrine he he talked about them and he
[38:35] said but their word shall eat like a
[38:38] canker so we can't hold any of those
[38:41] things now that word canker it means
[38:44] gain
[38:45] green it's a disease by which any part
[38:48] of the body suffering from inflammation
[38:51] become so
[38:52] corrupt that unless a remedy be
[38:55] seasonably applied we know the
[38:58] remedy the remedy is the Holy
[39:01] Ghost unless the remedy remedy be
[39:04] seasonably apply apply at the right time
[39:09] the evil continually
[39:11] spreads attacks other parts of the
[39:16] body that's why the prophet taught us
[39:18] that he said the enemy will come in and
[39:19] try to bring
[39:21] isms but let it shape up or ship
[39:25] out because it can destroy the body
[39:28] someone come to you to speak against
[39:29] someone say let's pray
[39:32] for
[39:35] amen we don't want any gossip you
[39:38] remember the Corinthians were in all of
[39:40] that you remember but the Ephesians were
[39:42] so much further along Paul told the
[39:44] Ephesians you know the Galatians were
[39:46] putting burdens Galatians were putting
[39:48] burdens on the people wanted them to
[39:50] receive it by by law and by works and
[39:53] they received it by Grace the Romans got
[39:56] self-righteous
[39:58] the Hebrews were legalistic because Paul
[40:00] said you should have been teachers and
[40:01] now you need to be
[40:04] taught the Corinthians were babies they
[40:07] couldn't even take bely could take the
[40:09] milk see they couldn't even receive
[40:12] strong
[40:12] meat but the Hebrews couldn't receive
[40:15] strong meat but
[40:17] Ephesians Paul said I he said I've heard
[40:20] of you he didn't say I heard of your
[40:22] gossip to the Ephesians and the
[40:24] Colossians and the Philippians and even
[40:27] the Thessalonians he said I heard of
[40:30] your faith in the Lord Jesus and your
[40:33] love toward all the saints not of your
[40:36] gossip not of your backbiting not of
[40:38] your hatred and grudges and all those
[40:40] things and isms but I heard of your
[40:42] faith in the Lord Jesus and your love
[40:45] toward all the saints ammen don't you
[40:47] want God to say that about you he can
[40:49] say that about Higher Ground Tabernacle
[40:51] amen praise the Liv I heard of your
[40:54] faith I've heard of your love amen
[40:58] praise the Living God and this message
[40:59] is to produce another Ephesian church

[41:04] doing we don't want all that other stuff
[41:07] that that chipm chatter chatter chatter
[41:10] you know job had three
[41:12] friends

[41:21] dogmatic that's what one one of dog he
[41:25] was dogmatic one of them meant uh uh one
[41:28] of them meant
[41:29] contention and the other other one it
[41:32] meant

[41:35] chatter see that chipmunk Shadow just
[41:38] gossip the latest
[41:40] gossip you know they they criticize many
[41:43] times they criticize the they always say
[41:47] the sisters gossip gossip but you know

[41:51] than sisters they say what they want to
[41:53] say it's the truth you know I'm telling
[41:57] you
[41:58] I had to call one brother when he called
[42:01] me I said brother it wasn't

[42:07] to tell you I'm not an information
[42:09] center I said go somewhere else I said

[42:21] the office Les you tell
[42:24] it and it's it's seal
[42:27] because I've learned we
[42:30] must

[42:37] that I said I will not preach your sins
[42:39] on the pull pit I'm not going to throw
[42:42] slams upon you I come to you
[42:51] proud praise the Living God
[42:57] so it spreads throughout the body evily
[43:00] evil continually spreads attacks other
[43:03] parts of the body and at last eats away
[43:07] the bones you see how deadly that
[43:11] is so thank God for Grace it takes the
[43:15] supernatural Holy Ghost to come and take
[43:17] everything out that's not like him can't
[43:20] have any
[43:23] hatred many of them want to operate in
[43:26] these amip po
[43:28] and as the prophet taught him how can I
[43:30] teach them algebra when they don't know
[43:32] the
[43:33] ABCs amen praise the Living God so now
[43:37] as we move on I'm glad for the ABCs but
[43:40] let us go into Perfection amen don't you
[43:43] love it see the broad goes all the way
[43:45] cuz God have no pleasure in them to draw
[43:47] back but them that go all the way to the
[43:50] saving of the Soul I'm going all the way
[43:52] to the saving of the
[43:54] Soul amen one song Say all the
[43:58] way so when my man lives by faith and
[44:01] walks by faith I mean substance Faith
[44:05] he's isolated from the entire world and
[44:08] becomes a new creature in Christ there
[44:11] now you're getting in the bride
[44:13] material you see see you're getting in
[44:16] the raping condition amen that's what we
[44:19] need raping Faith must be preached in
[44:21] order to have rap in faith
[44:24] amen that means for each of us not just
[44:28] the
[44:28] pastor the deacons the
[44:31] [Music]
[44:33] trustees that means for the Ley see
[44:36] sister H Wy got sister hety Wright got
[44:39] in the right channel it's not just the
[44:41] pastor it's not just the deacons not
[44:43] just the
[44:44] trustees you know in the olden days back
[44:47] in the time of the the the anglian
[44:49] church they were
[44:51] teaching that during the time John
[44:54] Wesley and uh Whitfield was on the scene
[44:59] they were teaching that only the the
[45:02] clergy can be born again so the sister
[45:06] start having Bible studies in her
[45:08] home that's how
[45:11] Whitfield heard the gospel in his day he
[45:14] and John Wesley were together even when
[45:17] John Wesley horse broke his leg or had
[45:20] that
[45:21] inine
[45:23] but and we know that's a false Doctrine
[45:26] it's for every son and daughter of God
[45:28] because it's already written in Jeremiah
[45:31] 31:31 behold I will make a New Covenant
[45:34] with my people not as I wrote on the
[45:37] tables of stone but I will write my laws
[45:40] in their minds and in their hearts
[45:42] Ezekiel said I will take away the Stony
[45:44] heart and give you a heart of Flesh I
[45:46] will give you a new heart which is a new
[45:49] way of thinking I will give you a new
[45:51] spirit which is new desires and then I
[45:54] put my spirit within you say the Lord
[45:57] he said in Jeremiah 31 All Shall know me
[46:01] from the least to the greatest not just
[46:03] the preachers not just the fivefold
[46:06] ministry but every son and daughter of
[46:08] God shall know me say the Lord of host
[46:10] that's God's covenant no man died for
[46:13] you it's Jesus Christ he's the mediator
[46:17] he's the only mediator between God and
[46:19] man so there's no man in this that's why
[46:22] the prophet said many are establishing
[46:24] them own their own self in the heart of
[46:26] the people
[46:27] but we are called to establish the word
[46:30] of God in the hearts of the people amen
[46:34] amen and only the word of God not
[46:37] ourselves Jesus made himself of no
[46:40] reputation it's not I to do with the
[46:42] work but my father dwell the thing to me
[46:44] he said my father is greater than me
[46:46] amen greater than I amen praise the
[46:49] Living God you know sometime up here I

[52:03] just simply turn him
[52:06] down just resist him let us just walk
[52:10] away from him you young people

[52:21] dangerous you got to shun the very
[52:22] appearance of

[52:32] ability God said a certain thing no
[52:34] matter what he's trying to tell you you
[52:36] don't even listen to him your ears are

[52:45] that listens see what the spirit say to
[52:47] the churches the one that's got the
[52:50] listening post that catches what the

[52:55] see he an ear let him hear what the
[52:57] spirit said into the
[53:01] churches that's bride
[53:03] material and the Lord God as we read God
[53:07] changed his
[53:09] ministry in him from
[53:12] Miracles the teaching of the word
[53:15] because we know the greatest healing is
[53:17] the healing of the Soul remember in St
[53:19] Luke 108
[53:23] 17-9 the Lord Jesus when they went the
[53:26] disciples went to him Lord even Spirits
[53:28] are subject unto us through that
[53:30] name but there were others casting out
[53:33] demons wasn't even falling after him he
[53:37] but he said Rejoice not cuz CU demons
[53:39] Spirits are s under you but joice
[53:42] Rejoice rather because your names are
[53:43] written in heaven and then in Luke 15
[53:46] what it tells us it tells us that when a
[53:50] sinner
[53:51] repent it never said that when a person
[53:54] is healed of a physical sickness in the
[53:57] body that there was joy in the presence
[54:00] of the Angels but when a sinner repents
[54:03] when a sinner comes to be a saint amen
[54:06] when a drunker and a liar comes to be a
[54:08] son and daughter of God Amen when a
[54:12] street woman becomes a lady hey man when
[54:15] a drunken becomes a gentleman there's
[54:18] joy in the presence of the Angels over
[54:21] one sinner that repented
[54:25] heyen bless this wonderful name aren't

[54:30] that is the greatest healing the healing
[54:32] of the soul that word come into the soul

[54:44] surely you could read between the lines
[54:46] you're not that blind notice as soon as
[54:49] God changes Ministry his miracles went
[54:52] on but not like that he begin to tell
[54:54] them the straight scripture truth
[54:56] where they were
[54:58] standing the crowd walked away from him
[55:01] this is a hard saying what happened see
[55:05] you had to tell them where they are
[55:08] standing but I'm glad he came to tell me
[55:11] where I was
[55:13] standing because where I was standing
[55:17] the wrath of God was against me remember
[55:21] Ephesians we were all by Nature the
[55:23] children of Wrath

[56:43] glad amen you know there was a time when
[56:47] when Israel was in Exile and I love Ezra
[56:50] and Nehemiah I love to read about them
[56:53] they were devout men of prayer and and
[56:56] men that stood and they they got to a
[56:59] place where they applied the word to
[57:01] them themselves first before they
[57:04] applied it to the people they wanted to
[57:06] be right before they going to give it to
[57:08] the people and up until that time Israel
[57:11] was never even called a people of the
[57:14] book until that time in that era they
[57:17] were called a people of the book then
[57:19] and we SE that
[57:22] Ezra and neemi there was a time course
[57:25] Ezra was used used to build the temple
[57:27] and Nehemiah was used to build the wall
[57:30] and even though San Balon and Tobias
[57:32] came when the work of the Lord was going
[57:34] on they try to talk nemiah out of it to
[57:37] come down nemiah said we're not coming
[57:40] down amen you can tell him we're not
[57:42] coming down we caught up in the mystery
[57:45] of the seven seal and we're not coming
[57:47] down we are caught up in his unipotent
[57:49] powers and we're not coming down s bad
[57:52] and tabas even begin to tell them and
[57:54] they lied and they they said we're Jews
[57:57] also but they were not Jews they were
[57:59] Liars then they paid a false prophet to
[58:03] go prophesy to neemi they paid him off
[58:06] see we're not hard servants amen we love
[58:10] the Lord and we love his people so we're
[58:12] not we're not harling see a harling
[58:15] don't care for The Souls of the people a
[58:17] harling just want his pay God call him
[58:20] in Isaiah 56 greedy dogs you know he Al
[58:24] also call them dumb dogs so what they
[58:26] have they have
[58:28] GDs greedy dogs and they have DDS dumb
[58:32] dogs God call them dumb dogs and greedy
[58:35] dogs amen it's the truth and Paul said
[58:38] Beware of dogs amen and Jesus said
[58:41] Beware of wolfs so they're hings they're
[58:44] wols they're greedy dogs and dumb dogs
[58:48] I'm not just saying that God call them
[58:50] that amen we can speak the truth in love
[58:55] we don't have to be dog
[58:56] but we have to tell the truth in
[59:00] love praise the Living
[59:02] God so he said we're not coming
[59:07] down even balam balam was hard curse him
[59:12] you can't curse what God has blessed no
[59:13] one can curse you they'll only bless you
[59:17] they can't curse you because you're
[59:19] under the blood you are Abraham's raw
[59:21] seed and no one can curse the raw Seed
[59:24] of Abraham could only bless can you
[59:27] imagine balum even this even this female
[59:30] donkey women preachers always try to get
[59:32] me well God can use a donkey he could
[59:34] use me I said but remember it was a
[59:37] female donkey that spoke with a man's
[59:40] voice so they back up then I have to say
[59:43] there's one one woman preacher with two
[59:45] of them said do you mean to tell me all
[59:47] that white stuff comes out of my mouth
[59:50] when I speak in tongues that I don't
[59:51] have the Holy Ghost I said according to
[59:53] scripture anyone that formed out the
[59:55] mouth was Poss possessed with a demon
[59:58] they got so upset their brother came out
[1:00:00] the room after me with a shotgun I had
[1:00:04] to
[1:00:05] leave he couldn't take the
[1:00:08] word but you imagine this this female
[1:00:11] donkey speaking to balam and he it
[1:00:14] didn't dawn on him wait a minute my
[1:00:15] donkey is talking to me in my
[1:00:18] language you know to to the donkey it
[1:00:20] was tongues but here his he having a
[1:00:24] conversation with this donkey you know
[1:00:26] Lord have
[1:00:29] mercy I mean that's really blind a
[1:00:32] donkey that never talked to you and now
[1:00:34] he's talking to you and you still going
[1:00:36] on to try to curse the children is that
[1:00:40] should have woke him up God have mercy
[1:00:44] he was
[1:00:49] blinded I'm that's why I'm so thankful
[1:00:52] it's God that open our eyes that's why
[1:00:54] Jesus could say blessed are your eyes
[1:00:56] for you see we have nothing to do with
[1:00:58] it if we ever think we have anything to
[1:01:01] do with it we've gotten off the beaten
[1:01:03] path we got to if we ever think we have
[1:01:05] anything in it CU we
[1:01:07] don't we can Rejoice we can rejoice in
[1:01:11] it cuz the Lord Jesus Rejoice Amen in
[1:01:14] Matthew 11 he Matthew 11:25 he said oh
[1:01:17] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth the
[1:01:19] Bible say he rejoiced in the spirit and
[1:01:21] say I thank thee Oh father I thank thee
[1:01:23] for hiding these things from the wise
[1:01:25] and prudent and revealing them under
[1:01:27] babes and the prophet added such as we
[1:01:30] learn
[1:01:32] amen praise the Living God so now what
[1:01:36] do we see some people gets the wrong
[1:01:39] impression of what the anointing is did
[1:01:41] you ever think of that when was the
[1:01:42] greatest anointing ever give to anyone
[1:01:45] what did it they do when they when they
[1:01:47] had the the anointing the greatest
[1:01:49] anointing that was ever GI to anyone was
[1:01:52] Jesus Christ we have the spirit by
[1:01:55] measure he had it without magic and one
[1:01:59] day he entered into the temple picked up
[1:02:00] the stro and read it and said the spirit
[1:02:02] of the Lord is upon me for he has
[1:02:04] anointed me the priest the accepted of a
[1:02:06] year to bind up the broken hearts to
[1:02:08] heal the sick to give sight to the blind
[1:02:11] now we would think of such anointing was
[1:02:13] on him that been prophesied 800 years
[1:02:16] before that it would
[1:02:17] come with that type of anointing the
[1:02:20] full blessing and anointing of the Lord
[1:02:22] upon him we will want to run all over
[1:02:24] the building
[1:02:26] streaming
[1:02:28] Hollow but the Bible said he laid down
[1:02:30] the strob he sat down and precious words
[1:02:33] proceeded from his mouth that's what he
[1:02:35] done under the anointing the anointing
[1:02:38] is not emotions now I love to shout at
[1:02:41] times when it hit me it just
[1:02:44] happens it happens when it happens you
[1:02:47] can't manufacture it but we can't jump
[1:02:49] no heart and we live but when it comes
[1:02:52] praise the Lord I love it there Joy
[1:02:55] bells ringing in my my soul the priest
[1:02:57] danced because and there was noise in
[1:03:00] there when they heard that noise and
[1:03:02] they hear those Bears it could say I
[1:03:04] couldn't imagine Joy bells ringing in my
[1:03:07] soul Joy bells ringing in my soul amen
[1:03:11] hallelujah Joy bells ringing Joy bells
[1:03:14] ringing Joy bells ringing in my soul
[1:03:20] amen because anything that don't have
[1:03:22] emotions is dead and need to be bad
[1:03:26] anyway amen so I'm not speaking against
[1:03:31] motions but anointing is supreme power
[1:03:35] in control like knowing exactly what and
[1:03:40] how see and that's what's here
[1:03:43] see and the secret is what the word is
[1:03:46] in the bride as it was in Mary she knows
[1:03:51] what he wants done with the word she
[1:03:53] keeps still until she have th set the
[1:03:55] Lord see we don't have to manufacture
[1:03:57] anything
[1:03:59] amen we don't have to prove anything to
[1:04:01] the devil God will use us to prove to
[1:04:04] the devil as the song says M I'm in a
[1:04:07] lot of songs tonight but Satan we're
[1:04:10] going to tellar your kingdom down amen
[1:04:13] you've been building your kingdom all
[1:04:16] over this land but Satan we going to
[1:04:19] tear your kingdom down amen we boast in
[1:04:23] the Lord
[1:04:28] so that's the greatest anointing we're
[1:04:30] so thankful all right here was voices Oh
[1:04:35] how we need in here today not just Zep
[1:04:39] but thousands of Little voices the
[1:04:42] Thunder of God burning out sweetness and
[1:04:45] Holiness and Purity undefiled lives
[1:04:48] walking around in the Earth today
[1:04:50] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:04:53] Christians that Thunder against the
[1:04:55] enemy
[1:04:57] me the devil don't care how loud you
[1:05:00] holler now notice in the time of
[1:05:03] Ezra as Ezra read the word the Bible say
[1:05:07] he stand aloud he read aloud he stand
[1:05:10] upon the pull pit of wood he was above
[1:05:13] the people and he read aloud the law and
[1:05:17] as he read the people begin to weep they
[1:05:21] wept they wept because they did not
[1:05:24] understand but then the scripture tells
[1:05:26] us that those priests went to the people
[1:05:31] and caused the people to understand and
[1:05:34] begin to tell them this is not the time
[1:05:35] of weeping this is the time of rejoicing
[1:05:39] amen John we bility before he understood
[1:05:42] but when he recognized who he was when
[1:05:45] he recognized his name he cried
[1:05:48] out
[1:05:50] amen so without a revelation yeah they
[1:05:52] could walk and be sad but once the word
[1:05:55] is revealed to
[1:05:57] you see it's not just the opening of the
[1:05:59] word and revealing of the word to the
[1:06:01] prophet no now that opening and
[1:06:03] revealing must be to us remember to the
[1:06:06] Gentiles individual see behold I send
[1:06:09] you Elijah the prophet it's personal you
[1:06:12] got to take it personal if one going in
[1:06:15] the Rapture you should say I'm not one
[1:06:18] you should have that much
[1:06:19] Faith to say I'm not one praise the lord
[1:06:24] it's to the individual is
[1:06:27] personal so they broke it down to the
[1:06:29] people I said Lord cuz I asked the Lord
[1:06:32] I said the prophet said birth pains he
[1:06:34] said now I'm laying the seed out but if
[1:06:37] it if it be the will of the Lord he said
[1:06:38] these ministers will come along bring it
[1:06:41] to life make more sense of what I'm
[1:06:44] saying just like those priests in the
[1:06:47] time of Ezra they took what Ezra read
[1:06:50] and they caused the people to
[1:06:53] understand he's the same yesterday today
[1:06:56] and
[1:06:57] forever and now the Holy
[1:06:59] Ghost through the 5f and it don't stop
[1:07:02] as we said earlier it does not stop at
[1:07:04] the fivefold but the Holy Ghost because
[1:07:07] why we must have the not just the inside
[1:07:09] dress but we must have the inside
[1:07:12] teach
[1:07:19] amen yes there real Christians that
[1:07:21] Thunder against the enemy the devil
[1:07:23] don't care how loud you can hide
[1:07:27] remember on the day of
[1:07:29] Pentecost ask of the Holy
[1:07:32] Spirit when Peter baptized 3,000
[1:07:37] Souls devil didn't even move out of his
[1:07:40] bed didn't even turn
[1:07:43] over when he saw a manifested
[1:07:47] life knocked him off his place
[1:07:51] amen the devil don't care how much you
[1:07:53] can jump how much you can do this a
[1:07:55] shout
[1:07:56] but What Hurts The Devil is to see that
[1:07:58] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[1:08:01] say anything to him call him anything
[1:08:04] see it's not Paul I know Jesus I know
[1:08:06] brother brandom I know brother Isaiah
[1:08:08] Brooks I know but who are you the devil
[1:08:10] should say the same thing about you it's
[1:08:13] the truth you know every son and
[1:08:15] daughter of God he should be afraid of
[1:08:18] and believe it or not he is afraid of
[1:08:19] you but you have to understand that he's
[1:08:22] afraid of you more than you realize
[1:08:27] call him anything just as sweet as it
[1:08:29] can be and move right on oh my that
[1:08:32] throws him away that's the Thunder that
[1:08:34] shakes the
[1:08:38] devil something jump up and down and
[1:08:40] holler the prophet just went up and said
[1:08:43] Satan leave him leave her in the name of
[1:08:47] Jesus Christ wasn't all that jumping and
[1:08:49] holling and streaming you know the
[1:08:51] disciples as the prophet said the
[1:08:52] disciples went out we cast you out we
[1:08:54] cast you out so the devil didn't didn't
[1:08:57] move when you walk with authority
[1:09:00] knowing who you are amen after the Holy
[1:09:02] Ghost comes upon you you shall receive
[1:09:05] power now notice they were given one
[1:09:07] power before the Holy Ghost was
[1:09:10] given power which was
[1:09:13] Authority now that was different but on
[1:09:16] the coming of the Holy Ghost they were
[1:09:18] given another Power amen
[1:09:22] dunamus Christ in you
[1:09:25] there was a
[1:09:30] difference there's a
[1:09:35] difference I'm coming
[1:09:39] down you people here
[1:09:42] tonight God is depending on you to
[1:09:47] project his love to the CER there's
[1:09:50] something about a man or woman there's
[1:09:53] something about a man or a woman you you
[1:09:55] are a miniature Creator this is our
[1:09:58] climax right here you are a miniature
[1:10:02] Creator have you ever seen people that
[1:10:04] you just love to be
[1:10:06] around it's the atmosphere they create
[1:10:09] around you other nice people you just
[1:10:13] can't stand to be around they create
[1:10:16] that by the way they live the way they
[1:10:19] think it's a little atmosphere you live
[1:10:21] in got to be the it's the atmosphere it
[1:10:25] got to to be the right
[1:10:27] atmosphere we have to continue to dig
[1:10:30] the prophet say I will continue to dig
[1:10:32] and humble thyself he said if you want
[1:10:33] to miss the tribulation you got to dig
[1:10:36] keep digging he said I'm going to keep
[1:10:37] digging he said we got to keep digging
[1:10:39] deeper and deeper we can never get
[1:10:42] enough of this it's like in the middle
[1:10:43] of an ocean you know it's so much
[1:10:47] worse you know shall of water you jump
[1:10:50] in it you take a dive in it you going
[1:10:53] get hurt you can dive all day in deep
[1:10:56] water amen hallelujah so we love the
[1:10:59] Lord Jesus
[1:11:02] Christ as the prophet taught us when the
[1:11:04] supernatural comes in it's the mind of
[1:11:08] Christ it's far from our own
[1:11:11] thinking that's where God want us to
[1:11:16] live that's where he wants us to
[1:11:18] live now
[1:11:20] notice perfect faith is a master of all
[1:11:23] circumstances
[1:11:25] perfect Faith Masters all circumstances
[1:11:27] no matter what it is it Masters
[1:11:32] it and we were created to master to
[1:11:35] become master of all circumstance
[1:11:37] remember earlier Isaiah said arise from
[1:11:40] any circumstance that that perhaps got
[1:11:42] you in depression you know I found out
[1:11:45] it shouldn't be among us but a lot of
[1:11:48] people and and and Lord forgive me but a
[1:11:51] lot of
[1:11:52] people maybe I hope there's no doctors
[1:11:55] and nurses in here if you are forgive
[1:11:58] me but a lot of people they are on
[1:12:05] medicine it shouldn't be among the bride
[1:12:07] I'm telling you it should not be among
[1:12:09] the bride we have an anointed word here
[1:12:12] to deliver from all of those things but
[1:12:15] we did a little study on it and and and
[1:12:18] and it shows that the
[1:12:20] pharmacist the
[1:12:22] psychiatrist and the physician not all
[1:12:25] of them all of them
[1:12:28] not one doctor my my uncle my uncle was
[1:12:32] 80 something years old 87 he passed away
[1:12:35] at 87 never had a toothache he never
[1:12:37] drunk any whiskey or anything like that
[1:12:41] never never was
[1:12:43] sick but he started having some heart
[1:12:46] situations problems and he
[1:12:49] went to Charon so he asked the doctor
[1:12:52] why are you sending me to chareston he
[1:12:54] said to be honest with you I would make
[1:12:56] more money if I send you the child
[1:12:58] that's was the only
[1:13:00] reason so uh but every doctor is not
[1:13:02] like that but we found out that some of
[1:13:06] the people got in went in Disguise as
[1:13:09] patients and they went in Disguise as
[1:13:11] employees for these other people and
[1:13:14] they reported and show how the
[1:13:18] pharmacist many of the pharmacists
[1:13:20] psychiatrists and the doctors work
[1:13:23] together to get a patient for life
[1:13:25] that's their whole goal they got and
[1:13:28] they this book got thicker and thicker
[1:13:30] of all these different diseases they
[1:13:32] call psychiatrist name the book begin to
[1:13:36] grow and grow and
[1:13:37] grow and it got to a point where and
[1:13:40] they give him all these disas these
[1:13:42] medicines that cause a suicidal you look
[1:13:44] at the read the after facts a lot of
[1:13:47] after
[1:13:50] facts and young people were just killing
[1:13:52] themselves because of that medicine they
[1:13:54] they they it it was proven to be that
[1:13:58] reason why and and then uh but many of
[1:14:01] them were were viewed and and they they
[1:14:05] got where if you turn if they go send
[1:14:07] them to psch psychiatrist they got where
[1:14:11] they would actually U the psychologist
[1:14:14] if a person a patient refused a medicine
[1:14:17] they had even a a disease for that
[1:14:21] really is in the book if they refuse to
[1:14:23] take medicine they call that something
[1:14:26] so they couldn't get around it they were
[1:14:28] determined to have a
[1:14:30] patient because they it was a it's a
[1:14:32] money scheme everyone get a percentage
[1:14:35] for life can you imagine that I mean
[1:14:38] that's pretty good when you got 2,000
[1:14:40] patients and if it only $5 you know a
[1:14:43] month you
[1:14:45] know so Lord have mercy
[1:14:55] and now when the Brethren receive the
[1:14:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this
[1:14:59] is the summit this is all of it but
[1:15:01] Brethren that's wrong see there's no
[1:15:03] Summit to God's power we move on and on
[1:15:07] and on it's unlimited resources of God
[1:15:10] has never been ta yet blessings and
[1:15:13] powers that we know nothing about it's
[1:15:16] never been even revealed to archangels
[1:15:18] hey man that we have a song The Angels
[1:15:21] can't sing hey man aren't you glad oh
[1:15:24] the angels have to sit and listen to our
[1:15:27] song of redemption oh praise the Lord
[1:15:29] we'll sing a song of redemption they
[1:15:32] will not join along because they don't
[1:15:34] know the song they don't know him as a
[1:15:36] redeemer they don't know him as a
[1:15:38] deliverer they don't know him as a
[1:15:40] Healer praise the Lord but we can sing
[1:15:43] Redemption
[1:15:44] story amen oh Victory in Jesus my Savior
[1:15:50] forever he sought me and bought me with
[1:15:53] his redeeming blood amen he love me now
[1:15:56] yeah I know
[1:15:58] him amen bless his wonderful name so
[1:16:01] it's not even revealed the archangels is
[1:16:04] laying just ahead for his church that
[1:16:06] will
[1:16:07] believe for I have not seen ear have not
[1:16:10] heard neither has it in in the heart of
[1:16:12] men what God has for them in store that
[1:16:15] love him so let's move up and claim our
[1:16:19] rights amen as God opens the gates and
[1:16:23] swings out the we command let's move on
[1:16:26] up into deeper deaths and never colonize
[1:16:29] ourself to organize ourself we put a
[1:16:33] period on the word we die Enoch had a
[1:16:35] progressive walk the prophet had a
[1:16:38] progressive walk a lot of people don't
[1:16:40] like that the prophet made mistakes but
[1:16:43] when the seals were open all those
[1:16:45] mistakes were corrected I believe that
[1:16:48] but at one time he was saying evidence
[1:16:51] of the Holy Ghost fruit of the spirit
[1:16:53] love Meet Joy patience long suffering
[1:16:55] later on he said I used to say that the
[1:16:59] evidence of the Holy Ghost was love he
[1:17:02] said but the Lord in the vision straight
[1:17:04] me out on that but he said the evidence
[1:17:07] of the Holy Ghost is when you can
[1:17:08] receive the word of God for your day and
[1:17:11] walk in it and have a clear
[1:17:13] understanding and he went on to say one
[1:17:16] one place he said the evidence of the
[1:17:18] Holy Ghost he said when the Holy Spirit
[1:17:21] Come And Lead you and guide you in all
[1:17:23] truth and then he also said the evidence
[1:17:26] of the Holy Ghost is those that sign and
[1:17:28] crying out for the Abomination is done
[1:17:31] among the message of our among our ranks
[1:17:34] that's where we place it
[1:17:35] today then he also said the evidence of
[1:17:39] the Holy Ghost he said the real you is
[1:17:41] the
[1:17:42] je so he had a progressive
[1:17:46] walk they say he's infallible but you
[1:17:48] know he said I'm not infallible he said
[1:17:51] that's the offest thing to say that I'm
[1:17:53] infallible he said the word of of the
[1:17:55] Lord is infallible amen God don't build
[1:17:58] a revelation on any man he didn't build
[1:18:01] it upon Peter he didn't build it upon
[1:18:03] Paul he didn't build it upon the prophet
[1:18:05] he build it upon the spiritual
[1:18:07] revelation of who he is that's what hell
[1:18:10] is against amen I don't want a
[1:18:13] second-handed revelation now I thank God
[1:18:16] for a second-handed robe amen the same
[1:18:19] robe that Elijah wor Elisha wor Elisha
[1:18:23] had to grow to it
[1:18:26] but it was a firsthand experience cuz
[1:18:28] Elijah said where is the Lord God of
[1:18:31] Elijah and Elijah did four Miracles
[1:18:35] Elisha did eight Miracles the same God
[1:18:38] the same word the same
[1:18:43] Revelation it had to be
[1:18:46] personal have to be
[1:18:49] personal because it because God won't
[1:18:51] share his glory with the
[1:18:55] so I'm so
[1:19:04] thankful have to move on
[1:19:07] Amen to get into a place where this we
[1:19:10] believe this and that's all let's
[1:19:12] believe this plus how much more we can
[1:19:14] hear from God I think that ought to be
[1:19:17] the motive of every man and woman that
[1:19:18] loves the Lord Jesus to receive all that
[1:19:21] you can from the hand of his Bountiful
[1:19:23] mercies that that's my heart that's the
[1:19:26] reason I never joined any organization
[1:19:28] or took sides with any group why you put
[1:19:31] a period you
[1:19:32] die because I wanted myself wide open
[1:19:36] for the love of God and for what he
[1:19:38] could give to
[1:19:39] me that's our desire
[1:19:43] amen the church ought to be grown by
[1:19:46] this time but many of us who ought to be
[1:19:49] teaching others or yet design a sincere
[1:19:52] milk of the Bible see we need someone to
[1:19:54] teach us when we should be teachers and
[1:19:57] to know I bow my head in shame that I
[1:20:00] should know more about God than I
[1:20:03] do the prophet saying that about
[1:20:06] himself the Lord told him he he handled
[1:20:09] the first and second poor
[1:20:11] wrong but he said this third
[1:20:14] poor can not be
[1:20:16] pers he said I'm drawing back I'm
[1:20:19] dropping
[1:20:20] back he said what you've seen in a
[1:20:23] minority
[1:20:25] in his
[1:20:26] ministry you will see it in the fullness
[1:20:29] of his power in the bride the cast
[1:20:32] tightens down begins to tighten
[1:20:35] down that's what's happened so now are
[1:20:39] we the Sons and Daughters of
[1:20:41] God now Faith
[1:20:43] is now the brid Revival is
[1:20:49] on Amen will cut every obstacle from
[1:20:53] human beings that they might might be
[1:20:55] connected like the Garden of
[1:20:57] Eden I was going to choke it but I'm
[1:21:00] going to say it man is
[1:21:04] omnipotent unlimited
[1:21:06] Powers you don't believe that but he is
[1:21:09] a man is fully surrendered to God is
[1:21:12] omnipotent did not he say in Mark 11:22
[1:21:16] whatsoever things you say and don't
[1:21:18] doubt in your heart it will come to pass
[1:21:21] you can have what you've said that's
[1:21:24] what we at that's the time we liveing
[1:21:28] in don't look for it down the road it's
[1:21:34] now if you never cried for it how you
[1:21:36] going to get
[1:21:39] it so we believe this plus what God
[1:21:41] going to show will show
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:46] us but the church is always looking back
[1:21:49] let's look up for their powers are
[1:21:52] unlimited and we have unlimited
[1:21:55] power for all things are possible to
[1:21:58] them that believe in God real genuine
[1:22:02] faith will punctuate every word that God
[1:22:04] give with them with a amen not well is
[1:22:07] for another generation I'm not looking
[1:22:09] for another generation is for
[1:22:12] us he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:16] forever now we could have got get any
[1:22:20] continuity amongst Medics amongst
[1:22:22] scientists different ones but if if
[1:22:25] Einstein had only had the spiritual
[1:22:28] application as he had the physical
[1:22:31] application as he studied the laws of
[1:22:33] light and so forth he could have told us
[1:22:35] something when I heard his message on
[1:22:38] the great Center somewhere into the
[1:22:40] skies that ever contacted with that
[1:22:42] Center the center of the universe you
[1:22:46] could create Earth this is what
[1:22:49] Einstein do anything that the power
[1:22:51] would be unlimited see he had seen that
[1:22:56] that's what Einstein see they begin to
[1:22:58] break open dimensions and discovered
[1:23:00] other dimensions you know the First
[1:23:01] Dimension first three light matter time
[1:23:04] which we live in fourth dimension is
[1:23:05] science Fifth Dimension region of the LW
[1:23:07] sixth Dimension region of the saved and
[1:23:09] we know seventh is where God lives
[1:23:12] prophecy God lives out there oh praise
[1:23:15] the Living God but we're connected we as
[1:23:18] a bride of Christ we are connected to
[1:23:20] the sixth and the seventh Dimension we
[1:23:23] heard from our the
[1:23:25] which dwelleth in the sixth and God
[1:23:27] dwelleth in the
[1:23:29] seventh oh praise the Living God but
[1:23:32] Einstein saw the natural part he kept
[1:23:36] splitting
[1:23:37] atoms he saw no end Einstein Des drive
[1:23:41] it is
[1:23:42] this Hebrews 11 for we understand that
[1:23:45] the words were framed by the word of God
[1:23:48] the different dimensions Einstein have
[1:23:51] that theory of relativity
[1:23:54] E equals
[1:23:56] mc² energy e is energy equals mc² m is m
[1:24:01] is
[1:24:02] matter C is
[1:24:04] [Music]
[1:24:06] light what do we have C this
[1:24:10] matter light are theophany amen energy
[1:24:15] is God they call it energy they call it
[1:24:19] a supernatural intelligence they call it
[1:24:22] energy but we know it is God
[1:24:25] the prophet say Einstein used the dark
[1:24:27] side of
[1:24:28] it so what is
[1:24:32] it matter mult multiplied times the
[1:24:36] speed of light squared
[1:24:38] 186,000 miles per second times 186,000
[1:24:43] miles per second like magic equals
[1:24:46] anybody want to
[1:24:53] tell
[1:24:56] 596
[1:24:57] billion miles per
[1:25:00] second times
[1:25:03] matter so the prophet said we will move
[1:25:07] he said we take billions of miles per
[1:25:09] second so
[1:25:12] billions billions that's what he
[1:25:14] said 596 billion miles per second now I
[1:25:18] can't comprehend that it's
[1:25:22] incomprehensible but that's how fast we
[1:25:24] a travel like a thought in a moment of
[1:25:26] Twinkle that word moment it means Adam
[1:25:29] aommy oh God we enter into something we
[1:25:33] entering in omnipotent powers of God hey
[1:25:37] man to shake the enemy so let us enter
[1:25:39] in by the blood of Jesus Christ we can
[1:25:42] live in that place we can live in that
[1:25:44] world of perfect Faith Hallelujah that's
[1:25:46] right we can coner sickness we can
[1:25:50] conquer all things in Christ we are
[1:25:53] possessing all things
[1:25:55] you believe that we are the Bride of
[1:25:57] Jesus Christ that's what we come we are
[1:26:01] we we have
[1:26:02] arrived so Einstein only had that part
[1:26:05] look what the prophet told
[1:26:09] us as much as your faith will be
[1:26:13] released that's how much power you can
[1:26:16] have see according to your faith being
[1:26:18] unto you as much
[1:26:20] faith will be released as much power you
[1:26:23] can have
[1:26:25] because in you dwells the power to make
[1:26:27] heavens and earth God dwells in you and
[1:26:30] you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:26:35] Amen I'm talking about an absolute
[1:26:38] connected with Christ your thinking is
[1:26:41] altogether different than the thinking
[1:26:43] you once did because you have found
[1:26:45] something that you've anchored a faith
[1:26:48] in someone that created the heavens and
[1:26:50] the Earth that's his very word itself is
[1:26:55] created a God who spoke the world into
[1:26:59] existence and there's nothing to hard
[1:27:01] for him so it makes you create yourself
[1:27:04] because you take his word and the word
[1:27:06] is his thought expressed so in
[1:27:11] you you could create you believe that
[1:27:14] said the time coming where missing limbs
[1:27:16] will be
[1:27:17] restored say wait to those wait to those
[1:27:20] Thunders Ed voice of that little group
[1:27:22] this said Thunders you know the devil
[1:27:24] has put a scarecrow up about the seven
[1:27:26] Thunders but notice the seven Thunders
[1:27:28] is in Revelation 10 it's the bride's
[1:27:30] inheritance seven Thunders Thunder is
[1:27:33] the voice of God Seven means completion
[1:27:37] the seven Thunders is the word of the
[1:27:38] Lord revealed in its entirety so we're
[1:27:41] not afraid of the seventh Thunders it's
[1:27:43] the brid's Revival hey this what's going
[1:27:45] to produce rapt and faith in our hearts
[1:27:48] praise the Lord the prophet say shall it
[1:27:50] be something that'll cause us to run
[1:27:52] through troops and leap over walls
[1:27:54] is such a power that God is releasing un
[1:27:58] us that's what it is because he sent the
[1:28:02] quality of the word and the quality of
[1:28:04] the spirit that's why the fullness of
[1:28:06] the word had to be restored back so the
[1:28:08] fullness of the Holy Ghost could be
[1:28:10] loosed that was bound by Creeds and
[1:28:13] dogmas now you can ask whatever you will
[1:28:15] you can live in that omnipotent powers
[1:28:17] of God Amen praise the Living God you
[1:28:20] know it's time for us to recognize Who
[1:28:22] We Are
[1:28:24] that's what perfect faith is the prophet
[1:28:26] said knowing where you stand he said
[1:28:29] that's one of the curses people don't
[1:28:31] know where to
[1:28:33] stand I'm so glad it's the everpresent
[1:28:36] water from the
[1:28:38] rock it's Jesus Christ in
[1:28:41] action say when it utter its voice to
[1:28:44] that little group when the footage of
[1:28:46] the word being revealed to that little
[1:28:47] group she will slice she will cut she
[1:28:51] can call for a 100 billion flies if she
[1:28:54] want to she can create worlds if she

[1:34:16] revelation to you he said you can speak
[1:34:18] it Hallelujah and the prophet went on to

[1:36:22] say
[1:36:23] Jesus Took water and turned to Wine
[1:36:26] Jesus Took bread and fish and
[1:36:28] multiplied but where there was no
[1:36:31] squirrels Let There Be what happened
[1:36:34] created Power came in this end time the
[1:36:37] Lord Jesus could have create but he he
[1:36:39] held back he only
[1:36:41] multiplied remember a time the prophet
[1:36:44] said St John 14:12 Greater Works why
[1:36:46] because more of us but then later in 64
[1:36:49] Shalom message turn on the light and
[1:36:52] Look Away to Jesus all the
[1:36:55] 64 progressed in Revelation but all
[1:36:59] those years he was saying more of us
[1:37:01] Greater Works more of us then he got to
[1:37:04] that place he said Jesus Took water turn
[1:37:07] the wine repeat myself Jesus Took fish
[1:37:10] and bread and multiplied but in this day
[1:37:14] where there was no squirels let there be
[1:37:18] it was a difference what is it God
[1:37:20] bringing created Power what Adam and Eve
[1:37:23] lost
[1:37:24] what Adam could have come to if he
[1:37:27] wouldn't have fall Redemption

[1:37:33] would have had eaten himself into that
[1:37:35] third pool in that in that fullness of
[1:37:38] of immortal
[1:37:40] bodies but God held it and it was a
[1:37:43] secret kept from the found kept all
[1:37:46] those times many of the Prophet Sal
[1:37:48] visions of this end time wanted to live

[1:39:34] perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by
[1:39:36] his perfect word which is sharper in any
[1:39:38] two-edged sword the is ear of the
[1:39:40] thoughts of the heart what we're coming
[1:39:43] now to the Perfection because the people
[1:39:46] has to come to this in order to rapture
[1:39:49] we have to come to perfect Faith that's
[1:39:51] why the seventh seal must be preached
[1:39:53] not just six se but the
[1:39:56] seven there was silence in heaven
[1:39:58] remember but on Earth there was noise
[1:40:01] and the Thunders was revealed
[1:40:05] amen that's what's holding it away right
[1:40:07] now is waiting for that church to come
[1:40:09] into that perfect raptured faith I'm
[1:40:13] looking for it it means a lot of shaking
[1:40:15] down for me it means a lot of lot for
[1:40:17] you but together we'll make it by the
[1:40:19] grace of God Amen you believe that
[1:40:24] they see it in the natural we look back
[1:40:27] we see it in the spiritual you here here
[1:40:29] Lord you promis just before the end time
[1:40:33] comes as it was in the days of Sodom and
[1:40:37] gomorra as promis it'll be today
[1:40:40] amen I pray
[1:40:42] father he said father so many could be
[1:40:46] said so much could be said right here so
[1:40:48] many things maybe the church wouldn't
[1:40:50] understand he was saying then but now
[1:40:56] let let remember Jeremiah let not a let
[1:40:59] not a
[1:41:00] uh a mighty man rejoice in his
[1:41:07] might let not a rich man rejoice in his
[1:41:10] riches let him glory in this he
[1:41:14] understand the Lord he said all I get
[1:41:17] and get understanding get wisdom wisdom
[1:41:19] is the principle thing wisdom is Christ
[1:41:22] many seek for the Jews the Greek seeks
[1:41:25] after wisdom but to them that believe is
[1:41:27] Christ the wisdom and the power of God
[1:41:29] so wisdom is
[1:41:31] Christ but I pray that you'll give them
[1:41:33] such a crave for it Lord that they'll
[1:41:36] come and see we're at the end time the
[1:41:38] as age I pray father that they realize
[1:41:41] it isn't trying to condemn what they had
[1:41:44] it's only trying to give them more rap
[1:41:45] in Grace so God is not trying to condemn
[1:41:47] us he want to give us more R in faith
[1:41:50] but the hour will come when when we'll
[1:41:52] have to have Rapture power not only to
[1:41:55] hear the body but to change it in a
[1:41:57] moment twink 11 ey Christ and that's
[1:42:00] where Einstein seen it as we said
[1:42:02] earlier in the na he saw his body
[1:42:05] speeding up the theophany blending in
[1:42:08] with this matter this redeemed body and
[1:42:10] transforming it to a glorified condition
[1:42:12] that's what Einstein see Christ will be
[1:42:15] so real in the in their bodies our
[1:42:17] bodies to he can change it by his great
[1:42:19] death and what he purchased may they
[1:42:22] take this today that token that I spoke
[1:42:25] of hold it before them and walk into
[1:42:28] this astronaut granted father where
[1:42:30] Visions powers and worlds Beyond known
[1:42:34] and oh God where all the great mysteries
[1:42:37] of God is unfolded in those Seven Seals

[1:42:42] they are yours now I realize that all to
[1:42:45] cause is what we do but Lord you said as
[1:42:48] many as believe I pray that you give
