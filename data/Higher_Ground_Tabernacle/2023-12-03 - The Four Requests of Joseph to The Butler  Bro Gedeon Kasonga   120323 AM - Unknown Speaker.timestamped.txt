[59:36] name of the Lord
[59:40] Jesus and I also appreciate the
[59:43] hospitality of Pastor
[59:46] Brooks whom I met for the first time a
[59:49] couple months
[59:51] ago while I was here for a couple of
[59:53] days
[59:57] we met at brother Eugene
[1:00:01] kabamba and just the first time I met
[1:00:03] him I felt like it was already
[1:00:07] working and I told the kids that they
[1:00:10] did not make a mistake by choosing him
[1:00:12] as a
[1:00:13] pastor and I felt that the spirit was
[1:00:17] good and he already sent me an
[1:00:21] invitation and next time I come here
[1:00:23] that I speak for for for his
[1:00:26] church and I'm honored to do it this

[1:00:45] have an exceptional
[1:00:47] thing but in the message there is no new
[1:00:53] thing it is said that when it's new that
[1:00:55] means it's
[1:00:57] false because everything that was that
[1:01:00] is has already been
[1:01:02] before everything has already been said
[1:01:05] in this end
[1:01:07] time and I want to greet the ones who

[1:01:43] Brooks and we we appreciate him so much
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:49] amen without further
[1:01:53] ado
[1:01:57] today we're going to talk about the four
[1:01:59] request of Joseph to the
[1:02:01] butler are we all
[1:02:06] together so for this we're going to turn
[1:02:08] our Bible in the Book of Genesis chapter
[1:02:13] 40 the four requests of Joseph to the
[1:02:18] butler we're going to read it in the
[1:02:20] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:23] Christ
[1:02:25] 40 Genesis
[1:02:27] 4 Genesis 40 vers verse 5 to
[1:02:43] 15 and they dream to dream both of them
[1:02:46] each man his dream in one night each man
[1:02:48] according to the interpretation of
[1:02:53] his
[1:02:55] the Butler and the baker of the king of
[1:02:57] Egypt which were Bound in the
[1:03:03] prison and Joseph came in unto them in
[1:03:06] the morning and looked upon them and
[1:03:08] behold they were
[1:03:15] sad and he asked Pharaoh's officers that
[1:03:18] were with him in the in the W of his
[1:03:20] Lord's House
[1:03:23] saying wherefore look he so sadly
[1:03:26] today and they said unto
[1:03:30] him we have dreamed a
[1:03:34] dream and there is no interpreter of
[1:03:37] it and Joseph said unto
[1:03:42] them do not interpretations belong to
[1:03:47] God tell me them I pray
[1:03:51] you so it's to God to explain the dream
[1:03:56] but it's it was being told
[1:03:59] to so there was a relationship between
[1:04:02] God and
[1:04:05] Joseph and the chief Butler told his
[1:04:07] dream to
[1:04:12] Joseph and said to him in my dream
[1:04:14] Behold a Vine was before
[1:04:17] me and the vine were there three
[1:04:23] branches
[1:04:25] and it was as though it bded and her
[1:04:27] Blossom shot
[1:04:30] forth and the pharaoh's cup was in my
[1:04:37] hand and I took the grapes and pressed
[1:04:39] them into Pharaoh's cop and I give the
[1:04:41] cop into Pharaoh's
[1:04:44] hands and Joseph said unto him this is
[1:04:47] the interpretation of
[1:04:49] it the three branches are three
[1:04:53] days yet within three
[1:04:57] days sh shall Pharaoh lift up that head
[1:05:00] and restore thee unto that
[1:05:03] place and thou sh deliver Pharaoh's cop
[1:05:06] into his
[1:05:08] hand after the former manner when that
[1:05:11] was his
[1:05:14] Butler so this is our four request
[1:05:16] starts right here in verse the first
[1:05:19] request
[1:05:20] is but because you live prison
[1:05:26] he says but think on
[1:05:28] me when it shall be well with
[1:05:32] thee that was the first request of
[1:05:34] Joseph to
[1:05:36] the think on me when it shall be well
[1:05:38] with thee and the
[1:05:43] second and and and
[1:05:46] kindness the third
[1:05:50] request and make mention of me unto
[1:05:53] pharaoh
[1:05:54] and the fourth
[1:05:57] request and bring me out of this out of
[1:06:00] this
[1:06:02] house for indeed I was stolen away from
[1:06:05] the land of
[1:06:08] the and here also have I done nothing
[1:06:11] that they should put me into the dung
[1:06:15] dungeon I thank I thank the
[1:06:18] Lord break the bread of
[1:06:21] life put me aside and take the take the
[1:06:23] god
[1:06:25] and speak to your people Lord amen in
[1:06:28] amen you may regain your
[1:06:31] seat in all the Old
[1:06:38] Testament we know that Joseph is the
[1:06:40] most complete type of Jesus
[1:06:45] Christ so talking about Joseph I'm
[1:06:47] talking about Jesus
[1:06:50] Christ now we're going to see in the
[1:06:52] four request of Joseph
[1:06:55] that he was addressing to the
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:07:01] butler we can see the same for request
[1:07:04] that Jesus addressed to the Disciples of
[1:07:08] today so as I'm talking about
[1:07:11] Joseph I'm referring to Jesus
[1:07:14] Christ when I'm talking about the
[1:07:17] butler I'm talking about you and I'm
[1:07:19] talking about me amen
[1:07:22] amen J let's examine the first request
[1:07:26] of
[1:07:27] Joseph he tells the the
[1:07:33] butler remember about me when you will
[1:07:35] be
[1:07:38] happy after the dream was was
[1:07:42] interpreted the Butler had to get out of
[1:07:46] prison he had to to get his rest and
[1:07:50] Joseph told
[1:07:52] him when you will be happy
[1:07:56] when you will be in your
[1:07:58] Prosperity remember about
[1:08:00] me we
[1:08:03] together remember about
[1:08:05] me because very so
[1:08:08] often when we are in
[1:08:11] prisoned when we are in
[1:08:14] difficulties when we are
[1:08:16] jobless or when you're
[1:08:19] sick we look for we seek for
[1:08:22] Christ we come to church all the
[1:08:25] time we have time for prayer amen
[1:08:31] amen but when we are in
[1:08:36] prosperity once we have we receive what
[1:08:39] we're requested from
[1:08:42] God very often times we forget about
[1:08:46] God and so if God tells you this
[1:08:49] morning when you will be in your
[1:08:52] prosperity when you will be
[1:08:56] happy remember me amen
[1:09:00] amen when God will bless
[1:09:03] you remember about him remember him
[1:09:07] amen it's the very
[1:09:10] truth in our story this
[1:09:13] morning when the butler left the
[1:09:17] prison never remembered about
[1:09:21] Joseph just like many Christians do
[1:09:23] today
[1:09:25] they are in their
[1:09:29] prosperities once they have received
[1:09:31] what they were looking for from
[1:09:33] God they forget God amen
[1:09:37] Amen brother Bram
[1:09:40] says in the scripture on the wall
[1:09:44] handwriting on the wall he says
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:51] thus notice some habits of of people of
[1:09:54] a man when he feels
[1:09:57] insecurity I'm
