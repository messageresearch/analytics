I appreciate you by the grace of God I'd like to say you're welcome to praise and worship God it was at the beginning amen we believe in that Saint John 4 Saint John to be long just a simple message I I still want everybody to understand we Must Destroy all systematic worships many of us throughout the years into worship according to the way the system dictated to us but if God hate it Israel's worship when they came into systematic worships when there is no compassion there is no love when there is uh no heart in his nostrils this is the throne room everything you do for God must be motivated by love not because I have to wonder if somebody told me because I have the love of Jesus Saint John 4 15. Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drink it of this water shall thirst again foreign but whosoever drinketh of the water that I get shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a whale of water springing up into everlasting life remember DC [Applause] the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw La Familia one more passage of scripture Psalms 42 we are going to read from the first to the ninth verse enough I trust everybody be blessed tonight it's a press isn't it you see we have to really press to get here we really have a revelation of the grace of God that means in all of your everyday failures hallelujah amen beginning at the first verse um to the chief musician my skill for the sons of Korah as the heart paneth after the water Brooks so Pandit my soul after thee Oh God [Music] my soul thirsted for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God is my tears have been my meat day and night while they continue to say unto me where is thy God when I remember these things I poured out my soul in me but I had gone out with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of Joy praise in the multitude that kept holy days amen can you hear what he's saying here I went to church the noise of Joy I went with the multitude when they were praising him but my soul still thirst Hallelujah why God thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the hermanites from the hill of mizar munami OSIS deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy water sprout all thy waves and our Billows are gone over me yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayers unto God of my life I say unto God my rock my Revelation why has thou forgotten me and why go I moaning because of the oppression of the enemies let us pray our gracious father we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how this is thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us we have been to ourselves there is nothing we can do other than to praise you okay for all that you do for us every moment of the day every hour of the day Lord you will always keep us Lord you have kept us in the shadows of your wings victory tonight in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated amen we like to entitle this message the greatest of all Treasures the greatest of all Treasures and no doubt it will come to there have come many people to this Revelation without knowing what life is they have spent their lives uh you know gaining material wealthy populations Just Doing Great Things worldly things and every day you hear of some great stars and I often thinks did they know him boy did they come to know life I can't once until that Rebecca because what Satan has done with us third Dimensions he has come to make us think that this life because life was with the original Adam and Eve before they failure we began to experience what we know and when a baby is born the first moment he takes his breath he begins to die right that that's just using new we experience the Pains of death this is trying to cover it what we call life but this is not life hallelujah amen see let's say it like this this only comes to see if you take a seat and you put it in the ground so much once that seed die and rot to itself something takes place scientists don't know how to find zombies but it's in there but the only way that life can produce itself manifests itself that seed has to die and Rise it doesn't stay here it begins to move it is [Music] but that's not what happens to us as human beings [Applause] but the original life then if you if you if you keep yourself if you do not eat of the tree [Applause] you've got to go don't make no difference no one can stop it this is the truth this is what church is about Jesus Christ is about preparing people to live Hallelujah but the world died true life in Jesus Christ amen see we're living in a day where we don't have much time left on according to Genesis 6 this world is repeating itself I mean it's everywhere you know all kinds of uh crazy things are happening to solve the shoes and everything is spinning out of control earthquakes everything falling apart my question is do you know life because what riches will do you particularly think about it all those wealthy people on the Titanic Deuces but their money couldn't save them they were playing all of the rock and roll and whatever jazz music that that boat was going to sing in history they began to sing I played Nearer My God [Applause] don't know who paid the price Hallelujah I did not say no of him I said you've got to know him Hallelujah now you can't tell me there's not a thirst in you everybody want more god dude seeking life they go to this church that saves you to solve her Jesus Christ he's the only one that can he says hallelujah if you get to heaven God is not going to ask you belong to tell you he's going to look for the blood tanks that's the way it was in Egypt he said when I see the blood Hallelujah see this woman at the well so he says she's a prostitute you know I I personally I love this story one of the stories that I love a woman but I was an infamy man I did my dirt yeah and I was just like her I was Ella swear you know what it means to be in bondage is that's the only way you're gonna get out and people think well if I run here and run there it is the part that I like them in the scripture because Jacob today was a well-known man yeah is that right a true servant of the Lord changed to Israel but you see it was a man-made whale and when Jesus came by that lady that the prostitution all that were in Samaria but the whales of all well Hallelujah was talking to her I can give you some water and you'll never thirst again Hallelujah he didn't say sip it he said drinking Hallelujah you know that's what people do this is they come to church and they sip even at least oh it was a good time [Music] no that's not gonna get you anywhere sometimes when I'm real thirsty like this and before I bring it back down it's almost empty yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah and listen when you search for something you don't find it to quench The Thirst Hallelujah according to the dictionary and one of the most powerful and natural appetites the craving for water or other drinks besides its natural significance on the other side is a figurative used of the strong spiritual desires figure being Workaholics [Music] amen amen that's nothing but the truth sometimes we have to mature to understand but that is nothing but the truth why I love this Psalms 42. that has been wounded by a hunter is bleeding and the deer knows that if he doesn't get to water he is more than likely will die so when a deer gets shot or wounded Hallelujah sometimes people try to satisfy we're just going to church we had a good time was more faithful to church and his religious sect is not as a sector who is used then perhaps most of us of all of us and Jesus still told him what you have scripture I'm not going to do you must be born again Hallelujah but the water the low end of the spirit hallelujah amen is that right that was Nicodemus at the top of the line Christians Jesus had something and eat people say all Nicodemus he came back hallelujah amen yes and did you know you know we thought Nicodemus walked away loud everybody want to live nobody wants to die you know talking like this people get all nervous conditions [Applause] a dog or a cat um four for its life oh yeah every area and if they can't fight [Laughter] but everybody wants to live I'll tell you what when we went down to Iowa Ohio excuse me Ohio I really ran to get a little bit of rest my wife we were went to uh Captain D's yeah Captain D's at the restaurant seller store and um we sat down to eat and there's a man in here and two women yeah that's his wife I don't know who the other lady was sat down God in my heart right here you see say you go testify to that man delivered you come on you know I'm like Lord is that you something else I didn't want to get up I mean excuse me he spoke to me and the third time do I know you know me I said you don't know it really I came to testify about Jesus so tell the lady and she said that's my husband he's fighting cancer right now if I pray for him I said don't they say well what what church you go to I said better I don't know God knows I said you gotta believe this is the chance that man believed so much he went to the restroom Hallelujah and when he came back she had a little uh look on his face explain to him I said sure a miracle happens instantaneously three days I may not ever see him again nobody could have done that I ask the Lord for forgiveness because I said that's silver amen hallelujah amen yes we it's so amazing because you know what our sister and I'm not gonna go ahead on with this but I know a sister and she is adamant when it comes to her Christianity she's actually uh people have said that about her and I thought to myself I used to weigh every Christian is supposed to be she's up in the hospital correcting the doctors at the end she says I don't have time to die but faith is what keeps us hallelujah God is good to us see one thing that Jesus said my word is life and that's the problem with most Christians they don't read the word if you read the word you'll find life in it what is life [Music] it's not something you can control as the prophet said tell me what life is and I'll tell you who God is huh T because without what we call life but because he existed is it like this thing what we call Life what he labored it to be it's what he passioned it to be right because he always was he was Elohim except existing ones every time we try to think about that dude because you can't go any further natural mind allows you to go she said Holiness we cannot even explain what it is because God is Holy son [Music] Hallelujah you know it's amazing a lot of people in the understanding they just think that um those uh seraphims and cherubimes they forever that's all they say they ain't got nothing else to say some old people the atmosphere that's was setting the atmosphere they're describing to you the atmosphere Hallelujah they don't know no other thing to say but you think that's all they do you know it's a possibility it's impossible but the point is they're trying to get you to understand it is God and it's going to take us eternity and he gives us the Holy Ghost and we still don't know what it is we just say something got a hold on me huh the Holy Ghost the sentence you say well what it is free he is alive Hallelujah that's why you know working in a system or a way of worship won't give you the Holy Ghost it gives you a [Music] as God that's the way it is Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] I'm sorry I meant to take these old fake things out but anyway I do the best I can listen man we're promised a new new life is promised can you imagine we must look at the day that Adam and Eve was Hallelujah and that blood sacrifice could not be a beast or an animal standing there as a man let me say that again Hallelujah you don't know if you believe on me [Applause] [Music] that woman said from though she was their faith he said give me that water Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying one thing about this water the reason why you don't thirsty he didn't say I'm a glass of water please [Laughter] oh my listen Equity as sure as there is a God in heaven I believe if I live true to him I'll be with all my loved ones for those who have gone on before me that's right so that's really the main thing after all that is [Music] the life will make you there if the Life of Christ is in you it will change oh I gotta do this you know I'm not gonna do this no more of God that's all good to know that your works is like filthy racks is that right when he changes you you don't have to worry about going back to it have you ever seen a tree grow High until it reaches full potential I love that I love that thought you can count the apples in the tree the trees count the trees senior you there's no way you know come on y'all for a Christian to lose you can't lose no matter what you do school lost in Christianity again if I die again well I say die I have any eternal life foreign [Music] foreign in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made this scripture right here this little portion of this is meant so much to me what's life and the life was the light of men when you saw Jesus you saw the way Adams should have lived but he foreign [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah people say well you can make it to heaven did you see that and then he says [Music] Oh Glory to God I love it because the Holy Ghost sentences come to make you like Jesus you better watch that boy let me say it like this Hallelujah if I had a a glass of wine and I had a cup or a bottle and I would take this wine and pour it in that cup what what whatever that bottle of wine was going to do the same thing that cup is going to do is what's in the bottle um Hallelujah almost there Matthew 19. you see I know it's a weekday yeah I'm enjoying this is what it's like the reason why I'm preaching this now should win the economy Falls but if it should fall and you are left with nothing tangible nothing you can put your hands on you better have life you better have it foreign [Music] you know [Music] [Applause] [Music] Matthew 19 16-24. and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good things shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why call it thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments let me tell you something the song If you approach God legalistically legality he will respond in a legal way [Music] searching for some Grace which is also bring Pride people think that they can that their standard of life and Jesus because he asked the question what must I do or what can I do prefer he said unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder thou shall not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness es all these things have I kept my youth foreign go and sell um and give to the poor and thou shall have Treasures in Heaven and follow me we literally call this man to be a preacher because most true preachers they ain't got nothing but with the young man heard that saying well he had great possessions you see what I'm saying he had great possession there's nothing wrong with great possessions does not come first place and God will not take second place to anybody Hallelujah Jesus said unto the disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven this year you know a lot of people in America y'all they still think they poem I've been to Mexico I've been to places where people don't even have clothes on foreign you I oh you know we pile it up and you're not rich yes we got clothes in our closet we had one months the air conditioning right I mean we we got it but that's why it's so hard for Americans because they feel like they don't need a savior oh yeah sir you see a man riding in a Rolls-Royce you know and somebody riding in a Volkswagen The Rose Wallace is going to look down on the Volkswagen um you love the Lord see what happened to the rich that this life would give him everybody in here to recognize God knows the time the clock will tick what is it going to do to have a lavish your life to live such a lavish life because every man that isn't a Christian and everybody know the shame of that right nakedness he thought that the riches of the world would satisfied indeed he was it satisfied until death struck him it is he refused to call an invitation remember the place not the worst in us that's why God can quench he had a thirst people this man had a third if he had no thirst he would not have approached Jesus but when he found out the cause of being a Christian he walked away he looked see there is a following Christopher but I believe with all my heart if the man that only say yes Lord I'll sell all your hair like this God will never do take anything away from you is that right and God will never owe you anything and he said that's all I ask you foreign God is my witness I gave that brother fifty dollars two days later God sent me 500. yeah man I didn't even have to ask for it God will never ask you for something Junior hallelujah amen that little woman that had those few pins okay put those in the place God took her and put her in his Hall of Fame y'all hear what I'm saying really makes you great in the eyes of God whatever you do in secrets you get it that's how you get it someone asked me I heard that question somewhere how do you get rich and God will make sure you become rich that's the truth this good about it I would be nervous about that Eggman I know one thing she's saying truth if the people can really see I got a message in the light of what I saw it the people of God I have one desired this year and that desire to see the Holy Spirit come in this church like he did [Music] you see and believe you me there are people yes who are now choosing the system over to Christ that's what they did which one you want to set free because of Jesus represented the system Hallelujah is that right here my Lord Jesus Hallelujah and yet God had a little church do you have nobody recognized or didn't know that's what we want we want the fire zombies can't nobody Do
