[38:02] open our bibles stand on our feet
[38:05] get right into the word of the lord
[38:08] we'll turn our bibles to first peter
[38:10] chapter five
[38:13] we'll read from the uh
[38:16] the eighth verse
[38:19] i'll speak a message tonight called they
[38:22] that wait upon the lord
[38:25] amen i know our brother preached a
[38:26] similar message recently and i think
[38:28] brother isaiah has touched upon it as
[38:29] well
[38:30] brother isaac and brother isaiah both
[38:34] and uh same time i think we were live
[38:37] streaming from arizona when
[38:39] when i heard our brother isaac preach on
[38:41] this message and
[38:42] and that same scripture from isaiah 40
[38:45] had been on my mind for quite a bit
[38:47] and i heard our brother preach on it and
[38:49] brother isaiah came and touched upon it
[38:51] as well
[38:52] and then my mind that i wanted to preach
[38:54] on it and so the title tonight will be
[38:57] they that wait upon the lord amen but
[39:00] we're going to start from first peter
[39:01] chapter 5
[39:03] the eighth verse it says be sober
[39:07] be vigilant because your adversary the
[39:10] devil
[39:10] as a roaring lion he walketh about
[39:13] seeking whom he may devour
[39:16] whom resists steadfast in the faith
[39:19] knowing that the same afflictions are
[39:21] accomplished in your brethren that are
[39:22] in the world
[39:24] but the god of all grace who has called
[39:26] us unto his eternal glory by christ
[39:28] jesus
[39:29] after that you have suffered for a while
[39:32] make you perfect
[39:33] establish strengthen and settle you
[39:37] amen to be him be glory and dominion
[39:40] forever and ever amen
[39:42] i like that promise even though the
[39:45] enemy is going about
[39:46] be sober be vigilant resist him
[39:49] steadfast why
[39:51] because the same thing is it's not an
[39:52] unusual thing to you amen
[39:54] amen is the same devil he's gone about
[39:56] you seek
[39:58] all your brothers and your sisters amen
[40:00] but the god of all grace is the one
[40:02] that's called of us
[40:03] amen he's gonna after you suffer for a
[40:05] little while he's gonna make you perfect
[40:07] he's gonna establish you he's gonna
[40:08] strengthen you amen he's going to settle
[40:11] you amen
[40:12] now from there let's go to james chapter
[40:14] 4.
[40:17] just back a couple pages james chapter 4
[40:21] verse 1.
[40:23] says from wits come wars and fightings
[40:27] among you

[40:58] give you all the glory and all the honor
[41:00] in it father
[41:01] lord all of us lord we've had our
[41:04] battles throughout the day
[41:05] though we've all had our struggles
[41:07] looked but we've come here at the end of
[41:09] the day lord knowing that
[41:11] that the strength of the lord has given
[41:13] us strength to overcome them all
[41:15] and lord it's upon you that we wait

[41:22] we've done all that we know how to do
[41:23] and after all that we just stand lord
[41:25] waiting upon you

[41:28] that they that wait upon the lord
[41:31] shall renew their strength they shall
[41:33] rise upon their wings like an eagle lord
[41:36] and lord you shall give them strength
[41:38] lord and lord we're trusting in these
[41:40] promises father that we find in your
[41:42] word knowing that they are
[41:43] that there is not like the words of a
[41:46] man that might not have any backing
[41:47] behind him lord but
[41:48] your words have a backing that is as
[41:50] sure as the earth that we're standing
[41:52] upon lord
[41:53] that because you have put that word
[41:55] shallow there they that wait upon the
[41:57] lord
[41:57] they shall renew their strength we are
[42:00] putting all of our trust and all of our
[42:02] hope and all of our strength
[42:03] lord right there in that word shall
[42:05] knowing lord that you will come along
[42:06] after a little while
[42:08] and renew our strength we're trusting it
[42:10] lord we're praying all of our hopes in
[42:12] you father
[42:13] i pray you'll be a blessing to your
[42:14] bride tonight lord as the
[42:16] word goes goes forth in the name of
[42:19] jesus christ we pray
[42:21] amen amen god bless you you can be
[42:24] seated
[42:26] amen be sober be vigilant
[42:30] be careful look out
[42:34] your enemy of the devil he's going
[42:37] around he's
[42:38] looking for a loose spot somewhere
[42:40] anywhere he can find
[42:42] he's been by your house satan's been
[42:45] knocking on your door
[42:47] amen he's looking for a place where he
[42:49] can get in and battle you
[42:51] and the battle is as the prophet said
[42:54] the battle
[42:55] takes place in the mind back there in
[42:58] the garden of eden the
[43:00] the the the avenue of war was chosen
[43:04] the place where the battle for mankind
[43:06] was chosen
[43:07] that that battle would take place
[43:09] throughout from generation to generation
[43:12] that battle would take place in the mind
[43:14] of man
[43:16] and ever since sin that battle has been
[43:19] raging on and on and on and all of us
[43:21] are aware of it
[43:23] there is not one of us that can say that
[43:25] we didn't know that that's where the
[43:26] battle would take place
[43:28] we knew that was where the battle would
[43:30] take place
[43:32] we knew that when we started upon this
[43:34] journey that it wouldn't be an easy
[43:35] journey
[43:36] we knew that things would happen upon
[43:38] this life's journey that we wouldn't
[43:40] enjoy we knew that there would be times
[43:43] that would come upon our life's journey
[43:45] that
[43:45] that we would come to parts of battle so
[43:48] we might not win every battle
[43:50] amen but there would come times where we
[43:52] would stumble and we'd fall
[43:54] things would come and take place that
[43:57] we wouldn't enjoy where we get
[44:01] discouraged and we think lord
[44:03] how is it that you called me to this
[44:06] great
[44:06] high and holy calling and we could just
[44:09] see it so clearly in our mind the the
[44:12] perfectness of the calling
[44:13] the beautifulness the the the how
[44:16] precious it is
[44:17] the the holiest of holies that god has
[44:20] chosen
[44:21] to place inside the heart of man to
[44:24] where you get down into these places in
[44:26] prayer and you
[44:27] you just have these times of prayer
[44:29] where you just all of a sudden the peace
[44:31] that passes all the understanding
[44:33] watches over you
[44:34] and you also you see god high and lifted
[44:37] up
[44:37] and you know that they're that all
[44:39] things are the
[44:40] the god of all power has become your
[44:42] friend
[44:44] as jesus said i i no longer call you
[44:47] servants
[44:49] i've called you friends because a
[44:52] servant doesn't know what his master is
[44:54] doing
[44:55] but uh but our friend tells all amen
[44:58] and god in these last days has called us
[45:01] his friends
[45:02] because he's told us all that he is
[45:04] going to do through this message
[45:06] he has not left himself without a
[45:08] witness in this last day
[45:10] he has sent out the tapes he sent out
[45:12] the prophecies
[45:13] he's shown us what is going to happen in
[45:16] these last days
[45:17] he's called us his friends
[45:20] but for all of that the adversary the
[45:22] devil is still going back
[45:24] going around and the battle is still
[45:26] taking place in your mind
[45:29] amen but yet the saint peter there said
[45:31] there
[45:32] be sober be vigilant
[45:36] look out be watchful
[45:39] the battle is going to take place right
[45:41] there in your mind
[45:42] the enemy is going to come knocking upon
[45:44] your door he's
[45:46] he knows what your secret is he knows
[45:48] like
[45:49] like uh like what uh sam said he said
[45:51] their brother brandon was talking about
[45:52] samson
[45:53] he knows your secret he knows your
[45:56] weaknesses
[45:58] and he knows those are the areas that
[46:00] you have to keep
[46:01] bathed in prayer brother branham said
[46:04] because
[46:05] brother brad says satan has that one
[46:07] punch coming
[46:09] he's got a right to that one place
[46:12] he's got a right to come and punch you
[46:14] in that one place and it's coming
[46:17] it's a weak spot it's something there
[46:19] that he said and brother bran says
[46:21] you have to keep those areas bathed in
[46:24] prayer
[46:26] why because satan's coming and the
[46:29] battle is going to come
[46:31] it's not going to be easy but that's why
[46:34] god chose you
[46:37] but that's why god chose you because he
[46:41] chose a bride that
[46:42] that when the battle got hot and heavy
[46:46] that that that that bride would know how
[46:49] to come to him in prayer
[46:51] that bride would be one that would wait
[46:54] upon the lord
[46:56] because those that wait upon the lord
[46:58] they're the ones that are going to renew
[47:00] their strengths
[47:01] oh there's going to be many that the
[47:02] battle is going to come and they're not
[47:04] going to wait upon the lord
[47:05] there's going to be many that they're
[47:06] going to trust in their own strengths
[47:08] they're going to trust in their own
[47:10] dogma they're going to trust in their
[47:12] own religion
[47:13] they're going to trust in some moving of
[47:15] the spirit that came upon their flesh
[47:17] or some feeling or something else but
[47:20] there is a but there's going to be a
[47:21] bride
[47:22] that she is going to wait upon the lord
[47:25] she knows the secret of the lord jesus
[47:28] christ
[47:29] she knows the secret place why because
[47:31] she's met him on the backside of the
[47:33] desert
[47:33] she's met him in the prayer closet she
[47:36] knows who he
[47:37] is amen why because they've become
[47:39] friends
[47:41] i don't call you servants anymore i call
[47:44] you
[47:44] friends because i've shown you
[47:46] everything that's coming
[47:48] i i've given you the revelation through
[47:50] the tapes as you've listened to the
[47:52] message of the prophet
[47:53] as you've listened have you gone through
[47:54] the bible amen you've gone through all
[47:56] these things
[47:57] you've meditated upon the word of the
[47:59] lord and the revelation of the gospel of
[48:01] jesus christ has come upon you
[48:03] and when i saw that and when god saw
[48:05] that revelation
[48:06] open it up in your mind he says that's
[48:08] it i have called you my friend
[48:10] i've called you my bride and as you are
[48:13] waiting upon the lord all of a sudden
[48:14] here comes the strength of the lord
[48:16] amen you begin to rise up upon the wings
[48:18] of the eagle
[48:20] why because they that waited upon the
[48:22] lord
[48:24] they shall renew their strength i like
[48:27] that word shell
[48:30] that word shallow means a lot to me
[48:33] because if he said they that wait upon
[48:35] the lord might renew their strengths
[48:38] it just wouldn't have had the same
[48:39] promise to it
[48:42] but he says those that wait upon the
[48:44] lord shall
[48:46] you know i i i've had quite i've had a
[48:48] rough time these past few months
[48:51] just going through some own things in my
[48:52] own personal life
[48:54] and i've been beaten down i've gotten a
[48:57] little weak
[48:58] you know and i and as i've gotten a
[49:00] little weak i've turned
[49:02] my face towards the scriptures and i've
[49:05] turned my face towards this scripture it
[49:07] says
[49:08] they that wait upon the lord they shall
[49:12] praise god i needed that and i've been
[49:16] and oh i say for the last four or five
[49:18] months or so i've been taking that
[49:20] scripture to the lord in prayer
[49:22] i said lord you promised
[49:25] you said lord you said i would renew my
[49:28] strength
[49:29] you know what that means to me that
[49:32] there's a renewal coming
[49:35] i've placed that upon the altar of the
[49:38] lord
[49:38] where the blood of the lamb is where
[49:41] where
[49:42] where christ entered into the holiest of
[49:45] holies one time
[49:46] amen with his own blood to make
[49:49] intercession for us based upon our
[49:51] confession
[49:52] and i have confessed that i shall renew
[49:54] my strength
[49:55] because i have waited upon him amen even
[49:58] though my adversary
[49:59] he's going around like a roaring lion
[50:01] he's poking
[50:02] he's prodding he's trying to weaken us
[50:05] he's trying to do this he's trying to do
[50:06] this but yet
[50:07] i shall renew my strengths that word
[50:11] shell means
[50:11] everything to me because i know that the
[50:15] the renewal is coming oh i've had a
[50:18] battle
[50:19] we've all had a battle we've had a hard
[50:21] time coming
[50:22] we've had things that have come but they
[50:25] that wait upon the lord they shall renew
[50:27] their strength
[50:30] amen i was reading in the the book of
[50:33] daniel
[50:36] and i love the book of daniel
[50:40] if you could ever just one time put
[50:42] yourself in daniel's shoes
[50:46] because you know many of the prophets
[50:48] they grew up in a time where the temple
[50:50] was there
[50:52] and all those things but daniel grew up
[50:54] in a time where he was
[50:56] 500 miles away from the promised land
[50:59] growing up there and uh as a young man
[51:02] in babylon
[51:04] and hearing uh all the you know
[51:07] knowing where they had come from
[51:10] knowing the worship of the lord in the
[51:12] temple
[51:13] and knowing the promises of the lord in
[51:16] the promised land
[51:17] and yet for all that he's he's going to
[51:20] bed every night hearing the worship of
[51:22] the some foreign god off coming through
[51:25] the sounds of his window
[51:27] you know and hearing the bloodthirsty
[51:29] religion of the babylon
[51:31] babylonians and growing up surrounded by
[51:35] just
[51:36] all the foolishness of babylon and
[51:39] thinking lord i don't belong here
[51:42] you called me to a promised land
[51:46] you you called me to to to a place where
[51:49] i could bring my sacrifice to the
[51:51] temple door you called me to a place
[51:54] where i could
[51:54] bring my tithes into the into the holy
[51:58] place
[51:58] to that place where the pillar of fire
[52:00] came down over the holies of holies
[52:03] but lord what am i doing here in this
[52:05] babylonian system
[52:07] what am i doing here in this land where
[52:10] all these foreign gods are worshipped
[52:12] that
[52:12] that have no no no
[52:16] don't even exist all these false
[52:19] gods it reminds me of
[52:23] i hear people talking about sports and
[52:25] the super bowl and all these things and
[52:27] and they worship this and they worship
[52:29] that and
[52:30] and all the vulgarities you hear day in
[52:32] and day out and
[52:34] it just seems like you can't hardly find
[52:36] anybody that has the same vision that
[52:38] you do
[52:40] they see sports and the almighty dollar
[52:43] and
[52:43] i see angels and thrones and a heavenly
[52:46] kingdom
[52:50] it's like nobody's on the same page
[52:53] they don't seed eye to eye with us
[52:57] we've separated ourselves we've we've
[52:59] tried to keep ourselves clean from the
[53:01] world and we've
[53:03] we have a a heavenly vision we know that
[53:06] we didn't belong here like this cold
[53:08] weather that we've been having
[53:10] that they didn't have that cold weather
[53:12] in the garden of eden
[53:14] there's something in our flesh that
[53:15] cries out it's not supposed to be like
[53:17] this
[53:18] every time our we see with our minds
[53:20] something whether it be
[53:21] sinful or or of this fallen world and we
[53:24] think
[53:25] it's not supposed to be that way and
[53:28] that's the way that daniel the prophet
[53:29] daniel was he was
[53:31] there living in babylon all those year
[53:33] after year after year thinking it's not
[53:35] supposed to be this way
[53:37] it's not supposed to be this way god
[53:40] gave us a promised land amen
[53:45] hey i just want to turn over to uh i
[53:47] think it's daniel chapter 12.
[53:50] let's see if i can find it real quick
[53:55] one thing daniel had is he had access
[53:58] to the writings of jeremiah
[54:08] yeah daniel chapter 9 verse verse 2.
[54:15] i don't know where he had access to
[54:18] these scrolls
[54:22] or how he got hold of him
[54:25] but as he was reading the scroll of the
[54:28] prophet jeremiah
[54:30] he began to see something
[54:34] amen our revelation began to strike
[54:36] forth
[54:40] in daniel chapter 9 verse 2
[54:44] it says in the first year of his reign
[54:47] talking about darius king of babylon
[54:49] king of the persians
[54:52] in the first year of his reign i daniel
[54:56] i understood by books the number of the
[54:59] years where the word of the lord came to
[55:01] jeremiah the prophet
[55:03] that he had accomplished 70 years in the
[55:06] desolations of
[55:07] jerusalem and i set my
[55:10] face unto the lord
[55:13] to seek by prayer and supplications with
[55:17] fasting
[55:18] and sackcloth and ashes
[55:22] and i pray unto the lord and i made my
[55:24] confession
[55:25] i like that amen he made his confession
[55:30] there's something about revelation
[55:31] sometimes that drives you
[55:33] to confession amen you know when you
[55:37] he he he is reading there in the scroll
[55:39] and he began to understand that they
[55:40] were only supposed to be there
[55:41] 70 years and he and he began to
[55:45] count off the years of the reigns of
[55:48] each king and how long they'd been there
[55:49] and he's
[55:51] beginning to get to the realization
[55:54] that's been
[55:54] 69 70 years
[55:58] whatever it was at that time and he
[56:01] begins to look he's like oh my
[56:04] it's time for us to go back
[56:08] amen and when that revelation began to
[56:12] strike him
[56:13] that the 70 years were up the prophet
[56:17] jeremiah prophesied and says you're
[56:19] going down to jerusalem
[56:21] and you're going to be there for 70
[56:23] years
[56:25] and now here daniel is reading the
[56:27] writings of jeremiah who's been dead and
[56:29] gone
[56:30] all these years and he's counting off
[56:32] the years and beginning to realize that
[56:34] it's time for the prophecies to be
[56:36] fulfilled amen
[56:38] and when that realization began to
[56:40] struck him
[56:41] look what his response was and so i got
[56:44] down on my knees
[56:46] and i began confessing i began crying
[56:49] out
[56:50] i began praying amen
[56:53] and it goes on down there and i'm not
[56:55] going to read this whole prayer but i
[56:57] want you to
[56:58] look over here at uh
[57:01] i think it's verse 18.
[57:11] just i just wanted to kind of give you a
[57:14] uh
[57:15] a glimpse of what his prayer was like in
[57:17] verse 18 it says
[57:19] oh my god incline thine ear and hear
[57:23] open thy eyes and behold our desolations
[57:26] and the city which is called by thy name
[57:28] for we do not present our supplication
[57:30] before thee for our righteousness
[57:33] but for thy great mercies all the
[57:36] promises that god had given to the
[57:38] promised land was lying and waste
[57:40] jerusalem was lying as a burning heat
[57:43] they weren't fulfilling the promise of
[57:45] god for their day
[57:46] amen and these men he was beginning to
[57:48] time it's time for them to fulfill the
[57:50] promise
[57:51] and so he began to cry out and
[57:53] confessing and he says lord we're not
[57:55] caught they're not crying out lord
[57:56] because of our own righteousness
[57:59] we don't have any and so lord we're
[58:03] crying out for your great mercies
[58:06] we see what the promise says lord but
[58:08] when we look at our own flesh
[58:10] lord how can we do it we see what we
[58:14] what the promise of the hour says we
[58:16] should be but when we look down in our
[58:18] own selves lord
[58:20] lord how can we fulfill it amen
[58:25] he says in verse 9 oh lord hear
[58:28] o lord forgive o lord hearken
[58:32] and do defer not for thine own sake oh
[58:35] my god
[58:36] for thy city for thy people are called
[58:39] by thy name
[58:40] and he says while i was speaking
[58:45] and praying and confessing my sin
[58:49] and the sin of my people israel and i
[58:52] was presenting my supplication before
[58:54] the lord my god
[58:55] for the holy mountain of my god yes
[58:58] while i was speaking in prayer even the
[59:01] man gabriel who i'd seen in the vision
[59:03] at the beginning
[59:05] being caused to fly swiftly he touched
[59:07] me
[59:09] my while he was praying
[59:13] while he was presenting while he was
[59:15] supplicated while he was
[59:17] bringing out his sins laying upon the
[59:19] altar
[59:20] crying out lord not my righteousness
[59:22] lord but lord i'm crying out for your
[59:24] mercies lord
[59:25] lord i see what the promise of the hour
[59:27] is lord but lord how can i fulfill it
[59:31] it's at that time
[59:33] that all of a sudden he was touched by
[59:35] an angel
[59:38] look what he says there in verse 23 what
[59:41] uh
[59:42] uh what then well you remember the angel
[59:44] says there in verse 22
[59:49] sorry reading verse 23 he says the angel
[59:52] says to him
[59:53] at the very beginning at the beginning
[59:56] of thy supplications
[59:57] that commandment came forth
[1:00:01] look over at the look over at the next
[1:00:03] chapter of chapter 10 verse 12.
[1:00:06] and he said and he said unto me the
[1:00:08] angels still speaking to him
[1:00:10] fear not for from the first day that
[1:00:13] thou did set thy heart to understand
[1:00:16] and to chasten thyself before thy god
[1:00:19] thy words were heard and i am come for
[1:00:22] thy words
[1:00:26] the first day when you began to cry out
[1:00:28] to the lord
[1:00:31] well the first time you began to confess
[1:00:34] when you began to present
[1:00:35] when you began to lay your sins upon the
[1:00:37] altar when you began to
[1:00:39] catch the revelation of where we ought
[1:00:41] to be in this day
[1:00:42] where are we out to the children where
[1:00:44] the bride of christ ought to be in this
[1:00:45] day
[1:00:46] and when you begin to realize your
[1:00:47] shortcomings when you begin to cry out
[1:00:50] and
[1:00:50] and say lord i'm not rising up to the
[1:00:54] to the message of the hour i'm not in
[1:00:56] condition lord to
[1:00:57] to meet the promise of the hour lord
[1:00:59] when you begin to cry out for your
[1:01:01] shortcomings
[1:01:02] the very first day i heard your prayer
[1:01:07] and they that wait upon the lord they
[1:01:10] shall receive a time of renewing they
[1:01:13] shall renew their strength
[1:01:15] it's a promise it's got to happen
[1:01:18] it's got to happen oh we've had many
[1:01:21] mighty battles
[1:01:23] but let me tell you he's called us
[1:01:24] friends because he has
[1:01:27] shown us everything that he's going to
[1:01:28] do
[1:01:30] the seals have been ripped off the
[1:01:33] message has been given
[1:01:35] the book of revelation has been laid
[1:01:36] wide open we know that what we are
[1:01:39] waiting for
[1:01:40] we know that we're waiting for the
[1:01:41] rapture of the bride we know that we are
[1:01:44] that the the bride is going to make
[1:01:46] herself ready
[1:01:47] but if there is a promise of a bride
[1:01:49] making herself ready
[1:01:50] then there's got to be an ability given
[1:01:53] to the bride to make herself ready
[1:01:55] and that ability comes laying on your
[1:01:57] knees
[1:01:58] laying down your prayer amen is seeking
[1:02:01] the lord
[1:02:02] and he will send that renewal lord
[1:02:05] in our bride's revival amen amen it's
[1:02:09] been promised
[1:02:10] it's going to happen they that wait upon
[1:02:12] the lord they shall renew their strength
[1:02:15] it's been promised it's got to happen
[1:02:18] amen amen
[1:02:26] one thing i like about daniel when you
[1:02:29] read daniel chapter one
[1:02:32] it talks about the three young hebrew
[1:02:34] boys
[1:02:36] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:02:39] and daniel himself and the four of them
[1:02:43] said that when they were chosen to
[1:02:46] present themselves to the king of
[1:02:48] babylon
[1:02:51] that they had to spend so much time
[1:02:55] being purified
[1:02:59] kind of like esther was they had to be
[1:03:02] purified before they went into the court
[1:03:04] of the king
[1:03:06] and so the the eunuch there he
[1:03:09] or the the the i forget what title he
[1:03:13] exactly
[1:03:13] had the man that was charged over them
[1:03:17] he he came to him and he put them in a
[1:03:20] special place there and he says i
[1:03:22] you're going to eat this special diet
[1:03:24] from the king of babylon
[1:03:27] and this special diet once you eat it
[1:03:30] after so long then you will
[1:03:32] then you will uh be ready and prepared
[1:03:35] to go in and
[1:03:36] and give service unto the king of
[1:03:38] babylon the king of persia
[1:03:43] and so when they began to look at the
[1:03:45] menu
[1:03:46] of the diet of the king of babylon
[1:03:51] and all of a sudden their heart said no
[1:03:53] no no no
[1:03:55] i can't eat this
[1:03:59] and they began to read the menu of all
[1:04:01] these things
[1:04:02] and their mind went back to the things
[1:04:05] that they've been taught as a child that
[1:04:07] thou shall not eat this thou shall not
[1:04:11] eat this
[1:04:13] to give honor unto the lord jehovah keep
[1:04:16] yourself clean from this
[1:04:18] keep yourself clean from that and when
[1:04:21] they
[1:04:22] went to go give service to the king of
[1:04:24] babylon they
[1:04:28] they went and they told the man that
[1:04:30] charged over and says we can't eat that
[1:04:34] and the man says you have to
[1:04:38] you have to partake of this if you don't
[1:04:41] partake of this what am i going to do
[1:04:43] when you present yourself to the king
[1:04:46] what am i going to do when you present
[1:04:48] yourself to the king and your
[1:04:49] and your faces are falling and you look
[1:04:51] weak and you're
[1:04:52] not eating from the king's table
[1:04:55] and they said we have a king that is
[1:04:57] greater than this king
[1:04:58] amen and he has given us a diet that is
[1:05:02] greater than your diet
[1:05:04] and it is to that king that we are going
[1:05:06] to serve as to that diet to the king
[1:05:09] jehovah
[1:05:10] that is the diet that we are going to
[1:05:12] eat of and there is nothing you can do
[1:05:14] to cause us to eat the diet of the king
[1:05:17] of babylon
[1:05:20] and it caused the man that charged over
[1:05:23] a lot of grief and he says what am i
[1:05:24] going to do i will be
[1:05:26] the king will have me killed if i try to
[1:05:28] present you
[1:05:29] to the king of babylon and he finds you
[1:05:31] weak and you haven't been eating from
[1:05:33] his table
[1:05:34] and so daniel and his wisdom he said try
[1:05:38] us
[1:05:40] let us eat from the from the diet of of
[1:05:43] the king jehovah
[1:05:44] amen of the god of jehovah that we serve
[1:05:48] let us try jehovah's diet for a little
[1:05:51] while amen
[1:05:52] just let us try jehovah's diet for these
[1:05:55] 10 days or whatever it was
[1:05:58] and then come and look at our faces and
[1:06:00] see if our faces are not brighter
[1:06:02] see if they don't shine see if we don't
[1:06:05] walk with a little bit upright step
[1:06:07] see if we don't walk with a little bit
[1:06:08] more confidence a little bit where we
[1:06:10] know where we're going
[1:06:14] and the king of babylon
[1:06:17] servant looked at him and says okay
[1:06:19] we'll try it
[1:06:22] and he didn't withhold anything from he
[1:06:23] said whatever it is whatever it is that
[1:06:26] jehovah said you shall eat
[1:06:28] i will give it to you you eat that and
[1:06:30] then after 10 days i'm gonna come back
[1:06:32] and i'm gonna give out the inspection
[1:06:35] and i'm gonna look and i'm gonna see
[1:06:37] what it what the what the what the the
[1:06:39] evidence
[1:06:40] or what the uh what the
[1:06:45] what the cause of this diet what the
[1:06:46] effect of this diet on your body will be
[1:06:50] as the ten days went on
[1:06:54] they faithfully ate the diet of jehovah
[1:06:57] for ten days
[1:06:59] and after 10 days the king of babylon's
[1:07:01] servant came up and looked at him and
[1:07:04] oh my they were walking their shoulders
[1:07:07] were
[1:07:07] rolled back there walking with a spring
[1:07:10] in their step in there
[1:07:12] their faces were shining and clean and
[1:07:15] and he said oh my
[1:07:17] this diet from this jehovah is all
[1:07:20] together a hundred times
[1:07:21] better than the king of babylon
[1:07:27] and so he allowed them to eat
[1:07:31] not from the king of babylon's table
[1:07:35] but from jehovah's table
[1:07:38] and we're living in a babylonian day
[1:07:42] mystery babylon is everywhere
[1:07:46] brother bran said don't you fear the
[1:07:49] iron curtain
[1:07:53] or the bamboo curtain or any of the
[1:07:56] curtains
[1:07:59] he says you fear that purple curtain
[1:08:03] you know there's so many things going on
[1:08:06] you say well i'm in the message
[1:08:09] but you know lukewarmness can get us
[1:08:11] tentacles around all over the place
[1:08:14] and none of us are immune to the the
[1:08:17] effects of the antichrist in this day
[1:08:20] amen you know you remember the story
[1:08:22] where brother brannon was walking
[1:08:24] through the woods one day and he was
[1:08:26] trying to cross a crick and he saw this
[1:08:29] looked like a sturdy log laying there
[1:08:31] and he
[1:08:31] grown across the creek and he went to go
[1:08:34] step on it and
[1:08:36] the rotten with the the log was rotten
[1:08:38] on the inside
[1:08:40] and he he thought it could hold him as
[1:08:42] soon as he put his weight on it it just
[1:08:44] crumbled under his feet and he began to
[1:08:47] fall down and he
[1:08:48] and he jumped back to the shore and he's
[1:08:50] like
[1:08:52] my look at this lock
[1:08:56] laying in the fountains of living water
[1:09:01] caused it to rot twice as quick
[1:09:04] and many people they'll sit on the
[1:09:07] church pews
[1:09:09] and they'll they'll rot twice as quick
[1:09:12] as someone out in the world there why
[1:09:15] because when they began to
[1:09:16] to to leave the table leave the diet of
[1:09:20] jehovah behind
[1:09:22] of prayer of dedication to the word of
[1:09:25] god
[1:09:27] of giving preeminence to lord jesus
[1:09:29] christ
[1:09:30] when they begin to no longer worship the
[1:09:33] lord jesus
[1:09:34] christ they they come to church and they
[1:09:36] got other things on their mind and they
[1:09:38] and they no longer have time in the
[1:09:39] morning to read their bibles
[1:09:41] they no longer have time in the mornings
[1:09:43] to to to to
[1:09:44] to to bow down in prayer they've left
[1:09:47] the diet of jehovah behind
[1:09:50] and now is coming the time not to
[1:09:51] present yourself to the
[1:09:53] king of babylon but the time is coming
[1:09:55] where we're going to present
[1:09:56] ourselves to the lord jesus christ and
[1:09:59] there's going to come a time in a moment
[1:10:01] in a twinkling of an
[1:10:02] eye the trumpet's gonna sound amen and
[1:10:05] then those that are ready are gonna go
[1:10:08] into a wedding feast
[1:10:10] and we're gonna the time is gonna prove
[1:10:12] who was waiting upon the lord
[1:10:16] and who had their strength renewed
[1:10:19] whose face was going to begin to shine
[1:10:22] whose shoulders are rolled back
[1:10:24] who's walking in faith why because they
[1:10:28] that wait upon the lord that
[1:10:30] even though the the enemy is going to
[1:10:32] come like a roaring lion he's going to
[1:10:34] poke you he's going to project he's
[1:10:36] going to
[1:10:36] try to knock you down to the ground but
[1:10:39] those that wait upon the lord
[1:10:41] they shall renew their strengths it's
[1:10:43] got to happen
[1:10:44] because it's been prophesied in isaiah
[1:10:47] 40 that it will happen
[1:10:48] amen and there's got to be somebody
[1:10:52] that's going to show up in the last days
[1:10:55] with their
[1:10:56] strength renewed flying like an eagle
[1:11:00] because it's been prophesied that it's
[1:11:02] going to happen but it's only going to
[1:11:04] happen to those
[1:11:05] that have looked at the diet of babylon
[1:11:08] and says i don't want to eat that
[1:11:10] amen looked at all these foolish
[1:11:13] movies and hollywood and all this
[1:11:15] different stuff and i don't want to
[1:11:16] partake of that
[1:11:18] i don't want to feed myself with all
[1:11:19] that instead they get ourselves down on
[1:11:22] their knees in prayer
[1:11:24] they open up their bible and they read
[1:11:26] their bible and they meditate upon the
[1:11:28] lord god their lord
[1:11:29] savior jesus christ because he has
[1:11:31] become their friend
[1:11:34] and he will reveal unto them the things
[1:11:36] that are going to take place
[1:11:39] amen
[1:11:44] amen daniel he began to realize that he
[1:11:47] was living in the last days of
[1:11:49] jeremiah's prophecy
[1:11:51] he's like oh lord forgive me lord i
[1:11:54] i know what the promise is but lord i'm
[1:11:56] falling short of what the promise is
[1:11:58] i want to keep myself clean i'm trying
[1:12:00] to keep myself pure
[1:12:02] lord you're you're you're the jerusalem
[1:12:04] is in ruins
[1:12:06] all of our people we're sitting here in
[1:12:08] babylon and we ought to be living in
[1:12:10] your land of all where all your promises
[1:12:12] are
[1:12:13] lord forgive us lord wash us bring us
[1:12:16] back to your promises
[1:12:18] because he was realizing that it was the
[1:12:20] time of the end
[1:12:22] amen and you know we're not in the end
[1:12:24] of 70 days but we're in the end of 70
[1:12:26] times seven amen
[1:12:28] we're at the end of seven church ages
[1:12:30] and there ought to be somebody that's
[1:12:31] going to look at the promises of the
[1:12:33] gospel
[1:12:34] uh promises of a of a bride that has a
[1:12:37] lamp that's been trimmed
[1:12:39] that is brining the the shining brightly
[1:12:42] and she's gonna and she has been charged
[1:12:45] to shine light
[1:12:46] all the way from here to the wedding the
[1:12:49] wise virgins were given a duty to to
[1:12:53] well all 10 of them were all the wise
[1:12:55] and the foolish were both given a charge
[1:12:57] they were given a lamp and they are told
[1:13:00] use this lamp to shine the light from
[1:13:02] here to the wedding
[1:13:04] but when the call came out
[1:13:07] the foolish their light wouldn't shine
[1:13:09] anymore
[1:13:11] it's not they didn't have a lamp they
[1:13:14] had lamps
[1:13:15] they just wouldn't shine for and thy
[1:13:18] word o lord is a lamp unto my feet
[1:13:20] and a light into my path and everybody's
[1:13:23] got the gospel it's laying on a
[1:13:25] bookshelf in a thousand every household
[1:13:26] in america practically
[1:13:28] but who can get it to work who knows the
[1:13:30] author of it
[1:13:32] who's opening it up who's meditating on
[1:13:34] meditating on
[1:13:35] who is eating from this book amen that
[1:13:38] they can
[1:13:40] have themselves renewed amen amen
[1:13:44] who can testify i am the one that is
[1:13:47] rising up and
[1:13:49] riding on the winds like an eagle
[1:13:51] there's got to be somebody that's
[1:13:53] fulfilling this
[1:13:54] amen in the last days there's going to
[1:13:56] be somebody that is renewing their
[1:13:58] strengths
[1:13:59] who is it going to be it's got to be the
[1:14:01] bride of christ
[1:14:02] amen there's a prophecy laying there and
[1:14:04] woe unto us
[1:14:05] if we are not the ones fulfilling the
[1:14:07] prophecy amen so we ought to lay these
[1:14:10] this this diet this babylonian diet down
[1:14:13] and take the diet of jehovah of prayer
[1:14:17] of meditation of the promises of god
[1:14:20] amen amen why because they that
[1:14:23] have the prayer closet they that wait
[1:14:26] upon the lord
[1:14:27] they shall renew their strength
[1:14:30] amen
[1:14:34] i preached a while back a message called
[1:14:38] god's response to the cries of bondage
[1:14:42] and we took from it
[1:14:46] the children of israel after
[1:14:49] the forefathers died after abraham isaac
[1:14:52] and jacob
[1:14:52] and joseph all of them passed away they
[1:14:58] began to live there in egypt and goshen
[1:15:02] but after a while they began to be put
[1:15:04] into more and more bondage
[1:15:06] amen and as the
[1:15:10] bondage increased more and more and more
[1:15:12] that they
[1:15:13] got to a place that they just couldn't
[1:15:16] put up with it anymore
[1:15:19] and they began to cry unto the lord
[1:15:22] but you know the thing of it is is when
[1:15:24] god's people cry out to the lord it
[1:15:26] seems like they always cry out for a
[1:15:28] partial deliverance
[1:15:31] you know god's people when they cry out
[1:15:33] for deliverance they always seem to want
[1:15:35] just a partial deliverance
[1:15:38] they just want to be restored back to
[1:15:40] goshen or something
[1:15:42] lord just take us back to gosh and let
[1:15:44] us live in peace
[1:15:45] but you know god doesn't provide a
[1:15:47] partial deliverance
[1:15:49] if god is ever once gonna hear you
[1:15:53] if you get down on your knees and you
[1:15:56] begin like daniel presenting your prayer
[1:15:59] and you're getting along and crying out
[1:16:01] for the situations that you've got
[1:16:03] yourself into
[1:16:04] when you begin confessing all of your
[1:16:06] the times you've eaten of that
[1:16:08] babylonian diet
[1:16:09] now you try to give up some of that well
[1:16:11] i want to give up this part over here
[1:16:12] but i still want to partake of this
[1:16:14] i still want to partake of that lord i
[1:16:16] want to give this up but i don't think
[1:16:18] i'm ready to give this up yet
[1:16:20] you know when you begin crying out to
[1:16:21] the lord you know god doesn't provide a
[1:16:23] partial deliverance
[1:16:26] and so when you get god's attention
[1:16:29] and he looks at you crying out there for
[1:16:31] that partial deliverance
[1:16:34] that's not what he's going to send you
[1:16:37] no he sent them a moses
[1:16:38] that's right and moses wasn't interested
[1:16:41] in impartial deliverance
[1:16:43] no no he wasn't interested in just
[1:16:45] restoring them back to goshen
[1:16:47] or just give them peace in egypt so that
[1:16:49] they could enjoy their leaks and their
[1:16:51] onions and all the the delicacies of
[1:16:53] egypt
[1:16:54] oh no no he yanked them out of there he
[1:16:56] took them to a promised land
[1:17:04] they cry out for a partial deliverance
[1:17:06] which god does not provide
[1:17:09] amen so when we get out on our knees and
[1:17:12] we begin crying
[1:17:14] it may not be easy because god has an
[1:17:17] interest
[1:17:18] in bringing you to a total deliverance
[1:17:23] that everything would fall away you know
[1:17:26] when we come down and we come down to it
[1:17:28] and we get in those places like daniel
[1:17:30] was
[1:17:31] and we realize that the rapture is
[1:17:33] coming soon and we
[1:17:34] look at the condition of our lives and
[1:17:36] realize that we're not
[1:17:38] matching the need of the hour and we get
[1:17:40] on our knees and start praying
[1:17:42] god's intention is that you would come
[1:17:44] to a total and complete deliverance
[1:17:49] so we have come to the place where
[1:17:51] daniel stood there lord
[1:17:53] we're not coming to rely on our own
[1:17:55] righteousness lord
[1:17:57] but we're coming for our mercy lord
[1:17:59] we're just laying it down all upon the
[1:18:01] altar
[1:18:03] and i'm going to partake this daniel
[1:18:05] diet once more
[1:18:06] this diet of jehovah the diet of purity
[1:18:11] gospel purity amen a thinking man's
[1:18:15] filter
[1:18:17] amen lord i'm going to go partake of
[1:18:20] this once more lord
[1:18:22] and and then the bible says there in
[1:18:24] daniel that the very first
[1:18:26] day that he started crying amen god
[1:18:28] started listening
[1:18:30] amen we ought to put faith in our prayer
[1:18:32] that god as we are speaking
[1:18:34] as we are praying as we are confessing
[1:18:37] as we are presenting
[1:18:38] as daniel said there all those things to
[1:18:41] the lord
[1:18:42] that he is listening every bit and he
[1:18:44] has a walk for you to walk amen
[1:18:46] and it's but it's a walk of the bride of
[1:18:49] the lord jesus christ
[1:18:51] he says that the wise virgin rose up
[1:18:55] when the cry went out and she
[1:19:00] began to clean her lamp began to trim
[1:19:04] the wick
[1:19:05] she realized it was running a little low
[1:19:07] in oil but it's okay because
[1:19:10] she had another source of oil she knew
[1:19:12] where to go
[1:19:14] to refill her oil and that's what the
[1:19:16] wise virgin has in this last day
[1:19:19] that the foolish version doesn't is she
[1:19:22] knows how to get her oil refilled
[1:19:24] hey man so when the when the enemy comes
[1:19:27] like a roaring lion and he begins to
[1:19:30] feel like he's stealing your oil
[1:19:34] wait upon the lord you shall renew your
[1:19:36] strength
[1:19:38] the wise virgin's duty was to shine the
[1:19:41] light all the way to the wedding
[1:19:43] the gospel has to be working for you the
[1:19:46] word has to be alive in your life
[1:19:49] it's got to be a living word a living
[1:19:50] gospel then it's the lord jesus christ
[1:19:53] you gotta ought to have the testimony of
[1:19:56] what is god is doing for you now
[1:19:58] amen when you look on your life and you
[1:20:01] realize that all your testimonies are
[1:20:02] getting old
[1:20:04] you know you if you were to go and
[1:20:06] witness to someone all your testimonies
[1:20:07] are from two years ago
[1:20:09] three years ago four years ago five
[1:20:10] years ago and you can't testify anything
[1:20:12] that god is doing for you today
[1:20:16] wait upon the lord he'll renew your
[1:20:20] strength
[1:20:21] so you can testify that god has restored
[1:20:24] me
[1:20:25] and placed me upon the strong rock by
[1:20:27] his side amen
[1:20:28] let's just stand
[1:20:37] we read there in james 4.
[1:20:42] he said where are all these wars and
[1:20:44] fightings cut from among you where do
[1:20:46] they come from
[1:20:49] he says don't they come from the lusts
[1:20:51] that wore on the inside of you
[1:20:54] and we see people that are fighting and
[1:20:56] fussing and there's
[1:20:57] i see all the evidence of outside
[1:21:01] battles because there's a battle on the
[1:21:04] inside
[1:21:06] amen and when the battle comes to the
[1:21:09] inside
[1:21:11] it's because back in the garden of eden
[1:21:16] says that's where the battleground was
[1:21:18] chosen
[1:21:19] the battleground would be in mine
[1:21:26] but they that wait upon the lord the
[1:21:29] battle gets hot and heavy
[1:21:31] they shall remain
[1:21:34] and there will be a people in the last
[1:21:37] days
[1:21:39] whose strength will be renewed it's been
[1:21:42] prophesied
[1:21:44] they shall that's why you put the word
[1:21:48] shallow in there they shall
[1:21:52] rise up like nothing can keep an eagle
[1:21:56] down
[1:21:59] like a temporary storm might push it
[1:22:02] from heaven's heights as the song goes
[1:22:05] but that storm will pass it's got to
[1:22:08] pass
[1:22:10] because they that wait upon the lord
[1:22:12] shall renew their strength
[1:22:15] be brought back to the garden of eden
[1:22:18] like the fall never took place
[1:22:19] never even took place it's a promise
[1:22:22] that's been given to us
[1:22:24] so be sober be vigilant
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:29] maybe let's just bow our heads and word
[1:22:30] of prayer heavenly father
[1:22:35] we just right now in the name of the
[1:22:36] lord jesus christ
[1:22:39] like daniel in the book
[1:22:43] chapter 12
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:46] threw his windows open
[1:22:50] he'd been reading the prophet that went
[1:22:54] before him
[1:22:56] he began to realize he was living
[1:23:00] not just in the last days last minutes
[1:23:02] last
[1:23:04] hour
[1:23:07] he realized that he still had something
[1:23:08] to do
[1:23:12] now
[1:23:15] so he began presenting his supplication
[1:23:20] being praying and speaking confessing
[1:23:23] presenting his prayers before the lord
[1:23:28] and god gave the response and said as
[1:23:30] soon as you started praying all of
[1:23:32] heaven
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:44] that overcoming power is on its way
[1:23:49] it might be might be fought
[1:23:52] and delayed a little bit here and there
[1:23:53] by the enemy
[1:23:55] but it shall come this is the prophet
[1:23:59] the bride of christ will be standing in
