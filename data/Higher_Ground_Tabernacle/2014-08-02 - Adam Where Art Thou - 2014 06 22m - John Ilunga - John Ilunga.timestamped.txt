[11:41] you theam that I'm talking about
[11:45] now it's not the was
[11:51] in I'm want to make you travel through
[11:55] the thoughts so that we understand why
[11:58] God called you this morning
[12:02] when God called you to this message in
[12:05] this hand
[12:08] time the belie the Believers of this
[12:11] word in this
[12:18] time the thought of God in this same
[12:21] time is to see Adam back to the way he
[12:25] the way he was
[12:35] God wants wants to see Adam get back
[12:38] what he lost at the beginning and that
[12:41] has to happen in the Believers of this

[12:55] whatever was given to hadam that time is
[12:58] given back to him in this
[13:04] time I want us to see who was hadam and
[13:08] what was given to hadam by that
[13:12] time before I go into the deepest of
[13:16] this
[13:21] message I want to make you I want to let
[13:24] you see why God uh lead me to this
[13:27] message
[13:37] I'm trying to see like uh the the
[13:40] conscience that God wants you to see
[13:43] it's like it's kind of fed
[13:53] away God when God called you you are
[13:57] seated here you've got a great miss that
[13:59] God gave
[14:03] you it's like you don't see exactly that
[14:07] responsibility that you've been
[14:11] given I saw some good
[14:14] preaching through three weeks ago was
[14:18] preached
[14:20] here brother in the corner
[14:25] there God uses him I don't know if he
[14:29] noticed that but God uses him in special
[14:35] way he came here with the message which
[14:39] makes my heart start
[14:44] beating he said it's the time for you to
[14:47] be put in your in your place in your
[14:50] right
[14:54] right the spirit of adoption that has to
[14:57] come right
[15:06] after God bring again another preacher
[15:10] here and he seated right
[15:13] there I was trying to look around and
[15:16] see where he is and he's
[15:19] right so I was I I was I was I I was
[15:23] listening to
[15:24] him he came here quite slow
[15:29] he came with the with the problem of ano
[15:34] anointing he went slow
[15:37] slow but the OS did not go
[15:43] further but I don't know if he really
[15:46] listened to what the spirit was telling
[15:49] it was a a greatest message that I I I
[15:51] listen to that after
[15:54] him I saw somebody
[15:57] else I was listening
[16:00] what is the spirit trying to speak and
[16:02] he said
[16:05] now is the time that we got the right to
[16:08] eat
[16:10] the our right to eat those
[16:13] M that message
[16:16] was because
[16:18] there's hidden
[16:21] man that is not for
[16:27] everybody that is reserved for those uh
[16:31] uh the the the priest oh those for the
[16:35] priest that is reserved for the priest
[16:38] that are being
[16:44] anointed those those those priests they
[16:46] have to eat those maners in a in a holy
[16:52] place now what am I observing my sisters
[16:55] brother
[17:01] you might see God do something for you
[17:03] but you don't understand what is going
[17:09] on we are in the AG where our brother
[17:12] Bram said God God is is badly is badly
[17:21] heard it's like people they don't
[17:24] understand really what God is really
[17:26] trying to do
[17:32] it's like he said we are in the Hedge
[17:35] where God is trying to move every gift
[17:38] that he has to make people understand
[17:40] but people is like they are looking in
[17:41] the
[17:45] v those message they they had something
[17:49] that God brought to
[17:53] us and this morning I just came to get
[17:56] those message and try to make it
[18:01] clear Isaiah
[18:06] said God your God anointed
[18:10] you he anointed you with the anointment
[18:13] of
[18:19] Joy those anointment it put you above
[18:23] all the all your colleagues
[18:31] now
[18:32] listen listen to this word oh God your
[18:36] God anointed you which God
[18:41] again God anointed another
[18:46] God he said that's why he said oh God
[18:50] your God anointed
[18:54] you now you are seated here you don't
[18:57] know if you don't know whether you God
[18:59] or
[19:00] not now I want to tell you this
[19:04] morning God who
[19:08] people he calling you
[19:11] God now put you in the position of
[19:15] God he anointed you with an special
[19:21] ano those anointment come upon you
[19:29] above all the above all your all the all
[19:32] the positions of this
[19:34] world it's the anointment of
[19:38] Joy it's not anointment of
[19:41] suff it's not anointment

[20:21] Authority this
[20:24] world if if God anointed you it's not

[20:51] me what what spirit is
[20:55] etal that eternal spirit
[21:00] that eternal spirit
[21:04] anointed that anointment is nothing else
[21:06] but the eternal
[21:09] spirit God in form
[21:12] of desend
[21:14] upon human and that
[21:19] human anointed by God heaven and you are
[21:23] not the same as
[21:25] everybody from this morning
[21:28] from this
[21:30] morning I want to walk like God on this
[21:35] earth when God created the first man
[21:38] this world his name
[21:40] wasen now look at what God
[21:43] did it was the first
[21:45] time when
[21:48] God anointment
[21:50] and and put
[21:53] upon now you can see
[21:58] was anointed with nothing else but the
[22:01] anointment of
[22:02] God
[22:05] now now for
[22:09] God he needed
[22:14] to Adam spes
[22:18] to
[22:20] obey he can he can speak something and
[22:24] that thing
[22:26] happens when God created
[22:31] you cannot give you cannot give me the
[22:34] spiritual
[22:36] di when God called lion is
[22:40] lion when God called
[22:44] leard now in things
[22:48] of it's God of this Earth Adam who gave
[22:52] the
[22:57] names God
[23:01] amen was part to God in in
[23:15] Divine God
[23:18] God his part in Divinity andem also at
[23:22] his own part in Divinity so those
[23:25] divinity when we put them together it
[23:27] makes the whole divinity
[23:37] through so he created H he created hadam
[23:41] ham had his had Divinity in him that led
[23:46] him to name the to name everything he
[23:48] said this is a man this is a leopard
[23:51] this is lion and that was Divinity which
[23:54] was connected connected to God himself
[24:01] when God created the first man at the
[24:09] beginning the
[24:15] message fundamental of the fath of the
[24:18] faith okay okay and he
[24:22] said when God created the first man
[24:28] created him above everything on this
[24:33] Earth gave him the jurisdiction of this
[24:38] Earth he gave him the authority of
[24:43] everything he
[24:45] control he
[24:47] control he control the
[24:50] fish he he control the ha and the Wis
[25:03] that's where the spirit want us to
[25:12] be anointed you and they restore you
[25:15] like
[25:17] head you are you are above everything on
[25:21] this
[25:24] Earth you see look he said he he can he
[25:28] control
[25:33] everything created a he was he was
[25:36] created a God on this
[25:42] Earth he was given the power to control
[25:47] everything he was controlling even the
[25:50] stuff of this
[25:55] world God give had given
[25:58] a big uh big Authority not small
[26:02] Authority but big
[26:07] Authority he had even the authority to
[26:09] make
[26:13] choices when God created him he was he
[26:16] was superficial
[26:35] you see brother say when you see these
[26:38] people out there
[26:41] uh we call them like Sinners they can do
[26:44] whatever they want you see they can even
[26:47] go further with sciences and trying to
[26:49] make some create make something create
[26:52] something out of nothing what made them
[26:55] to do that is the same Authority see
[26:58] that was given by God unto them like
[27:02] Gods so they had that ability to create
[27:04] something and that was coming from
[27:10] God now look at everything was
[27:16] obeying even every nature was obeying
[27:19] the was
[27:20] obeying the human when you a man fall
[27:24] down
[27:28] that he has he had on
[27:33] this he became unconscious of
[27:40] reality the sin
[27:43] that made it make him become unconscious
[27:47] of the authority that he was
[27:52] given he did not have that reality again
[27:56] in his life
[28:00] the relation the relationship between
[28:03] him and God was was no more
[28:09] [Applause]
[28:13] there the the communion which was
[28:16] between Adam and God because Adam could
[28:18] talk and God answer him back now today
[28:21] you can see there even believers who
[28:23] does not know does not know that God
[28:26] answers m
[28:36] now brother say today if you are a
[28:39] Believer who does who does not speak to
[28:42] God and let God answer you back don't
[28:44] call yourself a
[28:51] Believer lost that communion between him
[28:54] and God
[29:03] those those let me say those word ways
[29:08] which was in Adam the ways in which Adam
[29:11] could talk to God and God answer him
[29:13] back those ways were are
[29:17] closed now look at that situation and
[29:20] that state of
[29:30] what was Adam in God at the
[29:35] beginning God sent Jesus to come and die
[29:38] on the
[29:44] cross for Jesus has to become a redeemer
[29:49] who has to die and redeem
[29:57] us now look at this all look at these
[30:00] churches in the world all the churches
[30:02] they worship
[30:04] Jesus Jes because
[30:08] Jesus in our
[30:16] places Jesus died because he want to
[30:20] redeem us and return us back to the
[30:23] position the position of Adam in the in
[30:25] the garden of
[30:28] no there's two things
[30:32] in the first thing is Jesus was supposed
[30:35] to
[30:37] pay the price of
[30:44] sins now the second thing is Jesus has
[30:48] to take us back to the position where we
[30:50] are supposed to
[30:58] [Music]
[31:02] now when now I come back to the message
[31:05] which brother spoke last time he wanted
[31:08] to speak about the inheritance and he
[31:11] spokes about inheritance about his
[31:23] mother the price of those uh those the
[31:27] price of those things things is
[31:28] something else now getting those things
[31:31] now to possess those things is something
[31:34] else
[31:36] again his parent bought those things and
[31:42] pay for him to go and get those
[31:46] things Jesus already paid the price
[31:58] cry is about to go and get those things
[32:06] and the resurrection of Jesus Christ is
[32:09] something that you have to
[32:16] share Jesus died because that anointment
[32:19] which was on him has to
[32:22] come let me tell you good
[32:25] news since the beginning
[32:36] since the Genesis until today today when
[32:39] God now is getting
[32:42] those to

[32:52] world because Adam was God on this
[32:58] he lost those
[33:02] author now those Authority went back to
[33:08] God in order to wait for the men who are
[33:12] supposed to get it back

[33:18] old those titles were not given
[33:21] given Jesus came and
[33:25] died those title were not given
[33:37] given back

[1:18:57] H paragraph
[1:19:00] 70 I beginning
[1:19:05] from if
[1:19:07] there's germination of Life natural
[1:19:14] life and having life
[1:19:19] inside you're going to see that life is
[1:19:22] going to trans transmit itself from from
[1:19:25] father to a
[1:19:29] son I want to go straight the point if
[1:19:33] you you have the germination
[1:19:36] of which was in
[1:19:40] Christ you must see the trans
[1:19:44] transmission the
[1:19:47] transmission that
[1:19:50] was into you
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] what what we are seeing here it means
[1:19:57] had germination from my
[1:20:01] father that that that life has
[1:20:06] transmitted so that I may be seen
[1:20:11] like if you are a chosen one you must
[1:20:15] have that
[1:20:17] germination etal
[1:20:21] germination that you have has to be
[1:20:24] something that
[1:20:29] the same our our Natural
[1:20:36] Life there some there some way where our
[1:20:40] life is is
[1:20:42] trans that came out of our
[1:20:46] fathers and that was transm through our
[1:20:49] Natural Life
[1:20:55] the same way for the spirit of
[1:20:58] God in in his in his
[1:21:05] fullness
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:11] come it has come to an elevated
[1:21:18] point when he manifested in a body
[1:21:20] called Jesus
[1:21:24] through that body God paid the the price
[1:21:28] of my
[1:21:30] sins and I was in
[1:21:34] him when Jesus
[1:21:37] died the chosen one were inside
[1:21:41] Jesus when he rose
[1:21:46] again when he again and I
[1:21:49] was him when he rose again
[1:21:54] now realize how the resurrection
[1:21:59] came there was a body on the cross of
[1:22:10] Calvary inside that body there was a a
[1:22:13] soul and that Soul move out of that body
[1:22:17] and enter into the
[1:22:22] called that is the
[1:22:26] it went into the
[1:22:30] H I may try to have some image like

[1:34:01] scripture confirmation and the
[1:34:07] evidence
[1:34:09] 4 I'm I'm going to tell you one one
[1:34:13] before I read it when I was in Africa
[1:34:17] God told
[1:34:20] me I I haven't I haven't called you so
[1:34:24] that you mixed up with the other what
[1:34:26] other people
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:30] doing a lot of churches that I saw that
[1:34:38] country he has a church but he's
[1:34:40] fighting with the other Pastor in that
[1:34:42] church that other Pastor he has a church
[1:34:45] but he's fighting with other Pastor in
[1:34:46] that other church that's the thing I
[1:34:50] saw and God told me don't enter those
[1:34:54] kind of
[1:34:55] thing
[1:34:59] now
[1:35:01] I looking looking for for the
[1:35:06] of I want to know what position should I
[1:35:10] have in in
[1:35:11] God
[1:35:14] now now there was something that God
[1:35:16] told
[1:35:19] me I had some ministers and preachers
[1:35:23] who were
[1:35:24] gu how to pray how to look for the of
[1:35:27] God how to listen to the the voice of
[1:35:31] spirit now God told
[1:35:35] us I I don't want you to enter into the
[1:35:38] destruction of this church and the
[1:35:42] religion this time here is time of
[1:35:45] adoption of
[1:35:47] sons now what I want to do on this
[1:35:51] Earth those people who are in
[1:35:55] those who are who is
[1:35:59] mine I'm going to put something in his
[1:36:03] life which is going to confirm
[1:36:07] my be
[1:36:11] the
[1:36:14] son you are not going to
[1:36:21] see there some people there there
[1:36:29] says I'm going
[1:36:32] to
[1:36:34] are and that has to happen in adoptions
[1:36:37] of the son that's what I'm talking about
[1:36:39] listen to me
[1:36:47] now it has to come
[1:36:54] personal experience God that is to be
[1:36:58] confirmed to you that is the evidence
[1:37:00] for
[1:37:10] you there is only one thing which put
[1:37:13] the
[1:37:18] difference nothing like
[1:37:25] you you hiding religion without
[1:37:28] anointing they they hide without
[1:37:33] God you must have personal confirmation
[1:37:37] that your don't sit there you don't
[1:37:41] believe
[1:37:42] that you don't use
[1:37:44] anything and the demon
