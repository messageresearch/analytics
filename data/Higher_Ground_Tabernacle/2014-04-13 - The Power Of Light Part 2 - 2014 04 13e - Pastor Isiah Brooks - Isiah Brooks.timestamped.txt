[1:41] she was determined so as you can see by
[1:44] the grace of God they were
[1:47] deter you know the Lord is good to us
[1:51] and as we were speaking on this
[1:53] morning uh dealing with the uh Power of
[1:59] light
[2:00] and showing you by the grace of God uh
[2:03] what we we are now working with we are
[2:05] God's creation we are creation amen and
[2:08] we're created after his likeness we are
[2:12] children of the light is that right
[2:14] that's exactly what the Bible calls us
[2:16] Children of the light and if we are
[2:19] children of the light that that means
[2:21] that we are light if our father is light
[2:23] that's who we are brother Brandon
[2:26] basically said that we were a rotation
[2:28] off of God amen that is whatever God is
[2:31] we're just a piece I mean they they used
[2:34] to say a chip off the old block but God
[2:36] doesn't grow old but we are chip off the
[2:38] block amen so we appreciate God for
[2:41] being so real To Us by the grace of God
[2:46] so let us turn I'm sorry I stand and
[2:49] turn to Isaiah 21 and 12 amen because I
[2:54] believe right now we are in h a place
[2:57] where we're getting ready to see the day
[3:00] break ah I'm so happy about it I don't
[3:03] know what to do now if I was looking at
[3:05] my flesh if I was looking at my Cosmos I
[3:08] would be scared to death especially if I
[3:12] thought God was going to judge me
[3:14] accordingly but God is looking at the
[3:16] inner man right it's like the butterfly
[3:20] he he leaves the out outward shell on
[3:23] the on the on wherever is hanging right
[3:26] and God has formed a new body a new
[3:29] something that he wraps himself into and
[3:31] so when he comes out he leaves a shell
[3:34] of cocoon there now I don't know what's
[3:37] going to be left here when we translated
[3:40] amen but whatever it is I'm sure I won't
[3:43] need it Over Yonder amen neither will
[3:46] you amen so by the grace of God let's
[3:50] turn to Isaiah
[3:52] 21 and by the grace of God we want to uh
[3:56] uh uh move forward uh we realize by the
[4:00] grace of God there is is so much amen
[4:03] that God is trying to uh get us to
[4:07] understand uh by the word of God and and
[4:11] and and I'm so happy happy happy about
[4:15] it amen so it says we we we talked about
[4:20] um the the coming of the night we talked
[4:22] about uh the The Watchman and and one
[4:26] thing about a Watchman he has to be in a
[4:28] position where he can can see the enemy
[4:30] approaching he can also see the breaking
[4:33] of the day uh way before others who are
[4:37] perhaps on a on on a on a different
[4:39] level I'm not the Watchman he's the
[4:42] Watchman and uh because of his watching
[4:45] uh we know what's happening amen so here
[4:48] it says the burden of Duma he's called
[4:50] to me out of seier Watchman what of the
[4:55] night Watchman what of the night the The
[4:59] Watchman said the morning cometh and
[5:03] also the night if you will re inquire
[5:08] inquire ye
[5:11] return
[5:13] come ain't God good amen so let us pray
[5:17] Heavenly Father God we come before you
[5:19] we thank you for the grace of God and
[5:22] Lord we appreciate everything that you
[5:24] have said and done Lord we just pray
[5:27] Hallelujah that you will anoint this
[5:29] service even as you did this morning we
[5:32] pray that you break and destroy the
[5:34] yolks of the enemy Lord we realize Lord
[5:37] we it's later than we think uh and
[5:39] father we we just love you here tonight
[5:42] we bind every Spirit of confusion
[5:44] everything that will uh exalt itself
[5:47] against you Lord and your word we bring
[5:50] it down underneath our feet Lord
[5:53] hallelujah every dark Spirit everything
[5:56] that is contrary we pray that your light
[5:59] will destroy uh it in the name of Jesus
[6:03] Lord we thank you right now for your
[6:04] grace and Your Love We Appreciate You
[6:07] Lord Jesus in Jesus Christ's name we
[6:09] pray amen you may be
[6:12] seated and we showed you amen that it is
[6:15] darkest before Dawn so therefore there
[6:19] is a battle going on and we show uh this
[6:22] morning how that this is why your mind
[6:25] battles have been so
[6:27] intensified amen because realize the
[6:30] world they don't know that the Battle
[6:33] Ground is in the mind there is no battle
[6:36] for them amen because amen whatever
[6:39] Satan uh basically inspired them to do
[6:43] it is what they do but you and I have a
[6:46] secret we have a mystery that has been
[6:48] unfolded unto us and that is this battle
[6:52] that we're not fighting is in our mind
[6:55] the reason why one of the reasons why is
[6:58] because amen it is where your thought
[7:01] process is is that right amen and the
[7:04] Bible says as a man thinketh so is he as
[7:09] a man thinketh in his heart so is he so
[7:13] we're realizing here this this evening
[7:16] amen if Satan can get you to think less
[7:19] of yourself he can slow you down he can
[7:23] never stop you but he can hinder you he
[7:27] can actually put uh things uh in your
[7:30] way but as I say he can never stop you
[7:34] the reason being is because God said in
[7:37] his word that all things work together
[7:40] for the good of them that love God
[7:46] Amen even our failures God will work it
[7:50] that's our light that's our Revelation
[7:53] amen we are
[7:54] victorious because God Even in our own
[7:57] failures we working out toward our good
[8:01] you say give me an example
[8:03] Samson right amen Samson was put on
[8:07] Earth Amen to conquer the Philistines
[8:10] and he messed up horribly is that right
[8:14] but God took his
[8:16] mistakes and made him triumphant uh come
[8:20] on somebody it this his mistakes brought
[8:23] him to his death but it also brought him
[8:26] to his victory amen matter of fact amen
[8:30] he he he was like placed in the Hall of
[8:33] Fame right amen even at a time when it
[8:37] appeared to his enemy that he
[8:40] failed he literally died with his enemy
[8:44] there was no story to tell afterwards
[8:47] there was no way that Samson could speak
[8:49] for himself amen hallelujah amen and no
[8:53] doubt amen even in among the the the
[8:55] Israelites he may have looked like a
[8:57] failure Amen in the natural your eye but
[9:00] in God's eye he accomplished his purpose
[9:04] on Earth amen see and that's what you
[9:07] and I must realize the light that God
[9:09] shows us the word can never come back
[9:13] void think about it look at the chaos
[9:16] that we're now living in because of Adam
[9:19] and Eve's
[9:20] sin but God took the very thing that was
[9:23] working against Adam and turned it
[9:25] around for the good because God's desire
[9:29] was that it would to be it was to be a
[9:32] contrast and without that mistake
[9:35] without that that thing that Adam and
[9:37] Eve uh did do god could have never shown
[9:41] himself like he's showing himself to us
[9:43] right nowl so listen God will always
[9:47] work your take the very mistakes that
[9:50] you make and work it toward your good so
[9:54] much so there won't be one person in the
[9:58] judgment who can accuse you of anything
[10:02] is that the word according to Isaiah the
[10:05] Bible said who's listen listen the Bible
[10:07] said no weapon formed against you shall
[10:10] prosper and those who come Amen to judge
[10:13] you amen will be silenced amen because
[10:17] they'll realize who you are amen oh
[10:20] Hallelujah think about it God showed
[10:23] that even through Abraham when Abraham
[10:25] made such a mistake amen God told that
[10:28] King you go ask as Abraham to pray for
[10:30] you amen right see he's always and it
[10:34] was a mistake but go look what happened
[10:36] in Abraham's mistake when he made the
[10:39] mistake he left out of that country a
[10:41] richer
[10:43] man hallelujah amen he had more Goods
[10:47] more
[10:48] everything see what I'm saying so God
[10:51] will I don't want you to take this
[10:53] lightly I just want you to understand
[10:55] the Revelation the light of this message
[10:58] is who can lay in charge that God's
[11:01] elect it is God who have chosen us it a
[11:03] God who have elected us and it is God
[11:06] who gives us the victory amen now
[11:10] Watchman what do you see we looking at
[11:12] this thing by the grace of God we
[11:14] understand there's earthquakes happening
[11:16] every day right but we realize by the
[11:19] revelation of this message California is
[11:22] going to sink he didn't tell us exactly
[11:24] what time but we see this thing moving
[11:27] in position amen even the world know
[11:31] after New Zealand and all the others
[11:33] amen who've had these big earthquakes
[11:35] Japan now listen science didn't know
[11:38] nothing about the ring of fire until the
[11:40] prophet of God spoke
[11:42] it that term came after he had spoken
[11:46] about the ring of fire now come on
[11:48] somebody now I want you to realize it's
[11:51] the truth now I want you to realize by
[11:53] the grace of God also scientists didn't
[11:56] even know brother bam had always taught
[11:58] a man that that that a man thinketh in
[12:00] his heart it was then science who came
[12:03] after us who said amen that there's a
[12:06] place in man's heart where he thinks
[12:08] amen well the word of God had already
[12:10] said it amen right now you look at this
[12:15] and you said well brother what are you
[12:16] saying when brother Brandon was in
[12:18] California he said oh Los Angeles Los
[12:21] Angeles capernium capernium God would
[12:24] but you would not now he did not even
[12:27] remember that that's right amen he
[12:30] didn't remember saying it he had to go
[12:32] back and listen to the tapes but what
[12:35] was it it was God speaking to his bride
[12:38] he was revealing unto her what he was
[12:41] about to do to
[12:43] Sodom come on somebody so you and I must
[12:47] realize that the word of God Amen is
[12:50] light to us it goes before us amen it
[12:54] shows us the future amen ah it it
[12:58] reveals to us what we should do what we
[13:00] should not do how to walk where to walk
[13:03] and where to stay out from Lord now it
[13:07] it it just it's powerful amen so we see
[13:11] how the world is quaking tsunamis right
[13:14] diseases I was showing my wife at the
[13:16] restaurant all of the uh how can I say
[13:19] it all of the uh mutations that have
[13:23] taken place over in Japan because of
[13:26] that uh uh leakage uh of from the atomic
[13:30] the nuclear place I mean butterflies
[13:33] children uh uh uh animals uh you name it
[13:37] some with two heads and faces all marred
[13:41] and all kinds of grotesque things now
[13:45] think about it amen that was not God's
[13:48] doing that was man's doing amen right
[13:53] and you know if they had not that there
[13:56] amen if the the earthquake if it would
[13:58] have taken place none of the mutations
[14:01] would have taken place but you see how
[14:04] God protects us and he warns us now we
[14:08] we know that even in this last day
[14:10] brother brandham talked to to us and he
[14:12] talks about the Hideous sites now I had
[14:15] no idea what he meant by hideous I I I
[14:17] didn't know it I didn't even know he was
[14:19] talking about people but when you see
[14:21] people amen with all of the tattoos and
[14:24] all of the figuring and the way they're
[14:26] cutting their hair the way they
[14:27] fashioning themselves it's literally
[14:29] it's
[14:30] hideous because we can see not to
[14:33] criticize I'm not criticizing because
[14:36] when I see people like that I think oh
[14:38] my God if I could reach up I know
[14:40] they're thirsting for something and they
[14:42] want somebody's
[14:44] attention you see and you look at that
[14:47] and you think to yourself that could
[14:48] have easily been me
[14:51] amen right but we are living in a time
[14:54] where wrong is right and right is
[14:57] wrong it's true everything is blending
[15:00] in and bleeding in and whatever more and
[15:02] now there is so much Darkness to the
[15:06] light seems to be out of
[15:12] place I had the
[15:15] scripture uh uh uh but I think I'm going
[15:18] to have you turn to it in just a
[15:21] moment now let let me move on the way
[15:23] let me move the way he wants me to now
[15:26] this is a breaking of day and we shows
[15:29] you by the grace of God as the darkness
[15:31] comes and presses it's the light that's
[15:35] literally forcing it
[15:37] together it's the light that's forcing
[15:41] it together and these this darkness is
[15:43] coming together as a strength to put out
[15:46] the light but there is no way you know
[15:50] Satan doesn't even learn even after
[15:52] thousand years of Millennium you know
[15:55] when God raise everything up Satan tries
[15:58] to conquer God again amen if he
[16:01] understood the
[16:03] law of God's Own Universe he realize
[16:07] that there is no way that Darkness can
[16:10] comprehend light I'm going show you that
[16:12] in just a
[16:14] moment we looking at this and I want you
[16:17] to understand that this light is in in
[16:20] uh uh Supreme
[16:23] control amen God don't need a secretary
[16:26] to keep up with his
[16:27] paperwork God God has it all under
[16:30] control he knows exactly where
[16:33] everything is right now is that all
[16:37] right now we look at this thing and we
[16:40] said I told you I said it's always a
[16:42] wrestling it's always a battle before
[16:45] the break of day Jacob had the wrestle
[16:48] who was a type and Shadow of what who
[16:50] the bride is that all right I said
[16:53] Jericho had the russle in that sense
[16:56] listen it was no easy task for them to
[16:58] walk around the city of Jericho with
[17:00] their mouths shut and not say anything
[17:03] can you imagine walking for miles and
[17:05] not being able to utter a word I don't
[17:07] think we could do it but by the grace of
[17:10] God that was what they had to suffer and
[17:13] they did it and God rewarded them
[17:16] amen but the greatest thing and I said
[17:19] earlier this morning when I think about
[17:21] the darkness that Jesus Christ
[17:26] conquered not only did he conquer on
[17:28] Earth
[17:29] Earth because the moment he said it was
[17:32] finished Satan had lost the battle yes
[17:35] sir amen and he conquered Satan in the
[17:40] cosmos is that right Amen brother B said
[17:43] when he went to Calvary he didn't have
[17:46] one he said God has separated
[17:49] himself when he was in Gethsemane he was
[17:53] crying unto the Lord the Bible said an
[17:55] angel came and strengthened him amen but
[17:58] he God moved out of the way and he went
[18:01] to Calvary as a man see if he had gone
[18:05] as God he would have there was there was
[18:07] no no no effort would have been made but
[18:10] he had to go as a man as a sheep before
[18:14] his shears dumb not saying a mumbl word
[18:19] hallelujah he didn't want to give away
[18:20] the secret Hallelujah he had to keep his
[18:23] mouth shut and the Bible tells us amen
[18:26] that when he got to a place that only
[18:29] one time he basically said anything
[18:32] toward God he said my God my God why H
[18:36] has thou forsaken me and he had to say
[18:39] that because he was locked into the
[18:40] scripture yes sir because it was written
[18:43] because it was prophesied in the Psalms
[18:46] that he had to this is what he would say
[18:48] David wrote as if it was him Hallelujah
[18:51] but what it was it was a God that was in
[18:54] David amen was that was foretelling the
[18:57] future oh I love that because if God
[19:01] foretold it and it happened exactly like
[19:04] he said what about this
[19:08] translation Hallelujah There Is No Death
[19:12] there is no no nothing that the sting of
[19:15] death can do to keep you from reaching
[19:18] the goal amen
[19:21] wo he paid the price amen hallelujah he
[19:25] paid the price amen the who the light of
[19:28] of the world Jesus said I'm the light
[19:31] I'm the Revelation I am your salvation
[19:34] if you want to live believeth th on me
[19:38] he said if you believe out of me out of
[19:39] your belly shall flow rivers of Living
[19:43] Waters why because only the true
[19:46] children of God can
[19:49] believe see amen you said what brother I
[19:52] believe I really do believe maybe I
[19:53] can't do it listen ain't nobody in here
[19:56] will be exactly like Jesus he was a man
[19:59] without sin and the only reason why we
[20:02] are without sin because we got him in US
[20:04] amen amen hallelujah God ain't looking
[20:08] at your flesh if he had looked at your
[20:10] flesh we all be in hell right now
[20:13] Hallelujah but God is looking at the
[20:15] inner man the man that's on the inside
[20:17] of you Hallelujah
[20:20] Hallelujah Jesus he conquered listen
[20:23] what he did every demon in hell he
[20:27] conquered yes sir you said how how did
[20:30] he did he fight every one of them he
[20:32] didn't have to fight everybody he fought
[20:34] one that was no real fight brother brand
[20:38] said he opened the door the devil opened
[20:39] the door said I got you now amen he said
[20:42] Jesus
[20:44] Took grabbed the keys slapped him
[20:46] knocked him a little bit kicked him back
[20:48] inside amen that was no real battle now
[20:52] Satan was a prisoner of his own
[20:55] prison huh come on somebody he's locked
[20:58] in into his own
[21:00] pit cuz Jesus Christ have the keys of
[21:03] death hell and the grave come on
[21:05] somebody amen but we look at this thing
[21:07] amen and he when he conquered the
[21:10] leader the most powerful demon or devil
[21:13] in hell was Lucifer himself he conquered
[21:16] it therefore he conquered death Hell In
[21:19] The Grave with one shot one blow
[21:22] Hallelujah he conquered it all oh come
[21:25] on somebody I'm talking about your daddy
[21:28] amen I'm talking about your father I'm
[21:30] talking about your creator I'm talking
[21:33] about your savior your deliverer he
[21:35] whooped the devil in his own territory
[21:39] for you and I we don't have to worry
[21:42] about
[21:43] it as brother brandom said it like this
[21:46] he said the
[21:49] shadow of death he said you can't have a
[21:52] shadow unless there is some light he
[21:56] said but you don't have to be afraid of
[21:58] The Shadow Shadow because the shadow
[21:59] never hurt
[22:01] anybody come on somebody the shadow
[22:04] never hurt and what is it he said
[22:06] basically death amen is your buggy it's
[22:10] your chariot it is the thing that you

[22:16] death oh he must be
[22:18] humiliated when he have to ride you or
[22:20] take you amen up instead of
[22:23] down hallelujah amen you he must be
[22:27] humiliated just as humiliated as Lucifer
[22:31] was when he looked for Moses's body
[22:35] amen hallelujah the devil amen is put to
[22:38] shame and that's what the Bible said God
[22:41] brought him to a open
[22:44] shame all those years amen he made
[22:48] people think amen that he was the power
[22:51] he was the source of life amen and we
[22:55] find out amen now he's just a toothless
[22:57] lion
[22:59] still
[23:01] lying hallelujah amen you said what
[23:04] brother Brooks amen he seemed powerful

[23:39] light lest his deeds should be
[23:44] reproved see so you wouldn't have come
[23:47] to the light if you hated
[23:50] it why because no man
[23:53] amen no evil person wants to be
[23:57] uncovered he wants to remain evil you
[24:00] wouldn't even come to church if you
[24:01] hated the light because many times while
[24:04] we're at church that a evil is uncovered
[24:10] amen when Satan is hiding only the word
[24:13] knows where to
[24:15] strike and we come back for more amen it
[24:19] shows by the grace of God that you're
[24:22] Children of the light and not of the day
[24:26] and we want to be just like our father
[24:28] one of these old days we'll say there is
[24:30] no darkness in
[24:34] me Hallelujah ain't God good to us amen
[24:39] we're Children of the light according to
[24:41] St Luke 16 and8 amen turn with me to
[24:44] Matthew
[24:45] 5:116 I hope this is okay because we got
[24:49] to realize amen who we are it's powerful
[24:52] who God what we're being transformed I
[24:54] was telling the brother I said if there
[24:56] is such thing as a evolution we are now
[24:59] evolving into God
[25:01] amen hallelujah we're not evolving into
[25:05] what what Obama said they they might be
[25:07] evolving into that kind of stuff but we
[25:09] are evolving if there be if there's such
[25:12] thing as
[25:16] Evolution amen what is God doing
[25:19] creating a higher
[25:20] order is that right he is creating a
[25:24] higher order right in Satan's Eden where
[25:27] did he create Adam in his own Eden but
[25:30] now he's creating a greater than Adam
[25:33] yes sir is that right the Bride of Jesus
[25:37] Christ is a quickening spirit amen but
[25:40] where is the quickening spirit being
[25:42] created right in the belly of
[25:46] hell you don't believe you're
[25:49] there brother bam said those two men two
[25:52] Dimension hell and Earth is blending in
[25:54] together amen and when the Lord
[25:57] descended in 19 63 where did he go not
[25:59] just the Earth he went right there on
[26:02] the land and the Sea and say time w't be
[26:04] no more what was he doing those two
[26:06] Dimension would he had to come right
[26:08] back to
[26:11] Hell the darkest place ever come on
[26:14] somebody and you cannot tell me without
[26:18] this message before you really was
[26:19] converted you were living in hell and
[26:22] you didn't even know it you said well
[26:24] what do you mean you weren't in
[26:26] heaven you not in
[26:30] heaven your representation was but you
[26:32] weren't there yet until you were
[26:37] quickon y'all hear what I'm saying cuz
[26:39] brother brandom said how whatever you
[26:41] doing on Earth is where you doing
[26:43] wherever right if you doing Wicked on
[26:45] Earth you can't be in heaven wickedly
[26:47] doing
[26:49] it come on somebody y'all getting quiet
[26:52] but we'll move on anyway we look at this
[26:54] thing because I want you to understand
[26:56] that this light this Revelation as said
[26:58] to you early this morning just acts 238
[27:01] is going to be a challenge for you not
[27:04] just believing in a
[27:05] prophet there are a lot of people
[27:07] believing in prophets that are join in
[27:09] with the E communal
[27:11] counsel but they're still
[27:16] trinitarians and then they will attack
[27:18] you you mean to tell me that God is one
[27:21] you know why the devil hates that
[27:23] because that trinitarian Doctrine comes
[27:25] straight from hell it also comes right
[27:28] from baalism and as long as you
[27:30] worshiping God in the Trinity you're not
[27:32] worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ the
[27:35] Bible said one time God winked at
[27:37] ignorance he don't wink in no more right
[27:40] he's now judging it why because the
[27:42] truth of the word has
[27:46] come that old that old that Old liing
[27:49] Demon brother B said the worst thing the
[27:52] church could have ever allowed Satan to
[27:55] do amen is to make the Holy Ghost speak
[27:58] in tongues as the
[27:59] evidence he said that's the worst thing
[28:01] they could have ever done because that
[28:03] in itself brought in the E communal as
[28:07] long as I speak in tongues and you
[28:08] believe that's the Holy Ghost then I can
[28:10] speak in tongues and you got to accept
[28:12] me as your
[28:15] brother you got to accept me as if I'm
[28:17] Catholic and worshiping Mary but I'm
[28:20] speaking in tongues I got the Holy Ghost
[28:22] so I'm baptized in the body you got to
[28:24] accept me what a lie from hell
[28:29] Hallelujah even though the Holy Ghost
[28:31] speak in tongues it ain't the tongues
[28:34] it's the
[28:35] life Hallelujah so many people amen is
[28:41] not in
[28:42] heaven because they believe that
[28:44] Doctrine and they were just so surprised
[28:48] hello somebody thank God for a prophet
[28:51] thank God for the light of the word
[28:54] y'all hear what I'm
[28:56] saying amen Matthew amen says it says
[28:59] Amen in Matthew 16 5:116 let your light
[29:03] so shine before men that they may see
[29:07] your good works and glorify your father
[29:10] which is in
[29:12] heaven so if you are a light to shine
[29:16] then your father must be a light to
[29:18] shine amen right I'm trying to show you
[29:21] by the grace of God you are more than
[29:25] flesh the Bible said quit ye thinking
[29:28] like men and that's the problem we
[29:30] constantly thinking like the cosmos the
[29:33] cosmos has no power it as death in it
[29:37] and Adam and Eve made sure they the
[29:40] devil made sure death came unto us in
[29:43] the cosmos
[29:45] amen that's right there's no power in
[29:50] it amen so much so that even Jesus
[29:53] Christ said I can't do nothing except I
[29:55] see the father do it he understood that
[29:58] that in his Cosmos the human flesh amen
[30:00] there was no power in it it was what was
[30:03] in the flesh not in within the
[30:07] flesh God in
[30:10] flesh am I making
[30:14] sense Matthew
[30:17] 54-15 says
[30:19] this ye are the light of the
[30:23] world a city that is set on a heel
[30:27] cannot be healed
[30:29] right any City I don't care where it
[30:32] where it is if it's on a hill you can
[30:34] see it a far off right it's almost
[30:37] living where I live and you can look
[30:39] down you know I think that's south or
[30:42] whatever is and you can see the Ruan
[30:44] building even though it's in a valley
[30:46] it's it's pitched up high what if it was
[30:49] on the hill that I live on that
[30:53] everything around would be able to see
[30:56] that building for m
[30:59] hello when a city is up on a hill you
[31:02] don't have to get right up on it to see
[31:07] it right so a
[31:09] Christian is seeing a far off I'm going
[31:12] show you spiritually a lot of times you
[31:15] don't even realize what you're working
[31:16] with but people know you're a Christian
[31:19] just by your The Ore about
[31:23] you and right off they hate you if they
[31:26] demon possessed
[31:28] you don't even why people know they snap
[31:30] out you on the
[31:32] phone like this man I'm talking to him
[31:35] about my my my credit card and he
[31:37] treating it like
[31:39] nothing snapping at me talking about how
[31:42] it to look bad for his business if if
[31:44] I'm seen I said you mean to tell me you
[31:46] think people going to be watching me go
[31:48] into your trash in the rain ain't nobody
[31:51] out there
[31:58] but what if it was his credit card I
[32:00] guarantee you he'd be digging right
[32:03] now won't even be thinking about what
[32:05] people
[32:06] think right but see that's the devil
[32:09] it's a challenge now I don't know what
[32:12] God is going to do but you know I'm
[32:14] going to challenge I'm going for it
[32:18] hello if I'm going to preach on light I
[32:20] might as well go to story The
[32:24] Darkness cuz that's Darkness right now
[32:27] that's Darkness this this this is no
[32:31] coincidence I thought Lord what would it
[32:33] be if they call the police while I'm
[32:34] going through his
[32:36] trash I don't think so because he
[32:39] wouldn't want the publicity he's worried
[32:41] about his
[32:46] business anyway whatever God wants me to
[32:48] do is what I'll
[32:50] do y'all can bail me out
[32:53] later I shouldn't be teasing
[32:56] that oh my my God but my point is people
[33:00] Satan is so
[33:03] busy he's so busy but there is no
[33:06] fear there is no fear God has a purpose
[33:10] behind this and I need to find it I
[33:11] might it might be that I need a new
[33:13] number a new new card I don't know we'll
[33:15] see whatever God's will is is what I'll
[33:17] settle for amen so by the grace of God
[33:21] we realize amen that here we are we are
[33:24] a city amen a light a world a city a
[33:27] light a World a city amen is that right
[33:31] listen ye are the light of the world in
[33:34] other words if anybody going to see
[33:35] Jesus Christ truly is going to be
[33:37] through you now the point is amen you
[33:41] got to realize that there is a
[33:45] speech there is a language behind your
[33:48] life
[33:50] amen the Bible said you are living
[33:54] Epistles written and read by all men not
[33:59] some
[34:02] all everybody come in contact there is a
[34:05] language that you are speaking without
[34:08] even uttering a
[34:12] word
[34:14] amen so you and I must realize amen that
[34:18] Satan hates
[34:21] light turn with me Amen to Exodus 10
[34:24] quickly I made mention of this I'm
[34:26] trying to get through this this uh we we
[34:28] are looking at this thing and we said
[34:30] well brother what's going to happen to
[34:32] us I'm telling you we if we could just
[34:34] surrender get on our knees we can pray
[34:38] before God lord add this to me take me
[34:41] through this add to this to me take me
[34:43] through this I'm lacking this and the
[34:45] thing is we don't talk to God like that
[34:48] a lot of us amen but we need to talk to
[34:51] him because he he loves for you to
[34:54] acknowledge you're wrong he said a David
[34:57] is a man of my after my own heart read
[34:59] your Psalms David constantly
[35:03] acknowledged his
[35:05] wrong he recognized amen and I'm going
[35:08] to get you something in just a moment he
[35:10] recognized how holy God was but he also
[35:13] recognize the mercy and grace of
[35:17] God Exodus
[35:21] 10 We're Not Afraid my point is Satan
[35:24] has almost PL pushed us in a closet
[35:26] because we are so afraid afraid to be
[35:28] called a
[35:30] cult we are so afraid Amen to be
[35:33] identified with a prophet because we are
[35:35] we think people going to think we
[35:37] following a
[35:38] man and that's everywhere people don't
[35:41] say it they think they don't feel that
[35:44] way but their life expresses it many of
[35:49] that way where you belong what church
[35:51] you belong to what are your answers what
[35:53] do you believe what are your
[35:55] answers right
[35:58] people saywell you know I'm a Methodist
[36:00] well you know you found it on
[36:02] Wesley right you found it on the
[36:05] teachings of Wesley and all of the ones
[36:07] that were with him right that's but but
[36:09] they're not a cult but you better
[36:11] believe they're more cultist than what
[36:13] we
[36:16] are all right and as you've heard me say
[36:19] the greatest cult ever is the Catholic
[36:23] Church millions and millions of people
[36:25] believing in the Pope that he can
[36:27] forgive their sins and all that
[36:31] nonsense y'all hear what I'm saying you
[36:33] won't find a real Catholic that's
[36:35] ashamed of their faith they'll tell you
[36:39] straight up I'm Catholic I had some of
[36:41] my neighbors tell me that straight up
[36:43] I'm Catholic in other words when they
[36:45] say that they don't bother because it
[36:46] ain't no use of you talking to
[36:51] me we're the
[36:53] original you know what I'm saying so
[36:55] anyway let's go uh uh Exodus 10 you love
[36:59] the Lord now I'm going to tell y'all
[37:02] something the group that I belong to
[37:05] which was Apostolic which was the
[37:06] closest thing to
[37:07] Catholicism and I'm going tell you
[37:09] something they can they can they can
[37:10] look like sugar on the pie as long as
[37:12] you going along with them when you don't
[37:16] when you go against them it's like
[37:17] brother said rubbing that cat the wrong
[37:19] way you going to really be in trouble
[37:22] I'm telling you when I came up out of
[37:24] that system I could see it in their eyes
[37:26] if they could kill me and get away away
[37:27] with that they would
[37:29] have some people who I thought were
[37:31] close friends looked at me with eyes
[37:34] that would would would literally if they
[37:36] could have at least beat me really
[37:39] bad they would have done it now what
[37:42] happened to the Holy
[37:44] Ghost what happened to the Holy Ghost
[37:47] right what I saw was the same thing
[37:50] Jesus saw in the Pharisees and the
[37:55] Sadducees amen
[37:57] so let's let's move on it says listen in
[38:00] Exodus 10: 21-23 it says listen and the
[38:04] Lord said unto Moses stretch out thy
[38:07] hand toward Heaven that there may be
[38:10] Darkness over the land of Egypt even
[38:14] darkness which may be what felt don't
[38:18] tell me you can't feel the
[38:20] darkness and when you go into some
[38:22] cities when I ride through Atlanta I
[38:24] hate going through there cuz it's so
[38:26] creepy when you feel
[38:28] I hate riding down 70 even getting close
[38:30] to Cincinnati I mean it's just what I
[38:34] feel right I mean it's just I mean you
[38:37] you you go even in Lin anybody know what
[38:39] I'm talking about such an oppression
[38:41] such a demon oppression that you feel
[38:45] that's
[38:47] Darkness demon
[38:50] power in
[38:53] control of a city or a
[38:55] town y'all hear what I'm saying I'm
[38:58] saying amen and the only reason why the
[39:01] devil cannot fully control this city
[39:04] like he would is because of you and
[39:07] I God leaving himself a
[39:10] seed hallelujah amen that is the light
[39:14] that's the part that we play in this
[39:16] this day and time as our brother Doug he
[39:20] was it was so good you have been
[39:22] positionally placed in this Darkness as
[39:26] a day star
[39:29] yourself we're the ones that's saying
[39:31] he's really coming we're the ones that's
[39:34] showing the reflection of him right
[39:39] now right so listen we go on and he says
[39:42] listen and Moses stretched forth his
[39:44] hand toward heaven and there was a
[39:46] Darkness uh there was a thick darkness
[39:48] in all the land of Egypt three days they
[39:51] saw not one another come on it was so
[39:55] dark they couldn't even see each other
[39:57] neither Rose any from his place for 3
[40:00] days they were scared they was afraid to
[40:03] walk around it was so dark but all the
[40:06] children of Israel had light in their
[40:11] dwellings come on and you and I are
[40:14] living in such a spiritual Darkness it's
[40:17] everywhere I was up in aan Ohio and I I
[40:20] wanted to get uh brother Jesse's uh uh
[40:23] baby a gift or two and I I I went in and
[40:26] they had a whole in the toy section A
[40:29] whole section on
[40:32] demons literally witches and and and and
[40:35] and and vampires and and and creatures
[40:38] that just didn't make sense in the way
[40:39] they looked and I'm going to tell you
[40:42] something when I walked by it I felt
[40:45] it I felt the darkness and I thought oh
[40:49] my God what a people giving their
[40:54] children demon inspired
[40:58] toys will bring forth they don't have to
[41:01] conjure up nothing amen and bring a
[41:03] portion on you they put it on the
[41:05] toys bring it in your house and then you
[41:08] got chaos oh people don't you don't want
[41:11] to believe that but that's America's
[41:16] Voodoo people don't even realize amen
[41:18] what's really happening amen and they
[41:20] wonder why their children are so bad
[41:23] witchcraft you look you let them they
[41:26] let them I don't even know whether this
[41:28] thing is still on television but years
[41:29] ago they used to have what they call rug
[41:32] rats and they wonder why their children
[41:35] were so bad it's the
[41:38] inspiration Hallelujah they think Bobby
[41:41] is good Bobby is evil she's a
[41:46] prostitute and she's inspiring children
[41:49] to do it they want to be like
[41:54] Bobby oh it's the truth folks they will
[41:58] be if you allow that to
[42:01] continue Bobby don't dress
[42:06] holy huh Bobby you see she's a very very
[42:10] tool of the enemy to make children lust
[42:12] after that so-called
[42:15] Beauty and people don't see it it's
[42:18] molding and shaping those little Spirits
[42:20] into a a prostitution and and and being
[42:23] a
[42:25] whoremonger that's all it is
[42:27] she's a
[42:29] goddest yeah come on somebody she she
[42:33] she really is now that's such a
[42:36] Darkness a Darkness but you see God
[42:39] needs somebody to believe listen I'm
[42:41] going tell you something you they call
[42:43] it
[42:44] brainwashing or you know I've been I've
[42:46] been at the fairground uh when I was in
[42:48] Lia and they had what they call it
[42:52] um hypnosis yeah and these people allow
[42:56] these people to hypnotize them and while
[42:59] they under this hypnosis these people
[43:01] got them barking like dogs all kinds of
[43:04] stuff and then when they snap their fing
[43:06] and they come out of it but who's to say
[43:08] the demon comes out of
[43:12] them they put it in them but it doesn't
[43:15] show it coming
[43:16] out oh come on somebody you open your
[43:20] spirit up to that you've got a problem
[43:22] on your hands
[43:28] oh it's it's just what people do and I
[43:30] don't understand that I thought ain't no
[43:32] way I'm going to allow that myself to
[43:35] submit to that kind of a thing amen the
[43:38] devil he bothers my mind enough I ain't
[43:40] going to give it to
[43:42] him y know what I'm saying here devil
[43:45] you can have it
[43:48] no and and you know but but there just
[43:50] the darkness that people you know one
[43:52] time that was
[43:54] witchcraft one time that was outlawed
[43:58] you know the Salem y'all heard about
[43:59] that how up up Salem amen you know
[44:02] history tells us how many Christians
[44:04] were burned because they were accused of
[44:08] Witchcraft the least little thing you do
[44:11] and all somebody got to say so and so
[44:13] and so and so and so and get somebody to
[44:15] agree especially if they dislike you or
[44:17] hated you and we find out there was a
[44:19] lot of children who would playing Lyon
[44:20] games that got a lot of people killed
[44:25] nonsense but if you can get a man to
[44:29] believe that he's a powerful man he can
[44:33] wear 105 pounds and he'll be hard to
[44:37] take
[44:40] down right you see what I'm saying it's
[44:43] what you believe what you allow yourself
[44:45] to believe and and to be honest with you
[44:48] that's why
[44:50] God brought this word by way of thought
[44:55] he's taken the thought his thought and
[44:58] he's trying to replace his your thoughts
[45:01] with his thoughts see because he's
[45:04] Almighty so he wants you to be
[45:07] Almighty is that right brother said it
[45:09] like that he said listen you're
[45:12] Almighty just as God is
[45:15] Almighty that's what he said he how can
[45:18] that be because you got the almighty in
[45:21] you yeah I ain't talking about your
[45:24] flesh I'm talking about the almighty in
[45:26] you why did Paul said we're more than
[45:28] conquerors through Christ
[45:31] Jesus Hallelujah glory to God Amen it's
[45:36] it it's wonderful the Bible said amen no
[45:38] matter what how dark it was in Egypt
[45:40] amen God Amen there was light and goam
[45:43] and what happened there was a Daybreak
[45:45] Hallelujah when the Daybreak came they
[45:49] were out of Egypt that's what I'm saying
[45:51] there's a Rapture coming and we're right
[45:54] in the moment of the day break amen it's
[45:57] going to get a little rougher people
[45:59] amen but understand this darkness is to
[46:01] bring you to a greater day break we have
[46:05] the greatest Triumph that ever happened
[46:07] in the history of man where hundreds or
[46:10] thousands I don't know how many going
[46:12] amen but there'll be a such a
[46:15] Triumph in the kingdom of
[46:18] God that the celebration will last last
[46:21] three and A2
[46:24] years hey somebody think about
[46:29] it listen the Bible according to you
[46:32] don't have to turn there amen Bible
[46:35] according to Matthew 19:26 says all
[46:38] things are possible with God now now he
[46:42] ain't talking about your flesh but the
[46:44] god that's in you all things are
[46:46] possible amen if he could get you
[46:49] believe right amen because that's the
[46:51] scripture says in Mark 9:23 if thou
[46:54] believest all things are possible
[46:58] huh and what believing is is like
[47:01] Abraham you can see in the Unseen and
[47:04] know that in the Unseen is the same
[47:06] self-existing one the god that created
[47:09] all things and there is nothing too hard
[47:11] for
[47:13] God is that right that's the scriptures
[47:16] that's the word it's like this like like
[47:18] they said those Hebrew boys excuse
[47:20] me if he doesn't Deliver Us I have a
[47:25] revelation of him why should I fear you
[47:28] there is life after death and I can't
[47:31] die God is God if he don't deliver me
[47:36] I'm not going to bow down to what you
[47:37] call God cuz I know it's a
[47:40] lie right oh if he don't Deliver Us from
[47:43] the Council of churches we can't bow to
[47:45] that we know who God
[47:49] is so
[47:51] what like my mother-in-law said why
[47:53] people killing each other so much they
[47:55] going to die anyhow
[47:59] I like
[48:01] that and and it's
[48:06] true why are people killing each other
[48:08] so much they going to die
[48:12] anyhow I'll never forget that anyway
[48:15] we're looking at this thing and I want
[48:17] you to understand by the grace of God As
[48:19] I said this morning when brother renam
[48:22] came he was not only just the evening
[48:23] light but God moved and transitioned him
[48:26] into the place of a Morning Star and
[48:29] what he was doing was hering the coming
[48:31] of the son and he preached the message
[48:34] it is the rising of the sun amen you
[48:37] need to go listen to that because I I
[48:39] haven't listened to it yet but uh in for
[48:41] a while but I got I got a feeling
[48:42] there's something on that tape for
[48:44] me right amen because he didn't preach
[48:47] it just to be preaching but he was
[48:49] basically going to show us what hour we
[48:51] were living in and what to look for to
[48:53] know that that day is about to break
[48:57] amen see the message remember now the
[49:00] message was far ahead of
[49:04] time far far ahead of time and brother
[49:07] brandom said history and time got to
[49:09] catch up with it and where are we we're
[49:12] so close now it's
[49:15] amazing it's amazing and and and I
[49:18] thought to myself the other day I said
[49:20] here it is America is really believing
[49:23] that they can have a woman
[49:25] president it's more it's more it's more
[49:28] of a reality now than ever before and
[49:32] the B Bible tells you no no harm no no
[49:34] harm no heart feeling sisters but the
[49:36] Bible tell us that a woman leader will
[49:38] send you bring you to
[49:42] destruction but she's going to do it
[49:45] because it's time for her
[49:46] destruction Hallelujah not that we are
[49:49] excited about her going down and going
[49:53] under no we're not because amen we're
[49:56] still part of her those of us who've
[49:59] been born and raised amen basically we

[50:20] is not going to allow you to perish
[50:27] not under Darkness if the Bible tells us
[50:31] that he will not let his body see
[50:35] corruption the natural body types the
[50:38] spiritual body he will not allow Satan
[50:43] to corrupt your soul he can't do it he
[50:48] can't do it because you're part of his
[50:51] body
[50:53] amen before God would allow that he'll
[50:56] put you to
[50:58] sleep
[51:00] hello he said well brother Brooks I've
[51:02] done so much thank God for the

[58:32] that's what he he reveals himself in
[58:36] Fire and light you know that not in the
[58:39] cosmic light condition like your flesh
[58:42] and things you see he see he he said
[58:44] well you know no even Paul says we don't
[58:48] even know Jesus Christ after the flesh

[58:56] Hallelujah but that wasn't that wasn't
[58:59] what God wanted us to see he wanted us
[59:01] to see the fire and the light that was
[59:04] behind the
[59:06] flesh they make tradition out of his
[59:08] life that's
[59:10] wrong that's not salvation is the word
[59:14] he preached that's what Jesus said my
[59:17] word the word I preach is
[59:22] life you don't have to go on the Sea of
[59:24] Galilee and throw the and act like
[59:29] Jesus you don't thank God we don't cuz
[59:32] most of us wouldn't have the money to
[59:34] get
[59:35] there now we're living in the age I'm
[59:38] almost done I know I feel a little warm
[59:40] in here I'm I'm enjoying it but you know
[59:42] what I mean I'm from South down south

[59:48] thing amen I want you to realized by the
[59:50] grace of God because thou this is the
[59:52] age we're living in and we we forget

[59:59] with goods and have need of nothing and
[1:00:01] knoweth not that thou art wretched and
[1:00:04] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[1:00:08] now we look at the denomination
[1:00:10] Christians and they look so
[1:00:12] happy look like they got something we
[1:00:14] don't have that ain't the
[1:00:18] scripture it's just a
[1:00:21] facade it really is because the Bible
[1:00:24] said in there is every unclean and
[1:00:27] hateful bird all you got to do is try
[1:00:30] them push them the wrong way and you'll
[1:00:33] see how holy they
[1:00:34] are come on somebody it's true amen and
[1:00:38] you but we look at it we think oh my
[1:00:40] they got something they ain't got
[1:00:42] nothing no they just assume they've got
[1:00:44] something and I'm not pointing my
[1:00:47] fingers I'm just telling you what the
[1:00:48] word says amen we can receive it or we
[1:00:52] don't have to receive it but my point is
[1:00:55] because we think oh H let me tell you
[1:00:58] something there will not be a wiping the
[1:01:00] tears away from your eyes if everybody
[1:01:02] you so-call think going to be there

[1:01:08] there brother B said the wiping the
[1:01:10] tears away from your eyes is will be
[1:01:12] taking away your memory of the loved
[1:01:14] ones that didn't make
[1:01:16] it it'll be as if they never
[1:01:19] existed thank God for
[1:01:23] that how can Heaven Be Heaven thinking
[1:01:25] about those you missed and
[1:01:28] lost but you got to realize people those
[1:01:31] who you missed and lost were never
[1:01:35] family I know that's hard to swallow but
[1:01:38] it's true they never were
[1:01:42] family a y'all at least ought to say

[1:02:49] God there's a way of God res
[1:02:53] restitution he's a just God if he
[1:02:56] blinded them then there are those in
[1:02:58] there he blinded and
[1:03:01] will
[1:03:04] say that's what the foolish version is
[1:03:06] about if they could have seen it they
[1:03:08] would have repented they would have done
[1:03:11] it but he had a five foolish and a five

[1:10:13] after the
[1:10:15] conquest of of of of of death Health
[1:10:18] Hell In The Grave brother R tells us how

[1:10:27] approached amen there was a a scream go
[1:10:34] out open up ye gates or lift up your
[1:10:37] heads all you
[1:10:39] Gates and let the king of glory come in
[1:10:43] and the question came back from Heaven
[1:10:46] because they wanted to know who the king
[1:10:47] of

[1:12:24] kind of dayone that has no feeling no
[1:12:27] emotions and can't do nothing but stand
[1:12:29] up in a
[1:12:30] corner we're serving the almighty God
[1:12:34] that knows the very intense and thoughts
[1:12:36] of your heart there ain't nothing too
[1:12:38] hard for God it's your mind that keeps
[1:12:41] God from working because God cannot work
[1:12:43] with
[1:12:44] unbelief he believeth if you can believe
[1:12:47] all things are possible if you can
[1:12:48] believe you can say to this mountain be
[1:12:50] thy moving it shall be given and
[1:12:52] done it's you now the Bible tells us and
[1:12:57] I love this this this this this the

[1:13:28] showeth knowledge in other words 24
[1:13:32] hours the heavens and the stars are
[1:13:37] preaching in the day time the sun

[1:13:45] son there's only one son there's only
[1:13:47] one life of the son and I give life to
[1:13:51] everything that I sign
[1:13:53] upon right he said even though I come up
[1:13:57] early in the morning as a little child
[1:13:59] in the evening I'm a strong man tearing
[1:14:01] up everything people running from the
[1:14:04] Heat and in the evening time I'm getting
[1:14:07] ready to settle down I'm becoming an old

[1:14:49] blink in and blink out he saids it
[1:14:51] doesn't matter God's grace is sufficient

[1:15:41] throne amen he will as a natural man
[1:15:44] he'll sit there in Jerusalem declaring
[1:15:47] that he is God oh come on y'all think
[1:15:50] that that the Vatican want America real
[1:15:52] bad she want Jerusalem more
[1:15:55] Soul she want Jerusalem more worse than
[1:15:58] anything else and guess what she's going
[1:16:00] to get
[1:16:01] her the Bible said he'll sit in the
[1:16:04] temple of God declaring that he is God
[1:16:06] and he will do it where right there
[1:16:09] where that Temple
[1:16:13] is ain't God good to us I'm trying to
[1:16:16] hurry up the Bible said there is no
[1:16:18] speech nor language where their voice is
[1:16:21] not heard how can the Stars preach in
[1:16:23] every language God said they
[1:16:26] do if any man look up in the heavens he
[1:16:29] can understand that there is truly a God
[1:16:32] I don't care if he's Chinese Asian
[1:16:34] African make no difference Englishman
[1:16:36] Dutchman whatever if he listen and look
[1:16:40] he'll know that there's a God
[1:16:42] somewhere y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:16:45] they will preach to him their lines is
[1:16:47] gone out through all the Earth and their
[1:16:49] words to the end of the world in them
[1:16:51] have he set a tabernacle of the sun I
[1:16:55] is that right no matter how great those
[1:16:58] planets are those stars
[1:16:59] out guess what they're not greater than
[1:17:02] our
[1:17:03] son you say what do you mean because of
[1:17:05] the way brother brandham described
[1:17:07] creation he said there was a big ball
[1:17:09] God said let that be and he talks about
[1:17:11] how everything came from that one
[1:17:14] source it had to because everything came
[1:17:17] from the One Source amen right and it's
[1:17:20] still exploding and going on and going
[1:17:22] on and going on is that okay
[1:17:25] now listen we talk about his ministry
[1:17:28] and everything this morning amen and and
[1:17:31] I believe with all of my heart brother B
[1:17:32] I'm talk about that light and everything
[1:17:34] else but let me look what he says here
[1:17:36] he says now God is so wonderful standing
[1:17:40] at this big OB Observatory not long ago
[1:17:43] where you could take and look through
[1:17:46] that glass and see 120 million light
[1:17:49] years of light space then you'll see the
[1:17:52] vastness of God in his universe and you
[1:17:55] thinker we look at this son and think
[1:17:58] that this is the only son there are sons
[1:18:02] and Sons and orbits and Suns and planets
[1:18:06] and Sons Beyond this one till it may
[1:18:09] rank in the millions and God over all
[1:18:13] this universe sitting there governing it
[1:18:18] could you imagine and I love this who
[1:18:21] God is could you draw in any idea who
[1:18:27] God is and what he is see that's all he
[1:18:31] wants is his creation to know
[1:18:37] him and the point is there is no period
[1:18:41] am we have come through eternity learn
[1:18:44] about
[1:18:47] him huh now he goes on in the message
[1:18:50] resurrection of Lazarus he said God
[1:18:52] become bized down to the lost I can hear
[1:18:56] him say let there be light and all the
[1:19:00] Adams burst out yonder and the son come
[1:19:04] into existence and he says deity what
[1:19:07] was he doing typing it out showing amen
[1:19:11] amen what God was doing in the beginning
[1:19:15] there's only one source of life there's
[1:19:17] only one eternal life and God by Cosmos
[1:19:21] tried to show his
[1:19:23] creation but because remember Adam
[1:19:26] couldn't feel taste and all that stuff
[1:19:30] but he was already a man before he was
[1:19:33] form and God formed him in the cosmos so
[1:19:37] that he can make connection with the
[1:19:40] cosmos so did God do unto us we were
[1:19:43] born into the cosmos is that all right
[1:19:46] but understand by the grace of God
[1:19:48] before we got here there's a
[1:19:52] theophany there is a word body
[1:19:55] that literally stands in the presence of
[1:19:57] God the Bible call it your angel brother
[1:19:59] bandam said that's your theophany that
[1:20:01] literally stands in the presence of God
[1:20:04] he said and when you receive this
[1:20:06] message you have heard from your
[1:20:13] theophany I'm almost done just bear with
[1:20:15] me okay Psalms 91 I just know we yeah 91
[1:20:20] you love the Lord now he's a powerful a
[1:20:23] powerful anybody
[1:20:28] know let me say say it like this you
[1:20:32] think you you know we think we're so so
[1:20:34] such we got so much power and so much
[1:20:37] strength is there any human being in
[1:20:40] here that could literally look at the
[1:20:42] sun straight without any glasses and not
[1:20:46] go
[1:20:47] blind anybody here can do
[1:20:50] it but look how far away it is
[1:20:56] look how far away it is from the Earth
[1:20:59] and yet we're
[1:21:01] not designed to look him straight in the
[1:21:07] eye one of these old days we will
[1:21:10] though but these bodies are
[1:21:13] Fallen right and too much of the sun
[1:21:16] will wither us will cause us to die like
[1:21:19] brother B asked a question to a doctor
[1:21:21] said listen I don't understand do said
[1:21:23] how come I'm aging said when I was a
[1:21:26] young fell I used to eat the same food
[1:21:29] and I eat that food it make me strong
[1:21:31] now I'm eating the same food and I'm
[1:21:33] getting weaker what is it God's word
[1:21:36] being
[1:21:37] fulfilled right death is in the
[1:21:41] body death is in the body H Allelujah
[1:21:44] y'all getting tired I know it's kind let
[1:21:46] me let me just go here and then then
[1:21:47] I'll shut down I I said that the last
[1:21:50] time didn't I Psalm 91
[1:21:56] 1-8 he that dwelleth in the secret place
[1:21:59] of the most high shall abide under the
[1:22:01] shadow of the
[1:22:03] Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my
[1:22:07] refuge and my Fortress my God in him
[1:22:11] will I trust surely he shall deliver
[1:22:14] thee from the snares of the fow and from
[1:22:16] the Noland pestilence he shall cover
[1:22:18] thee with his feathers and under his
[1:22:21] wings shallal thou Trust his trust shall
[1:22:25] be thy shield and
[1:22:29] buckler now I I want to I want to just
[1:22:32] interject something here now listen look
[1:22:34] what God does he shows how powerful he
[1:22:36] is by
[1:22:37] describing how he can shelter you under
[1:22:41] his wing
[1:22:43] feathers
[1:22:44] feathers
[1:22:48] feathers he can protect you under
[1:22:52] feathers thou shall not be afraid of the
[1:22:54] terror by night nor for The Hour That
[1:22:57] flyth by day nor for the pestilence that
[1:23:00] walk in darkness nor for the destruction
[1:23:03] that wasted at noon day A thousand shall
[1:23:06] fall at thy side what can you believe
[1:23:10] that a thousand shall fall at thy side
[1:23:14] 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall
[1:23:17] not come n thee now I believe
[1:23:22] that only with Thine Eyes shall thou
[1:23:26] behold and see the wi reward of the
[1:23:29] wicked because thou has made the Lord
[1:23:33] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:23:37] thy
[1:23:38] habitation you've made in your
[1:23:42] habitation I'm going to I'm going to
[1:23:45] habitate in
[1:23:46] this you made him your habitation and
[1:23:49] therefore because you have made him your
[1:23:51] habitation
[1:23:55] you're
[1:23:56] safe from
[1:23:59] Pence hello from
[1:24:04] diseases you're
[1:24:07] safe let's
[1:24:12] stand that same creative
[1:24:16] power that was once outside is now
[1:24:20] inside and I'm going tell you something
[1:24:22] because he's inside doesn't mean he's
[1:24:25] lost any of his
[1:24:27] strength he's as omnipotent in you as he
[1:24:30] is outside of
[1:24:33] you the trouble is is our own faith our
[1:24:36] own
[1:24:37] belief you know we we we we we we we
[1:24:41] just limit God and that's one of the
[1:24:42] worst things you can do is limit
[1:24:45] God and we do that you know why because
[1:24:48] God doesn't answer on our
[1:24:52] Tim and Satan will come right around and
[1:24:54] say see he can't do it what do you mean
[1:24:57] he did do it until you doubt
[1:24:59] it is that right come on it's the truth
[1:25:02] when you ask God for anything believe
[1:25:04] that you shall receive it God said he
[1:25:06] said amen by the grace of God if you
[1:25:09] abide in my word and my word abide in
[1:25:11] you you could ask whatsoever you will
[1:25:12] now if it comes short then where are you
[1:25:15] abiding that's what I'm saying and if
[1:25:17] you are abiding in him you still wait on
[1:25:19] it amen that's all you can do that's all
[1:25:22] we can do but God timetable is not ours
[1:25:27] like he said you know the skeptic during
[1:25:29] the court case said well listen you said
[1:25:31] that God was going to do it and he
[1:25:33] didn't do it and brother but God never
[1:25:35] said he a Time amen he didn't he never
[1:25:39] said when he was going to give you when
[1:25:40] you would be healed he said if you
[1:25:41] believe it you would be healed you would
[1:25:44] be delivered why you got to have a time
[1:25:45] I don't care about the
[1:25:50] time you and I must recognize by the
[1:25:52] grace of God if we trust him you wait on
[1:25:57] him that's it because I'm going to tell
[1:26:00] you something if you don't guess who's
[1:26:01] on the other side of the fence waiting
[1:26:03] for
[1:26:06] you I remember when I was a little boy
[1:26:09] you know that my neighbor you know our
[1:26:11] neighborhood we had this you know it was
[1:26:13] a doctor in my house and you know my
[1:26:16] doctor had doctor had a big old tree and
[1:26:20] he had a great

[1:26:24] mean they were the green good kind of
[1:26:26] grapes sweet as I don't know
[1:26:28] what and my brother said I'm going to
[1:26:31] give me some of them grapes I said I
[1:26:33] ain't going over there they didn't have
[1:26:35] no dog that man didn't need no
[1:26:37] dog but my point is my brother got up
[1:26:41] that man waited till my brother got up
[1:26:42] in the midst of his tree he had this
[1:26:47] big and he wo him out of that
[1:26:50] tree I don't I to this day I still think
[1:26:52] the graes weren't worth it
[1:26:56] you hear what I'm saying and that's what
[1:26:58] Satan would do as long I was on the
[1:26:59] other side of the wall right I wasn't
[1:27:02] foolish enough amen well it look like
[1:27:05] ain't nobody home I don't care what it

[1:27:09] grave it was in the
[1:27:11] daytime even if it had been in the night
[1:27:14] I knew there were consequences y'all
[1:27:16] hear what I'm saying and that's what you
[1:27:18] and I must believe there's always a
[1:27:20] consequence for sin disbelief unbelief
[1:27:23] you going to pay one way or another why
[1:27:25] not do it God's way and be
[1:27:30] rewarded my brother I know he'll never
[1:27:33] forget that whooping cuz I
[1:27:35] won't and I wasn't the one that was
[1:27:37] giving lick Hallelujah he might have
[1:27:39] enjoyed a few of those grapes I'm
[1:27:41] guaranteeing those leaks was hard right
[1:27:44] and not only did the man whip him he
[1:27:45] took him to my mama and told her about
[1:27:47] him keep him out of my yard you know
[1:27:49] what he said all he had to do was ask
[1:27:56] all he had to do was ask and listen I
[1:27:58] don't care how how good the grapes are
[1:28:00] on the other side if you ask God God to
[1:28:02] have few of them drop on your
[1:28:05] side huh you don't have to steal it just
