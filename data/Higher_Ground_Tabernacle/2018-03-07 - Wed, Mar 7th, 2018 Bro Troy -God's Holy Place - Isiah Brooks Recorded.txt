Ezekiel chapter 14 amen and then we'll start with C code chapter 14 start with the first verse amen speak a message called God's holy place amen it says the first verse then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me and set before me and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face should I be inquired of at all by them therefore speak unto them is saying to them thus saith the Lord God every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and put us the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the Prophet I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols [Music] that I may take the house of Israel and their own heart because they're all estranged from me through their idols amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just come into you together Lord in a solemn evening father with a solemn Scripture father Lord because we are all trusting in the father that you Lord have given us a great and a mighty message in this day but all Lord won't to us father if we would come to this message and acquire at your message father with the stumbling block of iniquity before the face before our own face Lord Lord I pray father there be anybody here in this room tonight in this in this little building father Lord there be guilty of such a thing father that that this would be the night Lord that you would convict them father or above their sins and the stumbling blocks of their new kitty's Nicolay's father Lord that they may have a total and a complete healing father florid in the name of Lord Jesus you came more to restore and to set the captives free and father but if the captors do not want to go free or what can you do so father but we we know that this is still the age of grace father Lord and while there is still time father we want to be we want to do all that we can follow to make sure Lord that we have swept our steps father and and we have kept the holy place as a place of communion with you Lord and Lord we just dedicate this this night into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated a man I I have turned to the scripture many times over the last I'd say year or so your Bible with sometimes it's throughout the years it opens to certain places repeatedly you know and you know and you go in the opener Biola and you know a long time my Bible always open to Nahum chapter 1 I never did figure out why my bio would always dopant the name net chapter one but but repeatedly over the years my this scripture has caught my eye over and over and over again and the thing that bothers me the most about I shouldn't say bothers me but that disturbs me not about the scripture about about the implications of the scripture is that here the Prophet was Ezekiel was a prophet of the Most High God a man who is chosen and elected by God to carry the word for his day amen were the the people that were in captivity for their sins the people that had been taken in prison and they were dwelling in the in the promised land where all of God's promises lie there in Jerusalem they were at peace they were they were in comfort and but because of their repeated sin after sin after sin after a God and His Word and his prophets that they finally God had enough and he put them in captivity and when he put them in captivity they were taken in their imprisoned by Babylon and they were taken 500 miles away to go serve the land of Babylon amen for the for the sins that they committed but yet God in His great mercy and his kindness they even though they were living in a Babylonia SH age in a Babylonia City God still had mercy upon them and set them his word through a prophet even though they were in captivity he didn't just cast them off and say that's it you're done but but it is great mercy and his kindness that even in their chains even in their captivity even in the mists of lerner laying down in their sins even in the midst of them serving the foreign gods and serving the foreign government and serving the the money and the and creating value to Babylon instead of creating value in God's own kingdom and instead of instead of the instead of the children of Israel and the children of the Great God Jehovah being in God's promised land and creating value there now they are in the king of Babylon and creating value for the devil and all of his foolishness and yet in spite of all that God in His great mercy and his great kindness and it gave them a profit in which the Word of God could be placed in and so that in the midst of their chains in the midst of all their wickedness in the midst of all their other just ranked to file me are these they were defiled think about it they were defiled they there were what left what what was less it could have happened to it they lost all of God's promises they lost all of God's holiness they lost all of their priesthood they lost their sacrifices they lost their Kingdom they lost their throne they lost everything and now they are there serving the devil and yet God still in the midst of it had mercy upon them and gave them a profit upon whom the Word of God could come straight from from God's own mouth to the people in the myths of Babel but in spite of all of that in spite of the great mercy being shown to them in spite of the second chance the third chance the fourth chance the fifth chance the six genes in spite of every chance being given unto them that when God extended his hand down and put his words into the mouth of the Prophet that the elders when they came to oh and then when they came to realize that this man Ezekiel was a prophet of the Most High God and they say we need to go and inquire of this man because he has the voice of God we need to go and talk to this man we need to go listen to this man's words we need to go miss Liz because he is a prophet of the Most High God way to go listen to this man's tapes we need to go to a message church we need to go and listen to listen to what the message of the hour says and in spite of all of that great mercy that God has showed them they came in and they inquired before the Prophet and as soon as they it says their verse Allah then came certain of the elders of Israel and they set down before me as we all are sitting down tonight in what we call a message church before the message of the hour given to us by a prophet in the midst of this Mystery Babylon II they in spite of all that that they came and they sat down to enquire to see if God would say anything to them but when God spoke it was such such a chastisement beyond a chastisement a judgement because when God finally spoke out the thing that he said to them is he says these men these elders of the house of Israel are coming to enquire before my identified mouthpiece of the age they want to hear what I have to say to them be it when they come to me they still have the mystery of iniquity before their face they still have the things that I identified age after age after age is being wrong they still have not the thing that stumbled them back there in Jerusalem is the same thing as stumbling them here and know that my judgment has been made plain and clear they still want to come and enquire to see if I have some new thing to say to them when they would not even obey the old thing the last thing I said to a man if they will not obey the law of Moses why should they inquire at Ezekiel's mouth and the same thing today if we will not obey the words of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ why should we inquire of the Prophet William Branham Amen if we knew if we will not obey the words of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ why should we ever play another tape if we will not do if we will not do the the basic things of the gospel then why should we ever acquire of something further the God if we would come to a church such as this and clean and sit here underneath the manifestations of the of the of the message of the hour and and the revealed truths a man of this hour but yet we will not remove the stumbling block of iniquity before our face verse 3 son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face should I be inquired of at all by them therefore speak unto them and saying to them thus saith the Lord God every man of the house of Israel that hath set up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumbling block of his initely before his face and cometh to the Prophet I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols you know we all would love to have an answer from the Most High God to have God speak to us face-to-face to have an answer to the questions of our life is a beautiful thing well you have a great question in your life and God comes and answers the question it's a beautiful thing when you have things that you just can't seem to get over or this or that and I also in God comes and answers the thing it's a beautiful thing Amen but what if you go to approach unto the Lord for an answer and he comes back to you and says you've known this was wrong year after year after year after year and you've let this sit before your face and now you want to inquire of the message of William Branham and see if that message will have some new revelation for you but you won't even take care of the iniquity that's in front of your face whatever of you I have looked at this scripture over and over again over the months and I have not preached shani as of yet until now and I every time I see it it shakes me it causes me to search my own soul if by any chance there might be something that that I have lord I have I have I looked over have I have I left something undone father am i failing at the simplicity of the gospel Lord am I am I missing some of the ABCs Lorna have I have I done something Laura is there anything in my life Lord that that is such a simple thing something I know that I ought to do that I'm not doing or is there anything in my life Lord Laura I want to come and inquire it the message of the hour Lord I want to be faithful to what the message says but O Lord is there something that I've missed from the very ABCs of the gospel it's something that we think oh you know we're here in Mystery Babylon we want to say that we'll stand up and say we are overcomers in this age we have done all that we can to overcome but but if we miss the simple things in the gospel then then we're no better than those how can we ever come against those elders of the house of Israel we could look at them and give out our judgments and say why couldn't they see why couldn't they obey why couldn't they do this why couldn't they pay their ties why couldn't they serve their serve their King why couldn't they worship Jehovah why couldn't they follow the Ten Commandments why couldn't they do these basic things and went but when they come to acquire the Prophet the Lord points right back and says the answer is right in your face you have the stumbling block of your iniquity as right there the idols that you were worship are in your own home and those idols are right there and you want to come and inquire before the prophet of the Most High God and seek a revelation from me and I says I will not answer you but I'll answer you according to the stumbling block of iniquity that you put before your face amen I know I've preached several times on Ezekiel 40 kaptur 42 43 recently and if you can remember at the risk of repeating myself over and over again when in Ezekiel chapter 40 zekiel there in the land of Babylon and is down by the river Chebar God all sudden picks him up and he sees the God of heaven and God picks him up he transports him all the way five hundred miles over to the land of Jerusalem but when he gets to Jerusalem God sets the prophet Ezekiel up on top of a great and high mountain and he looks over the land he sees this temple that is in perfect condition we're in the temple he knew and his mind had been destroyed and was laying in fire and ruins and he's standing there and he's seen this image of a perfect complete and pure and sanctified and holy temple he's like Lord what is this and the Lord tells them yeah I want you to go and take a tour of this temple I want you to go and measure every room I want you to listen and write down that is I'm getting ready to scribe this temple to you and I want you to write down the full description of this temple and he goes and spends three chapters telling the Lord is telling the prophet Ezekiel there are seven steps here there's a Paul there's a column here and has pomegranates all over it there's an archway over here and there's the holy place here and the walls here and this gate here and this gate me and he goes knee describes the entire temple into a great detail even though that temple was not yet standing on the earth and though after after he spends three chapters describing every single part of the stipple he says son of man I want you to go back and take this description to the to the elders of the house of Israel the ones we just got talking about here I want you to take the description of the house of this temple and take this description to them and make them jealous that their sins and their iniquities have prevented this temple from being built but their sins and their iniquities have prevented from such a temple standing in God's own holy land and so in when Ezekiel goes he takes this this description of the house to the house of Israel he says this was God's desire that he would have a house that is perfect and standing by you for your sins have made it a house be a house of fire and ruins there our animal animals are wandering through the holiest of Holies amen the unclean creatures are stumbling into the holy place and my house is supposed to be a house of prayer has now lay in a house of ruins and make them a shame because they're it's their bone iniquities they have caused that and we know that God has ordained all of us to be lively stones amen and every stone has a has a has a place you know tonight I had no idea what to preach and I don't think I've ever struggled so hard to find a message as I did today I went through all of my notes from here to back to 2009 to find a message to preach I couldn't find one I went through everything I could think of I leaf to the Bible couldn't find anything and finally I got down on my knees and I just opened my Bible and this is what I open to but while I was going through my notes I found a little drawing that had created a long time ago as a drawing of a pyramid that was missing the capstone and how the side of that pyramid here on the side was missing a little chunk of a certain shape and then I drew a little chunk off over here of that same shape and that little chunk had a little message bowl and it was crying out oh cleft in the rock place for me Lord let me hide myself in thee we are all designed to fit inside a certain shape we are designed to be a part of the temple the Most High God amen let's hurry to Ezekiel chapter 43 real quick after the description of the temple God went a step further after spending three chapters describing the physical nature of the building he in verse 1 of 43 he describes another attribute of this building and that attribute was the presence of the Most High God amen as zekiel chapter 43 verse 1 says afterward he brought me to the gate even to the gate to look us toward the east keep your heart facing the right direction sings and behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east and his voice was like the noise of many waters and the Earth's shined with his glory and he was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar and I fell down upon my face and the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate was Prospect toward the east so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house and I heard him speaking unto me out of the house and the man stood by me and he said to me son of man the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever and my holy name shall the house of Israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their whoredom nor by the carcasses of their kings and their high places and their setting of their threshold by my thresholds and their posts by my posts the wall between me and them they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed wherefore I have consumed them in my anger now let them put away their hoard them and their carcasses of their kings far from me and I will dwell in the midst of them forever now son of man show the house up to the house of Israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern and if they be ashamed of all that they have done show them the form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out thereof and the comings in thereof and all the forms thereof and all the ordinances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the laws thereof and write it in their sight that they may keep the whole form there if and all the ordinances thereof and do them watch this the 12th verse and this is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain the whole limit their roundabout shall be most holy behold this is the law of the house the law of the house is that it shall be most holy amen and there is only one gate that he will come into there is only one gate and that is the gate this prospect is towards East Amen if your heart is facing towards the Lord Amen and you have opened up the gate and the the only way you can open up the gate is when the stumbling block of iniquity is put away from your face and the molten ooh of your idols are put away all your TV screens all your foolish this is a Babylon all of Hollywood is put away all the all the all the windows of Babylon David's we stare to the window of Bathsheba the screens are put away all the foolishness all the all things we look at with our eyes that we hear with our ears and we touch with our senses amen all the wickedness that comes out our mouth when we put on a stumbling block of our iniquity away and we submit ourselves to obeying the Full Gospel the whole Word of God step by step amen and when we do it put our heart and repent of all of our sins and our fate on our heart is finally facing towards the east then because the law of the house is is in my house will be holy amen and if the house refuses to be holy then you will not be a part of his house is that clear they said my house will never be defiled 570 fears before Christ he said my house will never be defiled again that's a promise my house will not be defiled again amen his house will be sealed until the day of its Redemption amen there there will be a ceiling of the house and it cannot be defile amen and and Andy in the as we if you remember when we were preached the message called anointed kings and priests that the the priest was over the house it was over the temple they had to many of the temple but the king was to extend the dominion of of that that holy place to the furthermost boundaries of israel from north to south east to west amen and he had said in the Book of Revelations that he has made us kings and priests unto our God amen amen we are to - we are to repent of our sins step 1 repent of all the foolishness repent of all our sins step 1 step to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen when you are baptized you are testifying I hear on the earth that I am done with the things of Babylon I am done with the things of the world I am dead to the things of the world so I can be alive under the things of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that is what we testify when we're going down into baptism that step - amen and if and if a time in our life we decide that we want to go back and rename it is and I will give you the gift of the Holy Ghost and I will seal you until the day of your destination step 4 we will submit ourselves unto the leadership of the Holy Ghost and commit ourselves under prayer and reading the Bible and when we find things that contrary that our grievious Thole ghosts that we will repent of them and if somehow by some by some stubbornness of our own nature that we allow our our conscious to be seared as with a hot iron and if we allow and we can no longer then we no longer feel guilty for our sins that we have allowed things in our lives to run contrary to the scriptures for so long and that our conscious has now been seared the hot iron and we have now agreed the way the Holy Ghost so they cannot impact us anymore he can't lead us anymore that somehow the God is some guy I'm gonna have to break through all of that and shake you back down to you off your high horse and knock you back down to the ground until somehow someway maybe perchance you might be able to hear his voice again otherwise you're just being stubborn this which the Bible says that's the same as witchcraft people sitting in the pews and the chairs of the church and guilty of witchcraft because of their stubbornness against the gospel their stubbornness against the revealed word for this hour and they'll come and enquire before the Prophet and listen to the tapes and listening to the anointed ministers that bring the quotes from the tapes and inquire of the Prophet but yet the stumbling block of their iniquity as before their face because they will not obey that the basic tenants of the gospel the law of the house is it will be holy that is the law of the house and Christ is coming back or a holy house and a holy temple amen let's turn over to Psalms 91 we'll read Psalms 90 the first two chapters or first two verses then we'll read Psalms 91 the first two verses there's some prayer Moses here Lord thou has been our dwelling place in all generations before the mountains were brought forth wherever thou has formed the earth from the and the world for even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God Psalms 91 verse 1 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I'll say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust amen you know God has always had at all times in all places God has always had a holy place he's never failed to have a place the Hagenbach all his holy place this and the holy place is a place where God has his throne it's a place where he is revered above all of all other gods is he has the preeminence in that place it is a place that is holy it is clean there is no no mess there there is no dust there is no no no other all idols there is no other worship to any other gods it is a holy place where God is worshipped amen and in that holy place God's Word has the preeminence over all other words and against over all over all other thoughts amen and before the foundation of the world when when when God was worshiped up in heaven by the Angels and and and Satan Lucifer the cherub that covereth as the Bible says when he this when he began to bring his word and exalt it up over the word of God and when start drawing angels after himself then there was no more room in heaven for for Satan and Satan bound a third of the Angels to himself who all who exalted the word of Lucifer over the Word of God and because of that there was no more room in God's holy place for for Satan and his angels amen so they were cast down to the earth as Jesus said I behold Satan fall from heaven like lightning and and why how did he behold me because because of the exaltation of over Satan's word over God's own word in God's own holy place which cannot stand amen and so when Satan found himself cast down into the end of the earth as the earth was being formed by God and he washed as God began to bring up the trees and and bring up the fish and he and he created the firmament and he created the sky in the waters and and the plants and all those things and and everything was good was good was good and when when God say I'm gonna create me any garden called Eden and he went and he took all the best things of all the Earth's why so that his people will have a holy place that they could dwell in amen and when he and when God had finished the Eden he placed his son and his daughter there in Eden so that they could dwell in the holy place of God where God's Word would reign supreme amen and what did Satan do being cast out into the earth roaming the earth looking for a place to dwell looking for a place he could call home looking for a place of comfort amen he could not find a place so he sneaks into God's own garden and he and he and he goes and he goes and he starts talking to Eve he once more starts exalting his word over the Word of God and not only that but he got Eve to do the same thing and so what happened now all of a sudden there is no more room in God's holy place for Satan but also now for her God's own son and daughter and so they had to leave Eden to gods because God's holy place once more God's own word was being detracted from and not given the free minutes and God holy place and so when when God started drawing the children of Israel out of Egypt he wanted to restore a holy place unto the children of men Amen so he created a so he got he God took his own work he inscribed it on two tablets of stone with his own finger he said thou shalt not do this thou shalt not do that that I should not do this I wrote out the Ten Commandments in stone with his own finger he took those tablets of stone and he had Moses create a box called the Ark of the Covenant amen and they put it over with gold they put the mercy seat on the top they anointed it with the sacrifice amen they put it inside the holiest of Holies to protect it amen and in there the kind of glory of God would watch over it amen and then they put that around the holy paste around that Amen protected some more and there on that to put a courtyard then they gave that dominion over to the priests to keep the to keep the sanctity of the holy place a man so thinking they had the priests over the sacrifice why so that God's Word would have some protection God's own word would be protected and revered and so nothing could detract from from God's Word and now not only that but they took all that and they surrounded that with two million Israelites let me tell you nothing was gonna get to the Word of God no nobody could had to get by the two million is White's they have to get beyond the priesthood get beyond the courtyard beyond the holy place into the holiest of Holies but past the Shekinah fire of the Lord and to get to the Word of God God was protecting his work why because God did not want in his holy place to be defiled again and in God's own holy place God's Word was gonna be protected but the priests time after time again Satan was finding his way into God's own holy place when David was a guy excited about the the the the the prom the Ark of the Covenant coming back to be set up on high upon the mountain he got so excited he wrote that Psalm like God be exalted and all of his enemies will fall down you know when God when God like God arise and all of his enemies be scattered he was talking about the Ark of the Covenant going back up Zions Hill amen but he decided to between the dark the covenant was saying go up Zions Hill that it should go up on a cart which was contrary to the Word of God so now the Word of God was riding on a cart contrary to the very word that was on the inside of the box amen and there's no wonder that when one of the oxen stumbled at the man driving the oxen got scared that the Word of God and had fall to the ground it reached out and he put his hand on the Ark of the Covenant and the man died God smote him dead why because God's Word was in danger of stumbling once again God's Word was put in danger of falling on the ground just like Eve let the Word of God fall on the ground and once more in God's own holy place God's Word was being detracted from amen and now we get to Ezekiel he says they look I want you to show them the pattern this is what their sins have caused why because they would not revere my holy place I destroyed it and I want you to show them the pattern of the house and description of it and I'm going to write it out it's gonna be a long writing he says write it all in their sight and he hits writing and writing and writing in their sight and give out the description and let them know that the law of my house is gonna be holiness the law of my house they will never to file again and let me tell you if you are keeping defilement in your heart then you will find yourself on the outside of the house because God has given his word and the law of the house is it will be holy with you or without you it will be holy with you or without you will be holy you know Christ died on the cross he bore our shame he bore our nakedness he bore our sins he bore all of our sickness all those things he died for and paid he felt pain amen he suffered for 33 years resisting the things that we give in to so easily think about that 33 years in a body of flesh resisting the things that we just so flippantly give into and then died to take away our sins and the Bible says that fools will walk the palm nail shoes where angels fear to try as the angels watch the sacrifice and the beatings that he went through and the reverence that they gave to him as brother branham said that every tree the trees were filled with angels as all of Mount Calvary was filled with millions and billions of angels waiting that if Jesus Christ would say one word save me take me away from this angels come get me off the cross that they were waiting for one command from his lips but yea he bore all the pain all the shame dying naked upon the cross he died naked for our nakedness a man he took beatings for our beatings a man and and then when we flippantly give in to the same things that he resisted we do despite against the grace which with we were purchased amen we ought to protect everything that Christ died for we ought to protect everything that Jesus Christ died for it amen if he died for our nakedness we all stay clothed in the baptism of the holy ghost if he died for our sins then I'll keep righteousness at the forefront a varied everything we do amen if he died that his spirit might come back on us and we all seek the leadership of the Holy Ghost and everything that we do a man if he died for all of our sickness then we are sick we all laying down upon the cross you say Lord deliver me and not have rest until he has came and given the answer in our mortal bodies amen he said in Zechariah I will be a wall of fire around about her amen he told he told the young man go measure Jerusalem what do you see I see a man with a measuring line in his hand he said go and measure Jerusalem he told the angel they wouldn't measure to how deep it was how wide it was how high it was he says I know exactly everybody that will be inside Jerusalem I know exactly everybody will be outside Jerusalem and I will be a wall of fire around about you Amen my brother BAM says is that sin didn't come into you you went out to it amen stay down on the inside amen amen he the dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High God shall abide underneath the shadow of the Almighty amen and how easily we would give that up to have our conscience seared for the sins that we allow and our moral being amen Christ's death was worth more than that st. amen it really was it was worth more than that a man Christ deserves better than what we give him amen he deserves a lot better than what we give them amen every man that seeks a bride deserves to have a bride that would seek his best and we ought to seek Christ best in our lives amen amen by the by the the habits that we form in life amen by the the well beaten path to the place of Prayer by the people that we associate with the people that we have to disassociate with are the things we decide we're not going to watch amen because we want to keep the campground holy amen we want to keep the throne-room we were going to protect the place where God's Word dwells bless the a chance we'd be guilty like E of letting the word of God be in danger of falling upon the ground amen they that come and enquire should I be inquired of by the men that keeps the stumbling block of iniquity before my face I will not be inquiring I when I answer them I'll answer them according to their own iniquities and when God answers you according to your sins and iniquities it's an answer of judgment and not a peace amen [Music] amen because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge and the Most High thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling place for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou shalt - like foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion in the adder the snake and the young lion and the dragon shall trample under feet because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I'll set him on high because he hath known my name amen he shall call upon me and I'll answer him I will be with him in trouble and will deliver him and honor him with long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation amen but how can we seek the promises of the Most High God with a stumbling-block of iniquity before our face Amen we we know the steps of what Christ is looking for in this hour but but how to do them amen amen God says my holy place is called by my name shall be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of thieves amen you know in in the case of when the book of Acts when when the man and his wife they everybody was giving selling all that they had and giving it to the church so they might have all things in common the man his wife they they decided that they sell all that they had and they kept back a part of it for themselves amen and and and and what they did is the new one came and they they lied unto Paul they thought they were lying to Paul and they came and Paul asked him you know is this all that it was from from the sale of your things and and or I mean it wasn't Paul that sorry the disciples there and they said yes the man said yes that is all and and the in Peter said you know you you why did you seek in your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost you have not lied on demand that you've lied and to go and then when his wife came into that he fell down dead and then when his wife came into the house she came in and st. Peter asked her he said is this all you know from the sale your things and she says yes this is all and he says why is it that you have conspired together with your husband to lie into the Holy Ghost you have not lied unto men but you have lied unto God amen when we go bet and bat get go into the waters of baptized and declare that we are going to be separate from the things of the world and alive under the things of Christ and then we day after day will not repent of our sins we are not lying under the men but we lied unto God by bearing false witness of our baptism amen where we said that we would be separate from the things of the world but yet we come into the house and inquire before the Prophet but yet we have the stumbling block of iniquity before our face amen and we wish that God would answer us when our consciousnesses I've been seared as with the hot iron amen let's fear of the Hebrews chapter 6 amen verse 4 says 4 is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Holy gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drink thin the rain cometh that cometh off upon it and bring his forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth the blessing from God but that which Bharath thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things which accompanies salvation though we thus speak for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and your labor of love but you showed toward his name and then you have ministered to the Saints and do minister and we do desire we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen stern warning Paul says there are people they will fall away after tasting all the good things of God they will fall away and they will take the Holy Ghost and drag it through the mud again and through all the gifts so he gives them gift after gift after gift yet they take that and they will not and they bring Christ to an open shame he says but we're persuaded better things of you and things that company salvation even though we're talking this way for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love that tells me this is the time for repentance there's still a chance amen there's still a hope a MEF it would be that we would go back and say Lord I'm coming back to my baptism I'm coming back to what I testified of in the waters that would be alive under the things of Christ and dad do things in the world a man otherwise why are we here and otherwise why are we come for me better if we had never heard the gospel then if we come to the gospel and refuse to walk in amen a man let's let's just stand [Music] Ezekiel 14 verse 6 says therefore say into the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God repent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn your faces from all your abominations for everyone in the house of Israel or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel as the Gentiles which separate himself from me and setteth up his idols in his heart and put the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and cometh to a prophet not to the prophet but just to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me I the Lord will answer him by myself and I'll set my face against that man I'll make him a sign in a proverb and I'll cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that I am the Lord amen let's just power hasn't word prayer heavenly father I just pray father for myself and for everybody in this place Lord Lord a stern message father the Lord if I be guilty if any must be guilty Lord and I think we all know where we are guilty for your you Lord have not been slow to convict us of our sins father or but you Lord have been faithful father to remind us of the things we have done that a contrary to our work I don't think that any man can rightfully say that I do not know what I have done wrong or that cannot look down into his heart and find things that are contrary to the gospel the Lord I pray father that we would be quick Laure to repent father that we would not give chance father - to our souls being seared with a hot iron that our conscience would no longer work and doing the thing that it is designed to do that our conscience is there to lead us into repentance by God's direction but Lord if we allow damage to come to our conscience Oh Lord how can we repent and lord I just pray father that you would right now restore father the conscience 'as of men father or that through the tears father of those that cannot cry for their sins father that they would their tears would be restored to them father Florida that those are have hardened their heart that somehow you had softened their heart that once more they could be broken for their sins sake Lord there once more they could find themselves at an altar weeping and crying out for Lord how long they have allowed the stumbling block of iniquity staying in front of their face Wally while they inquired about your prophets message Lord but O God we ask your father you'd give these a chance father awhile mercy and grace is upon upon the altar Lord and while you were there to make intercession for us upon our confession father that we would confess to you Lord that we have sinned and and done against the the grace of the Almighty God and we have counted you or we we have done despite to the grace of God Lord and I pray father than us being this guilty father that somehow you would allow us to give us the grace to repent or no man can repent without your leadership father and without your conviction father so I just pray for these people now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you would have mercy upon them father and grant them this great repentance father not Lord we don't want a halfway repentance we don't want a partial repentance father but we want a true godly sorrow Lord repent after a godly sorrow Lord that would be a truth there would be to be accepted on your sight father though we could go on Lord of bonds life's journey being joyful not in the burdens of our iniquities the stumbling blocks father but alive unto the Lord Jesus Christ father Lord and casting away the things that do so easily ander us father and as brother Brown said habits our spirits Lord and to reject these spirits of this age father that so easily ensnare the children of men father Laura that we could be the sons of God Lord holding the things there right Lord and rejecting the things that are evil father and we're just asking Lord for mercy father Lord and your mercy is to give us a call repentance father and we thank you for the message tonight Lord night and I just pray Lord that the Lord don't let any of us fail of your mercy and your grace father and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen with a sermon such as that I'm gonna ask our brother Isaac it becomes sing a couple songs we will open up the altar for prayer amen I think may desire prayer I'm willing to pray for you but more than anything we need to seek his face and repent of anything that we have that is contrary to the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ [Music]
