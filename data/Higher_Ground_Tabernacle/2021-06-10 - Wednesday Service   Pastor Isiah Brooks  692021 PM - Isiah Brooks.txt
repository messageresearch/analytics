came and just gave me a piece now i say that just to say that but getting ready and everything usually when i have to go with brother brooks the day before or a couple days before i can't eat a drink because i don't want to go to the restaurant but it's like my whole body on the inside just runs and i be real nervous and so but this time i had no nervousness and it just seemed as though god was just leading me and just taking me through this and um and i appreciate all your prayers because i know this was what's helping me as well and so anyway so we got ready we went to the airport and everything and as we got on the plane and stuff we got there and i'm like okay lord i was just praying and the lord it was so amazing because even we got there uh [Music] my supernatural book just started reading and the lord blessed me through that and then so but it was a little rough ride and then the thing was i went to the doctor to get some medicine to kind of calm me down but the lord said do not take it so i didn't take the medicine and he took me all the way through from chicago to uh i mean from chicago like i said it was a little bumpy but the lord took me through so then we got to uh jacksonville [Music] you know the enemy still trying to fight and i'm like why are you doing this you know it's not kind of like so i kept reading my book and everything and i came to a spot in one of my books um where i was reading where uh brother brown was going to his breakfast and uh these men the lord had told him that the [Music] [Music] again and it's just like it just went and then i had no worries even though we had the bump bumps or whatever it was it didn't like oh whatever but i was holding brother brooke's hand and i did squeeze every now and then he said it's okay it's okay okay then i just prayed but god took me through and it's just a supernatural trip that this has happened and i just praise god and thank god for all his goodness and all his love toward me

this mercy we're going to just go right on into the word of the lord thank you musicians thank you all god is good to us um appreciate everybody's patience with me love the lord amen we had a wonderful time there in st augustine and i guess i'm wearing st augustine with me because i brought some some food back with me but it's not on the plate it's on me [Laughter] but we thank god for his goodness thank the lord for my wife called with us it was just a lovely time in jesus and uh satan fought the whole entire time but god got the victory uh many people were really really blessed and revived the church in itself had been going through some tremendous battles and of course god intervened by word of the past and his wife and a young lady who we prayed for which was the pastor's daughter the lord really touched her and just various things different things did happen in spite of all the things satan tried to do i mean he tried to mess with the mics i mean everything was just but god came through i really thank you for your prayers amen as we turn stand let us turn to revelations 22 revelations 22 i apologize for coming in late i was in my mind i'm thinking that service started at 7 30. and then when i heard brother frank speaking i was singing i'm like wait a minute and i still had to think on it before it really clicked but uh we appreciate the lord jesus amen revelations 22 and from there we're going to go to genesis the second chapter and the eighth verse um i think i think the thing that we must realize tonight is that identity means a lot you know who are you know where you come from it's it's never it has been about uh us or we in the gentile selection it has always been individuals and so tonight we we all must come to see who we really are one of the scriptures that really really uh unfolded to me the other day was who shall lay any charge to god's elect it is god who justified i have seen a lot of scriptures i've seen a lot of things but that seemed to was magnified in my spirit by by the holy ghost revelations 22 and two in the midst of the streets of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear 12 manners of fruit watch this and yielded her fruit every month the alpha becomes the omega and remember everything must be fulfilled nothing shall come back void and what eve did not do god chose the bride of this day to fulfill even as it was was the with the first adam he did not do what god intended him to do is to and that was to replenish the earth with sons of god not with sons of adam so let's go to genesis 2 and 8. when we come to see that we are trees how many all know we we're trees i think it was psalms the first chapter where david says i'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water by the river one water amen and i'm glad to know that we uh as the people of god uh really has nothing to do with it sometimes we we feel like we ought to have something to do with it but i believe that if we take hands off and let go and let god we'll grow and mature at a faster rate genesis 2 and 8 and the lord god planted a garden east within eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden in the tree of knowledge of good and evil let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for uh being our all in all and lord tonight we realize that there's nothing within our powers nothing that we can do of ourselves but we are definitely depending on you to break the word of life to us lord bless us now forgive us of our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness lord we realize tonight the devil is a liar and how he tried to influence our minds with his thoughts and his ideas and lord i reject those thoughts i refuse those thoughts and i say tonight lord by your grace and your mercy let your mind be in me the mind that was in christ jesus lord we receive it in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be see that i know that uh we've been just kind of preaching on a lot of things but uh one of the things that i well not just one of the things the things that i'm really trying to get everybody to really see especially among the bride people is to see who you really are you know you know because if you can't see who you are um it's like a blind man he doesn't know which direction to go in and so we just trust by the grace of god that the bible in itself become amen your absolute the word of god that is meant to be lived not to be preached or or quoted but to live because remember satan can do a little quoting himself uh so we realize that the power of life is not in quoting god the power of of the scripture is living can i say it like living god yeah not a living god but living god amen letting god live through us and you know brother branham talks about threefold purpose a threefold purpose that god had uh in in his thoughts when he were to create all things and and this this could be uh found in christ the mystery of god revealed he said his this his threefold purpose was to express himself identify himself with human beings and to reveal himself in christ and in in when in reading that it may seems like it's not much but what good is it to profess christ if you don't know him and to understand this is that he his is one of his purposes one of the purpose of his purposes is to identify himself and you know even throughout the word he he constantly uh said even to israel i the lord thy god is one i'm a god that changes not and in another place he said if there is another god i don't know him and then you know i could see how israel in the intellect would be confused about that especially if they knew those scriptures and jesus there in saint john 10 30 says i and the father are one i can see how they would get really upset and think he is a blasphemer but one of the things that jesus told us is that the the the understanding of god does not come uh by intellect it comes by way of revelation you know you could have two three four five six whatever so many people in the service and you a man could be preaching in the bible the word could be coming with such a power and authority and and one man or two men or however would go out saying oh man wasn't nothing to that but then there's another little group of people that could hear it and could understand it and would leave out rejoicing praise god god met us in a mighty way that's how it is with the message even though it's laid out on tapes he's laid out in on books and you know laid out in the bible there's still those people who have so-called walked with him and have not yet known him the purpose of this bible and the purpose of god creating things is for his creation to come to know him it is a beautiful thing that god so loved us as the scripture said that he sent his only begotten son and in that scripture it was christ coming to to into the in the form of a human being to reveal himself and you know that's why jesus being the body of christ never sought to take credit for anything and he says i can't do nothing except the father showed me in other words he says it's not i that do the works but my father that is within me or he you know he is the one he's doing the work and that's how it is with the true christian brother of adam said as i think in christ's mystery god revealed again he says a true uh uh a mountain transfiguration experience will always glorify god or jesus christ well always he said it won't glorify moses he will not glorify elijah he will only glorify jesus christ now when you quote that particular quote you find out that people get really upset and uptight about that because often time the name of jesus christ become secondary to the name of elijah in the name moses but you and i must understand that the name of jesus christ in order to fulfill the purpose of god that name must be exalted because the bible says neither is there salvation in any other there is no other name given to my man under heaven above heaven around heaven no no no no no there is no other name given among men under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ see that's god's purpose his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family i like that because there's nothing more beautiful than to see a beautiful family where the children are in order and the daddy and the mother and everybody is just in in such a beautiful order now you know it's a rarity it's a scarce thing but i've seen it with my own eyes and you know it's what we all crave for as christians fathers and mothers you know we all crave children we all crave that desire for all of us to be on one accord and to be a family because we know that when that is is on display it is a reflection of god's thoughts his will think about it had not adam and eve sin how beautiful it would have been we don't know how many of children they would have had but it would have been this i would say like this inexhaustible of the number you know like like john says i i there was a number that no man could could count beyond counting innumerable as the scripture calls it and that still that still stands it may not have come through the first adam and eve but definitely it comes through the second see that purpose was to to his family or earthly family adam and even and the only way they could be one with the family or with god because god nurtured excuse nature was in them so um understand it's every time i think about the garden of eden and the tree of life i think about it in a different way now because you got to realize that everything was male and female the animals the insects the bees you know uh the trees everything male and female and you know many people still don't know that trees comes in male and female and of course this is where you get pollination bees coming from one tree to the next amen to pollenize them and you look at these things and you think to yourself what a horrible thing that eve allowed to happen to her she was of a different tree she was not of the same tree of the serpent and i could see how the the hibernation came in and i can see what happened to adam being that he was the one who who carried the life we have no idea how god suffered that to happen but no doubt the pain of disappointment that it brought with that action but in the midst of it all god still had mercy because in god's mind he knew that was the only way that he could reproduce himself in the way that he wanted to even though it looked faulty it was really the perfect way because you don't know what perfection he is until you see imperfection and we have had over 6 000 years of imperfection and i think there's a group of people around here that wants to really see perfection so we want to be the family of god and we can't even imagine within our minds what that's going to be like but understand your purpose for being a christian is not to express yourself it is to express him it is to let go and let god express himself through you right and we must understand that is the identity the identity of a christian is not the brand of religion it's not the baptist methodist presbyterian pentecostal or even that's not christianity christianity is when the life of christ is living through that individual so much so that it can be identified is that right they knew that they were they were christians at antioch they even called them christians why because the life of christ was identified in them even though jesus christ in the natural had already gone off the earth his life was now being exemplified through them and when those people saw them they didn't have to put a sign or cross or anything on their backs around their necks it was the very life the very character of christ living through them and so they felt they were fulfilling they were fulfilling the word of god that was allotted for them think about it amen right and so we see that was god's family because his nature was in them you don't have to worry about a lamb being a goat because the nature is not there as long as that nature of the lamb is in the lamb that's all it can be it can't be no more and it can't be no less it'll never bark it'll never meow like a cat because that is not the nature of a lamb it will be submissive it will be a follower instead of a leader needs a shepherd and it's amazing how sometimes people feel like they don't need one but then that lamb needs a shepherd because he's not smart enough to lead himself and a true christian needs to shepherd the lord jesus christ because we're not smart enough to lead ourselves amen so we know that god made them with god's nature in them then with each other and god they become all one isn't that a beautiful picture god in his family father over also right supreme think about it and that day is coming when we'll see no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have hearty headaches just one with god think about it we cannot even fathom it but i'm gonna tell you something the suffering of this world cannot even be compared to the glory for which god is in store for us only a foolish man would choose this over what god has offered hallelujah you know it makes no sense to me but when we think about us and this is what we must oh i heard somebody say something today uh by way of a tape which was so so so so so so good he said you always should remind yourself of the scripture you should always your scripture like ye are the temple of god that that should always be before you he said because the moment you forget that a lying demon is going to come anoint you and torment you it's the truth we must always try to keep this is why the bible told israel said put it on your forehead around your anchors around you you know whatever do write it everywhere don't forget it and see that's where we come short because most i won't say all of us most of us we don't read or study and we don't meditate or even try to learn the scriptures as they should be learned right but remember in the old in the time of the old testament they had to learn that scripture and they couldn't deviate from it not one eye order right right and so you've got to understand those pharisees that we as we call them in that day i mean they could just almost be uh a man could actually take a pen or whatever and stick it in the stroll and they could tell that person exactly what was written there without even opening up the scroll now that's real teaching that's real learning but let's go on by the grace of god the bible says know ye not that you are the temple of god hmm and the spirit of god dwelleth in you how many of us forget that at times come on now we realize by god's grace we do because our action proves we do right so saint john amen 17 21 says and the glory which thou gaveth me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one now you think about it the same glory the father gave christ what was that himself there is no greater glory than christ hallelujah the greatest thing that god could ever give you is himself hallelujah and that's what he did listen to the elementary file the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which ye are the temple now we we were talking about this today how that sometimes we do things and we do things amen called iniquity you know it wrong and you do it any way and thank god for his grace and the blood of jesus christ that that that that was his blood was shed for all iniquity now let me tell you something no man no woman can love you like that we can love each other but no man and no woman can love you like that hallelujah think about it and that's why i was saying you know we we didn't know what god was doing and israel didn't know what god was doing but you know what israel when they were protecting the word and they were the levites and they were carrying that ark on their hearts above their hearts and you know in the in that holy place and the ark of the covenant and they you know you think about that and you think you know this is this is what i what i saw because i thought lord i've seen this done so many times in those old movies these ancient movies where you got the egyptians or you got these royal people and and they always have somebody carrying them they didn't have wheels they had human beings and those people who were the barriers always carried above their hearts or on the left side where the heart is and i thought listen the whole time we had no idea what was behind that curtain we didn't know but it was a hidden thing it was a mystery and the whole of israel didn't even know what it was and you think about it that even the priests even the high priest they didn't have an idea of what it was all they knew it was holy and it represented god hallelujah but it was a powerful revelation behind that it was more than what they were seeing on the outer court there they were slaying the animals and and and washing the animals and and you know people were confessing their sins but in that hole he's a holiest that was the finished work that was a very sim it was a symbolic of the real blood of christ it was it was the symbolism of jesus himself and understand if you want to put it this way god being a morphing it's the same thing it was a tree of life in a different form it was god in a different form hello listen i don't care what shadow type it is it still must come back to god it can't be nothing else hallelujah and then you got this moses and elijah look at the scripture there stood there amen i think it was uh ezekiel or zechariah moses and elijah standing there those two those two angels and there was a tree in the midst of them and you think about what in the world is going on here god was covering and protecting his bride you didn't know what it was and neither did i but you said well how can you say such a thing as that brother brooks well let me ask you a question when the veil was rent what was behind there nothing not even the ark it was gone where was it jesus it had switched positions it was no longer uh where uh you know upon the furniture that moses built under the inspiration of god but now god had chosen a different tabernacle it was no longer with that with the sheepskin and the ghost skin and all of that stuff no this was now a living tabernacle the bible said in christ was the fullness in jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily hallelujah the very god that once sit on that mercy seat is now sitting on a different mercy seat which we call jesus right and so we realized by god's grace amen when that was done away with we saw the real image of what that represented [Laughter] body soul body spirit and soul however we want to say it but there was jesus christ the very god that that was in the wilderness hallelujah the rock that moses smote and spoke to that was him hallelujah the bread that came down from heaven that was him he's god in murphy he can change into whatever he wants to change into and even though he changes his character never changes hallelujah i used to wonder about that tree in the garden and that tree in revelation because here the tree in the garden doesn't say nothing about bringing forth fruit but in the tree according to revelation the same tree of life is described as a her a she the bride she brings forth fruit hallelujah it has to be her she's the only one that's compatible god again i tell you what it's powerful because when jesus was the tree of life you know there had to be another one and to be honest with you adam and eve represented that until he fell and adam fell and then brother brandon said she no longer represented the tree of life she represented the tree of death that's it by because you know from point from that point on we came into the world being born of that tree hallelujah amen and and and the bible says a man born of a woman it's a few days and full of trouble we came in with death we know we're opponent to die that's the bible says born of a woman and appointed to die hallelujah why because of eve but there must be another tree there must be a woman who can bring forth life that's why god bypassed all those people and the bible said that the woman according to things isaiah would surpass the woman a woman would surpass a man and you know women preachers uses that scripture like you know they're going to be they're going to be a greater preacher than the man that ain't what it means that means that god was going to use a virgin surpass the man god was going to use a woman and not the man to bring forth life and that's what he did hallelujah and so now you say well if that god used mary to bring forth life it was a spoken word in her womb hallelujah what is it with the bride it is the spoken word in her womb she brings forth life all she got to do it says be it unto me according to that word excuse me isaiah 53 8-10 said he was taken from prison and judgment you see that's why brother brown said he could have been married he could have had children he could have done a lot of things but the bible tells us that he sanctified himself right so that we can be sanctified so he chose not those things because his kingdom was not of this world is that what he said he said my kingdom is not of this world he was still living when he said that so if he was to be a king of a different world he must bring up forth a people of a different world that's why he's in being we are in the world but not of the world we come from a different world if there be any aliens we're the aliens he was taken i love the scripture from prison and judgment what did they say i find no fault and who shall declare his generation i've read this before but now if jesus was cut off like abel was cut off there was no genealogy of abel because he didn't have any children and so the devil thought if i can cut jesus off it'll be like cutting off another able he won't have no way to reproduce himself but what he did not know is that this second atom was different from the first the first atom was earthly but this adam was heavenly he said the bible says not only that he was a quickening spirit and he was lord of heaven and her he the bible said if the princes of this world would have known who he was they would not have crucified him hallelujah god was getting ready to do a great thing hiding it from him right so you see by god's grace god comes along and and even i said say he's going to be cut off that's what he said for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth that represented us he paid the price don't you understand if you are accepted in the beloved this scripture applies to you because you were in him when he did it yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed hallelujah and we didn't know but the bible tells us that even in the beginning before the foundation of the world there was a good sower and a bad sower god sold his seed before the foundation of the world hallelujah and because he saw the seed we are now living today hallelujah but see what people don't understand is that it goes back to the original way god intended because we're not given birth by a woman we're giving birth by a he we are born of jesus christ the way it was supposed to be by the adam the man adam yes before eve ever came into play before we ever knew she existed adam was given the order be fruitful and multiply is that all right so we come in this place you say well brothers what are you trying to say i i know one thing that in order to be compatible to the tree of life you must be the tree of life and there's only one tree and that tree is male and female it really is the bible declares it is because the man there is no man can bring forth fruit only christ can bring forth fruit and the woman amen it's the part of her and this is why brother branham said it like this he said she became him now it doesn't mean that she changed her her makeup her anatomy those things remain but the christ in her really has no gender there is no gender when christ that's why it says there's neither male nor female [Laughter] when you are in christ but understand the woman because she is the church she's labeled as a woman and she gets his nature right now he wanted to reveal himself he wanted to contact them to know let them know who he he was i'm a man but yet he's still i'm god he wanted them to know how he loved them for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he wanted them to know that but most of all he wanted to reveal himself in christ now that's saying a lot of things you say well what do you mean brother brooks when brother branham was talking about how those squirrels were created and things like that and hattie wright says that ain't nothing but the truth brother branham he was revealing himself now she knew him as a prophet but now she's going to know him as christ the anointing and he said and now naughty said to brother branham whatever she asked for give it to her you understand me he wants you to know him as christ he wants you to know him as the invisible god but when there's honor given to his to him you must give that honor to the name of jesus christ that's what people don't understand i think sometimes people are afraid of the anointing but it is the anointing that destroys the yokes it is the devil that torments us or try to torment us every day in our mind y'all know it's the truth every day he tries to tell me that's what the devil means a tormentor and that's what he come for to make you think lesser of the word the word is god but he'll come against the word in his own little demonic way to make you think less is that the word the bible says with his stripes we are healed not going to be we are healed but he'll take his little his little uh i call it witchcraft he'll take his little witchcraft stuff and make you feel smell taste whatever stuff that has nothing to do with the word i was telling somebody that over the phone from florida today i said you know what people have a problem with just believing the word we do too much thinking we do too much reasoning god didn't ask us to do anything like that he just asked us to take the word believe it and run with it you don't have to figure it out it's none of your business once you believe it it's god's business but we got to see this happen the temperature has to go down or something gotta you know swelling got to go down and that's nonsense that's not even the dimension we're supposed to work in huh our dimension is not the third fourth or fifth dimension our dimension is the sixth dimension under the altar where the power of god is sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus there's no failure in god but we'll do that to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and have set down with my father in his throne now jesus said he overcame and he's sitting in the throne with the with the father and this is what i try to tell people the throne must also be a place not necessarily a chair because let me ask you a question so y'all gonna think i'm crazy how many you think could sit in that chair but in our minds because we say throne when did when let me ask you a question we did not know in my father's house there are many mentions and if it wasn't so i wouldn't have told you brother banham said they had that wrong see what we we must understand it takes a revelation of the word to bring to us what it really is you know we said oh jesus is sitting on the right hand of god he said there is no right hand it's authority but he has to give it to us so that we can understand what he's saying we talk about the throne room that's where the bride is but it gives us something a picture of something so that we can see what it's like and what it is yes the bible said he said in this story as he was in his throne so when god was in christ he was the bible said the fullness of god was in him and what was god what was jesus at that time he was the very throne room of god that's what he was we said oh we want the throne where the throne room is your heart royalty deity that's why the holies of holies had to be deity it was gold everything was gold that was the throne room your heart is where god wants to sit it is where he wants to rule i'm not saying there's not a place in heaven but that's not what he's constantly he's trying to get you to see let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven let the throne room be here not there hallelujah think about it even according to revelation chapter 4 2 in jeffersonville 61 he says now the first throne was in heaven and that was the judgment seat the second throne was in in in in uh in christ the third throne is is a is in a man that's what he said the third throne you're the throne god in you hallelujah amen we don't need the levites to carry us around now we're the walking epistle we're the walking word amen now i'm not saying they're not they're not dimensions amen when you have chairs because brother branham saw his chair brother saw his dog brother horse brother and saw a house i'm not saying those things don't exist but what i'm trying to say is when it comes to the word of god he's trying to show you that the the the the thing that moses uh designed or saw in heaven was not just that it was you the makeup of a man the outer core the inner court and the holies of holies showed us that through all of this how we come to god because we're filthy hallelujah and we needed a priest hallelujah not only just to slay the sacrifice and and all his shade of blood and you had to laugh with that excuse me the washing and all of those things but all of that was law all of that was just something to give us an idea and israel never caught it even though they performed those acts for hundreds of years they never had the revelation of what it was and even when jesus christ came as god himself walking in flesh they still did not see the word they didn't have a revelation now if they didn't have the revelation of the man how can they have a revelation of the things that he said in order he told them he said now if you love abraham you'll love me because before abraham was i am not like that would have just did something to them but it was the natural veil that hid him from them like it is now is this veil this thing that looks so faulty it's this veil it means that hide god from the people today always will you think about the mighty things that william branham you know god did through him and the people's eyes were still blind why because god had already placed it in the word that she would be blind and naked and don't even know it people of god we're more than just animals we're more than just human beings god has placed us into a position to become just like him in the very image and likeness of god hallelujah we're not elohim per se but we were with him we were his attributes hallelujah yes sir think about it oh if we could just see this great plan of god the way it really is and where god has taken us mighty revelation says to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i have also came overcame and sat down with my father in his throne hallelujah now i don't know how it's all designed but i want to say it like this when you talk my brother brown said like this he said when it's all over you'll have the pillow fire above jesus then below jesus you'll have the bride that same pill of fire will be over the head of our lord jesus christ hallelujah and the bible says we won't even have no need for the sun because the lamb is the light or illuminated they're going to do more than just shine brother all i know is can you imagine there's nothing as bright as white as when that light is hitting my god isaiah saw it at the end of the day you know what you got husband and wife all over husband and wife husband and wife and their offspring blood related you understand me when god showed me the real reason why cain could not be accepted i'm like that's right blood related blood was the issue in the beginning blood and no matter how the serpents want to be that's the word that's what jesus says jesus said you don't even have a place of repentance i can appreciate you all day and there'll still be no repent no no place for repentance it's not in your dna to do so but you get a real saint a man or sister god whoever amen listen they repent god knows how to make them even when they feel like they want to be a little if bashful is shy or stubborn god knows how to put it right and so that's how god is one thing about a true seed of god they know how to repent and they know how to confess they're not like cain and i ain't they're not even like the way adam did it they passed the book um but when you come to a place and says lord it's me as me standing in the kneel of prayer let's move on he says now the third throne is in the man one two three y'all believe that oh ye are the temple of god that's that's it and we must come to recognize that listen people of god i don't understand i really do not understand but god knows you look how god protected brother branham from so many things and yet instead we're the bride and he let us do all kind you know so many things happening so many things were done this way it you know because you know what it's just amazing it amazes me how god in his in his way of doing things take a people of no value and make some valuable i don't understand it but he does i'm not going to be too much longer now he says aj 54 says for thy maker is dying husband i love that scripture the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel now that's exactly who boaz was boaz wasn't ruth's husband he was also her redeemer now he wasn't a maker but he was a shadow in the title of christ jesus christ and think about this woman i think about i think about ruth sometime and it never gives a description of her life while she was in moab but we know the more about his people were not a good people and yet this woman become famous she literally is placed into the the hall of fame of god think about a woman i say that respect with respect because ruth and esther is the only one that has books you had great women of god throughout the whole bible but ruth and esther because the whole revelation of redemption is centered around those two everything the jews ever preached has to do with esther from the law all the way up to redemption and then you get ruth you know you look at her and she's like what god wrote about the gentile world one is jewish the other was gentile and god shows how a gentile bride becomes queen royalty hallelujah for the lord have called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou was refused said the lord for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee talking about amazing grace i was saying the other day you and i must understand we were born fighters yes god said to israel i have given you this land this is your land this is your land you got to fight for it even though i've given you the victory over everything this flesh can bring to you you still got to fight for it but the bible said every inch for every inch you got to fight for it do you really think that this old flesh is going to just lay down to you you got to fight and paul said i kill it every day i make sure he's dead every day because just as soon as i'm resurrected he's resurrected when i wake up he wakes up oh you got to fight people you know you got all of those ice in the in the in the um in in in the land and you got to destroy them all you can't just be buddy with them because uh the bible said have no fellowship with darkness and understand there are spirits amen that's going to anoint this flesh and anoint your mind somebody i think oh my god who it was we were talking the other day and we were talking about the greatest battle to ever fall into your mind in your mind i'm like that's it it started with the mind it must end with the mind you you we lost the battle first in the mind now we must win the battle in the mind it's when you come to know that you know good and evil and i'm gonna close with this this uh this particular scripture the bible says either make the tree good or make it evil god ain't taking a tree that's mixed you understand me make it good or make it evil bitter water can't come and sweet water can't come out of the same fountain it's got to be either good or evil and that applies to all of us tonight all of us and the truth of the matter is you say well lord how can i make it good let me tell you something hagar was not even a part of the original promise hagar came in because abraham messed up and when you think about it god told abraham to obey to do what sarah says right it wasn't the original plan it wasn't what god uh uh uh you know his promise wasn't going to come through hagar but that was sarah's thing and that's exactly what we do that's why you can't have two husbands one got to be dead and that's that's that's what what did god do he allowed the hagar ishmael to come in to show you that throughout your entire life ishmael and isaac are going to be fighting they're fighting right now even in the natural and as long as you in this house and ishmael is living y'all know your flesh is israel right he's wild he's untapable so you got to kill him right and and there's no compromising with him you the ruler you're the promised son but look what god did to hey god when hagar cried out to god god answered but it's so amazing because god god didn't didn't didn't say okay hey god because you're such an honorable woman you know what he was concerned about her seed hersey and though you know she she was just a bonds woman it was sarah who caused them to do that but yet and still god kept his promises he did and ishmael to this day is the wealthiest perhaps of all nations they got all the oil and all of that that's bishop god kept his promise and if god kept his promise to that seed what about the original what about the real seed of god he kept his promise and i believe i'm so excited i'm excited tonight because i don't know when god is going to move i know he's moving he's already moving but god's getting ready to take us somewhere oh yes his promise is sure and his seed i'm not talking about pentecost it's gonna be i'm talking about bride seed the out the omega seed must be it has to declare the original everybody else has something added to it but this bride will be pure word can you imagine it pure word god himself and flesh all over again it's amazing people say the son of man but brother baby said the bride is the son of man there's a quote now not as directly as i said it but it's there well how can the bride be the son of man because she became him he is the son of man it doesn't mean that god is god god got us amen in a in a way of prophetic uh ministry like brother brethren that ain't what he stopped because when people hear that that's all they think about but understand thou must prophesy again that's all i'm trying to tell you thomas prophesied again eat the book because thou must prophesy again and when it comes to those things that means god is going to speak things through you sometimes he does it anyway and you don't even know it but the point of the the point i'm trying to blame break is that if we don't go up higher which you got to ask lord deliver me israel would have never been delivered if they didn't cry out for it you got to cry out for it people lord i want to be in your image i want to be in your likeness god i feel the pull i feel the pull i believe the word of god we're the sons of god hallelujah i believe i'm the throne of god i believe i'm not a housing of god i want to see you manifest make yourself known through me by way of your word by way of your anointing you know by way of your people however here i am lord and so that we'll understand in closing it doesn't mean that we're going to all be heroes you know what i mean by that it doesn't mean that you're going this is not a one-man show and when you think about the the new testament church you know when they really got a lot of things done is when they join together as one that's when the supernatural showed up you love the lord thank god for his grace let's stand and have a word of prayer that's our song need to prepare to come father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy i know the message was short but i pray lord that something was said that would give the people inside of who we are sometimes they scare people when you word things that seem to be different but you're saying the same thing you're keeping the revelation right within the word of god and lord i know that whether it be the tree of life whether it be the burning bush whether it be a donkey that you had to speak through to to correct baylor you change yourself you manifest yourself in ways how the scripture says we've seen him in the world we've seen him in the light we've seen him in the thunder but now we're seeing him lord in that small still voice oh god i pray lord god that to be merciful to us that we'll be able to see that this whole book testify of you if there is a character it is the character of this bible and the bible's character is you and lord you told us to eat the book because we'll prophesy again that means we'll preach we'll be those who becomes the living word not of noah's day not of luther or wesley day not a pentecostal day but this day with a bride coming to her full adoption when we come to that place lord jesus that you will speak and anoint us whatsoever we say it shall be done even as you did it through malachi 4 i believe god that it is here for the bride no it'll never be an open show but we know lord jesus that the master of the house has come and i pray lord god tonight that you take those little things that we said inspired by you that the people will begin to see and put these things together to see that all of the things that we we know whether it be symbolic or not we know that everything represents you and your bride help us see our place help us to see the position that we're to be in there's so many dimensions of you sometimes you pull a little something from here and pull a little something from there we do have a reality lord that there is a true city we know these things but when it comes to the art of god when it comes to the throne of god is no longer hidden behind the veil carried by the levites it's now in the human heart and i pray father god that the revelation of this will grow to us such a magnitude that we will become one even as you pray that we will be one according to saint john 17. bless us tonight let's hear us tonight open our eyes that we may see your lovely name jesus [Music] father we come before you lord jesus we see the affliction that [Music] lord you said with his stripes hallelujah we are here not tomorrow not yesterday but today we are here lord i speak the revelation of my wife i command it to move out of the out of the way of the word the word of
