grace she's got a double portion of grace thank you Lord Jesus Lord just maybe a broken up message this morning but oh god encourage the people or do you have a double portion of Lord the devil may be fighting people think that oh they've gotten out of even the life of your prophet see that even with the vision God you just forgive us of our liquid evil the times where we may have gotten out of the path or don't loose on Sultan we forget all the things that we think we know Lord Jesus we get all of our reasoning to get all of our own ideas forget all the things that we try to resolve themselves above you O Lord may we just go salt you higher and higher then we just want you first in our lives for Jesus special blessing upon the blessings of the Spirit give him strength of God to guide the flock is more guide him for whatever reason oh but you know mikuni enough isn't fair Lord you're worthy of all praise and worship Lord we just love you Lord we want that we want to step into the vision long live the life Lord that you have shown us that Florida and overcoming life in the hole that never sees defeat boards this bride is joy sword you've given us a difficult Lord to see that you're destined for perfection deep wound up efforts you for but it's only through you that we could [Music] you just love each and every one of you [Music] the world is so-so [Music] my desire let's just raise our haze [Music] my spray [Music] hallelujah [Music] and everybody raise your hand once again has the dear so my school [Music] he's uh [Music] hallelujah whoa sing from your heart you oh my I see are you my speed [Music] you know the Word of God was so old time this morning we thank your brother for yielding to the Holy Spirit it is truly my desire to give God all that I can give him we're all faced with trials temptations troubles we battle every day and some of us all day but we do have one that we can turn to and that is the Lord Jesus Christ I believe with all my heart by God's grace that the Lord is soon to come and I know one thing no unclean thing is going to enter in we can call ourselves bride I mean brother Branham and Satan's heating and I wish you'd go home and listen to that tape Satan's either you should go home and listen to it so you'll know that it's not brother Brooks it's words sometimes we take this message for granted we think God gonna just week at our ignorance he's not the day of God's winking is over you understand and each and every one Bible said this is the house of judgment right here right here this is where you're judged and when you don't like the correction of the word that means you don't like Jesus correcting you amen but the bride of Jesus Christ must realize when you come here things are going to be said to you that your flesh don't like hallelujah amen go listen to that message because brother Balaam said that is the devil's trick to make a lot of Christians believe that they are Christians when they're not I don't want to be fooled or deceived by the devil hallelujah you understand me we're living in the last days I believe that with all of my heart I think your brother you know I don't know what it's going to call us people - what would what it what is going to take to cause people to repent people don't know how to repent anymore they don't know how to feel sorry for their sins they don't know how to cry they don't know the only emotional things they know how to do is when they're eating and having a fun time it's true people just don't know how to do that anymore they they're so hard because unforgiveness unforgiveness will harden your heart like a stone so much so you won't be able to even hear the word of God once it's preached I'm gonna tell you I don't have nothing in my life right now no offenses or anything that I feel like I'm justified in not forgiving because the Bible said if we can't forgive our brothers and sisters God can't forgive you you wasting your time trying to be a Christian God is real I really feel like crying because I realized that the people are not getting it there's so many of you not getting it and you know the worst thing can happen to you is to be left behind to know this message and to be left behind oh my god have mercy think about all of the moments that the Holy Spirit tried to touch you try to reach your heart try to break that hole in your life and you hid you stood there and held it with pride because pride is the thing that would keep us all from making things right with God now I'm just gonna give a moment of silence I want our brother to pray that play that song some more you talk to God we gonna spend this time for prayer right now just now you speak to God in your heart because we're living in the last days and I tell you I can't even explain like the brothers here you see you see something don't know how to explain it but you know it's there and I do not want to get ahead of God I want to be right where God is so that when when that thing turned the corner I want to be able to turn the corner with let's pray all of us in your heart just pray if you can also speak with your lips do it with your lips talk to God just father you will be in that vision you want to be able to step into that vision you want to be part of that vision of the Lord Jesus we see how the world is entered into their vision Satan's inspiration we need the Holy Ghost inspiration the inspiration of this message living in us right now father God have mercy upon us Lord look beyond our fall see our knees break up that fallow ground like my brother said Lord that was you speaking this morning give us grace to forgive our brothers and sisters give us grace nor to forgive ourselves many of us can't even forgive ourselves help us Jesus to overcome the the trap and snares of Satan oh god help us Jesus help us now Lord be merciful to us Lord Jesus we mean to help North this Fellowship me joy oh god this is not a religion this is a live we were the life of the word to live in us know Jesus Jesus [Music] not just just now let the people see this is real Lord we played Church a long time Lord we've been in the message so called a long time but things are unfolding Lord right before her eyes and the people cannot see I could tell Lord forgot you the only one who can open our hearts our eyes of our heart Lord open open our heart [Music] Oh [Music] you for you [Music] desire and I know to were as the dear for the water so my soul [Music] design to nice [Music] I [Music] if they got for the presence of the Lord just have a few announcements and then we'll let let you continue to pray those who need to leave you made starting on this coming Saturday I know Saturday is a holiday there's a good place to learn hard to do we need revival and on Saturdays from 1:00 to 3:00 the church here will be open if I'm not here we'll have someone here but we want to pray we want to pray for revival in this assembly we want this assembly to walk into the vision listening to Satan's eat and I realized that belief is God faith is God unbelief is Satan fear is st. we don't want anything of Satan in us as the Lord spoke to our brother we want to be a shell we want our fullness of God to engulf us all so I'm throwing this out because everybody we want to start our young people's Bible study again in the mornings on Sunday but we need some volunteers who could teach children I would say from 7 to 12 and if there be anything that someone who could help teach the children or the teenagers we welcome you see serving one another is also serving God serving each other brother varlyn said Abraham will always teach his children a lot of our children are not even aware of what's going on and we need to let them know that we need to be prepared and Jesus Christ is the only one that can get us out of this we need to give the children word so they could have something to stand on I just wanted to put that out there any volunteers just get with me let me know and then we'll make some arrangements on setting up Sunday School classes in times you love the Lord [Music] [Music] as a [Music] yes sir we know [Music] I gather [Music] well [Music] I [Music] leave it [Music] big [Music] the [Music] yeah [Music] I want you more than over soon [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
