TRANSCRIPT
========================================
blood now flows through my veins and I who was wretched and fine now can see praise God praise God I'm a child of the king amen how many believe that this morning that we are children of the Most High God hallelujah how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen you know whether Eagles are gathered that's where the carcass is a man the fresh Word of God each and every day hallelujah it never gets old fresh manna each and every day a man whilst we are standing let us open our Bibles to Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen he predestinated us before he even formed the world the prophet of God tells us that we were in his bad part of his mind and we were just made manifest in this day a man let us open to Jeremiah 1 and verse Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations amen but the Lord had blessing to the reading of his hair worried we might take our seats I want to speak on the subject realization of our true identity a man here when we were reading in Ephesians the fourth the first the first chapter he says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and the previous verse a is according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so we were predestinated and the word predestinated means determined beforehand before anything happened you knew you know the answer already hallelujah and when we read in Jeremiah God was telling Jeremiah that before you were formed in your mother's womb I knew thee so before Jeremiah was even born before he was conceived in his mother's womb God already knew him hallelujah it gives us so great a joy to know that before we even came to this earth God had already thought of us he knew we were coming to this earth so whatever we need for this life we know he has provided for us whatever we need for this Christian journey we know he has given it unto us a man because he has predestinated us so it doesn't matter where you think you come from or your background or anything you just have to look at what God says about you amen what he's thought about you are because that's where we came from hallelujah I want to read another scripture in judges chapter 6 from Vesey 11 to 12 it reads and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the media night and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord and it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord that the Lord of that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel we said unto them that say the Lord of that's a the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage I go to verse 11 and there came an angel of the Lord and set under an oak which was in offer that pertain unto Jewish they ibiza right and his son Gideon thrashed wheat by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites we see here that the children of Israel were under bondage from the Midianites they will farm their produce but soon after the harvest the median eyes will just come and get it from them and then take all there they are hard labor and the children of Israel ended up suffering and they were in hunger because they were being troubled by the children of Israel the children of the the Midianites but now God knew he saw that it was high time that that should stop and we go to verse 12 he says and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him this was Gideon in the previous verse and said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor hallelujah so we see Gideon thought he was a farmer he was there in the winepress he had never we don't hear of any history of him going to war we don't have any history of him being a soldier or in the army but here God comes to him and says thou art mighty man of Valor God was revealing to him his true identity his real identity that you are not supposed to be there wailing giddy on you're not supposed to be there hiding away from the Midianites you are supposed to go up and go fight because I made you a mighty man of Valor hallelujah so when Gideon realized his true identity he came he led the children of Israel and he delivered them hallelujah we all know the story he delivered the children of Israel with 300 men only and the Midianites were defeated and God brought victory to the children of Israel through Gideon because it is a man who had realized his true identity hallelujah so he does not matter your past does not determine your identity your past does not determine your destiny hallelujah whatever God says you are that's what you are hallelujah that's what you are supposed to take as your identity not what you think about yourself not what the people around you your environment or circumstances say about you but what God says about you that's your true identity hallelujah so we pray to God this morning that he reveals to us what our identity is we look at David David was was the least in his family we know when the when when the prophet Samuel went to anoint when he was told that he was supposed to anoint the King in the from the house of Jesse he asked the the he asked David's father for for his sons to come to you and all the seven sons came to and Jesse said well then probably he is not there he wasn't even thinking of David so his own father was looking down upon him but God before the foundation of the world he knew that David was supposed to be king he was a shepherd boy he never even went to training we know old David's brothers where were soldiers they were trained in the army and they were in insults army they're fighting the Philistines but David wasn't even there he was even considered he was in the backside of the desert with sheep taking care of sheep and we know there was there was a low job in those days that's what was given to him they said no you you are the youngest useless boy you know you go do that then the man went to war but God didn't see it like that God had ordained him before the foundation of the world that he was supposed to be king hallelujah because he himself he knew his son was going to come and he was going to be the son of David hallelujah amen so we realized that David when he was in the backside of the desert he was just doing his job he didn't know why he was doing but God was preparing him for what he was coming up to you he was preparing him and his eye for his identity for here he really was and we see at first he killed a bear when he tried to come for his arm for some of the sheep and then he thought he was just doing his job but God was preparing him for you for a greater task next comes a lion that comes to try and divor one of his uh sheep the lamps and then he slayed it with a sling he thought he was just protecting the Sheep he thought he was just doing his job but he was building his credentials as a beastslayer because we know the beasts of the fields he had killed a bear a beast of the field next he killed a lion a beast of the field so he was building his credentials after that he knew he knew he was a beast Slayer he slayed all the beasts that would try to come and divor his lambs amen and now when it was high time he was sent by his father to go with food to his brothers in the army then he went with the with the food after he was done when he was heading out he had a voice in the valley and he said what who is defying the name of the Living God and they started telling him the story about this beast called Goliath that's what we use in the modern in the modern terms right somebody who's huge and big and we're told he was a giant so David said we cannot let a man defy the name of the Living God and he remembered that while she was in the backside of the desert he was slaying beasts and this was no different because God had pulled him through it he knew he could pull him through this one amen so it wasn't you it was when he saw Goliath it was just another Beast amen if we read your Bible carefully says he ran towards Goliath he didn't walk because he knew it was a show of victory he realized his true identity his identity was a beasts lair so he went in and he slayed Goliath he had no doubt he was going to get that victory amen because he knew of his credentials he knew of his identity a beasts lair amen so there is no reason why we cannot overcome trials in our lives when you see one trial come your way God has given us the power to go through it God has given us the power to overcome it because it will be preparing you for the next bigger trial that is coming hallelujah we will be building our own credentials to be overcomers hallelujah because every time you come across that temptation you come across a trial maybe a disease you have a headache you pray God heals you you have a stomach ache you pray God heals it you have cancer next time you have cancer you're going to know that my identity is that when I pray for things God will deliver me you know when I pray for diseases God will will make them go away and you to make you realize who you really are amen so every time you come across a trial a temptation know that God has ordained it for you to to overcome it because in first Corinthians we know Paul tells us that whatever trial that comes our way God has already opened a way for us to go to overcome amen he or he has already opened a channel for us to to have victory because he trusts us He is God you know he trusts us that whenever a trial comes away we'll overcome it because he predestinated us before the foundation of the world that we are overcomers so when whatever comes your way know you are over Korean overcome and you can go through it hallelujah we can also read about Shamgar we know he was also in the book of Judges he was also in the same situation as as Gideon and the Prophet talks about Shanga he he dramatizes it they were also in the same situation they would farm their produce wheat and after they harvest this Midianites would come in and then they come and take everything away and then sham go one day he was standing in there in the house he looked at his poor wife she was now thin because they were starving they were living under their privileges he looked at his son he was there starving skinny and probably suffering from kwashiorkor o because the media nights were troubling them whenever they would get their harvest the media nights would just come and take they were doing no work one day he was looking outside the window then he looked at his family he saw this was not a good situation then he saw the media's coming through but then he realized who he was he realized the promise that was given to his forefather Abraham hallelujah that they were a chosen generation they were a chosen people then he realized who he was he just came out he took whatever the closest thing there was an ox god which is not even a weapon and we have no history Derek Shamgar was a was in the military or that he had any military training he took that ox good and he slew all the Midianites because he realized who he really was so you see the devil many times he comes to us and he tries to make us forget our identity because so long we don't realize who we are he will make us to leave under our privileges he will get things trials to trouble us because we just don't know who we are that's why he keeps you from from knowing who you really are Amen if we look at our read in Joshua chapter 2 and this is about when the when the spies were sent to Jericho before they before they encompass did Joshua chapter 2:9 says this is a Rahab and she said unto the man I know that the Lord has given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land fainted because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you come out of Egypt and what she did unto the two kings of the amorite that way on the other side of Jordan Sehun and ark whom he utterly destroyed God had given the children of Israel this promise he said whatever ever you have the soul of your food treads that land I give to you but the children of Israel were scared they were scared to go into fight but the enemy was already scared of them so you see the devil is already more scared of you because the devil knows who you are that's why he tries to make you not know who you are so that he can take advantage of you so do not worry just know your true identity you keep the devil on his feet you keep him running because he is more scared of you than you are amen hallelujah I'll read a quota for the prophet of God say in an exposition of the seven Church ages says now remember this Christ is Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of heads but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm former and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that because you see the devil knows his future that's why he tries to make you forget and not know who you are he finds that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army hallelujah so you and I we have a promise we know we are supposed to be an invincible army but the devil comes to us and whispers that we cannot make it it tries to come and shows you this mistake and he says look at what you have done he shows you your past you know the devil one of the devil's greatest weapons is memory he makes you remember what you did before before you were saved but you see God does not remember seen God does not remember confessed sins the moment you confess it to God he cast it in the sea of forgetfulness hallelujah there are two things that God cannot do he cannot remember your sin and he cannot fail those are the only two gods in abilities amen but he see now the devil now since we're you man we got a memory we can remember our own sins and that's why the devil points to you when you were there when you are so victorious and you are fighting so hard you're having a good time the devil just comes to you like hey you remember five years ago you shouldn't be happy you're not a saint that's why the devil does to us and then you day you remember bleh yeah for sure I'm probably not gonna make it but don't listen to that hallelujah when he tries to show you when the devil tries to show you your past you show him his future amen remain remind him of his future hallelujah that is going to burn in the lake of fire so don't listen to him whenever he comes to you because he knows we're an invincible army so that's why he comes and tries to tell us we will not make it we will not make the rapture but it is not about our own ability it is because God has predestinated us before the foundation of the world so we cannot fail hallelujah it is already done and sealed God will never lose those that eye he's a man so you just know for sure that you're going to make it we are humans we make mistakes like Paul said I die daily but we know a righteous man is one when they fall they get up god says that he says that David was a man after my own heart but we know that David committed a lot of sins then how could he be a man after God's own heart because every time he fell he rose up and he kept on going hallelujah so don't don't despair when you fall down don't remain on the ground get up and keep on going for we are righteous people that's what it means righteous does not mean that you are holier than thou you don't sin we make mistakes but don't let those mistakes draw you back made those mistakes help you next time you think you know that this was I failed this last time around but God please give me strength so that next time I will go through it so that I will not fall into the same trap because we were meant to be overcome as hallelujah we can you can lose a war but you cannot you can lose a battle but you can not lose the war because the war was already won before Amen God already gave us the victory he made us overcome as before we were born he predestinated the war to be won for us so if you lose one war if you lose one battle don't display keep on going you will win the next one because of early we've already made it amen so the devil tries to keep on making us forget who we are he tries to you know to just to take us down and not make us remember who we are because we he knows that we are in trouble to him he knows that the moment we know who we are we will be at destruction to his kingdom amen so we gotta know who we are you know the woman had the world she thought she was a prostitute that's what she thought and that's what she was doing but before the foundation of the world God knew that she was a daughter of God after she met Jesus that day on the at the well and after that light strike on unto the seed that was planted before the foundation of the world and it was and it was ignited that's when she realized her true identity that she was a child of God she was a daughter of God and she ran off into the city and told everyone what she has sin and then her life changed it was no longer the same because she realized that she was not a prostitute but she was a true daughter of God a man look at Mary the one who had seven demons she came to Jesus and started um she she and she washed Jesus filled with her tears and with their hair and anointed them and then Jesus said your sins are forgiven woman all the Pharisees they tried to condemn Jesus for doing that but it was because and they wanted to they were pointing how evil this woman was and all the bad she had done but Jesus he is the only one who can take away our sins amen and he said go sin no more he made the woman realize it through identity and she was a faithful disciple you know she's one of the Mary's who went to to try and go to anoint the body of Jesus after he was buried because she had changed her life was changed after she realized her true identity amen we look the Prophet tells us of the story of aunty Jemima the the woman that was in a Memphis Tennessee she was there and she had a she had a son who had gone in the wrong direction and he was now sick and he was on the bed dying she couldn't she had nothing to do you know and she was praying to God for God to heal his son then she looked into the Bible and she saw the Shunammite woman and then when she looked at the Bible she saw herself she saw her identity she said that is me and she said God I see myself the picture has to be complete but way is the Elijah and she prayed for God to heal her son now that she had realized had true identity this woman she went she prayed and her prayer and have faith with a love for his boy for her son that prayer called a whole aeroplane that was full of people people we had important business meetings probably that we going wherever they were going but God prioritized this woman's prayer because she had realized the identity she looked into the Bible and it was like a mirror she saw herself she said Lord I'm the shunammite woman Lord way is the Elijah and her prayer started looking for Elijah it went around looking for Elijah and Elijah was in the plane and God said somebody has realized their true identity do something the plane has to be grounded the plane was grounded and the Prophet started walking God was talking to the Prophet you know say you go that direction now turn right now turn left it was the prayer of this woman just just a woman not somebody great or whoever but it was just as simple somebody who realized their true identity when they looked into the Bible this pray oh it was like it was like a radar that was directing the Prophet GPS it was telling now you got that way you got that way it was the faith of a woman who realize that true identity and the Prophet says he didn't even pray for the Sun he just saw the faith of the woman and he said you pray and he was just struck but the quality of the fate of this woman amen so when you realize your true identity God will prioritize your prayer amen because he says the the prayer of the righteous man availeth much so it is first class it is first preference when you kneel down to pray and you know who you are God will prioritize a prayer and he will here and not only here but he will hear and answer your prayer amen so we got to know who we are because the devil tries to make us forget and not to know who we are we look at Esther in the Bible she was a queen in the Jewish year King Ahasuerus squid and there in the kingdom and all had people including herself they were at their their lives was at stake so if this decree that Haman was trying to get passed was going to be passed that every Jew should be killed Esther was going to die because she was also a Jew but then she knew she realized her true identity and she said I am a queen I am a queen of this of this country and we know that in those days that King Ahasuerus had had captivated a lot of a lot of different nations and she realized who she was and she got to a point where she said it's a do or die if I don't go I'm going to die anyway but let me try to go I might die but I might not so it was a do-or-die situation and then she went into the king there surprisingly the king was so open to her and he said whatever you want I'll give unto you even half of my kingdom it is because she realized a true identity if she would have just remained timid back there probably in the palace she would have been killed but now because she realized her true identity she ended up destroying her enemy ended up destroying himself because somebody realized their true identity you see now we the devil makes us forget who we are it was because by the way we were born the way we were born and seen and shaped in iniquity the Prophet calls us the prophet of God calls it amnesia the way we're born made us forget where we came from we cannot remember with just with this human mind but before the foundation of the world we were already there on the back part of God's mind now that we are here born and born in sin and shaped in iniquity the devil makes us forget who we really are just like the prodigal son when he left home and he said I want I want my inheritance he took all of it and then he ran oh he ran off after he had spent all of it he was not his mouse he now started eating a pig food that's where he was you know and then he was suffering then after some time he said they and he thought but the servant said my father's house the eating way better than I am and he was they just self reject he had self-rejection and was looking down upon himself but then he remembered that he was a son that he had a father although he had done wrong he was still a son doing run doing wrong doesn't change somebody being a son or the status of being a son you parents you know that when your child does wrong that's not gonna make them you you're not going to disown him because they made wrong amen so their son he said and he remembered and he said but I'm my the servants if at my father's house the eating way better than I am they have better clothing there they're living better and then he said he made up his mind and he said I'm going back to my father's house and when he goes back the Bible says the father saw him from afar so the father was already standing he knew that his son was going to come back someday he knew the son was going to return after he realized who he was that he was a son of his father so he was standing there and he saw from afar he saw the step he said that looks like my son and he knew he was going to come back this is what God done for us when we were born here on this earth we forgot who we are but when we realized who we really were that we we're sons of God when we realized our true identity we started walking and with by the revealing of the word we started coming back to God and God knew that we were going to come back to him whatever we had done that didn't matter because when he died on the cross of Calvary he paid for all of our sins so he paid for the sins that that we did and the ones that we are going to do so he already blotted them out hallelujah and he knew he knew that somehow one day because God never loses any better his so he knew that someday when the word of God was going to be revealed to you you are going to walk back to him and you always welcomes you back with a wide open arms amen we know we all know about the the momma Eagle story amen we told that she had and she had an egg that she couldn't find this farmer picked an egg and egos egg and he put it under a hand amongst the other chicken eggs then this chicken hashed the eggs and then there was one eaglet and the rest were chicken I'm pretty sure when the Eagle was growing up he looked different and they were all making fun of this eaglet they say look at your beak it was crooked crooked like this he couldn't eat properly and they you know he couldn't walk like a chicken and they are telling you but he would the the eaglet was constantly told that you are a chicken but he was always wondering why you know he looked different I believe he thought he had a speech impediment because he was trying to speak like a chicken but he was not designed to speak like that a man because he was built his genes it was genes always eager it gene spelled eager its feathers was eager it had nothing to do with a chicken but all is during all this time it was growing up it was just being told my my chicken was telling it you are a chicken you are a chicken when you see this when you see their birds that are that devar when you see those we run away because we are chickens those birds they pray after us and then this ego I believe he was just wondering why he was different from the rest of them you know he tries to eat they scratch for for worms in the dirt he just just couldn't wondered why his appetite was different it could not then one day mama Eagle knew that she had left an egg and she started going around trying to find it it's its egg that it had laid then she saw something that looked like an eagle and she said that's my son that's what I left and she came looking for the ego and when she came by mama ego tells mama chicken tells its children including the Eagle he says when you see an eagle you run away that's danger because it's coming to kill you so whenever you see an eagle cream or whenever you see an eagle take cover it's bad news for you Amen so this bird carried along its new whenever she whenever this little Eagle head would see Eagles or birds flying it'll you know take cover run away because the life was at stake that's what he had been taught by um by my mama chicken but now this time it was a bit different when Mama Eagles screamed he he heard something it sounded familiar but he had never heard it before because he had grown amongst the chickens he never heard the Eagle scream before but it sounded familiar it was a resounding - what was it with then at a man he looked looked like it looked it looked like itself this ignorant look then mama chicken says everybody take over all the chickens they run away trying to hide then this eaglet I believe he tried to he tried also to run away but something was pulling it you know I felt you know the depot was calling back to the deep a man when this ego will scream you say come up you know it's it was a different language but it could understand it because that's what it was born to be an eager not to be a chicken a man and is trying to run is trying to go take cover but if you know it's just filling this attraction issues just wants to go in here more it's like you know this sounds really good I want to hear more of this then he stopped then it looks up he says no I look like that mama chicken say run hide but then he said no let me hear some more mama ego said come up come up hither but then this Eagles say I've never flown before I don't know how to fly mama eagle said that was it was born within you just open up your wings flap them a little mama this eaglet said okay let me do it opens up his wings flap them up you see ever since in his whole life it had never flown it just knew how to jump probably never more than three feet up that's what you and it was told that what he thought he was but then you know he flapped his little wings then he saw himself rising up mama chicken said come back that's danger you're going to be eaten he thought he says no I'm getting out of here and he kept on going he kept on rising up hallelujah because the depot was calling to the deep he saw that this is what I am he realized his identity he says no I'm not a chicken I am an ego then he kept on going mama he goes say keep on flying and he saw yourself getting up and he says I'm out of here you see me no more I'm not a chicken I am an eagle hallelujah because it realized his true identity that's what we were when we were in the world we don't know why you don't understand why your appetite was different probably your friends you know called you to go smoke to go drink maybe go clubbing you probably did it but he just didn't you just didn't like it he just didn't feel it you know it's like no let's do this you probably did it but he just didn't he just didn't feel right why because before the foundation of the world God chose you to be his children God chose you to be a son God chose you to be a daughter so before you had not realised who you were when you were doing that but when you had the word when the word was revealed to you a man that you had the deep calling to you and you felt like this was it and this is the true ego food hallelujah we don't eat we don't eat worms that we scratch in the dirt now we don't we eat fresh food hallelujah a fresh kill every day hallelujah of the Word of God is all right hey man so when you heard the word however God opened it to you then you see you saw it and you say this is me that's my true identity you didn't you didn't refuse the call the call from God because that's what you really were you thought you always found yourself looking different you know amongst the people you know sometime I used to ask myself why am different but it was because I was an eager I was not a chicken a man so when you realize who you really are you know you want to get that fit you just want to get closer to God because you feel that deep calling to you amen so this dis chuck ins they were trying to put all those Creed's dogmas and habits to this ego but it just it was doing but it just couldn't you know he just couldn't feel it but when the word came that's when it flew back and it went what it was really a man there was an eager amen so that's who really we really are we are Eagles we are not chickens and we are told that the prophet of God says and all that was in God was put into Christ oh that was in Christ was brought into the church so we realized a church is not a building or a gathering of people church is the people can you shake your neighbors hand and say God bless you Church the person who's right next to you that's the church and here we're told that all that was in God was poured into Christ and all that was in Christ was poured into the church which is the person sitting right next to you the person who received the word for their day that is the church hallelujah the Bride of Christ and it's the people amen and also all the creative power that was in God he gave to Christ and that same power he gave it to the church you see so you look at this if you take sea water however trillions and quadrillions of gallons of sea water it's still the same it's still the same water if you take a small spoon of of that sea water and take it home you see that same water has the exact same properties as those trillions of gallons of water has but it's just in a smaller Kwan but it is still the same if you if you ask what's that are you gonna say it's water any teaspoon no it's sea water is it in the sea no it's in a teaspoon but it is the same water that was in the in the in the sea it has the exact same properties if you take chemistry you whatever whatever test you do that you get the exact same result because it is the same it is the same water that's what it is all the power that was in God he poured it into Christ and all the that same power Christ poured it into the church hallelujah because you remember Christ aid may I be one with them as I am one with you because so all the same power the creative power that God said when he said let there be when he created the world that same power lies within you this morning because he poured it into you hallelujah so that's that's who we really are but now with our human minds we fail to comprehend that because we cannot imagine having the same power as God has but now because we are limited in these three dimensions which it's like that same water in the teaspoon because we are in this in this small dimension so we can only exercise it where we where only we are you know where we can reach in these three dimensions so the same amount of water with the same properties in the teaspoon and now the same power that is in God that was that was in God when he poured it into Christ then he interned pour it into the church it is the same power with the same properties just in a diminished quantity because we are humans but that does not mean that power is not creative because we know Christ said if you got faith like as little as a mustard seed you can you can move a mountain and send it into the water why because you have that power because when you realize you a son of God you have that faith and that power is invested in you so you can do it same creative power he had is right in you amen I'll adjust in a smaller quantity so we realized that whatever God had we have it that's why the Bible says we are a mature God's because that same power we have it this morning so do not be scared to exercise that power when you come across situations use that power because you are an amateur god amen revelations 1 and verse 6 it says Jesus is we know that Jesus is the king of kings hallelujah Jesus is the king of kings and he is the high priest of our confession so if he is the king of kings tell me who are the kings because he is the king of kings who are the Kings somebody tell me I'm looking at the Kings right now amen and what do Kings have Kings have authority Kings have power but we know our the power that we have as kings was it was spelled out in acts in Acts chapter 1 when he said you shall receive power the Greek translation calls it authority so you shall raise after you receive the Holy Ghost you will shall have authority that is the power that's being spelled out for our kingdom our our jurisdiction as the Kings hallelujah we have authority we know the prophet of God tells us that when the weakest Christian goes to their knees to pray they're able to shake hell hallelujah why because they have authority because they are a king amen so we are kings and we know that Jesus Christ is our king hallelujah and he is the high priest that will be the high priest of our confession so if he is a high priest it means that they are also priests and revelations once it tells us that we are kings and priests what do priests do priests stand in for one another that's what we ought to do for one another when our when your fellow friend brother sister is in trouble we are supposed to intercede for one another because we are told that we oppressed but we know that Christ is our high priest amen when one of us is in trouble we ought to go on our knees and pray and intercede for our fellow brother for our fellow sister our fellow friend when they are in trouble because that as that is our mandate that is that that is our identity it is spelled out in the Bible we are kings and priests so we have authority what what do we have authority over we have every authority over everything that God created amen because we realize God gave the power to Adam over everything he said men have dominion over everything so adam was king over everything that God had created but he lost that after the fall but we know when Christ went back to the cross of Calvary and He shed his blood he came back as the second Adam and he redeemed that title deed that Adam had lost and he plays it back into the hands of the church amen so you and I we had now have that same power that Adam had but lost so anything that comes in our way we have authority over it any disease that comes our way we have authority over it any trial that comes our way we have authority over it any fear that comes away we have authority over it amen because we are kings we are priests we have that authority that spelled out in Acts chapter 1 verse 8 amen hallelujah so that's who we are we are kings we are priests amen we all heard I believe we all know the story about the the boy little boy who saw himself in the mirror after he you know he visited his relatives I won't dwell much upon it but after he went in front of the mirror he had never seen a mirror before but then he just looked and he said that can't be anyone else that's definitely me anyway he went up and he said I've seen myself that is me but he had never seen himself before why because you see a mirror shows you your true identity a mirror doesn't lie whatever whatever you are that's what you are when you look into a mirror when you see a smudge probably on your cheek but did you say well now maybe I think it's lying I don't have it you remove it why because you know is there a mirror shows you what you are what's really there that's just like what the word of God is to us the word of God when we look into it it's like a mirror we see ourselves you see the Word of God doesn't change somebody if if you are not predestinated that does not change if you are a son of God that does not change and if you are a Cena and was meant to be a sinner that does not change either when you look into use that's white not everybody received the word when you look into it although you were doing wrong you remember you know that I'm a son of God and you strive to get closer to God because you have known who you are when as sinner somebody who is not predestinated to be saved when they look at the word they move further away from God because that's who they are remember somebody was giving him a book of the message and then he read it and then he brought back to the person who read who gave the book and he said my friend the book that you gave me called me a buzzard and he said really but the same book called me an eagle though so that same book the Word of God told somebody else that they were a buzzard and they realized their identity they said oh yeah I'm a buzzard because that's what the book called me but this other person who had received the word when they saw it they saw themselves as an eager everybody looking in the same book looking in the same mirror if they were shown their true identity who they really are so the Bible the Word of God shows you this morning who you really are whenever you have a question whenever you have a problem try and go find in the Bible you will see yourself in there and you will make it manifested amen hallelujah so because we were predestinated to be sons that one change we see in proverbs 23 verse 7 says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and then later on in the New Testament comes and tells us that let the mind ours in Christ be in you and Christ who Christ who was God who became man so you see Christ was God was trying to be man but now so proverbs tells us that as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and we are told that the mind of Christ that was in Christ should be in us so if we start thinking like Christ like how Christ thought and that same way however way we're gonna think that's what we are gonna be Christ was God and if you start thinking like Christ then what do you become can somebody answer me what do you become if you start thinking like Christ amen hallelujah that's what we are supposed to be we are supposed to be a reflection of Jesus Christ when we start thinking like God amen you see we're not when you start thinking like God when you see a problem you don't see it as a trouble you see it as an opportunity to exercise your power when you see a sickness you don't cry you see you start rejoicing you see it as a potential testimony when you see a trial you start looking at it as a potential victory because you are looking at it differently you're not looking at it like somebody who's who's timid you are looking at it like an overcomer because Jesus Christ wasn't overcoming amen hallelujah so you speak however way you think that's how you're gonna speak because Luke 6:45 says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh amen so you should whatever you think of yourself that's how you're gonna be so start thinking like God and you're gonna start seeing your life changing amen every potential problem you will see it as an opportunity to exercise your power and not as a trouble amen so the Bible will see our own reflection it shows us who we really are a man when the Bible says you will you shall be their head and not the tail we look and we say yes amen that is me when the Bible says above and not beneath you look at it you say Amen that is me amen when you are sick and you look at the Bible when it says by my stripes you were healed you look at it and you say that is me Amen hallelujah when I really say they shall drink poisonous stuff and it will not harm them you look at it and you say Amen that is me hallelujah we know that our PO when he was on when they had that shipwreck and they had gone to this island he was here he was bit by a snake but he realized who he was here he remembered he remembered the scripture that said that if if this they shall not be harmed so it just beat him then he remembered it then he said that is me then he shook it off into the fire because he knew who you was hallelujah whenever you have sinned and the devil tries to pull you down you look into the word you say and you and it says that you are forgiven you look at it and you say that is Who I am I know I'm blameless because my accuser the devil has nothing to say God put his right back to him because we know we are justified justified means life you have not even done it in the first place if I see if you come to me and you say apologize for slapping me oh no because I didn't slap you that's what it is I'm not going to accept because I never did it in the first place so that's what God says of all your sins that you have confessed you put it in the sea of forgetfulness and he says that never happened when the devil comes to try and come and accuse and he said he did this this and that God says he never done it in the first place not guilty it is on you devil a man hallelujah when the Bible says we shall perform exploits we look into where and you say that is us amen he says signs and wonders shall follow them that believe we look and we claim it because we look at it into it and we say that is us Amen hallelujah we know we are Gentiles we have that Gentile faith you know the Romans sent Centurion he said he had so much faith he said Jesus you don't have to lay hands just say the word I know when you say it it can be done when we look at into it we know we are Gentiles we say that is us hallelujah we just want the words spoken and we know it can be done when the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivers out of them all which look at it and we say Amen that is us amen and if we when the Bible says we are citizens of the heavenly kingdom we just look and we say Amen because we know that is who we are you see now when Peter Peter knew who he was but before he did he was running away he was hiding and he was rejecting Christ they said we saw you with Christ before and you said I don't know what you're talking about I don't know this man but after Calvary and after he had met God he realized who he was he was now bald and he was now he had realized his true identity and he was healing people he was out there healing people saying silver and gold have I none but what I have I give to you who says that because you realized the authority that he was given by God he realized his true identity amen you see I want to read when the Bible say we are citizens of the heavenly kingdom that makes us so we what that does make us we are not citizens of the earth you see we are ambassadors I read what the prophet of God said it says um why why they have everything that happened owns behind them ah stuff from the top and when and when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that church has the power why they have everything that have been owned behind them their ambassadors of the throne absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ owns belongs to that ambassador and he said go ye into all the world you are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost is come upon you so you can only become an ambassador after you have received the Holy Ghost because that's when you can become a true witness of Christ amen so an ambassador if I am an ambassador from Congo if I commit a crime here the US government can touch me they are not allowed to I have diplomatic immunity if I commit a crime if I run a red light and they want to and they want to prosecute me they have to call the government in Congo and you say your man here did something can you do something about it and then they have to fly me back to Congo that's where they can prosecute me they can't touch me they are not allowed amen because I have diplomatic immunity amen I remember some time ago the devil was working on the earth and he sold job he wanted to afflict him but he didn't have the power so he had to go to God and ask for permission because he couldn't do it hallelujah because job was an ambassador he was representing Christ hallelujah he was representing he was of the heavenlies he was a heavenly citizen that's what we are this morning amen we are ambassadors of heaven we are citizens of the heavenly kingdom so the devil has no right to touch us and he cannot unless God allows it but we know that God only allows it when he he only allows it because he knows we are going to overcome it amen so when you see some come your way you know that God has allowed it because the devil by himself he is not allowed to touch you we are untouchable we are the Bride of Christ amen so when it whatever comes your way you know God has allowed it and has given you he has given you beforehand the power and ability to go through that trial because we are ambassadors of the heavenly kingdom an ambassador represents the whole country when I'm back an ambassador's saved some ambassadors you see they have to be careful what they speak they have to be careful what their words are because you would be quoted whatever word you say that's what your country has said so we ought to be careful of what we are what we are saying because whatever we are saying we are representing the whole heavenly kingdom because we are ambassadors of God amen we should really know who we are amen you know PO for when he went to Paul had the power when he prayed for the sick they were getting healed and people were getting healed when he would walk by they would lay them so that his shadow would just would just heal the people it's because he knew who he was he was not a god but he was the son of God a man he realized his true identity you see when then the sons of Skeever they wanted to pray for somebody else they prayed and they said in the name of Jesus Christ whom Paul preaches this demon say Paul we know Jesus we know but who are you they didn't recognize them they didn't know them so you see when you know your your your identity the whole of Hell they know you they are afraid of you they know that they is so and so because you have realized your true identity and you are representing heaven so they say that these demons refused to get out they say we don't know you everybody you talked about we know about them but we don't know you and they couldn't go so if you don't know who you are then demons also don't know who you are they they won't listen to you but when you realize your true identity you have that power too walk sir comes back you know you can walk and chase every demon that comes in your way every trial that tries to come and stop you you can walk through it because you know who you are amen you see the prophet of God said we are a representation of another world here where we are right now we are representing heaven that's where we really are when he went beyond the curtain of time he came back and he said I saw you there how could he see the people who were seated in the Branham Tabernacle how could he see them there because he saw their body he saw that the open is over there that he said I saw you there so he says we are a representation of another world that's where we really are so here we are being influenced by our theophanies we are not of this world we have a connection with another dimension hallelujah so we are not affected by this we are not affected by environments everything that happens at this earth because that's where we are not really here we are in another place amen the prophet of god tells us the story of this slave was at a slave plantation and when this slave trader I tried to come and buy him the slave owners say he's not for sale says why not is he like like a supervisor or some you say no you say why does it work different then the slave owner said I found out later that he is a son of a king from where he comes from so although he was shipped to a whole different continent altogether whatever his external environments didn't change what was really within him he kept he still kept walking with his chest out because he know I'm a son of the King he knew who you really was where he was determined it'd not determine his identity so that's that's work that's the same situation we are in we are in a whole different environment altogether or all different world but our situations around us does not determine who we are we should walk with our chest out knowing that we are sons and daughters of God that we come from another Kingdom amen that's what we are portraying from where we come from and when we walk we know for sure that we are sons and daughters of the Almighty God and there is nothing that can stop us amen the prophet of God says then if he raised from the dead he is no more in a copper of body but he is in our body and all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the church so it's a continuation that day you'll know that I'm I'm in the father and the father in me and I am you all together the Holy Spirit working in the church amen we were made to be a mature God's hallelujah to create because that same power lies within us amen so there is nothing that can stop us so the moment the bride realizes who we are then we become an invincible army if we lay hands on the sick they will recover amen and we have the revelation that we come from God and we are going back to God that's why we shouldn't be too much concerned about cares of this world because we are not of this world we are citizens of the heavenly kingdom at different place altogether hallelujah you see that's why Daniel he wanted to live in this day God gave him the timeline of the God gave him the timeline of the life on Earth and he said Lord I want to live in that day God says no Daniel you go your way I have a special people that have to live in this day all the slots are already taken those people cause you see he had predestinated us before the foundation of the world amen you see in as much as you envy Daniels testimony of being in the Lions Den and not being eaten by lions he really wanted to be seated where you are because he saw the power that the church will be having amen so in as much as you envied him he envied you you said lord please put me in that dispensation that's where I want to leave God said no Daniel you go your way I have said this time for a particular special people who are supposed to run and be relays in this final race amen I believe most of you you have seen a relay race where you have four runners so usually when you have with the coach whoever is in charge of the team they usually put the fastest person at the at the beginning but then the fastest of them all he puts at the last as the fourth person so the first person is supposed to be fast enough to open the gap and give so that really the other two don't have to be really fast they just have to maintain then perhaps there was something that didn't go really well during the middle two exchanges that's why they put the fastest person because they'll be able if there was anything that happened wrong you'll be able to correct it to correct that that leg that happened and be faster and overtake and be first so that's what it is in the whole timeline God saw it fit that you and I be in this last day amen because he knew where the power that he invested in you and me we had the fastest people in this race a man with a full revealed word in our day we had the fastest people that's why Daniel was envying your spot he wanted to perform exploits like you are he wanted to heal cancer like it has been in our day because then cancer didn't exist and a disease that don't even exist in the three dimensions but that don't matter we have the power that God invested in us amen that's why you wanted to take a spot because he that we will be performing exploits amen so it is our duty and our mandate because we know we are the fastest people with everything opened old up with the whole Bible and all examples we can see ourselves in it we can do miracles amen we can do exploits hallelujah there is nothing that can stop us because in this relay race I tell you you are the fastest one amen because we know who we are we have realized our true identity in this last days amen and we have been given the power to speak we can speak and create you see back in the day Joshua one of the greatest miracles was Joshua when he stopped the Sun for a full 24 hours and there was a great miracle that was recorded in the Bible but in that's the last days it is a different situation all together we talk about creation of squirrels amen we talk about creation of healings amen because we had different type of people the most special people in this race the fastest one the last ones amen we know who we are can somebody say I Know Who I am Amen let us turn upon her feet amen because there is power in letting there is power amen there is power power wonder-working power in the blood of the Lamb there is power power wonder-working power in the precious blood sing there is power now power power wonder-working power in the blood of the Lamb there is power power wonder-working

there is power power wonder-working power in the blood of the Lamb there is power power wonder-working power in the precious blood of the late amen hallelujah we have power invested in us amen because we are sons and daughters of the mighty king amen we are kings and priests and we ought to exercise the authority that was given to us the same power they had on the day of Pentecost lies in you today amen the same creative power that God had you have the same thing this morning amen let us bow our heads for a word of Prayer do you have any father we thank you this morning oh Jesus Christ father
