rain we trust we'll get a little rain in here not the natural now but the spiritual amen amen not prolonging the time let's get right into the word of God we're going to ask that you turn with us to Psalm 91 1-9 remember our brother Keith he had eye surgery I think today the removal of cat pray that God would give him a speedy recovery remember our brother Rich he couldn't make it because of the weather doesn't see so well so when it's raining it's very difficult for him to travel I trust that uh both of them are listening to the word tonight Psalm 91 beginning at the first verse he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snares of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that fth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh de Only With Thine Eyes shall thou be behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation one more scripture coming from Revelations the 20th chapter Revelations 20 beginning at the first verse and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season and I saw throne and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus for the word of God and which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received the mark upon their forehead or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years let us pray dear heavenly father God we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace we pray father God that you will have your way this evening Lord we pray that you would sanctify us holy sanctify our body Soul and Spirit that we may be able to deliver your word according to your thoughts and your purpose in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I I started this message uh in Iowa City Iowa City we entitled the message the Eternal weapon G and I described what a Weaponry is a weapon is all the weapons that are that a group or country has or that are available to it for example America is feared by many countries because of their Weaponry we have rifles uh we have missiles we can drop a bomb from a plane from a ship and we the first when it comes to Atomic weapons and because we have all of this Weaponry the American citizens feel pretty safe now I want you to understand where I'm going with this because God is our weaponry and I want you to understand understand by the grace of God that God so plan this uh Sal he he so planned the world that nothing is out of order and everything is held in order by God's word you may not believe it tonight but God has you engaged you are engaged by his love God didn't just start loving you but the Bible tells us that he loved us even when we were in him hallelu right now we may not feel so loved but we are here the message brother Bram says in question and answers 1959 12th month 23rd day paragraph around paragraph 129 he said how could a man live above or live so close to God he would be without sin listen to this holy from the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love brother says his love did his love paid for my sins his love taken it away love is the most powerful force there is he said take a husband that really loves his wife he'll die for her freely and he say that's Brotherly Love Hallelujah now I want to say this by the grace of God often time we sing that song I want to be just like it hallelujah hallelujah amen I want to walk like him I want to talk like him I want to live like him but let me tell you about the man on the inside the man on the inside is eternal hallelujah hallelujah and the Bride of Jesus Christ is not to be be a copy hallelujah hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus Christ is the furtherance expression of him Hallelujah yall understand what I'm saying you had an Adam and in Adam there's a feminine part of Adam and when that Adam that feminine part was expressed it wasn't a second Adam it was Adam but it was a further expression of the man Hallelujah because in that day man consisted of male and female Hallelujah you understand me so we realize by the grace of God hallelujah this message come to do what Express a furtherance of Christ Hallelujah this is only the beginning hallelujah hallelujah in that same message paragraph 131 brother Brown said love CHS Us in love before the foundation of the world I want you to hear this now love chose chose chosen Us in love before the foundation of the world hallelujah hallelujah just like God can't live without us we can't live without God that's the Bride of Jesus Christ there is such an attraction we can't even help ourselves Hallelujah listen going on the brother prophet of God says having predestinated us he said now there's the word predestinated having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will it's not your will it's his will he chose you he chose me Hallelujah and we are enaged surrounded by his love the Bible call it a wall of fire amen amen so when Satan comes to destroy us he can't destroy us I just read the scripture amen when the enemy comes in like he's going to destroy us God is already put his boundaries there hallelujah hallelujah I don't know about you tonight but my refuge is in God and I am hiding under his wings somebody help me here you see I want you to understand hallelujah what this love of God is all about will always protect you somebody it's the truth when I was a sinner he protected me when you was a sinner he protected you even when you didn't know him but the secret of his love is that he knew you he knew me before the foundation of the world I don't have to worry about salvation salvation has already been taken care of Hallelujah but what God is wanting us to do is believe it have faith in God he goes on to say what about that brother Mike isn't that wonderful he loved you he loveed you before there was a world this is the part I life love brother he knowed your nature he knowed your weaknesses he knowed your habits he knowed all about you what you was going to [Applause] be my God have mercy Hallelujah and and then when he looked all over the great universe he said I Choose You somebody help me here you mean to tell me he knew how Wicked I was going to be he knew my thoughts to fall off he knew my habits he knew every Club I would go into knew every time I would take a drink he knew every time I would dance in an immoral way he said I choose you help me Hallelujah I choose you I'm so glad he chose me and you ought to be glad he chose you and when he did that before there was ever a speck of light then you eternal with God before there were ever a speck of life then you Eternal with God when you receive the Holy Ghost then you become Eternal see that's what the devil don't want you to get he don't want you to get the Holy Ghost part he knows if you get the Holy Ghost part that makes you Eternal hallelujah hallelujah glory to God this what he said he

coming from the message demonology paragraph 15 parag he says now it's just like I think the gifts of the Spirit the gifts of the Spirit is not the Holy Ghost it's the attributes of the Holy Ghost Gifts of healing speaking all those other things that are attributes it's a fruit that the tree Bears the tree main thing is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is God God is love so I'm going cap this off I'm going close this so you understand love divine is what we must have and all your trials have been trying to drive you forward into it some battles but keep your focus Paul said I press toward the mark calling which is in Christ right and brother Bram said it like this only Divine love is going to make it with all that we've done here tonight let's keep our Focus let's keep the F pray

you understand me the scripture said more are the children of the bonds woman than of the free a't many of there not going to be many of us make sure you one of them Romans 4 16 17 says therefore it is of faith that it might be by Grace what are you saying you you got to believe it what are you saying it's not works it's faith and when you have faith God will then give you work but you'll never be saved by your works is that right let me say it like this brother won millions of souls to the Lord Millions if that was Works how you going to compare to that they stop us at the door yeah therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise be sure to all the can see that nobody going to come up short not to that only but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made the a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who Quicken the dead and call those things be not though they were what are you saying it may not I'm going to call it what it is hallelujah right now I'm in the sinful flesh Hallelujah the message said I am in one of these old days I'm going to take a step
