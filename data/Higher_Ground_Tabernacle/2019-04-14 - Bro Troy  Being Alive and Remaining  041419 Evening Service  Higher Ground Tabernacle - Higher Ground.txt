had power to say I banker [Music] and I think I'm poor Amen if you've tried them a man okay man we had some issues with the recording this morning I sure enjoyed that message but it didn't make it to the internet so I was just for you well I sure did enjoy that message so I enjoy receiving as much as we enjoy giving it amen and I'll take every little bit of it amen amen now it's a traveling message the Lord ever gives me a chance Amen let's just open our Bibles to first Thessalonians chapter 4 will read the 13th through the 18th verse speak a message called being alive and remaining this scripture has been on my heart for Oh probably a month or so now but I heard it preached on my brother Tim Pruitt probably 10 15 years ago and just the way he preached China it's always stuck with me you know and and I just it's been on my mind now I kind of refreshed my memory recently and and just like I just got to preach on that amen amen because we want to be alive and we want to be remaining when he comes amen amen so first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 and it says I would not have you to be ignorant brethren considering them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope Amen so there is a hope that we have to have Amen and we have to have it as a possession amen for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again that speak service here even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord Himself showed the sin from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first he repeats that phrase again he says then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so we shall ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words that's quite a promise hey man you know I let's just find a hit where as River amen Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for this this word Lord promised father that or many people have received your promises over the years healing and deliverance lore but there are so few that have had a promise of meeting you in the air and lord I sometimes we forget that we have this promise waiting for us but nevertheless here it is on the pages of the Bible and I hear it still stands that there will be someone upon this earth who is going to be alive and they're gonna remain and that you are gonna meet us in the air llores we just want to walk around the scripture here for a few moments and talk it over Lord we just pray that you would come upon the scene father as we believe you chose the message Lord may you also bring the interpretation of it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can be seated something about having a promise like that that's it's different it's different than a lot of other promises that we've has it's more than just crossing a river and having it part before you it's more than the sick being healed it's more than the lost being saved but there's just something about how I'm going to promise that we who are alive and remain have a promise that we can look forward to meeting the Lord in the air it just it does something to me when I think about it that there are going to be people on this earth that are not gonna they're not going to pass down through death but like Enoch they'll be standing here and as it's been preached before the named Enoch knee is dedicated and disciplined amen and so they're going to people that are dedicated and disciplined on the earth they're gonna be waiting for the Lord and because they've waited up on the Lord he will show up and meet them in the air amen that will in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we are going to be changed and we're gonna get to meet the Lord in the air there is going to be a meeting in the air and the sweet sweet by-and-by I'm going to meet you greet you over there there's going to be a meeting in the air it's a promise that is just so astounding that somehow these bodies of ours is going to lose hold of natural gravitation and we're going to get to meet the Lord in the air amen as many people have looked for this great rapture that's great taking away amen and they've gone down to their graves waiting but there is going to be a people who who are actually going to - to experience this great promise amen and the pot in the Bible has a little description here of what those people are going to be like they're going to they're going to have this promise come over them amen they're going to be alive and they're going to remain now when it talks about being alive there's a lot of people that are alive on this earth that's not really what is talking about amen because there's many people on this earth that are alive amen but it's not talking about the natural kind of life that they're living amen they're their fruits testify about the life that they're living but no they're gonna be those that are not living by the natural life as within them but they're gonna be living according to the supernatural life of the Lord Jesus Christ that the life of Christ will be on the inside of them and they'll be living out as we said this morning they're giving free reign to the Holy Ghost amen they're gonna be free reign so that when they're so when the Holy Ghost is going on this trajectory and the and the cares of this life are going on this trajectory that this gives you to that amen and they yield their thoughts their ideas to the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can move in their life unimpeded those people are alive with the fruits of the Holy Spirit amen amen so not only will this people that are going to experience this promise be alive like that with the life of the Lord Jesus Christ on display they're going to be remaining amen no that means that they're that they've gone through something amen they've gone through something that could have taken them out of the way but yet they stuck through it anyhow amen there there are many things that try to grab ahold of them that could have put them down on the ground but yet even though even through all that they remained they stood there and having done all they stand amen they stand there's many things that came in like a flood but through it all through the Word of God and with the testimony of Lord Jesus Christ they're remaining a man when Jesus and we probably get that answer where Jesus said when I return will I find faith on the earth there will be a people that can raise their hand and say yes yes Lord yes when you return you will find you will find faith on the earth why because that faith is in me amen faith that you gave out on the day of Pentecost is still here is still remaining it's down inside my soul amen and it will not go and it will not go away amen we are alive and we're remaining and we're trusting in the Lord we have a faith inside of ourselves that will not die a faith that is in ourselves that just will not die that no matter what happens in this life's journey we just believe we believe in a power of the Lord Jesus Christ that is greater than any power in this earth or under this earth or above this earth it is greater than all other power and and we have submit ourselves unto this Lord Jesus Christ we've heard about him in the word we prayed unto Him and then we got to experience him in a baptism of the Holy Ghost amen therefore we know we have the evidence inside of ourselves that he is still alive and he still remains God therefore we are still alive and we still remain the bride of Lord Jesus Christ amen as much as it's been prophesied that someone is going to be alive and remain that means there is a promise that we can grab ahold of - we can make it through amen we can make it we can go through this we can go through all the way to the end why because there's me somebody that's gonna be alive and it's gonna remain and that somebody is gonna be us amen it's got to be us amen so and why is it us why because we know more than others no is it because we're smarter there's no we're no smarter than bails we don't know any more than anybody else does but we have something that's been revealed to us and it's the word of Lord Jesus Christ and by holding on to his word we're gonna be alive and remain there's something about the word of the Lord that once you latch on to it and you grab ahold of it that no matter how what happens in the doldrums of life or whatever comes along the long life journey there's something about that word that you just hold on to it no matter how you how you feel in your mind no matter what your spirit goes through no matter how whatever might happen in your spirit or in your mind there's something about that word that once you've latched on to it you just can't let it go why is that it's because there's a prophecy out there that you have to fulfill that you're going to be alive and remain among after everything after everything happens that could happen to a person on this life's journey you're gonna be the one that's gonna be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord and therefore because of that you get to meet him in the air amen because there is going to be a meeting in the air amen someone's gonna experience that meeting it might as well be me and it might as well be you because who else is it gonna happen to amen but to those that the promise was given amen when a people receive a promise of the Lord they latch on to it and they love it they love everything about it and so they're there for when it comes to manifesting time God sees to it that they're there it's just like Ana I don't know how old she was and Simeon I don't know how old he was but there's something about it that even while everybody else does born the same year they're born kept dying and passing away they had a promise that they would get to see the Lord amen and in God no matter how old they got they said the Lord has told us that we're going to see the Lord's Messiah amen and therefore when the Lord's Messiah came the Messiah found them still alive and still remaining and not only that but still trusting in the word that was given to him amen and even so let it be unto us according to thy word amen we are gonna go on believing in remaining why because that's just who we are that's just what we do amen you know if I if I was to go find a if I want to find a dentist I'd go to a dentist office if I went in there I'd see a man he's working on teeth and he's doing a good job and patching things up I could say that man is a dentist why the evidence of what he's doing and where he is proves that he is a dentist you know if you want to find a mechanic go down to the car dealership you go down into the shop before a guy with some grease on his hands he look and watch and he has some skill about him and he's sitting there fixing the car and when he's done the car is back in a better condition and he found it and it works just right he say that man is a mechanic well there's also going to be believers upon this earth a man if you want to find them you come to a body of believers and you look at them and then what they do they believe a man and that is what they do it's their occupation there's some people are plumbers some people are mechanics but there is a body of people on this earth that are believers Amen Jesus himself say when the Son of Man returns will he find faith on the earth and we'd like to be those that raise our hands and answer him and say yes Lord when you return you will find faith on this earth because you'll find me on this earth and your faith has entered down into my heart so much it's anchored there that no matter what happens to me upon my life's journey no matter what happens to me my body or in my spirit or in my mind or whatever it goes I am gonna be the one that believes in the Lord amen then you are the material that is gonna be found waiting and live and remaining at the coming of the Lord amen I'm kind of glad about that amen let's turn over to let's turn over to Matthew chapter 17 verse 24 I love this scripture here I love almond this little story means a lot to me just because it just it's just a little something that Jesus didn't have to do it this way but he did it just to help Peter out amen he did it just just to do something to help Peter out and what Jesus did here Peter could take and grab a hold of and hold it all the rest of the days of his life amen so Matthew chapter 17 verse 24 says and when they were come to Capernaum they that received tribute money came to Peter and said does not your master pay tribute he says yes and when he has come into the house Jesus prevented him saying what thinkest thou Simon you know I just almost have to wonder if maybe there was just something nagging on the back of Peters mind and he didn't fully understand something you know and and Jesus is gonna make sure he didn't want Peter to ever be waffling on anything so they wanted to make sure that the thing was settled in Peters mind amen and so he says what thinkest thou assignment of whom do the kings of the earth take customer tribute of their own children or of strangers and Peter saith unto Him of strangers and Jesus said to him then are the children free notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when now has opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money and take and give unto them for me and me so here Jesus is saying you know by rights we don't even have to pay this tax by rights we shouldn't have to pay this but even though we don't have us I had the money to pay it I maybe we shouldn't have to pay it so we don't offend them I have a way that we can pay it amen he says and go down no I don't know when when Jesus Jesus couldn't just snap to speak and could have handed a coin to Peter amen but instead he told Peter to go on down to go do something like this something he normally would have done a lot of experience fishing a man and maybe he's opened a lot of fish's mouth he's never never seen a coin in one before of you know tens of thousands of fish that he caught in his life amen but now something new is gonna happen he goes down there and it's not just he found a fish with the coin in his mouth but it's the exact fish that the Lord Jesus told him about to me the moment this happened to Peter just increased his relationship to the Lord a little bit tighter amen a little bit closer that faith was anchored a little bit more sure because when you realize what God is capable of not just that he reins up on high but the fact that he is able to reach down into the affairs of men a man he's able to reach down into your life amen and do anything that he wants to do and to change any situation to be exactly how he wants to change it so Peter he goes out and he gopas up the fish's mouth and sure enough there's that coin you know to me from that moment on how could Peter ever doubt again the rest of his days anything to do with finances amen from this moment on Peter could never worry about money again in my book he would have no right to because he knows at any moment in time that if he ever had need of something that the same Lord Jesus who is still alive could just direct him to go pick up another fish amen no we are the people that are alive and remain like Peter was say meant and so we also had the same ability to pull the same to his story about history amen whatever we have need of in this life's journey we know that the Lord Jesus is able to take care of it amen we have the same faith that Peters why do we have that faith because God gave it to us it's just as simple God gave us a faith that there are many others on this world that try to have that faith they they wanted to have that faith I've seen people up on stages praying hoping that they had that faith I've seen people yelling at demons to come out just hoping and that maybe that demon would come out I've seen people wishing to their prayers to be answered but there's something about the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that she's not wishing and hoping she knows her Lord amen she knows her Savior and she just believes him that's just that simple she just knows it's like it's like if I'm sitting in my living room at home and-and-and and the lights are on and they're a little bright and I'd like the lights to be turned off but I don't necessarily want to get up on the couch off the couch I can look over at my wife as she's walking by and say honey you know could you shut the lights off for me and you know what there's no there's no doubt in my mind but that she would just walk right over there and shut the lights off she wouldn't think about it she wouldn't pause about it she wouldn't say with exasperation she'd just go over there and flip the switch off now how much work did the Lord Jesus put in to get in that coin and that fish's mouth no more than what my wife would do to go turn on a light switch and this is our husband the Lord Jesus Christ amen when you realized that there is nothing impossible to God he doesn't have to work at it he doesn't have to try at it he just has to speak his word and it comes into a action it comes into beat and when you begin to have faith like that and you have a confidence in your relationship with the Lord and you just know the eight we are one of a kind amen flesh was blown flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen it's our husband we are the bride of Lord Jesus Christ we didn't make ourselves too bright it's just who we are we when we received them when we received that revelation we went and we grabbed ahold of every single promise that we could find in the Bible and we believed on until it came to pass that's how we receive the baptism of the Holy amen we believe the word and they came to pass in our lives and we received Christ on the inside the same Lord Jesus still alive still remaining in us and therefore we also get to be alive in Romania when he comes amen so that story vism just for Peters for all of us amen every single one of us if you have a need upon life's journey amen hey so I brought that quote up with me brother brands this one to read that real quick says well it just disappeared on me so we'll just continue on without amen amen let's turn over to ice turn over to Genesis chapter 22 real quick there are people throughout all the scripture that they got to a point in their lives to where they had seen God do so much but they just believed in God for everything amen that's quite a place to be amen they've just got to a place in their lives where they just seen God do enough that they knew Liew is just capable of doing anything that's a good place to be once you get to that place let me tell you Saints I hate to say you've arrived but you're you're pretty much there I mean you when you begin to realize that God has your back that when God is actually interested in affairs of your life that God really does love you he really does care for you he really does have his eye upon you and you just believe you just know it's not a hope so you don't have to wish it so you don't have to hope he hears your prayer you just know that he hears your prayer it's just a faith that rises up within you and that you actually have ownership of that faith Amen as maybe walk there they'll reach and grab out and grasp try grasp at that faith but there's other people that they just own it they just own that faith it's there so it's a possession thank you they received it from Christ himself as down anchored inside their soul and they just believe that they're believers that's just what they are as much as a mechanic as a mechanic a plumber as a plumber these are believers and they do believe amen amen Genesis 22 chapter 22 verse 5 and Abraham said unto the young man abide ye here with the ass and I and the Lord will go yonder and worship and come again unto you what's he doing there he's believing amen he's just believing and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and took the knife in his hand and the fire in his hand and the knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said My father he said here am I my son and he said Behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and so they went both of them together there's something that was within his soul that he just knew that God would provide and now we have Jehovah Jireh ever since then Amen everybody that's ever trusted in Jehovah Jireh was looking back to this scripture amen they our God will provide well our God will provide a lamb amen my gut my son God will provide himself a lamb for the burnt offering so they went both together amen and what happened the same here he goes up to kill his son and the same son he say will return again with us came back down why because God provided a lamb stay bruh ham knew he wasn't guessing you know sometimes and you know if they were trying to make a movie of it if Hollywood was to get ahold of this they'd have him doubting and everything else you know hey can you imagine what Holly would do if they tried to recreate this movie they'd have him doubting and everything else but you know he wasn't going up there and oh he wasn't Abraham knew exactly what was gonna happen we went out there we say are you sure about that brother Troy yes Abraham knew exactly what was what why why was Abraham able to say God will provide for himself a sacrifice he knew that God was gonna provide he knew that there was promises regarding that son Isaac and he knew that those promises could not fail and that no matter what happened to Isaac he didn't know exactly maybe how it was gonna go down exactly what was going to happen but he knew one thing that God's promises from way back we're going to come to pass and he even saw it as the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we know that those promises from way back are gonna happen you say why do you believe you know why do you believe the promise the promises of Lord Jesus Christ why do you believe in a rapture every generation has died and God the sand here you're thinking that you're gonna get out of here without dying why do you believe that because of a promise because of a promise who is that promise given to was given to me amen so I could be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord amen why did God give that promises and he gave it for me that's just what it is I'm taking that and applying to myself well how can you do that how can you do that how do you know it's not the generation after you he just gave it to me he just gave it to me it's mine I claim it I claimed in his mind as a possession amen amen amen now I'm gonna read that quote amen it says well the round says that little tree is set out a little slip of it set out and you have to water it and it has to drink it has to drink more than its portion and just drinks and the more drinks and drinks till it pushes out limbs and then it pushes out leaves and it pushes out buds then it pushes out apples it just keeps drinking and pushing and that's the way we are we are planted in Christ Jesus the inexhaustible fountain of life in exhaustible fountain of life that means we can just sit there and drink and drink and drink and drink amen we can read this Bible and accept it and accept it and believe it and believe it and it will just keep producing fruit in our lives that's just the way it's going to be amen amen we just drink and push and drink and everything that we have need when we're filled with the Holy Spirit every healing everything that we have need of in life's journey is given unto us right then right then when you're a young baby and Jesus Christ when you're a young just a young Christian when you were first received the Holy Ghost right then and there everything you have need of and this life's journey is given to you right then even the rapture Amen it's given to you it's yours everything I meet up is given to you right there Amen it's your personal property you own it amen and it's just the way it is other people they might worry about it they grasp it faith is always something external to some and something that they they wish this would happen but there's other people to have such a confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ that they know all the guy to do is bow their heads and start praying and all heaven starts listening and there's not a doubt in them about where their prayer goes because they know exactly where their prayer is going and they know exactly who is listening to it and they know exactly what his capabilities are that's just the bride and Lord Jesus Christ amen and that's the condition that we are to be when the rapture we're supposed to be alive and remaining with the same faith until the coming of the Lord amen so when the so when the rapture does come amen just five minutes for the rapture what condition are we gonna be in we're gonna be alive with life of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're gonna remaining still believing after everything that we've gone to still trusting and knowing that the promises of God are true but the promises of God are yes and amen amen amen everything that we have need of and life's journey is given to us right then it's all your personal property just drink that's all look and live that's all then you can easily see the resurrection can't you what's the resurrection he talking about he's talking about changing back to a young man that's the resurrection he's talking with he's talking about changing back to a young man again how say how do I do that I just keep drinking and keep pushing and that life that is welling up on the inside of me all son begins to manifest itself and the gray hair turns what amen the the wrinkles turn smooth amen gain weight over the years it goes back amen everything is just goes right back to where it was why because that is what God had in his mind in the beginning a man God had his mind in the beginning all those attributes right there and so we drink and we push we keep pushing out those fruits but there is another manifestation to where it comes and finally changes this mortal body and one day in a moment in a twinkling of an eye after all that drinking and all that pushing we're gonna be changed why because we are those that are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord and when the Lord comes he comes for he comes the window son of man returns where will he lay his head amen upon the bride of Lord Jesus Christ he is the capstone they are the pyramid amen that's just the way it's going to be man accepting the word keeps me alive just constantly accepting the word keeps me alive every time I accept it every time I find something I accept it I say yes Lord ask truth Lord Amen Lord I received that in my life Lord and that's what keeps me alive amen it's just like if you had an engine if you drain it with all of its oil although I loved it it wasn't even starts getting hot it starts overheating and things start burning up on the inside but if you take an engine and you just keep it oil and they're fresh I can just run mile after mile ten thousand miles later fifty thousand miles later two hundred thousand miles later three hundred thousand miles later that engine just keeps being refreshed to every oil change refreshed and refreshed and refreshed and it just keeps running in the same condition and then after three hundred thousand miles it still has pretty much the same amount of metal it had the beginning why because there's always that smoothness of the oil within it amen same thing with the Christian they keep drinking they keep pushing they don't get frustrated they don't get worried why because they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ it's when you start doubting that you start overheating why is that because you're losing the oil of the Holy Spirit and when you get mad and frustrated you start overheating why because you're losing the oil of the Holy Spirit amen you have to get back to that refreshing Amen at a time of renewal why so that that anger doesn't come back and you only by staying in his presence do you keep staying in that same condition and that condition is being alive and remaining being alive and remaining through it all you were alive and you remained in the same condition so it's the same condition you were back at the dealership 300,000 miles later you're in the same condition why because you have had there you've had the experience of the refreshing of the Holy Ghost over and over and over and oil change after oil change refilling after refilling refilling after refilling why because you're gonna be one of those that are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord amen how did you make it through brother I just trusted in the Lord I just trust in the Lord constantly faithfully every problem that's the medicine I took for every problem I'm just trusting in the Lord just believing in his word amen I know he'll see me through I took the problem I laid it upon the altar where the blood of the Lamb is amen I've checked my life over I've done everything I know how to do so now I'm just waiting upon the Lord hey man let's turn over to first Kings 17 there's a familiar story but we'll read through it again we won't be much longer I'm sorry second Kings three second Kings three verse 16 Sartre the 14th verse and Elijah said as the Lord of Hosts liveth before whom I stand surely were not by regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I would not look toward the Norse easy but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass so in the minstrel played that the hand of the Lord came upon him amen this is a familiar story we remember the evil king and asked Elijah to come and give him a blessing tell him how to win the battle but that the evil King didn't deserve to win a battle at that time but because there was a righteous King there on the battlefield Jehoshaphat amen Elijah came and said I will just because of why Josh defense presents a man so so he had a minstrel calm play and the presence of Lauren came down and the answer the Lord said thus saith Lord make this valley full of ditches for thus saith Lord ye shall meet you should not see win neither show you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye in your cattle in your beasts and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand amen so there they were there stuck out in the desert there trying to win a battle and they couldn't win it and then they started running our water and now even the Eagle Creek King is crying out to Jehovah for help amen and that's how it is when times get rough he's just reading the other day an article about they say down Venezuela Venezuela has been a godless country for a long time amen but now all of a sudden they're having a resurgence of faith amen the churches are being filled why because they're running out of food they're running out of clean water they don't know when their electricity is going to come back on there our government is in shambles he used to be the richest country in South America and now they're the poorest country in South America and what's going on now all of a sudden because they're in trouble they're returning back to the Lord and right now if all the powers to come back on and food in every home where were the churches be next Sunday you know that's just the nature of people a man by the but Elijah said okay so you need water and you need the Moabites to be killed and so he told me start digging ditches the waters gonna come you gotta get ready for it you know and and even though the the king is there they did exactly what the Prophet said the Bride of Christ knows that whatever the word of Lord says she just gets ready and it happens amen it did not surprise Elisha amen it may have surprised everybody else in that entire scenario but Elisha was one man that was not surprised that what happened that all of a sudden you know next morning a rush you know water came through and filled all our ditches with water and then what the Lord came is through their enemy so as I saw with the Bride of Christ she's not surprised at what the Lord does the Bride of Christ is not surprised when God answers her prayer why because she believes she when she prays she is expecting that God will hear her prayer why does she do that because she's alive and she's remaining what's your main and perfect faith she's remaining in the same condition that she was back at the beginning amen back when God first thought of her back when however the condition that's that God imagined his bride to be in that same condition that he prophesied them to being we've accepted that prophecy is ours it's a possession it belonged to us when we received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're still holding on to it amen and so now no matter what happens to us upon this life's journey we just keep drinking and pushing amen and we know they are God will answer our prayers and it doesn't surprise us when it happens Amen what we knew God would do that we knew that God is capable of doing that it doesn't it doesn't surprise us from God answers prayers amen amen let's just last scripture here Psalms 23 brother Isaiah was gonna minister tonight but yeah got held up in Iowa City there and had to stay over so he asked me to minister this evening for them amen Psalms 23 verse 4 it says yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now prepare us a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all of the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever hey man can we receive that amen you received that a man is that your scripture does that belong to you do you have ownership of that scripture will you have ownership of that scripture tomorrow what about the next day amen next week next month amen are you ever going to give up on that scripture amen it's ours it belongs to us all the days of our lives amen even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death oh sure no evil what because he's with me amen amen he anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over and goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life every day from this state of the rapture I are regarded on my calendar this is the day that goodness and mercy are gonna follow me and then the next day of my calendar says the same thing I'm surely goodness and mercy is gonna follow me this day also he just miles will write down on every day of the calendar because it's just gonna be it's just gonna happen and it doesn't surprise us because that is the way that it is for the bride of Lord Jesus Christ as Paul said in sickness and death and suffering and in calm and no matter what it is wherever I am you know wherever whatever happens I know and whom I believed it amen and I am a possessor of all things no matter where I'm at a second Corinthians 4:16 I believe a man let's just stand we are to be those that are alive and remain amen amen God is able isn't he let's just Bauer has a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we are the people who have seen you do so much Lord that we've seen you do so much in our lives Lord that we just believe Lord we've we're just we just don't have the capability to disbelieve anymore father for this belief has left our souls all that remains there is belief and faith Lord and when you return you will find a people believing on this earth because we'll be here amen and you said you prophesied that there would be a people in the last days that would be alive and remaining at the coming of the Lord and Lord and that we've here to claim that promise father it's ours you gave it to us when you gave us the Holy Ghost and we want to thank you for it Lord so here we are Lord we're here to receive our portion of life this day so that we can remain Lord and tomorrow we're gonna receive our portion of life for tomorrow and every day from this date of the rapture Lord we are gonna stand up and say you should we asked Lord to anoint our head with oil so that my cup can run over so that mercy and goodness will follow me this day just like all other days because of your promise father always want to thank you for giving us the ability to be the believers in this last day to be those that we don't have to wander we don't have to doubt we don't have to cry out for this or cry out for
