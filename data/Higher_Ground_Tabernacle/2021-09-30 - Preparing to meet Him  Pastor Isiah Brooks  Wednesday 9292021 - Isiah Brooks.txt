mercy reroll my life amen how many of us feel like that tonight i am so grateful for his mercy we're gonna ask that you turn with us to second timothy four and eight we surely appreciate all of your prayers uh while we were out of town we we had a wonderful time uh god really blessed we thank god to also you know about a year ago around this time my mother-in-law not only passed but was buried on yesterday i believe it was and then the lord just so ordained everything that my wife and i were away and you know thank god for giving her the great time that she did have we had such a beautiful flight holly no turbulence or anything like that and god was gracious to us you know that's those things that you think he doesn't care about he cares and so i thank god for my wife taking that trip with me it made me a better man amen so we appreciate everybody who uh who's here uh this evening and we're going to ask that you turn with us to second timothy the fourth chapter we're going to read the eighth verse here's four there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not me only but unto all them also that love is appearing amen let us pray father god we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us we thank you lord for just allowing us to see this end time word and to understand by your grace and father we say that you give us the grace to speak only the things that you would have us to speak we don't have no other agenda other than to bring your word to the people we're not here to be great we're not here to be seen we're trusting that you will speak through this badge of skin and give us ears to hear and to receive amen we ask these things in your lovely name jesus christ have thine own way amen you may be seated i like to entitle this message preparing to meet him we're living in the last days and many of us know that amen one of the things that have really struck my heart and mind is that god always interpret his own word amen that's true and often times we as men those who consider themselves great in the word of god theologians whatever you might want to call them everybody has a tendency to interpret the word the way they see it but we know the bible said that god's word is not given unto into no private interpretation in other words you know one institution uh doesn't have the right to interpret the word and then the other institutions have no right no institution have a right to interpret the word actually god interprets his own word and for example you know nobody understood uh the preaching of noah and how noah said it was going to rain well the rain in itself was a a foreign word because in that day it had never rained before but at god's appointed time when god had set his clock for it to rain it rained in other words god proved the words that mo uh noah preached was correct and true and one thing about god is when the word of god is preached or when it's brought forth by way of a prophecy or just by the literal word god proves his word by manifesting it amen so we know by god's grace that if we are we are living in the last days like let's go on to say how god interpreted his word when it came to a virgin shall conceive well that was beyond the intellect that was beyond anything that a man a woman could imagine uh we understand by god's grace that they could have tried to figure it out but it would have been of no avail because they had never seen such an event as a virgin conceiving but mind you when even she did conceive the whole world didn't know nothing about it amen jesus not only was born and raised standing in the temple at 12 years old and they still did not know that he was the manifestation of isaiah prophecy that a virgin shall conceive nevertheless it happened and in in all of that we understand that because the people's eyes were blind and isaiah said it would be that they would have eyes to see and have no understanding and ears to hear and not be able to perceive and mind you uh at the coming of this of the lord this time the scriptures also spoke of a blindness uh leocell would not only be blind but she would be rich and increase with good and she would say within herself she have need of nothing so god whenever he's uh doing his word or whatever whenever he gets ready to do something he does it and then he causes the people to look back to see what he's already done only those people that are ordained for that day catches the revelation of what he's doing like for example when hannah and all and uh was in the temple uh praying anna the prophetess and here come mary on the eighth day to get jesus christ circumcised uh by way of prophecy and by way of her having eyes to see and to understanding she was ordained to see the messiah at his early coming now thank you think about it here he was in the form of a baby a toddler a baby excuse me eight days old coming to the temple to be circumcised and god reveals to her that this is the messiah i believe it was simeon as well that god revealed this is the messiah and so you and i understand that god uh always bear a witness there's always somebody he says he's never left himself without a witness now think about it even in the days of uh moses when god prophesied that he would bring his son out of egypt and and here was moses and egypt being raised by pharaoh's uh daughter and and all of these kind of things and here was the deliverer right in there on their territory and and god hid him uh for all of those years and they never did see until god was ready to manifest his word by way of moses see that's the way god always does it don't you know that even in the time that jesus christ was on earth many people didn't know i mean you could say like 99 of the world didn't even know the messiah was on the earth and that one percent that would have been in israel didn't know that he was there either right only a small portion of people knew jesus was on the earth and then out of that small portion of people you had believers and you had make believers and you didn't had those who just wouldn't believe it all that's right you know you think about that you we look at christianity and we think oh the whole world but you got to understand it was not so they didn't come to know that jesus christ was the messiah as the world would know him until after he was dead buried and and resurrected you see what i'm saying and and even so now we still have the same scenario but we realize by god's grace we are at a time when we are here to meet god amen amen and it's literally it's disturbing me because i realize that there are so many people who are not taking it seriously and we are living in the last day amen amen excuse me and because your church buddy doesn't see it doesn't mean that it's not happening i remember i talked with you the last time i think one of the last times and i showed you that after the resurrection jesus did not appear to everybody that right you think about it now after the resurrection he did not appear the the sadducees the herodians the pharisees the denomination didn't even know he was risen matter of fact there was a decree that uh a word that went out to say that his disciples stole his body so among the jewish people they didn't believe even after he died that he was the messiah but after he rose from the dead he appeared to mary is that right he appeared to peter he repaired he appeared to those on the road to emmaus and then he appeared to the whole 12 right i say 12 but you know judas was no longer there but but by the grace of god all of the women whoever else was there they were there they were in the upper room and they saw jesus now mind you think about the people who didn't believe that he he literally there's historians said he didn't die that it was a fake death and you know and then you have those who believe you know that uh they were these christians were accountable especially when jesus said eat my body and drink my blood and you know you know you had all of these different ideas and thoughts going on all of these thoughts and ideas were thoughts of unbelief so i want to say this tonight your unbelief can never stop god that's right amen doesn't matter who we are or what we can claim to be or what we think who we think we are the the word of god only works for those who truly believe amen amen hallelujah now we know that the lord is soon to come we know the world can't go but so far even if the political realm was not carrying on the way that they are you understand what i'm saying i'm trying to say it's chaos but if you look at the world and the prophecies and the things that god said was going to happen earthquakes and diverse places floods and pestilence and you know i i saw something on on on on the channel the youtube channel i always look at educational things and sometimes i think some of these things are more higher than my mind can conceive but nevertheless they were saying how that even they're finding out that they you know as these polar caps as it melt they're finding bacteria that cannot die it goes into some kind of stasis where it appears to be dead frozen but as soon as it unthaws it comes back to life and and they're multiplying bacteria we know nothing about viruses we know nothing about y'all understand what i'm saying so you got to understand that evidently the time of these disasters where flesh your flesh will be eaten even while you're alive and things of this nature it's coming it's moving into position and the prophet god said only those who have the holy ghost will be able to escape these plagues so you better understand is it important it is very very very i can't express it stress it enough for us to make sure we have the sealing of the holy ghost i mean in our soul not just on our flesh and in our spirit that's going to make us feel good but we need the holy ghost in our souls it doesn't mean the devil won't fight but the bible tells us that many are the afflictions of the righteous and god delivered them out of them all see we look at this little virus that we call and i don't want to take it like it's light because it's a lot of people have died from it and have died from other things with it but nevertheless it is a virus and and it does attack people and christians are not exempt right but we we must put on the whole arm of god our battle is of the lord and you and i must understand that when the enemy comes in like a flood the bible said god lifts up a standard and i believe we're that standard that god is lifting up but we must understand also if we're preparing to meet him that means to make something ready for the use right to prepare it you know preparing doesn't mean oh i hear the voice of god the rapture takes place and all of a sudden god goes switch the flip uh flip the switch right if you die unholy if you die unrighteous if you die filthy you get up that way amen y'all understand me however the tree falls that's the way it lay and this is the thing we find out that listen people they call you a cult and when they do call you that you know you're not the only one you're not the first because i'm gonna tell you something can you imagine jesus christ walking with 12 men and a few women and many of them have left their jobs how what do you think they called him same thing it doesn't change and the people's opinion about us doesn't change but one thing for certain what do you think they call noah in his group eight souls amen and all these people are talking about amen it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain and our scientists have not even discovered there be such a thing as rain you see what i'm saying so you got to understand you're living in a day of unbelief you're living in a day that people are going to call especially when you're a true christian they're going to think you are cultish because you don't do this and you don't do that you don't go places where you know christ will not go you don't act and you don't do things that you know jesus wouldn't do you understand me people can't understand your lifestyle because they feel i've had a friend of mine for years have you been delivered from that bondage and i mean she's got all this crazy makeup and whatever and i'm looking at her like are you serious who's in bondage at least i know who i am and i know what i am hallelujah i don't have to fix it up i know exactly who i am and so you look and you know i had a brother tell me that long time ago he was in a different sect of some kind and and i i i'm thinking oh you saying i was in bondage well when you see people not understanding the move of the holy ghost they think it's a cult right because they think that when you go to church it's supposed to be quiet the song's supposed to be you know whatever you know quite dead and whatever whatever but if it's different from their church it's a cult amen can you imagine the pressure that jesus and his disciples went through in their day but you see what good will it do you to gain this whole world and lose your soul y'all understand me you can have a mansion you can have a yacht you can have all of these great things of the world but when god calls your number you're leaving all that amen hallelujah i'm gonna tell you something you might be rich in this world but without jesus when you die you die poor hallelujah you don't even have clothes to put on your clothes don't go with you and that's why people spend all that money in those funerals and dress these people all up so as though they looking down at them and they said well you know i'm they they dress me well that's nonsense do you really think somebody in heaven is concerned about how you dress them in a coffin or put it this way anybody in hell do you really think they're concerned about how you dress them in a coffin it's vanity it's all vanity but you know we're subject to that we do that because of what people are going to think yes so i'm working with something here i'm trying to get something because i want you to understand the most important thing about you is your body hello understand this the bible says according to first corinthians the 6th chapter 19th and the 20th verse what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glory by god in your body and in your spirit which are gods now a lot of times us or people think amen that uh god god is just working with sanctification but no the bible is working with his body in his body you're supposed to do as his body would do if that makes sense however jesus is and that's what he says we are in this world as he is and we do the things that jesus do amen if jesus was living in this time and and i'm talking about you know this is going to be something i work with on the 10th when i get back but this is something i'm going to work with you see the bible says come together the more now some of us can't come because we're working and think god knows all of that and that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about people who stay home doing nothing watching something amen you understand me and god said come together listen where is the holy ghost amen because the holy ghost will not break his word that's right y'all understand me the holy ghost will not break his word the holy ghost that's what brother said he said when that church door is open that real christian can hardly wait to get there you know what how counter christians are if brother brooks is not here they don't come that's so that's nonsense amen nonsense what who am i god speaks to troy and everybody else amen it's not a man this is not a man thing it's a god thing and it's carnal christians that stay home you're not even preparing when i speak this i'm talking about a group i i just you know met with a group anyway issues that we were talking about and it's the same way down in iowa city as it is here yeah friday night so they have friday night service and holiday nobody show up now what are they doing the same thing they're doing here on wednesday nights we're preparing and the bible said when you see that day approaching if you don't see it approaching something's wrong hallelujah come together the more i don't care if you're tired with one eye open god will honor it amen no you not and this is what i'm i was thinking with i says lord he wants to use my eyes he wants to use my hands he want to use your feet he want to walk in you he want to talk in you he want to worship in you you see what i'm saying everything that god would want to do he chose you to do it through that's why you call bride you're his body hallelujah it's okay keep preparing to meet him you know what i'm trying to say is that like a lot of times people don't understand they think well if i don't eat this i'll eat no no no no you understand what i'm saying god will sanctify you and he will fill you with the holy ghost if you are obedient amen you can have it but i'm talking maturity i'm talking about growing into the statue of christ i'm talking about allowing god to beat you into position right your gold tried in the fire amen tried that means bow the fire tries you it pulls out all of the draws y'all know what i'm saying anybody know what i'm talking about when you're under pressure that's the real you hallelujah but that doesn't mean the real you is lost that means the real you needs improvement amen thank god for the pressure amen hallelujah amen amen oh you you yeah the pastor go through his times of pressure too don't you dare yeah so anyway y'all understand what i'm talking about preparing you prepare it's like when you're gonna eat dinner you can't make dinner if you don't go prepared for it you gotta go shopping for the ingredients and all of the things that you're going to prepare right and you know you don't you don't start cooking the beans before you start cooking the meat because you know the meat is going to take longer especially if it's something that you're roasting now if it's fried chicken or something like that that's a different story but i'm talking about something that's going to be uh have a time to work with so what i'm trying to say is this how can how are you preparing to meet god let's just use a natural scenario where in a woman who's preparing she's already pregnant but she's also preparing for the baby to come and she's stacking up little items and foods and she's very preparing the room and all of these kinds of things she's doing and the baby has no idea that you're doing all of this but you are aware that the baby is coming so you prepare yourself for that event and guess what it never comes when you think it will so is the rapture amen it never comes when you think it will so therefore you need to be prepared i can remember the first time when my wife had her baby had crystal and we were working with a lot of germans they loved us they loved my wife as well and especially my wife and anyway uh they had prepared a baby shower for her but the baby came before the before they could have the shower and guess what i made history they gave the shower to me so i was the first man with a baby shower and at that time i didn't have a car so i had all these bags of baby stuff i had to get on the bus with all that stuff you know but i'll never forget it made god bless them i was a witness i tried to witness them the knowledge of jesus christ the best that i knew how many of them were catholic and some of them did change because i met them years later and they were how happy about how they were they were christian and how i talked to them things of that nature you understand what i'm saying but nevertheless the preparation was set before the baby so when the baby come but the baby came before she could celebrate you understand what i'm saying so what i'm trying to say is that listen people you don't get ready at the last minute when you know you've got issues in your life the only thing you can do is says lord help me clean cleanse me lord i heard the prophet god say something like this the other day which which amazed me he said i'm going to use the scripture because that's what he was working with the mind trying to control bring the mind unto suggestion and the subjection he said you know you continue to say lord let this mind be in me let the mind of jesus christ be in me let the mind he said continue to say that amen amen amen amen that's right when you know you're falling short you go before god and he says lord continue continue to let the mind of jesus christ be in me he said you keep saying it till it manifests itself so we got to keep saying those things that we're desiring and that's what he said even about the holy ghost he said if you can picture the holy ghost if you can picture jesus he said you in your mind if you can picture jesus he said you picture jesus and you walk to water until you come to it amen see that's what we those little nuggets those little things are laying in there sometimes they just jump out at us but if you're going to prepare yourself you must put on the whole arm of god now you say well what is the whole hammer god the divine nature of god is the whole arm of god not piece of it not just your helmet you've got to put on listen you're going to have to put on the whole armor for the trials they're getting ready to come now we're blind if we think that the stock market is not going to crash now we don't know exactly when but the way is teetering and shifting it looks like it's going to happen pretty soon if it doesn't when it does are you prepared oh you said what do you mean remember that remember that old widow woman in elijah's day when i said like this when the stock market crashed and famine was in the land and all she had was a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil that's all she had but one thing she had was faith in god she knew that the god she served amen was going to take care of everything she may not have known how he was going to do it but she knew he would when you have that kind of faith you activate god amen is that right we don't even know where elijah was but the bible said he was by that brook and god caused that brook to dry up and when the brook dried up he went looking god directed him to this little woman and god works on both ends god had already showed somebody's coming by y'all y'all know what i'm saying my old mama my mama gone she's gone but she's all junior i feel good to laugh in the blessing somehow i don't know how and what he's going to do but a blessing is coming listen it would always be that amen you ever wake up sometimes you're feeling good like something's good is about to happen and it happens somehow god gives you that little premonition of something of good that's going and then you got those things that feel bad too right how many of y'all feel sometimes when a person gets on your heart and you feel so burdened you know why that is you're supposed to pray for them that's intercessory they're in a place they cannot pray so god needs you to pray for them is that the body amen absolutely absolutely listen romans 12 1-2 says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your body a living sacrifice y'all know what that is that's mean even when you don't feel like doing it amen sacrifice you got to go out of your way that's right amen a living sacrifice what holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to the world this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god now that scripture to me is eternal it is the word of god but to prove what is good and acceptable in this day is not the same thing that noah had to do it's not the same thing that uh moses had to do because they had to noah had to build an ark more moses had to say put the blood on the doorpost in a little y'all understand me he did what was good and acceptable in the sight of god at every age every dispensation every church age things changes as i said last week what they did amen in ephesus is not the same thing we must do now ephesus had all the gifts emphasis had perfect love people amen they they had faith right let's put it this way did they have perfect faith is that right right but love work faith worketh by love so they had to have perfect love to have perfect faith amen amen you understand me and if you look yourself why couldn't they take the rapture because of you you and me because of us we had not come into place yet but one thing for certain we know that god interprets his own word hallelujah and therefore god by you coming into this message hearing the word of god for this age you are candidates for perfection and he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it it's not you it's him in you christ in you the hope of glory amen that's why i shout because i realize i'm not the maker i'm just the guy that he's making hallelujah i like to read this from the amplified version it really was a blessing to me romans 12 1-2 i appeal to you therefore brethren and beg of you in view of all the mercies of god to make a decisive dedication of your bodies presenting all your members and faculties as a living sacrifice holy devoted consecrated and well pleasing to god which is your reasonable rational intelligence intelligent service and spiritual worship and you say well you are all service so i'm saying when the church need help where are the helpers and don't tell me helpers are not here because god said he put helpers in the church hallelujah but you've got so many people a man who think that their bodies is theirs if you're a christian you've been bought with a prize your body is not yours it's god's and god can do whatever he will let me say it like this if god has placed gifts in you and you fail to use those gifts you are in trouble remember the man who failed to use the gifts of god the judgment of god was not nice you understand me we are workers together we are lively stones fitted together for his purpose and we're supposed to use everything we have i mean i wish the whole church would be here i wish those if there'd be some on the youtube listening i would i want you to hear this because it's not in your body it's god you don't have you're not supposed to have a will your will if it be the will must be the will of god oh i don't you know what i'm trying to say is sometimes people say well brother brooks ain't here uh on on sundays enough where are you here on wednesdays i'm here almost every wednesday far more wednesdays than sundays and for those of us who don't come well don't come to church on wednesday i'm telling the world on you don't come to church on wednesday and then on sundays if i'm not here you're not here who is your god and i'm going to tell you something if i'm your god you're in trouble you're in trouble because i fall to every day amen my perfection comes from jesus christ alone y'all understand me but people think that they can just do what they want to do don't you understand even when it comes to me god is recording everything can you imagine how humiliated people will be when they know they're supposed to be in church and they're looking looking at something on tv or doing whatever i don't even know what people do nowadays i really don't know am i making sense yeah i'm telling on you do not do not be confirmed to this world this age right we don't work with the fashions we're not about the fashions we you know we dress as nice as we can we want to present ourselves in a nice way we come before the king y'all understand this when you come before the king just think if the king is here think about it you know there shouldn't be like a church doctrine that you gotta dress so and so and so and so but i think sometimes people forget who they're coming before that's the truth we must understand it ain't supposed to be all of that but god don't care about what i look like oh yes he does he even cares about all the colors you wear you say god don't care don't you know he said not even one hair on your head should perish whether you see all mine or not i still got them right so you got to understand god cares about everything about you you his design you're his image he cares about you and he wants to see us prosper he wants to see us do good he says he will that we prosper even as our soul prosper so god is not trying to keep any natural substance from you if he said seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added if you do that in faith everything will be added yes your desire is that right he said if you if you if you abide in me and my word abide in you you can ask whatsoever you will i like that word whatsoever whatsoever you will and it shall be given unto you all you got to do is stay in the word and let the word stay in you and god will give you whatever you desire is that the truth it's in the scripture esther i love esther so y'all gonna hear me talk about her i can't hardly wait till i get her see her you know oh i want to see her you know me because we think it was a light thing no sir esther had all the pressures of the world on her can you imagine this woman you know like i said the world on her shoulders not only was she caring about her her life her life but she had the whole of israel the burden of israel saving them on her shoulder yes so anyway let's move on if i say uh it goes on to say and and and and be not conformed to this world this age fashion after and a doc adapted to it's a external uh uh uh excuse me superficial customs but he transformed or changed by the entire or renewal of your mind and this is what people say you want to be changed this is your renewal this is your soul the word of god will wash your mind amen you can't expect amen to be cleansed in your spirit if you don't read the bible or listen to the message hallelujah i'm going to tell you something you need a you you got you got a real request and i tell you what if you listen to enough tapes all you got to do is ask god to show you boom and god will direct you right to that anybody know what i'm talking about i'm a witness answer's right there on the tape there are times there's one tape i was even called my name isaiah i'm like wow because that was what i was going through but somebody else's name was isaac you understand me it was the idea of the bible but when he said it it it just it was me i can't explain it y'all think i'm crazy but anyway so you got what we're doing and i'll try my best you know i don't have that watch back but the thing is we must learn that this is the hour to prepare ourselves is that the scripture the bible says matthew 25 there were ten versions and the voice at midnight cry go what do i go meet the lord prepare to meet the lord you've got to prepare do you think you're going to meet him any kind of way even esther knew not to just go in in any kind of clothes you've got to go in in the robe that he furnished what is the road that god furnished for you other than the holy ghost that's the that's the that's what opens the door of heaven for you the holy ghost that's the key is that right because when he went into heaven y'all remember i love that story i wish i was a good actor but i can't do it but when when when the angels said oh lift up your head all your gates and and you everlasting doors and let the kingdom glory come in and then the angels cried out who was that king of glory and that whole said the lord almighty strong in that amen he is the king of glory when he said that those gays swung open y'all understand me he is the key without jesus christ the door won't open that's right why because he is the door amen hallelujah he is the door amen oh glory to god right it is that time and people don't well i'll tell you what there's a lot of visions people say they went to hell and came back well i don't believe that right because when the rich man went down there god wouldn't let him back and uh i just said it's possible they had a dream and maybe god warned him in the dream but i don't think they truly went there uh-uh that's how so many people say oh well i went to heaven and i saw little children right then you know it's a lie there are no children in heaven when you die you don't go to go to uh even if you're a baby when you go to you go in the perfect image that god made you and babies came by way of the sin that's right amen everybody was supposed to be created as brothers and sisters full adults ain't gonna be no babies can you imagine you've been in heaven and have to feed a baby change your baby it won't be heaven for you y'all understand me it's not going to be that and but people believe that kind of stuff hallelujah you love the lord you think about it how the pill of fire is so powerful who is jesus christ himself amen right god always proves his word and he pushes us to the limit to see if we true believers absolutely amen he didn't he didn't say okay you know we're going to throw them into the lion's den daniel to the lion's den and you know i'm going to let daniel know that i'll be in there he did not but when daniel walked in there he found out that the god that he's always worshipped was standing there too he was the one not daniel he was the one that made those lions keep their mouth shut god was in the fire like i said when when he told noah come on in the ark that means that he was in the yard if he wasn't in the yacht and said go into the yacht he didn't say it he said come on into your heart y'all understand me that's why when the fire comes he'll say come on in the fire hallelujah because he is the fire he in the fire hallelujah you love the lord so what we're doing with all of our hearts and our minds and i don't know about you i have to confess and ask for forgiveness every day somewhere i find myself coming short amen but listen i know who to turn to you understand me i have a savior who's able to save me to the uttermost not the almost the uttermost and the only way we'll climb this ladder we must learn how to deny ourselves not my will lord but time be done can you imagine what what what what what paul went through paul was considered dead i believe three times how many of us would have said well lord that's enough now i mean these people don't kill me three times you resurrect me three times y'all understand that can you imagine he didn't go to heaven he was resurrected three times to know that he had to die again so you can't imagine what what paul felt and what he felt like when he realized this is the final i'm going to nero's dropping block and the same god that raised me up will be the same god waiting for me there hallelujah but paul was not afraid of death he said oh death where's your stain oh grave where is your victory thanks be to god who's given me the victory to our lord jesus christ amen paul wasn't afraid he said i've fought a good fight i have kept the faith and there remains for me a crown of righteousness not just for me but all who believe in the same way i believe and i believe it amen i believe it amen dress dress see brother said like this he said by true believers he said he proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it's by his his believing children that he proves his word you got to be a believer this word is not for a non-believer right and the see there is no excuses we understand the raptures at hand the seven church age is basically over i say it is because in 1957 56 amen they the the they were try indictment was given to them by god they were tried in the fire hallelujah and in 1963 you got to understand the messenger was put out of the church he told us that he said i've gone come down to phoenix in tucson and none of these people would allow me to even come preach in their church it wasn't him i'm not talking about the man i'm talking about the world in which he was carrying hallelujah and right now they don't understand what took place with the cloud they now people just disputing it and said it wasn't real would go head-on they didn't believe christ in his first resurrection they're not going to believe the second one either you know why because it's not going to come the way they think it's going to come we're going to see him there will be a corporal body yes we will see him hallelujah i don't know how he's going to do it all but i know he's going to do it however he interprets it is fine with me but i know something took place that would that that put that gave the bride rapturing faith see what i'm trying to say is when you know this is the season it will give you rapturing faith hey yes sir it'll give you rapturing faith when you know that the bus is coming at seven o'clock hallelujah you gonna be there you might even be there waiting on the bus but you're going to be there because you know it's coming at seven o'clock why because you have the schedule hallelujah and we have the schedule what schedule the word of god the word of prophecy we have seen how god has been working all the way up through the church age there not be another one this is the end hallelujah there'll not be another angel or messenger this is the end and the only thing we have listen if it wasn't true if this wasn't true then he was not like john the baptist he was not elijah you understand me because once elijah introduced jesus elijah was taken off the scene amen y'all hear me and once this elijah introduced jesus christ he said that's my lord hallelujah and a word oh my god was given to him to feed us because his whole purpose was lord i desire to dress the bride of jesus christ and god gave him the word those seven thunders and everything that comes with it was the bride's dress it really is oh yes we've got something the world don't have and then we take it for granted are you serious do you realize what time it is hallelujah it's putting on comet time it's preparing yourself amen because remember he said in a moment in the tweaking of an eye you won't even be able to get ready one two in the bed one taken two in the field one taken that's the way it goes your time of preparation is now hallelujah listen but you know what the truth of the bounty is we've got to love one another that's right that's right romans 13 10 says through 14 says love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfillment of the law and there's something and we find it so difficult to do but if you got god in you because god is love and the point is if you find in the difficult is when you with you refusing to say lord not my will like i have a new saying i am a worshiper of the word amen that's me i worship the word hallelujah therefore love is the fulfillment of the law and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is your salvation nearer than when we believe the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light not put on not put on the works of darkness cast them out let us walk earnestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness and not in chambering and wanting this not in strife and envying but put it on the lord jesus christ what if i put him on that's all you're going to see put him on put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof amen and that's where we fight don't we amen we fight don't you think you're gonna get rid of your flesh until he gets rid of it and as long as you got this old man you're to have to die daily and you're going to have to willfully desire to not do evil hallelujah just give him a little inch and he'll take a mile that's what my mom used to say you can't give the devil a edge boy you give the devil an inch he's going to take a mile and that's the truth he doesn't know where to stop he drives you as far as he can take you right put you on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof galatians 3 galatians 3 27 for as many of you as been baptized into christ have put on christ that's the whole armor of god now i'm not going to be able to finish this because i've got a lot more but i want to read this because i want you to know by god's grace we're living in the day you got to make sure you're not tied to traditions and systems things of that nature you got to understand that i do what i do because i love god and his word tells me so not because i've got somebody ruling over me you understand me that's not right god made you free you're not a prisoner not to me and no one else right i'm your pastor but i'm also your brother right it takes the same blood to save me that it's going to take to save you same blood i'm no different right i'm just like paul said the least of all and i'm we all still say by grace people say well i don't know brother we say so i'm predestinated but predestination is predestined by your choice it's what you choose to do and what you have chosen to do and god knows what you have chosen to do before i heard the prophets just said it today on proving his word you've got to choose and because you chose this message it's the reason why you chose this message because he saw you choosing him amen yes you know like i was telling somebody the other day i said some people think oh oh it was predestinated when i married her it was god predestinated it and and you married the devil god don't predestinate you to marry a devil when god told you to be not to be unequally yoked that was your choosing here working towards your good y'all understand me yeah it's the truth don't tell me god is causing you to sin god don't cause you to sin why do you think the prophet god said you got to be careful you got to be prayerful you got to look and make sure the one you marry is yours it came from god why would he tell you that if god didn't already ordain what you you know no it don't work like that now god will show you your bride or your vice versa he showed me mine so god will do it listen let me go ahead and y'all got quiet on me that because a lot of times y'all think if i stumped my toe god predestinated it no you just wasn't looking down he might he might heal your toe but he didn't make you stomp your toe why would when you stomp your door what do you say that old devil we put it on the devil and the reason why we stumped it is because we weren't looking down oh god help us lord i'm just giving this this is just common sense folks this is just what we do right what would be the punishment what would be the punishment of the harlot in her children well it's going to be twofold first he said i will cast her into a bed according to the last part of verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or the great tribulation that is exactly what jesus said in matthew 25 1-13 there were ten virgins five were wise and five were foolish the five wives had all that means the holy spirit but the other five did not when the cry went out went up behold the bridegroom coming the foolish had to run seeking oil while the wise virgins went in to the marriage do you understand that that means people who are seeking the holy that's why you got to be careful that's why if you can get it you better get it now because there's a time when the door is going to be shut and you won't be able you can cry until you've got no more tears once that door is shut that means you can't get in that's the truth because they were dilatory you know they were slowfall about what they needed to do and they ran out of oil these were christians now they weren't just sinners these were christians when the cry went up behold the bible coming the foolish went out had to run seeking oil while the wise virgins went in to the marriage for the five that remain outside were left to the great tribulation that is what will happen to all who do not go up in the rapture that's right that is what will come upon the harlot and her daughters secondly it says that he will kill them with death or as literally translated says let them be put to death with death there is a strength this this this is a strange saying we might say let a man be put to death by hanging or by electrocution or some other way but this says let them be put to death by death you see because death itself is the cause of their death spiritual death is the cause of their death you love the lord yes yes and in the face of all this doubt proving his word is that god does go right on provide proving his word to be right as he has in every age unbelief doesn't stop god it doesn't hinder him i don't care how much the world unbelieves it'll still it's still going to happen unbelief doesn't do anything but condemn the unbeliever amen the unbelief will send the unbeliever to hell it'll rob him of every blessing god provided amen to him but it doesn't hinder god from going right on with the believer see unbelief doesn't stop god it only stopped the unbeliever you got to understand you can't stop god people can't stop god they thought they could stop him even in the romans day when they put him in that tomb and roll the stone away rolled the stone up to the tomb they thought if the roman seal was there nothing could be broke can break it but they didn't understand the god who ripped the curtain the veil and twain was the same god amen that rolled away the stone nobody can stop god i don't care how intellectual people get i don't care if they say oh and you know what kills me oh what gets me sometime and i hate to use that word killed it doesn't kill me but what really gets next to me is when i hear people searching and looking and saying we need to find out where we came from we need our origin i mean even in scientists they have found out that in every man in your dna there's a i wish i could scientifically explain it but it it it it's in the hebrew language all the way back it's in three the major three languages uh in your body it says god in a body that's in you that's what's what's supposed to be in you god in the body because that's what was in adam god in the body that was what was in jesus god in the body that was what was in the children of the the day of pentecost it was god in the body and at the end is going to be god in a body amen that's what it's all about children of god because god is in the body and we must prepare if they had to circu if they had to sanctify everything in the temple in the old shadows and types don't you think don't you even dare think that those shadows and types meant nothing everything has to be sanctified your heart had to be sanctified you know what probably god said in closing he said you see through your heart you see through your heart if your heart is pure everything you see will be pure if your heart is corrupt you you're gonna see corrupt things you understand me you judge things by this and this is what you see when you judge and it doesn't even mean that what you're seeing with your heart is correct you understand me let's stand is that right you say well what do you mean brother brooks let me say it like this remember the woman with the purple nails purple hair purple everything he was seeing through his heart the prophet my prophet was seeing through his heart and says lord why don't you just wipe her off the face of the earth huh god had to correct it y'all understand me we all need correction and i won't correct you i don't want to think i'm right and i'm wrong but i want it and the thing is he was seeing with his heart and god says that got to be correct because i want you to understand the same blood that saves you is the same blood that saves her and you don't even know her background but i do that's right hey then he goes and talk to her and she said you know i once was a christian i once was a methodist she had to touch god somehow some way because god never forgot about him and that's one thing i love about god the bible says that god all all god will not leave one behind it doesn't care what condition you're in at this point in time because if you're meant to make a rapture god is going to force the issue amen he's going to force it and you know what i said to the people of god why would you believe anything else ah none of us is worthy the scripture says when the lamb needed to take the book john says uh who's worthy to take the book he said there was none in heaven there was none in the earth there was none above the earth there was none nowhere worthy and john began to weep because there was no one worthy john knew he wasn't worthy how in the world john got to heaven and knew he wasn't worthy but he was dead [Music] the boys say don't weep john i love that scene the line of the tribe of judah has prevailed john said he looked round to see a lion that's what brother brown said you got to keep sweet meek and sweet and that's what people don't want to do they're ain't gonna let a lot of run over me no just sweet and meekness you gotta be a lamb because when he turned he saw not a lie in the land and that's the nature god is looking for right now you and i must become lambs of god if you're going to be in the lamb's book of life you must become a lamb and the only way that you and i can become a lamb is that we be born in birth by the lamb who is jesus christ himself you love the lord it's not hard like i was telling somebody the other day you say let go how do i do that is it difficult you see this no in your mind you make it you make it difficult because there's something that still won't hold to it but when you make up your mind to let go look how simple this is but just as simple as it is to let it go it's still simple enough i can pick it back up see but once you let it go you got to leave it there let the janitors clean it you see what i'm saying does it hurt oh especially if there's something deep the bible said you know when you see you've ceased from sin you're going to suffer when you cease from disbelieving there's suffering that comes with it amen it comes it's part of it can you you and i cannot measure up to the suffering that christ went through and that's all i'm saying we gonna suffer it's all part of it but you know what god in our suffering the bible said we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he can be touched if you allow him to and don't feel bad because you suffer remember there's always somebody that's suffering more than you i tell you i thank god for the trials that god i go through because i know people i think about my precious brother and i hope he wouldn't mind me say this brother ronaldine spencer that suffers all the time he's a powerful preacher and god anoints his preaching and many people many souls have gotten saved under his ministry but i he have gone through one trial after another i mean sickness is near death and cancer even when it wasn't him his wife went through cancer situations and and his his in-laws and i mean just always seemed like and you know i just settled it in my mind i said god because i know this brother loves you i said there are some people who are ordained to suffer paul was ordained to suffer and all of those disciples that followed jesus had no idea when they first joined up with him that they was going to have to give their lives forth but many of them suffered this is a way of the cross this is the way of the cross it's not easy but i just want to encourage you i want to encourage you tonight that no matter what you go through don't let go or don't put yourself in a place where he has to let you go you understand what i'm saying because god is real and he's rich in mercy he's rich in grace and you know i look at myself and the things that i've gone through it's been difficult it's been hard but you know what [Music] i'll take my cross i'll let you take yours i carry mine and i know you ordained to carry yours and think about it people i get so excited sometime and i have to fight back tears because i realize it ain't long we don't have much longer here you know god is faithful my grandson had a wonderful day in school today praise the lord for him praying for little judah satan you're defeated nothing could stop god we've dedicated him to the lord and no matter what he goes through as this young man we know god is in his soul and that's something you can't take from him father we pray for judah that you use him in such a way that he'll put the devil to shame bless him now strengthen him in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen
