it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nine moses and all the people unto the land which i do give to them even to the every children that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that i have given unto you as i said unto the lord hallelujah from the wilderness and this lebanon and even into the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea towards going down [Music] be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses no shall thou divide for an the land which i swear unto the father [Music] [Music] to the right hand or to the level that thou may prosper whether ever [Music] this book of the law shall not depart out of thy name but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou may have observed you according to paul that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way christ prosper us right and then thou shalt have good success this book of the law shall not depart out of thy name but thou shalt meditate therein day and night the doubt may be observed to do according to all that is written therein amen for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous did y'all understand amen to meditate and to read and to listen to this message which is the law that was given unto us then thou hallelujah make thy wife [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] and we this morning [Music] [Applause] no matter how low the people may [Music] [Music] that your grace will find a place in our souls and that you would lift up lift us up from where we are to where we belong help us here this morning as we glorify your name we give you praise we give you glory in your lovely name jesus christ have thine own way this morning amen amen you may be seated if you want to know what part one was about those of you who can uh understand english i pray that you would listen to part one i think it's still on youtube um but by god's grace we come at a a a great time you know we often say this is a terrible time but in reality it's a wonderful time but if we would take god and his word that word in itself will build a wall of fire about us it will keep the enemy from penetrating our souls or our spirits and therefore it would give us a more prosperous life hallelujah we come at a time [Music] we understand that the seals have been opened god is not looking god is not looking jude uh for a formal church you need this for man he's not looking for systematic worship but god is looking for life and the bible tells us when i see the blood i will pass over you well the blood is not a literal blood but it is the life of god and brother branham calls that blood hallelujah it is a part of god that has been rotated off of god and has been weakened into your soul that's what god will pass over he'll not play play christians judy for papa like they got the holy ghost hallelujah he's only going to pass over those who's bearing god this is the life of christ the holy spirit hallelujah that is nothing but the truth understand me because i know some of y'all don't know me you don't understand me i don't take sides let me say it like this i just wanted to come to you i am about seeing what brother branham preached scripture live in this church i'm not about traditions just i'm not about what you feel about it only about what the word of god says it's supposed to be in this day y'all understand me so we can get this clear i don't know what what brother branham has spoken of this day i believe it with all my heart i'm looking for a supernatural church i'm looking for a church that is in his image no matter what it takes hallelujah i told the lord a few months ago i said god drew the house need cleaning la mison absolutely i don't know who and i don't know what y'all understand just like god is yours and we've got to become more serious about this message now those things were not in my notes but the work will be done luther the book is open you leave it to there and we see the future he's giving us a glimpse of the future brother you saw the preview of the bride [Music] hallelujah is that right and the bible says where the the bible says he whom the son is set free is free indeed illegally understanding so is we satan has no right satan keep you in bondage if you want to go free god said he's already made a way [Music] [Music] if you want to be no matter what he planned against you people don't worry what god says no weapon against you shall prosper how many of us believe that this morning i believe that with all of my heart nothing can stop the believers this day the book is open you leave [Music] he said i will give you [Music] the resurrected lord jesus is here he is here in his power he is here in the redemption power no matter are you gonna argue with him are you going to argue with the prophet of god he said he's here to see amen you understand me nobody's fault but your own if the power of god is not with you nobody's but your own and more than likely the problem is selfishness the problem of selfishness the [Music] no matter how so i want you to understand there is no excuse you can't get the holy ghost being me you can't get it you can't get the holy ghost being selfish without this voice you can't even you can't get the holy ghost we we we're not here to judge our neighbors and that judge is the word hallelujah and as long as we stay in the words it's not us judging it's the word [Music] discovered gold and he had a pet dog on on and that dog kept him safe all his life that dog was faithful and when the man discovered gold he figured he didn't need that dog no more of the holy ghost because the dog knew that there was a thief on the outside [Music] but the dog kept barking that's where it is with the holy ghost he ain't going to shut up until you read him from your life so the man got angry with the dogs [Music] that voice will continue to warn you [Music] if you don't love the holy ghost don't warn you anymore and so did the man die was he more because the thief came in killed him and took his gold yep no hallelujah you love the lord don't be dismayed i'm not preaching this message i'm preaching this message i'm exposing satan i don't know what your lives are but if there's any way that god can speak you to you this morning that he will trusting that he would grant us the spirit of repentance i don't care who's sitting next to you nobody can put you into heaven don't be ashamed if the holy hallelujah yes so amazing now for you coming to our text god said moses is dead but he's not talking about the message moses preached he said god will have an invincible army hallelujah and he also says you and i need a refilling every day because i have a great meal today maybe i'll eat a little bit of steak and all that kind of stuff but tomorrow i'm going to need to eat again and that's what how he taught his his disciples to pray is this out of the mouth of god [Music] something for today [Music] don't be afraid of this thing oh but god has made it for you
