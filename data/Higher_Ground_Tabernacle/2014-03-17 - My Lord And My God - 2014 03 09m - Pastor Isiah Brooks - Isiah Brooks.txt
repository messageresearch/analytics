but he said unto them except I shall see in his hands the prince of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side I will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said Peace be unto you remember eight days later now then said he to Thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing now he said to Thomas don't be faithless now I want you to do this but you

again not just once in a lifetime he'll do it as many times as you need him to do it he'll do it again sure we love the Lord we thank him for his Amazing Grace is is amazing we're living in the time of translation the Holy Spirit has been here for us but we need to be here for him we are living in a time things are moving so fast but nothing has occurred by chance everything has been predestinated well planned by God and just think about it you and I are hard we're part of this plan God just didn't throw in some things to see whether it would fit but he well planned this thing and even though it may seem like the enemy is perhaps getting the best of you there is no way that he can Triumph because that was also planned and the victory has already been won now we want to say that we have all declared Jesus Christ as our savior but I wonder as a brother said to me the other day God was showing him you you know this but how much do you know about me what is it that you know about me uh that can give you the assurance and the Bold stand that we could read in the old test men and see how these men who were like you and I were able to stand in times of adversities No Doubt but they were able to hold fast their faith and their integrity in a time when most men would have failed but what the difference was and is is that their Faith had become come sight in other words spiritually they knew who they were serving and they understood that the god that they served was God Amen but we find out amen that there are so many Christians who follow Christ with their mouth they believe he is but in their hearts they haven't come to know him as God now we find out that Phillip was uh Thomas was one of the the disciples that followed Jesus three and a half years no doubt he was in the mixture when Jesus told him about the crucifixion how he was to die how he was to rise again but for whatever reason Thomas had a spirit of of unbelief he had a hard time having faith in the words of Jesus Christ he was there no doubt when they called him to uh question and when they captured him in the Garden of Eden uh excuse me uh uh Gethsemane and we find out by the grace of God Amen Thomas was one of the ones that scattered but at the resurrection Jesus began to appear to some of his disciples they saw him prior to his death turn water into wine they saw him Open the Eyes of the blind there was one by the name of Peter who who walked upon water because he said God if this be you B me come and he said come so they had seen the miraculous they had never seen any man do such a thing like this man was doing so much so they were on the sea and the enemy amen was in the mixture of the waves and the clouds and the winds and the Bible tells us amen that that that this ship that these people were in they were about to sink at least that's what they thought but Jesus was in the midst of the boat and they cried out Master carth thou not that we perish see there was still element of God or Jesus Christ they didn't see they saw him as a miracle worker but could he do this this is the elements of the of of the atmosphere this is not just a a a man or or a child but this is something we can't see it's invisible something's moving this thing and can he Christ amen put an end to this situation and then when he got up he stood up like a man in in the boat but he stood up like a man and he rebuked the winds he rebuked the waves and said peace be still and his disciples still didn't get it they said what manner of man is this at that point in time they didn't see a man it wasn't a man that spoke to the wind it was God Almighty that spoke to the wind but in their mind they said what manner of man brother said he got it they got it wrong even then and now we find him resurrected in a place by the grace of God where you know the disciples most of them didn't believe at first but Jesus had to visibly show them because remember amen when Mary ran to the disciples and said he's alive he's alive they say surely something's wrong with you you must have seen something different you know I know you emotionally stirred but how could it be but remember he said yes sir after the third day Hallelujah I Rise Again see he wanted to show them that Not only was he the son of man Not only was he uh uh the Christ but he was godall the Bible tells me that he didn't knock at the door 8 days before he came through the wall or came through the door he heard what thas said Hallelujah come on somebody that's my Lord that's my God Amen the Bible said he even knows the secrets of the heart the very intent of your heart God already knows you see we're not serving a denominational God people we are we're serving the true and living God who is Jesus Christ himself somebody amen this morning got to know what I'm talking about amen so we find out amen he comes through the door and he didn't he didn't address nobody else he comes right to Thomas and he said Thomas in other words I heard what you said eight days ago Hallelujah but I want you to know amen who I am so I'm going to put you to the test Thomas and right now I don't need your unbelief you're not seeing a spirit you're seeing a God man and he said listen I want you to thrust your hands into my wounds into my side and I want you to leave amen after Thomas did that Thomas questions were answered he said my Lord and my God now listen amen it took all of that for Thomas to see that he was Lord and God Amen when all of the other disciples had already four random is that right they saw him as being Lord and God hallelujah come on somebody amen he said don't be afraid this is not a spirit give me some fish Hallelujah can a f can a spirit eat like this see y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but let me put it this way a lot of us don't know him like that some of us still got Thomas's amen the spirit of Thomas anointing us and we've got a find a way out of this thing but he said to Thomas blessed is the one who have not seen and yet believe so now the Bible said blessed are they those of those those who follow you Thomas who have not seen this but believe blessed is a man who's never believed or seen the PF fire but believe it blessed is a man who's never seen the cloud but believe it blessed is a man who's not seen in the son of man but believe it blessed is that man hallelujah what do you know about him you know he's my savior a lot of times we fail to see he's more than [Music] that surely he's our savior but I want to say this this morning he's God the Bible said listen I want you to listen carefully the word of God said there is no other God beside him so everything else is either wnab bees everything else is imposters or however you want to put it but there's only one God oh it's the truth the Bible tells us amen that there is no other name according to Acts 4:12 that a man could be saved but the name of Jesus Christ now we want to lift that name we want to raise that name this morning you see that's the problem we haven't been working the name we haven't been raising the name Hallelujah but there is no other name like I was talking with a brother and I say it all the time you can say God you can say Allah you can say buha but don't say Jesus Hallelujah and I want you to understand that demons are not even afraid to that name until you put it all together you got to say in the name of Jesus Christ because there's a lot of jesuses out there Hallelujah now I know what I'm talking about I didn't understand it when I was a younger fellow a younger Christian but I could remember for whatever reason I see things at times I could remember laying on my bed there in my house there in in Columbia South Carina and a demon I saw it coming before I could get up I wasn't asleep I was wide awake and that thing P pinned me down the most hideous thing I ever seen in my life and I kept praying God whatever that is don't let it into me you know and then what happened is I said amen I finally got y'all know how it closes your mouth anybody know what I'm talking about when you're attacked by a demon oh y'all act like y'all don't know I hope you don't ever have to find that one out cuz it ain't a it ain't a nice feeling amen and anyway I was trying to get the name of Jesus I got the name of Jesus out that demon didn't even move you see was I was still in denomination I was calling on that Jesus Hallelujah come on come on if it doesn't make a difference why did the Sons of ska say I want to call on the name of the god that Paul preach see because you got to understand there's a difference in Jesus and in the real Jesus and that's the thing that's wrong with people a lot of us are still calling on a denomination of Jesus when the revelation of the true Jesus Christ has come I L somebody I wouldn't I couldn't move but when I said in the name of Jesus Christ that things went away Hallelujah it burst it moves so fast it moved faster than it came Hallelujah there's power in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah come on somebody but nevertheless there's no other name given among men where we must be saved by the name of Jesus what does he mean to you who is he to you even Christ himself in the book of Isaiah 433rd verse chapter 11th verse he say I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior Hallelujah mama can't save you Daddy can't save you no religion can save you the only person that can truly save you is the Lord Jesus Christ himself this might sound a little Elementary to you but I'm working with the seals right now I'm working with that that that Revelation that was open to us that we didn't know we had to have a prophet to come out and say come out of her my people and be not partaker of her sin because she's not worshiping Hallelujah she's not worshiping the true Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah she's been led into an illusion she don't even know what she's worshiping Hallelujah come on somebody now I want you to understand we in this last day needed an entrance and you and I would have never known he we we saw him in the Book of Revelation the thir chapter knocking at the door trying to get into your heart Hallelujah you know in the church age had done put him out but he said whosoever will whosoever would open up this door he said I come into you and I serer Hallelujah what was it it was the door of your heart Hallelujah is that right we didn't realize but brother Bram amen he comes along and he actually interprets the interprets the painting of the hofman head knocking at the door come on he said the he said the latch wasn't on the outside Jesus ain't going to just open your door you've got the latch you've got the the ability to open the door to Jesus So when you say Lord Jesus come in you must make sure that the door is open amen glory to God is that all right then we come and find out amen that without this message you don't know the way in right huh we didn't understand that Peter was was telling us amen that God had made an entrance that there was a Ministry coming that God would open up the door and wake a way for us to enter into him Hallelujah he to enter into how however you want to look look at it because here Peter second Peter said amen 1114 so an ENT shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom and without Malachi 4 you and I would have never known the entrance we would have been out listen we do that they came to the door even the foolish virgins but they had no way of going in because they rejected oh come on somebody the key to the door is that all right amen we find out by the grace of God Amen this interest was made unto us that after we believe after we receive that we will be sealed Hallelujah a process of God Amen must take place amen oh in your hearts Hallelujah ain't God good to us hallelujah I've got a quotee here I want to read in just a moment but I don't want to get ahead of myself because I want you to know he must become not only your Lord but your God and Lord is ruler Lord is ruler Paul said I'm a prisoner Hallelujah I'm a prison amen I don't have a will of my own I can't do what I want to do I can't go what I want want to go amen I don't have a mind he is my mind what does it mean to you we're living in an age amen I said last week amen a age of insanity Satan Satan's desire amen is to totally send you insane and a lot of time people say like I said last week amen you people insane the most of them are outside they are solemn you know they they folks think that the bad ones amen is the ones that are locked up no no no no the ones that are the worst are the ones who appear to be sa but they're insane come on somebody y'all better know what I'm talking about y'all think last summer was bad you wait till this summer comes amen it's going to be beyond anything you've ever seen in your life the nakedness of people the insanity of people brother bam said he called these things he says hideous sites and I never knew it but look so bad when he when he said hi to your sight I thought monstrous things and that's what we're looking at Souls that are in prison Souls who are demon-possessed come on somebody wait a minute wait a minute let me show you something I I stumbled at this scripture the other day I I didn't when I say stumbled stumbled on it if Psalms 58 3-5 says even from birth the wicked go astray from the womb they are wward and speak lies see from birth you Wicked from birth you just don't oh that little cute little angel he might or she might look like an angel but whatever the seeds in her will determine what she'll be y'all hear what I'm saying if she got a bad seed in the beginning that's what you have in the end oh come on somebody oh it's the truth said their venom is like the Venom of a snake in one place it said like a Cobra that has stopped his ears you know how people amen they can come and they can pretend like they're hearing and you know they're not hearing because their ears are stopped and no matter how the charmer tried to charm them amen no matter how skillful the preacher is they will not obey that's just the way it is that's the way it is because you know they like I say snakes most of them they don't hear anyway that's why you better be glad you got ears to hear oh Lord what do you know of him it's something that have knowledge of we've got knowledge of the president and the things what we've heard maybe some we don't like some of us but knowledge is one thing but to know him is a different thing and there are so many Christians that have knowledge of him but they don't know him do you know him do you know him I heard a song say he's the son of David the Seed of Abraham Stone him out the mountain he's a Meek and humble lamb do you know him he'll wash your tears away he'll turn your night into Day do you know him see and that's the thing and then the question is has always been do you know him but now I'm bringing it to a deeper point do he know you Hallelujah see God like I said didn't just do this thing he did it in such a powerful way now I want you to understand every one of us are going through some TR type of transition it might like you see may seem like your life is at its worst right now but so it was with Samson and he looked at this thing with the possibility said I I I got to go for it Hallelujah it might be the only chance I have and this is where God is putting you right there with a possibility you at your worst point but there's a possibility you can do better Hallelujah he took that possibility and said listen it's going to cause my death and like I said in my Sunday school people well if you commit suicide you're going to hell that's not true Samson committed suicide and he said purposely I'll die with the Enemy Hallelujah he knew what he was doing he knew the battle was going to cause his death Hallelujah and he died with the Enemy and that's what God is saying to you this morning amen you must die with your enemy even if look like it's suicide to yourself die with your enemy cuz every one of us got one or two or three or four or five huh you know what's troubling you you know what's holding you back come on somebody well I don't know you do know why because it's God's purpose to let you know he purposed you like he did Samson destroy the Philistine and whatever demons are disturbing you tormenting you you have been ordained to destroy it amen and if you don't destroy it it will destroy you but you got to cry out on this one Hallelujah people think they going to go go making it sweeping through the city you sweep right through and out amen if you if you don't get it right now Hallelujah y'all I'm going have to read here just a bit is that all right things that are to be he said you were all pre-planned by God nothing happened by chance with God woo oh God how could this happen to me nothing happens by chance Hallelujah with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned plannned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that oh you're not a mistake sir God Don't Make Mistakes now I'm saying that that's not in the quote I'm not he doesn't make he you you a play the way you look the way you act your makeup everything about you I'm so sad it is so sad so sad I know I know you wish you was better but you see he had to make you that way so that you can know what better is he's the only one that's better right you can't even get better until you get better on the inside and that's Jesus Christ in you he goes on he says think that just think that you at one time I'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then you were put in the beding ground in the womb of a mother through holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed in the image like your father then there's Fellowship see you can't even have Fellowship until you come into His Image right come on somebody amen so now the only way that you can be a son and daughter of God because you have to be to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always sometime HH always and if you and I were there always you and I will always be there Hallelujah the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule see and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God oh but brother Brooks I have so much trouble God ain't talking about your flesh your flesh ain't no Gene not God's Gene he talking about the in man the inward man that man that let you know when you're wrong that man that makes you repent that man that breaks your heart when it's hard that man that man that's God in you am and we need to start acknowledging him Hallelujah come on somebody cuz if it was out of us you know the word of God said no man sought him we all went astray not one man sought God hallelujah it was God seeking you my lord and my God come on you got to know him now you expressed and after his word has come in you to light up this age I'll be done in a minute you are expressing God's life in you that's what the light come for that's what the revelation of this message come to do to light up this age and you become the light expressing God life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God there before you get what I mean see you are you are now made you're setting in this church tonight or today because your duty listen your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood wherever you are associated am your duty your your job wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you got eternal life then there always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here oh my goodness I remember seeing my brother in South Africa there when I was ministering how would I I would have never known he would be here what is no coincidence God saw it even when he and I didn't know we'll see each other again that's the truth am I'm in Iowa I hate cold weather thank God it won't be none there and I get over y hallelujah amen but God placed me here for this moment oh come on somebody a no way I don't care how pretty I is I would have never moved up here on my own accard but when God has something for you so you got to know you've been sent here for a purpose come on somebody and the devil has been whooping us some of us and keeping us so distracted till we're like Samson we forgotten our purpose you said well I got this demon cuz God ordained it for you huh God ordained it because he knew you have something on the inside in the last day to overcome it you will defeat the dev he's already defeated but he needs somebody to take courage he need somebody like Samson to say Lord Oh Lord once more once more Lord once more here the man who commits suicide in the Hall of [Music] Fame he had rather die with his enemy knowing he destroyed his enemy his enemy didn't destroy him he destroyed his enemy I ain't telling nobody to go out there and kill themselves now that ain't what I'm saying devil interpreting that to you he's a liar Hallelujah but what I'm saying You must die to your natural desires your natural identity oh come on somebody you must die to being born like myself a brook Hallelujah I've been born again and my name amen is named after him oh ho ho ho and if there's power in his name that means I'm traveling in power that means you're traveling in power Hallelujah come on somebody now the Bible says amen according to 2 Peter 3:18 said but we but grow in Grace we're not supposed to stand still we supposed to grow hallelujah amen the whole time you know God a here said keep licking your wounds no sir grow in Grace the grace is given to you all of us desire should have been dead by now wiped off the map because of our Disobedience but the grace of God has been extended to it come on somebody what does he mean to you huh come on he's my Lord and he's my God hallelujah not one of you not one of us amen could have married Heaven anybody know what I'm talking about the Bible said according to Revel ation amen the 5th chapter fourth verse that was no man worthy none Hallelujah not the pope not the king not the prince not the no man was worthy to lose the seal to not even look upon it you know what I mean don't even look you're not even worthy to look at it now think about it think about this if you wasn't worthy to look at it then what makes you worthy now Hallelujah makes you worthy to hear things that ought to be to hear the message Shalom Hallelujah come on somebody to hear the message this world is falling AP what makes you worthy Hallelujah Jesus Christ the Lamb of God the one who opened the book woo he made you worthy so if I'm worthy amen I'm going to read it I'm I'm going to eat it I'm going to study it I'm going to bathe in it I'm going to wash in it I'm going to do everything I can to get it all so I I just want it to be me that's who I am help us Lord It's a benefit it's a privilege what a privilege what a privilege amen when the world calls us crazy Samson had a transition he went through a lot of suffering before he could come to it and maybe that's what the problem that's what's going on in our life maybe we got to go through a little more extensive you know in our suffering before we recognize amen this is not what I'm supposed to be this is not where I'm supposed to be I am not a loser I am not to be defeated because great is he that is in me than he that is in the world I am more than a conqueror amen through Christ Jesus who loved me I'm not supposed to be here oh Lord I look toward the heal with cometh my help my help comes from the Lord see that's where go Hallelujah that's where God wants us we get to that place you got something then you ready to battle the devil no matter how many how what the odds are Hallelujah you're ready Hallelujah to go all the way with Jesus when you come to that place Samson had to come recognize he had to recognize that de God was not God hallelujah de God got no business ruling over me Hallelujah come on somebody G de God ain't got no business ruling over me hello that demon in my life ain't got no business ruling over me you've got to come to that place to recognize your God is the ruler H come on you know what savior is that means to be saved from something Hallelujah is that all right come on Isaiah 45:21 say tell ye bring them near ye let them take counsel together who have uh declared there there from uh HH ancient truth who have told it from the that time have not I the lord and there is no God else beside me in other words he says I've told you everything I done told you the beginning I done told you the ending Hallelujah I told you how it started I told told you how it was going to end Hallelujah I told you where I he you I he you in the last book of life Hallelujah I don't told you everything anybody else any other God has been able to do that come on somebody no other God can show you where you come from and where you're going nobody but the Lord Jesus Christ is that all right the Bible according to St John said all things were made by him and without him there was nothing made nothing then God the Creator is that all right you say I know him as a savior but do you really know him as a savior like I said earlier Peter said Lord if that bid me come Hallelujah anybody have ever you walked on the waters for a while I've walked on the waters and there have been times I found myself looking around Hallelujah and I had to say Save Me Lord hallelujah and he did he might have rebuked me a little bit but he did it anyhow Hallelujah he saved me for drowning Hallelujah and sinking into worldly Affairs and things of that nature is that okay Hallelujah ain't God good to us oh my God thank you Jesus thank you Jesus hallelujah what about it he said oh my brother I said do you really know what a savior is I tell you what I tell you what that woman that was caught in adultery she knew What A Savior Hallelujah come on somebody amen she was caught in the very Act they brought him to Jesus said what shall we do with this woman we caught her in the very act Hallelujah come on when sin caught me let me tell you something if it wasn't for the grace of God I would be a soul screaming in hell right now Hallelujah because I'm going tell you something I I I I I was just as bad as this woman sin had overtaken me and many times amen death tried to take me y'all heard my story I was in a club and I got amen alcohol poison ready to go out a new death was standing right there Hallelujah but God had mercy on me y'all hear what I'm saying God have mercy on me and because of that I'm

savior I know what he's saving me from and that was just a tip off the iceberg when he saved me from my sins Hallelujah he just didn't halfway do it he did it all the way the uttermost not the allmost the uttermost called in adultery I love this scene because you know all of us still have that finger pointing oh my God help me Jesus help me Jesus help me Jesus we can look at somebody that's faulty and failing and we say well look at that and look at that and look at that and God said you put away the pointing of the finger I hear you yes sir Hallelujah you're just in a bad shape yourself it's

that's all right y'all think y'all just going to walk with on a a bed a Rosy bed of e it's going to be sweet sweet sweet it ain't going to be that you've been called to battle Hallelujah you've been called to fight amen let me tell y'all something y'all think y'all let me put it this way you and I hadn't seen nothing when the squeeze come let me tell you something you're the only sane people that's left Hallelujah If you deny this gospel you're insane Hallelujah ain't nobody I guarantee you the people who didn't believe in hell and they're now there are believers everybody in hell is a Believer but it's too late you got to believe it now people but if you are seed you will now I go back to that you see oh Lord I want you to know what a savior he's a rescuer anybody been rescued amen come on somebody he's a [Music] rescuer hallelujah amen you look at our brother con there he con brother con was rescued Brother Rich was rescued that's the truth it wasn't the amulance that saved him it wasn't a doctor it was Jesus Christ Hallelujah to God be all the glory amen rescued amen when you're on a bed of Affliction you can't help yourself God come comes down is that all right amen when you're in a place amen that you can't be delivered amen God comes down and rescue you that word means to liberate or to take forcibly Hallelujah come on somebody I love it amen when God comes in like my Superman Hallelujah and he rescues me Hallelujah I remember those little cartoons when I was a boy I used to love it when nail would be rescued amen that old me man with tired to the train track

down to the train track and the train is coming Hallelujah the train of death come on amen God unti you amen rescue you thank you Lord hallelujah amen y'all know what I'm saying you got to know him amen after the experience that the Hebrew boys had let me let me tell you something they knew him then they knew him but now they know him Hallelujah they understood that this God we're serving is not something of a the figment of our imagination he's real how I saw him there he was in the fire with me Hallelujah oo oo oo Hallelujah that's why Daniel paid three times a day Daniel knew what he was talking about Daniel knew what he was working with hallelujah amen he wasn't just working like all those other children of Israel who who said oh we believe in the Jehovah God Daniel knew it and the Jehovah God knew Daniel Hallelujah that's what I'm saying I don't want to just know him but I want him to know me hallelujah amen cuz there's a lot of people he going to say I do not know you Hallelujah ain't God good to us oh my anybody know what it means to be delivered see all that all that in that word savior I I'm going to be preaching on this for a while so you might as well know where I'm working with because a lot of us we got to know him and we we're failing to see him through our trials we think our trials the devil is bringing amen these things on us to God is bringing the on us to punish us no no no he's allowing these things to come up us so you'll know him better you'll know him better as a deliverer as a savior as a friend as a comforter that's why you're going through it knowing him and most of us are missing it we're failing to see that the trials are to bring you closer to God not drive you away is that right Peter exemplified that situation in the midst of a storm saw Jesus walking on the water in the midst of the storm Lord if that be you draw me closer bring me to you Lord hallelujah let me come to you like that brother said when God saved Peter from drowning he didn't have to run out there and pull him out of the water he was right there when Peter lost face he was right in the reach of our arms Lane and many times we fail when God is right there to grab us we fail God thank God he don't give up on us like we so easily give up on him is that all right Psalms 1247 says out of our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the foul we were all in prison all trapped by the devil come on somebody and God came and broke this broke the snare hey Lord I love that I love that I love that I love that amen because if you know anything about you know over there when we would go see Brian Jones and he would find those animals all trapped by these pores and stuff like that you know yeah they'll be wounded they sometime the foot be done you know because of the Trap wounded and broken you know all kind of situations but he'd take them home and nurse them back to hell that's a real Savior and he got you out of the Trap before Satan returned to kill you hallelujah amen ain't God good he's Lord he's God Hal huah and he wants you to know we must come to know that not in our hands in our hearts and believe that scripture that the footsteps of a righteous man is ordered by the lord well brother BRS I don't think I'm righteous you better be you better be he became my sin that I might become the righteousness of God if he took my sin that means I'm his righteousness therefore he looked upon me as I'm a righteous man so therefore he orders my steps oh he couldn't have taken me this way he took you this way he's taking you the way he's taking you don't Grumble don't complain Lead Me Oh Lord lead me my Lord and my God man man my born blind Hallelujah think about it think about it you love the Lord let me read this amen let's go to Psalms 8:22 now I I want you to really think about what was preached this morning because I'mma I'mma add more I'mma bring some more to it this evening but I want you to understand amen that you're not some mishap you know you're not like a Daren Theory you know you came to being by chance you know I I I don't even know how they happen to believe that because amen what what taphole or whatever that crawled up which one of them became male first and then how can it be by chance amen because if it was female who pregnated her to bring forth a male it doesn't make sense then God just happen to to to to make a male and female go through the same changes at the same [Music] time I wish that people understood what they were saying amen taking you all the way to a tap pole you are related to a tap pole that makes no sense but that's what people believe that the that's the insanity that Satan is striking the people with they believ in science over the word like I said yeah I believe in The Big Bang Theory but that was after he said let there be amen so you love the Lord Proverbs 8:22 says the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I will set up from the Everlasting from the beginning of or even the Earth was when there was no depths I was brought forth when there were uh no fountains uh abounding with waters before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth now you got to understand amen that had to be scripture somewhere about predestination that's not just talking about Jesus Christ that's talking about you too why because you were in him you were in him before the foundations of the world I'mma tell you just like this people the only reason why you could ever be holy and that if the Holy Ghost is on you or in you right there is no one of us amen that's holier than thou no sir everybody got to come by the way of the blood but do you know what I'm talking about y'all know what I'm talking about some you know we look at and everybody got this you know and that's the saddest thing this is where Satan is deceiving a lot of people in our day because he's making you think that knowledge is the Holy Ghost Paul said you can understand all the Mysteries and have not charity which is the Holy Ghost it will profit you nothing you don't even have a covenant see but a lot of people don't want to believe that oh I know I I know it I know it where in your or in your heart if it's in your heart it's working its way out of you it's going to work its way out of you but if you just got it in your head it's not going to last how many of us forget sometime and y'all know me if it wasn't for God I don't know where I'd be y'all hear what I'm saying amen so you got to realize I must depend upon him not me I'm not complaining I'm so glad he made me the way he's made me because I know when I get to heaven it was all God oh God nothing I did nothing I merited I I didn't run no win no contest it was the grace of God you love the Lord he possessed me he possessed me I was already there huh you said brother said anybody remember I asked a boy I asked a guy like this we had a conversation when was in the denomination and you know what I someone believe him now but he said he said 'oh I remember when I was in my mother's womb I could remember all the colors and things but I couldn't believe that because at the first I thought there's no light but then I found out there is light I don't understand it but I can tell you what I can remember when I was in diapers anybody else I could remember when I was in diapers now why I could remember things like that and then my short term is so short hallelujah oh yeah I remember laying on the floor on a pallet looking up when a man was coming through my my my my window breaking into our house I could remember my when my sisters were screaming I remember it I remember y'all think I I tell you the truth I was four years old playing hookie from kindergarten that's right didn't want to go there for personal reasons but I unlock my window at home stand at the like they had a screening porch I go in the screening porch and act like I was knocking on the door while my mom going to the bus stop to catch the bus and when she would leave or turn that corner I'm back out the door going into my house in the window four years old not even in in in elementary yet so I know you can go really way back y y y'all think I'm crazy but I'll put it this way let me tell you like this and I won't go in depth to but my grandson Christopher can remember when he was a baby in the nursery he told me I didn't believe him then Christopher came out with something that only God could have showed it made a Believer out of it made a Believer out of me so you got to realize amen there are things that we do remember now think about it we're in the image of likeness of God God remembers all things not really he don't remember your sins I shouldn't have done that but the point is amen you and I must recognize by the grace of God Amen that God remember he can never forget that's what he said right he said I'll never forget you how can I forget you you graving in the palms of my hand Hallelujah but I'm going tell you something the moment you switch over and you believe it's your works that save you you are lost y'all hear what I'm saying the moment you switch over and believe it's your works that save you you are lost we do the works of God because we are saved a cow give milk not to prove it's a cow it gives milk because it is a cow and you and I must recognize oh you said why am I saying this because the the devil takes your joy by stripping you making you faulty you going to always be faulty till Jesus come it is the soul man that God is looking at it is where the blood is laying on the altar in your heart that's what God's looking at your flesh is your flesh come on somebody can anybody stop aging I don't care how much cream you put on it it's going to happen right so my point is can you stop the fs in your in your flesh it's sticky it's going to always be but God said don't even look at that look at the inner man it's what I'm working on right now in you is the Inner Man and the only way you can stop that thing is to crucify him every day you love the Lord amen can I read just one more scripture we we we pick up this evening now this is what I love Isaiah 4011 I'm saying this because I really want you to uh come to the place and say God I got to know you I really have to know you it's not enough to know you in my head and be able to quote the scriptures and quote the prophet whatever the case may be but I got to know you and it's no different than what Paul requested he said I don't I don't just want to know you in the power of your resur Direction he said I want to know you in your suffering I want to know that Lord I want to I want to see you come on the scene I want to say Amen when I was here you was there you know I want to know I want to say Lord now when I was in this pit you brought me up come on somebody I want to I want to be able to testify amen of all the things you've done for me I can declare that you was with me you never Le me never left me you were always there for me see that that that's what God wants us to see he wants us to have confidence I just believe that I believe that Isaiah 4011 said he shall feed his flock Like a Shepherd he should gather the Lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead them that are with young so even mothers and fathers amen those of us we God is leading you God is directing us hallelujah come on he's God and let me tell you something the problem is we're not always aware he's around and he's always around think about it you feel bad because You' done wrong he proved to us that he don't go nowhere he said Peter before they before the C cck Clow three times you deny me he was looking right at Peter when Peter was making all of those Den denal he look right at you when you make all those denials but one thing for certain he can't deny you he didn't say oh Peter you did this and because of that I'm taking the keys no sir he knew that Peter was going to do it before he gave him the keys y'all hear what I'm saying I'm talking about election now I'm talking about election we got to we got to work with that because a lot of time a mean the devil take our joy because we forget election we forget amen that we're just Justified as though we never sin in the first place we forget that he did that the god you serve and he want us to be full of joy he'll lead us he knows how he's leading you well I made a mistake well sure you did you think God didn't know it you think God wasn't there when it happened hello he's here now and I'm so glad that the Bible said we have not a high Prest that cannot be touched by the feelings of our infirmity the Bible said he was likewise tempted in every way but without sin so you ain't got nothing over on God he knows everything you going through oh come on somebody you know and and this is my Lord and my I want you to really think about it I want you to leave here this morning thinking have I made him really my Lord and have I really made him my God and Lord if I haven't made you my lord if you're not ruling me if you if you if you're not the the the the the ultimum of my life help me help me help me I want to know you as God God God God creator of all things God you know we got to know him in you know because when this pressure come guess what all your education will go right out the window I believe that's why Jesus said don't even think about what you're going to say when they deliver you up to the counsel don't even try to meditate on It come on somebody because I'm going tell you this thing is going to be spiritual there'll be such a confusion without God you won't see your way through it bl's stand you got an knowing him and that's from the pull pit to the back of the door he's opening our eyes to know who he really is and to see him for he what he really is to us and what we mean to him right he told Boaz Boaz told told uh Ruth said don't you worry about it now you just going back home to Naomi and I'm gonna fix it for you hello in other words I'm gonna take care from this point on right don't worry about nothing I'm going to take care of it from this point on you've done what you supposed to do you've chosen the hard way you chose that oldtime religion you done that now just go on and I'm going to take care of it for the rest of the time did he do it if he did it then he'll do it now what was he doing showing himself to you to keep you and I from worrying fretting amen because worrying and fretting brings on disease it is harmful to your body father God as we pray we thank you for your your grace and your mercy Lord Lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves Lord to know you as Lord and God it's more than than than than head knowledge so many people who knew more about this message when it comes to understanding Lord better than I but where are they now where are they now they've turned their backs they've walked away and Lord It's not going to even get it's not going to get easier it's going to get harder as we go Lord but I'm so thankful because you have revealed yourself to us Lord I know this is truth maybe I'm not doing all not maybe I know Lord I'm not doing all that I suppose to but God I'd rather die with my enemy than to die of failure help us now Lord help each and every one of us Lord come up to the place where we are ought to be that we might declare who you are in this last and evil day help us now Lord in Jesus Christ name we pray amen he'll do it again for you he'll do it again just take a look and where you are now and where you been hasn't he always come through for you he's the same now there oh you may not know how you may not know when but he'll do it again he'll do it again for you he'll do it again just take a look at where you are now and where You' been hasn't he always come through for you he's

now we're in this transition but it's to take us up and not down amen so believe and trust God ask God for the wisdom whatever you're going through ask God for the wisdom show you show me Lord amen how to defeat the Philistine in my life amen whatever it takes let me die with my enemy amen never let me be a failure Lord but let me Victor be victorious in Christ you know because that's where we are so many people are losing folks they're losing that I wish I could tell you amen how it really is but it's it's it's horrible and and if you don't fight for it you're going to lose it you got to fight for your life now you got to fight for your life amen and that's what God is saying to us this morning amen he wants you to know him in his in your suffering what is he doing for you you know a lot of time in in closing as our brother come give us a song or two a lot of time we don't know what we going through because I always tell us tell the church stop praying then if you want don't want to be just like him don't pray no more right he's answering your prayer and it's not according to the way you think it ought to happen you thinking you're cursed or something you don't pray no more if you don't want him to answer your prayer if you don't want to be like him don't pray no more am I making sense because it's your prayers that God is answering right brother random said it like this she said Israel prayed for a messiah God gave him a baby because that's what they needed but that baby was their Messiah huh amen take what it gives you and move with it that's what we got to learn what we pray for look for the answer whenever it comes take it and move with it sometime you said Lord I want to be better he have to say okay you got a little draw in you so I'm going put a little fire to you don't complain about the fire you ask for it y'all hear what I'm saying give thanks in all things [Music] amen
