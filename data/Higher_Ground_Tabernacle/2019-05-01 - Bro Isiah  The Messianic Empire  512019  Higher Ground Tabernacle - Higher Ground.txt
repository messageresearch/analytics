watched my school and free philosophy Oh I mean [Music] hallelujah you love the Lord I think there's a little warm in here praise the Lord as we stand I need to make a few announcements but I'll do that after the service after the word has come forth revelations the first chapter revelations one we read the fifth and sixth verse of Revelations one there will read revelations five nine through ten revelations one five and six and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and have made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen hmm that's really sweet amen revelations five nine and ten and they sang and they sung a new song saying God worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and Nations and have made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth let us pray I have any father we come before you humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we pray that you would have preeminence tonight Lord I pray God that you would give us uh pterence as your Holy Spirit will move upon us cleanse us from all unrighteousness if there be anything I have said done or thought that would hinder the service father God washes clean forgive us of our sins everything about us is wrong but everything about you was right we say amen to the truth of the word Lord let thy Holy Spirit break in the straw every yoke of the enemy lord I pray that you were quicken our minds our bodies and our souls that we may see you tonight in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated first of all I give honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I think the air is kicked on already I don't know maybe it was just me feeling the fire but I feel okay right now amen we thank God for His goodness we thank God for His grace and I think the more I began to study and the more I began to see this message and who I am what I have come to do and understand my work cannot be work unless I work by him as Jesus Christ Himself said I can't do nothing except the father showed me he worketh and therefore I work it to my Lord saw visions and so he saw and understood exactly what his father wanted him to see but the Bible says that they that are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God I began to see by God's grace that salvation is more powerful than anybody sometimes we just forget how great it is and I think the more we move into it began to venture out into it we'll begin to see that Calvary was more about more than just a man dying raising from the dead but his ministry was a Ministry of reconciliation a ministry of restoring restoring what back to us the things in which we had lost by way of the fall coming into this age of evil age were Satan seemed to dominate the political realm the spiritual realm and seemed like every other Ram the only thing that he does not have control over is the kingdom of God there is an empire but the Branham call it the Messiah Empire and that's what I want to speak on tonight so that we understand that we have come to conquer everything that Satan has done we've come to tear it down we've come to put it under our feet we come to take back and to take over what the thief has stolen from us but the only way that we can accomplish this is that we must have faith in God to believe that we are what he says we are we are not just servants but in the second-handed road brother Branham says that the servant of God has to call on God he has a depend on God not his church not his robe he has to depend on God and God asking him to do the impossible and in order to do the impossible you've got to call on God for power of God to perform the impossible and if we be the Messiah's servant we have to have the Messiah's power and he promised us in the word is that right I am the vine and ye are the branches I energize every branch that brings forth fruits I like that word energize because you can be whipped you could be limps but once energy comes in it restores that branch to its original state you and I must know by God's grace where we come from if we know where we come from as I said a few services ago if you could understand your origin if you can take it back to where you came from then you can understand where you're going it's amazing that even Lucifer who when God created had a different beginning and when I say that he wasn't a part of God as such he was just the creation but you and I was more than what Lucifer started out to be because we are what we say a rotation off of God we were in him and because of Adam's failure in his faults we realized Amen we became perverted creatures that's only only out of shell but inside the inside God protected his heritance 1st Corinthians the 6th chapter 9 through 11 says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind not nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God he goes on and he names all of these things and mine you Paul is talking to the church of Corinthians more than likely most of these people had already been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ perhaps some of them had the holy ghost we're about only God knows but Paul began to just identify all of these fruits of unrighteousness because sometimes we who are under grace take grace for granted and that grace then becomes this grace Corinthians church as we know was full of folly they were what we call a counter church but they yet still belong to God it wasn't that they couldn't be straightened but somewhere they got off the beaten path and Paul said after he named all of these things and said Amen that they would not inherit the kingdom of God he began to say and such were some of you hello and such were not some such you are but sir you were some of you were but ye are washed what was Paul saying these things because we forget that we have become we are can't become to be a new creature not something patched up but a brand new creature but yea washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God now he said in that name and by that spirit there's no other way to be justified there is no other way to be sanctified because remember our righteousness is as filthy rags it has to be the working of the Holy Spirit look what God has done many of us amen can identify with some of these things if not all of these things why because the Bible said we had all sinned and come short of the glory of God and all of this was not a mistake everything has been because God purposed it to be so but you and I we have a greater hope we have something that we can hold on to or rather it holds on to us because the Bible said in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us now that is a love that you and I can not even comprehend that while we were yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly hallelujah that means while we were out there doing what we used to do God had us in line when he was on Calvary hallelujah ha because we're family why because we're family and because we are family he redeemed us just the other day I was thinking about God and thinking about the Lord and thinking about perfection yesterday and the Lord directed me to Joseph and said that Joseph forgave his brethren where did you get those scars where did you get those wounds in the house of your friend and so was it with Jesus Jesus was betrayed and treated bad and mocked by his own brethren but it was there Jesus who hung on the cross and said Father forgive them for they know not what they do and then when I began to see Stephen Stephen means crowd and I looked at that word who said there it is here was Steven an offshoot off our part of the original Church and evidently P of Steven had come to a place where God thought he was ready so that he was ready that he was full of divine love hallelujah before Paul even came to preach it Steven had already reached that place where God wanted him to be how do you know when your crown would divine love you can say like Steven Lord all these things not to their charge you can say like Jesus forgive them father for they know not what they do you can be like Joe's up don't harm yourself God did this for the saving of Israel see that's where God is taking us he's taking us to a place with these little mere lines of ours can't even comprehend we've never gone this way before and God is directing us he's leading us into a perfect place but you and I must have died to our selfishness we must allow the Holy Spirit to uproot every bitterness every anger everything that you have harbored within yourself because let me tell you something those are the kinds of things that clogs up the flue the pipe the place that leads to the area that God wants to get into it's blocked by these ideas in your mind that you have a right to be so hallelujah we have no more rights when we gave our lives to Christ we we fulfill it all of our rights and we gave them to God and therefore we must allow ourselves to surrender to his holy spirit is that all right and when we surrender to him God can then move through your being and he began to shine that light in those dark places and then when is when you overcome when you surrender you overcome because the greatest enemy is you hallelujah so you and I must understand there is an empire something that God is working with he's establishing his kingdom here on earth I thought about how Hollywood celebrates their celebrities the Emmy and the Grammy and whatever kind of else they have out there red carpets and all that and all you see is glamour all you see is Satan's devices hallelujah and they think that those rewards of the greatest thing that they could ever have we are we have a greater ceremonies coming hallelujah that will make these Emmys and these Grammys look like nothing why because we are the celebrities of heaven oh come on honey we are the celebrities is that right Oh most of us we can hardly wait till we see Noah we can't Halle wait till we see Abraham we can't Holly wait till we meet Sarah all of those who have gone on before us and listen people what were they doing they were literally impersonating the Holy Spirit Christ for their day they are the real actors is that right because it was God Christ big in live and praying in the past his purpose was that right it's too true because when Jesus went down into the LA region he asked those who fail to listen to Noah why did not you hear my message that could've easily say but we didn't we don't remember you but he could easily say but yes I was there hallelujah I was a very voice of Noah and when you wouldn't hear Noah you did hear me Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 and they can never be changed God is God and the Bible tells us in this kingdom in this Empire everything works by the name of Jesus Christ there is no other name devices no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus and every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord hallelujah is that right not just in heaven but things on earth things under the earth that means he'll must bow to the name of Jesus Christ that means it meant there's power in that name and the Bible says the whole of heaven and earth is named after him see what I'm saying it is an empire it is a kingdom the ruler of this kingdom is Jesus Christ himself is that right when he rose from the babys is all power in heaven and earth is given unto me and then it began to say ah you shall receive power after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you that's why the devil don't want us to have the real Holy Ghost he doesn't mind if we have religion he doesn't mind if we have church energy he doesn't mind amen we have a isms our schisms outcries out doctrine hallelujah but when it comes to the rear bar he don't want you to have that because he knows that once that comes in he's a defeated foe completely defeated hallelujah he realized at the time that God seals it with the Holy Ghost you become his Lord he doesn't want that hallelujah remember quoted that some time ago brother Brennan said that Jesus Christ defeated Satan at Calvary with sweetness and meekness Oh somebody help me here see people what this is not a time to fight this is not a time to fight it is not a time to be worried about somebody else's doctrine somebody help me here you see because you and I will save by grace and if Satan can get you distracted hallelujah you will be the man that will fall hello because you and I must understand God is moving of people into perfection nothing but perfection not by your might not by your power and not by your spirit is only his spirit hallelujah can we move into the listen is that the truth you can't get into this Empire unless you have the Holy Ghost and you can't go up to heaven and get into heaven unless you have the Holy Ghost hallelujah because his empire is the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but is joy peace and righteousness well in the Holy Ghost when you talk about an empire it city we're working with the supreme power in governing supreme that means there's nothing above it it is the alternate is that there's nothing above it now i'ma say this the Bible said that name of Jesus happen hardly exalted come on Salani I had a young brother say this to me the other day a brother in the message he said I used to be Catholic he said and we admired Mary we worship Mary just like some of the people do brother branham he said and when I see somebody leaning toward that he said I won't even come to church to listen to a preacher that's trying to make him God will somebody help me imma get in trouble here hallelujah because it's really the same spirit you don't have to say Amen but it's true anyhow it is the same spirit there's only one Lord and one Savior hallelujah and his name is Jesus Christ that's what brother Branham preached it is an empire it is a powerful system that God is working in his people but to see God can't use coward soldiers he can use those who want to retreat he can't use those who run with a Worley hallelujah he's looking for a man somebody who's stand straight on his word and be not afraid to call it like it is huh he says now in the Old Testament we know Church was called the kingdom of God he said the kingdom of God now I'm taking this from the chronology of the Bible the Old Testament the church was called the kingdom of God in other words God is a king and the church is his domain God's kingdom Old Testament in the New Testament is called the messianic Empire oh I like that messianic in other words the Messiah's Empire where the Messiah rules and reign no denominational barriers are nothing the Messiah rules in his Empire isn't that wonderful thinking messianic and para therefore the church is not an organization the church is not a gathering of the people the church is the people of God that's been called out of the world to show in another Kingdom five identifications that's where it's located you hear what I'm saying so you saw brothers what do you say God has called us out and now he's calling us in too so that we can become the master of our circumstances hello somebody Jesus was the master of his circumstances there was nothing that could take him of God or make him sin he was the master he was the Lord of all of his circumstances who even when things came upon him unaware because he was a man and there he was entered into his ship the Bible says and his sin side was followed him and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the ways but he was asleep hallelujah that the ship was covered with ways but he was a sheep sleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish can it be can you believe that you in the boat with Jesus and you still thinking you're gonna perish you're in Christ and you still think you're gonna perish no matter what's don't come upon you when you are in Christ there's no way you can perish and he said unto them why are ye so fearful o ye of little faith fearful the Bible says none of the fearful shall enter into that City I'm afraid I'm gonna be low none of the fearful hallelujah I'm afraid I'm gonna fall none of the fearful hallelujah oh ye little slay faith then he rose and rebuked the wind in the sea and there was a great calm hallelujah if you don't fear death that's can take somebody help me here but no she's not a real Eisenmann many people die prematurely because they are afraid of chaos are afraid of death afraid of these diseases but understand this you must become a master you must become a ruler come on somebody he made us kings and priests whew and the King has to have a kingdom Oh hallelujah why are you fifth all ye little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm is that right but I said that demons was in those that storm hallelujah he looked beyond the circumstance and he saw what was causing it and he went straight for the juggler peace be still but the men Marvel saying what manner of man is this but they didn't understand when he opened that see in the waves obeyed him he was not speaking like a man he was speaking like God it wasn't the man who calmed the scene it wasn't a man who stopped that the waves it was God hallelujah hallelujah hey this is hey what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey Him they would steal carnal they would steal connell because all they could see was a man hallelujah and that's what's wrong with a lot of people now that's all they can see is a man and look at the proper guardians all i can see is a man he he didn't never he never cast out one devil it was Christ in him you never can't start a devil it was Christ you know the Empire can I say like this strike back never seen the movie but still yet and you and I must realize that's where God is trying to get us to it ain't a great number it's not a great number it's a small group of people everywhere a small group everybody is afraid feel for like Israel when it came to Goliath is that right everybody's afraid come on somebody if you are you afraid yeah don't do that my point is when God comes down hallelujah in the believer you become a David that David separates himself from everything all unbelief hallelujah and when they come to Capernaum they that receive tribute money coming to Peter see you gotta come you gotta become in control not outta control are we gonna perish no so when it come to the true believer he men they don't sad they don't fear it doesn't mean that fear doesn't come it doesn't mean that Fred will try to anoint you but the Holy Ghost which is perfect love will casts out that fear it is a Wars always a war but we are Empire I'm a messianic we gotta prove we're not from Satan's either hallelujah yeah all right all right yes I don't mind the amendment don't preach for me amen they that received tribute money came to Peter and said duck not your master paid tribute he said yes and when he was coming to the house Jesus prevented him saying what think is Dow Simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute or their own children or strangers you know III hope brother Keith don't mind me saying this but you know they're things that in his life and and sometime financial needs and you know God always meet those needs supernaturally not only in his life in my life two times a minute I don't know where it's coming from I don't know how it's gonna happen and God moves on the scene hallelujah who is that for God himself when you don't worry about it and you cast your cares upon him God will make sure it come to pass Oh hallelujah where the God you can't worry well I'm gonna make the rapture put your hands in the hands of the man who could steal the water hallelujah put your hands in the man who can calm the sea hallelujah is that Alright and when he had coming to the house Jesus prevented him saying what think about Simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute or their own children ought to have stranger Peter said to him or of strangers jesus said unto him then are the children free notwithstanding less ye you should offend them go down to the sea cast an hook take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou has open its mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and given the deal for me and thee now you gotta realize hallelujah only somebody who's got faith can do that right go down there and catch a fish do you realize how many fish there is and are in the sea and you say the first one comes up now you narrow it down what is the percentage of that ever happening hallelujah but Jesus had the first fish is that gonna only just help your money but gonna have mine too hallelujah and that's the way God bless - when you touch him he'll not only give you what you need and he'll also give you enough to bless someone else who you gotta take control you know I look at this thing and say Oh Lord I'm so sick of this devil you know and the thing about it people he only gets you in your mind if you let down that's what about the girdle of the mind if you let down if you take off the girdle you'll be like a city without walls he'll come right on in there hallelujah you know how you garden up your mind through prayer prayers you don't have to feel it hallelujah come talk to me oh I don't feel it I feel him but you gotta realize it you don't have to feel God to know that God is working God works because of his word not because of your feelings oh I feel like I got a blessing I don't have to feel nothing the Bible said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask whatsoever you will and it shall be given to you hey somebody help me here we're an empire and the trouble is it meant we don't help one another enough it's the truth you know when I struggled all or battled that spirit of cancer thought of cancer or whatever you know I was afraid to tell everybody because everybody don't think the way you do some people don't like you it's the truth and you know what they said well you know he just reaping what he sowed I've heard that kind of thing but then when they get sicker they reaping where they sold right you know it's the devil fighting them but that's the way people ah they become all jobs friends you know we'll say at the time you think you're going to get in cars but they gonna discredit you and everywhere in every way but when you know that you in the will of God think about it if Joe had only seen when God said have you considered him it would have change into a story but Joe still not knowing hold to his intensity because God trusted him and you and I we must trust him hallelujah you know why I'm so happy tonight because when God revealed to me that had to forgive all of my household I had to forgive I have I am oh I'm feeling so super tonight because there's not one burden not one billing is not nothing in my heart because I gave it over to the Lord and he's working it out hallelujah somebody help me here you gotta realize the greatest enemies outside of yourself is in your house among your family they're the ones that caused the heart but when you can say Father forgive them they know not what they do God says now that's the way I want you to behave hallelujah not an eye for an eye a tooth for tooth and vengeance is mine no Shaw vineyards is mine saith the Lord whoo somebody help me here see if the church could realize amen we supposed to work together we are mighty army hallelujah we supposed to keep in line we supposed to keep in step hallelujah not look to the left nor the right just right there onward Christian soldiers marching as to war hallelujah and who are we fighting hallelujah we're tearing down Satan's Kingdom hallelujah is that right the Bible said God put that devil under his foot yay we're more than triumphant is that right Paul said we're more than conquerors God will do what caused you to try on it seems like the battles getting hard seem like you don't know which way to turn but think about it the Bible said with every temptation God has always made away we take her linearly or sometimes we feel like Moses backed up against we see all these things coming at us don't scream don't cry speak the word and go for hallelujah he's made us kings and priests so if there's a king we must have a kingdom hallelujah and priests they were there too what forgive sin to do the sacrifice hallelujah and therefore will with kings and we're priests that means over our own Kingdom you say well who was Joe Joe was the king of this kingdom he made sacrifices for his children even when his children wasn't living right up the sacrifice was right hallelujah it's not by power not by might but by my spirit said the Lord is all about you believe in who you are he said that's what we are he said amen to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever is that right listen he said we will rule on the earth not just in the Millenium because we rule here we rule this you must prove you are king is that right supreme power in governing you got it you got to stay connected first of all he said that that that life will energize you the Holy Ghost come to energize you every day get energized is that right we don't let our causes run out of gas we know that if I call run out of gas it's going to stop so is it with you if you let your body your vessel run out of the gas of the Holy Ghost it's going to stop hallelujah is that all right each age lived there he lived there age live there message we're not nothing different we're not gonna get by every age lived their message that's what the probably God says in evening messenger he says each age had its message and messenger God has seen to that even in the church we find out that each one had a messenger and each one lived their age and another one come in and that one went out and another one come in and on down to the seventh church age each scar each angel of the church each messenger and see we find out excuse me at the last church age over in Revelation 10 there's to be a trumpet sound and there were seven voices they were not permitted to write but it was seven on the backside of the book the seven seals were on the back side of the book and after the book is written then it's sealed back there with seven seals now no one know what they are but it said in the day of the seventh angel sounding forth his message that earthly angel now because this angel came down from heaven and this was was on earth an angel is a messenger a messenger to the aged and we notice now we know with all these things about that rainbow sign and all of those things but you see it didn't say well you know it didn't make just a trumpet sound there's a message those voices has something to say and all the Prophet God did was tie into loose ends from all the way from from Paul all the way up to the Pentecostal age and his very age and he brought the puzzle in the picture back together so that we can see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if the puzzle had been restored that means the body has been restored that means the power of the bodies restored that means our Holy Ghost is back in the body that means we must do the same watch the same thing with the same power the same gives the same everything everything hallelujah live voices God ain't interested he's got people dancing and shouting speaking in tongues and everything else everywhere hallelujah God God would rather you sit quiet and not say nothing and live it then this child every service and be hypocritical somebody help me here is that right that's the way guardian God came back to restore to us the light that Adam had and Adam was ruler that right the winds obeyed Adam everything obeyed Adam the trees obeyed Adam he was the master of his circumstances hallelujah when God raised up Moses what was he doing he was teaching Moses has to become the master of his circumstances God brought in opposition on moses without even telling him that he was going to do it Wow he wanted Moses who realized that the world he had was master the master of all circumstance when Janna's and Jambres came to outdo Moses guess what happened Moses serpents swallowed up James and Jambres every time I don't care was an intellectual giant this word will swallow with him up hallelujah Wow because if not Crete it's not some intellectual but it's by revelation when you have revealed and God has revealed himself to you you know he's gone that was a thing that kept Moses while he didn't run away he knew he met the pillar fire he knew him that God hallelujah and so all fear was taken from Moses little boy hey that's what he said oh we need in terms of your thousands of live voices the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled eyes walking around in the earth today without a blemish well yes sure real Christians that's thunders against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but that hurts the devil but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life that right consecrated to God saying anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he can be and moves right on that throws him away see that thunders that that shakes the devil hallelujah you see what I'm saying a real Christian I'm sorry I'm I'm spitting everywhere because I had coffee before coffee drives you out but nevertheless it was good but nevertheless you and I must realize by God's grace we have alive and this message is bringing us into that life hallelujah we would have never learned and knew what we know now had it not been for the seventh angel messenger hello the probably God couldn't be he couldn't be nothing else his purpose was he born a prophet his purpose was had to be it he couldn't run away from it he didn't have the visions to show up they showed up well he liked it or not hallelujah he was called to that hallelujah that's why you can't help but to be this bride you can't help but to believe this message hallelujah it is your purpose for which God has made you you can't get away from it if you wanted to Oh God knows I don't want to woo is this okay you got to keep these things in mind Paul says listen Antichrist is going to come into this place he said they are already here John said they were gonna come john said they're already here and what was they doing they were disguising themselves as angels of light I mean if you look at the Corinthian church you can actually see the Antichrist moving everybody wanted to speak in tongues everybody want to prophesy everybody wanted to do something want that recognition and the devil always won't recognition hmm the devil almost we always want to be recognized for doing something hallelujah but not Jesus Jesus they don't tell nobody amen he don't want the recognition hallelujah remember that's the way the Christ is but when it comes to people and you won't recognize where he should he should have polluted me I should have been a bishop but that's how it is in that denomination or I'm quitting the church to see because I've been a preacher for a long time I've been held it for years and they won't promote me to be a bishop polos thing a man didn't know he was a bishop all along hallelujah glory to God now let me move on god don't care you know people don't want recognition is that right the brass is Lord when did we visit the sick when do we feed the poor when we win win win win win we don't know when see they were so busy about their father's business they didn't want no red didn't need the high class names hallelujah the only one I want to get recognition from is Jesus Christ my lord hallelujah Paul says listen I'm gonna die free second Peter first you know how it talks about the virtues but I'm gonna skip some of it because I'm just going quickly for if these things being you talk about the virtues here you know that's the divine nature of God and people don't want they don't to preach there you know what like I said they believe in healings they believe in deliverances is that right they believe in miracles hallelujah but the bride of Jesus Christ these people who claim to be bride have a hard time believing that God can transform them and that's the thing he came to do oh you believe in all the miracles well transformation of you you the greatest miracle that could ever happen why don't we start with it oh I used to be this and up in this for a long time that's all right God comes to change it and I know a man who could turn on the light is that right God can quicken your mind and make you know you do not have to remain in prison hallelujah is that right because he who said to say he who said he was said to free makes you free indeed he whom the Sun set free he's free huh your freedom has been purchased you can go free let's see you got a withered long eyeball with this we'll go dog didn't care jesus healed a lot of withered arms all my leg was shot but I wanted to go home God don't care you was born with it and headed 30 years but doesn't mean that doesn't mean you have to continually have it the man for 30 years blind never seen daylight before bar that way he could have made an excuse I was born as man there's no way out not when it comes to Jesus not when it comes to his empire hallelujah we come to straighten and see everything say to me crooked we come to straighten it out that's the power of the Holy Ghost come on somebody you gotta believe it that God that the problem is with us we don't have enough love and compassion Jesus was always moved with love and compassion that's why people were being able to be healed and delivered it was he saw condition and it moved him but we look at conditions as oh lord have mercy hallelujah you are the mercy you are the mercy God put you there because you're the mercy but we use it like like a some second handed thing when we are the Christ we are the Messiah's oh you're getting you getting scared on me now see but that's what we are but as long as your line is not girdled and you just scattered plain you'll never come to see what God has called you to do oh lord help us but if you like these things is blind and this is what I'm telling you tell you folks I can't explain what I'm telling you all I know it's been a greater revelation and every day it seems to get greater and greater and then when the Lord comes to show you you can't have one of these things to you then what you do you ask for them you ask for them because when you ask you show him you believe that you're supposed to have it hallelujah and you know what I keep telling the sauce every day almost I said Lord I'm coming I'm coming Lord I'm coming hallelujah whoa what you're saying I feel the pool I feel the pull of God whoo but he's at like at these things it's blinding can I see afar off and have forgotten know that he was purged from his sins wherefore the rather umbrella give diligent to make your call in an election shul you better hallelujah time is running out you better do it stop being the way all come on somebody every one of us he says and such were some of you that means all of us when we came to Christ had to be sanctified cleansed up huh hallelujah old friend of mine he was a young man he said it was hard for him to get saved because he was born in the message and he had never done much wrong so when they were calling for sinners he didn't see himself as a sinner he couldn't go up because he never been out in the world he never did this he never did daddy never did it it just didn't have the revelation though that he was born he was born a sinner and every day he in his life he sin one of the things that made him a sinner because he didn't believe he was you know it don't care I mean somebody's priest and everything else could outdo us hallelujah but yet they were Devils the Bible said have you thirst and hunger after righteousness you shall be filled that's what makes you different your thirst is different hallelujah your thirst is different if you first every day more righteous Laura holy moly it proves who you are and then you can us from their shoddy ha ha and he's there to feed you every day for so an interest share being ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ wherefore will not be negligence to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth yay I think it meat as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting yourself in room in other words as long as I'm here I will keep preaching this to you but I want you to remember remember what I'm just preaching here and he says listen in the day that brother Brooks is gonna be here I want him to remember stir him up that these things must be in you because this is the divine nature of God this is what animal loves hallelujah and because of Jesus because of Jesus Christ dying and raising from the dead oh we didn't realize amen when that Holy Ghost came on a day of Pentecost we oh come on how is that facade we thought I was speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing and feeling good hallelujah but that was it was more to it than that God was restoring his nature back to mankind building his empire hallelujah and God is building his empire and reestablishing his nature God's nature in man and if his nature is being reestablished in you it makes you him you become him and he become you that's what Jesus said father I pray that we become one they become one even as we are one when did they become one when the Holy Ghost came down on that River and Jesus and God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in hallelujah not okay give me a few more minutes we're talking about resurrection I can't get over that either cuz I'm harder you know Bible said we're already sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus alright at 8:30 give me a few more minutes he said Amen in first Corinthians 15 42 and 49 is it so also is the resurrection of the Dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power what that's right this means this man so what by sex hallelujah but poor and bereaved hallelujah it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body there's a spiritual body and so it is written listen you got to understand God trying to get us to be somewhere we're talking about the squeeze hallelujah but God took a man 2000 years ago by the name of Philip and translated him translated him he didn't have a bus ticket he didn't have a car he didn't have a plane God took him and moved him into the desert hallelujah I'm talking about in the after age and he declared I am the Alpha and the Omega maybe I'm crazy but that's what I believe hallelujah I believe if I don't have transportation God can make it happen when it come to his purpose and his working we kept that believe he's the same he done he's the same yesterday today forever hallelujah ah he said the first man was made a living soul the last Adam was uh first man Adam excuse me was made a living soul the second the last Adam was made a quick Experion that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthly the second man is of the Lord from heaven the first man Adam was my daddy he was from the earth but my this the last one that second one that one that we know is a quickening spirit the box that he is Lord mm-hmm from heaven as is the earthly such as they also that are earthly and as is the heavenly such are they also the heavenly did we bear the image of Adam we are called the sons of Adam we got ears like him a nose like him eyes like him enough lock him talk like him walk like him we bared that natural image and as we have been born of the image of the earthly we shall not that we might not that it might happen it shall in the eyes of God is already done hallelujah he said we shall also bear the image of the heavenly what a promise what a promise I didn't even want to look like my daddy until my DNA says it ain't what you want it happened as long as that we eat is longer that would continue to be healthy my brother when I talk to him here the last time he says tell me at what point in time and you know in your years did you realize you changed from looking like your mama to your daddy I said I did notice I said if you go back in some of my pictures I look like a different fellow altogether nevertheless I bear the image of my natural father was that by chance no sir it's programmed hallelujah I'm almost done see we come to take control this is your land and remember I told you this is your inheritance hallelujah after it's all said and done this earth will be ours we come back here and wherever else he wants us to go hallelujah I'm almost done I'm gonna do this last quote coming from the fundamental faith foundation of faith he says now the things of it is since he has restored man back to this place man in the fallen has lost his conscious of what father put him here on earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brain and our outlets the faith has been clogged up with business affairs with the home life domestic things it's all become so clogged clogged up with that until God can't operate through those channels that he made a man fall now when God made a human body every little part of it had its place to play the teeth the tongue the eye the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make the man to live if God so pad and the man the body of a man how much more as we patterned and said in order the body of Christ the church if God designed man's body he certainly designs the body of his son the church and he's designed us to come together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have these supernatural workings of God outlets through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy wisdom and knowledge and the gifts of healing and all of these other different gifts is outlets that God lets out his power and let out his revelation to the people in other words you and I have no right to get jealous of anybody who's got something that we don't have just use what you've got everybody has something different oh I felt like shopping but I had to hold this pulpit right see God the design men's body not as an individual so much but as units we're all together one great body of believers and now how do we get into this body by mystical body of the Lord Jesus by one spirit we're all baptized into this body now Satan but the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death brought operates to Satan's sins right did you hear what I said let me read that again and if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more God with his power make his laws work in man if Satan can make his laws be sure and us in laws be sure and us recognize it how much more God to his children to make his laws be recognized among his people of divine healing revelation power gifts manifestation of the Spirit the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things you tell you that whatever Satan put on you the law of Liberty has come to make you free oh mercy my last one can I do it faith doesn't come by fasting faith doesn't come by praying reading a book all of that's good fasting praying reading reading a book but faith come by a settled something that's in the human heart that tells you just as you as you come to this church tonight when you come home you told your wife you'll be home after the service was over you do that unconsciously you just go out and get in your car and go on home now you come could not do it unless you have faith you could do it you never move from there you're sitting if you didn't have faith you could raise up but you've done it so much and you just become so accustomed to those laws till it's a natural thing now y'all got to understand when we were babies we had to believe we could walk we had to believe we could crawl because that was the thing that initiated us it it was the thing that made us we looked at our siblings or whoever we saw them walking and said well I can do that but see it became so common we just do it now if we could throw ourselves completely to God and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ being us them same operation of the Spirit will work through us just as the natural things does naturally supernatural right just the same thing because we were first created for the purpose to control to rule and to praise God and to live for God we what let me read that again we were the purpose we were created for that purpose to control to rule and to praise God and live for God and Jesus said if your body tell the devil I was created for this purpose and to rule you you're minding don't get this it's got to be your heart if you abide in me and my word about in you you can ask what you will and it shall be given unto you if you abide in me and my word abiding you huh that means is living to abide to abode it lives there and the Father and his word is inseparable because the word is his son and in the beginning was aware of the words with God in the Word was God and the world was made flesh and dwelt among us God and His Word is inseparable you cannot have God without having his word and when you have his word you have God oh so I'll leave it everything the human race lost in Adam was redeemed when try God himself become kinfolk with the human race and redeemed it back to his maker all that was lost he redeemed back again what a marvelous picture you see it's our origin it's what we supposed to be right and if we don't learn to use it says you know we teach a baby how to talk we teach the baby how to walk and once that baby learned how to talk and the walk it gets on his own right and God Holy Spirit is teaching us how to be messiahs little God's anointed one and the the teaching is you must repeat the words that daddy is speaking you said you know that we race between the when the baby start talking says the mom says say mama mama and and the dad say say Dada Dada Dada because we want that baby first word to be daddy right normally that's what it is about I'm sorry sisters that's just the way it goes they hardly ever say mama and they're down the road but daddy is a easier way to pronounce things because they're the way their mouths of things but nevertheless they learn how to say words properly because we rehearse those words to that child Jesus rehearses his word and he says now this is the way it's supposed to be said hello and if you say it the way it is written and the way it's supposed to be said you'll get the same product you become gods when you learn how to speak like gods let's stay we're an empire we're the kingdom and every Kingdom that works for his king every King works for his kingdom you want to make sure everything in his kingdom is right things going right you know no foolishness you know he wants it right and that's the way the Holy Ghost is I think a lot of time we fail to see that the Holy Ghost is reporting every little action indeed that we do we we forget because we can't see him we think he's not dead but God was here before we came he will always be here and he sees us he knows I every move he knows I ever every thought there's no way out of this thing other than to do what he wants us to do God is not forcing us to serve Him he said whosoever will let him come God wants willing House willing minds who don't want to go listen my thing is I don't care if he's black like the probably God said I don't care if he's black brown white don't make no difference I don't care what kind of eyes his color of eyes color of his hair when I see it I'm not falling in love with his physical I'm falling in love with his spirit with that supernatural being that went out I can't say it like that when I was way but because he didn't but he agreed to suffer to die for us think about it people father not my will but thine be done he had to make a choice as a man to suffer because he realized the greater the greater in what is going to be like for those who are redeemed those who press their way through this age and be those little messiahs that he wants them to be right it's beyond Christian everybody to say they're Christians but God want to see Christ he want to see a life live life thundered where she shaped the atmosphere once you walk into a room see that kind of a shaking the more the more that I surrender the law the more that are released like
