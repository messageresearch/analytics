TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we've been we started last week we're not going to sing We started last week on um a little thought dealing with wisdom versus faith and uh you know we we showed in our text or in our thought that we have no no no place for reasoning now one of the quotes that I never did get to but I'm going read it just so you'll know where we're we're going with this and that was in the message wisdom vers versus Faith he said if wisdom is with the word and proves to be with the word and the word produces Itself by the same thing then it is the word but if wisdom is against the word and not with the word but trying to find something to add to it or take from it it is of the devil amen okay and the Holy Ghost seed of the Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom or that kind of wisdom so amen so if we can look at ourselves this morning we can get a better understanding of our spirit spiritual condition and what is happening with us perhaps somewhere down the road you may have uh uh uh uh how could I say it um use your own reasoning for things and I myself have been guilty remember I told you that amen and remember I told you by the grace of God Amen that I've been repenting ever since hello somebody when you find yourself wrong you say Lord I'm guilty forgive me amen amen because remember our age and and it's not some of us all of us had to come to a place to say Lord forgive me I was wrong Lord I didn't understand it Lord you know that's the way it really is amen because if it wasn't so according to Revelation the Bible tells us in Revelations 3 amen be zelers to repent and it goes on to say I chasen Those whom I love I rebuke Those whom I love so when a when a when God chasing you and rebuke you in this age you can receive it you can hear it it is a it is surely you know God loves you amen how many people in this world would love to know this truth and they have no idea that it even exists when Jesus was on the earth only a few people came to know that God was In the Flesh on Earth amen and those few people amen that was there didn't even receive him he said I came into my own my own received me not but he said I gave power to them that believe so that they could become the sons of God is that right let's stand we're going to read 2 Corinthians 4:6 6 and we're going to read Revelations 10 let's read Revelations 10 first okay Revelations 10 it's a great it's a good atmosphere in here but let's take it higher amen amen hallelujah Revelations 10 beginning at the first verse and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and with a rainbow upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillar pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book opened and he sat his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which are the seven Thunders uh excuse me which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand into heaven and swear by that living swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the Earth that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen amen second Corinthians please second Corinthians we're going to start at the uh six uh fourth chapter uh beginning at the sixth verse fourth chapter beginning at the sixth verse let's read at the third third I'm sorry but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness have shined in our hearts to give the lights of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be M be of God and not of us hello all right let's just stop right there but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us amen you love the Lord amen let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace we we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love and father we feel your presence here this morning we pray father that you break and destroy the yolks of the enemy I pray father that you would just work a work into your people's hearts I pray father that you just have preeminence Lord forgive us of any sin any thought any desire oh God that we may have had that perhaps it's contrary to your word we pray father God Lord that you would just uh move in this place on the altar of the people's hearts Lord to your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated Hallelujah that's another thing when I'm up here praying I want all of you to pray hello come on somebody you're not here to listen to me pray you here to help pray you all all right this morning amen I I'm super you guys I'm feeling real good this morning maybe that's the problem I'm up here and y'all down here but y'all got to come up here for those of you come on now amen so we realize I want to I want to kind of something dropped in my heart here this morning and and and you know and I don't want you to misunderstand it but you see for a long time men never did see God God had no face right it was only in this time in our day God Reveals His face because even in Jesus day they said he was be asab huh most of them didn't even understand that that was God in human flesh am now I think I know where you think I'm going but just hold your horses because really you've got got to understand that God is creating Us in His image and his likeness right he's moving us into a position that we look just like him amen now I want you to understand amen God is a spirit and I'm not talking about the animal part amen but he's working with the spirit of God because God is a spirit amen but in this last day God put on a face amen oh my let's move on because here in the scripture tells us but if our gospel be hi it is here to them that are lost in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not see what the reason they were blinded because they believed not and God said that he would give you a strong delusion if you believe not so that you would believe a lie and be condemned by it right amen lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them Lord show us the father that he suffices us have I been so long time with you amen and you don't know me Jesus said when you see me you see the father amen right because really amen if you look at him you think well he was just talking about his physical being but he was talking about the expression of God the the working of God because he said I can't do nothing except the father show me amen hello somebody amen but it was his character it was his life it was all that was in him because Christ the word says in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily now you got to recognize this brother brandham said it like this he said when when when that Angels those three angels went down to Sodom or even met Abraham he said that was Elohim the self-existing one hello but it was God who stepped into dust 16 elements and Abraham was able to recognize it Hallelujah come on somebody why because first of all he calls him Abraham and Abraham understood that only person who knew his change of name was God himself so he calls him Abraham and Abraham see God now manifested In the Flesh and he didn't call him Lords he called him Lord showing had the true revelation of the word amen now we fail to see and I let me say like this according to the book of Acts the book of Acts say we are are The Offspring of God we're not the spring We're The Offspring come on somebody We Are The Offspring in other words we were with him amen when he said let there be amen amen it's important that you know this because really I want you to understand you have been predestinated to do what you do amen you better hold on to that one amen anden because we're living in a Time amen which which the prophet of God said it is the most deceitful of all ages is that all right he said it is the most deceitful you know and I heard him say something the other day he said this age is the age where Satan legalizes sin think about it he legalizes sin everything that's contrary to the word he legalizes it and everybody that stands for other word you look illegal amen right amen but he he legalizes this thing so that you you're the one you look like you're the misfit you're out of order but in reality you are the word amen now I don't know about you even if I like I tell people like this I say if I am the weakest of all Christians Under the Umbrella of this message I'll still will never deny it amen if I am one that cannot live it to its fullest potential I will still never deny it amen this evil age is when he's doing the very uh very a it is a very age of deception that's why I I wanted to bring this because you and I we're putting we're being placed in a position where we've got to believe every word every word now whether you understand it or not he said he didn't ask you to understand it he asked you to believe it amen see and when you believe every word of God Amen it puts you in a position to be bride amen I'll be doing a lot of quoting out of the message of of God of this Eva age turn with me to Matthew 24 please ain't God good Matthew 24 beginning at the fourth verse now Jesus began to tell us how bad this age was going to be and how it was going to uh uh continue on until basically the coming of the Lord here Amen in the fourth verse of this chapter uh 24 Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you now he's absolutely warning you that there will come those who will and have the ability to deceive but he said take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my my name say I am Christ and shall deceive many now watch this because you and I will look at the organizations and the denominations but I want you to understand these deceivers are among the ranking of what we call the message and you should hear wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for Nations shall rise against Nations kingdoms against kingdoms and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes and diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows meaning it ain't over yet see and that's what we don't understand I think a lot of us don't understand it's going to get worse what we just saw over there in the Philippines I'm a hurricane or typhoon however you want to call it amen strikes to land at 195 M an hour some place is 200 and something you and I can't even fathom that's like getting hit by a truck or a car going by that speed because I want you to understand a wall of wind is a wall of wind and it literally ravished the country and we have no idea still how bad it really is yesterday I think they said over a thousand people they were expecting 10,000 to be you see but listen what they don't understand is what's getting ready to happen here Millions upon Millions will die you know why because this church lost its Savor the church lost the salt the church lost the influence remember I preached the other day amen no Nation or country is really judged until the church dies until the church gets out of order amen come on somebody right when you and I get out of order because judgment first began at the house of God and this nation this city called Iowa can be blessed and the power of God God can move among this place if we get in order amen like I said I don't care where I go it's blessed amen when I go to the grocery store sometimes I go to the grocery store nobody is in there and then when I come in there everybody come it's because God blesses us wherever you trod your feet amen wherever you place your feet amen it's blessed hello somebody so we're living in a Time amen where you really come on somebody now it started even in Ezekiel it started he said began at the ancient began at the house of God and because the house of God was out of order the whole city was judged right when Jesus came to to Jerusalem he didn't go to the to the to the the prime minister or the or the you know the the pharaoh or whatever you call him he went to the house of God Amen and because the house of God failed the whole Jerusalem fa amen see you said well what do you mean how many storms this little the church by way of prayer calls to dissipate or to move around and the the news people say well we don't know what happened we want a church and we prayed that God would stop the storm and he did amen Stone upon Stone now we look at this thing because amen we're living and you don't know how dangerous it is to be C become cold starchy and formal amen y'all think oh we didn't you know we it was all right the church is you know the service but to become cold starchy and formal shows that there's something wrong in you somewhere somewhere Satan has duped you if you come to church and you have no fire to offer hello somebody somewhere you've been deceived amen amen somewhere because listen if you come to church and you don't have no joy oh Lord somewhere you've been deceived Satan is on your track come on somebody and he comes to steal kill and destroy now let me back it up here a little bit let me let me go on he says now just a cold former sty church and so forth of manmade theology he said that wouldn't that wouldn't see the elect would never pay no attention to that but it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving out one word is all you have to do Christians everywhere take heed to the hour we're living in mark down and read and listen close what God called what what would God call a people out of this age for his name the reason it is is to try her oh I don't want to be tried I don't want to go through but you've been called amen for God to try you AMU to see whether you would stand on the word or repe Hallelujah and when she is made manifest been tried and is proven and what he goes on to say to prove to Satan that you're not like e Hallelujah to prove to her to prove to Satan you're not like Eve I'm not going to reason with it I'm going to take him at his word now here we are because I want you to understand I read last week on Wednesday when we started you don't have a thought coming yes you know that's where Eve messed up she thought she could reason she started outright but she allowed the enemy to continue to woo her to in her mind she thought well maybe he is no maybe God had already said what he's going to say Amen right and you and I came along and now you say what what what if it ain't no private interpretation brother keth know what it is and I we've gone down to we used to go down to this big I'm G call his name Hope Church and you know everybody you get in Bible study and and everybody trying to figure out what he said every man want to give that comment on what he said the Bible done already said it John go close the door did he mean go close the door yes sir see that's how silly it sounds right but in the message amen when we come amen when we come Amen to this message we come amen wisdom versus Faith amen Earthly wisdom versus God's faith which is a revelation of the word you don't have to reason with it brother brand said it is the prophet of that age that interprets the wordu he interprets the word all we got to do is preach it amen see it's the truth people we come to a place am man I've been guilty I've been guilty but I'm repenting of all that I've ever said or done amen that haven't been completely right on the word you say well what do you mean because understand God had to allow all of us to go through seven Church ages personally but in that seven Church age personally you've been broken down beaten down stolen pmer worm cankerworm Locust caterpillar done ate from you and now God got to restore you amen hello God restores you as an individual so therefore as he's restoring that means you're growing you're understanding all of your errors and in the process of God you are repenting that's why the mighty Angel come down he didn't send an Aron boy he came down himself am and the Bible like he like Joshua did he came and he possessed the land and the Sea everything that belongs in the everything of the land everything the of the sea that is mine is mine he possessed politics he possessed everything he possessed the whole world he possess possess you he possessed me he possessed everything and he says time will be no more and he takes the book that gives him the right to everything and he said take this book amen and I want you to eat it am come on somebody I want you to know that this is your inheritance I I want you to know that I'm making you a possessor of Heaven and Earth I have paid the price and so therefore I want you to be a POS possessor of Heaven and Earth but he listen said now the time is short so I need you to be zealous to repent hello somebody he goes on to say we find out how this age is to be is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve and that she is not that type of a woman and she would be Tried by his word the bride as Adam bride was tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise and that he's the same yesterday today and forever he come on somebody but failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that call for his name of course is his bride she is come in in contact again with the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but uh every word see that's where you are where you and I are we are now in a position if we're going to take a rapture we got to say every word Lord am every word right oh I don't believe this there's a lot of things I don't understand but I believe it amen for the beginning of the Bible man was given the word of God to live by one word misinterpreted by man called Satan in a person of an animal called The Serpent and Satan in this person could take talk to Eve and misinterpret the word to her and was lost see it must be every word in the middle of the Bible Jesus come and said man should not live by bread alone but by every word when he was tempted by Satan now God telling us here the last day that the God of this world will rise up in the last days and whatsoever shall add whosoever shall add one word to it or take one word from it his part will be taken from the book of life amen listen people here what's being sad now I'm putting that in there that listen people hear what's being that's mean God be merciful unto us let us not walk as stiff shirs chest struck out head up know it all for we too we for we too one time were in Disobedience let us with grace and mercy and feelings in our heart toward God humbly come to the throne of grace strange now after some 1900 years of God preaching now she that is the world system is more evil than in the days of when when that he was here the world system is more evil the world is headed to a great climax he said you know that Revelation 18 please headed to a great climax how many of y'all believe that amen I'm looking at this thing and I tell you what I'm I'm actually uh shaking in my shoes I can't even explain it all I know is that I've been ordained to make a Rapture Hallelujah come on somebody and those of you who are ordained to make a Rapture Amen Let Us repent drop everything this is our year to go free hallelujah hallelujah and after these things I saw saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the whole of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird now if there are people trapped in those systems God just described them I don't care what they look like from the outside is what's on the inside that God see for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her delices and I heard another voice from Heaven say come out of her my people that she be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues amen for her sins have reached into heaven and God has remembered her iniquities hello reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she have filled uh filled fill to to her double for how much she have glorified herself liveed deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she sath in her heart I sit as a queen and am no Widow and she and shall see no sorrow now listen hhhh you and I must understand that Babylon is not a place Babylon is a condition hello somebody it's a condition cuz it's all over the world now she is everywhere and Babylon the word means confusion Lord amen hallelujah come on somebody confusion and when ever there is confusion the Bible said every evil work is present amen no you look at this thing and you say well well brother what do you mean I don't came out of her well there let me say like this Israel came out of Egypt but Egypt was still in Israel hello Israel came out of Egypt but Egypt was still in Israel right they didn't know it but it proved themselves because every time the word came forth they had an argument they had something to dispute with come on somebody oh Moses this and Moses that and Moses you don't know what you're talking about haven't you haven't you heard it you know brother Brandon made a mistake here hey you better be careful if he did you better keep your mouth shut oh y'all got quiet on that I think I need to say that again because listen if you're not a prophet how do you know he made a mistake it is you mean to tell me God don't know how to tell talk you mean if God speaks a word wrote the word put it in heaven put it in the pyramid and then you going to tell him he don't know what he's talking about as a man we understand I'm talking about the word word now I'm talking about the word see because we we you know we understand as a man brother brandham you know that he had he was a man there was only one perfect man and that was Jesus Christ himself he says that brother BR says on one one occasion he says listen he said Jesus Christ is the original and he said how do you he said I am oh God I forgot that word I it'll come back to me but you and I must understand he says I am a perversion he used the word as a per he said I am a perversion amen I was born of a woman amen I was born in sin amen hallelujah but the God that was in that perversion Hallelujah the God that was in that that that Badger skin was the almighty God hallelujah God just brought him here so he can show y'all what he can do in you amen Ela didn't come here to to show off eler went looking for a bride amen look at up brother Brown said I am a perversion Jesus Christ is the original but you don't hear people preaching that but it's in there go check it out it's true but listen let's move on by the grace of God he goes on to say listen you and I we we don't have we we look at this Mighty Angel and we see God coming down and we see God says come out of her in other words don't look back and say oh let me say it like this this is why when these people came and try they tried to tell me uh the cloud wasn't this and the cloud wasn't that and all kind of stuff and and I said well you know if you got something better I look into it you got something greater show me what it is well what preacher you know excuse me amen got a fire give me another preacher with the Billy Graham didn't have it or robers didn't have it none of them had it Hallelujah but this one is Vindicated come on somebody amen you see because I realize there's so many people they want to worship him as uh you and I must understand that when brother bam said he said we are a rotation off of God in other words God didn't go to a c a a different substance in other words the the fire that brother brandham had you and I got it but his me measure of fire was more than what we got because God brought him he was a prophet of the age but we got the same fire it's not a different fire but brother brandham said it like this and I got to quote he said you got to know that you got it he said if Satan can keep you from knowing that you have it he said you won't do nothing with iten and that's the problem with a lot of Believers you got something something but you don't know you got it and when you don't know you've got it amen you don't do nothing with it and God is saying examine yourself to see whether you be in the faith Hallelujah there ain't no turning back amen I love the way the prophet of God give this illustration he talking about the fire the building that was on fire he said that old amateur that old amateur fire say spray a little here squirt a little bit here squ he said that old one that had that experience he said he as the fire truck come to a halt the ladder amen the ladder coming down the the captain on top he says come on boys amen he was the first in line he was the first that led in there when you know what you got Hallelujah you're not in the background you on the front line is that all right Hallelujah glory to God Amen listen the Bible said he having great power and the Earth was lightened with it Glory now when that prophet of God stood on or and I'm not I'm bringing this to you so you can understand so that you can understand that this message is correct and if it's wrong anywhere any place we better look for another Malachi for amen if one word was wrong got Eve and us into this trouble come on all must be right Amen in order to to restore us and if we're not restored we better look for the one that's coming to restore us oh Lord am I making sense amen hallelujah come on somebody this is nothing time is nothing amen we're working with eternity amen I think about I I know y'all this might sound strange but I think about those Souls that are lost and on Earth they had no patience for nothing but there they don't have nothing but time hello you know things like that's what something something gets to me I don't like the thought of somebody dying without Jesus it disturbs me it really disturbs me because I'm thinking Lord were they ever told do they know the word do do they know him because it's not everl it's not Eternal but I'm going tell you what when you've been there in a moment's time that moment's time seems like eternity y'all know what I'm talking about have you ever been in a situation and it seemed like it was forever and it was just for a few minutes right can you IM you can't imagine it you can't imagine it but listen let's move on listen God ain't judging you according to your flesh look what the prophet of God said in God of this evil he said God will judge you by what kind of a spirit you got in you not judge you by your body amen but by your spirit amen that inner man God of that's what he said God going to judge you because of what you got in you what's in the bottle brother Brooks the Holy Ghost he said you are you got you you got treasure in this Earthly vessels Halle it may like beat up on the outside but it's God on the inside huh remember the prophet God told that story about that old old old uh he looked like a little beggar he was a poor man and everything else he got hit by a car and everything else and you know they took him to the doctor the hospital and they said a he ain't worth nothing a ain't no use in US wasting our time and that old man woke he got up and he said listen I am worth something Jesus Christ died for my sin Hallelujah I don't care I might look beat up to you I may not have nothing Hallelujah but I'm worth a million world so are you amen ain't no use in coming this long journey and then give up quit or come short no sir this is a time to say Lord whatsoever be it unto me according to your word he said listen the outside man see taste feel smell hear he said but the inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will amen your free will devil made me do it your free will amen you can accept what the devil says or accept What God Says and that determine what Spirits in there if it's a spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything of the world Amen Jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world is because the love of God is not even entered this Inner Man time to say Lord forgive me Satan's deceived you that's the hardest thing people don't want to believe oh I've been a Christian all my life denominational people can say that too and yet we know they deceive right but you can find people in this message with all kinds of habits all kinds of wickedness in their spirits and their lives and you know what they still believe they going to make a Rapture and that might be true but God ain't taking you up until you're clean amen and the fire of God has come down in you to live in you no unclean thing were in there that's the word amen no whong no liar no Thief not even that one that have a spirit of fear yes you got to get rid of that spirit amen hallelujah I hope you've being blessed am men should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god notice we find that she is naked lewd and nude and the world seemed to be in the most evil age never in any age did women ever act like that never but just before the destruction of the antalan world woo he said just before the destruction and Jesus referred to it we get to that after a while has God lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control he said I wonder the true answer to this question is to my opinion there is two opposing spirits in the world today at work there can be no more than two two heads the one of them is the holy spirit at work and the other one is the spirit of the devil and in the last days in deception he said I'm going to base my thoughts right on here for the rest of the text he goes on and he tells us amen there's two Spirits now I want you to think this morning how much you've yielded to God how much have you yield to God not in just the last week this morning amen how much of you have obeyed God like we said go the devil ain't going to tell you to get on your knees and pray amen the devil will never tell you to fast unto the Lord come on somebody the devil never will tell you to forgive your brother to love him come on I want you to understand am man we are living in an influence your world and one or the other is influencing you right now amen faith is catching a hold of your heart or unbelief one of the two is working this morning faith is working or unbelief you're saying within your heart right now it's for me I can do it or The Devil Is Telling You woe is me Hallelujah come on somebody people are making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ he's doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ if the finger supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is to see it is in the in this age the eye will see the spirit of God as it grows into the full statue of God Amen that's what he says the spirit of God as it grows into the full statue of God where in you and me the spirit of God growing into the full statue of God where now listen do I understand full full full statue of God hallelujah every age got a piece every age got a part but we get a full amen y'all amen y'all understand that amen every age that means if if what they did with a part oh my God what we supposed to be doing with a fo Hallelujah think about it what the ages before us did in part compare it to what we supposed to do or what we should be doing with a full am matter of fact the Bible said they cannot be complete without us amen come on somebody now if it's not happening in our lives we need to seek God and find out where we need to repent amen where we need to surrender somewhere we're not surrendering to the Holy Spirit like we ought to amen sometime your good ain't good enough y'all understand what I mean he said the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the Holy Ghost a holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos amen the devil's Unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error as usual by perversion of the word of God like he did at the beginning see it coming right back to that se time again oh my goodness

just to see God changing changing and I'm loving every decision he's making for me Hallelujah come on somebody every decision Ephesians 2 let's begin at the first verse and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world let me put it this way he said in time pass now if you still walking that means you hadn't come to this place in time past walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience now he God have mercy he didn't say the spirit that worketh about them he said in them and you and I when we got saved we were full of devils before we got saved the spirit of dis in other words the devil was in you amen you may have had a seed of God gening you but the devil operated you before that was quickened oh it's amazing you know because some of y'all done forgot you weren't always saints come on somebody somebody come in here amen filthy and unclean and you know we look at them as if you've been saved all your life that's right have mercy on us because if you ever adopt an attitude like that you need to be saved among whom also we all had our conversation in time past I like that word all in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God what who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us oh people of God is only because God loved you you know the the the the Judgment of this thing that's so scary is because if any of us miss it which I hope no one will but if you do you know what the Judgment that's going to be so hard on you is that you heard it you heard the word preached amen and you made the decision whether you would receive it or not the world got their P portion they going to suffer but it's going to be far worse on the people who Under the Umbrella of this message you say oh ain't no way they going to miss it brother Bruce let me tell you something the Bible tell us brother B tells us about two million following Moses out of Egypt a hey about two

their clothes never toore up God always fed him showed them miracles signs and wonders it wasn't what was on the outside that God was looking at he was looking at what was on the inside because he said Joshua and Caleb had a new spirit a different one see God don't care how much you he working with the inside amen all the out hoop all the out stuff outside don't mean a thing to God if the inside is not made proper amen come on somebody is that all right fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin have quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved you know what wait a minute brother Brooks I've got an unconditional Covenant you know what brother brandom explained that it is unconditional that's right and he said I can do whatever I want to do I can sin as much as I want to he said but the thing is

God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God ha before ordained that we should walk in them God ordained it amen that's the only reason why you can do it not by power not by might but by my spirit say the Lord I'm trying my best to keep holding myself now you know I look at this thing because I want you to realize amen that this thing is so perfect amen that you know the Bible say the fool couldn't air in it that's what Isaiah said they're coming away and brother said ain't just the highway it's a way in the way it's the narrow way Hallelujah and a fool will not air amen simple one of the things that we teach children so simple the first thing we teach them is no it's so simple but it's powerful we don't have to say don't do that the first word we said no and the first thing that they learned is no they learn when they don't want to do something is no they learn when you don't want to do want them to do something is no just just simple and that's all God told e no don't eat of the tree that wasn't complicated but she reasoned with no and and it's true it's like what part of no you don't understand let's move on now we look at this thing I I can't explain the Revival that's happening in me I just know that it is and and there ought to be the Revival in you amen people say well how you know the Lord's coming cuz I I know it something on the inside you know I got a six sense I I got a six sense you know brother B talked about he said when no when India had that earthquake he said those birds knew to get away from the wall amen hallelujah come on they knew the earthquake was coming and if you don't know to get away from the walls something's wrong amen somewhere something's wrong amen listen no man can boast for we are the workmanship it is Christ let me read this quote here amen coming from God of this evil age and I love this I I had to read it over and over and over again again he said and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him there God made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection amen if I'm in him I'm already in the Resurrection come on somebody oh come on somebody I didn't pay for it why cuz he paid for me he rose me and raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil amen I'm going to say that again so y'all can believe it and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil amen oh if you could only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe and are afraid to move you'll never use it oh Lord so he said you can be seated there don't even believe you seated there see that's the devil's trick amen that's why I say emotions are good but you can't rest on them they will deceive you come on somebody that's what deceiving the world their emotions oh my God come on on somebody I have to it's the truth but if you if you see your emotions is deceiving you amen amen what makes murderers they feel like they're a murderer Satan make you feel like certain things that make you what you are Satan does God makes you what you are by the word hallelujah but if you are seated there you will use it for you ordained to do what you do I loved it because he said it look like God things are out of time out of SN he said everything is on time ain't nothing out of sink ain't nothing out of control everything is on time with God y'all hear what I'm saying he said Pharaoh on the other side was raised up for his purpose the Bible said to be Pharaoh Judah of sky was raised up to be the son of the predition now notice these great truths that we are approaching now we see that the church refused to accept God's word to rule over them and accept Barabas instead now if you want the scriptures on that Matthew 27:15 to 23 what did this do what position did this do not understand this and I I don't see how I'm almost done with this portion I have a hard time understanding how people in this message can believe that the Catholic church is the can believe that the Protestants churches are are the daughters of the

time oh come on somebody thank you Lord you think Elijah had the power to do what he did you think Moses had the power to do what he did it was Christ amen the whole time has always been Christ amen
