either I believe it praise the Lord God is good to us I'm just gonna get right into the word of the Lord I think that that that's a beautiful song I've always liked it I could remember the first time I heard it was that Jarrell Hughes's in South Carolina on Polk Street Amen a sister with the guitar sang that song and I've loved it ever since Amen Psalms 19 one through six thank you those of you who pray for us while my wife and I were on a trip it was also a mission God really blessed and gave me peace was what I needed to know surely I thank God for His grace I don't know how I'm going to minister this message I don't know how I just hope and trust it God give you understanding because to me it's it's really something I'm seeing and I'm it's been really unfolding I was talking to brother Craig yesterday and I said I don't even know how to bring this revelation out the thing that I'm looking at the thing that I'm seeing I really don't know how and I just trust that somehow God will quicken it to you amen tonight I'll be ministering on this tonight and Sunday as well so we just want to take our time by God's grace Psalms 19 I'm glad to see but I wasn't thinking he was gonna be here I'm surprised to hear that voice Psalms 19:1 through six they heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night short knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line is going out through all the earth and their works words their words to the end of the world in them have he set a tabernacle for the Sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing here from the heat there let us pray father God we come before you as humbly as we know how and we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us then we have been to ourselves Lord there is no way to explain you even though we have the word your word here we can take the scripture from Scripture and line upon line and precept upon precept but Lord still with all of that we cannot be educated into you Father we realize that this word come by revelation you choose the individuals that you desire to reveal yourself to and father I pray that your grace will be with us tonight and through your word and by your word you will reveal yourself to us more and more Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you know I stand in a position tonight I think about the world at large and I think about this song David is singing how David as we said before which that thought came originally from brother rich how the word and David was so close that God took those songs that he sang in those prayers that he prayed and made him his word and I thought by God's grace about a union of course I've been thinking about this Union before I heard that because I realized one thing that it has to be a union everything must go back to its original state and form you and I must understand that what we are now experiencing in this fallen world was not what God created we are looking at a perversion and be honest with you when you were born into this world you were born a perverted being you were not the way God intended you to be from the Guinea God is a holy God he's a righteous God it's ways the Bible says a pass finding out but I thought about a maggot you don't know what a maggot is it's dead nasty little thing that everybody screams and squirmed about when they see them it's one of those disgusting things that you and I know exist and I was thinking about that magnet maggot and I thought to myself Lord without your grace that's what I am I'm a just nasty squirmy little thing that hatched out of a dump a dump out a pile of dung and yet your mercy and your grace chose me and chose me to be transformed into something that I cannot even imagine what it's going to be like Paul tried to give us an example or some kind of heads-up and he says I have not seen no is a heard nor have entered into the hearts of a man I heard that brother Jesse preached on the seed and and and you know I know and can you imagine if that little you know read would see could think see how small it is and know that the only way that he could have actually become what he he is is that they had to have been a fire because that's why those trees burned the way they doing when they do burn they set forth those seeds but that seed can't imagine can you imagine he looks up at that tree and it can't even see them can't even see the end of it but by faith that seed can say that's me and that's the way I look at this ourselves the kind of being or the kind of creation that God is creating you and I can't even imagine we don't even know what a word body is we can't even imagine what a glorified body is all we have been used to is this old nasty thing that covers us now that imprison us to us our spirits sometimes but we know that there is a union and you know Bible says that even the heavens and the earth declare of his glory therefore amen Psalms is saying take the son for an example everybody know about the Sun that Sun goes around it's a journey and as a journey travels the same path every day never gets out of order and never is late always on time the Bible tells us amen his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing here from the heat thereof and we see Amen that this son is so faithful I love that because that son is a type of Christ that son is a type of the creator hello without the son everything dies right and that circuit Amen it's a constant the moon the stars you know in reality there is no such thing as a falling star even so we even though we said it's a meteor or some type of rock passing through because a star has been ordained to stay in this place it cannot fall but you said what the Bible says they've been the stars of heaven shall fall a man but you must understand that at that time a man there will be a flipping of the earth and of course you know you look at that and you say well what do you mean when the earth start moving it up will appear that the sons of the stars are falling but nevertheless whether it's that or not I want you to understand that God will interpret his own word and at the end of the day you and I the Bible said the heaven and the earth shall pass away but the word of the Lord shall stand when we talk about movie I love the scripture the Bible says in him we live and in him we move and in him we have all being even a man they said even as the poet has said Paul is literally quoting a poet and making that poet words scripture and we find out by the grace of God he's saying something that's far more magnificent that our minds can't conceive and that's why this way is my faith if we look at ourselves in there's no way that we can see ourselves fit for heaven some of us even feel like we're not even worthy of Earth but the Word of God tells us that this world is not worthy of us how can you figure it out because you and I must understand how beginning never was we always was with him and he is eternal when we talk about Amen Union when we talk about uniting with God in his creation I think about that there was a time there was a union when God created Adam he created Adam in a way that he could unite with the creation out of new when the birds start tweeting he knew and understand the language the birds understood his language all animals understood adam and adam understood it through all the animals hallelujah right there was a union there was a uniting that God had established in the beginning and that same union comes by way of a new birth y'all hear what I'm saying you see you said what do you mean you and I must understand that Jesus tried to teach his disciples who they really were and he told them I knew you and you were with me before the foundation of the world now you have been sprinkling amnesia you don't know who you are so I'm here to make you understand who you are and I want you to look at me carefully now because my life is the life of what a man should be so you don't know what you should be but I am the literal life is that right John said he was the light of men he was the revelation of what a man should be hallelujah when God created that man God and that man was one is that right Adam and God was one when you saw Adam you saw God not Olivia had him did the things of God Adam talked about God Adam did everything God would do when he stood upright as a man there's only after he became a fallen tree that he began to do otherwise but as he stood as a when he as long as he stood up as that holy tree of God they met he did the theme that God wanted him to do he did not have to ask God Lord is this what you want me to do see because really even though there wasn't it does say the Lord Adam was Lord he was the lord of his creation and God was the lord of Adam there was a union there was no breach there was no fussing there was no argument when he got the inspiration I understand there's a brother branham saying he said a prophet must live by inspiration hallelujah he can read the word but that were yes excuse me must come to life it must be inspired that's how we read this Bible but this Bible must be inspired it must come off the pages it must live tea with you by revelation hmm you say well what do you mean brother Brooke so like so you can understand there was no scripture for Elijah to throw a piece of wood in a river for exhale the floats there was an inspiration that was not there in a book or scroll but he was so in tune with God he was united with God that he and God was really one he said what do you mean I'm trying to give somewhere see you must understand that if the moon the stars and all these things keep that place we supposed to keep our place right this is what the holiest of holies about once you go into the Holies of Holies you should pull the curtain behind you so you'll always be there and never lose your place or position is that right that's what brother Ram said he said if when we go in there he said let God close the curtains behind us stay there because that's your original position when you're talking about uniting you talk about taking two parts and making one sometimes they come by fusion which means fire you know how people wear things together and they take the same piece of metal and they fuse it together amen it becomes one piece of metal there's different places there's a different process and these things these things takes a process you understand what I mean so what do you mean brother books listen let me sit like this as a husband and wife comes together there is a fusion of his sperm and her egg and they become one right and that's the way it is supposed to be with us but in a super natural way now you said what why why what what do you mean see that's what's so important because the Holy Ghost justifies you the Holy Ghost sanctifies you right and the Holy Ghost baptize you but listen John said he shall come with Holy Ghost and fire so when the fire comes it changes your composition hallelujah to your very nature change from adaptable nature to a holy nature you and I we will be united with something you go to new unites with something because God even put a place in your heart that must be filled and it's going to be filled either with God or the devil things of the world hallelujah it's going to happen see the thing is with this matter you cannot be neutral hallelujah see there is no purgatory if it is this must be happening right now you got heaven or hell and you and I must understand by God's grace you don't get a second chance after this that's why I love God because he's original one thing the devil messed up he didn't understand that God had already signed sealed and delivered his package before it even came to existence God knew you and I was going to thirst out to him he knew and what did he do he placed a seed on the inside of you come on somebody because he knew one day he had a date with you he knew by God's grace like like Esther Esther had to go into the king chamber there's a lot of women who went in with God and came out like concubine but when Esther came in he knew she was his match they were compatible he was a very she was the very woman he was looking for Oh somehow it just happened no sir God orchestrated it hallelujah I don't know exactly how God felt about at our vast time but if I could look at what that little seer has come to be I can see that God didn't like well God had to put our way out of the width with divorcement and said I'm gonna get me somebody else right we don't even know whatever happened to master I do y'all know if we take the system we know that God killed him somewhere he's gonna put death there right notice you might be feeling one thing over another you say brother man I'm kind of on the fence you not the Bible plainly say that all that was not sealed with the Holy Ghost received the mark of the beast zip y'all understand that I don't think people in this message understand it you don't have an option about the Holy Ghost if you're not sealed with the Holy Ghost you will receive the block of the Beast help us Jesus how I know I got the mark of the beast when you argue with the truth huh you say how can you say when you are going through what did Cain do Cain argued with the truth and God mocked him and everybody that argued with the truth of this day is mocked come on somebody we're talking about a union we're talking about letting God do his work in us and I'm gonna tell you something you the only one that could keep him from doing it because God is a gentleman he's not going to force you into anything hallelujah he ain't gonna force you to make love with him hallelujah he wants to romance you you say God wants to remain you absolutely songs of Solomon tells us that that's why I put a little bit that in my service probably something because Psalms of Solomon loved his this lady more than he said I'm gonna find you only wherever you I'm looking for you she said don't worry about it because I'm looking for you too [Laughter] hallelujah that's how you know you got God because you're always looking for him you want to find your beloved whoo even if it's me I gotta go out late at night hallelujah you know what that means that means I got a all-night prayer I'm gonna find you see I like to test it just a little bit and see where we're standing oh the mocking B's remember is a religious Lord certainly is you might be filled with religion you you could have all kinds of religion that doesn't happen that doesn't save you at all you can just be a religious fanatic if you want to be touch not taste not handle not smell not that don't that don't have one thing to do with the Holy Ghost you might be fear with a bunch of malice you might be filled with a bunch of prejudice or so full that you can't even sit and hear one sermon preached you might be filled with a lot of hatred you you despise everybody that don't agree with you you might be filled with a lot of nonsense too you might be filled with a lot of out the golfing dirty jokes you must let so much that you you think too much much of that you won't go to church on Wednesday night or something you might be filled without refreshing a rock and roll that's true I was telling somebody the other night the other day a friend of mine he asked me how do you like this music and I said let me ask you something do you believe that music you listening to will be played in heaven and he said no I see that's right let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven if you can't live or do in your living what you're doing during the daytime if it can't be done in heaven you don't need to do it y'all hear me as you do come on somebody let that will be done in earth as it is in heaven if you can't do what you're doing in heaven leave it alone ooh well you don't have to be that way Christ died that you might be cleanse from all those things you might be filled with a bunch of trees you might be filled with a bunch of denomination but God don't want you feel with that God made a place in there to put himself in God wants you to be filled with himself yeah you mean ah God whatever you gotta do feel me hallelujah what take place when you feel with God oh this is this is that is you wanna know how I know how I don't like I know I feel a man what takes place when you feel with God when you feel with God you filled with the Holy Ghost you filled with power you filled with love with joy with peace with long-suffering with goodness with meekness with gentleness with worship you filled with joy huh you filled with something and when you feel with man's ideas if you filled with churchianity if you feel weak read if you're only building yourself a Babylon that's got to fall if you fill yourself up with a modern world if you feel yourself up with lust if you feel yourself up with pride if you feel yourself up with denomination you're lost there's only one way to endure that is to put the original thing that God made that compartment in your heart to be filled with and that was the Holy Ghost that's on the way there is no other way folks no other way hallelujah is that Alright st. John 13:34 335 says a new commandment I give it to you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another is that the word but this year all men know that you are my disciples if you have loved one toward another hallelujah if God is in you the Bible said not only will you love one another but you have the ability and you will even love your enemy the Bible says he said if you hated your brother yet say you love God the Bible said you are liar hallelujah y'all hear when I'm sorry we must be so United with God that we can literally absolutely without without a hard-working job we don't have to work at it when you when you really love your enemy you don't have to work at it love is a state of being hey hey we love is didn't you that's all you if your fountain is a fountain of love that's all the people can get out of it nothing else below you know your do you know if your fountain is it says about you know you can't have a fountain this salt and sweet uh-huh no he's gonna either be salty or it's gonna be sweet you make the fountain is that Alright see God you must understand that you must see God in everything it's difficult or what god help me he saved me Oh remember I could have been crushing that actually oh that was God but we can't see God in our brothers we can't see God in our sisters oh come on somebody that's where you're supposed to see him you see God in each other hallelujah Oh people of God see that's the problem we so busy looking at the negative and we miss all the good stuff everybody in here has something to offer the body of Christ everybody in here and God has given it to you and you need to use it to the glory of God hallelujah frog don't worry about how it sounds when he seems yeah well hey but then he praises his pond whether you like it or not hallelujah and you and I misunderstand hallelujah we go praise God anyhow be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord that God he it is that do good with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee huh I don't have to worry about it when I get frustrated and worried it ain't God it's me is that I'm allowing the devil amen to preach to me and I'm saying amen to him hallelujah instead of saying amen to God trust to the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding it's only when you can unite with him when you know God you know God has never failed you you know God never will fail you he's been better a friend to you than you've been to yourself hallelujah hey people that's unite with God see and that's why the Bible said you gotta eat the whole book I eat it even if I don't understand it I eat it hallelujah how many of you have eaten bread and who you say over mind that's good I don't know what's all anybody show he is good that's all God asks you to do eat it enjoy the Word of God because that's what it's supposed to be you also enjoyed Jesus how can you say I love Jesus he can't love him this here's him hallelujah whoo say I can't understand that you ever thought about asking the man who wrote it what it means if you ask him he'll tell you hallelujah oh the bible says john 14 17 to 21 says even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him do you norm dis evening hallelujah Oh neither know him but you know him for he dwelleth with and shall be well in you hallelujah how did he get there all I know there's a day of uniting hallelujah hey man come on somebody mmm I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me see what I'm saying you supposed to see him and retain just like you see that Sun every day you supposed to see the soe in every day hallelujah that Sun is faithful and there solely it is faithful because I can't see him well who woke you up who gives you a night's sleep come on somebody you know there been times you you couldn't sleep you said O Lord please give me a little sleep the next thing you know you're waking up in the morning who did that it wasn't it said Rinna or leave no sir it was a hand of God that did it I see it how many times they meant get your tooth or something get ready to ache for some reason you say over the lord please don't let it happen next thing you know it's gone I'll come out I love him in these ways you know if God if the devil will will push you in your mind to be get to become prideful you know the Holy Ghost job is to tell you how many times he's told you that right come on you can feel some time when that little pride is there and the Holy Ghost si that's pride that's pride then what do you do you repent from it you tell him I'm sorry and if there's another individual involved you said listen I am sorry self-will got in the way right but that Bible said the Bible says at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I whoa hallelujah you mean to tell me I got to only me no just one there's only one Holy Ghost I shouldn't Ricky like that but it's the truth it sounds like you got to its not sound like a Trinity right I'm in the Father the father's in me and I am in you but it is a Trinity but it's still what he that helped my commandment and keepeth them he is that loveth me woo i'ma say that again he that have my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him I had seen God in a long time you need to check your love for him hallelujah you need to check out and see how many times I've been faithful to him everything I have been have I've been giving myself over to his will because the Bible said if you do it he will manifest himself to you hmm let's not be infidels and you know we believe God folks we will believe us we're not people who said well there is no God and I don't know him if it is one I don't know but we should never be that way hallelujah you sure have you ever seen any miraculous I don't care about you never see on the right a miraculous thing the Bible said he is holy I don't have to see things moving me and disappearing all that stuff to believe God I believe God cuz it's water here you know another reason why I believe God cuz I exist and I know because I just he does because I did not create myself and neither can I change myself but I know that there's an invisible force that's been able to change me when I couldn't even change myself by because of unity uniting with him standing in the fire burning all of the sin in a and the dross out of me consuming my worldliness lusting everything consuming it and at the same time allowing me to live who could do that say well yes III think about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the in the fiery furnace as a high in the earth - David how how how how did they survive the fire because the fire and the man in the fire became one Union United hallelujah and the Bible said it was so powerful they didn't even have a smell of fire smoke on them talk to me somebody you know that's what I'm talking about that kind of a union that if God said Philip I want you to go to the desert hallelujah Phil it won't have to say Lord I don't have a plane ticket Lord I don't have a bus ticket he said all you need is to believe huh whoo there you are that's the way it is is there are brothers where are you going because I want you to understand these are the kinds of things that we will experience before we leave here where the man said before the rapture come there would be a final outpouring of the Holy Ghost that's what he said that's gonna keep this what's gonna lift us people look at a final outpouring there will be a final output how many needed I need it I need it I believe it I'm looking forward oh yes that's God's grace brother hallelujah is that what he said in the Sears book God is not going to do this because we've been so good he's doing it because of His grace huh he's giving us this thing because of grace hallelujah oh thank God for grace yeah oh yeah remember that little story amen about that man who had those apples that Yellowjackets would eat brother band colouring infidel made mockery and font out of other Branham across brother woods brought him to go hunting say brother woods you don't got became such a low-down person you've got to carry your preacher which he's your security to make sure you do right brother hallelujah brother branham you know how it goes he found out this man is the infidel and he says yeah and this guy says and then you say you never seen God brother bear I'm talking he says well that's that's just nature he said that's right and so this man is bragging you know all these preachers I've seen the hypocrisy of it ain't nothing to them now he but there's one thing in his mind he remember there's one man who told these women amen about their illness and how they were gonna be healed in all these games and he says you know I I heard he said one day he's one night he said there was screaming and hollering up there on the hill he said I was going getting ready to go up there cuz I thought the lady's head and I he said by the time I got up there she was in the kitchen cooking so he witnessed a miracle right and he said not that's one preacher I like to I like to come to know and brother Woods before in the television not right now not right now I'm fishing here I'm fishing you see sometimes you know just like I was telling and I met this you know I was at the places like this one guy was Catholic I don't know what the other guy was but I was justified how the Lord heals and it just you know and I could tell something's going on because he got really quiet like they didn't want to hear it I'm like please this is my god you gonna hear this because you had you in my space don't get too close to me you in my space that's what the devil wants you to stop praising God when you sit some people don't want to hear it if Jeremiah had paid attention to what people was feeling he was never preached but when God get you in a place and the people don't want to hear it that means you dare to stand as a witness right so anyway I don't mean to look at you you know it's like this when you and I realized him and that everything moving by the power of God we sing that song everything moving by the power of God I rose this morning but I'm walking I'm talking right now I'm preaching by the power of God I have nothing of my own hallelujah y'all know that before God there was nothing before God don't you understand that God created the air that you breathe because he knew you was gonna need it hallelujah water everything he created for us God did meet this God was this but ever had to beauty he pulled out he had you and I in mine hallelujah you say what do you mean let me tell you something those theophanies don't need to breathe and neither do they need to eat cuz of you eat you gotta breathe huh and I'm bad I don't sleep well what do you mean the Bible said God never sleep nor slumber halleluiah he don't need these old natural things that's not that's not what makes him tick he is God and think about it Pete to be united with the Creator looks like the whole way I would want it like these old man was talking about said hey yeah we getting older but I said I'm preparing to make sure that when I leave this place I leave it right they got quiet hallelujah see that's what I'm saying he ain't no use in this oh oh oh oh I gotta get this I'm gonna grab all of this and all this you know the house is burning and you're trying to save something you get caught in the fire let it burn you know you look at these things and you you see what people grasping for and you're grasping for the wrong thing in the wrong hour we need God we need the Holy Ghost and you can't give up on the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will never give up on you nobody will be able to a lord I cried out for the Holy Ghost and you didn't give it to me you know what God gonna say to you yeah you won't in it but you didn't want it bad enough because you had a few things in your life you weren't ready to give up hey when you ready to give it all up you'll get a real burning you'll give a real real Holy Ghost and fire experience but God can see that little darkness that you're trying to hide us as oh not that yet and you don't get that yet yes you got to give it all don't you understand the joy the Holy Ghost supersedes whenever you holding onto far beyond anything you could imagine and it goes on you're not because you were that's just nature that's just nature you know oh that's just happened nothing just happens this is not a world of chance everything is orchestrated and ordered by God written down in the book God don't come up with some things oh but I gotta come up with something now because it's getting boring No Oh hallelujah the book is already written hallelujah even when God changes courses don't you know that course has already been changed he said what do you mean like for instant when Jonah amen didn't want to go preach to Nineveh hallelujah God beat Jonah to the punch while Jonah was caring old God was already preparing a fish for him he knew the path he was gonna take just like you and I God knows the path we gonna take oh I didn't do what God say do we all yes you did some time you think you didn't but you did God got you right where he wants you to be hallelujah world nature well is nature intelligence see angular sada yet oh that's yes if nature's intelligence then intelligence is God right right nature is not something that's gonna happen like these scientists say oh don't you know your gram grandpa your great grand whatever he's oh it was a rock lightning struck the rock and he started breathing you know people are so scientifically I shouldn't use that word I'm not gonna it's a word I was going I can't use it but let me tell you something people gonna find out how foolish is it is even about sidewise versions and foolish versions you love the lord give me a few more minutes but what intelligence running the SAP down at the root right if it's just if it's just it was just nature they said put a bucket on top of the pole and let's see whether that water would run through that bucket right down the pole know what makes that what that net that SAP in the tree go down to the roots and high duel in wintertime and didn't know what time to come up now you and I we water the grass I got sprinklers a man and then we break to the grass and that dad toast those grass the grass and everything almost laugh at the sprinkler see you to produce something it'll keep a lot stay alive but let it rain one good time what does that rain bringing that I'm not giving okay he giving is bringing to that grass guard chemistry what God has put in that rain for that grass and those flowers to grow in the trees to grow you and I with our water system came in touch it what's in the rain life and don't you know when we mix stuff up we produce death there's a group someplace you put that water and they just die hallelujah think about it the question was asked and that's what I love about because you got to understand the only way you gonna get up out of the grave is that you have the Holy Ghost if that same spirit being you that was also in Christ Jesus asked it quick and his body will quicken yours but it must be the same Holy Ghost hallelujah yes that's what I'm saying minister blows even its age this is the age of deception you know people that were all if I shout if I dance if I jumped if I run my speaking tongues I got it yeah you got it but you don't know what it is it must be the Holy Ghost and if it is all he goes it's gonna live holy it's totally righteous it's going to live sanctified you say well I'll make him say yes you'll make mistakes but there are certain things amen the Holy Ghost will not allow you to do yaja me it's me people's well you know I know everybody praise the Lord but mine it ain't in my nature to do it that's your problem you still got your nature you don't need your nature your nature's are is damnable you need the nature of God you say oh you know you know it ain't in my nature to just you know praise God what that's the problem it ain't in your nature it wasn't even in case nature hallelujah but when you got the right nature it's gonna say Amen it may not scream as loud as everybody else but it's gonna say Amen yeah and you said all brothers what do you say what I'm trying to say is that somehow we've got to get away from this carnal nature this carnal mind it's not meditating on the word I want to get so close to him it meant that if he say walk through the wall it won't be no job I won't have to blow a hole in and I just walk through it you said that's not possible in here what you think the raps are going to be everybody will be outside people are being at homes people be on their jobs people are be in their beds but at the moment in the twinklin and I will go up through the ceiling through the wall whatever wherever we may be hallelujah we'll be so United with Christ amen that these elements here no longer becomes a chamber or bondage we become God of the elements somebody should have shouted over we become God or the elements what do you mean brothers listen that's what made Jesus so the way he is even though he was the son of God and he was God the Bible said yes all ye are gods hallelujah why did Jesus rebuking his up disciples when they couldn't calm the storm because they were supposed to be united with the world he had taught them he taught them you have you you could tread upon serpents amen you can cast out Devils it he said listen if something great pause and nothing shall harm you he gave him the authority like he did the game he gave it to Adam in the beginning Adam in the beginning had even so United with God he was the god of the elements whatever Adam said that elements had to obey hallelujah and you and I must understand this is where this message is taking us no eyes have not seen nor ears of it hurt but I believe with all my heart hallelujah God didn't call us to be gods Amen when we just to sit down and not do nothing he came to manifest the word of this day hallelujah and you and I must understand this is where God is taking us into such a union hallelujah I am in the father the father's in me and I am in you hallelujah and God said amen I have now given power all power in heaven and earth key to Jesus himself and if Jesus in you all power in heaven and earth is in us hallelujah hallelujah see when you really see God and everything everything becomes beautiful one time a man was going to the seashore for a little rest he wanted to smell the freshness of the sea sea water he wanted to hear the wild scream of the seagulls he wanted to watch the great waves he as a salt water burst up into the great big waves and splash to roll back to splash again oh he was so thrilled to know that he would be down by the seashore he longed to see and enjoy the presence of the sea on his road down he met her Oh salt as a salt is an old sailor and he said where are you going he said down to the seashore to enjoy the blessings of the roaring of the sea to see the waves as they jump and to hear the gulls and he said they're just Birds that's just salt water I don't see anything to be thrilled about what was it what was the matter he has seen it so much and then it become so common to him till he didn't notice it anymore hmm that's how it is become with us so many of us have seen God do so many thing and just become a common thing and you know we become blind to it we don't even see when God is moving here is that right and you know the Prophet God said the move of God would be so simple if you're not careful it'll pass right through you and you won't even know it you see them saying well not because we're allowing these supernatural things that just you know we're not glorifying God we're not praising God for these things hallelujah ah you know I think about it I was telling the brother just witnessing to him today I said you know what God gave me an illiterate mother who couldn't even tell me how to read didn't know how to tell me you know couldn't couldn't rehearse or abies ABCs nothing like that I said but all she can do is say make sure you do your homework Junior junior did you do your homework see she still was my cheerleader you understand me God she gave me a mother who couldn't read and I saw more God and her did I see in some of these message people y'all hear me hallelujah it wasn't a talk-show she lived it no come on somebody you see what I'm saying you don't have to be a smart man to know God most of the time when you learn you got too much money you never come to see him you want to reason away they spray this hallelujah but the Bible said the just shall live by his faith hallelujah a man this is what happened people say that's not logical oh my god you're not logical if you really think the science is God you think Amen people evolved from some monkey or tadpole or something that's your logic people do that y'all heard what I said that's all Southern people do that that's what they do would you take a little ignorant fella like Peter all he knows how to do is fish does they come follow me hallelujah Lord Jesus help me that's all God want us to do is humble ourselves to it acknowledge your failure knowledge you were nothing and then that's when God will make you something God said if you humble yourself he will exalt you in due time y'all believe that oh think about it people I don't know what this glorified body is gonna be like I don't know how it's going to appear but I know one thing my mind can't even conceive it you never get hungry thirsty or you never died you never grow old you know you can't even imagine what it's like but I'm looking for it for the journey hallelujah I've started this journey ain't no way for me to turn back now think about it you and I with John jesus said I and my father are one well 10:30 I love that that's one of my favorite read but cause piece of what he's to people say they three I said you just don't understand the oneness of God hallelujah how can you be one with God and make it how many I mean what would be the number of God if all of us was added like that hallelujah just like I said the Bible said there's the number that no man can number and guess what God only has one bride she listen one more time louie louie gohmert quit at 8:30 he said when Christ was on the earth in a physical corporal body and we stand today he walked in Galilee in different places there he claimed not to have power to heal the sick or to perform miracles he said I can't do nothing in myself the moment you think you can do something you are out of the will of God oh I can preach you can't preach oh I can sing you can't sing oh I can play you can't play don't you realize is God displaying it's gone to give you the straight to play God that gives you the knowledge to pray God that gives you the wisdom all those things come from God how can you claim something that's not even yours that's why God don't like that arrogance and all that I'm something you ain't nothing Oh God can drop you like a man in in an instant and have the worms eat you up before man can blame em nothing no no no I do nothing first til the Father show me what to do anyone knows the scripture says John 5 knows that that is true he did not perform any miracles and her father showed him he said verily verily I say unto you see but will see their ears theirs - oh let me put it this way the divine eternal Elohim will never be placed in one single bottle you cannot confine him he's not outside of space he is space he's everything hallelujah about said in Jesus Christ was the food is of the Godhead bodily he said what do you mean brother explain that to me when he went down to the tomb and he saw Lazarus dead the Bible said he wept that was a man but when he rolled back his chest his toters and said comfort that was not a man that was God y'all understanding people's are all we're gonna kill you we gonna stone you because you are man making yourself God but you just had to do is rotate it balance hallelujah he wasn't a man making himself god it was God making himself a man hallelujah and what is he doing now a new creation hallelujah what is he doing now amen he's creating all over again and the world looking right at us and can't comprehend it the Bible said darkness can comprehend light hallelujah they can't see us amen all they can see is this old badger screen but only in the inside of this hallelujah is a new man hallelujah amen a man born by power born with fire hallelujah a new man hallelujah created out the image of God fairly I severely I said to you the son himself the tabernacle of God dwell in his body the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise right for an example you go buy a coke you ain't going to the stove for the bottle it ain't the problem that's called coke it's what's in the bottle called coke and that's it it was what was in the bottle of Jesus Christ was God the bottle could break the bottle died but the substance that was in him could never die that's why God don't give you two souls one got to die and when the true soul of God comes in you you're not I'm there Brooks of natural and God of spiritual you're actually God in human flesh oh I can't say it that's why we can't stop til we see the very little life of God living in us don't you stop beat you fight every day but you got to have it in your mind I'm conquering this one of these old days it's got to be gold hallelujah I'm conquering this yes I might not be able to whip you today Phyllis time but I'm gonna get you at the end of the day right because you know it has been ordained for me to whip you is that right Paul said with more than couplers who Christ Caesar hallelujah no devil no grave can hold my body down nothing can stop us now why because of the life of Christ it ain't us is him when that Sun comes up he meant all of the darkness don't fee at all at one time he grabbed he moves as that son growing strength that darkness scatters hallelujah and watch it brothers and sisters as the light of God grow strongly and strollin you the darkness of this world must leave it has no option hallelujah to stay in your life read this quote and we'll stop here it is the only grounds of fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself in the church is the oneness of himself in the people woo that's the only ground of fellowship the only way that you can have those are grounds is by Union to be united with him forever just like when you unite with your husband the woman to unite with her husband it is a vow unto death now then when you unite with God it's the same thing that the church unites with Christ is until death we part and then if you never sin or do anything wrong you'll be eternally United with God and the only death can take you away from God and not physically death but the sin of death sin is death and that takes you away from God so to be united with him in the spirit of his power is eternal life and your return you've eternal life eternally United with God he said oh I want to get to that altar being United eternally with the eternal God perfectly in harmony with him perfectly United together a church that all both God and His Church is one United together see you said what do you mean that's what we talked about we talked about growing up into him when that full statue of Christ is now developed in you amen you are totally totally United with God hallelujah and if you notice how that he was united with Adam she come part of him now if I'm not reading with the scripture tell me but this is truth yeah I mean this is true if heaven is so holy and no unclean thing is going to enter in how are you gonna get there that's why the Bible said if that see remaineth in you you cannot see in when that seed is quickening you god don't look at you no more he's looking at the seed he's watching over that seed like a eagle with her egg to make sure that seed come to a full maturity so let's see B birth and learn how to fly and become grown that's what God is all about hallelujah God don't forsake his seed hallelujah he's always with us always will be with us hallelujah is that right yeah yeah I know y'all have seen trees and apple trees and plum trees now one of those plums on that tree is exactly alike yet they came from the same tree some big clump so I'm bigger than the other one some smaller than the other with some juicy or some sweeter same tree huh yo yo see nature today to declare his glory you think about all those characters that came from Adam and how they were because of nature change because of the fall in the nature huh what about Jacob Jacob didn't look like a son he's a rascal I look at Tom as I said and I always say if Thomas made it I'm gonna make it to [Laughter] you understand I look at all of these people to make love hurt Holly knew it you know I'll make many mistakes myself but hey come on now Solomon did a lot of stuff it's all about sitting in the throne where ever Solomon is I'll be there too hallelujah why his grace not one man is sitting in heaven right now because of his works everything has been bad grades but Enoch was translating yes cuz God had favor found favor with him why because God gave him what he needed that wasn't a work of Enoch you know what God we look at that like Enoch did it himself hallelujah every man man's righteousness is like filthy rags to God hallelujah don't you know Abel would not have made it this God's grace when here was with him and revealed unto him the blood sacrifice it still was God that's why the Bible said blessed is the man who hears the sayings and above don't you understand this message blesses you it blesses you I heard brother Branham preaching this morning he said don't you worry don't you fear God gonna have him a bride God gonna have him a church united under one hand hallelujah God will have us United there ain't no is if the buts about the bride will find her proper place and she will humble herself to the word and then we'll take a rapture he's you know what he said he said you know God might have to use persecution to bring us all together I don't care let it be so I'm all for that because the closer we get to get each other and the more unifying we get to each other the closer we are to home going home amen whoo ah Lord Lord see we don't see that great picture we're in the flesh our difference we're like a by-product a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are sons and daughters not some other spirit but the Spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become sons and daughters not separate but the same spirit the same God the same person join in well our to the eternal well see how God planned it we should be not a different but him not some other being of some other tribe but a real union in all spring of the almighty done by a holy union not the body comes from a mother a father but the spirit comes from God God separating himself as Adam was separated whoa listen one day of Pentecost we find the Holy Ghost the appeal of fire separating himself and setting upon each member of that church God putting himself together whoo hear what he said God putting himself together then with that group of the people together what does he do bring back the unified party of the Lord Jesus he says coming together that's what the Holy Ghost does it brings God back together hallelujah he broke it and he said one day that Brady say one day you understand this you remember me but now God has taken them pieces and bringing them back together hallelujah back to one body hallelujah I'm not doing but I finished I I keep working on this I've said to myself I said Lord I said I want to bring something because you know I look at the supernatural I look at him you know Peter James and John and you take for instance let's go back to this first of all you know when Paul was on his way to admit to Damascus and he was going to persecute the Christian and of course the light shine from heaven and and then Paul asked Lord who our Lord and he said Jesus Paul had never seen it Paul had never heard his voice but that day Paul knew that Jesus wasn't just one man anymore he was not just one man he was a member of my of my what it was a multi-member body and think about all those ones that he blast calls a blaspheme and put to death and Jesus was still living oh my god see you look at this thing you say what do you mean brother this thing is so wonderful to me the devil understand he try to kill us by tear Jesus by killing us you can't kill Jesus he still lives and when you do when this body die you're doing a favor you know the journey is over we go back to where we came from hallelujah and the devil you think this is the last time he gonna see you he gonna see you again if I die tonight he gonna see me again where I'll be right at that white throne judgment not being judged but judging I'll be with him you'll be with him as his wife as his bride sitting with him in his throne hallelujah wow that old movie moves right across the screen see all that you've done that's been covered by the blood I don't know how he's gonna do it but he's gonna move it out of the way I don't know how he's gonna fix the film but the field would be fixed imitates brother no evidence hallelujah oh my god and think about him and everybody that you know fail to get under the blood of Jesus every sin every thought every desire will be displayed there'll be no hiding place you won't be able to say oh lord I didn't do that no that wasn't me oh yes sir don't you know you got a lot of look-alikes but God gonna know you yeah you're gonna say that's the fellow who look like me no son God knows you you know we so blessed people you know all I can say at God's appointed time I will walk completely perfect before him in my journey it's in your journey like it was with Enoch Enoch walked with God as long as you're walking with Him perfection and the rapture is yours hallelujah you love the Lord last day coming to a place where you you you are God over the elements he said Mary said whatever he said do do it say well know what you want me to do display when I got before my time go get me six pots fill it up with water before you know it the water was turned into wine and no man at that wedding says my goodness you know I'm sorry you're not going to a lot of ways before usually serve the bad stuff at the end because you're so drunk you can't tell the difference he said but now I could tell that this wine is better than the first hallelujah don't you understand what God did God saved us to the last where are we ah right there was a six vessels there Amen that had man made but that seventh one was made by God six denominations with that seventh one represented eternal life and you and I are the ones we're the vessels with the new wine that's better than the first Oh Lord think about it father
