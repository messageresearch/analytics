thank you [Music] [Music] i [Music] now that felt good hallelujah you know the master of the wind thank you brother and we're gonna go right into the scripture we appreciate all that you do all that everybody does around here it's wonderful i was thinking such an inspiration struck me this morning when i was ministering and where two or three are gathered in my name oftentimes we think two or three is working with just numbers but it's more to it than that because those two or three has to be on one accord must have the same mind and the same determination in order for god to move you you can have two or three but if you got one in there that's doubting or two that's doubting it's not the same effect the bible says a two-quarter strong but a three chord is hard to break and i was just thinking about how that if we could get the people of god just two or three on one accord we can really see god do something in this place set our mind on a revival and when i mean revival i don't mean jumping and shouting i mean a cleaning house and getting our minds and hearts set on the coming of the lord we can really see something take place by the grace of god as we stand let us turn to second corinthians we're gonna go there the third chapter and then from second corinthians we ask that you turn with us by the grace of god to romans the eighth chapter i'm very excited it may not look like i am but i am i feel right now as light as a feather and i know that's god if i got on a natural man scale it wouldn't be be that but i really feel good in my soul and uh as a as of as of what i know now there is nothing hindering my soul and i surely thank god for that second corinthians the third chapter we got we're going to read there at the 17th verse we appreciate the word of god i am looking with expectation for the translation and i don't want nobody to interrupt me i got my mind made up and i won't turn back hallelujah ii corinthians the third chapter and um the 17th verse i i i'm i'm seeing grace in such a way that i've never seen it before uh it's always been there but grace when once revealed causes you to love god it's no longer law it causes you to love god when you see the amount of grace that he's bestowed upon us second corinthians 3 17. let's go to the 16th verse that's that's more appropriate nevertheless when he shelter and to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are charged or excuse me are changed in the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord and if you remember in my early messengers message is i showed the difference between being formed in his image and being formed in his likeness the difference between the two in his image we're working with the theophany we're working with the very character and nature of god adam was first created in the image he was first a spiritual man then he was created a natural man which was his likeness that's why the bible says image and lightness but here the scripture is telling us that in this day we're being created into his image he's not even working with the natural man he's working with the image of the inner man let us turn now by god's grace to romans the eighth chapter don't you just love a god like that a god who creates hallelujah he doesn't leave his creation up to us right hallelujah he creates he's the master builder amen so romans 8 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make an intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercessions for the saints according to the will of god and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called for whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to all these things if god be for us who can be against us let us pray father god we come before you lord and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us lord you have been a million times better to ourselves to us than we've been to ourselves lord the number cannot even be counted i can walk through my daily life and see where grace has met me grace has met me grace has met me grace has met me hallelujah and i am so grateful for your amazing grace forgive us for anything we may have said or done that has not been pleasing in our sight and i pray pray tonight oh god that you would just help us and show us lord teach us and guide us most of all cause us to love you as you love us we want to be that union of of saint john 17 where you say i am in the father the father's in me and i am in you that's what we want that's what we thirst for so let it be according to your will in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated hallelujah god is so good to us i say that all the time and i honestly don't get tired of saying it because it's so true it's so true it's so true and sometimes when i think about his goodness i almost lose my mind i feel like if i just let go i might not come back because i can see it it's so crystal clear to me knowing where i came from and know where i am now and where i'm going and i know that everything has been ordered by the lord and when we come to this day i was thinking about this new year and now uh first sunday of the new year and and and how god has really blessed us amen how he brought us through 2020 and of course 2020 represented perfect vision and as i said last night or this morning if you in 2020 if you didn't see your position and where you stood in god because god was showing all of us where we were spiritually up the scale whether we were in the valley on the plains or a mountaintop god showed us we must be honest let's face the facts but they're there he just didn't leave us there right he's he's telling us amen that there's room for improvement and understand no man can add a cubit to his statue but i i thought to myself because i was listening to the message living he loved me you know living loving you know you know that that and i saw the adept of the resurrection or the death of his death in a way i had never seen before and you know the prophet god says that no man could have died that death no one could have done that jesus christ was the only man designed to do it and i often think how many times the enemy perhaps tried to make him quit or stop in the process but the bible said he set himself his face like a flint he was determined you see he wasn't about saving himself like that like they screamed out you know you save others but you can't save yourself and how true that was it's not that he couldn't save himself he didn't want to save himself because there were others he wanted to save and oftentimes you know you know i heard somebody on on the youtube he was talking about oh early christians how early christians were ashamed of how they worship and i thought oh you missed it early christians never was ashamed of how they worship it was the counterfeits that came along afterwards who became ashamed of the way the spirit of god would move them it's always been that way but when i look at this message and that's why i keep bringing something to god keep bringing something opening more and more and more to me because as we said that here in the church ages were rules and regulations you know justification and you know how that was and then sanctification when wesley came it was the method is you had to do it this way and that way and you couldn't do this it was touch not taste not hand or not it was and that kind of a trend went all the way throughout even up to pentecost or and then you know brother branham brought it to our attention it wouldn't last it didn't last he said if the methodist could really see what the the methodist of that day was doing he said they would turn over in their graves why because the natural the standard of sanctification in which they laid out was now gone i mean even when it comes to holiness and pentecostalism you you look at the standard and you find out that what the problem was it was always law and never grace you see and only grace can come when you actually see grace you can receive grace grace in itself is a revelation that produces love you understand me because it's one way of loving god you can be made to do something but the bible said the goodness of the lord ought to lead the man into repentance right so there's a different level there's a different element there's a different level of grace that god tries to bring us into and and and here we understand it finally we we get it because the bible tells us that the capstone the headstone comes down with grace grace he started the church with grace and he ends the church with grace right and you must understand that the grace of god is the unmerited love and favor that god has or have toward us right it has nothing to do with you it's all about god god chose you god chose me i am so glad about it and think about it one in a million in this age god chooses us and think about it that even in this age among ourselves how god is dealing with you as an individual and the man or the woman who sits next to you he may not they may not even hear or even understand what's going on one thing i know about life is there's nothing that can control life hello because god is life i remember the time i preached a message years and years ago penetration and i literally got that story of that that inspiration because i was walking along and i was watching the pavement and i saw a little piece of grass coming up through the pavement it didn't go around it it was coming up through that pavement and i was amazed and i thought well how on earth did that happen how was how is that possible see because nothing can hinder life the grave couldn't hallelujah the grave couldn't hold him you understand me stone they rolled a stone amen over the grave and they thought they could hold life you can't capture life life is god and i saw that little piece of gray grass come up through that blade that that pavement and i thought oh how heavy that and concentrated that that that that that pavement was that that brick that man-made brick like you know what i'm saying that man-made brick those cages those things that the the the dominations put us in and try to cage us in but you can't cages you can't cages and then because why that seed hear the voice of god come out of her my people and no matter how thick the walls are it they may even seem uh in when you can't penetrate it but god's word penetrates all darkness and that light strikes that seed you can be a catholic you could be a buddha a allah a muslim hinduism it doesn't matter how thick the walls are how heavy it is if the seed of god is in you when the light strikes it penetrates all man-made traditions you understand me it cannot be conquered no element no time no space can ever conquer life amen because life is god and think about it how invincible you are i'm not talking about your flesh but i'm talking about the life that's in you through christ we don't worry about death death doesn't scare us because we understand we've already passed from death unto life we are invincible and the devil knows it and all the devil can do or all the devil can try to do is make your life miserable here but he cannot stop your resurrection no wonder in the preview of the church brother branham saw the christian church marching so i want you to understand that even when we came through the church ages that was really a platform that was what what brother balum called it a bogus now understand there was life in there but it wasn't the original life being seen original life went down in the day of pentecost in the early church in the ephesus age and it went down there and it died and it came up like a stalk but we could never see the original right what they did on the day of pentecost and prior to that we could not see that we saw little bits and pieces of this that and the other now watch this because even in azusa street 1906 they thought that was the life the the thing that would bring the resurrection but that was just the restoration of the gifts and i'm preaching tonight because i've got some quotes but nevertheless the prophet god said they thought that was going to produce the rapture and it did not why because it was just the restoration of the gifts it was just the shock the thing that looked like the original life but that wasn't it so that's why he basically said when it comes to speaking in tongues shouting dancing healing raising the dead we've seen all of that but that's not it amen why because even in that age you had impersonators you had demonic power working within the framework of the pentecostal realm and the people did not even know the difference hallelujah but then god sent a prophet a seer that was greater than their mediums you know because a lot of christians still go to mediums right but a true prophet of god no matter how small the gift or how great the gift is he always magnify the lord jesus christ nothing can conquer the word y'all know that we don't even know when god said let there be light how long ago that's been hallelujah is that right you know we get so tied up with traditions and and things of men you know you know i yeah i just recently learned that you know celebrating birthdays you know as hedonistic just like celebrating chris christmas but you know i ain't going there but my point is you know i i i'm not criticizing nobody if that's what they want to do my point is that don't save you neither does it make you lost see you're saved by the grace of god you know that's why brother branham handles what he said well yeah even easter be careful because even easter amen is it's it comes from wrong now y'all come on now the truth of the matter is you're going to meet some jehovah witness and they're going to ask you you know they're going to tell you or a seven day event is it's gonna say well you know we need we must uh you know worship on on the seventh day and so you ask him then when is the seventh day because we can only go back when men start making calendars and who's to say his calendar is right but then we're supposed to worship on sunday when then how do you know when when the day of sunderland a crooked true christian worships every day we've set aside sunday but we don't know whether the sunday that we celebrate is a sunday that could be a monday tuesday or wednesday all we know is that he was resurrected on that day now when you get technical nobody knows because everybody had calendars if you don't want to you say well i you're following wrong well then what calendar you think you're following right so we can technical things we can look at these things and say but my point is does it matter at the end of the day we've come to do what worship god in spirit and in truth right we're not here to to bring a judgment on nobody we're here as individuals to make this revelation that has been preached to us in this end time really i believe it was november 17th brother branham said that noah went into the ark and nobody knows when november 17 was i know november 17 might be somebody else's november but you god don't pay no attention to that god looks at your heart and your effort in what you're trying to do we get hung up on dates and times and paul said don't do that that's beggarly that means nothing right don't lower yourself like that god has brought you a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth and and and and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty is that right that's why david said no i'm hungry and i'm going to eat this all right jesus went into somebody's field and said oh okay there's corn we're going to eat this right and when you say well see but people can get all strung up on times and laws and rules and and i'm not throwing up but i want you to understand that we are being made free and we must understand what this message come to bring us we we can't have nothing tying us down absolutely nothing and he whom the son is made free is free indeed and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty you understand me the only way a man can ever grow in christ is that christ bring the growth right take the life out of anything and it's dead right the only thing that brings you into a perfection is the life in you growing up into christ hallelujah it is it don't get me wrong if you know order to do good and doeth not your sin but understand the working of life how many of you all have seen yourself grow naturally the only thing we know is sometimes we need a haircut but none of us seen the strands of our hair or grow huh come on you understand what i'm trying to get you to somewhere because i want you to understand amen that we're not in a system we have been made free and the point is if you know it to do good and do it to not it is sin it doesn't our freedom doesn't give us liberty to sin because when god when jesus christ was raised from the dead guess what sin died now i want you to understand what i'm saying to the believer sin is dead in other words to the believer there is no unbelief oh come on somebody that's what sin is it's unbelief and when the word comes we don't have to understand it we don't have to explain it we say like mary be it unto me according to thy word this is what god brings to us coming from the quote amen if this is okay with you i'm gonna read this the spoken word is the original seed because i look at these things and i'm so glad for genesis 1 11 where it says every seed shall break forth of its kind i'm happy about that because i realize that i'm not doing the same it's not him that willeth nor he that runeth but god that who showeth mercy right it's god who's doing this thing in us nobody will be able to boast a brag and i'm not getting that from any of you but i'm bringing this to you so you can understand we have no room for pride and arrogance there is no room the bible tells us that humility bring god's on the scene and all of your growth will determine on how humble you can be you know did you know that dying and rotting means to yield to god's will set yours aside and yield to god's will hallelujah nothing can conquer the word so let me ask you a question then if that be true then who are you what portion do you fit feel in this scripture jesus christ had to come in here in the bible and find his position right remember amen when he opened up the scripture he went to isaiah right and talked about how amen the captain would be set free and all of these things and then he goes on to say and this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he understood where he was in the word nothing could take him away from that nothing could deter him from being that he was that and he proved it by character and by the life he lived you see what i'm saying now he says now here's what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bring forth of its kind hallelujah so you're saying what if the seed of god is in you if the life is in you it brings forth of is kind i'm gonna say it again see because you know why we have been so used to the teachings of the organizations to we always want to put our hands to it now it it almost seems uh uh like you know i'm trying to preach something hypocritical but i'm trying to say this when a man pray is when he connects with god he gets into the shekinah glory he's just laying there praying it is the shekinah it is the life of god that then takes over and produces the character take all of the greenness out take all of the deadness out and produces what life would bring in you right you're not in there flexing your muscles you're not in there trying to prove to god what you can do you're laying as a dead man so that god can work in you and through you that's why so many people christians get frustrated i've been there lord i ain't gonna do that ever again boom whenever you say something like that god says okay talk talk to him devil god will let the devil trip you hallelujah if you said lord's willing that makes a difference then you put put your desire into the will of the lord right and the will of the lord is that you what prosper even as your soul prosper he wants you to prosper so when you set your will into the will of god then you put your problems into god's hand and now it's god's business to make the change hallelujah see the law of reproduction yeah it is you know i sometimes this this thing that bothers me sometimes but that's the way a tree is made you know a tree you know don't hop up and walk and go where it wants to go and it can't say well you know that water on the other side of the river looks fresher to me and i think i'm going to uproot myself and go over there that tree is steadfast your trees anchored in the word as long as you anchor yourself in the word don't move because god is going to bring the sunshine the rain the storms he's going to prune your limbs anything that's not doing right he's going to cut it off you might have a little few lightning flashes in your life but my point is you ain't cut and as the storm rock you and real a little bit what the brother said about that your roots are getting deeper the storms are good for you right so this is the way nature works nature works and so i say all of this to say don't think that you and i gonna get out of this dimension on a bed of ease the storm is coming but it's there he said listen genesis 1 11 and he goes on to say these last days the true church bride comes to the headstone will be the super church a super race nearing the great headstone this is what i'm saying we can't just leave amen the headstone separate the holy ghost unites us is a invisible union and i think that's what people it looked like it's a space in there but no no that is a union there's a union there and what people don't see is because it's invisible we don't have lines why because that union is eternal there's no lines with us how eternal can you be box can hold you what line can hold you there's nothing that can hold you not even this body because when you die this soul and the spirit leaves this body and connects with another you understand what the essence of a true believer is god all that god is you are now there is no way to explain it you got to believe it mary said to the angel lord how can this thing be how can i bring forth a child and i don't know a man right and that's what a lot of people think well let me ask you a question what happened to the eunuch that philip witnessed to was caught up what happened to him you know what he'll be there what organization or denomination where were they when god met the woman at the well told her of herself i gave her the revelation she's one of them huh what about mary when she came and found him at simon's house they were all gathered around but not one of them could touch her heart like jesus did he said to her woman go your sins are forgiven go and sin no more no man had anything to do with that what about the thief on the cross he was born free every true child of god is born free no matter where you get born at you're born free god gives the birth we admire each other we collect together because we're believers hallelujah but at the end of the day amen because i'm joined in fellowship with you doesn't doesn't guarantee me salvation the only thing that guarantees me salvation is that i have met jesus christ on his grounds that's it hallelujah i'm glad to be a christian am i fault-free no sir in my eyes i see what i mean my thoughts are that my faults but in his eyes i'm perfect hallelujah now you can't understand it unless you're under the blood hallelujah and when you honor the blood there's no charge against you why the bible says there is now no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that means if you got the holy ghost your desire is to do what he wants you to do you might stumble you might fall but god said there's no condemnation a super race now understand this when we say super race everybody puts everything here and like the problem god said and i'm not going to be long tonight but the prophet god said this he said you know we always look at what jesus did yesterday and we always look at jesus what he's going to do tomorrow hallelujah but you know what we forget what he's doing today what is he doing now i'm gonna tell you what he's doing i'm gonna tell you whether you know this or not he is literally forming and shaping individuals into his image right before your eyes but the truth of the matter is you can't see it because it's veiled by human flesh hallelujah but one all these old days the glory that moses had will not be even compared to the glory that god has for his bride is that right when moses came off to that mountain he had to veil his face because of the glory of the lord hallelujah and guess what even because of that they still talk about moses today they forgot to see that there was something behind that veil that caused moses to glow oh jesus help us lord i am so glad to be a christian i am so so people say satisfied i don't wanna i don't understand whether satisfied is such a a weak word for me because it's more than satisfied i'm elated huh it illuminates me it causes me it causes thrills when i think about what god has done for me and what he's doing for me he said they would be so much like him even they will be in his very image i get that he didn't say likeness he said image in other words god is working on the inner man the christ in you being formed into the christ right in you the very virtues of god being formed and framed in you and we know that's victory right the father's will pressure right turning you around whatever the whole point is this we are in a in a in a process right now where god is creating a game what is he creating his own son jesus christ the beginning of god's creation hallelujah what is he doing creating a game what do you mean what do you mean he first created the male then he came back and created the female from the male right and what is it that's why jesus adam said to eve you're born in my bone and flesh of my flesh in other words we're made out of the same substance my holiness is your holiness the holy ghost that that causes me to live is the same holy ghost you god right it is god it's the essence of god in us and all god is saying to us submit to my word and you'll see the glory of god right what happened the first son what happened to him he failed when god came back gave him the word test the devil calls him the fall understand here was adam and here was adam mr adam and mrs adam then miss adam fell here and in order for them to be united mr adam had to come here too because they were on this on different planes after she failed he had to fall in order to unite hallelujah but in this case our adam is here we're here and we must come up hallelujah because he's already lowered himself as much as he possibly can low himself right think about the god of heaven becoming the man he becomes sin that we might become his righteousness oh i don't understand it it's like people don't understand the gospel and the reason why they won't try it or want it because they don't understand what it is people say well i don't want to go to hell that ain't it nobody really wants to go to hell oh is that the truth but that ain't it this is a love affair god wants someone who's going to love him for who he is right when it comes to the bride of jesus christ the lord has eternal vision you know what i mean y'all know have you seen people with tunnel vision you can tell that you can tell that person say listen you know i think something wrong with her but if that guy's in love with her you can say all you want to say he can't see it and don't want to hear it and the only thing that can break tunnel vision when you see that there's a couple that ain't right is prayer because all your talking ain't going to do any good well let me say like that's that's the way god is with us satan is the accuser he can say whatever he want to say about us but god has tunnel vision for us he loves us so much that no matter what the devil says he doesn't listen why because god knows those who he came to redeem hallelujah and he loved us before he redeemed us oh lord help us jesus i'm taking my time understand this that god knew that in this flesh and you know this flesh is really it's kind of like a form of a serpent you know he always gets you in trouble it's a hybrid and i don't care how you try to tame it you know what i mean it's going to do whatever if we want to do that's why paul said kill it you have to kill this thing you have to put the will of the flesh underneath your feet every day throughout the day every time you try to raise up his head you got to bring him down the bible said cast down every evil imagination see that's where the devil anoints your flesh to bring you to a place of failure so you have to stop him right there and how do you stop him oh you don't say stop speaking in tongues that ain't gonna stop the devil you can shout and that ain't gonna stop him you know the only thing that stops the devil is the word learn the word and learn how to speak the word you don't even have to feel it when you speak it you don't need a thunderbolt or you don't need the hands on your head to stand up or to win come by speak the word and believe it and it'll come to pass you love the lord the bible says we're more than conquerors and i believe that and you know how that is you know the story about that the man goes to work he makes all the money right and he comes back home and gives his wife the paycheck well she's the more than the conqueror she didn't have to work for it or sweat or brow but she takes the check he works for it right so she's more than a conqueror so my my understanding is this you know people say i'm a survivor i'm not a survivor survivor means that you just bail you just made it i'm a conqueror that means i had an opposition i had an opponent and it may have looked like he was going to get the best of me but i conquered him i defeated him i turned the the the whole scene around where he's at the bottom and i'm on the top at the top jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever we are predestinated that means amen god is already determined because he knew what we would do right he doesn't make any of us serve him that's what my brother said uh uh well why should i serve a goddess that's got to make you serve i say that ain't it god don't make us serve him everybody that have hardships and hard times don't come to the lord no some people heart gets harder against god they end up in hell because they resist him right and never think about who's giving them strength who's giving them life they never think about who gave them the intelligence to think and to work and uh they never think about science science what science got to do with it like my son said i'm going to worship the god that made science huh science guy has nothing to do with it in the beginning god said that's that's what it is and when we come to a place and people well i don't think i want to serve the lord because you know why you don't want to serve the lord you just don't know how good it is maybe you haven't seen the right example of christianity hallelujah but if you get a taste like i told somebody you get a taste of the holy ghost you'll never want anything else you know what you're going to do want more of it hallelujah i used to be afraid of the holy ghost what i thought was the holy ghost anyway because my mama used to shout and speak in tongues and jerk and i find myself doing the same thing now but it used to look like it hurt you know you know and uh i used to be afraid of it and i told her i said lord i'm afraid i wasn't ashamed to tell him i was but i said but i but i want it i didn't know what it was going to be like but oh my when i got a taste of the holy ghost i was dancing everywhere i came home speaking in tongues and my family say i don't think you're supposed to be doing that here dude because i was a child i couldn't control what i was doing but by god's grace oh nothing was going to stop me then church had a different meaning to it blasphemous name each one of these ages had that rock confession now my thing is this i told you and i've said this and i know i'm talking and i could be i could i feel like preaching but i'm talking and but i want you to understand cause i really want you to understand we cannot stay here you understand me wherever you are spiritually you cannot stay there and expect to make a rapture you understand me now we know what gets god's attention it's when you cry out brother branham said there's no other way to bring a birth right he said it doesn't it doesn't matter if you you you you you're being born in a decorated hospital room it could be pink or blue every birth is a mess and people don't want the mess but let me tell you if you're ashamed like one brother says brother you know i want the law but maybe i'll rent me a hotel room and we'll go there and maybe god give me the hotel he said uh-uh god can give you the holy ghost right now you mean right here right now if god can go to you know a prostitute place or wherever look through the scripture anywhere you can get god you don't have to be in a church building you can be home in a closet wherever god will give you the holy ghost if you really want it but the thing uh isn't about it is that when the change comes you must believe that that is to change because as soon as you move out from that anointing the devil gonna tell you you didn't get nothing he strips you and you will allow him to strip you with his words my point is how would he ever know what you got because he can't go there he can't go there if he can come behind the blood he's then your brother so how he gonna tell you what you didn't get when it's veiled to him you can't see he can't see what's in your heart he can't see it but understand what was happening now we're moving from glory to glory and all of us want to be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye it's coming but we're now in the process of moving up that ladder walking like enoch y'all hear me walking like enoch the bible never brings out enoch's failures and thoughts but you better believe he was a man hallelujah but he walked with god and the bible said if you walk in the light as he is in the light you have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses you from all of your unrighteousness so as you walk in the light you might have failures and thoughts but that blood is there washing cleansing you every step of the way hallelujah thank you jesus he said then this is what he said because i want you to understand by god's grace we're moving into an area that a lot of people are not understanding they can't see it and it's okay it's meant for those who can't see the point is is that this is we're cloak the time of uh we're closing in on this rapture on this trial on this translation it's really getting closer much closer than you think hallelujah but brother branham goes on and says the saints are sleeping waiting waiting waiting waiting see until this age been waiting for this age do you really think that god is going to rapture a church that's living in the glare of another age pentecostal age is over we can't live in that age we go beyond that then if we're going beyond that what are we looking for we're looking for the image we're looking for the very image and likeness of god to be formed into us that's why brother said we've we've had all of that we've had the singing we've had the shouting we had the dancing and we still got some of it right but that ain't it he said they do stuff like that at the football games yeah that ain't it it's all good what we experienced the other night there in service i really enjoyed myself that that ain't it that ain't all of it it's good to be able to do those things but that ain't that's not it there's a life that god want to see in us and it must be that is the token that is the token people it is the life of christ in us glory to god he said but soon the holy ghost being poured out from christ will come and will seal up the church whoo he said it's coming i know a lot of people ain't looking for nothing but it's coming right then the church then that's why i said it's coming because he said then the church will be raptured it'll be a complete unit of god hallelujah a bride for christ who will be the head of all things amen huh it's coming but we're pressing as it's pressing we'll meet each other right that's the way our wedding is we meet each other overcomers right to get the better of a struggle you got to get the best of this struggle or conflict it means to conquer it means to defeat hallelujah he overcame the enemy what was it because you were in a battle and we know we're going to have battles hallelujah that's why we're called soldiers that's why paul said put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil these tricks and things that he's putting before us he said listen but and a survival is one that just i put this way endure it's like a man stranded out on an island and you know you somebody find you and you just a few breaths from death but a conqueror if he conquered the island you'll find him but he's got his campfire and his meat on the fire right because he's conquered it hallelujah like i said of some things i've already said but when it comes to the power of god we must learn this bible is the power it's god written and jesus didn't pull out a wand or he didn't pull out nothing he said well i tell you what you know he didn't go through all of this stuff and you know thus said the lord no he said it is written how simple can you get it how simple can any of us get it it's written and if we could take it within our hearts like that people of god do you know the victory that we'll have the struggles you have to go because when you resist the devil the devil will flee from you that's about y'all believe that i believe that he said listen yet the father could have spoke anything through him but he never used it he used the father's written word and he never used his power but he used god's word and said it is written you understand me he didn't feel no swelling of the holy ghost coming up in him he just spoke it it is written why because the word is life it cannot be defeated it cannot be conquered it cannot be contained hallelujah that's what makes us different from the oneness the oneness believed that god is like on your finger that's impossible you can't put god in a box hallelujah he cannot be contained even though the fullness of the godhead bodily was in him that means the very essence was god of all god was in him but still god was everywhere can you imagine space and time god created that and our little p brains cannot even understand space and time that's what gets me about scientists they think they dig they deep deep deep deep because they understand space and times and quantum theories and all of that and they don't forget they who who made it my brother branham said it like this it's the truth they think they know up and they know down he said but who's to say what's up and what's down everything is in space so your up could be down and your down could be up right only god knows what's up and down it is true and we look at this and we say oh brother brooks what's wrong with you you know what let me say like this people of god we must focus our mind on the rapture we must focus our mind on on translation right even the animals knows when it's time to mate is that right i mean the trout would go all the way upstream knowing that once you get up there he's gonna they're gonna have some the sperm thing on and he gonna die he knows it but there's nothing that can stop him from going upstream rainbow trout is that what you are nothing going to stop you right right amen it's going to be tough it's going to be hard but it's in you you're a conqueror hallelujah amen i can be identified with this message you know people have a hard time when brother branham talk about squirrels and all of that if you see the way i'm spelling squirrels up here and you're like brother you need to go back to school i'm really seeing the thing like that ain't right but anyhow if you understood when brother brown preached and he talked about squirrels people said well i don't believe i believe it like i was saying this morning do y'all realize there was an ice storm coming here during the new new years they expected snow and ice guess what somebody prayed i was one of them i wanted to have church it missed us do you think that was coincidental oh no i i know don't y'all some of the ones the old saints i say oh those who were with me when i first came how many times we prayed storms away from this place and even the the news people said we don't know what happened hey but here at higher ground we know god we prayed we spoke it it went hallelujah little fishy how many of y'all believe that a dead fish raised back to death life and if god does that for a fish what about you and i do you don't you understand in his image and his likeness god cares more for you than he does the sparrow that's what he said he said listen i feed the sparrow and i clothe the field with flowers and don't you think i'll clothe you and don't you think i'll feed you and don't but you know what let me tell you something i can boast on him a little bit since this coronavirus uh cobic came you know you know how so many people have been out of jobs things have been happening financial but let me tell you like this in a nutshell god has never left himself without a witness i am a man to say that god knows how to take care of me [Laughter] amen times i said the devil tried to make you worry oh but how this is going to happen all of a sudden something come in from somewhere people you have no idea but i've even had people you've been on my heart brother brooks call me that's what i'm talking about you talk to god and god but god will fix it for you you don't have to feel it speak it is this is elementary i know but i'm i'm bringing us up to something brother battle was praying with the people he says i'm gonna put the right words in your mouth he started praying i'm gonna i'm gonna put the right words in your mouth i'm gonna tell you what to say to get the results when i read that i'm like oh that's pretty oh yes i'm gonna put the right words in your mouth to get the right results and all he did was pray a prayer of faith he said everything in a positive way and ended up with jesus christ and it happened in closing and the word will defeat the devil anywhere anytime under any condition hallelujah i don't i've told you folks we're at that place where samson was you got to realize you defeated and without god coming down to do something special for you amen you're a failure ha we're at a place we should be on fire fire but the philistines those demons has affected us in one way or another and if we don't cry out oh lord once more people say you crazy brother yes maybe i am but i know one thing i know one thing just by you know your body language tells everything you you speak with your body you know nobody goes away do you have joy in your life your body tells you know when you you know you see people that listen you the crossing of your legs the crossing of your arms all of those things you shutting god out and don't even realize it you're speaking you're speaking things and don't realize you you you your disposition is giving you a way you might be hearing here but you're not making it it's not making it here because when it makes here everything comes alive it's like turning on the light it's true you you go ask anybody who knows how to read bodies that's how some people you know that's why some people they can work at a bank and they can tell a crook before he comes in the door just by the way he walks they know the body language he may he may be in a business suit and if that person understand people and the way they talk with their body it gives them away the shifting of the everything plays a part in reading but anyway let's move on but jesus proved it when he defeated the devil the devil not using his power but just use just but just on the word of the father it is written it is written now when satan comes into you or trying to come to you you must remind him you are a super church you are the blood of jesus christ by the spirit you are undefeated invincible untouchable and nothing he can do like paul said can separate me from the love of god it's not my works he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it don't don't think god gonna fail you he cannot fail you and god doesn't change his mind he's perfect when it comes to choosing you god doesn't change his mind not about you when he was on the cross you were on his mind way before you got here long before you got here he saw you hallelujah now coming down to close what is he doing now he changed his mask william branham is gone thank god for the man i i i longed to see him in that resurrection but when he changed his mask he moved into what we call the bride form the bride age the bride of jesus christ and right now each one of us if you have the holy ghost each one of us is wearing we are the mask of god we are that that being that's veiling god is that right know ye not that you are the temple of god hallelujah but you understand when he changes his mask he never changes his character he never changes his nature whatever he was yesterday he is today that's why you that's how you know when you got it because whatever he was doing yesterday he's doing it today right we are invincible whatever he's still healing the sick he's still raising the dead he's still loving the unlovable hallelujah and you know what jesus still witnessing he went all out of his way to meet a woman at the well right he witnessed to all of his disciples he didn't send nobody there to them he came by john peter james all of them he himself drew them by his word come follow me he did it yesterday he's doing it today right so let's move on we're looking at something that's real and like i said i've seen every kind of religion i'm closing now i've seen every kind of religion there there is onward christian soldier marching as the war letting god letting go and letting god uh change us from glory to glory to glory to glory how do you know when there's ever human effort when there's ever human effort you'll find yourself falling backwards but when god changes it it's a real change that's what james says james said that we're drawn away with our own lust and entice right but when god takes away the lust enticed he takes away the thing the darkness in you that brings the lust and entice and when he takes that away from you like i was telling somebody i used to love to drink when i was young you know what i mean and and and perhaps i know it was a habit but i'll say it like this when god took it away he took it away i can drink real wine and never have a desire to drink it otherwise other than in communion i don't drink that when i say oh my goodness i'm i shouldn't have done that i'm a recovering alcoholic no i'm not a recovering alcoholic i never was a recovering alcoholic god delivered and when god delivered you can drink as much wine as you want to y'all understand me and never be a alcoholic he takes the alcoholic spirit out of you right so when it comes to communion you know people say well you know i can't take communion if it's real wine i can't do it because i used to be an alcoholic you haven't been delivered yet right i can go around well i never was a smoker i hated cigarettes anyway you know and stuff like that i i don't even know why people do it it's so gross but nevertheless you know that was one thing i know well you know when i go back round somebody name you hear that i remember being in in in um one thing about south america and the islands y'all think they play the music loud here it's on a different scale your house shakes your house dance your bed rocks it is so loud you think to yourself i'm gonna lose my hearing you can't even think i'm i'm laughing but i'm telling you it's the truth it's what i experienced and that's one of those things i have to be well prepared for when i go to those islands or go to uh or south america because i know they play their music they got drum decibels that you where it's against the law to play to take it to in this america and you don't if you not holy ghost field it's going to overtake you the next thing you'll do you'll see your mind and you yourself and your mind moving to the beat i'm telling you it's just that bad you have no control of it it will control you right but what i'm trying to say is you know there's not been a time i've ever gone and i want to go out there and just move why because god took it out of me he took it out of me and i'm saying when this is what we want we don't want a patched up job we want god to take all the darkness out of us and when he does fill us with his light don't leave us with an empty space but fill us with all of his life let's stand i i don't know whether all i know is i just know what he's doing in me he's changing me like the scripture says from glory to glory and i feel real good tonight in spite of having a rough sleep last night i feel real good and i know that the way i feel is is supernatural it ain't from the coffee but it's from god and i want to see everybody happy i was telling the church in iowa city we should never leave church safe that's that's that's it would be a disrespectful thing to be in the presence of the lord and then leave out of his presence saying i can't explain it it's it's degrading you mean to tell me you come to church and you leave in church you you're so unhappy you don't even know what to do and i think to myself lord that's why i said i'm going to be trying out my best to preach on a positive note we all get beat up during the daytime and every one of us know our shortcomings and our sins i'm going to call it out when god tells me but i want to bring something that's going to encourage you to to understand it is the goodness of god that should lead men unto repentance because i think about if i'm preaching on you and i'm really hard with it and you got a stubborn spirit i'm making you worse but maybe i can put some love in it some honey in the rock hallelujah and we can have some good fellowship around jesus if we can get people to the place that they will stop allowing the devil to condemn them we'll be all right because let's let me tell you something he works really hard on you before you come to church so he can condemn you so that when you could get in church you can't worship he imprisoned you by your own feelings and your shortcomings you got to understand god don't just run to the altar every time you fail he the bible said he shed his blood once and for all once involved i don't know if there's somebody that desired prayer would be more than happy to pray for you i want you to always pray for me i need your prayer all the time if you think you're going through something think about me being the pastor and every time a demon is cast out of you i he come by my house that's why sometimes i know what your failures are i know what your shortcomings are because i know what and and it's so amazing you get prayer and the devil is cast out and you don't even know he's gone some people don't even know he's gone because they're going by their feelings you can't go by your feelings faith is what makes him gone you understand me when the word of god is preached when the word of god has prayed over you at that moment in time if you really are a believer satan just left he has to and you got to believe he's gone because if he doesn't he's coming back and bringing his buddies with him now the stronghold is stronger than it was the last time because you're basing your victory upon your feelings and your feelings will always deceive you you love the lord in moments like these in moments like i'll sing i lived up [Music] ah [Music] uh is [Music] oh i love you [Music] is [Music] oh ah lord [Music] peace [Music] me through the storms you i am [Music] so covered [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] i'm sicker in you i find peace [Music] when my faith is [Music] is [Music] the peace [Music] you
