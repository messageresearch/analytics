everybody here i have an uh request for sister in ohio her name is kiki and we can pray again um she's been diagnosed with cancer she's now talking taking excuse me uh radiation i talked with her just briefly before service and um so i'll be talking with her tomorrow as well we're going to pray for her again i know god has something in store for her uh i i believe in connections you know sometimes we don't understand why we're connected with people and why strangers or somebody comes into your life but there's always a purpose for it and uh if we could recognize that it's just not by coincidence but that god is doing something i believe we can get more things done for god sometimes we allow things to slip out of our reach because we are not spiritual or we're not in the mind or the frame mind to know that god does nothing by mistake and uh we're trusting that god uh has something great for our sister uh she could be that last siege you never know but i don't believe that anything happens by coincidence god always give us a way of escape so let's pray for her once again heavenly father we come before you lord and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us lord you have truly been better to us than we've been to ourselves we pray for kiki even though we never met her before we just know lord god that there's something in the air there's something that you want to do or say to her and i pray father god that you would give her an open heart and mind to receive your word and lord god your future that you have for her bless her now and we pray and we bind the spirit of cancer we bind the spirit of death in the name of jesus christ and we speak life and liberty on her behalf in jesus christ's name we pray amen as we turn to the scripture glad to see the didier family is good and uh we thank god for everybody you love the lord the message in itself may seem really simple but it's powerful and uh the lord just spoke something to my heart if we could get the people to see it if revelation can be quicken you tonight on what is being said tonight i believe we'll have a real revival in this church i know we will first john 5 beginning at the fourth and fifth verse this is just the foundation of what i have in store for sunday should the lord tarry and allow us i hope the church is full because i really believe that what i am going to speak will is of the lord and is special i had a wonderful uh fellowship with him for those 10 days and i did not come back disappointed not to speak up but i thank god for his lessons first john 5. we're going to read the fourth and fifth verse in the first john and then we're going to read the 15th and 16th verse of the same chapter chapter 5 chapter 5 one of the things that i was listening to over and over again is faith and it became such a revelation to me that i know that i'll never be the same that particular message uh for whatsoever is born of god overcoming the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god 15 the 16th verse that what that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life but god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life one more scripture please philippians the first chapter we'll read the 29th through the 30th philippians first chapter 29-30. thank god for his grace and his mercy thank god for being here 29th and the 30th verse for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which he saw in me and now here to be in me let us pray father god we come before you lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for our understanding and enlightenment and what you have done for us and will do for us bless the servants in a special way we ask these things in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated you know sometimes we really do think we have faith sometimes we think that how can they say it no unbelief ever feel traitor surroundings but the very thought that god began to deal with dealing with me was only believe sometimes we we think with our head and not with our hearts and believing god is not with your head believing god is with your heart the subject tonight would be the strength of the christian is the faith to believe and brother adam when he was here he taught us we used to sing all that all the time only believe only believe but only believe what i remember talking to one of my children and i was giving them advice and uh this particular one came to me said daddy you know god is right yes and i'm like he's always right we're the ones that's wrong and i think once we get that in our head that he's always right we're wrong we'll find out that we need something more than the figment of our imagination we need something that can anchor us the bible say we must believe that he is god he that cometh to god must believe that he is god and that he is a reward of those that diligently seek him amen faith in itself is not mind over matter uh you can work your mind all day trying to have faith and it'll never happen because faith and the kind i'm speaking of is only given by god it's something that is quicken to you the kind of faith that abraham had was to call those things that be not as though they were to look at something and the thing that you're looking at is declaring something else but faith is the thing that operates the thing that is lying understand every lie is a demon every lie is a devil and the bible says i mean why would you say that because the bible says that satan is the father of lies so every lie is brought to you by one of his influenced ants or demons and so that's why we the bible said that god cannot lie there is no darkness in it he can't lie so to bring it down to where i'm going all of this word is true the bible says in the beginning of the word the word was with god and the word was god and i'll say it like this the word is god god cannot change but god needs someone to believe that he is god amen you know sometimes when we suffer we fail to see that he's still god but understand faith will always challenge you excuse me and faith will challenge you in in the in ways that you least expect it hard times and trials and tribulations will come upon you right the bible said many are the affliction of the righteous but god delivered them out of them all god you don't deliver yourself it's god's deliverance amen and we must understand that faith cannot be conquered oh faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is a victory that overcomes the world what does it do faith what to say what is to conquer and victory is the same to confidently need to beat down [Music] it means that you have overcome [Music] the bible says you must first believe that he is all right because the bible says without faith is it impossible for him uh with our faith to please him and he used one excuse me 11 13 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen we hear that all the time forbidden elves obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear in other words that you must first believe in we know this is here because we have when he says [Music] jesus amen because he is [Applause] amen he is superior he's the only authority amen and this is my brother taught us that before satan can bring the tribe to you he first must go by god all right and every trial that we have is a test of your faith y'all understand me whether you're going to continue to believe or not listen it's good to believe god when everything is because those trials are difficult and hard doesn't mean that god ever got one moment of weakness in him god is not a man amen he cannot and the bible tells us and guess what it came to pass because in the old testament when jesus died and went into hell and he he rose captivity uh leaving the captivity captain he gave gifts unto men the very thing that has a captive jesus captured that enemy right now is still imprisoned by the word of god let me ask you a question if satan was stripped of all his powers how come we feel like satan has power oh that devil is a powerful devil only a devil is powerful when you give that power to the devil he has nothing he defeated they're already defeated but you see in our minds we've allowed hollywood and all of these things of this earth to make us feel like satan has power the devil will show you vampires and witches and all of these wicked things that oh they got all these powers what power when you understand your position because the bible said all power in heaven and earth is given unto jesus and all that was in christ he poured it into his bride hallelujah so what are you saying i'm saying amen stop giving the devil power if jesus declared that all power in heaven and earth is given unto him that means he still have it and we must stop in our minds saying we believe when we don't when we give satan power oh that demon you see that's the thing that's what's wrong with the pentecostal minds that's why they say oh i fought with that demon all night why why would you fight with a demon all he's a lie he's a liar is that right when jesus told that epilepsy spirit come out of him or come out what happened he threw that guy all around before he came out he's the devil is a lie he's he's a y'all y'all know what a drama queen is he's a drama queen he loved to throw out the drama and that is to scare you it's to frighten your flesh as though he's got power hey jesus didn't move he spoke it and the devil knew he had to leave but we have the pentecostal yeah i'm not trying to crush anybody but we have the pentecostal way of doing things and brother adam said when you begin to scream and holler he said you know what that dude does it weakens your faith just speak the word you don't believe me you try it come out devil he ain't coming come out devil you think you're getting stronger you think the loudness of your voice only faith operates the word of god see so we we've got to get away from that and began to learn how to speak the word with authority that was the difference with jesus and all of the pharisees and sadducees they had systematic ways of doing things and jesus had a way of doing things and that was speaking the word of god we got to believe people we can't go on like this and we really want a revival we've got to go back to believing the word of god forget all of these intellectual ways of thinking that's what has happened to the message we've had so many intellectual message preachers till they've literally took the power of god out of the word right you can't learn how to do you know how could i say it like this we're not the catholic church teaching you how to exercise or exercise however they pronounce that word we're not here to show you how to do it sprinkle a little water here no sir by the commandment of the word it must be done don't back off of it because if you are inspired to speak it god is there to back it up every bit of it listen when he says what god church what got god church in trouble he said that's what got god tru god church and trouble is too many educated preachers without being born of the spirit come on that's the truth that's why they so afraid of devils because they're alive themselves the only commission god commissioned was those a man who had the holy ghost and when he commissioned them they didn't have it but he made sure they got it right men and women like to listen to intellectual speeches instead of preaching the word preaching the power and the resurrection of jesus christ that's what got us in trouble today we don't need any more high schools and education from preachers we need god call men that's filled with the holy spirit and not some man-made theology of some denomination we need god called men people who are not afraid to say god says or the word says you know to address devils right listen let me say it like this every aspect of the devil is a lie let me show you something so if you got a problem you can you can rectify it by believing the word the bible says with his stripes we are healed brother said i can't heal nobody because he healed us 2 000 years ago but you see if you don't believe it the devil will give you all the lying vanities he'd give you stuff for you it doesn't mean you won't be afflicted but the bible said god will deliver us out of them all it doesn't mean troubles don't come but the word is greater than the trouble he will deliver you out of them all but what we must believe the word says with his stripes we were healed already brother couldn't give him faith it was something that only the holy spirit could quicken to them and once they were quickened it was done what i don't care if it was cancer and the foster stage four cancer he said if you don't get help if you don't believe right because the angel told him whoever you get to believe if you could only get them to believe they'll be delivered so brother adam couldn't do nothing but he could only only the only thing he could do was preach the word and pray that the anointing would allow would quicken them to believe what he was saying was truth how in the world can a blind man see until he believed that he was healed and when he believed that he he was healed hallelujah his eyes had to obey hello what about a man who couldn't who couldn't hear how did he get faith god made it possible for him to see somebody else who was healed and the first the dumb man whether i don't even know how god but i know one thing for certain god has a way of opening a man eyes and ears even if they can't see nor hear his presence make them know that something supernatural is happening hallelujah is that all right think about it and when we see these things we must understand that god did it nobody but god he's the healer medicines is fine doctors are fine but at the end of the day god is the healer right he said what is it her sister broke through that place of the things in other words brother graham said there was a sister out there in the audience who was healed and this sister said wait a minute i know this sister he called her name out he she said i know the sister and i know what he said is true now that was enough to break her into that atmosphere to make her believe that this man is true and the word he's speaking is truth is that right that's what jesus said my word they are truth and they are life everything outside of this is a lie lying vanities y'all understand me lying vanities that was the way jesus could see it he saw everything that was contrary to his word as a lie and therefore he knew he was truth and the truth will always prevail over a lie y'all hear me what is it her sister broke through this place of things of the world see he says listen things of the world don't only mean smoking and drinking and show and running around right it means unbelief things of the world it means unbelief so you got to get rid of the things of the world you got to get rid of the unbelief she broke through all of that till she found that her faith overcomes she said if god can do that for that white man god can do that for me a colored woman god did it and god will do it every time that our faith overcomes doubt help us jesus every time our faith overcome doubt he says no matter how bad it is no matter how bad it is i believe i believe lord i believe no matter how bad i mean let me read that again cause that's really good that's good to me what is it hers her sister broke through that place of the things of the world things of the world don't only mean a smoking and a drinking and a showy uh showing or running it means unbelief she broke through it all of that till she found that her faith overcomes and she says now let me tell you what was the problem with her she had a sister i think it was in alabama who was mentally ill been in the hospital 10 years busting her head up against the wall she's so insane but what she was saying if god can do that for that person he can do it for me see that's that's why they're laying in the scripture blind by the males right the woman who was a prostitute amen the lame walking the dumb talking the eyes of the blind seeing the dead rays and this is our attitude if god can do it then he can do it now why because he's the same yesterday today and forever you got to believe that he doesn't diminish in his power and his authority he is god and he that cometh to god must believe that he is god and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him hallelujah god doesn't age he's eternal he doesn't get weak and fragile he's as strong as he ever was he doesn't even grow in strength he's always been omnipotent nothing can change him hallelujah first corinthians 15 49 says so because i want you to understand the only way that we are going to come into this image we must believe all of his word all believe it all it doesn't say figure it out it doesn't say process it in your mind you must believe it all he disbelieved one word you understand me and it got us in this condition but god is looking for a people who's going to what worship him in spirit and in truth and in order to worship in spirit and truth you must believe all the word you don't have to understand it because god called these ignorant unlearned dumb people like me amen but dumb enough amen to believe everything he said is true so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last man adam was made what a quickening spirit hallelujah howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterwards that which is spiritual and the first man of is of the earth earthly the second man is the lord from heaven think about things that you ask god for and i'm finna get to the last part as is the earthly such are they also that are earthly and as is the heavenly such are they also of the heavenly the first man of the earth earthly the second man is uh the lord from heaven but look what he says amen in the fourth 49th verse it says and as we have borne the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly and the only way that that can ever happen is that you must be born again hallelujah it takes a birth to bring forth the image of god and you must be born of god amen to bring forth the image like i said the earthly man can't produce heavenly things we're carnal but heavily heavily born again it brings forth something that we ourselves cannot produce and none of us can get credit for it it's not him that will it know he that run it but god who shows mercy like i said god will challenge you hallelujah god will challenge you every man every woman is challenged by god some way maybe i'm using the wrong word but let me say it like this amen challenges come and god allows them so when you talk about challenge you talk about to have confidence in the truth that's what it you you got to have confidence in the truth right if you're not certain you're going to fail but if you know that i can stand on this word and this word will never pass away heaven and earth will pass the grass will wither the flowers fade away but the word shall stand y'all hear what i'm saying it's not something you can get with your mind you got to say god quicken it to me if i don't understand what he's saying it's not that i don't believe it i believe it but it must become a revelation that is personally to you y'all understand me let me tell y'all something a lot of times we can be so legalistic with things and i myself sometimes i forget you know everybody don't have to shout everybody doesn't have to dance everybody don't have to run in you know we have these little things because we think shouting and dancing but you know that could be legalistic just as well as being sitting there not saying anything did you know that why it means that you feel like somebody's got to worship god like you everybody have a different revelation of god everybody let me prove it to you when jesus rose from the dead mary saw him as the gardener oh yeah on the road to emmaus he revealed himself as a stranger but after he revealed himself they knew he was alive huh he reveals himself in different ways to different people but the result is the same he's god he's still alive and a lot of time that's what's wrong with the people in the message we figured that our revelation got to be just like you know everybody got to have it just no no no the way he appears to you may he that's great but he may appear to me in a different way but the end result is jesus christ is alive and well you see thomas wasn't going to believe none of it so he had to reveal himself to thomas by way of touch and feelings you know how what i'm saying some people say well i got to feel him oh i got to feel that anointing you know let me cry sometime but because you're crying because you're feeling doesn't mean that's him but if you take his word he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you you have passed from death unto life because you got believed on me he didn't say fear me or taste me or drank me he said because you believed that i am the true son of god you have now passed from death and to life god help us all i believe we'll have a powerful church if we can get everybody to start really believing the word not with our head with our hearts standing on it like it's a matter of life and death to have confidence in the truth the existence or the ability of something although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so in other words maybe you don't have proof i know how some people are they say you know what i see everybody jumping and shouting or i see everybody running out i see everybody different but that doesn't mean one hill of beings because you can have all those uh uh uh that those are natural manifestations and still don't have god on the inside what are you talking about how do you think these people deceive folks on tv they they go to school they learn how to act oh the lord is in this place and then they start crying and the next move is give me your money they they go to school for that and god is not with that god is only with truth wherever the truth is wherever the spirit of the lord is there's liberty see all that drama and stuff that that the church brings and we've allowed a lot to slip in with us amen doesn't mean it's god we must learn how to believe the impossible i hope this is this is something i believe this is what god gave me this is the foundation of what i want before i preach what i want to preach on sunday but you got to believe you got to believe this word people the lord has taught me in the time in such a way i can't explain but let me tell you what what what i see here we fail to see the power of election sometimes we fail to see when god quickens something to you in the word what that really means god don't quicken everybody he just doesn't do it but he quickens himself to his people right remember let me you say what do you mean quicken he was on the road to emmaus they stopped they thought he was a stranger he went through the word of god he started with the prophet right and he worked his way all the way up what did brother branham do the same thing but some people can see who he is and some people cannot right so you say well what do you mean then they still was blinded don't you understand you could be looking right at a scripture and still can't see it because it's something that must be revealed it's something that must be quickened right and so you say what do you mean this is what you got to pray lord quicken your word to me give me the revealed understanding of what you're saying you may not even know how to read properly but you can look at that word and say god give me understanding and god will give you understanding he said if you ask of me a bread which is the bread or word for the word will i give you a serpent absolutely not to give you the truth to believe the impossible all things are possible to them that what believe that is the theme of the message hallelujah this bride must have the faith to look at somebody who's who's without our arm and believe that god can quicken that to them and that arm will code come come back you must believe that if god quickens you go pray now i'm going to tell you a testimony of a brother brother brown from florida he almost he he almost died his mother-in-law died i said he's so sick with the covet he can't hardly move he said i couldn't hardly get out of bed but his wife had ran to him and say she's gone she's dead she's not breathing her eyes are set and everything he climb out of the bed he crawled out of the bed he saw where his mom his gran his mother-in-law was dead and he says lord jesus whatever you do don't let him die like this don't let her die like this lord and i can't remember all the words verbatim but he said in the name of jesus and she went and she's living today don't tell me god ain't god yes sir and if you believe it why would he pray for a dead woman he believed god could bring him back and god did it he quickened that brother hallelujah god is still god no matter what the world believe be you know it's just a few of us left that's going to fully believe and i'm one of them i trust that you are too hallelujah yes lord true believers the word is the word of revelation faith is a revelation you know that the way he's described it you know you can't have it unless god reveal it did you know that the bible pronounced in this last days there will be men who have eyes to see and cannot see ears they hear and cannot hear naturally they see well but in this day god also have those people who are willing in their hearts and mind to see he said buy you some uh uh i i i saved that's it i'm stuttering buy some eyeshadow let me put something in your eye let me open your eyes and god did that by the quickening power of the holy spirit i'm not going to be long tonight i'm almost done but i just want to set a foundation so that you can understand that this faith that we're talking about if you can't grasp it you go to the one who can unveil it to you right that's where prayer come in at lord i'm struggling with this i need to have this revealed to me i need to have this you know i'm struggling and it's okay to struggle that means you're alive it's okay but then you've got to overcome the struggle faith overcomes the struggle it overcomes it it defeats it right it brings you to a place where you can't even explain it but you say god don't answer to my prayer i'm looking for god to do it i'm expectation for god to do it huh and he will do it can you imagine all that time abraham and sarah had to go with with all of the people criticism and laughter and mocking and and the more they say we're going to have a son or child they they look at them and laugh and say you're getting old you're wrinkled and you're humped back and everything else they said well we don't care what it looks like he promised it what you going to do if you should die we don't know when the lord coming you understand what i'm saying but you got to die in faith knowing that if i die i'm getting up what are you have you ever seen anybody get up most of us haven't but faith says it's possible for me and it will for me that's what the resurrection this is part of the gospel we believe him when he said he shall call and we'll get up yeah that ain't just listen you die in faith with the fact that you know that jesus christ is the resurrection and the life what is faith faith is something that that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be we have believed we've been believing from our children and they're coming in one by one and i believe with all my heart i'm gonna see everyone come in oh yeah it's been long time coming but it's happening hallelujah just wait wait wait on the lord is that right and the bible said he shall renew your strength he'll renew it he'll make something happen here it would quicken you well i could tell you what when jesus started healing in in jerusalem and healing and capernaum and healing all in all you know all they had to do was see one miracle can you imagine what those people must have felt like they thought they really had faith and then here was this man being lowered down out of the man and tearing up the man house jesus was on the inside crippled man couldn't get in himself and his friends got him up on top of the roof tore the man roof up to put that crippled man down in there right jesus didn't look up and says what kind of thing is this he didn't criticize him he complimented them what great faith y'all understand me what i'm saying is this faith has no barriers none whatsoever faith is a revelation of the will of god and so they laid that man down and jesus says rise up and walk huh this man gets up and start dancing out and guess what people criticized the supernatural jesus didn't come out trying to boast but the point is he knew where the healing came from he said i can do nothing except the father show me that's the way we've got to be and every bit of this honor that god give we must give that honor back we must if we truly believe hallelujah and the revelation is the only thing that revelation of the word what is this revelation jesus said upon this rock i build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it do y'all believe that you're the church then what does the gates of hell it can't prevail like i can't i'm gonna say it again you give him power he has none hallelujah but if you can believe the word is still a healer if you believe the word is still a deliverer if you believe the word is still amen everything he's ever been and more oh you got victory now hallelujah faith is a revelation because faith has hasn't has has been revealed to you listen able by faith when god tells you something and show you something no devil in hell can stop it absolutely not absolutely not let me put something before you here see to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that's the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith y'all thought it was going to be something else right for the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because there's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could that could call anything contrary to what has been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now faith that that what god what faith is is a revelation that god see the church is built upon the revelation the whole entire body now um real faith knows no defeat real faith and god quickens it to you real faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated even death itself can't defeat it can you see where our sister just went rebecca i want to pray for her it knows no defeat trials knows defeat no defeat but faith knows no defeat excuse me trials no defeat but faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated and it is the only way that you can please god for without faith it is impossible to please god hmm huh but while to be the true believer is the revelation of god being revealed in the age we're living in he said my words are spirit and life jesus said that again right the word is listen the bible said bless and curse not you can't curse nobody and really believe the word and many times we want to do that uh we get offended you say well and we use the word you better not touch not the anointing of the lord now what are you thinking when you say that what are you thinking when you say that you're literally thinking god gonna get you see but that ain't the way we're supposed to do it god revenges vengeance is of the lord not of us god's going to do his part anyhow but we don't call him on the scene to revenge you understand me that's not the way it is the bible said bless those that curse you be good to those that despitefully use you oh god knocking on our door i know it but you see we're talking about making a rapture we're talking about being the full word and it comes to remember i read the scripture suffering those who suffer in the flesh have ceased from sin because your flesh want to do something but you suffer because you bind your flesh and your soul is free right oh it's true people say well you don't know i'm gonna lay down my religion boy you keep that up you ain't got none if you can lay it down it ain't real if you can put it beside you or put it behind you it's not real people what you must have is one that will never leave you nor forsake you he's gonna be there always in times of trouble in times of joy and times those places where you do he's going to be there don't you think god understand have any of us suffer like he has none of us has been crucified none of us have been nailed to the cross none of us been spit in the face none of us had put a thorn of crown none of us have been stripped naked that's one of the most humiliating things that you could do to a man strip him naked and put him on the pole and he told his disciples if i be lifted up i would draw all men into me he was stripped naked so that we could be clothed by the word of god i think about him i'm telling you i think about the lord and the things that he's suffering i'm like i'm not even a drop in a bucket compared to what he's had to go through but he did it for all of us people it makes me want to cry right now because i i could feel i could see you know you see things like you've never seen before and you think lord what have i been doing all these years ah he said my word of spirit and life jesus says again the word is a seed that is a sore soul we know that's truth it's god in word form and can only be interpreted by himself the human mind is not incapable to interpret the mind of god you understand me but yet the word of god says let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus and the only way that could ever happen is by revelation hallelujah how can this little infinite this excuse me this little finite mind interpret the infinite mind when we can eat we can't even interpret one another's mind and you notice he is the only one can interpret it he interprets it to whom he will it didn't say mortal mortals of old as they strolled across the earth in sandra times in diverse manners it's a god in some hundred times and divers manners revealed himself to his prophets i mean the prophet had to get the revelation it wasn't his own thoughts it wasn't his own words it was god revealing himself to the prophet and even the prophet's word spoken cannot be just taken literally it has to be revealed well let's put it this way so you better understand me it must be taken literally before god can reveal it you understand me whatever he says it's an amen but it takes god to reveal to you what he said what are you talking about i mean take acts 2 38 versus matthew 28 19. you've got to believe matthew 28 19 first then acts 2 38 can be revealed it's no contradiction it's a revelation and god said it in the scripture just like that so he could reveal it to his own but to some it's a stumbling block some will say well i'd rather believe what jesus said than what peter said it's because they don't understand the word peter wasn't preaching his own word he was repeating he was preaching the revealed word of matthew 28 19. let me move on you understand me but you got to believe watch the word of the prophet and this is what we must do we know we we we understand just like i was seeing something let me say it like this so you better understand we're dealing with politics we're not dealing with politics but our whole world is political insane right now you've got a liberal side you've got a conservative side now we must come to think now what did god say about these things what is he saying about this that's happening now he said what's going to happen he tells us that the church and state will reunite again okay so what is the devil doing he's playing the liberal side he's playing the insane side and he's looking up at the you better understand the trap because if you get so involved in this you're going to be caught in a well you better understand this is the world's affairs and not ours now the law revealed this to me so you've got to understand that this conservative side is going to be so right watch it move because it's going to move you all think the liver is going to stay like it no no no it's going to move and god is going to move this thing into a a place where everything is going to look so right because everything else has been so wrong and christians going to be so happy because now we've got a government that stands for morals but let me tell you something it's not even the governor's government business to project morals on us right in one way the liberals are right because they're saying it's my business to live the way i want to guess what that's god's way he doesn't stop our will y'all understand me but he does not enforce law because the law in itself amen is legalistic and it's not spirit you understand me it will force the issue oh people you better hear what i'm saying and you get caught in that web you're gonna be in trouble so what do you do in a situation like this you pray lord not my will but thine will be done i'm not only i'm standing for morality but it's not the government it's the church that's supposed to it's the born it's the spirit of god that brings you into the right kinds of morals right because understand you can be morally clean and still be lost hallelujah but you see it takes a born-again experience but the devil is going to bring all this together and make everything look good and when they say peace then sudden destruction will come don't you see all of this confusion everything that's going on it's the stage of setting up the stage and they're not going to understand why the bride will say no to it when it looks so right you know why we've got a prophet we've got a prophet and you better understand these people don't understand what they're doing but they're still ordained to do what they're doing what you say when god told elijah said tell ahab the dog is gonna lick up your blood right and and and then you had old false prophet by the name of zedekiah he said go up we can take our ai we're gone up but there was another prophet who understood and had the revelation of what elijah said and elijah had already prophesied that ahab was going to be killed hello so they call in 400 prophets and all of them amen was now deceived by a lying spirit because the lying spirit said came before god said i'll get them to believe the lie hello oh we'll all be one we'll get over it we're going to be victorious and we'll get everything back like this and and and and makaya said huh i'm a false prophet if that happens because i saw israel scattered like this like sheep i saw him being defeated and that old false prophet slapped him and says where did the spirit of the lord go when it left me and um mckay said well you go head on i'm a false prophet if you come back hey he was killed in the is that right that's the scripture why it looked good that the church amen can overtake everything go on up we can take it you can't take nothing god is the power of his church and the power of his church is by his word and as long as you keep your eyes on what the prophet god has said is coming in this hour and will come forth in this hour you'll be free but when you get entangled that's why i said it messing with all of our minds has done that and doing that and we'll do it if we allow them to but you see the bride keeps our eyes on jesus hallelujah israel's scattered like sheep if you come back i'm a false prophet the words of elijah was what quickened to makaya he knew and you know ahab never liked him every time he come and prophesied is doom and gloom and that's what's happening the true ministers of god there's preaching doom and gloom this ain't going to get no better it's going to get worse you got to understand the mark of the beast is moving right now in a systematic and if you don't understand that they meant the word of god you got to believe it right now the bride is making herself ready she's preparing because she see the signs and saying and it was not always a sign but the word says we're looking for the coming of the lord he's coming hallelujah and you know what the bible said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow brother sisters this is the hour and the time of the calling out of babylon the evening light are here walk in the light while it is light notice the believer saw the word manifested and believed it jesus said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow is that right my word my signs of the age a false one they'll not follow we see the sign we understand that the mastery of the prophet was the last sign to the gentile age but what are we doing about it see faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil and you know what i've been guilty as soon as something go bad i say oh it's getting worse what are you talking about nothing gets worse to the believer is that right is that what he taught us he said when you see it look like it's getting worse that means it's getting better see we don't say it's getting worse oh when it goes look like it's getting worse we say oh it's getting better and there's an angel there watching your words to bring those things to pass oh jesus can i just a few more minutes i've said it not long well that's long but anyway amen faith is a victory that overcomes every curse of the devil y'all hear what i'm saying every curse because a curse is a lie when god bless you when you become a christian you have no curses generational curses if the devil keeps telling you that it's a lie but if he can get you to believe that lie it becomes reality but once you refuse to lie amen you can go free hallelujah amen faith is a victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your creed not faith in some man but faith in jesus christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it is the victory say oh my arm is still crippled but faith is the victory i still feel sick but faith is a victory oh it overcomes the world when you can climb into god oh i like that sin when you can climb into god by prayer until you see the thing conquered until under you there is nothing that that can hurt you then you've overcome you hear what he said you got to climb into god by prayer hallelujah you overcome you've got 50 miles of elbow room you're selling free you who have been a drunkard and a slave to whiskey you will be the master over him then that's old devil of alcohol that make you drink he's your master now but when you get faith i don't mean make believe real faith he's your servant then you who can't lay down tobacco you women and men when it comes to place to where you can't get to that spot to where you have to overcome it by faith you're mastering it then a little woman excuse me that's sitting present now she has been at this altar time after time at the time a good woman but she started smoking a long time ago and she just couldn't overcome it and she has come up and i would pray for her and seem like she just couldn't overcome it the first thing you know i told told her i said there will be a danger down the road you see every time you believe a lie there's danger down the road she said brother branham i have tried i have begged you see just emotional fighting the air that won't do it any good and i i and i get down and pray with her and lay hands on her and she go back in a few days i'll meet her again just knock you down with cigarette smoke hand still brown now that was that was a strong demon of unbelief because demons are just unbelief demons they just demons there because you be unbelie you don't believe that's their stronghold their spirits now don't get me wrong but they're there and they're strong they're strong uh their the power in which they work by and work with is unbelief you understand me right so anyway strong and the prophet can pray and it won't move right one night down yonder she went to the doctor began to get sick withered away to just a a little spinal skin a spindly thing and the doctor looked into her and said cancer smoking cigarettes there she was laying there to die then she got down to business see a drowning man with reach for straw long as you can walk out of this church tonight know you can go to join church baptist or methodist as long as you can sit in the here and say well now i'm i'm a good person there's nothing wrong with me yeah you can you can't do nothing with you that's right but when you see your sins as god sees them in the light of his bible when you see you you'll repent or perish something will take place you'll get to business walk out here in a smothering around your heart amen uh the doctor back there with will maybe raise up and come up and look say it's a heart attack you'll go to business see you'll get to business that's when uh she had to get to business and the woman is sitting looking at me now brother robinson is back there and mr woods here brother was sitting here somewhere and i were going down hunting and i believe in somewhere in the truck and the holy spirit seemed to move move us up to go way up through the through the knobs to where she was and when i got there she had a dream and when the holy spirit came in the room and she got down to real business she never smoked a cigarette from then on she had gained many pounds of weight she has gained many pounds of weight and they can't find a trace of the cancer what is it it is faith that overcomes y'all understand overcoming that means you're in a battle you're struggling you're going through something but faith will overcome that you got to believe that it doesn't matter how much pain wrecked your body god said with his stripes we're healed oh it doesn't matter how it looks and then you got to believe that i'm not i'm not dying i'm here to live because i believe god has healed me not that will heal me he has healed me i'm not i'm not struggling with that see why didn't overcome when when i was praying for her there she was just flooding around but when the doctor said you got cancer and you're going to die huh she got to business that's the way it has to get when you when you get to business why wait that long why wait that long why not get down to business now put your faith in god what if the woman had had her faith in me it would fail because i'm a man but when you change when she changed her faith not in the branham tabernacle or william branham or any anyone else but place her faith in jesus christ then she got her faith she raised up above all the fears and doubts and got healed and god healed her see all she overcome faith is the victory that overcome and you must understand that the bride is an overcomer that means we're going to have battles we're going to have obstacles that means satan is going to put things in our way but guess what we'll hurdle every one of them hallelujah there's nothing he can do that can stop us why it's not us it's god in us it's the lord jesus that's what he does hallelujah you know god is real he's so real without him where would we be hallelujah luke 5 1-6 and i'm going to close on this i believe i've given enough to to help us out and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god she stood by the lake of ganaret and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermens were gone out of them and were washing their nets and he entered into one of the ships which was simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and thought the people out excuse me and he said then thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your net for a drought and simon answered and said until master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net and when they had done when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fish and their net break now only because he said at thy word look what he says you see because you got to understand that faith operates faith operates the word and what's the matter tonight with our faith we're afraid to let god take his his operating word his knife sharper than a two-edged sword and operate on us and tell us that our little uh fangdango humbungle around is wrong and we go to turn loose every shudder and sail towards god's eternal promise oh if we'll do that jesus will perform in operation upon our faith taking away all the doubt all the fears all the worries all the sin everything there is and when we when our faith is clearly operated on we can we we come out as a new creature we're different then we need an operation can you just trust jesus for the operation can you believe him can you say lord god at thy word at thy word as the disciples said in saint mark when they said we we've seen all in all night and have taken nothing nevertheless lord at thy word i'll let down my neck lord i am a fisherman you got to know that that's basically what simon was thinking i'm a fisherman i know the signs when the moon is just right i know when they're biting and and when they're not i know when they're in their schools and and when they're not not only that but i i've seen all night and and and here is a council of doctors here with me dr fishman and we know our trade and we will search this stream all night long and haven't taken another nothing but at thy word lord i'll let down the net see because the chief surgeon said so the chief doctor says so and they enclosed such a multitude of fish till their nests began to break why faith is the victory there might not have even been one fish in the water but when god had a promise had made a promise he created fish and put them there there may not have been a chance for you to live you may be dying with cancer you may be bound to a wheelchair you may be totally blind i don't know what your trouble is but if you'll take the cheap doctor's prescription whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it and believe that that faith will overcome any difficulty there is you may be so burdened with sin until your soul is as muddy as it can be you may have tried to get rid of that ill temper that slandering tongue that gossip of the telephone you might have tried every remedy that you know how but if you just let jesus come into you tonight he'll operate on your faith and give you a faith that will climb beyond anything that the world can produce why faith is the victory that overcometh the world how could you doubt when jesus christ the son of the living god is present here now his great holy spirit is in this building the word promise that's right lo i am with you i'm with you always even to the end of the world it was his promise by the lord god has to keep his word do you believe that when he promises he will do these things god is solemnly obligated to do such hallelujah he's god hallelujah in closing but before we pray i like to ask the question i'd like to ask if there's a man woman boy or girl that's in this building that would say by an uplifting hand lord i just seemingly can't overcome it seems like i know that i should do these things i know i shouldn't do this and that but i want you to operate on my faith right now after this message i want you to give me a complete check hallelujah over in operation on every little disease of my faith that would keep me from overcoming these things hold up your hand to him will you do it lord bless you place your full uh place you're full of hands put you just place your hands in his hands amen love the lord let's stand in and pray well ask sister rebecca to comment we know she's got a need and then if anybody else has a need you know god is god and i just believe in praying and believing that god will answer prayer father god we come before you lord jesus you know our sister condition you know the things that she's going through you know our brother didier and what he's going through lord we just pray father god that you hallelujah bring a complete healing in restoration oh god to our sister and lord may this be a speedy request oh god that she'll know that it's your hand and not mine nothing we can do lord but if we believe you said all things are possible to them that believe and father we trust you we believe you for this healing lord in jesus christ's name we thank you for her healing and victory in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen i was just in a place the other day and this lady was a denominational christian and she was just telling me about all the miraculous that she's seen seeing wounds open rooms healed instantly in the face i mean things that you think it belongs but listen you don't even have to be converted to have faith right it's a revelation it's something that god drops in your heart she was just telling me that and i just felt like wow i mean i'm praising god with her you know she didn't look like a christian but i thought to myself what does a christian look like but one thing for certain she had enough faith to see what she saw god don't play with that kind of thing and it just did something to my heart like lord it's been a long time since i've seen miracles i've seen him i'm a witness he's real but he's the same yesterday today in fact he's a god change is not hey i know god amen answers prayer he's answered many many of my prayers and i'm sure you can testify to the same thing he's not a god of imagination he's real and i know by his word he's healed us by his word he's delivered us by his word [Music] you know what i'm learning you ain't got to feel it you got to believe it because you feel it don't mean you you believe it you got to believe it so i pray for my brother elijah he knows what he need the elijah's overcomer elijah has overcome a lot of things and this is just the beginning satan places obstacles in his way but i've seen him get up hallelujah i've seen it i want that my brother to know that god is with him and i'm sure he knows that but i want him to know tonight that he just keep believing keep believing no matter what satan says how many times you fall come short has nothing to do with the promise has nothing to do with election y'all understand me nothing can change the election of god in you and your eyes see who gave you the sight right you say lord i have a hard time forgiving god is here tonight god can remedy that lord help my heart operate on my heart lord it's been broken and bruised but god still is a hero he is a deliverer and i believe brother you're getting your healing in the numbers right now you've had others to pray for you but it still takes your faith take your faith and unite it with others and you'll see such a wholeness in yourself lord right now i thank you right now for my brother hallelujah you are a liar satan we're not going to believe your lies no matter how many times you throw those lies in my mind i will reject him every time until i see the promise of god fulfilled in my life thank you jesus for the victory thank you jesus for the victory i'm receiving my victory tonight right now in jesus christ's name thank you your word says so that's what i'm counting on your word hallelujah the devil says well you don't have the holy ghost you know he's a liar if he tells you that you don't have it that means you got it hallelujah amen you just let him live in you he says lord not my mind i don't i don't need my mind i don't need directions of anything i just need you to direct me let the mind of christ be in you and his mind was to believe everything his father said he was directed by him right so if you allow god listen i'm telling you if the church to take a hold of this simple message that was preached tonight we would have a powerful revival in this church in no time and that's what i've been praying for when i was in my shut-in i cried out for every soul and i believe with all my heart god has granted him and all i got to do is continue to preach the word what he tells me to preach and things are going to change not by my power his power i know one thing i know if i don't know anything else i do know he heard my prayer yes sir god it's real amen are there any other special requests if not thank god for his grace such a lovely name the name of jesus hallelujah oh such a lovely lovely name i love you love him tonight yes sir such a lovely lovely the name [Music] you know pride is an evil thing try to keep you from victories and the lord says you know when we're full of pride it's just destruction is waiting i know that pride is a subtle thing it comes in such a way you know because we all want people to believe that we're more spiritual [Music] but one day we're going to get to a place where people doesn't it just don't matter [Music] it just doesn't matter it gets a place where you you you you you find yourself in a place where i don't know maybe i'm the only one that loves to be accepted but you know because people don't accept me it doesn't matter anymore i don't care you know what i'm saying it doesn't matter you're not taking my joy you're not stealing nothing from me because my joy comes from the lord and you got to get to a place where you god and church all by yourself that's right you say two or three yeah me and jesus you get to that place and you just you begin to love what god has made you maybe you're not what you think or what you want to be but you're so glad about what he's already done you know that the work that he's done in you is he's going to complete it that just does something to me because you know what i believe that my covenant with god and you supposed to believe that your covenant with god is unconditional and no weapon formed against you shepherds not one i don't care what it is it cannot will not prosper remember this the devil has no power the only power he has is what you give him not to a truly blood washed he cannot even come in and disturb your life without the permission that's how the shepherd watches over you love the lord i could keep preaching come brother pray for me that god will grant me the freedom and the liberty to minister the thoughts that he's given me for this coming sunday and i trust that our second service will be as full as our first i really believe that what i have to offer for those who have ears to hear will be a blessing to everybody the name of jesus [Music] oh the name of jesus [Music] oh [Music] holy oh your holy holy name the name of jesus [Music] is the name of jesus [Music] the name of jesus such [Music] is [Music] holy [Music] oh believe [Music] that all things are [Music] possible [Music] oh all things are possible lord i believe [Music] all things are [Music] possible lord i believe that all things are possible [Music] i received lord i received all things oh lord i received lord i received oh all things are possible [Music] lord i jesus is here yes jesus is here [Music] jesus all things are possible i know jesus [Music] jesus is here one more time jesus [Music] jesus i know jesus [Music] [Music] you
