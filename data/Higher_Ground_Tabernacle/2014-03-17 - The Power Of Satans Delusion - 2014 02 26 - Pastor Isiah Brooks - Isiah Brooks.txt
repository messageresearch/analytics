TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we stand we're just going to get right into the word of God ask as we stand that you turn with us to 2 Thessalonians love the Lord second Thessalonians read from the second chapter beginning at the ninth verse and we'll go to uh Isaiah 66 2 Thessalonians 9 at the 12th verse I'm sorry 2 Thessalonians 2 give me beginning at the ninth verse didn't sound right even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth and that's my theme because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they might that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness amen Isaiah 66 Isaiah 66 and4 I also would choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when I called none did answer when I spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in which I delighted not let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you Father for being good to us Lord we pray that you forgive us of all of our sins and our shortcomings Lord we just pray that you would cleanse us with your Holy Fire oh God make us ready Lord give us God God what we stand in need of to make a translation father and to all to you be all the glory Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen just to encourage you by the grace of God uh if you have a way of listening to the message uh this day the scripture is fulfilled I pray that you will allow or ask God to give you a full revelation of what is really being really taking place uh during that time uh I think a lot of times people uh basically uh saw uh different things but brother bradam was basically trying to bring us up uh into history bring us up into the day in which we were are living in and uh he in that scripture or in that uh this day the scripture is fulfilled uh we find out out that brother brandom approaches the uh uh the uh Podium and somehow his wife has given him a new Bible and the pages stick together and a priest basically uh tells him amen uh that God is getting ready to do something so here God speaks through him and the priest not even knowing what the prophet was going to preach uh had no idea basically what he was uh going to to do we find out also in that same tape there was a sister who was of the priest the priest's sister uh who were was there in the meeting uh spoke in tongues interpreted the exact thing that the priest that told brother Brandon so we we look at this and uh my subject on tonight would be the power of Satan's illusion and uh we realize amen that that where we are uh we're living in a time when uh people are in a delusion you know you can use the word illusion delusion because a delusion is a false belief or opinion now that's something that somebody really when they think they're right when they're wrong the Bible says that we're living in a day when the the ways of men they think that they're right uh see but there's only one way right and that's God's way when we speak of Illusion we speak of something that deceives by uh producing a false uh and misleading impression of reality something that produces in other words you you might even think you got evidence that you're right for an example when uh uh Janis and jambre threw down their rods and the Egyptians were at that point brought into an illusion and because they believe the illusion they came into a place of being delus deluded so we looked and we see by the grace of God Amen that you know they began to believe why should we follow Moses when we got janers and jambre and we find out that that's exactly what happened in our day and when brother Bon began to speak the message this day the scriptures fulfilled he was trying to indicate to the people the very thing can't you see what is taken place a priest hand me a Bible like a priest handed Jesus the Bible Jesus comes from this scripture that I'm coming out of but Jesus read the scripture where it was an accepted time but I'm reading the scripture where the Judgment of God is at hand so he was showing the Alpha and the Omega of the scripture that Jesus had read and understand amen it was still the Lord Jesus hiding behind human flesh and so we find out amen that we are living in a time and and this thing become h h h psychological because once a man believes something with in their mind it's so difficult for them to see anything else in other words they become blinded in their minds that's that's the age that we're living in the Bible said that uh in Revelations 3 that Leo deia would be blind now he's not speaking amen that she's naturally blind but because she's spiritually blind she can't see naturally the things that are spiritual so we find out by the grace of God Amen that this whole world a basically is living in an illusion they really believe that they're right now watch this on the on that message brother brandham says amen for those of us who reject the message listen to it really there is no hope for you when you reject the message you basically commit H H uh blasphemy amen and so there are a lot of people who have been led into an illusion and now amen they are in really uh insane because they've walked away from the truth the only way you can truly believe a lie you must first walk away from the truth so we find out that and the Bible said that's what God did he gave them a strong delusion not just an a illusion or a delusion he gave them a strong one one that cannot be broken and brother Bradman goes on in that message and he tells us amen that because of their dis obedience he said that was their Jubilee and he said when they walk away from this message God bore them with a or in their ear and they'll never be able to hear the message again not that they won't hear with the ear but they won't believe that it's right they won't believe that it's true and look at all the people that have walked away from this message not knowing that they crossed the line of grace and mercy now I'm not talking about backsliders because backsliders know it's true even though they're not living it I'm talking about people who have blasphemed and said negative things and spoke evil of the Holy Ghost it's amazing I was preaching this message and normally I don't listen to that man called camping because he's so far off the word but you know I heard that man preach a message tonight and he literally blasphemed the Holy Ghost he literally called the things that were of God the devil and I thought oh my God such a a intellig and educated man and think about the millions of people that follows this man teaching that he has led into blaspheming the Holy Ghost thank God for a prophet Hallelujah because you and I would have done the same thing truly it looked Wicked truly it looked evil truly it looks like it's not of God but brother brandham said it's the same rain be careful because rain makes the seed grow and M rain makes the tears grow same anointing but different seeds but he called the anointing the devil so you know it's just a lack of understanding but when you see and I thought Lord what an illusion how what a delusion that this man is in because he's really calling everybody else false when he himself is false that's what the Bible said the blind leaders lead the blind and they both shall fall into the ditch one of the things that really stirred my heart up about this message because some of you know about uh uh uh Kenny Copeland and his gang well that's just part of what's really happening how they receiving the pope and it is amazing that the pope amen sends him a personal video now I'm going to read something in Daniel turn with me to Daniel please Daniel 11 you know you look at this thing and you see by the grace of God that nothing is happening out of order amen everything is happening now there is a uniting is't that amazing because here we got into this church and we preach A House Divided cannot stand and we show that it is so important that we as a little group group here would pull more together and be as one now that's something that you can't do uh in human effort it literally takes the Holy Spirit to do it because our true Union comes by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the Bible said by one Spirit are we baptized into one body this cannot be achieved by by man's work or men's H hands but if we all seek the same thing and have the same mind we'll come into the unity of the Faith by the spirit of God now we look at this thing in Daniel 11th chapter beginning at the 21st verse and we're not going to read it all but this is talking about the Antichrist the man that is to come the Bible says and in his estate shall stand up a vile person oh let's say the Pope that we got now is he the Bible say he's vile but the world saying he's good oh he's a good man he's he's popular right and now he's extending his hand to his denominational Brethren to whom they shall not give honor the honor of the Kingdom but he shall come in peaceably oh they weren't going to give him but he's coming in peaceably watch the serpent he's coming in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by what flatteries you're my brother who's to blame for this thing I'm to blame and you're to blame oh he's just sucking them in amen But the saddest thing is amen if they had only listened to the voice they would know what's actually happening right now I'm so grateful that God sent us light in the time of Darkness I don't know what to do and the more I see this thing approaching the more it makes me want to press into it hey somebody Hallelujah we could have been caught right up under that but God called us out and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him and shall be broken yay also the prince of the Covenant and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully but he shall come up and she be shall become strong with the small people and that means amen he that's all he needed is a small group right because remember amen the prophet of God said it's just only 1% in Russia that's communist right they're the ones that's ruling it doesn't take much it just take a real strong hand a real dictator that knows how to surmise he knows how to conquer the people uhh by by his by his flatteries he knows what people like he knows it he's the devil right he's the devil so we realize by the grace of God this Antichrist is a smooth character but what we don't see is that this thing is being fulfilled in our day we're overdue but now we can see the time is running out and remember if you're here when he turns into the Beast that means you missed the rapture you've missed it that's what you don't want to do because you think amen like I heard the other day you say hell but hell amen is just a word in your vocabulary none of us know what it is but let me say it like this it is a place of chaos hello it's a place of suffering it's a place that your mind can't even comprehend the worst horror movie you've ever seen cannot be compare because I'm going tell you something about horror movies they come to an end not in this world not in the world of chaos now I want you to understand this this what we call a world of order has become is becoming more and more every day a world of disorder it's becoming a world of more chaos and look at the wickedness that we see now can you imagine what hell is like when there is it is totally Lawless one thing after the other pain and Agony coming on and listen there is no time clock you and I can't imagine it like we can't imagine heaven we can't imagine what it would be there but it's because they failed to love the truth y'all hear what I'm saying when you fail to love it he didn't say like it he said love it he gave them over to a a strong delusion when you watch those people that's always trying to find fa with what God has brought in this day my God they standing on on Dangerous Grounds it's a difference when you're learning and you're seeking to no truth but when you're seeking to find fa you're in Dangerous Grounds oh help us Lord Jesus God said he chose their delusion here it happened in Pharaoh's day God took a a Fallen King called called called Moses and raised him up he looked like an insane man and he was the truth but they wanted to believe with all of listen God hardens Pharaoh's heart and Pharaoh hardened the people's heart because they believe Pharaoh when they knew Moses was right they were caught under the spirit they were caught under that illusion and they all perished because they may missed the day of their visitation think about it people 2 Corinthians 11:14 you love the Lord It's a powerful it's a powerful illusion of Satan the whole world is going after it now think about it if Satan's Eden is a mixture of everything that is in the world it's I w't I'll be jumping in a minute I'm I'm gonna slow down but I want you to realize amen that Satan amen he loves to to to to take what God has done and and pervert it and make it look right that's what I'm saying second Corinthians please 11:14 it's powerful people and I'm going tell you something what we've got we ought to be praising God for it every day and every night Hallelujah said brother Brooks brother Brooks I'm not what I should be let me put it this way if you're looking at your works if you're looking at your flesh if you're looking at your achievements you miss heav A Million Miles because let me say it like this how can you achieve anything without Jesus Jesus Christ and you got to realize that is what Grace is all about to look at Calvary and to look at the Lamb of God and said it was all enough for me that's it I can't do it so I'm accepting what he's done for me it doesn't mean that we go out and live any kind of life we do whatever we can do to live right before God in appreciation to what he has done for us hallelujah and to know that within your heart amen you're going to make mistakes but when you do you didn't mean to do it you didn't mean to do it and and and and there are times you did but God still died for your sin your iniquity when you knew to do good and you didn't do it second go 11:14 he says what no Marvel which in other words Marvel not for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light and that little that little thing I sent out to some of you by way of the text here it is this man I forgot his name he's liking himself to have the spirit of Elijah reconciliation a Ministry of bringing the hearts of the children to the fathers and the hearts of the father to the children thank God we know the real El Li but the thing that you can see that he's the bridge that's going to take amen this fullness of the Pentecostal church right back into amen this Catholic Church he even called them Catholic and you know what they are they baptized in the name of the father son and allly go there are there is children and you know they basically even the Lutheran Church in this this city has basically recant from what Luther did and they have now accepted the Catholic Church as Brethren they forgotten go back in history it's just a sleeping giant ready to kill and murder all over again oh my goodness what the people don't understand is going to be worse than bloody bloody what say Bloody Mary and H Mary time hallelujah hallelujah and what they you know the people is you know it's a sad thing because what we thought uh would be foolish virgin is actually receiving the mark of the beast brother Bram in that tape uh uh uh uh uh this day the scriptures fulfilled he said you better believe it now he said because if you don't believe it now you will have to seal it your life your with your blood you have to seal you'll have to die for this truth because you wouldn't go further with it he said believe it now right you won't accept the mark but you'll die because you got to seal your blood now when God blood should have been your seal Hallelujah St John 12:36 [Music] what people don't understand this thing can happen it could flip like a life F flip switch overnight and you know and I know most of us you see what Lord I say most of us I'm talking about message people they're not ready how do you make yourself ready by receiving the Seal of the Holy Ghost it's not that you're not going to make mistakes but you know you got the seal you know you got it and the prophet of God said if you got the seal you'll seal to the day of your Redemption nothing can break the seal nothing can break the seal that box cart got to go all the way to his Destiny that's your confidence that's your Assurance amen is in Jesus Christ as the brother preached last week and him alone St John 12:36 love the Lord oh it's true brother I mean we look at all this crazy stuff going on in the message people falling away like flies I mean and and you know you're thinking my God what did you do all these years what were you listening to what were you hearing I mean what you've been in bondage all that time cuz if you in the message and you feel like you in bondage you need the Holy Ghost he's the only one that can liberate you come on somebody how can you be in bondage when a when God has set you free bondage to do what if you in bondage explain to me what you want to do that you can't do let me tell you something if it's sin I want to tell you something you were born in bondage then you were born your body is a is a bondage is that all right amen St John 12:36 well I can't do this why would you want to do it they're not going to do it in heaven y'all I don't I say y'all you said brother what you I'm telling you I know two people amen who I love dearly who turned their backs on this message amen was raised in this message the one the sister daddy was a pastor and they've left this message denounced this message and and she was walking in the mall with a halter top and pants on and saying amen she's never been so free in her life and now they're pastoring together this brother and his wife pastoring together acting like Kenny coping or something huh she's the co-pastor I ain't going to call her name because you'll be shocked but my point is what is it they never had a love for the TRU that little piece of something that's laying there you got to get rid of it like brother bradam said if you don't conquer the demon the demon Will Conquer you amen even if you can't measure all up to it you ought to say Lord amen pink I believe it I believe it hallelujah hallelujah glory to God listen St John 12 amen 3536 then when Jesus said unto them yet a little while as the light with you is the light with you walk while you have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether the whether he goeth while ye have light believe in the light that you may be the children of light huh that you might be the children of light who's carrying the message now Hallelujah you and I children of light we're the only ones that knows where we come from and where we're going these other people amen have come to a place where they don't even believe in a heaven anymore or a Rapture anymore cuz they're in darkness Children of the night and not children of the day is that all right 1 Thessalonians 5:5 I hope you don't mind just flipping these these these you know and and it's amazing because here we are the God is making yourself ready Hallelujah and how do you fully make yourself ready by believing all the word because if one word did misplaced Causes Chaos you got to put it all back together God I don't understand it all but I believe it all he didn't say understand it he said believe it well that old serpent trying to make e uh Eve understanding he didn't tell her to understand nothing he told her just believe it have faith in what I said and don't touch but you know the Lord said you can eat of all the trees you know how he went she believed to that old she believed that stuff you know what I mean oh my God help us Jesus the Bible said You shall die that's what it mean huh it don't mean nothing different than that you shall die is what he mean you shall die people don't understand that they really don't understand it 1 Thessalonians 5:5 we're living in a dangerous time how many Y how many believe that and let me tell you something people of God you know what that Pope said he likened himself as the Joseph and he likened himself as these Brethren he said during that time the Brethren had to come to him he said they had money here the key he had they had money but they couldn't eat is that America he's setting her up she's she her money won't be of any value until they come to Joseph oh people can't you see it he's literally telling them what's going on liking himself to Joseph oh my and the Pentecostals are eating it up eating it up because they failed to believe a little Kentucky 1 Thessalonians 5:5 ye are the children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness Hallelujah we are children of the light I don't care how how many mistakes I I make my head I'm sealed with the True Light of God hallelujah sealed there it's just not it's in my forehead it's in my hands and most of all is in my heart listen he said those who don't believe now will but they will have to seal they're testimony with their blood I think I like the light away I think that way is what I like Hallelujah to go up is that all right see now I want you to understand the Bible so we don't fear the Bible say fear not little flock it is the Father's good pleasure to do what give you the kingdom don't fear fear is what keeps you from it amen y'all hear what I'm saying fear keeps you from it but the promise is it's his good pleasure so you got to say Lord It's your pleasure to give it so give me some pleasure let's have some pleasure here see it's God's will it's his pleasure to give you the kingdom but you don't fear it right fear is torment you know like like these guys said even on the tape but I knew this all along he said fear is false evidence appearing real the devil ain't greater than God you see that's what happens I don't care if you got cancer tuberculosis I don't care what you got that devil he puts a fear because he make you believe the evidence is greater than God no no no no no hallelujah it's your truth God can make the elements back up what about what about demons who can hear right Children of the day don't fear because listen what he says in psalm 16:10 for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to seek corruption who was he talking about the body of Jesus Christ because the theophany man amen was inole he was intact he was the one that knocked on Amen the devil's door he was the one that kicked the devil's door down took the keys and whatever more he did down there but it was his body you God will not suffer you to seek corruption why how come he put the seed in you and he said that seed cannot sin that's the only way it ever happened not because you kept from doing this and kept from doing that it's the seed that's in you that cannot be corrupted Hall thank God for the seed amen yes sir ain't God good to us God's body is protected by his word is that the truth the Bible said if it was possible it will fool the very elected if and the prophet of God comes around and he explained that to us he said it's not possible he said that's all he's saying it's not possible the fool the elect why she's been given the word hallelujah it is the word that keeps her from being deceived we know who the Antichrist is I don't care how sweet it is and I'm going tell you something people of God the test will come because as these Church unites they going to look at you like you're the devil Hallelujah and don't you worry she's like this church this church I have to jump there already this church has the spirit of Jezebel and Jezebel killed 400 prophets in the name of ba Hallelujah she was under a delusion she thought ba was God and God proved to her that old baldheaded man by Elijah by the name of Elijah his God was God Amen and God going to show this this adulterous woman amen who is God did you know brother brandham said the only one that can get rid of this church because it's so strong is God himself Jesus Christ himself is the only one that'll be able to destroy her That's How Strong she is and she's got the wealth of the world in her hand Hallelujah come on somebody and you better believe America is ready to Bow you know she's selfish there was a time they could have fixed it and they wouldn't do it and now they're going to have to sell their Birthright you think about Kenny Copeland he's got the mark already he's already received it and everybody that agreed and said amen this is true this is right was wept underneath the mark of the beast There Is No Escape for that such an illusion such a blindness because they wouldn't believe what William Brandon was preaching and they failed to see it wasn't William brandom now he's constantly saying this in this tape amen this day is the scriptures fulfill he said listen he said this day who else there was no other time when God Elohim came and we Discerning the hearts of the people time of Abraham time of Jesus Christ and now he was basically saying no man could do this see what's happening here he's declaring the end that's 50 something years ago and this is the Jubilee Hallelujah the blood moons amen is in March I believe there a lot of things going on Israel amen has already been prophesied that this this is the season that the true Messiah come back to je to Israel and people were looking like you know like a deer caught in the headlights absolutely not don't let this devil spell B you you know that's what a serpent does right he catches your eyes and once he catch your eyes amen you spell bound that's how you get [Applause] birds hypnotize him or whatever he does and that's what that old serpent is doing right now hypnotizing the people and making them think that he's some great prophet oh it just makes you want to throw up how they was carrying on about this Pope I'm like oh my God worshiping the devil and don't even know it and claiming that they got the Holy Ghost because they spoke in tongues and this Copeland God was speaking in tongues and brother Brandon told us what it was all about all of that don't mean nothing Satan can do it all and he's deceived them by the very thing is that all right the Bible says now she's not not Ren listen there is a Queen of Heaven but she's not the one we got a real Queen of Heaven Hallelujah and that's the blood wash Hallelujah those amen who've been washed in the blood of the Lamb amen say she's sitting there as a queen of Heaven thinking that she's invincible and nothing can destroy her God going to blow her up Hallelujah going to blow her up you see right now it sound cruel but by the time she finished with what she's got to do I think the people will really recognize hell has now come on the earth remember brother bam said that hell was blending into the Earth and you've got to recognize where it all is going right right is in Hollywood and it is in Rome East and West Hallelujah and you got to realize this thing is really culminating right now demons are coming up and a lot of people thinking oh that's so cute ain't nothing cute about it the people are so insane they don't even know who and what they are y'all hear what I'm saying listen it's the truth the spirit of the age and this is what brother brandom tried to bring us to the age that we were living in in and what God was getting ready to do this is the light there shall be light in the evening time this is the light God promised us this is the only way you and I will be able to escape is to stay in the light Once you walk out you're in darkness and I saw a close friend my close friend Amen on his little video tape on his uh on his web page you know you can be saved right now and all you've got to do is just give your life to the Lord sad sad because when you look at the essence of it there's more to it what is a gift this man helped save me one time from a real bad situation but what good is that now when you turn your back on the thing that God came to save you think about it this is the age where the spirit of Ahab is reigning I don't care how powerful Obama look he's weak he's being manipulated by the Roman Catholic Church she's his boss and all the presidents from Kennedy has been likewise ruling and humbled by Jezebel and don't you realize Jezebel go to get what she wants right all neighbor all this president got to say to miss Jezebel we got these bramit and we don't know what to do she says sit back and relax I'll take care of it you want his field we going to go get it right and she killed she killed him just for because Ahab wanted it right and because we don't come into the the alliance with them and agree to give give over our field our inheritance what God gave us hallelujah that will come after us but thank be to God hallelujah when they start all the murdering and the killing the proud will be up it's true it's true when they came to kill the Royal seed in in Egypt Moses was already saved when they came to kill the Royal seed in Bethlehem Jesus was already saved when they come to kill the Royal seed in this day brother brand on that tape he called us the super seed he said we'll be saved hallelujah oh we talked about that peace there it is when they say peace they're not talking about world wars they talking about peace between the churches That's Where It's At when they all come together and they say finally we got peace we're brothers now hallelujah we're Union amen that's the Bible the Bible said they're coming to the unity of the faith brother Brown said they really believe they're coming into a Revival and that that time he'll be receiving the mark of the beast Lord hallelujah how you going to say that ain't of God Amen here they are having a Revival that's where the peace and safety comes in I thought Lord I ain't never seen that before I said God I said I ain't never seen that before I thought oh world peace is church PE because the whole thing is about religion the whole thing is about religion the whole thing about breaking peace over there in Israel because Israel thought it was peace peace between all the churches one uni uni United Catholic Church did you did you know you a Catholic Hallelujah woo but this is also the day of the anointing of Enoch Hallelujah remember Amen in Noah's day amen everybody was doing all kinds of stuff they were so dissatisfied they were marrying giving in marriage you know banqueting you know everything party hardy they were doing all those things and the whole time the ark was being built isn't that true the whole time the world is doing all the stuff naming their Idols come on somebody in the whole time God's building building the ark Hallelujah they don't see it they don't know it amen but the children of light do Hallelujah remember brother BR was basically saying listen this is the spirit of Elijah and I'm trying to call the churches back to repentance like Elijah tried to call Israel back to repentance he said listen listen that's why brother said he said I'm not going to keep it a secret anymore he said it's too late in the evening he said they're worshiping the devil thinking they worshiping God now where did he get that in the scripture because Israel was doing the same thing they were calling on bail thinking that they were worshiping God they were under a strong delusion and Elijah tried to pull him back to the right God because baale means Lord hallelujah and Lord is Lord hallelujah so they were saying Lord to bail but he saying it's the wrong Lord hallelujah that's what he's trying to tell us all this thing this trinitarian Lord is the wrong Lorden tried to call him back and he says okay I'll tell you what to do you cut yourself you just have one of those big parties that you've been doing and he said maybe your God asleep he showed us the fanaticism that will occur in the denomination of churches because they're trying to get an answer from their God under the inspiration of the voice of Elijah they're doing all kinds of stuff Hallelujah but here the Bri of Jesus Christ that's what he said all of you who was on the Lord's Side come on over here hallelujah and he basically built that altar he poured so much water on it amen there was no way amen it could have United Hallelujah but God sat it a fire and licked it all up sh that God is going to give us a flooding of the rain Hallelujah he's going to give a flood rain Hallelujah and when the fire come down we'll go up with the fire hallelujah hallelujah look at that thing hallelujah we're in a time of sodom's day perfect lawlessness Nations all over the world has become that and think you think it's strange I heard on the news today that 50% of America now believes that same-sex marriage is okay 50% hello no 50% so what I'm saying is we beyond Sodom we're Beyond Noah's day we're Beyond it's worse than it's ever been you better believe it we're in a time of Pharaoh's day is that right the Bible said Rose of a pharaoh that didn't know Joseph who do you think your president is he don't know him he don't know God hallelujah neither does he know God's people hallelujah and what is he doing he's laying bricks we got to make bricks without straw the taxes Hallelujah eating us all up people y'all better wake up and smell the coffee I'm working with Spirits I'm not working with people I'm I'm I'm not even thinking about flesh even though I'm calling names I want you to know all these Spirits are here and if these Spirits are here the spirit of God must be it has to be because the Bible said when Satan comes in like a flood the spirit of God lifts up a standard Hallelujah that's right amen and what did he do amen he had no respect this Pharaoh for God's chosen people is that right no he didn't he his whole his whole the end of the whole thing was let's go kill them all let's go kill them all h turn with me now second Corinthians living at a time we when it's scary to me I don't know about you guys I I think about death all the time every day it seem like it's on my heart and mind uh not because I'm just getting older but I realize it's imminent if the Raptor don't take place one the other one will y'all hear what I'm saying and and I'm constantly thinking praying every day God is my witness I got to be ready I got to be ready that's all that matters to me nothing else matters to me 1 Corinthians 6 beginning at the 14th word verse says be not be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship have righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion have light with dark Darkness we we will walk over that scripture we just walk all over it and what Concord ha Christ with bah what Accord we're not on one Accord what Accord does does does does Christ have with bah or what part had he that believeth with an Infidel how we don't walk together with with an Infidel and what agreement have the temple of God here it is with Idols yeah you know y'all heard about Beyonce uhhuh y'all y'all what are the a lot of these names shouldn't even come out of our our mouths they're Idols you can't be a chrisan and admiring something of the world you know if you're going to speak you speak the truth of them that there must not be some admiration what agreement have the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God there is no other Temple there is no other go place where God abide except in the hearts of man and God have said I will dwell in them walk in them I will be their God and they shall be my people Children of the light hopeing God nowhere near be a same come on somebody do you remember the prophet of God said amen that that the Catholic church is the highest form of spiritualism it ain't that fellow am man with the witch bones rling his toys hallelujah it's the one dressed up like priests holy going into into the depths of Satan Hallelujah you better believe he's got to be powerful because amen he so powerful he'll get a greater demon than Beyonce he get the Beast he get the real thing he get he get Satan himself and here we can't even get the Holy Ghost come on you know what it is because those people about that business every day they're seeking ways amen if they got to fast 40 days to let a demon come in they'll do it did y'all know that that's what they do they get out of themselves now we don't have to go that measure but my point is our way of getting the Holy Ghost is simpler just saying Lord I surrender all and really believe really mean it Lord I don't even know what all is but whatever it is you know all is all I surrender all and that's what I want I want your Holy Spirit Hallelujah is that okay now we look look at this thing and you saywell brother Brooks what we we're Spirit of ant luian day is the same brother BR said that was the age amen when men's achievements was highly recognized far beyond beyond God's is that right it was it was man's achievement man's flesh amen counterfeiting things and making things and it was all man that's why when God came down in Noah and bought built this little Ark they must have laughed that's all your education can produce you know what I'm saying it had to be something on that on that wise he had looked like a fool I don't care what these movies are showing amen these people dressed all primitive and didn't know what they were doing brother brandom says Amen in in this day uh This Day scriptures fulfill he said they were far more Highly Educated way above us and that's what's wrong with our scientist they don't want to acknowledge it and they know the Egyptians and all of them were far more Highly Educated than we are looking at these pyramids built on one end of the the scope of the world to the other end and underwater and above water and they they know we can't do it to this day yeah a hurricane come by there they ain't moving them bricks they ain't moving no Stones they so built in a way see math mathematically correct oh my God help us Lord amen and what was it amen all these Spirit are loosed on us and this is what we talking about amen the river of Euphrates the Bible said amen in World War I all those demons was loosed the bride and herself had not even been recognized as a bride yeah World War I but they were loosed and they were waiting for come on you got to realize this now because that's exactly what they were doing Amen in the old they waited waited oh it's got to come we'll see the the evidence of her being here and when she comes we'll get her see God comes along in in this little KY and and and you know slowly moved him up the up the line like it did Moses they didn't even realize it amen come on somebody and then we look at this thing and here now they seeing this seven seal don't you think if the astrologist saw the birth of William brandham you better believe the Catholic Church saw the move of those seven angels they know we're right yeah but just like those of the of the of the New Testament let's kill him so that we can inherit him his inheritance they knew Jesus but they said let's kill him so we can inherit his inheritance they wanted the church when the church belonged to him they want the bride they'll never get her though Hallelujah Satan wanted us from the beginning of time Hallelujah but he can't get us why because God hid Us in the last book of life brother brand said Not only did God choose us he saved us and he sealed us before the foundation of the world so am I you going to be oh Lord I hope I get to seal if you were sealed before the foundation of the world you'll be sealed before it's all over withen in the eyes of God you sealed amen hallu that's just the way it is hallelujah God the Bible said God once wink that ignorance God don't wink that ignorance no more and you know God don't care whether we believe it in he don't care there's billions of people in Hell who who didn't believe they didn't believe Jesus was the Christ so what you think about William brandom they don't believe that he was a prophet they don't even care you know or he was too hard on women I don't mean no harm sisters but don't you think it was a woman that got us in trouble I don't mean is the truth she was the one that let down to God and because of that that's why God's hard on her that's why she's so emotional because that's where Satan worked on at it's not that you you you know God think of you less but he knows the abilities that's it he don't think no less he just know the ability of us to move you know you to move into into those emotional Realms and you know that's why man and woman anden we have a hard time because the woman is emotional man is not and the he don't know he don't understand he's just don't and he's he thinking is all that necessary but that's just the way we made it up we can't help [Laughter] it you know but my point is this let let me move on we're living in a time where everything has been revealed if you and I miss the Rapture it's nobody fault but our own you can't blame God he done gave you more than enough right we allow things to distract us understand we shouldn't do that because that was a sign of of of of Miss lot she allowed herself to be distracted at the wrong time it was time to go up and she was being distracted see what I'm saying she was already ascending and she allowed herself to be distracted y'all hear what I'm saying and that's what it is God is building your character and everything else it's not time to be distracted because if so you get left behind hello is that all right I'm almost closed with this uh we'll finish this on Sunday but I wanted to wanted to say this by the grace of God because there's a lot more to it uh but I wanted to kind of like put it all together uh with this one scripture Hebrews 12:25 we'll let you go early tonight you love God I people of God we we're blessed we we're so blessed let me let me say something happened to me today a brother called me from South Carolina a young brother I knew him when he's a boy and I missed his call but he left it on the voicemail he said brother books he said he said I he said I I just wanted to call you to let you know how much I appreciate your messages online he said I have been revived so many great things have happened because I have been able to listen to the messages online I don't know whether they still moving or not but I just say I if we could get them going because other people have called as well and you know what gets me most of us don't even listen to him but that's okay God got got somebody that's going to listen and you got to understand this particular young man was trapped in a situation that God is TR to deliver him from see Satan sat Satan want to hinder us he want to stop us because he we don't realize the magnitude of what's really going on you know I say this even from my little CS that you'd be surprised all over the world even the Cs that I didn't even like people are liking and believing and enjoying y'all hear what I'm saying you you do a little put a little bread upon the Water the Bible said it'll come back it's the little things that God call Great and and I think people missing it it ain't about a name it's not even about a position it's just doing what God want you to do that's what God called Meek doing the will of God that's God's meekness that's your meekness in God doing what God asked you to do that's it it that's it Hebrews 12 closing on this 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh but if they escape not who refus him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven and God spoke from Heaven those Seven Seals Came From Heaven Hallelujah come on somebody amen and didn't he say God was going to shake the Heaven and Earth when those seals God blasted and said the Judgment going to hit uh uh the West Coast amen it shook Heaven and Earth people don't understand what day we're living in that scripture has been fulfilled and is being fulfilled right now people look at a little Kentucky and they fail to see by the grace of God it wasn't a man it was God behind the man veiled but he's given them a strong delusion people in here have the you know they they let their minds blind them even when it comes to the pastor preaching is it Pastor Brooks or is it God if it's the word is God you know and my thing is God Amen is moving and trying to get the people Amen to a place H I don't know how you've pressing but I'm pressing and it doesn't get easy it will not and it does not get easy but let me ask you a question though will it be worth it all you think to yourself it's worth it all every pain every whatever I go through it's going to be worth it all because I'm going tell you something people let me say like this i' I've heard so many people you gonna always owe somebody you just try to do what you can do to pay him right right you I'm saying that's the system the system is you gonna always owe somebody I don't care if you got billions of dollars you going to owe somebody you going to die oing somebody because people that got a lot of money they don't always pay their bills why should they when they got a lot of money y'all hear what I'm saying you gonna always oh that what brother say he said just let the people know you gonna pay and the Bible said owe no man nothing in this system is impossible not to owe anybody know what I'm talking about you know unless you're going to live way out in the country you got your own well you got your own little mortal thing a going on with your electricity you really out there in the wilderness and guess what more than likely you're going to have to pay taxes y'all hear what I'm saying you go ow somebody nothing's free so why did I'm saying all that because I'm saying to you do your best but don't let these things consume you till it take you off the purpose for which you were born takes you away from that you're not supposed to be taken away not at this day and time not at this day and time and I'm not saying say quas I'm not saying that whatever will be will be but I'm point trying to say do the best but when you know you've done your best you say thank you and Hallelujah anyhow am I making sense don't worry it's not time to worry I mean we've got to have faith in God have faith and enjoy your this portion of your salvation let us stand it's true that's all I'm trying to say don't let the devil take your joy don't let him take away you know what God done gave to you you know this thing is is a beautiful situation amen you think about it and I'm going tell you something you look at Peter James John when they thrown into jail and prison amen and you know those those were real prisons they were real there was no luxury nothing luxurious about that and I understand that you know the Roman jails were worse in all jails and they got in there praising God and thanking the lord and the angel came down shook the shook the foundation and it now that was yesterday and and and less than two days ago and if God did it for them he'll do it for us but our attitude must measure up meet up to what God would have us to do you see Praise Him in all situation yes you going to have those things they hit you real hard but at the same time once you regroup you go back to worship amen huh let's have a word of prayer father God we come before you Lord asbl we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy God you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves forgive us of our sins and our trespasses Lord we pray father that you would take the word of God and just let it grow into the hearts of the people I pray father God that you would just give us Lord God a victory ious day oh Lord and Lord shall we uh live to see tomorrow I pray that you give us tomorrow as a Day of Victory Lord in our lives glorifying you testifying of you Lord and thanking you for all that you brought us through Lord we love you tonight we appreciate you Lord and there's no words that can express our gratitude for being part of this evening life gracious father God give us wisdom on how to win others to you Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ name
