one thing we want to do by God's grace put forth a greater effort of getting on here on time you know uh you can't see a person Zeal unless you see the zelus in the least of things and we all ought to be zealous about God just like brother bam said we should be anticipating our coming to the Lord's House be a place where we could hardly wait I'm going to say this again at the end of the service because there are still some some who are not here yet we want to welcome our visitors I want my wife to look at this young man right here he looks like Johnny doesn't he he looks like my neew yeah same smile same complexion same head amen we appreciate the Lord Jesus amen he and his lovely wife and family brother I forgot your name if you would say brother brother Mark praise the Lord glad to have you here you're welcome in this place happy birthday my brother you did good on that song I didn't know you could sing so well amen God is good to us you know I feel so good this morning because I realize the time and the season that we're living in and I trust God will not allow me to lose sight of that and I trust that you can see the time that we're living in but as we stand let us turn to Romans 9 uh 2123 hopefully we'll be able to finish up this this series that we've been trying to do being made in the image and lightess and Order Of God Amen Romans n 21- 23 have not the poter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another one unto dishonor for what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endure with much long suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he have aord prepared unto Glory one more scripture second Peter the first chapter reading from the second verse through the fourth verse of that particular chapter Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and my apology I have one more scripture Hebrews 4 2-4 verses 2- 4 unto us was the Gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have have believed do enter into rest amen as he saith as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world Amen and he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works let us pray our gracious father God we have read your holy word you're the only one that could break it for us break it so oh God that the people will recognize your presence Lord and Lord you said we two or three are gathered in your name there you are in the midst so Lord we know that you're here for those who have the Holy Spirit oh God has brought you to this place and father we pray father that you have preeminence in the service this morning God my thoughts Lord remove my person that they will hear from you this morning we ask these things in your lord J name Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated as we said earlier we're glad to have everybody here this uh we're trying to wrap uh we're trying to uh bring this to an end or close but we realize by the grace of God that the word of God is inexhaustable you can take one subject and you can carry on for years of your life but but by the grace of God I trust that we can kind of put a cap on this so that we so that we can understand of God for our day my subject this morning is mold me make [Music] me into your image and order we are familiar with the message statue of a perfect man and of course brother bradam took that out of second Peter the first chapter Hallelujah now those scriptures were not just written there just to uh Mesmerize the mind but Peter under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost was really laying out something that vital to the Rapture vital to the script vital to the Christian excuse me in order for us to attain a Rapture never have God in the scripture laid his nature out on page Hallelujah but because of the opening of the word We Now understand that God is trying to identify [Music] uh to his people by way of his divine nature the beauty of this whole thing is that God has opened the door for those who would believe hallelujah hallelujah now we understand that character is not just given to you character is a viory hallelujah amen the thought that came to my mind I saw it uh just the other day and it says we have the humility to repent but we don't have the humility humility to surrender see it's not good enough just to repent because after you repent you must surrender hallelujah hallelujah it just kind of reminds me how Jesus said to zakus this day we're going to have dinner or lunch at your house and zakus repented but he didn't stop there he surrendered that means he was willing those things that were wrong and this was the inspiration of the holy spirit this was the inspiration and it should be whenever we move into the presence of the Lord it should bring conviction so much so that we repent but repenting is not just the end of it a work to do after repentance and work is to surrender surrender what your ideas thoughts Hallelujah whatever that's in you is contrary to the nature of let's work with that a minute you that is contrary to the nature of Christ must be surrendered because Darkness and Light can occupy the same space hallelujah hallelujah you see this message came to change us hallelujah hallelujah and it's amazing to me that the message has been here so many but we see little Chang in the people reason why because we made the message Sy and a system can never change you it's exactly what the Pharisees did took the word of God system end of the day when John Christians we are not to be struggling to live holy amen amen is that right because when the Holy Ghost comes the Holy Ghost bring change you can live as straight as you possibly can you can live as straight as you possibly and without the Holy Ghost you still lost and that Holy Ghost has been so downplayed in this message Hallelujah when we we we must recognize the Holy Ghost is the most important Stone Hallelujah that is that right the Bible said that's what Israel rejected the stone but Jesus Through the preaching cor Stone has become the headone and in order to get there have the Holy Ghost have a real birth hey don't tell me that you got the real deal take trials and temptations because the Holy Ghost is greater than any trialer into any tempation Hallelujah so much so Paul said we are more than con barely making it not Victorious amen amen hallelujah hallelujah is that right I mean you can have the promise and the promise is given to us like the promise was given to Jacob Jacob with the promise was still a liar he still was deceitful that's the truth he didn't his nature didn't change he rled with the angel and then his nature was changed his name was changed from Jacob to Isel from a to a prince hallelujah hallelujah and you don't have to worry about you would recognize the change the change is so awesome the places I used to go I don't go there no more people I used to be with anymore Hallelujah the things I used to do do those things hallelujah hallelujah I didn't change [Music] me hallelujah hallelujah when the Holy Ghost comes in you change yourself changes Hallelujah hallu and Paul describe it like this we move from glory to Glory Hallelujah that's right higher and higher but I find out that people are moving lower and Hallelujah there's only one way one door one Lord Faith what baptism hallelujah hallelujah your religion can't save you believeing believing in William brandham doesn't save Hallelujah being part of a message Church don't save you only one Savior and that is Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and that's exact what William BR did the Baptist the one I've been looking for yes sir now we're feasting on the bloody bleeding word the message he brought Hallelujah is Christ alive you understand me if you truly believe it you truly receive it it will change you hallelujah hallelujah but you got to just not you you must not only believe it you got to receive Hallelujah so let me say like this there is no way you be able to receive it without a prayer life amen like I preach Wednesday and I got this start I think from uh uh well it's not important a brother he said when you at War what does the enemy look for uh he look for the place to strike he for those the powerful place the strong places and and that's where the enemy will strike you because he knows if I can take those uh that position down I can win the war brother said that our greatest weapons and prayer amen and that's exactly where has has has has bombarded people of God prayer in reading and understanding the word time amen those tapes are not there to collect dust and now we don't even have tapes anymore we we got them in digital form when was the last you had an Hour of Prayer amen and you wonder why you're weak you wonder why you're being defeated because the devil found your weaknesses that right come on people of God you perhaps when you were younger Samson Hallelujah taking the enemy down Hallelujah but Samson did one thing he met the world he met right he told Delilah her his secret and Delilah did what cut his secret off separated him from The Authority in the power of the C that's what the devil does when he see you not praying not reading you know what that's the spirit of delil what's going to happen going to become more worldly is that right brother bam says that the Christian used to come to church for entertainment now we got entertainment entertainment we got so much of it to the word of God doesn't mean much to us anymore if the preacher is not acting he's got to put something in it hallelu what did Jesus do he spoke the word and the Bible said he didn't even have a voice like mine so lowkey he didn't shout like John Hallelujah but when you love the word you don't care how it comes you're not by the preachers in motion not here to see that you come to see Jes you come to know he's here hallelujah you come to enter into that anointing that anointing will be your entertainment am that's exactly right but I'm going tell you what we've done so you can see clear picture jump but we have allowed Hollywood to enter into the message that's true amen and people have joined themselves to Ministries because the way a man can articulate or preach but that's opposite to the scripture that's right brother BR said I didn't come to you with enticing words and man's Wisdom came power and demonstration ghost y'all hear what I'm saying and what have we done this is this is is not to throw off on music you know I love music but people are so into entertainment they can't come to church for a half hour because we don't entertain them in our music hallelujah hallelujah yes we still sing hyn and we don't have the the prettiest voices HJ God but why should that stop you if we are singing about your Lord hallelujah hallelujah and you might even say that brother can't sing well if he can't sing why don't you come and sing Hallelujah Hallelujah you see what we have done we've allowed theila to come in and offer pleasure in such a way we don't even know we're being deceived hallelujah hallelujah y hear what I'm saying when the last you've seen a miracle hallelujah hallelujah was it Gideon he said if God be with us the Miracles he didn't say that just to say it because wherever Jesus is is a lot of noise there's action going on Hallelujah this church should be a hospital be where the Sinners could come of God and come right in here and be healed not only healed but delivered hallelujah hallelujah but what is the atmosphere we're bringing because you're the one that's bringing the atmosphere but the prophet of God says that the Bride of Jesus Christ has the ability to change the atmosphere so when you come into church atmosphere is not like you know it should set it on fire all it takes is one person to light another I wrong with that that woman at the well there's a man over there told me everything come see the man hallelujah hallelujah she was on fire lit up the whole city hallah don't tell me it can't be done you know that it can be done because we have a prophet one man with his ministry the whole world on fire hallelujah hallelujah but you see we we come in and want to be entertained and when it's just entertainment it only goes to the head you leave out y'all we've done it I'm guilty we we've done it for years this must stop we must come we must let God transform our mind we must come to a place that God will renew our mind I'm going to church and I'm going to see Jesus hallelujah hallelujah I don't care what he's wrapped in but I want to see Jes is that right because that's what God promis Us in this day how many of us believe you're following the and if I'm following the pillar of Fire these signs them that believe not just the preacher one of us who claim to be Believers and if signs and wonders are not following then we need to find out what the problem is I love it and that Pastor came and says believe this church is not where it should be it's the TRU we we we shouldn't have to uh be concerned coming on time now I'm not talking to the ones that work late at night in the morning I'm talking to those who can be here hallelujah coming here a half hour early as much as possible preparing the atmosphere for the preacher Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah understand what's happening here God is molding [Applause] you he's making you Hallelujah Hallelujah you know but he need you to stand still remember brother talk about the little child try to put the on the child and the more the child move arm in [Music] there child stand still then you can put the co on the jack on the child but as long as you moving God can't clo you like moving there hallelujah hallelujah we need to stand still the like this you need to make up your mind is your church brother Brooks is the pastor of the church you need to make up your mind what you going to do about it Hallelujah because if God has ordained me the shepher hallelujah hallelujah but you see we get in ourselves like Samson we look at something in the world Samson mom and dad says Samson M and why you want to go get a a a worldly girl isn't there beautiful girls among the message but you want to go get something wild tell y something so you understand means delicate you know what I'm saying all sweet fragile fragile she didn't look like she could do any harm but what Samson didn't know he forgot what she really was a Philistine is a Philistine hallelujah hallelujah I don't care if you dress a serpent in still a serpent you don't know what you getting out there and you got to be certain you know what you're getting in here amen cuz there are serpents in the message y'all looking at me like I'm crazy it is a it's not the part the one who has power over the clay make you hallelujah it's the truth we fail to see that time is running out is that right now remember listen people if you know you're not a serpent I wasn't talking to you so don't let the devil say he was talking to me you can call me a devil all you want to I know I'm not oh realize this morning that you a true son and daughter of God we all need help amen yes Lord hallelujah hallelujah you can't make yourself you canot mold yourself in the image of God is the we are the CL it takes his hands us and to shape us into His Image I don't know nobody or I don't know anybody that came to the message already holy come on I was a mess y'all know what I mean by that I didn't have no form nor shape amen you say I knew what I was but the Bible tells us that we were all born perverted so how you going what you was Hallelujah when the devil gave you a little bit of this and a little bit of that Hallelujah that's why we needed Jesus Christ he was the very image and likeness of God did not matter many in his time Jesus Christ was the only man everything else was part serpent man hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus was thorough bre Hallelujah he was the pure seed of godall that's why you need the Holy Ghost because that Holy Ghost that life that was in Jesus Christ comes to Quicken the [Music] seed that's in you and once the seed is Quicken the tree will automatically grow amen I see my grandson over there and he's in that growing stage look like he go to sleep and when he wake up he another inch he didn't do it he did nothing life that's in him that determined his growth at his time hear saying all he has to do is eat sleep and get up that's it as long as he follows those basic principles he does have to worry about being saved as long as you eat the word rest on the word you don't have to worry now now Temptation will come the Bible tells us greater is he that is in Us in the world hallelujah hallelujah many are the afflictions of the righteous God God delivered them out of them all you said oh brother books I need Deliverance your deliverance has come Hallelujah you don't oh I'm waiting for my deliver your deliverance is come receive it amen hallelujah John Crow Johnny Crow had been released from his pole is that right y'all remember the story brother said the owner had already released him joh was going around like this didn't even know he could fly off that's what's wrong with a lot of bad habits you can't comprehend being delivered God wants to do something with you tell God I can't do it still in bondage that's from the Devil son is set free the spirit of the Lord is hallelujah hallelujah oh my no devil y'all hear me will keep should should be able to keep you in bondage no devil should be able to keep you in bondage amen when you in Christ amen amen you love the Lord hallelujah hallelujah you see because we come into an end not the end of the message but every one of us going to have to die if we don't die we go into Rapture somehow in this Dimension You' only given a few years to live you say oh she lived C 91 91 is a few years to Eternity y'all hear me and the Bible said the suffering of this world be compared to the glory that God has awaiting for us look what Paul says in second Timothy 4 6-8 how many of y'all believe y'all bride I didn't say how many of y'all feel like I said how many believe nobody will take that from me well I don't like brother books you don't have to like me but you must love me there might be some ways about me you don't like that has nothing to do with me loving you understand me I got children that got ways I don't like but I love my children Hallelujah come on somebody you you got ways that God don't like but God still love you now let me break it down to the church when you see ways that brothers and sisters and the Bible said that love covers a multitude like I said Wednesday I I know the brother didn't mean no harm he said some of those people I can't stand in the moment he said that I said you a murderer I broke that Devil's Back what you talking about a Christian you can't stand somebody stand is another way of saying I hate this you feel that way about anybody Spirit y'all hear me because you what do you mean what do you mean because even though you can't kill them physically you definitely kill them spiritually you speak them whatever you can you would speak do whatever you can to kill their reputation is a murderer and no murderers will enter that City see I didn't come to tickle your ears I tell truth CH I wish I could change you change cuz I can't change me I wish I could change me who can change and he said you have not because you ask not if you don't know how to pray God God teach me how to pray Peter asked him told Peter what to say even if you don't know how to express love don't it doesn't mean they don't have love for you but some people are broken through trials test friendships they're broken and and that's that's only God can repair that so they don't know how to release it they feel here but they have trouble because they don't want to be hurt am I telling the truth you see I was hurt really bad more than once but I said I'll never let myself get close to anybody like that again and the Holy Spirit said to me I'll be I never be able to perfect you until you give me your heart am oh I'mma guard my heart you guard your heart if you want you are supposed to experience pain that kind of [Music] experience will never let you forget y understand me when Jesus said take up your cross follow me a cross is painful when you when when Jesus said in the Garden of Gethsemane father not my will but thine be done he was not only willing to obey but he knew in obeying he must also surrender am y'all hear me and he so surrendered when they St in his face he said nothing I'm talk about divine nature if you are a sheep is your nature like I said Wednesday if if if Judas had only understood the course that he was going to cause everybody to take he wouldn't have never did what he did because Judas being a disciple of Christ betrayed him it gave the Pharisees to capture him and with all of that those people that may have been on the border of believing became a disbeliever unbeliever they screamed it out if you be the Christ the cross Hallelujah think about all of the Jews that was has been under the inspiration of the devil released you hear what I'm saying because I'm going tell you like this a preacher is going to anoint you with life or death that's exactly right that's why brother say stay with the word hallelujah hallelujah he you say well what do you mean every time the angel of life the death angel is there too Moses was a type of life hising live but the death angel was there too and he anointed and and everybody follow and Di amen amen hallelujah just that saying Moses you think you greater you think you're the only one he didn't have to think it he was the only one one Shepherd hallelujah hallelujah they may not have like brother Bram it didn't matter didn't make himself what he was made him hallelujah hallelujah and look at the condition of the churches now hallelujah hallelujah because why the angel of life was moving moving too is that right there were there were people anointed bring death amen and even in this message people taking away the Holy Ghost is bringing death to the people but people don't know because they followed the system so long know something is wrong they can't put it together let tell you how to know that you're right brother teaching on what the Holy Ghost is he tell you how to get the Holy Ghost and he tell you desper you won't get itah he tells you getting the Holy Ghost everything else is out of order and when it's out of order it brings chaos amen you said well brother BS I don't know let me ask you a question how many preachers or pastors you know in this message that really love each other fighting everywhere is a bad SP this one is right and that was right they don't even know they Anointed The Devil got them anointed think right I'm tell you now you say well why would you say that brother preached the message times and signs United times and sign it is time for us to unite but how can we Unite Holy Ghost by one Spirit into a body is that right our Prophet said the Holy Ghost is not jumping and Shout it's not speaking in tongue running up and down the aisle Hallelujah amen all of that is good hallelujah hallelujah but I'm going tell you something I don't care how you claim to say you got [Music] it the change is not there you better seek God cuz your systematic way of worship be accepted before God amen amen because we sing message songs and some of them you got to be careful they be glorifying the bride more than the glorify Jesus Christ oh God help us Jesus see we must stay in line in order with the word hallelujah hallelujah is that okay let me move on coming from the message dedication paragraph 39 brother says now we find out that there lays a great spiritual application here that I would like mainly to refer to now let me say this so cuz I feel this thing I ain't talking about your preacher cuz I don't know and there's going to come a pressure that's going to put all these people back together be a paradox and brother Bram said Hallelujah that the squeeze will do that so much so we won't worry about each other's Doctrine Hallelujah we'll be so glad to see a true Christian that's the truth it's the doctrines that separated us when those men put compile the conduct in order that was to bring the bride together but instead it separated us hallelujah we weaponized it Peter with the sword and if you fight with the sword the sword or by the sword you fight with this word that same word is going to turn around and kill you because that's not what it's for amen amen how are we going to love each other my children are different I've got eight but I love them unconditionally and that's the way it's supposed to be here we supposed to love each other uncondition hallelujah hallelujah we supposed to be concerned with one another Hallelujah huj somebody don't show up for church y'all supposed to go call we'll wait to the pastor do it do it look like I got all kinds of arms up here one man but look at the body amen amen hallelujah hallelujah you know I'm going take say it like this cuz this would come to my heart there should be nobody in this church who would lose a car or a because they can't pay the bill and shame on those people who go that far without telling the church that's your pride hallelujah hallelujah we supposed to be helpers of one another that's the TRU but you know we'll do let it happen and we gossip about it that's not love but if we were in the spirit we'll catch those things and God connects you with each other so you can helpers of one another ain't no way I'm going to be sitting up in my house hungry and I know my brother got a lot of food right see I can feel your pride I can feel your pride pride ain't never fed nobody I'm just telling you too much pride amen yes sir that's got to die you know got to die amen let me tell y'all something I'm going go in with when I was young like it perhaps we're in Congo or wherever you from the neighborhood was your parents and when you were hungry you can go to any house the food smell is coming from or they would share with you whatever when it come to barwing food or borrowing money that's the truth my sisters they would bake cakes they might start off with flour but they knew the neighbor had some flavor had and it was round up and all people say once is made once the cake is made don't forget to save me a piece that family I remember one time I made the mistake my next neighbor old lady she said Junior will you cut my grass and I said how much you going to pay me well I got [Laughter] paid yes sir that was one of those things your neighbor asked you to do something better not ask for money you money to try to return it that's the truth nowadays we bring our calculators that's wrong that was a natural man about the spiritual man y hear what I'm saying I got rebuked and I had to go cut her grass yeah by the time my mama finished I was I was ashamed of myself let me move on now now we find out that there lays a great spiritual application here that I would like mainly to refer to Hallelujah if you read the first Kings findom began to build the temple that his father had been promised through he would build you see he stayed in line with with the scriptures promises now that's what we must also do to be successful stay in line with godom no matter how it seems best to go this way that way stay lined with the scripture and Solomon know that God promised his father David build the temple let me say it like in our terms there is temples that's being built order for those temples to be built properly must St in line with the word hallelujah hallelujah it is God's order is that right you can't take denominational stuff do that you high Brea and you never get the results God promis you st with the unadulterated word you got to love God architecture is that right the Bible calls us living ston and we must love each other regardless to how differently shaped we are Hallelujah is that right because these Stones built Solomon Temple all over the place and they all were shaped differ but each Stone had to respect the other Stone hallelujah hallelujah and listen by the time God finished building the Temple without a [Music] hammer they were perfectly fit and joined together that's how this assembly is supposed to be brought you here I didn't bring you here God brought you here God brings people together them to unite not divide Amen brother says in dedication he says now if you notice material wasn't found only in Palestine that this Temple because it was just there he had to go to the rest of the world world to find these parts that would go in this Temple let me say it like this so you better understand it God didn't bring you to America amen not for you to remain tribal God brought you here to be the bride and God brought you here to unite with one another to where you come from when you say I'm not part of your tribe tribe of Judah of Judah and we're supposed to UN in the hallelujah amen that's the truth I guarantee you I could go to and find somebody that look like me like I was telling my brother he looked so much take a picture of you before you look like my nephew especially when he I'm going tell you a miracle miraculous thing about him he is living right now on somebody else's heart he had a heart transplant he should have been dead years ago you to see him he's standing strong hallelujah hallelujah he's come through a lot of things Hallelujah but he's God God still made the man successful Hallelujah brother I don't know how successful you are I pray God blesses you to be hallelujah hallelujah now we look at this thing he he had to go to the rest of the world to find these parts that would go in this Temple what a beautiful application that is that God don't just cut his material out of Jews only or out of the white only or out of the browned whatever color they may be or whatever just out of United States only Canada only he cuts his materials from all the world hallelujah hallelujah y'all hear me that's why the devil plays the racial card he knows he can keep the racial thing goinging of the Bride color they are they believe this word this word that's my brother that's sister hallelujah hallelujah that's right that's the problem you know you say in the message when I was preaching down in in in Ohio majority of the 99% of the people were white cple other black family we were the only hallelujah hallelujah like my son like to say we were the only chocolate chips I still love the people understand me when I left that church to come here and cried like babies I came here because I knew God wanted me here when I go down there still treat me like royalty they respect me you understand what I'm saying I never took advantage of them Hallelujah like I'll never take advantage of you Hallelujah but I tell you what I had a sister come to me there were some who had these issues with color love them anyway because sometime people can't help it trying to overcome trying to overcome something else we're equal my problem may not be what theirs is I'm overcoming no devil is going to stop me from loving my [Music] brother how does it feel to be a black man a white church I said I really never noticed I said but I've been told that when you washed in the blood we all are white like snow I said I didn't realize that there was such thing black church and a white chood it was just a bride [Music] church that just shows how carnal people can amen like you've heard me say and I don't say that if you don't like me if I can't be your friend that's your lost cuz I try to be the best that I can be when it come to let me move on if while they were cutting the stones of the certain kind that was found in such part of the country and maybe cutting a stone over in another Nation to the stone that was cut in another Nation now it might have seemed very strange to the people five pastors by the scene that these odd looking Stones being cutor by I'm sorry but God in his own way was doing something and God didn't bring y'all here by chance God called you here to do a work for him everything else that y'all doing come secondary you're oated to God first otherwise you're out of order and your life at the end of the day is going to be chaotic until you bring yourself back into the amen is that right I'm not going to read this quote brother talk about the preview of the bride and he said Miss America was being led by what Hallelujah she had become stubborn and rebellious Hallelujah let me bring it down to you let me bring it down to you when you don't want to do as God say do you are stubborn and the spirit that's being you being led by the spirit of Witchcraft that's right Hallelujah and it's going to catch up with you because brother bham said like this that a Miss America Church it wasn't [Music] ascending continue to walk they descended they into the region of the L and people of God there are people right now that is ascending they are growing in the grace of God getting higher and higher and there are those who are going down because of your leadership the Holy Ghost to lead you brother Brooks holy spirit is your guide Hallelujah I'm almost done I can feel it be witched by see be witched by Satan's Entertainment Games politics TV Facebook Tik Tok I'm not saying all these things are evil when they are in a in the wrong place that's when they become evil right God must be first in everything HJ when you choose to look at Facebook when you know you should be reading you have allow Facebook to elevate itself saying and to be honest with you I don't have time for my nephew put that put me on that in the beginning and when I put my name on it everybody wanted me to do something call Facebook I don't know what they call it but anyway when I saw all of that all I could think about was my email I get so much email I didn't need another email account Hallelujah and I thought to myself what if there be somebody out there that want to kill me I get on Facebook they could come knock on my door thought is I'm not condemning you I'm this make sure God is first is not first you are out of order going to get you hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody Paul says First Corinthians I'm 2 1 through 10 because this church got to come up we we've got to die and R to ourselves we got to let cuz I'm going tell you we reap what we s you know how many times we had great Services people come up they they seem to be repenting but after repenting they're not willing to surrender zakus says zakus when he met Jesus he said I'm giv everything back got to double it up give it back y'all hear me when when when when God comes truly in you it automatically cleanses you amen you will look like a mad man trying to make all things right nobody has to tell you amen first chapter first verse I'm sorry second chapter first verse and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determin not to know anything among you say Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world World know of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory did y'all hear that which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God prepared for them that love him but God had revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things y the Deep things of God and so we must bear that image likess of God no unclean thing will enter and the Bible says nothing that makes it a lie Hallelujah nothing that makes God's word a lie we are children we are his offspring is that right acts 17 you don't have to turn there say so Hallelujah you love the Lord we are designed to be the temple of God hallelu the Bible says what know you not which is Jo to AOL said he be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit hallelujah hallelujah and there are certain things you cannot do bejoy to the Lord hallelujah right in closing I'll say it again there's so many things I could have said uh but I want you to understand where I'm I'm where I'm coming from Brother bam never had to say he was Malachi 4 he never had to say he was Elijah the very character of the man the works that were produced def finded him in the scripture we should never have to say we're bride and because you say you're bride doesn't make you bride only the character of Christ in you will Define you as hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord let me let me finish just notice I'm going to close Satan is still subtle but if you're not watchful you'll find a serpent wrapped around you holding you in prison it's so it's amazing I've never heard a serpent crawl I don't care I've never I don't know what that sound like I've never heard one but I've always I've walked on one walked up to [Music] one how did he get there he wasn't there a minute ago you understand me and that's how the devil works you don't know he's coming after until you see him and he now is en ranged to bite right and that's what prophet God call it so I'm going to say to you by the grace of God refocus refocus yourself examine your as the Bible says to see whether you be in the faith and if you're not where you should be you need to pray now as a Christian you may not be perfect yet but you should know you've come from somewhere you understand me but you never give up until you see perfe in you you love the lord it's not about all the shouting I say it again it's not all about the dancing a preacher can come in here give you some deep Revelation exceptionally good but it'll do you no good if you don't ingest it if you don't say
