[0:17] it was in uh in
[0:20] uh actually in that's New York they at
[0:24] the women's Retreats I tried to say but
[0:28] the power of God come down just on the
[0:30] for seeing God move on that song

[0:48] Lord willing I hate saying that I'm GNA
[0:50] try to stop saying that cause I want to
[0:52] get away from all the
[0:54] Traditions I think that's one of the
[0:57] things that are that is uh Hind ing uh
[1:00] uh the the move of God uh it traditions
[1:04] and customs and whatever more but you
[1:08] know I was thinking about uh God today
[1:11] in heaven and uh I I you know I often
[1:14] wonder what it's going to be like
[1:17] because you know it's going to be so
[1:19] different from this
[1:21] place and you know I'm so
[1:24] glad that's the way it's going to be
[1:27] because I really would be disappointed
[1:30] if it was to be like this place I'm
[1:34] looking for a better City I'm looking
[1:36] for a greater
[1:39] City whose King is the Lord Jesus
[1:44] Christ let us turn to Malachi
[1:47] 4 and then we'll go to Hebrews

[2:42] thank God for that and uh everything
[2:45] went went really well uh brother

[3:07] even tell I'm like oh my God I think I
[3:09] studed the same messages but I don't go
[3:11] there but God is so good it was so
[3:14] wonderful people I'm telling you it it
[3:17] just no words can explain explain it
[3:20] it's just a time and season that we're
[3:22] living in Malachi
[3:26] 4 we're going to start reading by the
[3:28] grace of God uh
[3:35] 5-
[3:39] six Behold our sin you Elijah the
[3:41] prophet before the coming of the great
[3:44] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[3:47] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[3:49] the children and the hearts of the
[3:51] children to their fathers lest I come
[3:54] and smite the Earth with a
[3:57] curse okay let us turn to Hebrews 11
[4:04] please Hebrews 11th
[4:09] chapter 5ifth through sixth verses I've
[4:13] got somebody's Bible I don't know whose
[4:15] Bible it is but uh I'm using it and it's
[4:18] been really good so if you had a Bible
[4:21] like this I'm missing one there's no
[4:22] name in it lot of
[4:26] notes but anyhow by the grace of God let
[4:29] us turn to uh Hebrews 11th
[4:33] chapter we're going to read the fifth
[4:35] verse and sixth
[4:38] verse by faith Enoch was
[4:40] translated that he should not see death
[4:44] and was not found because God had
[4:47] translated him for before his
[4:49] translation he had this testimony that
[4:51] he plead God but without faith it is
[4:55] impossible to please him for he that
[4:59] cometh to God must first believe that he
[5:01] is and that he is a reward of them that
[5:04] diligently seek him let us pray father
[5:07] God we come before you Lord as humbly as
[5:09] we know how and we thank you for your
[5:11] grace we thank you for your mercy and
[5:13] your love we pray father that you will
[5:15] move upon the tabless of our hearts
[5:17] speak to your people Lord speak to us
[5:20] all we come father not because we are
[5:24] forced to come but it we come with a
[5:26] free will a free desire to love you and
[5:30] to know more of you and to hear directly
[5:32] from your throne father bless each and
[5:35] every heart here tonight forgive us
[5:37] father if there be anything we may have
[5:38] said or done throughout the day that
[5:40] would hinder your moving tonight cleanse
[5:43] us from all Wicked Ways and thoughts we
[5:46] ask these things in your precious and
[5:47] lovely name Jesus Christ amen you may be
[5:53] seated I'd like to uh entitle this
[5:55] message and I know you may not be able
[5:57] to uh think about which way I'm going
[5:59] with this at first but I like to uh
[6:02] entitle this message where are the
[6:07] Believers where are the
[6:11] Believers we understand by the grace of
[6:13] God that
[6:16] uh the word of God tells us without
[6:19] faith is impossible to please
[6:22] God we have come through seven Church
[6:26] ages we have come at a time when the
[6:30] earth is cursed not about to be cursed
[6:33] the Earth is cursed judgment is setting
[6:37] in rolling in and it's really picking up
[6:42] pace we realize we come in a time and
[6:46] brother bam described he said every
[6:48] messenger comes at the end of every
[6:52] age we realize by the grace of God that
[6:55] our Prophet came at the end of Leia not
[6:59] the beginning
[7:00] the
[7:01] end matter of fact in
[7:03] 5657 he preached a message H
[7:08] indictment and he indicted the United
[7:11] States uh uh for being guilty of
[7:14] crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ a
[7:17] second
[7:18] time we see by the grace of God and I
[7:21] want to bring things to your mind
[7:23] because the Bible tells us that Titus
[7:26] rode into Jerusalem 70 years after the
[7:30] death of Jesus
[7:32] Christ you see Jesus had already
[7:36] foretold that Jerusalem would be
[7:39] destroyed before his crucifixion he was
[7:42] there in the Mount of Olives crying out
[7:45] oh Jerusalem oh Jerusalem I would have
[7:49] hovered you as a chick in her Brew but
[7:52] you would not now we it is not a
[7:56] coincidence that we come to the same
[7:58] place in Los Angel
[8:00] and the same voice that called out on
[8:03] Mount in the Mount of Olives or uh there
[8:07] crying over Jerusalem is now crying over
[8:10] the United
[8:11] States and says oh uh capernium
[8:14] capernium Los Angeles Los Angeles I
[8:18] would have hovered You Now understand
[8:22] amen if there had not been a second
[8:25] crucifixion there would have never been
[8:27] another crying out for the people
[8:30] but here the same Holy Ghost is crying
[8:33] out or crying over the nation of America
[8:38] because we were founded or started just
[8:44] like the Jews
[8:46] were amen running and finding a place of
[8:50] for freedom of religion but now the
[8:54] whole America have basically turned
[8:56] their backs on God they want to do
[8:59] redefined him amen and and they want to
[9:03] forget about his laws they want to
[9:05] forget about his word and and when you
[9:07] become a lawless nation in which we have
[9:12] become we're in
[9:15] trouble as the prophet of God said if
[9:18] God don't judge America for her Deeds he
[9:23] will have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah
[9:26] and
[9:27] apologize and we'll be be that but oh my
[9:33] you and I are in a worse condition a
[9:36] more critical condition of our say
[9:39] because the Bible says to whom much is
[9:41] given much is
[9:43] required we have come in a place where
[9:47] God the Bible said God used to wink at
[9:49] ignorance but he no longer wik at
[9:51] ignorance why because the knowledge of
[9:53] the truth have been given but we took
[9:56] that same blood
[9:59] and we trampled it under our feet and I
[10:03] want to say by the grace of God I read
[10:06] those scriptures because I want to know
[10:09] where are the Believers now here we are
[10:11] in an age where the Bride of Jesus
[10:14] Christ is typed out as Enoch and the
[10:18] Bible said that Enoch so believed God he
[10:20] walked with God Amen and he had a
[10:22] testimony that he was
[10:25] translated think about it he was so
[10:28] walking in in the way that God wanted
[10:30] him to walk that he did not see death
[10:34] God took him and we had a prophet in our
[10:37] day that came and said the Bride of
[10:39] Jesus Christ is like Enoch matter of
[10:42] fact he said that she'd be so much like
[10:44] him amen that he she will literally pull
[10:47] him down out of
[10:50] heaven where are the
[10:52] Believers we find out that even in the
[10:54] days of Noah when he came what they did
[10:57] not know at the that Noah
[11:00] was uh one of the Major Prophets of of
[11:02] his day and and and and he come at the
[11:05] end where God had come to a place where
[11:07] he was sick and tired of sick and tired
[11:09] of being sick and tired if you want to
[11:11] say it he had put up uh with the people
[11:14] and their complaining and their
[11:15] murdering and their gambling and their
[11:17] stealing and their cheating and their
[11:19] hatred amen he had put up with that long
[11:22] enough and the Bible said that even so
[11:25] God it repented God that he made man but
[11:28] Noah found Grace you know it's got to be
[11:31] bad when the word of God has to put it
[11:33] in there like that that it repented God
[11:36] when god is
[11:38] perfect all right amen but you find out
[11:41] that God found one man by the name of
[11:44] Noah who had Faithfully kept his
[11:48] seed right his family amen perhaps was
[11:52] the only one left that was had married
[11:57] their own kind and I mean believe
[11:59] believer with a
[12:00] Believer y'all hear what I'm saying
[12:03] never mixed his seed with the world now
[12:06] we can't say that about his sons but
[12:08] Noah found Grace in the eyes of God
[12:12] hello somebody now we find out that if
[12:15] they had only been
[12:17] Believers and the Bible tells us that
[12:19] only eight Souls out of those Millions
[12:22] were saved I'm coming people because we
[12:25] realize that we're in a in in the same
[12:28] situation well you know what what Satan
[12:30] has done and let me put it this way
[12:32] Satan don't care if you come to church
[12:34] Satan don't care if you pay your tithes
[12:37] Satan don't care if you preach sing
[12:39] shout or whatever as long as you don't
[12:42] come as long as you don't get the Holy
[12:45] Ghost say he don't care he'll let you
[12:47] come Faithfully he'll let you be
[12:49] religious he'll let you be traditional
[12:52] he'll let you be whatever you want to be
[12:55] as long as you don't seek and receive
[12:58] the Holy Ghost he don't care he'll make
[13:01] you think you saved he'll make you think
[13:03] you're going to make a Rapture he'll
[13:06] make you think and listen if God would
[13:09] not accept a uh Cain's sacrifice without
[13:12] blood he's not going to accept your
[13:15] sacrifice without it
[13:17] either and the only blood that can be
[13:19] accepted in this day is the blood of
[13:22] Jesus Christ y'all hear what I'm saying
[13:25] now we look at this thing and I'm saying
[13:27] these things because we we people they
[13:29] they say we're Believers I'm a believer
[13:31] I'm a Believer but believing is more
[13:34] than singing shouting speaking in
[13:36] tongues you know the devil can do all of
[13:39] that but one thing I can say about the
[13:41] devil he is a
[13:44] Believer probably more of a Believer
[13:46] than some
[13:48] Christians the coming of the
[13:51] Lord is near where are the
[13:54] Believers you take a person like Rahab
[13:59] Rahab the Harlot who not had not even
[14:02] seen a
[14:03] miracle but had heard what God had done
[14:07] in
[14:07] Israel right the spies came and I'm
[14:11] going to tell you something what this
[14:12] message come to do do for us this
[14:14] message come to give us a total
[14:16] deliverance and I'm going tell you
[14:18] something you will not make a Rapture
[14:20] until you totally
[14:24] Delivered come on somebody that is the
[14:27] truth I don't know why people think they
[14:29] going to make it on 99 and a half but a
[14:32] 99 and a half won't won't do but anyway
[14:35] totally delivered now it didn't say you
[14:38] be free of temptation but totally
[14:40] delivered is that right come
[14:43] on the scripture tells us that we must
[14:47] be delivered totally delivered let's put
[14:50] it in This World Overcomers of the lust
[14:53] of the flesh the lust of the eye and the
[14:55] pride of
[14:56] life that's that's it
[14:59] and this message come to give us that
[15:02] now here the word of God tells us that
[15:04] that here uh Rahab she had a choice to
[15:07] make RAB had a choice she could have
[15:12] not hidden the spies or she could have
[15:15] exposed them but she heard that these
[15:21] people serve the true and living
[15:24] God now I want you to put yourself in
[15:27] rahab's position
[15:29] RAB I want to tell you something we're
[15:32] going to destroy
[15:34] all the
[15:36] inhabitants of
[15:40] Jericho now there's two ways of looking
[15:42] at it said but we're going to save you
[15:46] because she said all I ask of you is
[15:48] that you saved me in my
[15:50] house but I want you to see what God did
[15:53] for for uh H
[15:55] Rahab not only when he was destroying
[16:00] Jericho he destroyed her past
[16:04] reputation he destroyed all of her
[16:07] Witnesses oh come on somebody he
[16:10] destroyed all of her
[16:12] enemies hello he wiped out everything of
[16:16] rahab's
[16:18] past and she never had to look back and
[16:22] there was never one person who could say
[16:25] I know her
[16:29] from
[16:30] Jericho why amen God made sure her
[16:35] record was
[16:38] clean now that's the choice she made she
[16:41] made a choice because she didn't want to
[16:44] be halfway delivered she didn't want
[16:46] those same Devils coming back up in her
[16:49] life saying well oh you think you
[16:50] something now but I remember what you
[16:52] used to be she didn't want that she
[16:55] literally gave everything over now I
[16:57] want you to understand
[16:59] wasn't just rahab's family there Rahab
[17:02] had
[17:04] friends but I'm going to destroy your
[17:06] friends oh come on you cannot tell them
[17:10] what I'm got I'm going to
[17:12] do cuz the word would get out come on
[17:15] somebody Rahab God even separated her
[17:18] from her
[17:20] friends and some of us don't want to do
[17:23] that but if you want Total Deliverance
[17:26] because God knows what those old friends
[17:27] will make you do
[17:30] hello
[17:31] somebody amen the Bible said Enoch walk
[17:34] with God now think about it there was
[17:37] nobody other other than Enoch and God
[17:40] showing that in this last day it is a
[17:43] individual
[17:44] walk you and God and God
[17:48] alone right but he said don't worry
[17:51] you'll never be forsaken you'll never be
[17:54] alone I will always be with you even in
[17:56] you to the end of the Earth
[17:59] you know what we don't realize when it
[18:01] comes to being starch and stiff how God
[18:04] hates
[18:06] that he hates
[18:08] it he hates it we don't we don't we we
[18:12] we fail to see that you know we have
[18:14] fallen that Spirit of Le SE fight you
[18:17] every day every time you come to church
[18:20] that that same Le spir seal Spirit comes
[18:22] he gives you every reason not to move
[18:25] not to dance not to shout that ain't it
[18:27] ain't all that but Satan will make sure
[18:30] you come become stiff and
[18:33] starchy you don't even know it's
[18:36] happening and all he's trying to do is
[18:38] say you're
[18:41] dying you're
[18:43] dying right cooling the fire that God
[18:46] liveit you're dying and you don't even
[18:49] know it help us Lord listen it is the
[18:54] truth if you see how God orchestrated
[18:57] the things for Israel you'll realize
[19:00] that God when he coming to battle and
[19:02] whether you realize it or not this is a
[19:04] Battleground the greatest battles F in
[19:07] your mind but coming to church is a
[19:09] Battleground we are fighting demons and
[19:11] I'm the captain saying
[19:17] charge what happen if I got an army of
[19:20] people I'm said charge and you look
[19:22] around like you talking to
[19:24] me but that's the kind of response we
[19:27] get from people you go about your
[19:29] feelings I don't feel like it don't you
[19:31] know if you just raise your hand the
[19:33] anointing of God will come down and make
[19:34] you feel better now I'm a witness
[19:37] because I've been there I've seen it
[19:39] happen to me too many
[19:43] times you know let me tell you something
[19:45] what I hate I like I I I the internet is
[19:49] good and evil the internet is good and
[19:51] evil come on somebody now why you say
[19:54] that brother Brooks because I say it
[19:56] like this if I'm the pastor of the
[19:57] church
[20:02] right and I guarantee you most of you
[20:04] probably don't go home and listen to my
[20:06] message twice but you can go on the
[20:07] internet and you can flirt with another
[20:11] preacher because everybody else does it
[20:15] and you fail to see you can't have two
[20:18] heads and you fail to see that what that
[20:21] devil does is start like
[20:23] a like you're in a in in your intimacy
[20:27] it'll began to compare me
[20:29] oh come on somebody with the other
[20:33] man is not a good thing I'm telling you
[20:36] but we do it are
[20:40] there see Satan knows what he's doing
[20:43] now cuz one flock has one
[20:47] Shepherd there's not two or three
[20:49] Shepherds only
[20:51] one but we fail to see amen that when we
[20:55] do those things it's not pleasing God
[20:57] you might say oh I got something good so
[20:59] to
[21:04] E I hardly have the time enough to
[21:07] listen to brother brandom and I I try to
[21:08] do that almost every day but you know
[21:12] I'm just saying and I don't know that's
[21:13] not even my notes but I was made to
[21:15] throw it out
[21:16] anyhow now we look at this thing and we
[21:19] find out by the grace of God Amen that a
[21:21] lot of times we are playing with with
[21:24] with an enemy and we don't really know
[21:26] it why because you don't know if God
[21:30] ordained a man to be your pastor and you
[21:32] listening to somebody else you don't
[21:34] know whether he going to turn out to be
[21:35] a dayon or a
[21:37] caller hello Moses was their
[21:42] pastor and the 7 that God ordained Dayan
[21:45] and cor popped up guess what happened
[21:47] and caused their
[21:50] lives might be hard enough but I'll put
[21:53] it this way at least I know I'm giving
[21:55] you something that'll make get you
[21:56] crossed over amen if if you only
[21:59] listen if we only can find some people
[22:02] with some faith not only in God but in
[22:05] the man that God
[22:06] ordained she will not get anyway if you
[22:09] don't follow the leadership of the
[22:14] pastor come on somebody and it's true is
[22:17] that right I was thinking about that
[22:19] today I said I thank God for my wife you
[22:21] know we've come a mighty long way you
[22:23] know what I mean hello it's getting
[22:26] sweeter all the time
[22:29] but what kind of a man I would be if my
[22:31] wife ruled my
[22:33] house what kind of a man I would be if I
[22:36] let the church rule
[22:38] me
[22:40] hello confidence in what God is doing
[22:44] and has done come on somebody let me
[22:47] move on Hebrews 10 and you don't think
[22:49] I'm wrong try to stop it try to break
[22:53] those habits that you thought to be so
[22:56] good and so right let's see how
[22:59] difficult it becomes hello y'all don't
[23:02] hear me do
[23:05] you amen Hebrews 10
[23:10] 36 let's go to 35th verse cast not away
[23:14] therefore your confidence which have
[23:17] great recompense of reward for ye have
[23:19] need of patience that after you have
[23:21] done the will of God ye might receive
[23:24] the promise forget a little while and he
[23:27] that shall come will come and will not
[23:29] tarry I really believe that everybody in
[23:32] this in this place will truly have the
[23:33] full baptism of the Holy Ghost if you
[23:35] listen to your
[23:36] pastor but nobody want to listen you
[23:39] know why because you're set in your own
[23:41] ways and your own Traditions I don't
[23:43] have to go there why do God have me
[23:45] preaching it there do it sound like I'm
[23:48] fussing somewhat I
[23:51] am don't mean to be but my point is this
[23:56] the time of the coming of the Lord is so
[23:58] late and I can see the
[24:04] stragglers unbelief is written over
[24:06] everybody's face I can see when I say
[24:08] things that don't you don't you don't
[24:09] agree with and you reasoning in your
[24:11] mind I got a quote for
[24:14] you but my point is this if I'm the true
[24:18] man of God here and we going to go
[24:19] forward you got to
[24:23] listen come on it ain't me it's God in
[24:27] Me I can't take you nowhere but I'm
[24:29] instructed by the grace of God to say
[24:32] the things I say and do what I do why
[24:35] amen because amen it'll it'll take you
[24:38] in brother said that Pastor is ordained
[24:40] to see you
[24:41] through is that the message
[24:45] absolutely so I'm working hard and I
[24:48] think to myself I I was just thinking I
[24:51] said Lord I've offered that invitation
[24:53] so many times anybody who really want
[24:55] the Holy Ghost and want to come and pray
[24:57] through I come and pray with you I
[24:58] haven't got one person yet other than my
[25:02] wife I'm not asking anymore and you want
[25:06] God bad
[25:08] enough want some help I'm there to be
[25:11] your
[25:13] nurse cuz some people believe because of
[25:15] so many intellectual people somebody
[25:17] said to me the other day maybe I
[25:20] shouldn't say it but listen God didn't
[25:22] send me
[25:24] L God sent
[25:26] me Malachi
[25:30] and I can hear what Malachi 4 is saying
[25:33] CU that's Christ and Christ in that man
[25:36] I know the voice hello somebody oh y'all
[25:40] don't hear what I'm
[25:41] saying God didn't send me any bis or any
[25:45] of those people no
[25:47] sir y'all know what I'm saying I'm
[25:50] trying to tell you something listen if I
[25:53] know what I'm working with let me put it
[25:56] this way if he knows this B knows knew
[25:59] so much about the Holy Ghost why when
[26:01] the majority of the people the people
[26:02] that came to my church from his church
[26:04] after the split didn't even
[26:06] had years under that Ministry and never
[26:09] had
[26:13] it that's all I'm saying maybe they
[26:15] weren't listening either Hebrews 10 you
[26:18] know why why I'm ministering this
[26:20] because I want to go forward I want to
[26:23] be on one Accord y'all hear what I'm
[26:25] saying I want this little flock to be on
[26:27] one Accord it's such a shame we don't
[26:29] have as much I know some people may be
[26:31] still on vacation and whatever the case
[26:32] may be but we find out that it ain't
[26:35] going to do you no good to be
[26:36] ritualistically coming to church and not
[26:38] applying the word that's being preached
[26:41] it ain't going to happen it don't work
[26:44] that way now let me move on by the grace
[26:47] of God Hebrews 10:36 says for ye have
[26:50] need a patient that after you have done
[26:51] the will of God you might receive the
[26:54] promise for yet a little while and he
[26:56] that shall come will come and will not
[26:58] tar now the just shall live by faith but
[27:01] if any man draw back my soul have no
[27:03] pleasure in him but we are not of them
[27:05] who draw back into predition but of them
[27:08] that believe to the saving of the soul
[27:11] and I was thinking I said oh my I said
[27:13] it's amazing how we come with our own
[27:18] ideas I done heard so many people say
[27:20] well you know brother bam said you know
[27:22] we shouldn't wear mustaches because you
[27:24] know the angel of the Lord when he came
[27:27] to brother Bram didn't have a mustache
[27:29] so
[27:30] what do you think that got rais us in
[27:36] heaven you know if that be a sin when
[27:38] you go camping you don't have those
[27:41] tools to are you sinning then I heard
[27:45] somebody say don't you know I'm going
[27:46] tell you something when I was an
[27:47] evangelist there was a man who wouldn't
[27:49] even let me preach cuz I wore a
[27:51] mustache nowhere in the word then I
[27:54] heard somebody say brother brand said
[27:56] amen that you shouldn't cut your
[27:57] mustache because there's a vein up there
[27:59] and if you cut it you can bleed to death
[28:00] some kind of stuff but it's so many
[28:03] things that people say he said and you
[28:05] can't even find
[28:09] it hello I do know one thing he said
[28:12] kick the TV
[28:16] out and I think to myself I said Lord I
[28:19] mean come on folks how many years you
[28:21] had that television interview I don't
[28:23] know who all got them but let me put it
[28:26] this way far as I know of the way the
[28:27] holy the Holy Spirit spoke to me there's
[28:29] so many people in here who got them and
[28:32] don't think that they're hindering the
[28:34] services oh God help me kick it out
[28:38] suffer the pain of
[28:40] loss
[28:41] y you don't have to I'm I'm preaching
[28:44] the word and you can take it or leave it
[28:46] but my point is this amen if if that's a
[28:50] a a garment you know we can look at
[28:53] garments we can look at everything
[28:54] people wear and then we'll have a box
[28:57] right there that you think is so
[28:59] innocent when it's not and don't get me
[29:01] wrong the the the the the the Internet
[29:03] is just as bad or worse and if you don't
[29:06] have the Holy Ghost you going you going
[29:08] to go places where you shouldn't go and
[29:11] if that be the case you don't need the
[29:14] Internet hello somebody you'll be
[29:17] surprised that the people in this
[29:19] message struggling from pornography but
[29:21] they don't want to get to the altar
[29:23] they're too proud to Humble themselves
[29:25] oh come on
[29:29] you need the Holy Ghost now I'm saying
[29:32] this now because it's true it's true
[29:35] people don't want to labor anymore and
[29:37] they said well you don't have to do that
[29:39] well brother brandham said it let me put
[29:41] it way let me say it like this you go
[29:43] listen to your despiration message and
[29:45] your token message go listen and see
[29:48] what he say about it and then we'll see
[29:51] amen that it's going to take a
[29:54] desperation you listen it's the truth
[29:57] let me put it this way if I got shot in
[29:59] the arm with a bullet amen and that
[30:01] bullet now is enlarged in my arm and
[30:03] it's causing me a lot of pain and the
[30:05] doctor said can I take it out oh no I
[30:06] don't want you to take it
[30:08] out but isn't it causing you pain yes
[30:12] causes me pain why won't you don't you
[30:15] understand eventually that same bullet
[30:17] can cause blood poisoning and everything
[30:19] else infection why because is in you and
[30:23] it's not supposed to be there so is the
[30:25] television
[30:28] I'm just telling you just the way he
[30:30] told me to say it now we look at these
[30:33] things and you say well you know and and
[30:36] and I know how people
[30:38] struggle some of these movies you know
[30:41] look so
[30:42] innocent you know I I'm talking about
[30:45] sanctification people this message
[30:47] taught us how to be
[30:50] Sanctified now you can't get the Holy
[30:52] Ghost without being
[30:53] Sanctified that's just all to it now you
[30:56] said what do you mean the same blood of
[30:58] Jesus Christ that saved you it's the
[31:00] same blood of Jesus Christ that can
[31:02] sanctify you but God ain't going to push
[31:04] you he is not going to override your
[31:09] will come on somebody God will not
[31:13] override your will are there any
[31:14] believers in
[31:17] here that's all I'm saying God is not
[31:19] going to override your will God wants
[31:21] you to do something about it and if
[31:24] there's anything that's holding you that
[31:26] means there's devils in your life there
[31:27] has demons that has has has control over
[31:32] you your greatest confence should be in
[31:34] the Holy Ghost not in
[31:39] Hollywood I'm trying to tell us
[31:41] something why am I saying
[31:45] this Israel had a chance of being
[31:48] totally delivered just like Rahab now
[31:51] think about it
[31:53] now Israel comes over and we find Moses
[31:57] taking them over through the Red
[31:59] Sea and they look behind all their
[32:03] enemies are dead there's nobody to say I
[32:07] used to know what you used to be there
[32:09] was nobody to say I saw you and I know
[32:12] the kind of you're evil I saw no there
[32:15] was nobody there to say there was nobody
[32:17] who heard you cursing and drinking and
[32:19] smoking and doping and there was nobody
[32:22] everything was dead everything died
[32:26] there was no Witnesses
[32:29] and that's what dying to Christ do does
[32:33] it brings you to a place where there's
[32:35] no more witnesses left Paul said the
[32:37] things I used to do I don't do no more
[32:40] it's not I that live but Christ that
[32:42] lives in me come on but what happened to
[32:46] Israel God comes and justifies them in
[32:49] the Red Sea baptize them under Moses
[32:52] bring him into the Wilderness to be
[32:53] Sanctified see what I'm saying God can't
[32:56] sanctify you as long as as long as you
[32:58] murmuring and complain see every time
[33:00] God tried to get the Devils away from
[33:03] them they wanted to hold on to the
[33:05] Devils you see what I'm saying every
[33:07] move God made they were complaining
[33:10] because they did not like the way he was
[33:12] leading them ain't that right a't that
[33:15] the way it works amen it's it's there on
[33:18] the job is everywhere people always
[33:20] complain about leadership but you know
[33:22] what you don't know what it's like until
[33:23] you get there
[33:25] yourself they will always fine fault in
[33:27] leadership but understand these
[33:29] leaderships these positions have been
[33:32] you have been placed under these
[33:34] leadership for what character
[33:38] building whether you like it or not God
[33:41] put you
[33:42] there my point is this they had the
[33:46] opportunity but what happened the Bible
[33:48] said they began to think about what it
[33:50] was like in Egypt isin't that the way
[33:53] the devil come God brings you all the
[33:55] way up Amen to a place in your life life
[33:58] and then he get you to a rough spot and
[34:00] start make he'll make you reminisce of
[34:03] what you on the things you thought were
[34:05] so good in Egypt it never was good in
[34:09] Egypt but the devil will make you think
[34:11] it was good and when he began to make
[34:15] them think it was good they started
[34:17] screaming out to Moses what did you do
[34:19] you CA call us out here to to die oh no
[34:23] the message people listen we don't have
[34:25] these big great churches we can't have
[34:27] have all these big uh conventions and
[34:29] all of the things that everybody else is
[34:31] doing we don't know how to do that we're
[34:33] not ordained to do that we were called
[34:35] for one purpose and that is to make
[34:38] yourself ready for a
[34:40] Rapture want to put it this way make
[34:42] yourself for a wedding brother Brandon
[34:44] preached a message total deliverance and
[34:46] that's what God is requiring from all of
[34:48] us and if we don't get enough we don't
[34:50] get desperate enough we'll be left
[34:52] behind and this same message right here
[34:55] will be playing in your ear
[34:58] you know brother B said it he said your
[35:00] own soul will preach against
[35:03] you your own soul let me read this thing
[35:06] let me read
[35:07] this coming from the spoken word is
[35:09] Original Seed he said I'm told that if
[35:12] we could pick up an instrument that
[35:15] catch it that a man's voice my voice
[35:18] that I speak today uh 10,000 years from
[35:23] now you could still be picked it could
[35:26] still be picked up in in the air like
[35:28] dropping a petal in the middle of a pond
[35:31] and the teeny little waves after they
[35:35] fail to be seen by the eyes continue on
[35:39] till it hits the bank and the air waves
[35:43] our voice continually to water around
[35:45] and around the world therefore then our
[35:49] voice what we say will be our judgment
[35:53] Our Testimony will rise up against us
[35:56] our own voice voices will echo in our
[35:59] own ears at the Judgment bar of God when
[36:04] his great instruments catches every
[36:06] voice that's been spoke every word
[36:10] that's been muttered Now understand this
[36:13] we didn't know it but the prophet God
[36:15] comes along and tells us that our what
[36:17] we think our thoughts are louder in
[36:20] heaven than our words so even your
[36:23] thoughts will be
[36:25] caught oh yes Lucifer you said in your
[36:30] heart right Jesus at Simon's house amen
[36:34] discern his thoughts he didn't speak it
[36:37] with his lips but the same God spoke it
[36:40] out why because he heard
[36:42] him right now no matter what I preach
[36:45] every thought you're thinking is being
[36:48] recorded whether you receiving it or
[36:50] whether you rejecting it it ain't
[36:51] between me and you it's between you and
[36:54] God and now there's only one way to stop
[36:57] that voice that's
[36:59] wrong that's
[37:03] repent you say and and I I just got to
[37:06] say it like this because a lot of time
[37:07] people don't think ministers affect you
[37:09] but they do affect you they affect your
[37:11] way of thinking they affect your way of
[37:13] worship that affects all these things
[37:16] and and let me say like this I had a
[37:18] brother right there when I went to
[37:19] Brother Samuel uh Fields there his own
[37:22] son 20 something years old 30 something
[37:24] years old left the message denied it but
[37:27] because he's been listening to
[37:32] PCF another brother amen all the way
[37:35] from England his Pastor was a his daddy
[37:37] was a pastor the same thing what is it
[37:40] they didn't know that thing was grabbing
[37:41] them they didn't know at the time there
[37:44] was a a hook of unbelief riding in their
[37:48] hearts and then when the opportunity
[37:50] came it
[37:51] happened right so that's why I say you
[37:54] got to be really really careful right
[37:57] listen and now there's only one way to
[38:00] step that uh stop that voice that's
[38:02] wrong that's repent y'all hear what I'm
[38:05] saying the only way to stop that voice
[38:07] all that negativity thing that we've
[38:09] been uttering and thinking and all of
[38:11] these things he said the only way to get
[38:12] rid of that God is the only way could do
[38:14] it and he said that is to
[38:17] repent right repent God Alone can stop
[38:21] it if it doesn't it'll go on and meet up
[38:25] with with you in the eternity therefore
[38:28] God being perfect and his voice Eternal
[38:31] his own voice will have to catch up with
[38:34] it therefore he must be perfect in every
[38:38] decision for when he once says something
[38:41] it has to go all the way and come back
[38:44] to the Judgment in other words God's Own
[38:46] word will be caught up with him
[38:50] everything Jesus Christ said will come
[38:52] up with him and that word will judge
[38:55] every one of us
[39:00] you say the bride ain't being judged she
[39:02] won't be come at the Judgment that's
[39:03] because judgment now is at the house of
[39:09] God you say oh brother books you be
[39:11] preaching trying to get us all emot
[39:12] emotional I wish I
[39:14] could I really wish I could but you know
[39:17] what it won't work before God because
[39:19] everything is willfully will you must
[39:21] will you must will it must be a will in
[39:24] you right listen what he say says it
[39:28] wasn't so from the beginning John Wesley
[39:31] he would turn over in his grave tonight
[39:34] if he know the Methodist Church getting
[39:36] formed and back to the uh to the
[39:38] tradition of men instead of staying with
[39:41] that word and you Baptist you need to
[39:44] hit a sawdust Trail too John Smith
[39:47] prayed until this all night and wept for
[39:50] sins over the people till his wife had
[39:53] to lead him around to the table of them
[39:56] to the table of the of the the morning
[39:57] to give him something to eat and feed
[39:59] him with a
[40:01] spoon anybody ever been there you done
[40:04] prayed all night till your eyes are
[40:05] swollen and matted together you can't
[40:07] even find your way through the through

[40:17] smoking cigarettes carrying on oh John
[40:20] Smith that great Methodist when he come

[40:28] and you can't listen to a 20
[40:30] minute when he was 80 years old and said
[40:34] it Grieves my heart to

[41:34] whatever the case may be I mean we're so
[41:36] afraid that we we can't shout and dance
[41:38] too much because that's going to be the
[41:40] world I don't know what you're talking
[41:41] about my Prophet told me that Satan got

[41:46] church we we danced before he even
[41:49] thought about

[43:42] Israel what's happening to you well I
[43:44] know a Revival coming people of
[43:49] God the kingdom of God the Bible said
[43:51] must be pressed
[43:53] into you can't just oh don't you realize
[43:57] if it was hard for you yesterday what is
[43:59] going to be for you today the day before
[44:01] a day after brother said every day every
[44:05] day it gets harder way in the 60s he
[44:07] said if you don't believe it he said
[44:09] it's going to get harder to receive the
[44:11] holy ghost in the 60s what about
[44:14] now it's hard why because people are
[44:17] busy they don't they say they love God
[44:20] they want to make a Rapture but they
[44:21] don't want to get on their knees they
[44:23] don't have time to pray
[44:30] we got time for everything but prayer
[44:33] why cuz we sensual we want to we want to
[44:36] feel it oh I got to feel it you might
[44:38] feel it but you need to let God know I'm
[44:42] here and I need you
[44:45] Lord Brother said until you get
[44:47] desperate like that old man said Lord he
[44:49] said you going to give me the holy ghost
[44:51] or when you come back by here you going
[44:52] to find find a pile of
[44:54] bones yeah but but so many of we don't
[44:57] want to leave your oh I'm going to be
[44:59] left behind come back for me
[45:02] tomorrow y'all understand me I don't
[45:04] think y'all understand me I'm saying
[45:05] when it come to prayer when God gets a
[45:08] hold of you in this place I don't care
[45:09] if who got to go you stay here till it's
[45:13] done y'all hear what I'm saying I've
[45:15] been that way I've been in prayers it's
[45:17] been so wonderful amen and everybody
[45:20] go then the devil said well you might as
[45:22] well get up too no no more no more no
[45:25] more my point is amen when God is in the
[45:28] building I'm going to stay there stay
[45:29] there like Jacob did I wrestle with the
[45:31] angel till I'm
[45:34] blessed I know I'm telling you I'm
[45:37] trying to tell you it's later than what
[45:39] you
[45:40] think 1 Peter 2 I'm sorry four first
[45:44] Peter
[45:54] 4 1 Peter 4 69 n you know why I I I put
[46:00] this way
[46:02] folks if a child has to be born under a
[46:05] certain condition or egg has to be
[46:08] hatched under a certain
[46:11] heat you think it's in here
[46:14] now do you really think the atmosphere
[46:18] is charged up enough for somebody to get
[46:21] the Holy Ghost if they desired it
[46:23] absolutely
[46:25] not huh
[46:27] and that's the only way a real birth can
[46:29] come that's one thing I could say people
[46:32] well the Pentecostal didn't get the Holy
[46:33] Ghost yes they did they just didn't get
[46:36] it all to the soul because they didn't
[46:38] have the word to take it
[46:40] there many of them got it in their
[46:44] Spirit but they did not have the word to
[46:47] take them to the Holy Holy that's what
[46:49] made this message different it took you
[46:52] out of the living room into the bedroom
[46:55] in the Pentecostal realm you just in the
[46:57] living
[46:59] room kitchen however you want to put it
[47:02] but my point is they got it like Rebecca
[47:07] got the
[47:08] gifts but they didn't get the giver who
[47:11] is Isaac and they weren't willing and
[47:14] ready to ride that humpback
[47:17] camel you know what a humpback camel you
[47:19] go up and down up and down that's how it
[47:21] is in prayer but I'm going to tell you
[47:23] something it'll show take you there if
[47:24] you ride it long enough huh
[47:27] huh you ride it long enough it'll take
[47:30] you right to
[47:31] Isaac 1 Peter 4 ah my heart goes
[47:36] out first Peter
[47:39] 46 you got it for this call was the
[47:44] Gospel preached also to them that are
[47:46] dead they got it
[47:50] right yeah
[48:01] well that's a good one though let's keep
[48:03] going amen wherein they think it's
[48:05] strange that you run not with them to
[48:07] the same excess of Riot speaking evil of
[48:09] you who should give account to him that
[48:12] is ready to judge the quick and the dead
[48:14] for this cause was the Gospel preached
[48:16] also to them that are dead that they
[48:18] might be judged according to men in the
[48:19] flesh but live according to God in the
[48:22] spirit but the end of all things is at
[48:25] hand be be ye therefore sober and watch
[48:29] where unto
[48:33] prayer of All Above All Things Have
[48:36] fervent charity among
[48:39] yourselves for charity shall cover the
[48:41] multitude of
[48:43] sin is that right because when the
[48:46] atmosphere is not charge people when
[48:49] you're not bubbling over when you know
[48:52] that atmosphere let me tell you
[48:53] something I don't care what your
[48:55] problems are if a person you yourself
[48:57] comeing this church and the serums are
[49:00] really going and the power of God is in
[49:01] the building you it lights you
[49:04] up it just lights you up why that
[49:07] atmosphere has been created but it ain't
[49:11] all the song Leader's fault either y'all
[49:14] hear what I'm
[49:18] saying now it is my point is this amen
[49:23] the time is at hand the Bible say that
[49:26] you're a chosen generation you're a
[49:29] royal priesthood is that all right amen
[49:33] so what happened we're looking at time
[49:35] I'm just saying are there any believers
[49:37] we say we Believers but brother B said
[49:39] if you can't live it you're not
[49:40] believing
[49:41] it you say you believe it but because
[49:44] but you're not living
[49:47] it huh and if you're not living it
[49:50] you're not a
[49:53] Believer potentially you are come on
[49:55] somebody no this is not a Hallelujah
[49:58] message but I tell you what if you can
[50:00] listen and hear the spirit what the
[50:02] spirit say to the church you'll be
[50:04] blessed in
[50:07] it we can't hardly do trials oh Lord we
[50:11] just we just let the devil beat us all
[50:13] up in Trials don't we and the Bible
[50:16] tells us amen the First Peter 1 and7 the
[50:19] tri the trial of your faith being more
[50:21] precious than gold that's perishes
[50:24] though it be tried with fire might be
[50:26] found to praise and honor and Glory at
[50:28] the peing of Jesus Christ you got to
[50:32] suffer and the thing about it is you
[50:34] don't say what the Lord done curse me no
[50:36] no no no the Bible said he's blessing
[50:39] you you're going through these trials to
[50:41] be blessed not curse and we need to
[50:44] learn how to praise God in all time now
[50:48] I know sometime it's
[50:50] difficult but I believe the truth
[50:54] greater is he that is in you
[50:58] than he that is in the
[51:00] world think about it we want the Holy
[51:02] Ghost listen St John 6:49 and I'm going
[51:05] to be long tonight your fathers did eat
[51:07] Mana in the wilderness and are
[51:11] dead why why they dead because the Bible
[51:15] tells us According to Hebrew four I
[51:17] believe it is they wouldn't mix the
[51:19] things they heard with
[51:21] faith they heard it all they heard it
[51:24] right but they wouldn't put the faith
[51:26] out there
[51:28] they wouldn't they wouldn't jump out of
[51:30] the boat and says Lord I'm
[51:31] coming right come he
[51:34] says Peter got out of the boat and he
[51:37] started walking he took the
[51:42] risk and that's what faith does faith
[51:45] would take risk all the time because
[51:47] first of all Faith don't even look at
[51:49] the
[51:50] risk Faith just jumps right into it and
[51:52] moves with
[51:54] it now the Bible said he that come to
[51:56] God must first believe that he is what
[51:59] God and that he's a reward of them that
[52:01] D diligently seek him that's
[52:04] right you got to believe this word Is
[52:10] God When You Believe the word is God you
[52:13] know where you place it not here not
[52:16] here not even here this is not the aim
[52:18] I'm working with you placeing here above
[52:21] all
[52:22] things y'all understanding now I'm
[52:25] working with this and I'm working with
[52:27] principalities and power you understand
[52:29] me he is the head of the church that's
[52:31] what I'm working with he is the head
[52:33] above all things he is the head of the
[52:36] church so if he's the head of the church
[52:38] that means he's Above This above your
[52:41] head right so my point is when God
[52:45] becomes the
[52:46] word right what if I
[52:49] say that's supposing I'm I'm God and I
[52:52] you know what I mean but let's just say
[52:54] I give you an order stand right here
[52:56] till I come back now didn't God do that
[52:59] one time
[53:00] before he told Saul you be stay right
[53:04] here till I get back I'm coming now I'm
[53:06] coming but don't you do nothing I'll be
[53:07] right
[53:09] back Saul within his reason and said
[53:12] well I know he going to take a while so
[53:13] I'll just move on out of here and do it
[53:18] myself and that's where we mess
[53:21] up all he had to do is wait for
[53:24] Samuel Samuel was going to do the
[53:27] sacrifice he never would have lost his
[53:30] kingdom he never would have had to
[53:33] die all history would have been changed
[53:36] only if he had only been
[53:41] obedient what if God would have told
[53:43] those disciples you te there into
[53:46] Jerusalem till I come till you be endued
[53:48] with power brother man said they tried
[53:50] it for those 10 days is that him is this
[53:53] him that's you know they wanted to know
[53:55] no that ain't him you know they but they
[53:57] stayed there they weren't running in and
[54:00] out of the church like a lot of people
[54:01] do here religious Le people don't even
[54:06] have to go to the restroom and they walk
[54:09] out there are some of us who have to but
[54:12] there's some of us who don't y'all hear
[54:14] what I'm saying it is what it is but
[54:16] people don't understand the Holy Ghost
[54:18] is so sensitive to those things affect
[54:21] the move of God in this
[54:25] church I've ask people to give me
[54:27] nominations for deacons I ain't seen
[54:29] nothing yet except for one
[54:36] person now y'all I I'll be honest with
[54:38] you people of God God has an order he
[54:41] has a stru it ain't about what you think
[54:43] about it is what God is leading me to do
[54:46] but we can't find nobody we can't find
[54:48] the people say okay let's get behind the
[54:50] pastor let's move on we won't move until
[54:52] people
[54:53] submit not to me to God if they can
[54:57] trust a
[55:09] Ministry I heard somebody say the other
[55:12] day went is so true you know and I don't
[55:14] think we you know we we we we we've
[55:16] dealt with tight skirts we dealt with
[55:19] splits we've dealt with high heels we
[55:21] dealt with we we you know I don't think
[55:23] nobody cutting hairir but cutting hair
[55:25] but you know what all the message people
[55:27] are still doing it and they say they're
[55:34] Believers what are
[55:36] you you know why I'm working with this
[55:38] because I'm trying to pinpoint you as an
[55:40] individual I'm saying all these things
[55:43] because I want you to think about are
[55:44] you truly a
[55:46] Believer are you truly a believer of
[55:49] this message because that's the only way
[55:51] you gonna get out of here is to be a
[55:53] really true a true true true
[55:59] believer amen second Peter
[56:02] please the last
[56:06] scripture even Jesus said this is that
[56:08] bread which came down from heaven not as
[56:10] your fathers did eat mana and are dead
[56:14] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[56:17] forever and this is what scares me
[56:19] because everybody can see what God did
[56:21] to Israel but they don't believe it's
[56:23] happening to them they don't even
[56:25] believe it they they can't even see they
[56:27] eat mana and they're not living huh
[56:30] because of unbelief you you can eat all
[56:32] the Mana you want you can eat all the
[56:34] word you want but you're not living
[56:35] because of your it can't live because of
[56:37] unbelief it Faith must be
[56:44] applied Amen brother Brooks that's the
[56:46] best service I've heard you preach in a
[56:47] long time
[56:59] that felt good to
[57:00] me I might have to do that more often
[57:04] but here it is second Peter the thir
[57:07] chapter people my point is this I
[57:09] wouldn't preach this message tonight if
[57:11] I didn't care I'm not trying to get in
[57:13] your
[57:15] business huh that's between you and God
[57:18] but I have to do his
[57:20] business I'm called to do his business
[57:24] and I'm doing his business if you got a
[57:27] problem you have to talk it over with
[57:31] him y'all hear what I'm saying don't go
[57:33] home that brother Brook said did the
[57:35] word say it did brother bandam say the
[57:37] things I'm
[57:40] saying okay so if if that be true then
[57:43] what God is trying to do for you take
[57:45] you to the next level you cannot be
[57:48] spiritual being part of the world
[57:51] brother bam said God would judge us for
[57:55] doing those things and even having
[57:57] pleasure of with those who do it so you
[58:00] don't even have to do it but when you
[58:02] home or in the street or whever you
[58:04] doing and you having pleasure with the
[58:06] world God hate that you could be doing
[58:08] it just in your
[58:10] mind god holds you guilty for
[58:13] it second Peter
[58:16] 3 you know what I heard the other day
[58:18] when I was down there they say
[58:20] scientifically they have proven that
[58:23] when you look at television it causes
[58:26] dark spots in your brain and then it
[58:28] also causes your brain to
[58:31] shrink is a new scientific discovery I
[58:35] said no wonder people
[58:37] insane no wonder people are going crazy
[58:40] cuz everybody watches TV and you're
[58:43] sinful if you
[58:46] don't go look it up that's what I heard
[58:49] last week I'm like wow that sounds about
[58:52] right
[58:56] second Peter 3
[58:58] 3-9 knowing that the first let me ask
[59:01] you a question since y'all let me ask
[59:03] you whether it make no difference it's
[59:05] like this brother R said if you see a
[59:08] woman and you
[59:10] know that first look you turn like I
[59:13] heard a brother say you know what the
[59:15] problem is y'all know it's just only one
[59:17] look but you look a long
[59:20] time and that's just as
[59:23] bad that's just as bad you got to make a
[59:26] your mind now I'm on turn you done
[59:28] already did what you're supposed to
[59:36] do second Peter
[59:41] 33:9 knowing this first that there
[59:44] should come in the last days scoffers
[59:47] walking after their own lust and saying
[59:50] where is the promises of his coming for
[59:53] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[59:55] continue as they were from the beginning
[59:57] of cre of the creation Now ain't that
[59:59] the same kind of attitude that they took
[1:00:01] that when Moses was up on the mountain
[1:00:03] 40 days where is Moses he been up there
[1:00:06] 40 days he probably dead now right the
[1:00:10] same kind of attitude and look what's
[1:00:12] happening Among
[1:00:16] Us close friend of mine died either
[1:00:19] today or yesterday I just got the news
[1:00:22] today and his Pastor was one of the p
[1:00:27] that deny the
[1:00:30] father my precious brother was right
[1:00:33] there when he was trying to explain to
[1:00:35] me that brother Brandon wasn't Elijah my
[1:00:39] day and now he's gone and cross the
[1:00:42] cabin I I don't know where he's at all I
[1:00:45] could think about today was Lord God I
[1:00:48] don't know what what was in his heart
[1:00:50] but I surely hope at some point in time
[1:00:52] God calls him to repent if there was a
[1:00:54] place to repent
[1:00:59] a friend of mine called me the other day
[1:01:01] he said was 17 18 years old just
[1:01:03] graduated from high
[1:01:05] school a real Christian boy in a
[1:01:08] denominational church and I believe God
[1:01:10] still works with
[1:01:12] me but his mama said but boy I got you
[1:01:15] going to college he said I ain't going
[1:01:17] to college mama I'm going home she said
[1:01:20] home she she said yeah God don't show me
[1:01:22] I'm going to heaven he coming for me I'm
[1:01:24] not going
[1:01:26] I'm not going to
[1:01:30] college and here this boy was trying to
[1:01:32] tell his mom I think he dropped dead in
[1:01:34] church just dead
[1:01:37] boom there was no the the the the the
[1:01:40] the the they did the autopsy said no
[1:01:42] hard failure they just he just died of
[1:01:44] natural causes boom his hard just
[1:01:47] stopped but he had been telling them for
[1:01:49] weeks that God was going to take him
[1:01:52] home and nobody believed him
[1:01:57] nobody believed him and then all of a
[1:01:59] sudden he
[1:02:02] just all his mama could do was cry and
[1:02:04] say but my Lord my good child why take
[1:02:08] my good child you know just like brother
[1:02:10] randam said he said these people
[1:02:11] disappearing he said how do you know the
[1:02:13] Rapture is not taking place now you ever
[1:02:16] heard him
[1:02:17] saying we don't know how God is going to
[1:02:20] do it he said but all these people
[1:02:21] disappearing how do you know the Rapture
[1:02:24] is not taking place now
[1:02:27] people don't even know where they
[1:02:30] are let me hurry this is my last
[1:02:34] scripture and saying where is the
[1:02:36] promise of his coming for since the
[1:02:38] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[1:02:39] as they were from the beginning of the
[1:02:41] creation but this call they willingly
[1:02:43] are ignorant of that by the word of God
[1:02:46] the heavens were made were of old and
[1:02:48] the Earth standing out of the water and
[1:02:50] in the water whereby the world that then
[1:02:52] was being overflowed with water perish
[1:02:56] you know how you
[1:02:57] overcome ah I don't care if it's one
[1:02:59] thing at a time you got to knock on
[1:03:02] God's door until he gets right you got
[1:03:05] to knock on God I mean really cry
[1:03:09] out because every one of us has to be a
[1:03:11] to it must be a total Deliverance people
[1:03:14] you can't have the world in you and God
[1:03:16] at the same time brother B said it
[1:03:17] doesn't exist a speck of the world he
[1:03:20] said the love of God is not in
[1:03:22] you but the devil will make you think he
[1:03:25] is
[1:03:27] whereby the world that was was was uh
[1:03:30] being overflowed with water perish but
[1:03:32] the heavens and the Earth which are now
[1:03:34] by the same word are kept in store
[1:03:36] reserved unto fire against the day of
[1:03:38] judgment and predition of ungodly
[1:03:41] men now he ain't just saying sat he's
[1:03:44] saying ungodly men that were once were
[1:03:46] Godly are supposed to be Godly were
[1:03:48] ungodly right the Lord is not slack
[1:03:51] concerning his promise as some men count
[1:03:53] slackness but is longsuffering to usw
[1:03:56] not willing that any should perish but
[1:03:59] that all should come to
[1:04:02] repentance so you see I'm I'm working
[1:04:04] here tonight and I I want to read one
[1:04:06] more quote before I let you
[1:04:10] go you know I don't want to suffer Lord
[1:04:13] we don't want to suffer Lord I mean why
[1:04:15] are we going through all of these
[1:04:17] things and I always tell the people I
[1:04:19] say you going through it because you
[1:04:20] asked for
[1:04:22] it you asked for it Lord I want to be
[1:04:24] just like you
[1:04:26] right I want to be just like
[1:04:34] you and I don't it's like this people of
[1:04:37] God when it comes down to God to
[1:04:43] Moses you think about it millions
[1:04:47] millions millions milons of people
[1:04:53] died and only two out of that
[1:04:56] because they saw beyond the Flesh of mes
[1:04:59] and they saw God did Moses make mistakes
[1:05:02] yes but they heard and had the ability
[1:05:05] to hear God coming from beond
[1:05:11] flesh and it comes right back down to
[1:05:14] the very simple fact when Jesus said my
[1:05:18] sheep Hearth my voice and the Strang
[1:05:21] that they will
[1:05:24] not you can say all you want to but I
[1:05:27] say it like
[1:05:28] this I haven't even considering myself
[1:05:33] basically just stopping the internet
[1:05:35] service that we have because you know
[1:05:37] what I don't want to confuse
[1:05:42] nobody I didn't say I would I said I've
[1:05:44] been
[1:05:45] considering because I don't want nobody
[1:05:47] comparing me with their
[1:05:50] Pastor I don't give it out pretty much
[1:05:52] anywhere until I unless it's somebody I
[1:05:54] know who don't have
[1:05:57] service but y'all understand me or
[1:05:59] somebody that really
[1:06:01] needed y' getting quiet
[1:06:03] on that I wasn't commissioned to do that
[1:06:06] we weren't I just put it this way it
[1:06:09] comes by real
[1:06:13] preaching only believe oh I'm so glad
[1:06:16] tonight I'm so glad tonight to know that
[1:06:20] there's a circumcision of the heart that
[1:06:23] God will cut away all the world
[1:06:26] and all the tradition of men and
[1:06:29] everything else and we can see Jesus and
[1:06:32] see him standing there in a pill of fire
[1:06:35] going before performing The Works and
[1:06:38] doing exactly what God Said would do and
[1:06:41] bring a church filled with the Holy
[1:06:44] Ghost and doing the works that he said
[1:06:47] I'm glad tonight I the happiest person
[1:06:51] in this world because of it because he
[1:06:54] promised it
[1:06:56] and won't it be a sad
[1:06:58] thing if we get just like I tell people
[1:07:01] I
[1:07:03] said Being Born Again is one thing and
[1:07:06] coming to Perfection is
[1:07:10] another you heard the messages preached
[1:07:13] on adoption y'all think God kidding with
[1:07:15] it God means exactly what he says and he
[1:07:17] says what he
[1:07:19] means and adoption amen comes to the
[1:07:22] place brother Brandon described it when
[1:07:25] when a Son of God come to the place he's
[1:07:27] adopted he tells Heaven hear ye
[1:07:33] him and I tell you what I say it like
[1:07:36] this how on Earth you going to grow up
[1:07:39] to be a perfect Son of God if when if

[1:07:49] the message I think it's yesterday uh
[1:07:52] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:07:54] forever he said there have been no other
[1:07:57] time or no other age where the sons of
[1:08:01] God can be made Manifest this is the age
[1:08:05] of the manifestations of the sons of God
[1:08:08] this is the age that where the whole
[1:08:11] creation have been groaning to see and
[1:08:15] you and I we say we're true Sons and
[1:08:18] Daughters of God then we ought to be
[1:08:19] about our father's business what do you
[1:08:22] mean I don't say it like this not on
[1:08:25] your knees growing standing laying in
[1:08:31] the presence of the son where Jesus
[1:08:34] Christ the word becomes your main
[1:08:37] priority nothing
[1:08:40] else some of us will make it and some of
[1:08:43] us
[1:08:45] won't some of us will take it seriously

[1:09:55] what I never too much like that bracet
[1:09:57] what would Jesus do but sometime I think
[1:09:59] about
[1:10:00] it if you got the Holy Ghost he'll tell
[1:10:02] you what he'll
[1:10:04] do right and I think about it I say you
[1:10:07] think about all the things you do and
[1:10:09] question yourself would Jesus
[1:10:13] do and if your answers are no that means
[1:10:15] you got to get rid of
[1:10:19] it
