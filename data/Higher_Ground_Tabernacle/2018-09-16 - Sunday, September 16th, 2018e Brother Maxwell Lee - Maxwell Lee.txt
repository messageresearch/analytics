possession over on the streets of what we deem are greedy Oh amen then the redeemed are gathering in scenes of God you wanna shout and you gotta sing Alleluia the songwriters say there be shouting on the hills of glory and saints of God it's not long from now you know every every platform is being set raise God that we can enter praise God you know even if he says enter in that's is enough for us Alleluia know myself a rod as fellowshipping the other day and he said you know if even if you don't hear my good and faithful just to know that you have entered in you know that's a privilege by the grace of God because so many time you have missed the mark and we have displeased God the saints of God when God save you it's not by the skin of your teeth hallelujah but his amazing grace and we truly thank God that we can be back in his house again for worship and fellowship and you know the product God says there must be worship in the fellowship if you don't know what his fellows come into the fellowship you can't worship because they're at worship God must worship God in spirit and in truth and we truly thank God for grace this evening you may be seated that we can be in a house of a heavenly father and every time you come into his house god it's for correction it's for reproof it's for rebuke is faro healing because we come to realize that this is God's provided way for his God that we can get closer to him and many times we say that when we come into the house of God down the road as they walked on the road to Emmaus he said did not our hearts burn within us while he yet speak we don't want something to tickle our ears and we want something to come into our soul that when we leave here we must have an experience with God hallelujah and to have an experience with God is a life that lived and we truly appreciate the grace of God and made on this services evening is the communion service and the come to realize that this is one of the commission that Christ Jesus has given to us before he is he had left the scene and he said this is the last time that I will take you that you what you continue to do it that when I come again in my father's Kingdom that we all be together and saints of God the Word of God tells us that you know happy are he if he do these things and you know this is a commandment that we have receive and we thank God for grace that it's a privilege to wash each other's feet by the grace of God and you know it's a kindred spirit and we thank God for this opportunity that we can be here this evening in the presence of a Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and wherever the presence of God is there is Liberty we are a liberated people and we truly thank God for grace you know I don't know how long the service goes but you know back home sometimes or communion service go to four or five hours and this is a different thing that's a time you know the presence of God comes down and you know we thank God for His grace but back home and we have in communion service we don't have the morning service because the believers they come from far the time you spend there by 10:00 we go home and come back again but we thank God for grace that it's always to be in the presence of a mighty God praise God let us all go stand together as we turn into our Bibles in the book of Acts chapter 2 reading from verses 1 through out for the Word of God tells us here Acts chapter 2 reading from verses 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly they came a song from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled a house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire mean they broken up into many fish and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance we could go to verses 14 but Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them he men of Judah and all he that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as he supposed see it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel hallelujah gracious God and Heavenly Father Lord we so thank you for your word this day Lord that we can come in your presence Lord to lift you out of history Lord we know that you're a great and mighty God that is unveiled before us Lord and as we come in your presence Lord to lift our history we pray that you may have your way amongst us Lord to give you all the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name Amen praise God you may be seated I just would like to speak on a little thought this afternoon and the promise of the Father and we know that we all have received a promise and to receive the promise the prophet of God tells us it is the atmosphere what brings the result so even if something is being promised on to you if you don't have the right attitude you can never receive it because you know that what we say goes a long way if you have it as a father you having your children and you may have things that you want to give them and you know but you're looking at the attitude and I believe that this afternoon that God is looking at your attitude and my attitude but when we come before his presence and you know when we enter in you know with the right attitude to be you know the right mental attitude that is what bring down the blessing or the presence of God and you know I come to understand and realize you know I'm not looking at a big crowd and a big gathering because many times I'm being invited into big conventions and you know they have thousands of people that is there but you know what intrigued me most is when a two of the trees are gathered together there is where you can feel a real heartfelt fellowship that God comes down because we come to realize it's so difficult to get everybody into one spirit and in one Accord and when we look into the book of Acts you know the Apostles we may think that it was a very big church but saints of God it was just a handful I loo you but they had the Holy Ghost and when you have the Holy Ghost you don't need a multitude hallelujah because when you received our Holy Ghost that is life hallelujah and you know what God wants in his hour if he could only find one man Alleluia he don't need he don't need a thousand because one is going to chase a thousand unto 10,000 so we have a promise this afternoon that God has given unto us and we all know the lesson how it goes under their Pentecost when they were got into the upper room but they had a commission from Christ Jesus because that is what he commissioned them that they must be there until they be endued with power from on high and a Bible says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come as we are speaking this morning God always deals our with time and season hallelujah and his a purpose and also there must be the right people I Louie because they have to have the right time at the right season before God can work so when they were in one Accord in one place and suddenly they came the Sun from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and they were all filled hallelujah a house they were sitting and they appear unto them cloven tongues like a fire and it's sat upon each of them because they came into the place where God would have of them and if we this evening could come into that place where God would have of us that we can open ourselves and he can come in hallelujah to have fellowship with us then they can be a union without the Union they can be no real fellowship saints of God you find in the world a manner might be going around when a woman is say well be going around for two years and three years and five years and ten years but you have to get into relationship how long you have not get into that marriage covenant there is no life coming forth so we can be coming to church for a long time but if you have not come into the place that you receive the true baptism of your Holy Ghost in your life or what you will be is a good church goer or a good benchwarmer or guardian call us to warm the benches God call us that a fire of God can be in our soul and when a fire of God is in our soul it will burn out every devil hallelujah that devil can you know crazy said the enemy commit and find nothing in me and scenes of God we who are sons of God we have that same privilege that if God is inside of us there's no devil that can come because he that which is in you is greater than he that which is in the world so we come to realize that what we need in this hour we have already given the promise hallelujah the promise of the father but we have to come with a right mental attitude because he says it's the atmosphere that brings the result because you can take egg of a fowl and put it under a dog and still it can come out it can hurt but you see life is in that egg but but by the grace of God we come to realize that our we are living in you have to come under the influence of this message of the hour before you can make it in a rapture Alleluia we're not just talking about safe being safe and being interruptions to different things because they are different con there are different conditions that are existing sins of God and as bright believers in this hour we're not just thinking of being saved hallelujah because for you just to be safe you have to go to a tribulation but a true Bride of Christ hallelujah she don't go to no judgment you don't go to no tribulation because you passed from death unto life what God or what husband will he be if his bride hallelujah has to go to a tribulation that's not love no man who loved his wife hallelujah would want to see her go through anything and we tell God that we this our saints of God he will not allow anything to come and to harm us because we got to come into the right atmosphere but you know what took place and their Pentecost when everything happened the bow says Peter was standing there and with 11:00 and he lifts up his voice and said men of Judah and all that dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words because Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah you come to realize that with all that Peter had one time the part of God was preaching and he says Peter was not called to serve the ministry Peter was called to serve God and what is happening today we feel that we can't be called to serve the church since of God is beyond church hallelujah it's not a church experience it's a Holy Ghost experience we must have the problem today why people are living in such condition is because they have a church experience you gotta get out of a church experience and get a Holy Ghost experience and then you'll be the Bride of Christ Jesus hallelujah because you know what he says he says I no more call you Church but I call you bride and since of God our bride is in a different category all together when you become the bride hallelujah automatically you become his wife because of Bridal ouya you move on from being a bride a loser a wife and when you become that wife we have all the privileges that God has given so the promise of the father is being given to us in this day and just as how they had to receive the Holy Ghost in the beginning it's the same Holy Ghost we have to receive in this hour because God never changed his mind about his word hallelujah so what we come to realize today when they receive the Holy Ghost it was evidently seen that everyone that was around the place they saw a change in those man's life hallelujah they say is these the same people that were here it was salya but now they're not living their life they are living the life of the Holy Ghost so when the life of God comes into this inside of you the seeder Holy Ghost brings to Europe power of transformation so we're being transformed into his image and his likeness because those that walk with Jesus the Word of God said take note that these men had been with Jesus and if we truly following a message of the hour will not be like other Christians but there is something that is superior with those who believe the message because this is a fullness of the word has come and we come to believe this hour that we are living in that a promise of the father was been spoken and they were not just drunk on with wine but they were filled with the Holy Ghost as was promised Alleluia and spoken by the Prophet Joel and today is the same Holy Ghost we need to receive it's not just coming to church and say I want to find a best message Church in the United States I want to find the best things of God you better find your place in Christ Jesus because you can get you can get to the best church or the most scintillating preacher and things of God that wouldn't put you no place if you don't have an experience with God it has to be an individual thing between you and God hallelujah so the prophet of God tells us in a message I am the resurrection and the life paragraph 30 he says what a beautiful type of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost as God led the church natural through the wilderness he says now God is leading his church spiritual hallelujah unnatural is a type of the spiritual but today is spiritual and our mana our life-sustaining resource comes by the Holy Spirit and that is what it come by because what we come to realize the church natural through the wilderness hallelujah they at the Manor hallelujah and if you collect more than what you ought to it will not keep for the next day now what we come to realize God is the sustaining factor in our lives and we cannot want to have more than what has been given unto us Alleluia so God was providing from for them daily and our lives the day we need to feed upon the spiritual manner every day in our life because yes the day manna would not be good for today and today's manner will not be good for tomorrow because the God deal Allah is one day at a time we has to live as believers hallelujah did not a proud of God says that as Christians we should live every day like if it's the last day that we're living but when we look to for how many of us is really living the day like it's the last day that we are living if you really come to understand that our life will be totally different we will give God our all you see God don't want or seconds God want first place is I the first place or no place that is why we got to come into one spirit and in one Accord so the chin of Israel didn't matter of lujah and every more they go and they gather the manna and they will keep that but on the weekend coming before the Sabbath they will have a double portion and that will be kept hallelujah and it will be utilized and it will not SoDo matter how watching me say greedy they might want to be and takes a whole lot at the end of the day it all comes back into hunting because it's the promise of the father hallelujah and is not we ourselves talking about how much Holy Ghost we want because it's the promise of the father to give unto us hallelujah become to realize that Christ Jesus hallelujah he had a fullness of the Holy Ghost but we who was his sons and daughters we have measure of the Holy Ghost inside of us but all together it's the same Holy Ghost the product God says you take a little dip out of the ocean of water a spoonful it's the same con hallelujah that's in the ocean it's no different hallelujah it might be in different quantity but it's the same hallelujah a speck of everything and we told God that none of us is greater than each other because it's one father is one spirit is one baptism over us that God has provided us so we come to realize the chin of Israel they took the manna and after a while they take the manna and you know what happened even a little children they start playing with a man and doing all this kind of thing and scenes of God is a very serious scene in this day people taking the message for granted and everybody feel that you know I could handle the word and I could do this and I can do that but you see what happened when you do that when you allow the things of God to become common to you there is where you lose the joy there is where and you come everything we don't want to get into emotion that's all we got to come to service and or because it's a service day we want to have our joy in our heart sense of God you know as I've always said eating when you're going to eat this much just eat because you have to eat you must have a zest yourself a joy when you're going to eat you know you must have an appetite and you know one brother was praying one time and he says become God for this food and we also thank God for the appetite because God you know some have the food and I don't have the appetite and some have the appetite and they don't have the food but Lord we thank you for both and since of God we thank God that we could come into the house of God with a spiritual appetite you know why because there's a tablespread where the saints of God are fed and he invites his chosen people to come and dine hallelujah and only come and dine we know that we're going to be filled because there is no devil in hell to stop us from feeding upon a word that God has given unto us Alleluia so we come to realize that the or manner or life-sustaining resource comes by the Holy Spirit and as soon as the Apostle had crossed out all they fear and doubt and Gary in the upper room God give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost so when you enter into the presence of God he don't want you to come in fear of the well he wanted to come boldly before him and when you come before him since of God we come to realize that you know God has given unto us he said they that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled so if you come with your heart's desire and you come with a right mental attitude and the right atmosphere is being created hallelujah the presence of God will come down hallelujah God will always honor his word hallelujah we have to get me under the Word of God God will honor us hallelujah and we can receive such a blessing so the prophet of God went on to say God give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost Alleluia so when it fell down that was our mana coming from God out of heaven this is the real manner because we come to realize the churn of Israel Israel they ate manna in the wilderness and are dead but the scribes and the Pharisees they came to the master and you know they were questioning him and all kind of thing he says yes your father did eat manna but they are all dead he said what what what I have to give to you this is this is spirit and I say you are not even 50 years old yet and you're telling us about Moses and all of this they say we believe Moses we don't believe you he says if you had believed Moses you would believe me because what Moses spoke Moses spoke of me well you see they fail to recognize that it was a new dispensation and saints of God we thank God and is not the dispensation on the law but is a dispensation of grace which is a greater covenant to us in this hour that we are living in and since of God we should be so comfortable that God loved us in this last and final age hallelujah praise God which we are spiritual believers we are not in leticia but we are in a bright age we have been called out but naturally the sea the spirit of Leticia in this age hallelujah that is what is ruling hallelujah and we come to realize that is why the world it is in such a condition and churches in such a place Alleluia but we thank God for grace you as individuals that God have called out that is what he's looking for that we can come in his presence and receive the Onis of his word hallelujah so it came like a rushing mighty win and when they received that they went out into the streets and began to preach and testify hallelujah of God and start working miracles the problem God said that is all manna when you received a fullness of Christ Jesus through the baptism of the Holy Ghost sinks of God the average we are living in a prophet of God says in a message making away but God sent a pentecost hallelujah the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what they did they flung the windows and door open and in the street they went God promised it when God promised God will keep his word hallelujah God never changed his mind about his word no matter how long it seemed like it will take when God called Abraham in Genesis to ever say get me out from your country and from your kindred on the land that I will show unto you saints of God Abraham immediately acted upon the Word of God hallelujah amidst all that was being taught to him oh you're a rich man you have everything and now you're leaving where you're going but Abraham heard a voice of God speaking to him saints of God when God is speaking to you there are times you cannot explain to anybody but you know something inside of you and there is no reasoning of no one can come and reason the Word of God away from you because God has spoken to you in the inside since of God is not trying to explain God but is to believe God that is what a word says all things are possible to them that believe it and that is what God wants us to do it is our to believe his word so they went out when God promised God will keep his word and he will make a way of escape he will never suffer you to be tempted above anything that he won't make way of escape for you he'll do it so it doesn't matter what we have to go through in this flesh in this body or in this spirit or whatever we are going through God knows how much we can take he knows how much to give us hallelujah because whatever God is giving to us our allowing us the path true it is for our benefits because we have to be overcomers we have to overcome something in our life what's the use we come into church and sit down are we hearing all the good revelation i sealed my it's a mighty message and this revelation is powerful and we never experienced God in our life we must have that experience and without experience you got to come to love God more because every time you go to a test every time you go to a trial in your life you know what happened we have to be like the tree that is planted by the water when the storm comes and a wind side a blow what happened that's we might shake and it might toss our lujah but what happened it wake up the ground and that root go deeper so every time your trials and your testing comes Aloha when I atmospheres me the promise of the Father is being fulfilled in your life hallelujah that you could become what God would have you to become so the hour that we are living in we need to recognize things of God what God would have of us as believers in this power we could recognize his grace hallelujah so when the Spirit of God comes inside of you it makes a way of escape because in our own human intellectual understanding or our conception there is nothing that we could do to improve our own life there is nothing that we could do to better our conditions there is nothing that we could do Alleluia to make people live better but we can live our Holy Ghost fill life that you can be living epistle rare and seen of all man I load the world today Alleluia there's so much of watching me Seder the social media and the electronics and everything and people seem to have more confidence in those things other than the Word of God when somebody want to know something the first thing they want to do is good let's go Google but for the chin of God you got to get tongue upon your knees hallelujah you want to find out something about the Lord Jesus Christ Google have no answer for that but they have did they have answers for everything since they were only God have answers for his own word hallelujah or whatever answer question it is there is always an answer in the Word of God hallelujah so we need to come into the place that God would have us in a message expectation proverb God says you can't be born again and live any kind of life so when you're born again there's a quality of life that is being expected because when the father gives you the promise hallelujah you have to be qualified to receive that promise to be an adopted son hallelujah you have to go through we are to the ship hallelujah and be successful you don't mean you don't miss classes and fail and expect to come true Alleluia will be the degree you have to go it all over again so it's not how long you take hallelujah but God knows the time for everything hallelujah because this race that we are in is not for the Swift but for those that endure on to the end and that is what God is looking at and in this pathway saints of God we have to endure before we can enjoy but some people want to enjoy but they don't want to enjoy anything Alleluia so that the true enjoyment is in the endurance Alleluia because they that suffer hallelujah they do suffer persecution for what righteousness sake and this persecution is not today and then actually it's a daily persecution it's a daily suffering saints of God we gotta come to realize that we as God's people the bride of this hour we are in a battlefield hallelujah and the enemies after you all the time how he's not resting he knows that his reign is coming to an end and he's getting more brutal he wants to destroy family life he want to keep you upset that you can't function properly but saints of God that is why we have to drink of the fountain of life that God has given unto us in his own provided way so you can't be born again and live any kind of life if somebody say that they are born again then there's a quality of life that you're looking for and the whole world is looking at that too so you you live for Jesus when you born again not a churchgoer when you born again then you can live for Jesus and you act like a man and you conduct yourself as a real question if you're born again of the Spirit of God only then you can live in that way the saints of God we come to realize it's no matter how much books we read or tapes we listen to it's got to come off from the pages it's got to come out from that and get into your heart because it's a live gospel hallelujah this same spoken word has become a living word once again the spoken word which is the original seed has to be alive in us today hallelujah because we'll be getting back into the place that God would have of us and only true the promise of the Father there is where we can get back into the place because we come to his realize that God word is a seed hallelujah God is and God is in his word hallelujah and what we come to recognize that God promised what he would do and he sent the disciples and the Apostles the hundred and twenty up into the upper room and they waited on that Commission he says tarry in the in the city of Jerusalem and you'll in Judit power from on high and a prophet of God said God words sunk into their hearts and they waited there he says what was they doing he said just sitting around he says well I see what will happen you can't he says you can't you say it your water in that way he says if you say well yes I believe in divine healing or sure it isn't the Bible he said that's not the way to get healed you might have that seed but you've got to water it hallelujah so when you read the word you have to watch with with prayer when you listen to it it's my prayer it's not just reading it and leaving it alone hallelujah what as preachers no matter how much we study the Word of God we have to watch with my prayer and sometimes we studied too much and pray less but we need to pray more saints of God because the word of we can do anything too much what we can't pray too much but we allowing the devil to obscure mind and the busyness of the ministry and our Christian life and we have so much things to do and we hardly finding time to pray imagine if we pray one hour day and you calculate it in the year and we pray everyday one hour it's only 15 days for the year we are praying imagine that if you say we pray 12 for today save one hour in the morning 1 now in evening it just started days for the year you're praying how can we live and look how look what is happening that is why the Christian life is so poor and so many things are happening because it seems so difficult Christ Jesus when he was here on earth with his disciples he says just watch it me for one hour and when he went and come back they were all sleeping he said can't you watch with me just for one hour well what's happening today you find that they're trying to go make a little doctrine out of it that's a bell you have to pray at least an hour for the day but saints of God a true Christian of a child of God you don't limited time in prayer you have to pray without ceasing and when you praying one hour you don't have to look at your watch and pray and if you get up because the time is so gloomy that we're living in if you pray five minutes the devil may want to feel like if it's 15 minutes and if you pray half an hour is like you're praying three hour but since about when you really get into the secret of prayer you don't want to come out from the presence of God Alleluia because when you get in there when you get in that sweet fellowship is something that is holding you there Alleluia you know why what is the atmosphere that brings the results and saints of God has made us all Ouya miniature creators Alleluia that we can create the atmosphere that we dwell in so we got to be careful of the atmosphere that we are creating as we can live a dangerous Christian life because do you know how many people are looking at your life on my life sometimes we don't even know that is why saints of God I always believe that is a true believer we don't go anyplace looking over our shoulder to see if we are right or wrong we must live our holy life before God we must conscious of pleasing God Alleluia is not of it when you go places well I hope a brother don't see me I hope I'm not being seen saints of God it doesn't matter where we go our hiding place becomes the pavilion of God so we can't hide from God we can't even hide from ourselves that is why there's a provided way for God hallelujah you know why because when you receive the he goes it quickens you it's a quickening power I'll lure a word of gods and Ephesians 2:1 that our new hottie quicken who are dead in trespasses and sins or any quick and you what it is is to become more alive i Lewis so that is what a word is doing to us hallelujah because through the Adamic nature Alleluia that is why we were dead in trespasses and sins i Louie about a seed of God that is inside of us it comes to quicken that seed to make it up hallelujah because remember you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world hallelujah so because of the Adamic nature you come not to a book when the Word of God comes he didn't that vendor who are the God comes you didn't change you be called a prophet of God he was preaching arkarium the name of the message but he says when they were throwing their nets the fish came in the the turtle the the spiders and and these different kind of different things and and you know the devil divers and different kind of things I mean they all came in he says but what he wanted it was the fish to come into the Masters use he says when did they became fish he said not when the net go over there they were fish all the time but to see what happened when we were dead in trespasses and sin when we hear the word of God - that anointing it bring us out from that condition and put us into the atmosphere where God would have of our saints of God so if you have the seed of God in you you'll want to remain in that atmosphere so all those little water creatures and everything that's water spiders and all those things they came out for a while or what happened they don't have the nature so they're gonna crawl and go right back you know because we come to realize every day when the rainfall it fall on the just and on the unjust but saints of God only the true elect seed of God will come forth and Dermott eyes as a seed because I see when you put it into the ground it has to die and it has to rot your reason why people have so many false and and different attitudes and the churches today the prophet of God says to many people has been buried alive and when you're being buried alive you're gonna kick and you in a fuss and you're gonna do all kind of thing but when you're dead in him hallelujah is not you living any law but Paul says to me to live is Christ so when Christ is living through you your attitude your life your whole disposition changes and that is what we tongue God for in the hour that we are living in hallelujah so we come to realize that a seed of God coming down into the depths of our heart we can recognize the grace of God hallelujah so when our Holy Ghost comes what is it convicts you and it sink down into the depths of your heart and there is no other voice can come and obscure that voice in you because we all know that the hour that we are living in there are many voices that have gone out and every voice will try what you may say to emulate the real voice but since that what you have or we have something inside of us that when God speaks we know any speaking hallelujah you people can come here and they say well you know they don't know when God is moving but you know hallelujah you don't have to hear the big thunderings and the lightning i loo even elijah was running up in a monkey and there was thunderings and they were lightening and there were earthquakes and there were so many things but said God was not in that but God was in the still small voice which he heard and that is the way how God is speaking today in the hour that we are living in st. so we are being manifested sons and daughters of God in this hour to do what God would have us to do in a message in the rising of the Sun the proud of God was saying he was telling us in st. Luke chapter 24 verses 49 he says behold I send the promise of the far upon you but tarry he are weighty in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued perform high he says to show that not only did they draw all the benefits out of it but they share those benefits so when you receive hallelujah is also to share when Abraham receive a blessing who God bless no man curse and whoever come under the influence of that faith hallelujah it becomes a blessing so when God blesses you it's the blessed orders also that is why I believe you know so many times we go and trips the minister the Word of God and it's not just sharing a blessing but you receive a blessing also hallelujah and sometimes it's a greater blessing because of the fellowship that you can receive a sense of God we come to realize in the hour that we are living in we need to have Holy Ghost fellowship Alleluia not just hanging out together but our fellowship we need to provoke one another on to what on to righteousness not on to anger today you find a bunch of Christians getting together and they fell and they provoking one another to anger because what you doing we are not here to test each other who no more message we are not here to do that but we are here to provoke one another to serve God in a better way that our lives can be worthy of this gospel that is our position excuse me that is a privilege hallelujah that is a privilege we got a comment we got a praise God more for what he had done for us saints of God what what we have received saints of God is not 19:06 restoration of the gifts this messages of fullness of the Holy Ghost hallelujah revelation 10 707 angel shall begin to song all the mystery of God shall be finished so what we are we have the fullness of the revelation of the Word of God so we must have a life that can conquer every sin every devil every condition no battle is too hard for God the Word of God shall be still and know that I am God hallelujah many times we want to act out of patience with saints of God we gotta come to realize the promise of the Father we have to wait until the appropriate time come and how long we cannot come into the right atmosphere we can never receive anything from God so many times we ourselves as an individual we are the ones who hindering what God will have in store for us because of my attitude because of your attitude how we treat God how we treat the things of God saints of God we gotta come in this hour we know the world is falling apart and everything is so sloppy on us but don't let her lies become that way hallelujah is not even to look at an example a proud of God sin tells us I can't remember the name of the message he says whatever the bernam table not to become don't let it become you that is what he says don't let it become you because it be our hope is not build upon the tabernacle but our hope is builded in Christ Jesus hallelujah because we come to realize the message didn't come from Jeffersonville it came true defenses Oh hallelujah that is why we need to have respect also because you have men there preaching all kind of things and they're disrespectful but a proud of God so we must have respect and when we have respect you're gonna receive a blessing from God because God is in charge of everything many times we are too why this and why that since of God just believe the Word of God today many men they are quite say well why you know I wonder what next would be because there's so many false doctrines around Israel I wonder what next will be that is not my problem and your problem to think what is going to come up because when you're working in a bunker somewhere they don't bring a come to feed dollar and to study they give the original and since of God we have the original word which is the original seed we got a plumb line of the Word of God that he has given unto us we don't care what false comes false things will come and it will go but Christ Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and he never changes his mind about his word we have the fullness of the word that God has given unto us hallelujah what on earth we are living in so we come to realize that we need to receive the promise of the father because he says behold I send you the promise of the father upon you but Perry he await he in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from high is the same thing today we need to wait in the presence of God then the sound data to wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength you want to mount up with wings of ego you're gonna run and not be weary you and I'll walk or not faint a lot of a lot are fainting around the waistline but saints of God we are not on the wayside we are the highway we're days away because God have called his sons and daughter come up here hallelujah and when you come up here hallelujah as Eagles in this hour we have the we have G over ego praise God and he's feeding us and egos is the only only the front at time they born eating meets Alleluia is not wonderful to know that true elects hallelujah praise God can never be discouraged by the Word of God it doesn't matter how hard it comes and sometimes they tell you in a church well you need to have wisdom when you have the wisdom of the Holy Spirit since of God it will go forth when the word of God go forth the Bible says it can never return void it will accomplish what it hostile so when the Lord lay upon your heart I speak the word you don't care who is being offended if the word has to offend somebody saints of God it's well being offended God keeps his own word Alleluia but we have man-made wisdom on all these kind of things but they that are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God and we want to be under the leadership of the Holy Spirit Alleluia in acts 244 it says and they continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread excuse me and in prayers and he says unfair came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things in common do we have all things in common sayings of God if we believe the Word of God hallelujah appear from South America North America Africa wherever we have the Word of God and we should be in one spirit and in one Accord saints of God we cannot allow we cannot allow what can we say the barriers of this world to stop us because we have a heavenly language we have the Holy Ghost which will lead us and to guide us into all truth in the very word of God which he had provided for us and what we come to realize you know the disciples when they were going through they gets enemy the Bible tells the halt when they are going to the persecution they came into their own company so if we are believers when something is going wrong we don't run to a man on the outside we don't go run to our advisers and all these things we all turn on the ology to get hung up on our knee card before God we have brothers of like precious faith that's the best way that we could come saints of God that's the way we need to come back o bi sheep of his pasture and when sheep having probably what to do they commonly bunch up together they Club themselves together and that's the way God wants of us that we could come in one spirit in one unity and in the corridor God would have of us Alleluia so we got to come in his provided way you see as Christians our life should not be impersonating but our life is a direct life is not trying to act a Christian life but its Christ living for you Paul says to me the living Christ in a message here in paragraph 85 the proud of God's on you without the Holy Ghost and knows that you got to have that dramatized seat or it would come up you farmers know that if the seed isn't Dermott eyes no matter how good it looks Alleluia it won't live no matter how much you can impersonate a Christian life by good living you've got to be born again there are many they can live a good Christian life they're kind and generous and they can do so many things and they have morals and they have everything but that will not keep you because Christ Jesus said if your righteousness cannot exceed the scribes and the Pharisees you can make it but do you know what kind of life they were living they were living such a religious life and they were so pride in their life that they're living but when you are true elect of God you are not living your life and pride because you know that it's not you living but it's Christ Jesus living so we don't have a show-off life well you know I'm living a better life and you know I have the best family and all this kind of thing there's too much of competition our own sins of God as son of God we are not competing against each other we have one common enemy and that's the devil and that's we got to come against what we ought to pray for one another that we can live in harmony by the leadership of the Holy Ghost saints of God in the hour that we are living in so a Dermott ice it has to come so what is happening today you cannot impersonate a Christian life by good living you gotta be born again that is why we need the Holy Ghost so we need a promise of the Father the Holy Ghost will come inside us it was promised hallelujah on to your children and even to those that are afar off sins of God and in this day we are the ones that was afar off you're the last in the whole set but saints of God we got a thank God that God kept the best for the last it's not wonderful not alone as we should thank God for because all the saints and all the prophets of old they would have glad to see this day they would have glad to live in this hour that we are living in that is why we are such a privileged people to recognize the Grace and that mercies of God in our life hallelujah what are our you gotta have the Holy Spirit if you haven't got it he says then come here we him we gotta have we must know by an experience not somebody gotta tell you that you have the Holy Ghost you must know it for yourself haloo it must be identified in your life since of God the way we live it is an experience Alleluia that is why Nicodemus when he came to the master you know he wanted he said what must I do he said you gotta be born again he said oh how I am such an old man and I can be born how I can get into my mother's womb the second time he had a common interpretation to the spiritual revelation I remember he was an old man we don't even know if his mother was alive so just think of it we can be so what you may say educated and we can have so many things in our mind but we need to have the mind of Christ the call you find that it is too much of carnal interpretation to the spiritual revelation and we have our own thinking but a Word of God says we need to be debt or own thinking we need to debt our own thoughts we must have his mind we must have the mind of Christ and only when you have the mind of Christ sense of God then you can create the right atmosphere to get the right results hallelujah in the 1st Corinthians chapter 12 verses stuff tells us for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so so it doesn't matter how many look like or how many bright Church you have around the world it is one body and how long we don't come to recognize that sense of God we can never come into the harmony of the Holy Spirit we gotta come to realize when a Holy Spirit comes inside of us it transcends every culture it breaks every barrier hallelujah we don't have Chinese and Indian and an American and African culture hallelujah because we have the promise of the Father when you receive the Holy Ghost in your life it's a heavenly life that you are now living the problem is today we think too much in our culture and our background and a family we came from on all these different kind of thing since of God we know that we came from God and we going back to him our natural heritage it don't means nothing what is not looking at their natural heritage because if I have to look at our natural heritage I one of my cousin living in Canada he went back into study our family tree and it went way back in Canton somewhere in China with my great-great grandfather he was a gambler and he loved to deal in gold and all these different kind of things and he became a murderer because of gold and that's why in Guyana when up in Guyana I grew up as a as a boy and I learned the trade of gold to make jewelry and I'll become my father he was uh he was a jeweler I grew up as a jeweler but when it comes to Christ Jesus saints of God it's a sanctifying portion of the leadership of the Holy Spirit so it's not your natural family tree saints of God we have we have a spiritual heritage we have a heavenly heritage that God has promised us hallelujah and there's no devil in hell that can stop that heritage from coming into it's its place hallelujah so for as many as as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ hallelujah for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or made a drink of one spirit spirit so we come here this afternoon we are drinking hallelujah in one spirit knowing that it's a commission for us in this hour that we are living in you know in a message the token paragraph one five seven I think it might be very familiar to you here he says now when you want eternal life you receive a token showing that a price has been paid it isn't the blood but it's the token of the blood it is the life itself he says Amen follow BD ins to the whole Word of God to God's entire word will entitle you to the token so it is the fullness of the word it is the promise of the Father that we receive the fullness of the Holy Ghost and since they were whole long we cannot come under the influence of the Holy Spirit in subjection to the word of God we can never receive it or we can be as religious and what we find today we have a bunch of religious message believers intellectual conception and a devil is having you kicked around like a football but when you have the Holy Ghost inside of you saints of God the word says he that which is in you is greater than he doctors in the world hallelujah so when Christ comes into your heart saints of God there's no devil in hell that can stop you hallelujah and the Word of God says in my two five six blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled you know why because it is the promise of the Father if a promise has been given and you don't accept the promise then what's use that a promise is been given you have to claim your inheritance and you have to fight every inch of the way our inheritor yes the promise is given but we got to recognize what is being promised to us and how long we don't recognize what is being promised to us we'll never go out and get it that is why we got a recognizable position in Christ Jesus and come into his provided way saints of God so we come to realize when you receive the fullness of the Holy Ghost that's the abstract title deed that is being sent down from heaven you it is a fullness of the life of Christ Jesus then we can say we really believe this message because this message is quickening power so when those disciples receive the Holy Ghost in their life hallelujah they was not fearing them any longer that is why they flung flung the door and the windows open and they ran upon the street which the gospel and saints of God is the very same thing we ought to be doing today because we have received the last Commission to go to tarana preach the gospel until the end come Bora stop the devil is so subtle today he may have you fighting no this group is better than that and this group is better and everybody coming together and trying to have what to me say a superiority over the other but a Word of God said to go out and preach this gospel and do you know what a privileged people that we are that we can be part of this last Commission to go out and preach this gospel saints of God before the income we don't know when that last one will come in but since of God we gotta create the right atmosphere that will bring the right result is the atmosphere that brings the result so it's not just in the church and our very arms Alleluia this said this morning charity begins at home if you don't have a home life how you gonna get a church life what's the use we sell you have a church life and we cannot live properly at home and when we go out saints of God God don't compromise this word I Louie back home he says some people have church clothes they got work clothes and I got going out clothes under church law might seem to be you know most moderate but the see God looks at your heart Alleluia and is the very same thing we come to realize today that we have a promise that God has given to us in his provided way that we can stay with a Word of God in Revelation chapter 22 14 tells us blessed are they that do His commandments hallelujah that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates into the city blessed are they that do His commandments Alleluia His commandments is not by the flesh and you're pleasing garden you gotta know him by a revelation Alleluia King what you were sacrificing before God by the flesh the intellect what he thought would have been nice before God but a male is sacrificed before God it was a revelation so the true elect of God you are not living by an intellectual conception you are living by the revelation of this word Alleluia so that is what you gotta come to recognize the Grace and the mercies of God in our life and Deuteronomy chapter one verse it said behold I have set the land before you he says go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father's Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them saints of God our seeds of Abraham Alleluia we may not miss me I'm not talking about a natural lineage thinks of God but as the spiritual seed I'm talking about today our lujah they said and I speak unto you at a time saying I am NOT able to bear he says I am not able to bear you myself alone he says the Lord your God had multiplied you and behold he he are this day as the stars of the heaven for multitude the Lord God of your father make you a thousand times so many more as he are and bless you as he had promised you since of God is a spiritual blessing that God has given unto us and in this hour that we are living in didn't the words of the spirit and the bride say come and let him that hear say come and let him that is athirst come on Lucifer will let him take off the waters of life really since of God when you received that you have the freedom of the Holy Spirit that you can fellowship with him and he with you that is the purpose of us coming into the presence of God you know when you come and receive the Holy Ghost then your disposition changes then you know that your sons and daughters of God you will not want to live any kind of life any longer but you would live the way that God would have you Alleluia you will know that there's a change in you like an artist can see that changes in your life too you don't have to tell somebody that you're changed you can say and you can pretend Christianity or a part of God's are you gonna blow up some way down the line it's not pretending Judas pretend a long time Alleluia but coming to the end there's a time of manifestation and no matter how long we say that we believe this message saints of god we always say a thing time will tell time is the greatest factor of healing time is the greatest factor of revealing Alleluia return God for grace Alleluia that we are not creatures of time but we are children of eternity Alleluia because we are hidden Christ Jesus there is nothing can come and separate us from the love of God hallelujah the problem God says in a message when divine love project his Sovereign Grace takes its place paragraph 19 says then when you become a son or daughter of God your disposition changes your attitude changes your all you look towards life and towards others changes it doesn't mean that you just have joined church it means that you have been regenerated you have become a new creation in Christ Jesus that you have the old things have passed away and God has spoken to you and you have become a new creature he says I want this to go down even into church members then as you would love to be in a presence of Christ and you become a part of Christ then people love to become in your presence because you become a part of God son and daughter of God so that is why when you come and you receive the promise of the Father your whole disposition changes and the atmosphere that you live in it changes the circumstances and the condition around you God has given us the ability to change every condition are on us no matter how contrary it looks like because when Christ comes into you sense of God you have the spoken word you you have the life inside of you Alleluia because we come to realize when the word has been the spoke the word their spirit and their life and when you know your position as sons and daughters of God is nothing can stop you alleluiah it says did you ever see people that you just love to be in their presence he said just there just something about them that attracts already it's that you just love to talk to them and other people who you are nice people he says yet we don't say this unkindly but you just can hardly stand around them it is because of the atmosphere that you create to say that we must be conscious of the atmosphere that we are creating Alleluia if you have God inside of you you'll be mindful of how you treat others you're not going to do things that God is inside of you yeah he was mindful and everything we have to be our giveaw come for everything we say every action we make God is gonna hold us responsible that is why we need to come to recognize saints of God it's an atmosphere that brings the result so if we live in a right atmosphere then we'll have good results we live a godly life hallelujah praise his wonderful name so he said for you as sons and daughters of god you're a miniature creator and because you're a part of God and that's the reason you can believe the Bible for anything it says for the for the word is God's Word you being part of God will agree with the word since of God that true elect would only agree with the Word of God Alleluia is the devil that will not agree with the Word of God Alleluia and it doesn't matter how much disagree with the Word of God Alleluia you're not looking at a multitude but you are looking at your position lujah in Christ Jesus because of his life which he has given unto us excuse me so life gotta be worthy of this gospel and we gotta stay with a fullness of the word that he has given unto us 1st Peter chapter 4 verses 17 tells us for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what Charlie and be for them that obey not the gospel of God what on water scripture for the time has come that judgment must begin at a house of God and if the first begun at us what shall the end of them that will be not the gospel saints of God we are a privileged people we got to understand that there's a promise of the Father that has been given to us and to our children and even to those that are far off Alleluia and we have to stay under that anointing of the word that God has given unto us we are expecting a break true of the Holy Spirit to come down in this last day that a bride will have that final anointing the problem God says in a message the token paragraph 24 he says I am looking for a time of a break forth of the Spirit of God in these last days that we now living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for a rupturing faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that and I believe that we know at a time that a word should have preeminence I believe that a time to lay aside all creeds on her thoughts and come back to the word God in every age as I spoke last Eve he told the end from the beginning he told what would be in each generation also and God in sundry time he sent for the prophets when each time come those things that happen for that age he sent for profit so in every age God sent a prophet hallelujah that he appointed were not each Alleluia and his age that we are living in God sent hallelujah Malachi 4:5 in a full restoration of the word hallelujah that we going back into that original position that God wants of us and the word of the Lord always come to his prophets the prophets for that age and each time only thing that profited was to manifest exactly the promise for that age and since of God a message the hour that is the promise to us in this age that we have received the fullness of the revelation of the word of God in our lives that is why we can come and you can have true fellowship in the Word of God that he has given unto us hallelujah so God is good to his people so at the fullness of when the fullness of time has come there one spirit one Accord in one place where we ought to be this evening the very same because the proud of God tells us there would be another book of Acts again they would they have to come and nodded Ephesian we got to get back to the beginning and the way true that too way to the Tree of Life life is back to the blood which is the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which cleanses us from all unrighteousness and that is where we going back the saints of God we come to realize that after the seals were open and we received the fullness of the reality of the word of God all the loose the problem God took together and tie it back into the scriptures that he says in the beginning it was not so become he come to realize there are many loose things and people are coming to I want to tell you oughta misconstrue the Word of God and they tried to make coats upon coats and these things but since of God God never changed his mind about his word so what we believe that the serpent seed margin divorce and the problem God has preached excuse me is to bring us back to the original because the original word is the original seed and a promise of the Father is on to us since of God so let us come into the right atmosphere because it is the atmosphere that brings the result and God has given us the ability to create the atmosphere that we dwell in that we can live in hallelujah become God for grace in the hour that we are living in so our attitude has to be right it is the attitude that brings the result Alleluia that's the reason at Pentecost they had to go to the upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came and that is what brings the result saints of God we gotta have that and it can only come true this reveal word for this day we cannot sit around and live any contrary lives and expect that we will receive the promise of the Father I lujah it is only given to those that he has ordained before the foundation of the world so we want a tongue God in His hour that we could come and we can sit in the presence of God and receive the fullness of his word so it is important for us to receive things of God the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives and that is what is going to take us true that is what will make us Alleluia stand against the wiles of the enemy because in this hour we need God more than any other time Alleluia what are our let us all stand together hallelujah gracious God and heavenly father Lord we come before you thanking you for your grace you want to thank me for your love on your mercy Lord that Lord to know that you can speak our hearts Lord and letting us recognize Lord it is the atmosphere that brings the result Lord we pray that you may help us Lord as you continue to feast upon your word as we continue to serve you Lord we pray that you may have your way in our lives lord you give you all the praise and all the glory and all the honor Lord knowing that you're the mighty guard that is unveiled before us Lord we give you all the praise we give you all the honor and we give you all the glory in Jesus name Amen hallelujah what our that we are living in probably we can sing this little chorus when I see the Blood I pass over you please garden when I see the blood when I see how advanced I will pass over you see the Blood I will pass
