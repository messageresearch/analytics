[24:00] Oh shine Oh shine why I need you too
[24:27] Lord shine who lay the lie Amen we
[24:45] appreciate the Lord
[24:48] we need our God to shine on us the
[24:53] purpose of him shining on us is not just
[24:55] for direction but that God may shine on
[24:59] us that that like me dispelled all the
[25:02] darkness we're going to ask that you
[25:06] turn with us to Luke 17 and 29 and then
[25:12] we'll go to Psalms 41 to agree
[25:21] I'm sure all of you are aware that
[25:24] milligram passed today I know he was a
[25:30] messenger 1 in this day amen to those
[25:35] who are of the foolish but thank god
[25:42] they're saved probably God said the only
[25:47] difference between those that will be
[25:49] saved under his ministry versus ours is
[25:51] that God had a pattern but they were
[25:55] made out of the same material it's got a
[25:59] way of cutting us in instead of cutting
[26:03] us out because God did cut some in and
[26:07] cut some out but the beautiful thing
[26:11] about it is that everybody is here to
[26:13] serve God's purpose I'm happy for Billy
[26:18] Graham many may think he's not there I
[26:22] don't know what people think it doesn't
[26:25] matter because everything that he had to
[26:28] do he did Samsom didn't do everything
[26:34] right but that Samson did everything
[26:36] right because God ordained Samson God
[26:44] allowed Samson to be blind to put Samson
[26:48] in a position to serve his purpose and
[26:53] that is to kill the rest of the
[26:55] Philistines as much as Samson I guess if
[27:01] he had a choice he would not have done
[27:03] what he did but who can stop and direct
[27:07] the mind of God God knew what Sam was
[27:11] going to do before Samson was even born
[27:15] I am happy because we know that his
[27:21] going away is significant to our going
[27:24] away hallelujah
[27:29] let's read the word saint-luc 1729 but
[27:35] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[27:37] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[27:40] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[27:46] it be in the day when the Son of Man is
[27:49] revealed one more scripture Psalms 41
[27:56] through three I trust everybody is happy
[28:00] tonight it is a dangerous time that
[28:03] we're living in it is a soul-searching
[28:07] time you and I must understand this
[28:11] different thing to be born again and
[28:14] another thing to be sealed the
[28:17] born-again experience means that you
[28:19] have accepted Lord Jesus Christ as your
[28:21] Savior
[28:22] sealed mean that you have been matured
[28:25] and God has approved you for a rapture
[28:30] there are a lot of people who are born
[28:32] again but won't make a rapture because
[28:36] they did not complete the seal
[28:39] understand the same Holy Ghost with same
[28:42] spirit that brought them to a
[28:43] sanctification
[28:44] it's the same spirit that can bring them
[28:47] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost as well
[28:49] as the sealing of the Holy Ghost some
[28:54] people teach it differently but as I
[28:57] started this message I realized there is
[28:59] a difference because the blood of Jesus
[29:02] Christ brought the foolish version up to
[29:04] a sanctification which is kind of like a
[29:07] holiness but it's not a complete
[29:10] holiness because the desire to sin is
[29:14] still in them but when God gives you the
[29:17] complete holiness the desire to sin is
[29:20] burnt away so we think God because
[29:24] nothing will be allowed in heaven with
[29:26] the sin nature or desire to sin Isaiah
[29:31] excuse me Psalms 41 two three I waited
[29:35] for the Lord and he inclined to me and
[29:38] heard my cry he brought me
[29:42] up also out of an horrible pit out of
[29:46] the miry clay and set my feet upon a
[29:49] rock and established my goings and he
[29:54] have put a new song in my mouth even
[29:57] praise unto our God many shall see it
[30:01] and fear and shall trust in the Lord let
[30:07] us pray
[30:07] dear Jesus as we stand before us lawyer
[30:12] before you you have seen me throughout
[30:15] the day you have heard my cry you've
[30:19] seen my prayers and my supplication and
[30:22] father I give this night to you
[30:28] we pray Lord tonight that you would
[30:31] bless the service may the word of God
[30:35] find good ground help us now in your
[30:39] name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may
[30:42] be seated
[30:47] one time one thing I do want want to
[30:50] emphasize tonight is that our adversary
[30:53] is real you know it's like you know you
[31:00] can't play with fire without eventually
[31:03] being burnt you and I must understand
[31:07] this is a critical moment in this moment
[31:12] in this time brings on pressure maybe
[31:15] perhaps we were not so zealous are not
[31:21] so sincere until today
[31:27] I don't know the kind of effect that
[31:31] brother Billy Graham's passing has had
[31:36] upon you but it has stirred me up and
[31:41] vindicate it to me what I've been
[31:43] feeling I've been trying to say to this
[31:47] church that the Lord is soon to come and
[31:50] I really believe that with all of my
[31:53] heart I don't know how to explain it
[31:56] but all I can say if the birds knew that
[31:59] the wall of India was going to fall
[32:01] because of an earthquake and they didn't
[32:04] have the Holy Ghost but they had a God
[32:06] looking out for them those of us who
[32:09] have the Holy Ghost of you can't feel
[32:11] that pool to be sincere and the more to
[32:16] be more consecrated and to make yourself
[32:18] ready then there's nothing I can do to
[32:20] help you and the only one that person
[32:24] that can help you is you you've got to
[32:27] get before God and cry out to him
[32:29] because that's what it's all about if
[32:31] you don't give all your heart to God it
[32:35] will show God is requiring us to give
[32:42] all of his heart all of your heart to
[32:45] him there are there is no room for no
[32:47] other idols no idols at all not even
[32:51] yourself there's no room for self
[32:54] worship and that's the truth the Bible
[33:00] said in this day men will become more
[33:02] lovers of pleasures than lovers of God
[33:05] men will love themselves more than they
[33:08] love God I like to entitle this message
[33:12] extreme pressure extreme means to go
[33:20] beyond the boundaries of being moderate
[33:23] you always have a balance maybe this is
[33:27] the balance but extreme means it went
[33:29] way beyond the balance you've heard
[33:33] people under pressure says I just feel
[33:35] like I'm about ready to go out of my
[33:37] mind which is something that you should
[33:39] never do because Satan might take you up
[33:41] on that one day but we say that because
[33:45] the pressure is so extreme and and we
[33:47] don't really know how to deal with that
[33:51] kind of a pressure it's different from
[33:53] all of the rest it means going to the
[33:58] utmost or a very great length in action
[34:02] habit or opinion it's something that
[34:04] sometimes seems absurd but never
[34:09] amen is something that you and I have
[34:13] been designed to handle it may have seen
[34:23] like it may be it may seem like the
[34:25] earlier church had a grade of faith than
[34:30] what we have because seem like they
[34:32] conquered Satan in such a great way many
[34:35] of them lost their lives but we're
[34:39] living in the greatest and the most evil
[34:42] age ever what they dealt with in Ephesus
[34:49] was on another level then what we're
[34:53] dealing with we we are literally dealing
[34:55] with the ant eluvian demons and Satan is
[35:00] doing everything that he can to keep you
[35:03] from making a rapture to be honest with
[35:07] you I'd rather be burned at the stake
[35:10] chopped up or something than to have to
[35:15] experience the great tribulation you and
[35:20] I have no idea it can't even come into
[35:23] your mind or you can't even comprehend
[35:25] what Satan has for those foolish virgins
[35:29] look what he did in the days of Jesus
[35:32] with Herod sent the his soldiers down to
[35:36] Bethlehem to kill all those children
[35:39] that was two years or three years in
[35:41] under up animal net babies they
[35:45] slaughtered right in in while they were
[35:47] in their mother's arms babies and do you
[35:52] think he's going to spare us the fact
[36:01] the matter is is that during that time
[36:03] you won't have no holy ghost feelings
[36:08] there will be no quickening to you there
[36:11] will be no shouting there will be no joy
[36:13] because at that time the mercy seat
[36:17] there is none
[36:19] the blood is off the altar and now you
[36:22] are alone you must become a martyr oh it
[36:27] sounds easy but it's not it won't be but
[36:35] for those who will overcome God will
[36:38] give them rogues at the end it will be
[36:45] extreme pressure it'll be something that
[36:50] you can't it's going to either be faith
[36:52] or no faith at all whatever you have
[36:55] you're gonna have to use it the thing I
[37:01] don't know how how does the foolish
[37:04] virgins make it other than to know that
[37:06] God is God and that the fault is their
[37:10] own pressure y'all know what pressure is
[37:15] a woman when she goes through
[37:19] childbearing for the first time I can't
[37:21] not imagine it because I'm sure she's
[37:24] had imagined in her mind how bad is
[37:26] going to be but it's beyond what she
[37:29] could imagine because she's never been
[37:32] there before
[37:34] understand that's what I'm saying even
[37:36] if you imagine what the Great
[37:38] Tribulation is going to be like it's
[37:40] going to be beyond what you imagined
[37:43] because so you saw that you understand
[37:46] all that belong to heaven will be in
[37:49] heaven except the Jews and God will be
[37:52] their God it Israel so when you when God
[37:58] has the Holy Spirit is lifted from the
[38:01] earth that means Satan is in full swing
[38:05] Satan is ruler he's going to rule earth
[38:09] like he ruled hell that's why the
[38:13] prophet of God said
[38:14] amen that hell and earth is blending and
[38:17] we can see the effects of it
[38:20] look what Hollywood is producing
[38:21] understand those inspiration comes from
[38:24] some where it's not just an imagination
[38:28] it is something that the devil is now
[38:32] impressing upon the people y'all think
[38:35] it's bad and I want to draw a grim
[38:39] picture because I want you to understand
[38:41] what you're trading in your trading hell
[38:46] for heaven you're trading heaven because
[38:53] you're not ready to give up your ways
[38:55] your trading heaven because you don't
[38:57] want to give up your traditions your
[39:00] trading heaven because you don't want to
[39:02] give up your lust your trading heaven
[39:05] ain't meant for foolishness and when
[39:09] it's said and done you're gonna realize
[39:13] you lost everything for nothing the
[39:20] Bible said what was gained ameno what
[39:22] would it profit a man to gain the whole
[39:23] world and lose his soul I'm going slow
[39:26] like this tonight
[39:27] we look at these things and I want to
[39:29] say you know we're in a time like this
[39:32] we need to be sure that the blood has
[39:36] been applied that we are sealed with the
[39:40] Holy Ghost and if we're not we need to
[39:43] get to work you say well how do we get
[39:46] to work down on your knees the blood
[39:50] veil when you're down on your knees the
[39:57] prophet of God was saying in what is the
[39:59] Holy Ghost would be a message I want you
[40:01] to listen to you the Holy Ghost what is
[40:04] the Holy Ghost 1959 1216 a powerful
[40:09] message and I really would love for you
[40:13] all to listen to it because it will tell
[40:16] you where you're standing in God the
[40:21] prophet of God said we're not entering
[40:23] into this just for a protracted meeting
[40:28] I'll say that tonight if I have a
[40:31] preacher sincere message it is tonight I
[40:34] want to enter into this and I want you
[40:37] and have you and have asked you to burn
[40:41] every Bridge behind you and make every
[40:46] sin right that we are coming into this
[40:50] with all our hearts
[40:53] and lies we must come here for the sole
[40:57] purpose of getting our souls ready for
[41:00] the coming of the Lord and for no other
[41:04] purpose and as I have spoken and said
[41:07] that maybe sometime I might teach or say
[41:10] something that may be contrary to what
[41:14] someone else but listen that's the way I
[41:17] believe it I believe it all of my heart
[41:21] amen in order to cgc this message it's
[41:26] the only things can really point you to
[41:28] Jesus John was the only one that can
[41:31] point you to Jesus the real Jesus and
[41:36] what people don't understand is election
[41:39] is one thing the reason why you came to
[41:43] this message because you was elected it
[41:47] doesn't mean that God wasn't dealing
[41:49] with you before you came to the message
[41:50] he dealt with you before you came to the
[41:53] message because she was elected to come
[41:55] to the message right what drew you to
[42:05] this and you cannot it you know we can't
[42:10] help the people bow down and worship the
[42:12] Prophet and all that that has to listen
[42:15] that has nothing to do with truth truth
[42:19] is true and as long as it can be
[42:24] explained in the Word of God you must
[42:26] accept it the beautiful thing about
[42:30] where we're standing today because we
[42:33] know that the property God identified
[42:35] Oral Roberts and Billy Graham as two
[42:37] angels he was the third one
[42:41] the other two amen they were ordained
[42:44] one for the Baptist area and went for
[42:47] the Pentecostal you know what I'm saying
[42:49] these angels were born and raised to
[42:52] call out those out of Sodom right in
[42:58] other words they were foolish but they
[43:00] were chosen to be foolish virgins that
[43:06] was election do you understand me if
[43:11] they were elected to be foolish virgins
[43:17] come on I know I'm not a foolish virgin
[43:22] but had a beard I'd rather be one then
[43:24] not one heaven is where I'm designed to
[43:30] go and we know it was right after the
[43:40] Angels left Sodom the fire fell the same
[43:49] day the Bible says when light went out
[43:51] the fire fell now a day can be a period
[43:57] of time like Jesus said when he was on
[44:01] the cross
[44:01] Amen 2.22 the thief he said this day
[44:05] you'll be with me in paradise
[44:09] hallelujah and understand that Jesus it
[44:13] wasn't exactly it was that day in period
[44:15] in time but Jesus it took three days
[44:18] before he rose and it was after three
[44:22] days that did that that that that that
[44:25] the thief was dead but Jesus was
[44:29] speaking when I get up out of the grave
[44:31] you getting going up to but so sure that
[44:34] day represented a period of time you
[44:41] understand me so when we look at this
[44:45] thing you and I must understand we have
[44:47] been ordained to make a rapture is that
[44:51] right
[44:51] Luke 17 20 29 says but the same day that
[44:54] the
[44:55] lot went out of Sodom it rained fire
[44:57] brimstone from the other and that's not
[44:59] what I'm going for where I'm going where
[45:01] I'm going but I'm starting off this way
[45:02] so that you can understand and then if
[45:05] you're not ready to meet God your time
[45:08] is this is where desperation should come
[45:13] in it's spooky kind of scary because you
[45:19] know what brother Graham said he said
[45:21] Abraham never was in Sodom and how are
[45:31] we going to get out of this mess there's
[45:34] only one thing that can resurrect you
[45:36] and that is the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[45:40] Ghost is a sign of circumcision when you
[45:44] receive the Holy Ghost it's not I
[45:47] approve of God is God who approves of
[45:50] you hallelujah is now all I've accepted
[45:56] the Lord no the Lord has accepted you it
[46:02] was a a critical thing among the
[46:06] Israelites when they would refuse
[46:08] circumcision and circumcision came only
[46:12] eighth day for every male child that was
[46:15] to move there's four skins and the
[46:21] expression is to remove or to release
[46:25] the Serpent's part in other words
[46:30] circumcision of the heart is to cleanse
[46:33] and to remove the serpent away from your
[46:36] heart in other words when you get the
[46:40] Holy Ghost you don't no longer think
[46:43] like a serpent and that means is Amen
[46:49] that every word of God is a man there is
[46:55] no but when it comes a men to a true
[46:58] born-again believer the
[47:06] know that those of us and i'ma tell you
[47:08] what the coke come from what is the Holy
[47:10] Ghost did you know Amen those who did
[47:13] not receive circumcision was not allowed
[47:17] to fellowship with those who were
[47:19] circumcised remember how the porter got
[47:23] so upset with Moses what was it extreme
[47:26] pressure hallelujah
[47:29] it was it was what Moses was supposed to
[47:31] do but she kept up with the days and she
[47:34] realized that her son was not
[47:36] circumcised and Moses was so busy he did
[47:41] not circumcise his own son so sapore are
[47:44] Zipporah she got that knives and she cut
[47:46] that foreskin up and threw it at him and
[47:48] said you're bloody husband yes she had a
[47:51] temper she was mad with him but she was
[47:55] literally saving her son had he not been
[47:59] circumcised on the eighth day amen he
[48:02] would have been excommunicated from the
[48:07] promises of God only eight day is what
[48:12] day this day this is the day amen of the
[48:19] great convocation this is the beginning
[48:23] of time we have left time and we are in
[48:25] eternity I don't know what you see when
[48:29] you received the Holy Ghost you're no
[48:31] longer a time being you become a being
[48:36] of eternity that's why the devil is
[48:40] trying to stop you from getting it he
[48:43] can't he made me can hinder but he can't
[48:46] because everybody that's predestinated
[48:47] to get the Holy Ghost is going to get it
[48:51] everybody you say Oh Lord you know I'm
[48:55] not sealed yet don't worry it ain't in
[48:57] your hands anyhow God will bring that
[49:00] sealing to you oh yeah if God got to put
[49:06] you on your bed and make you think about
[49:09] everything you ever done so that you
[49:11] could confess every sin on your bed
[49:13] before he take you he will do so and
[49:17] and he will fill you before you leave
[49:19] that's how faithful our God is because
[49:23] God said I've never lost one the
[49:29] circumcision Abraham was approved the
[49:32] Bible said abraham believed God and was
[49:34] counted unto him as righteousness that's
[49:36] justification but when God came about
[49:39] and circumcised Abraham that was mean
[49:42] that God approved of them now that that
[49:44] covenant is sealed don't you know I was
[49:50] in Abraham like Levi was in Abraham so
[49:56] as I and you must understand because he
[50:00] was circumcised I'm circumcised
[50:03] hallelujah you know it's amazing it
[50:14] meant so much because remember even when
[50:16] Stephen was being stoned he said you
[50:18] uncircumcised in the heart and ears you
[50:25] do always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[50:28] father did it so everybody that's in
[50:31] this message that resists the Holy Ghost
[50:33] they are not of our Father I don't
[50:42] understand because I know it's not
[50:44] something that you can work up but let
[50:45] me say it like this you need to pray
[50:48] until your faith can receive that you're
[50:50] the one is comfor see you gotta believe
[50:54] it is for you you can't doubt that
[50:58] that's why the Bible said come boldly
[51:00] before the throne of God you've got to
[51:03] believe that out of all the people in
[51:06] the world you have been ordained to
[51:08] receive the seal of the Holy Ghost
[51:10] that's the only way God can give it to
[51:13] you you have to have faith to believe
[51:15] that he is God and that he is a rewarder
[51:17] of those that diligently seek Him that's
[51:20] why the Prophet SAW said I don't care
[51:22] you come here I want you to shut in all
[51:24] night if it takes all night stay there
[51:27] till you get it he's not telling you to
[51:30] bed
[51:31] god he's trying to get you into an
[51:33] atmosphere where you can believe it's
[51:35] for you ah because most of us have seen
[51:39] we've done so many wrong things too
[51:41] sometimes we think there's not enough
[51:43] grace to cover us oh is that right
[51:47] but the man said a lot of people came up
[51:49] for prayer but they didn't get their
[51:50] healing because they felt unworthy he
[51:53] said but in the prostitute who come up
[51:54] because she knows she's unworthy and
[51:56] she'll be healed Christians didn't
[52:01] receive their healing because they felt
[52:03] unworthy of course you are but he made
[52:07] you worthy you and I must understand
[52:17] that when you're not circumcised you go
[52:24] to fellowship with people that are not
[52:26] circumcised you said what do you mean
[52:28] because birds of a feather flock
[52:30] together there is an attraction but
[52:36] those who got the Holy Ghost will
[52:39] fellowship with those with the Holy
[52:40] Ghost
[52:41] why because you've got something in
[52:44] common is that the truth
[52:49] the Bible said how can light and
[52:50] darkness mix together they can't do it
[52:59] they even know what it means to be in a
[53:02] horrible pit in about nowhere to be in
[53:06] harbour pit that means you have allowed
[53:08] the devil dirt and snare you and
[53:09] something and you can't get out of it
[53:11] and you want to get out of it
[53:12] God how could I get out of this
[53:15] situation
[53:15] I buy my ignorance have allowed Satan to
[53:18] ensnare me I'm trapped but God knows how
[53:25] to break the Fowler's snare
[53:28] he knows how to deliver you out of every
[53:31] temptation the Bible said merely are the
[53:34] affection of those who love him
[53:37] but God will deliver them out of all of
[53:40] them did y'all hear me
[53:42] many are the afflictions of the
[53:44] righteous but God will deliver you out
[53:46] all of them he's my deliverer David knew
[53:53] he said a horrible pit that means it was
[53:56] too deep too high and too wide for me to
[53:58] get out of it
[54:00] hallelujah but when you call upon the
[54:03] name of the Lord the Bible said that he
[54:06] will answer
[54:13] oh my III when I came to God I have I
[54:18] was in a lot of bondage it wouldn't have
[54:21] been wonderful of God if all of those
[54:23] change would have just dropped but they
[54:26] didn't all drop not at one time he did
[54:28] he let some arm drop just to let you
[54:30] know you've had an experience hallelujah
[54:34] but you're justified amen and that's a
[54:37] good feeling to be justified but you got
[54:40] to let the same Holy Ghost that justify
[54:42] you sanctify you hallelujah and when God
[54:48] began to sanctify you you say oh my god
[54:51] this feel really good now that I know
[54:53] that I don't have to do this and I don't
[54:55] have to do that and I don't have to do
[54:56] that and you know for that you didn't do
[54:59] it God don't need your help to be saying
[55:03] I sanctify you you know one moment with
[55:06] God can cleanse you like speaking span
[55:09] right but you got to get on your knees
[55:12] and seek the Lord for that cleansing is
[55:15] that one moment in the presence of God
[55:18] as I said Lord touch my lips and God did
[55:22] what he took the coal off the altar
[55:24] place it on his live sanctified
[55:26] amendment in a moment's time his worldly
[55:29] desires were gone being God broke him
[55:35] into a vision he saw those seraphim's
[55:38] crying holy holy holy y'all understand
[55:41] me Oh God you got a want to be clean
[55:44] though not just in your fresh in your
[55:47] mind in your spirit Lord sanctified me
[55:51] give me that new spirit a man but that's
[55:55] not the end of it
[55:57] you got another you got another
[55:59] experience coming hallelujah and then
[56:03] with that full baptism come amen you
[56:06] think oh my that feels good but it ain't
[56:10] it ain't over yet you still learning now
[56:14] you're in a position that God can teach
[56:17] you
[56:19] hallelujah is that right
[56:21] Abraham said come on and follow me Isaac
[56:23] I'm going to teach you a lesson
[56:26] what was that lesson you must become a
[56:28] tool of sacrifice in the hand of God in
[56:32] order to climb this mountain a what come
[56:42] on I don't remember the scripture where
[56:46] I just said Laura daddy where we going
[56:49] the only thing that Isaac asked was Lord
[56:51] where's the sacrifice and look what
[56:56] Abraham says he laid him on the wood
[57:02] because Abraham had made Isaac his
[57:04] sacrifice and it's Isaac willingly
[57:07] really gave himself to his father don't
[57:12] miss that part right
[57:14] it was a tight it was a type of God in
[57:17] Jesus is that right he he'd never mama
[57:23] and complained to his daddy even when he
[57:26] saw he was the one that he would diss
[57:28] daddy was going to sacrifice to God he
[57:30] never opened his mouth in Burma he went
[57:36] all the way up to the dramatic part of
[57:38] the night didn't ready to come down and
[57:40] Abraham God said Abraham Abraham
[57:45] standing that knife I have gotten myself
[57:50] a sacrifice you understand me
[57:54] but like a lamb Isaac win at the
[57:57] mountain with his daddy
[57:58] hallelujah and so of us if we're going
[58:01] to go up all the way up to through the
[58:03] completion of this thing you got to go
[58:05] like a lamb
[58:07] Lord Jesus whatever your will is I'll
[58:12] follow you it brings on an extreme
[58:16] pressure hallelujah you know it you know
[58:20] as you felt the pressure but he still
[58:24] wouldn't open his mouth why he trusted
[58:27] his dad
[58:29] do you trust you
[58:32] the Bible says trust the Lord with all
[58:35] your heart and lean not to your own
[58:37] understanding you gotta trust him a
[58:42] brother asked me a question today how
[58:44] I'm gonna get out of this I said well
[58:46] the only thing I know is you got to
[58:48] learn how to trust God because God I
[58:50] bring all kinds of stuff at you at one
[58:53] time and you don't know which way to
[58:55] swing the sword hallelujah but you got
[59:00] to understand that God's watching you oh
[59:05] the all-seeing eye is watching you I
[59:10] could J I'm taking it slow cuz I want
[59:13] you to get every little piece of what
[59:14] God is trying to say tonight you and I
[59:17] got a trust guard we know that the Lord
[59:20] is soon to come this is no time to fear
[59:22] it is time to have faith right
[59:25] faith will produce rejoicing faith will
[59:30] produce testimony fear would bring worry
[59:35] you understand me
[59:37] fear automatically bring worry faith
[59:41] brings victory you say well what do you
[59:44] mean the Bible said because of Abraham's
[59:47] faith he called those things that be not
[59:49] as though they were I'm talking about
[59:52] extreme pressure listen David was called
[59:59] by election he was elected call anointed
[1:00:03] and placed elected by God called from
[1:00:06] sheep herding to be the king an order to
[1:00:09] positionally plays you understand me and
[1:00:11] every individual that's in this bride is
[1:00:16] called by God anointed by God and placed
[1:00:21] by God it is not what you do it is what
[1:00:29] he is doing right how many are I know
[1:00:35] how often to say I know in my days we
[1:00:37] used to play with those toy soldiers I
[1:00:39] loved it and the Indians and all that
[1:00:40] and y'all don't heard this before but it
[1:00:43] was in your mind you deter
[1:00:44] who's gonna win sometimes the win
[1:00:50] Indians would win and sometime the
[1:00:52] Cowboys wouldn't it win it all depends
[1:00:54] what you were playing and in your mind
[1:00:57] what you wanted all right you take this
[1:00:59] anything he jump off the rock onto the
[1:01:01] the the cowboy y'all routes around
[1:01:04] whatever the case may be at the end time
[1:01:06] at the end the little toys didn't know
[1:01:09] what was gonna happen even if they had a
[1:01:11] mind they still didn't know what you had
[1:01:13] determined you determine the end I'm
[1:01:16] gonna say it like that again because
[1:01:18] right now you determine you say well how
[1:01:22] could I determine if I'm predestinated
[1:01:24] because you are predestinated according
[1:01:26] to your choice before it you made before
[1:01:29] the foundation of the world is this okay
[1:01:36] all these people don't expect that this
[1:01:40] road that we're working with I am
[1:01:41] excited I'm not excited that Billy
[1:01:44] Graham died but I'm excited that Billy
[1:01:46] Graham died if you understand what I'm
[1:01:51] saying because of what I feel I know now
[1:01:55] and look at what we're dealing with you
[1:01:58] got all these people talk about atomic
[1:02:00] bombs anybody in their right mind know
[1:02:03] that if you drop a hydrogen bomb there
[1:02:06] is no way to stop it
[1:02:08] how you gonna stop it pour some water on
[1:02:10] it it'll leak that water up like nothing
[1:02:15] your understanding we know that this
[1:02:18] world is going to burn because of man's
[1:02:21] technology hallelujah the prophet of God
[1:02:25] said that even in the days of entered
[1:02:27] the ant alluvion day it was the
[1:02:30] scientists that caused the explosion
[1:02:33] that tilted the world
[1:02:36] he said the intelligence of man always
[1:02:39] backfire always backfire you say what
[1:02:44] brother they weren't in tell her that
[1:02:45] they were cavemen you ought to be
[1:02:47] ashamed of yourself
[1:02:49] who built the pyramids right now
[1:02:53] in there right now they have the Arctic
[1:02:57] they're now exploring the Arctic because
[1:02:59] the ice is melting and now they're
[1:03:01] finally pyramids there and they found in
[1:03:05] palaces that Kings live dead no doubt
[1:03:09] they found in bodies too but they won't
[1:03:11] tell you that if they found the body of
[1:03:16] that mammoth it was a quick freeze when
[1:03:21] the world exploded and it tilted us back
[1:03:23] in the flood flipped like that it meant
[1:03:25] all everything that was there froze
[1:03:30] instantaneously but they gonna tell you
[1:03:33] hallelujah no what they only say we're
[1:03:36] all you know now we realize that we had
[1:03:38] some aliens from outer space and I'm
[1:03:42] telling you that's what they gonna say
[1:03:43] if they're not saying it already but we
[1:03:46] know the answer to their problem or
[1:03:48] equation we know what happened
[1:03:52] hallelujah and now we see science you
[1:03:56] know you after old God they working with
[1:03:58] this Collider they gonna they gonna
[1:04:00] cause up something to happen but I knew
[1:04:02] that it couldn't end that way because
[1:04:03] that's not the way the Bible says but my
[1:04:06] point is they just fidgety in the
[1:04:07] messing with science they in God's
[1:04:10] laboratory and it some some point is
[1:04:13] gonna flip back on them
[1:04:14] hallelujah somebody I guarantee you
[1:04:17] whoever dropped the bomb probably
[1:04:19] thought they done figured it out of my
[1:04:20] equation how they going to stop that
[1:04:22] that fire from burning and then gonna
[1:04:24] realize they've made a big mistake
[1:04:26] because when they drop a bomb like that
[1:04:29] they gonna be burnt too we living in the
[1:04:34] last days folks the angel the last angel
[1:04:39] disappeared to search your scripture
[1:04:41] when the angel disappeared the fire fell
[1:04:44] but we're so bad about it
[1:04:47] Locke didn't willfully come out the
[1:04:48] world he didn't fire he didn't with the
[1:04:51] Angels had to pull him out he didn't say
[1:04:56] oh I'm ready he was trying to find
[1:04:57] excuses just like his wife
[1:05:00] and that's what's wrong with a lot of
[1:05:02] Christians now they don't want to give
[1:05:04] up the world of things your time to tell
[1:05:06] them is getting ready to burn it's gonna
[1:05:08] happen just as sure as you feel you know
[1:05:10] yourself God's Word can never fail you
[1:05:14] bet it all didn't devastate you you got
[1:05:16] four time you don't have more time there
[1:05:19] does not be foolish this okay it's
[1:05:30] extreme pressure because remember the
[1:05:34] time when God was getting ready to
[1:05:36] destroy Egypt ahead instructed Moses
[1:05:40] make sure you put the blood on the
[1:05:42] doorpost in the left with those young
[1:05:44] kids you know they just listening to
[1:05:46] Daddy and mama says well it's gonna be
[1:05:48] safe we're gonna put the blood on the
[1:05:49] doorpost a little amen but when they
[1:05:51] start hearing the screams that was a
[1:05:54] different story when the Death Angel
[1:05:56] really came hallelujah those children
[1:05:59] says nothing are you sure are you sure
[1:06:03] next-door neighbor screaming are you
[1:06:06] sure you better be sure because you want
[1:06:13] to hear the noise we're getting ready to
[1:06:17] under growth of great pressure and
[1:06:19] without the Holy Ghost you're not gonna
[1:06:20] be able to stand that's why the foolish
[1:06:23] version will say give us off your oil
[1:06:25] and you know what I want to tell you
[1:06:27] every mother I told you about those
[1:06:28] prayer meetings remember I told you that
[1:06:30] you needed to pray and you wouldn't pray
[1:06:31] you go pray up hallelujah and what was
[1:06:35] so dis bad about it the Bible says they
[1:06:40] came to the door but the door was shut
[1:06:47] that's the scary part that you nearly
[1:06:50] had to alter crying and Boo asking God
[1:06:53] to give you the Holy Ghost that he won't
[1:06:54] even respond that's the scary part why
[1:06:57] because we were da Latorre
[1:06:59] hallelujah Amen we were procrastinators
[1:07:02] I got more time you don't have more time
[1:07:05] listen the death of this man has assured
[1:07:08] us in a way we was assured but we
[1:07:11] now the next move
[1:07:18] so what you're saying everybody just to
[1:07:21] the atomic age and everybody took my
[1:07:23] block bombing each other up and here's
[1:07:25] that old men over in Korea saying he got
[1:07:27] a big bomb and our president said well I
[1:07:29] got a big he can't help it he's ordained
[1:07:37] let me accept a toss-up y'all know what
[1:07:40] I'm talking about don't you know the
[1:07:41] Satan's eat what we expect you expect an
[1:07:45] angel in the president's or you expect
[1:07:48] that one president be a angel and and
[1:07:52] over here in Russia he's an angel no
[1:07:55] open your eyes I don't mean no harm they
[1:07:58] all like Nebuchadnezzar appointed and
[1:08:04] anointed to do the purpose and the will
[1:08:08] of God is that right you don't get up
[1:08:15] there in that position without training
[1:08:18] with the devil is that the word he told
[1:08:23] Jesus if you want to get higher I can
[1:08:25] give it to you all you got to do is bow
[1:08:27] to me listen what I'm saying it's not my
[1:08:35] power it's not by might but by my spirit
[1:08:38] saith the Lord and like I was telling a
[1:08:42] brother the other day I said you got to
[1:08:44] know who you are they called Jesus a
[1:08:48] devil he doesn't almighty called me a
[1:08:50] devil jesus knew who he was when
[1:08:54] somebody called you a devil
[1:08:56] Amen that ought to be bouncing off you
[1:08:57] because you realize you're to son and
[1:08:59] daughter of God nobody around here I
[1:09:03] can't put you in heaven nobody in here
[1:09:05] can put you in heaven this is between
[1:09:07] you and God
[1:09:09] the devil can put you in hell especially
[1:09:12] when you didn't come from there
[1:09:16] hell is not my whole y'all understand me
[1:09:22] we we've got to realize they meant
[1:09:25] tonight that this thing has been done by
[1:09:27] God it's not something you can do you
[1:09:30] cannot do this on your own you're not
[1:09:34] the Creator he's our Creator and if he
[1:09:37] created man in the beginning he must
[1:09:39] create man in the end he is the creator
[1:09:43] oh come on somebody you're not creating
[1:09:46] yourself
[1:09:46] he's creating you he's creating you who
[1:09:51] had nothing to do with it
[1:09:53] God created Adam you don't have nothing
[1:09:57] to do with it God is creating you oh you
[1:10:01] said well I got a good will to serve the
[1:10:03] Lord he gave you that none of us saw God
[1:10:07] God saw us he that begun a good work in
[1:10:11] you and faithful to complete it it ain't
[1:10:14] no time to hurry if the Bible said when
[1:10:17] you see that day approach and look up
[1:10:18] cuz your redemption draws nigh lift up
[1:10:24] your hands oh I don't know whether I'm
[1:10:29] gonna make no I've already made I'm just
[1:10:33] waiting for the change hallelujah and if
[1:10:37] I just had a close friend of mine died i
[1:10:39] I had planned to get there before he
[1:10:41] died but he had a few bad nights and I
[1:10:44] said to the Lord just was he yesterday
[1:10:46] he died out with it the day he died I
[1:10:48] was just praying I said all I loved him
[1:10:51] I said you know Lord I said if he's
[1:10:54] already ready I said just take him no
[1:10:57] don't let him suffer suffer buddy if
[1:10:59] he's not because he had backslidden but
[1:11:01] he had come back to Lord and I said but
[1:11:04] Lord if he's ready
[1:11:05] then just take him Lord see if he's not
[1:11:08] then hold until I get there so I can
[1:11:10] pray for you know 15 minutes John he was
[1:11:16] supposed to have
[1:11:17] six months to live ah boy huh yeah y'all
[1:11:22] don't understand I don't know whether
[1:11:25] you see it or not but God heard my
[1:11:27] prayer I don't like the devil tormenting
[1:11:30] God's people like that I don't know I
[1:11:34] know I can't understand it oh my when
[1:11:38] you know you're secured and the Bob said
[1:11:40] make your calling in action sure when
[1:11:42] you are secure and assured when God
[1:11:45] knocks on my door say brother Bruce are
[1:11:47] you ready you want to wait around for 15
[1:11:49] minutes not even take me now oh my my
[1:11:59] daughter called me the other day we
[1:12:01] talked maybe the day I get dates mixed
[1:12:03] up and she said this young man died
[1:12:06] about 15 16 years old he died and the
[1:12:09] relatives are angry at God and McNair
[1:12:11] and I talked to hold her eyes I said
[1:12:14] none consider why the Lord put the
[1:12:18] righteous to sleep don't you know
[1:12:21] sometimes people die God takes them to
[1:12:24] keep them from the evil that is to come
[1:12:28] let me ask you a question if God would
[1:12:32] say hey you know you're gonna make a
[1:12:34] wrap or whatever the case may be but I'm
[1:12:36] gonna put you to sleep so you won't have
[1:12:38] to experience some of the pressure
[1:12:40] that's coming before the rapture hello
[1:12:44] y'all I don't understand why people we
[1:12:49] hold on to this devilish world and like
[1:12:52] we love tall men I don't like to be
[1:12:56] tormented I don't like these battles in
[1:12:59] my mind but what about all your children
[1:13:04] somebody left me here they did and you
[1:13:14] gonna leave somebody - you know we can't
[1:13:18] save nobody
[1:13:22] hmm this
[1:13:25] according to the scripture Psalm 4043
[1:13:28] says we have heard with our ears Oh God
[1:13:31] our fathers have told us what works thou
[1:13:34] didst in their days in the times of old
[1:13:37] how thou didst drive out the heathen
[1:13:41] with our hand and planted them how dog
[1:13:44] did afflict the people and cast them out
[1:13:46] for they got they got not the land in
[1:13:50] possession by their own sword neither
[1:13:52] did their own arms save them but that
[1:13:55] right hand died armed and the light of
[1:13:58] that countenance because thou hath a
[1:14:01] favour unto death here is somebody don't
[1:14:07] you understand the only reason why you
[1:14:10] getting this good treatment is because
[1:14:11] God favors you you don't call it good
[1:14:16] treatment the Bible said blessed is the
[1:14:18] man that heareth the word of God blessed
[1:14:25] is the man that reads and hear the word
[1:14:28] of God blessed when the devil say I'm
[1:14:32] cursed no I cannot be cursed because He
[1:14:35] blessed me hallelujah somebody else
[1:14:41] perhaps could have been standing in my
[1:14:43] place
[1:14:43] but not so hallelujah could have been
[1:14:47] standing in your place but not soul who
[1:14:52] extreme pressure we got to learn how to
[1:14:55] handle it better
[1:14:59] absolutely David said the Lord is my
[1:15:02] light and my salvation whom shall I fear
[1:15:08] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[1:15:11] whom shall I be afraid
[1:15:12] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:15:16] foes came upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:15:19] they stumbled and fell now every time I
[1:15:23] see this I would think about when Jesus
[1:15:25] was giving it to the council and to say
[1:15:28] all of these soldiers and all they came
[1:15:30] to grab Jesus and when they got close to
[1:15:32] him they fell backwards I'm like Lord
[1:15:35] one of these old days
[1:15:38] hallelujah the same Jesus that made him
[1:15:41] fall backwards in his day would be the
[1:15:43] same either that'll make him fall
[1:15:45] backwards in our day I believe that we
[1:15:48] don't have to fear what's coming upon
[1:15:49] the earth hallelujah the one hosting
[1:15:54] cats shouldn't camp against me my heart
[1:15:56] should not fear the war should rise
[1:15:58] against me in this will I be confident
[1:16:01] one thing I've desired of the Lord that
[1:16:04] will I seek after one thing
[1:16:06] not so much all these other things
[1:16:09] hallelujah some of y'all y'all some of
[1:16:15] y'all who was single y'all might not
[1:16:17] understand it but I tell you what
[1:16:18] it's alright to be single because now
[1:16:21] you don't have to worry about a wife
[1:16:22] call up miss LA you understand me
[1:16:29] oh I'm walking by myself it's better cuz
[1:16:34] now you don't have to worry about some
[1:16:36] other I know that sound crew who but
[1:16:40] it's the truth you don't think it was an
[1:16:46] extreme pressure or not we're not
[1:16:51] constantly trying to keep his wife from
[1:16:53] looking back I don't know whether using
[1:16:57] the front aback but wherever he was I
[1:16:58] think she was in front of him cuz as a
[1:17:00] gentleman you put your wife first and
[1:17:04] he's probably trying to tell her don't
[1:17:05] look back honey or whatever you do don't
[1:17:06] look back and she stops said no honey
[1:17:09] don't do it and then she just glimpse
[1:17:16] how do you think he felt you know he
[1:17:19] felt bad because after it was all over
[1:17:22] the man got drunk trying to wash away
[1:17:25] his memory of his wife dying instantly
[1:17:31] and you guess
[1:17:33] she was thinking about her loved ones
[1:17:34] that she left behind ah y'all understand
[1:17:41] hey when I'm change I'm not looking
[1:17:45] nowhere but up it had to be hard on him
[1:17:53] extreme pressure wherever she was if she
[1:17:58] was in front of him it was almost in a
[1:18:00] way a good thing because he could see it
[1:18:02] happen if he was he was behind him
[1:18:05] can you express can you imagine it the
[1:18:07] extreme pressure he had to keep from
[1:18:11] looking back for his wife god have mercy
[1:18:16] but he knew what the angel said don't
[1:18:21] look was I brought you out of Sodom
[1:18:25] don't look back don't let that desire of
[1:18:30] what used to be overtake you why because
[1:18:34] that same desire will cause you to mr.
[1:18:37] rapture and you will experience a hot
[1:18:40] atmosphere you will become atomic father
[1:18:47] for in the time of trouble he oh one
[1:18:52] thing I've desired of the Lord that will
[1:18:53] I seek after that I may dwell in the
[1:18:55] house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:18:56] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:18:58] and to enquire in his temple for in a
[1:19:01] time of trouble he should hide me in his
[1:19:02] pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:19:04] shall he hide me he just set me upon a
[1:19:07] rock somebody sent me or YouTube thing
[1:19:12] about this man or this uh broadcaster
[1:19:17] from Israel you know what he said he was
[1:19:21] talking my Billy Graham's death he said
[1:19:25] he had just had a dream about Billy
[1:19:30] Graham and he said in his dream he saw
[1:19:34] Billy Graham died just before the
[1:19:36] rapture
[1:19:40] yeah Israeli yeah he was the Israeli
[1:19:44] folks now you said well how can this be
[1:19:47] cheap God is moving God is moving he
[1:19:53] said he and he said he had never I don't
[1:19:56] know when he said he heard it before he
[1:19:58] had heard but he I guess he did a little
[1:20:00] research and he saw where somebody was
[1:20:03] saying that this was significant to the
[1:20:05] rapture and he thought it was something
[1:20:08] interesting because he had had the dream
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:13] we didn't have a dream we had a vision
[1:20:17] hallelujah and let me say it like this
[1:20:19] whether it happened tonight or tomorrow
[1:20:21] it's going to happen this is the day I
[1:20:25] don't know how long this time spent but
[1:20:28] listen I actually live with brother
[1:20:30] brother Tom Brown and system not lived
[1:20:32] but they were part of my congregation
[1:20:35] brother Tom Brown and bill doll y'all
[1:20:38] remember Bill Dowd brother Bevin talked
[1:20:39] about him a lot amen and and sister
[1:20:42] Marilyn and some of the other oldest
[1:20:44] Saints were around brother Branham told
[1:20:46] me this said that brother Branham told
[1:20:49] them this is not on record I'm not
[1:20:50] saying it's on record because it's not
[1:20:52] but he personally told them he told them
[1:20:55] that it would be one early Eastown one
[1:21:01] early Easter and and and this is the
[1:21:05] earliest that I know of and guess what
[1:21:08] day it falls on April 1st April Fool's
[1:21:11] Day I'm not saying it but what if it is
[1:21:17] how many of us are ready one body
[1:21:23] somebody said to me well you know how
[1:21:25] can that be because it's going to be 30
[1:21:27] days before it is I said now listen 30
[1:21:29] to 40 days dirt they get up they can get
[1:21:33] up on Easter right and you have 30 to 40
[1:21:38] days to go before then right because
[1:21:42] Easter is the resurrection day
[1:21:44] hallelujah and think about it it is on
[1:21:49] the 1st of April
[1:21:51] I don't know I'm not saying it is and
[1:21:57] I'm not bringing a forecast but what I'm
[1:21:59] trying to show you that it's closer than
[1:22:01] what you think you know I'm not going
[1:22:08] predicted because the Bible said no man
[1:22:10] know that they know now but he didn't
[1:22:12] say we wouldn't know the week or the
[1:22:16] year so you better y'all better
[1:22:22] understand it's later than what we think
[1:22:24] and like I said even if it doesn't
[1:22:25] happen until whatever it is still being
[1:22:28] the same day because I can say that day
[1:22:30] is a time somebody said well don't you
[1:22:38] know we have a lot of things that
[1:22:39] happened the Prophet God said years ago
[1:22:42] God can make a rapture right now still
[1:22:44] be scripturally right I believe I'm
[1:22:51] translation saying you don't have to
[1:22:55] believe it if you don't want to I
[1:22:57] believe it in 1977 I didn't know nothing
[1:23:01] about this message absolutely nothing
[1:23:04] and it was the first time I saw UFOs I
[1:23:07] saw them you don't have to believe me
[1:23:10] but I did and I know that what I saw has
[1:23:13] been let's see you go into YouTube and
[1:23:17] you see these things moving that's what
[1:23:19] I saw you know what I was in an
[1:23:21] Apostolic Church outside the church
[1:23:24] jumping I couldn't help it something
[1:23:27] struck me and I was jumping and shouting
[1:23:29] and praising God and you know what I was
[1:23:31] saying Lord whatever you do don't let me
[1:23:34] miss the rapture I didn't know nothing
[1:23:39] about that kind of stuff and then
[1:23:42] shortly after that here come the message
[1:23:48] maybe I'm foolish but it's okay it's
[1:23:51] what I believe it's more than I believe
[1:23:55] I don't know how to explain it but I'm
[1:23:57] gonna share something I got to hurry up
[1:23:58] here
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:03] now them talks about the tit vision how
[1:24:07] many all know that it's been a doctrine
[1:24:10] all kind of stuff but I told y'all just
[1:24:13] not long ago I said you know I had a
[1:24:15] dream did I tell the dream here
[1:24:18] i'ma tell it again it was more than a
[1:24:21] dream I don't know what they called it
[1:24:23] but a dream but I was in my house and I
[1:24:26] was in my bed and I was getting ready to
[1:24:28] go to sleep all of a sudden Satan star
[1:24:30] bombard in my mind with sexual thoughts
[1:24:32] trying to get me to receive it and I
[1:24:34] said oh god I said whatever you do if
[1:24:36] I'm gonna dream don't let me dream these
[1:24:39] words almost verbatim don't let me dream
[1:24:41] of evil things and I close my eyes
[1:24:45] people before I knew it all I know is I
[1:24:48] slayed down I closed my eyes and when I
[1:24:50] closed my eyes I saw two angels coming
[1:24:53] down from heaven
[1:24:54] both of these angels and I don't know
[1:24:57] where the other one went but once stayed
[1:24:58] with me and this angel began to talk to
[1:25:02] me now let me say this I would not risk
[1:25:06] my salvation to tell you a lie because
[1:25:11] what you're gonna do for me after I tell
[1:25:14] you this dream ain't nothing you're
[1:25:15] gonna do for me right and so I'm telling
[1:25:19] it as a dream because that's what it was
[1:25:20] I've had supernatural experiences many
[1:25:23] times but this dream he began to tell me
[1:25:26] how God much God loved me and dissin any
[1:25:29] other was a lot of things happening at
[1:25:31] that time I had an experience like this
[1:25:33] when I was in Lima I was caught up into
[1:25:34] a life you don't have to believe it I'm
[1:25:36] not trying to be anything I'm just
[1:25:38] telling you an experience you don't have
[1:25:41] to believe it but it happened and in
[1:25:43] that light when we were having that
[1:25:44] revival going on God spoke some powerful
[1:25:47] things to me I mean for days I was drunk
[1:25:49] in the spirit laughing and crying at the
[1:25:51] same time and thought I was going to
[1:25:53] explode because of the power of God well
[1:25:55] the same this ain't began to talk to me
[1:25:57] and everything else I'm gonna tell you
[1:25:59] it was so beautiful and I'm not I'm not
[1:26:01] going to fully describe it but I'll just
[1:26:02] say he was dressed in Eagles feathers I
[1:26:07] don't know how you would make a garment
[1:26:10] out of eagles feathers but that's what
[1:26:13] he was and he
[1:26:14] part of his garment that looked like
[1:26:16] lamb's wool all I know well I thought
[1:26:19] about while I was dreaming whatever that
[1:26:21] was I thought about Martin when the
[1:26:24] angel came down and and that angel tried
[1:26:26] to see who Martin worship me worship me
[1:26:29] so I said there's an angel I said you're
[1:26:33] not trying to deceive me oh you don't
[1:26:35] think you're gonna deceive me you're not
[1:26:37] trying to deceive me
[1:26:38] you know I said because I can only love
[1:26:41] the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't say
[1:26:45] anything so I got up I realized I was
[1:26:48] dreaming I guess because I got up and
[1:26:49] had to go to the restroom I'm home and I
[1:26:52] was dreaming so I came back from the
[1:26:54] restroom laid my head down and he was
[1:26:56] still there that's all I could tell you
[1:26:59] he was still there so I said to him I
[1:27:02] thought about perfection I thought three
[1:27:05] is perfection so let me tell him this
[1:27:06] again I say don't you know I can only
[1:27:09] love the Lord Jesus Christ I said it a
[1:27:13] second time
[1:27:14] don't you know emphatically a little you
[1:27:17] know I can only love the Lord Jesus
[1:27:19] Christ he smiled at me and he left but I
[1:27:23] had this feeling he's gonna return he's
[1:27:26] gonna return well I went to brother
[1:27:29] Yvonne's Church shortly after that
[1:27:32] hadn't mentioned nothing to him
[1:27:34] he's just started talking he said
[1:27:37] brother Brooks he said just a few weeks
[1:27:39] ago I had this brother from Russia or in
[1:27:41] the area Russia wasn't exactly Russia he
[1:27:43] said and and he preached he went to the
[1:27:46] back of the door and all of a sudden the
[1:27:47] angel showed up he said he said I was so
[1:27:50] terrified I was behind the pulpit there
[1:27:53] you know at the time of the altar call
[1:27:55] he said I was behind me I was so scared
[1:27:56] I crawled into the pulpit he said and
[1:27:58] while I crawled into the I can still see
[1:28:01] the angel behind me don't you know that
[1:28:03] man described the very angel I saw to a
[1:28:07] tee he said and then the brother
[1:28:12] the brother who preached saw the angel
[1:28:14] and the angel moved out of the pulpit
[1:28:16] went down and touched one sister there
[1:28:18] at the altar she received the Holy Ghost
[1:28:20] and then all of a sudden the powerful of
[1:28:22] God just fell in the place
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:24] [Applause]
[1:28:27] I'm telling you my experience but let me
[1:28:31] tell you this last dream this last dream
[1:28:34] and I didn't understand it so I'm on how
[1:28:36] am i explaining it to you because I
[1:28:37] think I told you about this I'm telling
[1:28:38] you they're like a dream folks it's a
[1:28:39] dream in this dream I've never dreamt
[1:28:42] about brother branham the whole time
[1:28:45] I've been in this message
[1:28:46] I've never dreamed about it but this
[1:28:48] time I had a dream it was on a Saturday
[1:28:50] night and brother Branham was preaching
[1:28:53] all that was in this building we were in
[1:28:56] a building and everybody was dressed in
[1:28:57] white
[1:28:58] all of a sudden half of the people left
[1:29:01] and they rushed out of the building I
[1:29:02] didn't know what they were rushing out
[1:29:03] so I rushed it where'd it going
[1:29:06] I got in my car I tried to to catch up
[1:29:08] with him but while I was travelling
[1:29:10] there was a black convertible and I
[1:29:14] almost hit that car and I kind of turned
[1:29:17] and when I turned I looked and it was
[1:29:19] one of my sisters who had going on
[1:29:21] before but I'm a natural sister says he
[1:29:24] just smiled at me but that turn made me
[1:29:27] you turn like this and took me right
[1:29:30] back to where brother Branham was
[1:29:31] preaching so when I got there back there
[1:29:35] like they were waiting on me so when
[1:29:37] they when they wait when I saw them
[1:29:39] waiting on me they did this one number
[1:29:41] and they turn uniformly they just turned
[1:29:43] toward the west brother branham looked
[1:29:47] at me and he started freaking there will
[1:29:49] be a tent meeting there will be a tent
[1:29:51] meeting there will be a tip meeting well
[1:29:53] that confused me and then I woke up tent
[1:29:57] meeting now I'm gonna explain it to you
[1:30:00] so what happened was on January 31st
[1:30:05] I called brother Jesse Smith I said
[1:30:08] brother Jesse you don't have to send me
[1:30:10] a gift for my birthday
[1:30:12] I'll just messing with him I said ah but
[1:30:17] I would love to talk to you so Jesse
[1:30:20] called me and I started talking and I
[1:30:23] start telling him about my dream then I
[1:30:25] told him my dream he's a brother but
[1:30:26] when you had that dream so I had to
[1:30:28] think about it I said it was Saturday
[1:30:30] he's a brother he said I dreamed about
[1:30:32] brother branham - that same night he
[1:30:35] said I've never dreamed a trip about
[1:30:37] brother branham right and he said I said
[1:30:42] brother branham I said why we don't see
[1:30:44] all the miracles and the signs and the
[1:30:46] wonders that the acts Church was doing
[1:30:49] you know I've been faithful I've been
[1:30:51] fasting so he said went down the line
[1:30:53] just short saying what the works he had
[1:30:55] done
[1:30:56] you know what the Prophet said to him he
[1:30:58] said because you haven't given me all of
[1:31:00] your heart he said then I understood I
[1:31:07] needed to pray more that's why we're not
[1:31:12] seeing nothing we haven't given God all
[1:31:15] of our hearts now why would God have me
[1:31:19] call as man and we talk about the same
[1:31:20] thing
[1:31:21] so I said brother I said he said but
[1:31:23] brother Brooks he said don't you know
[1:31:24] brother Branham explained the tip
[1:31:26] meeting I said no he said he did it he
[1:31:30] said brother Randy saya showed me a
[1:31:31] quote where he explained what that was
[1:31:33] and he sent it to me so I'm gonna read
[1:31:36] it to you is that okay
[1:31:39] you know the Prophet God States people
[1:31:41] went into this tent and they came out on
[1:31:43] the other side home I'm gonna start with
[1:31:46] this one sister because it was a lone
[1:31:47] quote she said I just don't know she
[1:31:49] said I couldn't tell you what happened
[1:31:52] she said I have been paralyzed for 20
[1:31:54] years and lookie I never was sick right
[1:31:58] he says now here's something notice
[1:32:02] close there's a difference between the
[1:32:03] angel of the Lord in that light because
[1:32:06] I heard something I'm moving as it does
[1:32:09] when it comes here at the platform at
[1:32:11] night kind of like oh and like afar
[1:32:15] whipping around licking blaze and it
[1:32:18] left me and it went right down over the
[1:32:21] top of that audience and went and stood
[1:32:23] over the top of that little building
[1:32:25] then settle down on top of it and then
[1:32:29] when it did this one that was standing
[1:32:31] by me behind me the same voice the angel
[1:32:34] voice he said I'll meet you in there and
[1:32:37] this is the turret pool but nobody
[1:32:39] wouldn't know nothing about it and I
[1:32:44] said well I don't understand why is
[1:32:46] there why that he said I will not it
[1:32:50] will not be a public show
[1:32:51] this time and I said I don't understand
[1:32:54] going into that closet like that and he
[1:32:57] said it's not written is it not written
[1:33:01] by our Lord when thou pray be not like
[1:33:05] the hypocrites who like to be heard
[1:33:07] before men but enter into the secret
[1:33:10] closet and pray to the Father who see it
[1:33:13] in secret and he who see it in secret
[1:33:16] shall reward thee openly it's perfectly
[1:33:18] to the scripture everything it is and I
[1:33:21] said I understand then it took me to
[1:33:24] this place and set me down in this room
[1:33:26] where I was at and then he told me that
[1:33:28] what to do for the third time now
[1:33:30] Christian's friends that that will that
[1:33:34] will when I leave this world that will
[1:33:37] still be in my bosom when I he said but
[1:33:39] you mark my word what's going to take
[1:33:41] place so in other words if you want to
[1:33:44] see the third pool that closet that that
[1:33:48] that that that rule is your closet as
[1:33:52] individuals it will not be an open show
[1:33:55] it will be you and your closet think
[1:33:59] about it if you in your closet and
[1:34:02] you've got high blood pressure or you
[1:34:04] got one leg and you don't met God in
[1:34:07] that closet and all of a sudden you try
[1:34:09] to get up and you got both of your legs
[1:34:11] see that's what he's working with that's
[1:34:17] what he's working with God himself
[1:34:22] that's why he said there's a difference
[1:34:24] between the light and that angel because
[1:34:30] it was the light that stood over the
[1:34:33] building when the purifier comes and
[1:34:36] visit you while you're praying that's
[1:34:40] what he's talking about that's why he
[1:34:45] said they're built three times he said
[1:34:47] to me and now I understood when he he
[1:34:50] told but he said brother that means
[1:34:52] prayer when he showed me that it just
[1:34:54] something lifted I said yes Lord I'm
[1:34:57] guilty
[1:34:58] I haven't been praying like I ought to
[1:35:05] whoo now I know what to look for this is
[1:35:17] not for everybody
[1:35:18] you ought to be so blessed that God
[1:35:19] visited me it ain't brother Brooks for
[1:35:24] God's telling you something I believe
[1:35:29] that with all my heart I wasn't gonna
[1:35:32] even say nothing about it until God
[1:35:34] instructed me put that in your message
[1:35:36] well because you gonna need this and I
[1:35:40] believe if we started really going in
[1:35:42] our prayer clouds and stop timing
[1:35:43] ourselves don't worry about an hour or
[1:35:47] two hours just get down to Jesus show up
[1:35:54] is that right because that's where the
[1:35:57] food defender says you give us up your
[1:35:58] all and we responded you go pray up
[1:36:04] listen we got God on our side I'm almost
[1:36:06] done we got God on our side and don't
[1:36:10] you know is it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:12] that makes intercession for our
[1:36:15] ignorance now we've been ignorant
[1:36:17] ignorant not long enough folks the Bible
[1:36:20] said God wants winked but in you know
[1:36:22] he's that that's what's helping us
[1:36:24] because God the Lord Jesus is saying
[1:36:26] Lord didn't mean to do it
[1:36:28] no let's just stay there English they
[1:36:29] don't understand what that's all about
[1:36:31] they don't know they don't understand
[1:36:32] how devastating that is to their real
[1:36:34] relationship or whatever the case may be
[1:36:36] he's the one pleading for us is that the
[1:36:39] right the Bible said when you don't know
[1:36:41] how to pray the Holy Ghost were making a
[1:36:44] sentence for you we've done a lot of
[1:36:49] things called ourselves right we've done
[1:36:50] a lot of ignorant stuff that could
[1:36:53] literally cause us our soul why do we
[1:36:55] still live because the blood prevails
[1:37:02] hallelujah I have been elected so you
[1:37:05] have been elected to be predestinated to
[1:37:07] be what the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:37:10] hallelujah who are you brother roots I
[1:37:13] am the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:37:16] I say it humbly but that's who I am you
[1:37:23] can't make the scripture you can't break
[1:37:24] the scripture you cannot break the
[1:37:27] scripture people everything that vision
[1:37:31] dream whatever it has to be scriptural
[1:37:33] and if it's not leave it alone I could
[1:37:37] only tell you about dream and like I
[1:37:38] said I didn't know what it meant but I
[1:37:40] do now
[1:37:41] I think I cut off some of that quote so
[1:37:43] if you want to hear let me see where
[1:37:45] where did I get it from what I just read
[1:37:50] it what is that what is a vision 1956
[1:38:00] 408 if you want to hear all of it
[1:38:04] listen to all of it let God give you
[1:38:07] what he means on that because he said it
[1:38:11] has to happen and so when he said there
[1:38:14] will be I mean I've been I don't
[1:38:18] understand that God had brother Jesse to
[1:38:23] have the other part of the dream and
[1:38:24] they both go to you same night
[1:38:30] listen on Joseph or die maker is dying
[1:38:33] husband the Lord of Hosts is his name
[1:38:36] and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel
[1:38:40] the god of the whole earth shall he be
[1:38:44] called what so I came from God I go back
[1:38:49] to God he is my husband in the beginning
[1:38:52] ours is feminine part at the end
[1:38:58] I'm his feminine part you said what do
[1:39:01] you mean
[1:39:02] listen revelations 21 9 3:11 says and
[1:39:06] there came unto me one of the seven
[1:39:08] angels which has seven vials full of
[1:39:10] seven last plagues and talked with me
[1:39:12] calm and Saint cut us totally saying
[1:39:16] come here the I will show you the bride
[1:39:19] the Lambs wife I'm not just a bride but
[1:39:23] I'm the Lambs wife
[1:39:28] oh come on somebody I'm both of them
[1:39:38] y'all know what I'm saying in this
[1:39:41] earthly place you know when the ladies
[1:39:42] are bribed we treated different
[1:39:44] until she become the wife but God says
[1:39:47] no she'll never betrayed t treated
[1:39:49] different she's my wife and my bride
[1:39:51] come on Oh y'all don't let me shout for
[1:40:00] you whoo oh oh you know I love the Lord
[1:40:03] because you know he's so good to us I've
[1:40:07] always wanted to know myself what that
[1:40:10] tip cuz it wasn't scripturally lining up
[1:40:13] I'm like the propagate add to it God can
[1:40:15] add to it I said it's gotta be somewhere
[1:40:17] there in the world it goes all the way
[1:40:22] back to Sarah
[1:40:24] I mean scuse me yeah is that right when
[1:40:27] Isaac got Rebecca where does he take her
[1:40:29] into his mother's 10 that's with a
[1:40:34] consecration kicker consummation was
[1:40:37] made in the prayer closet because you
[1:40:43] can't die God into this natural sexual
[1:40:44] thing you got to take him into the
[1:40:46] spiritual huh it was in the tent
[1:40:49] Oh Lord
[1:40:56] Mercy Mercy Mercy y'all understand me
[1:40:58] extreme you can't God cannot produce its
[1:41:02] goods without the pressure being there
[1:41:07] extreme pressure must come now it's when
[1:41:13] when I'm tried in the fire I shall come
[1:41:17] out like pure gold so we must be tried
[1:41:21] all of these things are working for your
[1:41:24] good is that right the Bombers had a
[1:41:27] just man should fall seven times in a
[1:41:29] day but it gets up don't think you're
[1:41:32] gonna walk in that fall sometimes we do
[1:41:35] fall
[1:41:36] but just as soon as we fall we get up is
[1:41:42] that right
[1:41:43] brother Alan said we we are we backslide
[1:41:46] every day anybody anybody know what I'm
[1:41:49] talking about huh Esther was under
[1:41:54] extreme pressure when she found out that
[1:41:59] Mordecai
[1:42:00] that Haman was going to kill the people
[1:42:03] how you thinking listen let me tell you
[1:42:05] something what
[1:42:06] how did Esther Odessa how did the
[1:42:10] decibel come Esther it was a lot of
[1:42:13] pressure a lot of pressure she had to
[1:42:17] come to a place Amen that she had to
[1:42:19] watch everything she did right what
[1:42:22] anointed her what made her want to be
[1:42:25] queen because maybe in the beginning I'm
[1:42:27] thinking took a change one thing I love
[1:42:33] about Elsa is that she never went for
[1:42:35] the worldliness of all the other women
[1:42:38] she kept her identity hallelujah
[1:42:42] she wasn't about all the foolishness of
[1:42:44] the world and all of the glamour of the
[1:42:46] world she kept herself clean and pure
[1:42:49] and as simple as she possibly could and
[1:42:51] listen she she was always interested in
[1:42:54] what the King likes no matter what the
[1:42:58] cause I want to know what God likes is
[1:43:01] that right and that chamber meant a mint
[1:43:04] that was her teacher guess what that's
[1:43:06] what the prophet of God is to us because
[1:43:09] he tells us all the things that God
[1:43:11] likes I know y'all don't heard this
[1:43:15] before but it's feel good to me
[1:43:19] hallelujah and at the time that she was
[1:43:21] supposed to show listen God rushed her
[1:43:24] into that place and you think once you
[1:43:26] get in the king's palace and everything
[1:43:28] is gonna be alright once I become
[1:43:30] adopted and all that everything's gonna
[1:43:31] be alright oh you got some more trouble
[1:43:33] coming more trouble she's in the king
[1:43:38] palace and into her her father my father
[1:43:43] loved her uncle said unto her don't you
[1:43:46] think you got to me because
[1:43:50] in the king's palace don't forget you
[1:43:54] still a Jew hallelujah if those people
[1:43:59] would have known what a Jew supposed to
[1:44:01] be like she would have been uncovered
[1:44:03] earlier on but God blinded them hmm oh
[1:44:10] my and you look at this thing and she
[1:44:13] said oh oh oh what must I do didn't the
[1:44:15] Lord show she said well I hadn't been
[1:44:17] summons if I if he don't summons me I'm
[1:44:19] gonna be killed because it's against the
[1:44:21] law if the Queen should coming for the
[1:44:22] King and she's not summons but she said
[1:44:25] I'm breaking this law today she was on
[1:44:28] the extreme pressure but guess what you
[1:44:31] understand when you're under such
[1:44:32] pressure you must be willing to become
[1:44:34] the sacrifice because she she was
[1:44:38] willing to become the sacrifice in order
[1:44:41] for her people to live did Jesus do that
[1:44:47] yeah he the opportunity to get married
[1:44:49] he had all those opportunities but Jesus
[1:44:52] and I sanctify myself that ye may be
[1:44:55] sanctified so don't tell me you can't be
[1:44:58] sanctified if you got no holy ghost if
[1:44:59] you got the Holy Ghost you can be
[1:45:01] sanctified because he synched if I do
[1:45:03] when he sanctified himself right it's
[1:45:06] the truth
[1:45:07] anyway she says listen go gather all
[1:45:10] together all the Jews that are present
[1:45:12] in the Shushan and fast ye for me and
[1:45:15] neither eat or drink three days night
[1:45:17] all day I also in my Mane's with fast
[1:45:20] likewise and so when I go unto the king
[1:45:22] which are not according to the law and
[1:45:23] if I perish I perish man I call a fast
[1:45:29] here don't you eat nothing for three
[1:45:34] days oh my goodness I wonder who can
[1:45:37] make it Oh Lord I shouldn't be laughing
[1:45:42] but the truth is those people believed
[1:45:45] in Esther hallelujah
[1:45:49] don't you understand she was like
[1:45:51] standing in the gap for her people it's
[1:45:55] like the bride of Jesus Christ standing
[1:45:57] in the midst of the golden candlesticks
[1:46:00] oh that's what he said
[1:46:06] Mordecai went his way and did according
[1:46:08] to all that Esther had commanded fresh
[1:46:10] ah you know and we understand by the
[1:46:14] message that it's going to be heated
[1:46:16] seven times hotter Shadrach Meshach and
[1:46:19] Abednego hallelujah we get ready repeat
[1:46:22] it man the pressure is coming from the
[1:46:26] government if you do not worship under
[1:46:29] this organization or denomination we are
[1:46:32] going to throw you into the fire
[1:46:34] hallelujah
[1:46:36] hey and the prophet of God brings out
[1:46:38] something he said they never got an
[1:46:40] answer from God even though they prayed
[1:46:42] yes there was no breakthrough hallelujah
[1:46:46] but they said nevertheless he's able to
[1:46:50] deliver us and if he doesn't deliver us
[1:46:54] I know well enough I'm not bowing to the
[1:46:58] devil I'm not bowing to your image
[1:47:01] because that image is the mark of the
[1:47:03] beast
[1:47:05] it has mongrelized the Word of God
[1:47:13] think about pressure here Jesus is
[1:47:16] saying they always come I'm almost done
[1:47:21] the highways come before the Son of Man
[1:47:28] is betrayed into the hands of the
[1:47:30] sinner's rise and let us go what was he
[1:47:34] saying he that betrayeth me is at hand I
[1:47:37] asked you to pray with me for three
[1:47:39] hours see with prayer come here I
[1:47:41] thought that you pray with me three
[1:47:44] hours I can't it ain't him in a few
[1:47:46] hours
[1:47:46] and y'all sleeping on the job where is
[1:47:49] my help
[1:47:50] see he's speaking like a man now because
[1:47:55] the Holy Spirit is departed he said no
[1:47:58] sir why did the angel have to come back
[1:48:00] and strengthen him so though he's there
[1:48:04] in the garden pleading for you and me he
[1:48:07] sweated he prayed and prayed so
[1:48:09] vehemently till his sweat was like drops
[1:48:11] of blood follow you
[1:48:14] ah hallelujah the Bible said he said his
[1:48:19] face like a flint hallelujah and for the

[1:51:28] Fanny Crosby what was her name that was
[1:51:31] her name to write her any crosby when
[1:51:34] they wanted her to sing right for rock
[1:51:36] and roll she wouldn't do it

[1:51:40] to get her to sell her birthright says
[1:51:41] hey what have you get there and you
[1:51:43] still blind she says I shall know him I

[1:52:40] the power may be of God and not of us
[1:52:47] hmm
[1:52:48] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:52:51] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:52:54] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:52:57] down but not destroyed always bearing in
[1:53:01] about in our body the dying of the Lord
[1:53:03] Jesus that the life of also of Jesus
[1:53:06] might be made manifest in in our body
[1:53:08] but we which live are always delivered
[1:53:11] unto death for Jesus say that the life
[1:53:13] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:53:16] our mortal flesh
[1:53:17] I understand that that means we killed
[1:53:20] our desires that only Jesus can be seen
