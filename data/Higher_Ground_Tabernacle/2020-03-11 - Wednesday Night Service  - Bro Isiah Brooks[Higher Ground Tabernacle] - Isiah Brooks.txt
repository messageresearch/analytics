prolong the time let us turn by the grace of God to Revelation 21 ah Thank You Jesus revelation is 21 beginning at the 22nd verse 22 23 we living in the last days you know that everybody's scared except the bride of Jesus Christ let's read their revelations 21 22 3 to 23 and I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the Sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light there our second Peter 1:11 second Peter 1:11 and then we'll go to Psalms 27 second Peter 1:11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we want you to really pay attentions to for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into that word into the everlasting Kingdom our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Psalm 27 we have such a we have a testimony but I guess after we finish the scripture will tell you by God's grace Psalm 27 beginning at the fourth verse one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple for in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret place secret of his Tabernacle shellye hide me he shall set me up upon a rock hallelujah let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for being better to us and we have been to ourselves we thank you for this evening Lord and in a day of great battle but you have given given us victory Lord we thank you for your amazing grace that your perfect will be done here tonight Lord we will give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated I don't know whether I didn't hear did you give you a testimony okay I'm sorry I didn't hear but I had my thing turned down anyway by the time I turned it up I assumed it was over but I just want to thank God for I was telling brother Troy and I think I told brother Keith the other day I was actually going into the trash and forgot my stairs were iced over and I did one of those banana peel slides I mean I literally went in the air and and I went down several stairs until I was at the bottom I J I definitely bruised my myself especially in the back there and and of course I jammed my arms and went to the chiropractor and he said I may have strained my rotor cups some I'm sore tonight but I'm grateful I didn't break any bones so I thank God for His grace and His mercy and you know I was telling my wife I said you know cuz she came out she heard the noise because I was carrying the trash I had one bag in the hand and of course the garbage can any other so when I slipped I went up like that the Lord protected me I didn't hit my head I totally it sound worse than the garbage man out there making noise but you know pride is something because it's telling examining myself to see whether I had broken into bones I was looking around to see if a neighbor was looking hey I got in the house I laughs of course it is okay it's alright to laugh cuz this it's it's amazing how we think about things like that in a time of crisis we we think about whether the neighbor is looking or now it ain't even their business but the truth of the matter is we we hate to be shameful but I mean you know every man is subject to fall fall is something that just happens unexpectedly and I haven't had one of those since I don't know years but anyway I thank the Lord because I coulda could have broken something or something or hit my head or you know there's always good and all of that but anyway I thank God I want to do a service tonight because I realized that we are with with all the kind of news that we have all of this is set forth to produce fear I was thinking about when Joshua was getting marching around Jericho and they didn't even open their mouths but you got to know that there were those who were inside of Jericho that literally produced fear because of what they had heard of Israel you know what they had done to Egypt 40 years had passed and the influence of what Jehovah God did in Egypt put such a fear in Jericho till they shut up the walls they closed up everything thinking that they were protected now just flip that the opposite way here was a people who got sent to conquer Jericho many of them were unlearned they remember they come from slaves and the children of slaves so they weren't educated the only thing they understood was that God was God and their only protection they needed was to stay behind the word and that word kept him and not only that the word gave them victory over a mighty city I'm gonna go with this if you look at Moses and here was Moses sent as a one-man army and you know Moses asked a question Who am I how can I go and conquer such a city as Egypt Egypt is well known they have conquered country after country they have slaves on top of slaves servants whatever you want to say they they they are the top of the line they are you know greater than Russia so but but here God is telling this person to go down and conquer and think about it what great Kingdom would be afraid of one man matter of fact you can almost hear the laughter of Pharaoh when Moses said unto him let my people go and Moses basically tells him that it's not in your hands as in the god I serve his hands and he's going to destroy you but watch this as God began to work the supernatural around and in Moses ministry how did this great city became fearful they had seen all of the plagues and everything and then they basically moved toward Pharaoh says all of his advisers says Ferro let him go let him go but one time in that time period Moses was the laughingstock because he escaped Egypt as a fugitive as a murderer yet until God took this murderer and made him the ruler the fact God told Moses he said I'm I'm gonna make you God unto Egypt it wasn't the flesh of Moses that became God it was God in the flesh and we find out that everything God told Moses would take place it happened but I'm trying to say something here God did not make it easy and when God tells you something to do don't expect it to slide like I did into position or into place you're gonna have to fight for it when God commissioned you to do anything all you need to do is be certain of God and when you're certain of God you move with it no matter what our adversities coming your way you are certain that God has sent you and God has told you what to do based upon that kind of assurance you become more than a conqueror the one thing that we desire is David said I don't know about you but I've come too far to even think about missing a rapture and I want to say something to all of us because perhaps we're not where we say we desire to be but remember don't forget the headstone he comes down crying grace grace not just one portion of grace what we need to do and I want to remind you and all of the good works that you'll do won't measure up to nothing because you cannot save yourself it is a blood of Jesus the grace of God that saves you we do not work to be saved we work for Christ amen to show him how we appreciate what he's did done on Calvary hallelujah it isn't is it a fact it is a known fact that no man could have withstood the Romans judgment of crucifixion like Christ did I couldn't have done it you couldn't have done it matter of fact we're so fragile a few licks harsh leaks or they're like me we would faint and think about it a beating all night premiere perhaps so much so they whipped him they beat him a mental history said he was unrecognizable think about it that's why at the resurrection Mary and the rest of them couldn't picture him as a regular human being they saw him and then they didn't see him because they didn't have pictures to remind them of what he looked like right so even when they saw him they couldn't recognize him because he was in his glorified but think about what he looked like that's what's the greatest miracle ever when they said listen we have seen him he has appeared unto us think about and in the minds of these disciples all these saw was a bloody mess a mutilated body a body that had been ripped by horse tails whips with with metal pieces in it but the devil didn't know that all of this was necessary Jesus didn't come to save himself remember that's what they said at Calvary he can save others but he can't save himself thank God he didn't he was on a mission and he knew amen that you and I in our day was going to need a hiding place Psalms 27 and 9 says hi not that face from me Oh Lord you know we thought amen every time I read that I'm like who had seen the face of God no man have seen him the Bible says except the son he's declared him for God is a spirit hello and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth you can't even see the face of God without God quickening it to you you said what do you mean here was God wrapped in human flesh we call him Jesus Pharisees called him he is above hallelujah I mean they had all kinds of name they even called him you know they say you were born of fornication a child of fornication but then there was a prostitute they called him Lord you understand me see she was able to see the face of God because she said we know when the Messiah come he's going to tell us these things and she recognized here she was standing there with the Messiah who was God in manifested in the flesh she knew that and she said come see a man who she is not given but but this lady needed a hiding place she needed somewhere that she could go and be accepted you know Jesus never go clean up all she had to do was recognize who he was and she knew the process would begin she wants you to recognize the Word of God nobody has to tell you to clean up the process begin at the birth hallelujah hide me Lord don't don't hide your face from me but not that serving away in anger thou has been my health leave me not leave me not neither forsake me O God of my salvation because see if God turned his back on you nobody can stand for you think about it we need a hiding place and you know by the grace of God we're getting ready to experience things on this earth that have never been experienced before is that right the Bible says it meant that this time when God strikes the earth in judgment it would be a time like never before that's the word what Noah went through will be nothing compared to what this generation is going to go through hallelujah and you and I know it at least Nora had a boat he had a knock he had a ship he asked something that he could hide himself right and you and I know that that Ark was a type of Christ I'm not gonna be long tonight but that Ark was a type of Christ amen and there was only one way in and one way out and that's how it is with Christ today there's only one way in hallelujah and when you get in you don't want to go out hallelujah songs of Sodom the second chapter says o my dove that art in the clubs of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see that countenance and I think about the secret place of the stairs we didn't know it but you like I told somebody I said prayer is the key to climbing the stairs you cannot cry understand is that right Jacob had prayed all night fell asleep and then what happened a ladder was shown to him and that ladder a man was going up and ages were ascending and descending that right so is it people of God Amen you came from God and you go back to God you have been sended but you bless us in as well hallelujah here was Jacob seeing a preview of the seven Church ages where angels were of course o to come down and go back you say they weren't there yes they were because the Bible said there were seven stars in the right hand of him hallelujah and those stars were there and it started hallelujah when God brought him down more are you Paul in the rest room all the way up to William Branham with several stars in the right hand of him hallelujah they had to dicen is that right Jesus was always but Jesus had to come down in order to go up hallelujah so did you hallelujah if you're a true seed of God you were there when God has Joe where were you when the sons of God saw me when they shouted for joy where were you you were there hallelujah but you had to come down into this RAM to be tested that's how come you know this message is right it's not him - will it know he that run it but God who shows mercy hallelujah these old brother Brooks what are you saying listen we're here for a cleansing process because of the fall we must go through justification we must go through the process of sanctification we must go through the process of fire baptism is that right nor was justification is that right the blood of Jesus Christ was Saint vacation and then comes down and he baptizes the earth in in fire we're almost ready for the fire to fall hallelujah but just as God redeems the well he redeems you and I why because we're part of the earth when God created the earth you were there you were in chemical song for you man hallelujah and so when that blood dropped on that earth when Jesus was crucified is sanctified the whole earth so that you can be sanctified hallelujah Oh glory to God listen and we hear to be cleansed so that God can didn't take the fire like he did Isaiah is that right now they're actually seeing the king of our die and he says Oh Lord it was sanctified me I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among the people of unclean lips anybody know what I'm talking about sometimes you even say things you shouldn't say he meant but we got a call we got a fire that will burn all of that out of you first of all you gotta acknowledge who you are using Lord I'm that kind of a sanctified me take a cold off of the altar law place it on my power hallelujah transform me cuz I can't do it my whole self hallelujah that's what the scripture was saying let me see that countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet as thy voice and that countenance is calmly hallelujah take us take us excuse me the fastest the little foxes that spoil the vine for our vines have tender grapes is that right you and I no email it's those little sins that spoil us it's those little foxes that get into our lives and defile us hallelujah but we want we want to see the countenance of God listen you gotta say the Lord you take them up take up the foxes remove the foxes Lord remove them take them out a vineyard that my grace will be perfect hallelujah all glory to God my beloved is mine and I am here whoa I love that cuz that's the way I feel the Lord Jesus is mine and I am here I love this he said feed me O Lord he feeds me among the lilies you know what the lilies is the lilies you know it gives you the opium hallelujah when it's crushed it gives you a high keep me there Lord keep my mind elevated let this mind be in me that was also in you let my mind amen be is your mind hallelujah elevated into high places feed me with the lilies of this message annoyed me stimulate me hallelujah that my mind I'm truly hallelujah realizing I'm in heavenly places y'all know what I'm saying you ever seen a person as high off drugs they don't know where they are hallelujah and they could even care less come on somebody that's the way it goes hallelujah until the daybreak I love that keep me keep me keep me high keep me keep me higher hard keep me don't let me come down I don't want to crash hallelujah keep me high until the daybreak when the daybreak what is that that is the rapture that is the coming of the Lord keep my mind in that place in the shadows flee away no more shadows we're like the pyramid now wherever the Sun strike us there is no shadow there is no darkness hallelujah there is no death you understand me shout a fee away turn my beloved impede are like a row or young heart the mountains of bether thank God good to us the hiding place there's only one hallelujah Noah escaped hallelujah y'all know that and then God did another hiding place when he there was a second Exodus which was actually in Egypt and that Exodus that in order to escape the Death Angel you had to hide not from Pharaoh not from the Egyptians you had to hide from another order death is the order of life if you want to put it that way it is a provided life but until you realize the born again order is higher you understand me we are higher than that order you understand me that's what Paul said Oh death where is your sting o grave where is your victory thanks be to God who gives us what the liberty freedom hallelujah that's what Paul laughed at him Paul laughed and says listen you are law order you are devil you are Satan you used to be in a high order but even in that order you could never be as great as I am well because even then use a servant and I am a son hallelujah you and I are sons and daughters of God we must treat him like that you know how not to be afraid anything that Satan loses hallelujah we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus but we must understand how so this is the final call see because you got to realize that even in Egypt those who were not under the blood died those firstborn right when I see the blood I'll pass over you now understand now these people had already been circumcised hmm and circumcision was a sad and the type of the Holy Spirit potentially they could go all the way with God but they failed because when God was trying to clean them up I think that's Deuteronomy God said I put you in the wilderness to try you so that you can see what was in your heart now God don't mind you seeing what's in your heart but once you see the field once you see the dirt once you see the darkness you're supposed to repent and ask God for forgiveness God wants us to repent he wants us to that's the only way he can start in on you there's no change can come about in your life until you repent from whatever it is hmm and they thought oh I had it made I mean I'm following the message of a prophet but reality they were not they just thought they were when they began to murmur and complain that showed that they were not under the inspiration of Moses they were under another influence somebody helped me here see when you began to see the word and you began to murmur and complain that that is another spirit it is the kind of spirit that God does not like because you do not appreciate his Liberty excuse me his leadership that's what I meant to say God is the leader and I don't know about you but I need a guy I need a guy hallelujah hey listen like I said amen and so what happened the death danger that didn't get them under the blood of the lamb got them in sanctification done death struck them while they were in the wilderness because they fail to allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify them who somebody help me here see because it's not good enough to come up to sanctification you got to go all the way that's why the bible says joshua and caleb had a different spirit somewhere somehow they got the same spirit then moses had y'all think I'm crazy I'll show you when Elijah was about ready to be translated Welsh's I just wish I had seen them chairs of fire and all that coming down like that oh my and Elijah saw he says Lord Lord Lord Lord I only ask one thing of you I want a double portion of your spirit do you know what that means because remember he lied you tried to put his coat on Elijah and he wasn't old enough he wasn't big enough he wasn't mature enough that's what has happened to a lot of people in the message they've tried to put only lies just he lies his cult which is the Holy Ghost but they're not mature enough so it doesn't fit but at the time that Elijah was to be translated somebody help me here see what we don't understand there is coming and anointing that he is coming an outpouring there he is coming at one time like experience of God that will bring us all to maturity those who are elected and chosen of God you can't cross the Jordan until that coat fits hallelujah and that coat wasn't just only outside it was only inside of the heart he caught a revelation and when he walked to the Jordan he said what open up--not where is the god of Elijah right see because he understood that Elijah wasn't the God there was a God higher than Elijah where is the god of Elijah that's the one who can open up this Jordan for me and the Bible said he he had struck it and walked out on it what was it the same size the same wonders the same power the same ministry that Elijah had Eli should now have it because he's come to maturity hallelujah the final call the final call hallelujah you know there was a final call even with Noah says you know come on in the ark many people have had heard it you know I mean you know Noah had a mega church he had to and perhaps Noah thought that all that was going to feel that aquas people he didn't know that God will never leave his table undone there gonna be somebody gonna fit the table and God called the animals amen and all these people watching seem like they should have known that Noah could not have moved the animals the way they were moving the only thing I could think of is maybe that God allowed them to calm into the ark at a nighttime when they couldn't see because you got to realize it was an age of blindness hello they were blind to the message they were blind to the messenger they were blind to the ark as big as it was that says only eight Souls but understand when the final call came Noah had nothing to do with it him God shut the door and when God shut the door no man can open it think about it I don't even know whether this rock was soundproof or not but all the screens in the Harling in the yelling Amen that that that that wood went on after the door was shut in the rain began to fall let me say it like this people of God it doesn't matter what the world is looking like you must know this is the final call this is that there's not coming another caroling of God's coming Elijah has come and gone and what we're now waiting on is the judgement and look what's happening now germ warfare ooh you said what do you mean why did the Prophet God preached a message that third Exodus because at the time of the third accident there were pledged hitting everywhere but the greatest of all the plagues was the Death Angel earthquakes in divers places tsunamis men dying locusts everywhere floods everywhere every continent shaking in rotten rocking hallelujah you know what I used to read revelation and the Bible said they wouldn't repent and now I realized I'm living in that day they will not repent just like in the days of Noah just like a days of heat up in Moses they would not repent even though they saw the hand with high handwriting on the wall Luke 17 22 through 24 don't mean the screaming holla but that's just the way he's got me and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for sorry if I say unto you that none of these men which were bidden shall taste of my supper and denominations that were bidden oh you said what brother was why you say it like that because remember the prophet of God says listen look at all robbers look at Tommy Hicks look at the way the people dress oh they all fancy and fine and everything else he said but look at my crew what was he saying I'm the ministry I'm the one that God sent to the hedges and highways I'm the one that God said to the poor and the needy that the crippled of blamed the main this ministry amen was the one who opened the eyes of the blind hallelujah who raised the dead come on somebody it wasn't the man but was Christ and then sovereign going among the hedges in the highways prostitution everybody else was being saved and everybody scarf daddy because they didn't understand the Scriptures were for being fulfilled in their day and you and I are part of it none of us know great thing hallelujah but we must be careful Paul said I got to be careful this i myself become a castaway don't you ever think that you got it all in the bag hallelujah y'all understand when you see what you mean oh I got it made listen just thinking like that puts you in a bad position mmm say by the grace of God see you got to understand there is a cost there is a cost and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hating out his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yay even his old life also he cannot be my disciple what is God to my hatred like that no he's basically saying you gotta love me more than you love your family you've got to love me more than you love yourself when it comes to family in the word the word must come first and God is gonna test every bit of it you're going to be tried in those areas because otherwise he would not have had it written hallelujah if you're going to be my disciple ha ha you must hate his father mother wife children brother sister what does he work with dogs who are so close to you those who can influence you from the word oh I love this because even locked was it was determined not to let his wife influence him I'm getting up out of here you know I just believe he was a gentleman amen when they began to escape he let his wife go in front right they angel there his wife in between and he's at the end right and his daughters you understand me so when she turned around hallelujah he saw what happened you understand me and he had to pass won't die you understand me you know a lot of times we thought oh she was behind him and he turned no no no it doesn't work like that it had to be she was in front and he had the bad pass her following the angel why because you got to understand miss lot had a real pool on his wife on his heart on her husband miss God had a whole lot pool hallelujah and God didn't even like her don't you say that he called a Lot's wife she never had a name Jezebel was so bad at least he gave her a name but y'all understand me and even in the New Testament he says remember Lot's wife right he felt the same way about Saul's daughter and give her name either call her saw daughter what that means her name was not in the book it is okay let's move on listen and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple you understand what that means that means you gotta suffer the cross is a symbol of suffering you gotta suffer in this way about what's wrong with me Oh Lord I don't understand where you go I'm going through all this stuff you gotta suffer don't you think that's okay the problem said the suffering of this world can not even be compared one moment in glory and you're gonna forget what you went through down here don't worry about it people he that begun a good work in you as faithful to completed that God don't want us to worry he want us to have faith I don't know how it's gonna happen but it gonna is gonna happen I believe I'm one of them you must believe that you're one of them and God is faithful God I'll never give up on you hallelujah don't you know that God can change your circumstances in a moment time oh you could be laying on the bed of affliction and gotta grant you what it takes to make a rapture on the bed of affliction God God is faithful him not like human being he's not he's long-suffering he's patient David said his mercy and good to all generation he never gives up on you why he can't you're part of the word you're part of him even so when he came to Moses being in that little Ark you think about it now you think about hearing Moses I'm jumping back and forth of Moses and then when MRAM and yo Sabet put Moses in that little Ark it was a little basket and had you know a Terp it was sealed with with turpentine and you know that stuff that that that alligators don't like and I was told that they still do that in Jordan when they cross and they got to have babies and baskets and pushing them along like that I guess when the waters are low I don't know but the point is God knew what to do right God knew what to do and Moses in that basket was the deliverer you understand me he was in the OP like no was in the arc no the deliverer Moses wasn't deliver up because the deliverer was in them jesus said I didn't come to condemn the world I came to give them life and that's why people look at Jesus like oh you know Jesus you know they look at this Bible as a hate book the only thing that God hated seeing hallelujah everything in here that they call hatred is not by God's grace God is a just God hallelujah and I'm gonna tell you something God will never take away your choice you are free moral agents you know where you said well why God do this and that because he knows before you choose what you're going to choose he's omniscient he's all he knows all things don't help me to explain it he's God you ask him all I know is that there are trillions of people in the world and he knows every thought every hair on your head every time you bat your eye you don't even know that and we think we can't put up with nothing and God listened to trillions of complaints every day huh we get a little something going on oh I can't take it God look at you that's why the Prophet God said God sometimes feel like kicking us around it's okay see listen I want you to understand because if you're in Christ this is why we try to tell people you're born again you're already you confess with your mouth you believe with your heart you're on your way but you're not matured yet you know some of us are not mature enough to put on the elijah coat the anointing that God has prepared for us you understand me but you see you're part of the ministry he can't do away with you because you're in the book you Elisha you understand what I'm saying but as Elisha matured that's what he did not even know that he was growing but you know when he was growing while he was with Elisha somebody help me here stay with the word stay with the message and you'll be growing into something that you don't even know you come to yet Oh romans eight one two three yeah you know it's the truth you know when you run a restaurant everybody ain't the manager some harm our waitresses some are waiters some are cooks some are you know Busboys but they part of the restaurant that's how it is with with God that's how it is with the church everybody ain't preachers some of us serve and some of us do this and some of us do that but we're still important this is important to make sure that the restaurant runs well are you sure the Busboys don't matter I know it does I used to be a busboy when I was in college and when the bus borden don't show up it puts a lot of pressure why he's the man that got to keep the dishes clean I was a good one too by God's grace hallelujah see buddy is so important because if he ain't there guess what the dishes more likely won't be clean you know I didn't just clean my dishes I made sure they were clean I just didn't throw my silverware in there and just take him out of the out of the rinse I took him out of the race and I took where they say is not lawful to do that now but I always back in the day you take a clean towel and make sure they shine but I think that's not sanitary anymore but anyhow I had a lot of German women work with me they were perfectionist so they liked the way I did it anyhow let's go on you love the Lord Romans eight one through three says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah they were the same presidents if you're sealed with the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost God equates that to walking after the spirit and when you're walking after the spirit there's no condemnation so while you condemning yourself all God says don't grieve the Holy Spirit he didn't say he condemned you he said just don't grieve I was thinking about this I said we were in Christ see that's why Christ had to make a hundred he had to prove that he was the world the Living Word he was a very life of the seed or the life of the seed in him was in him that's why John said if that seed being you you cannot sin you know what that word sin means it means that you can't disbelieve you there's no unbelief there is no way you can disbelieve how can God disbelieve his word he's the one he's talking about and because he's in you you cannot see and why because of the life of the blood keeps whatever sin whatever shortcoming you do away from reaching heaven we're dropped by here Oh Lord I ain't worthy that devil got you deceived because of you in Christ you're always worthy there alright says what for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death is that plain the law of the spirit of life but like Christ in you the hope of glory that long in you have actually saved you from the law of sin and death why because the law the sin and death have already been condemned hallelujah condemned we're in the flesh God knows this is your trouble but he justifies you he justifies you I'm trying to set you free cuz if you don't get free somewhere down the road you know this disease they call coronavirus gonna get you when I see the Blood I pass over you if you don't have is that you under the blood you better make sure you get that because if you have confidence on that you're under the blood that old devil Kate how are you that's not even the worst thing that's coming this is just the beginning of their warfare this is a job warfare and all you've got to do is get one person in their minds that China meant to do this then they're gonna release what they got you ever thought about it if they get in their mind that this was a purpose thing now depending on the fact that they're not all in collaboration together if these are separate entities at this point working what they're working cuz ya'll know that right china has a law one or two babies that I think the rest have to be aborted or whatever the case may be so they don't care about life godless country you understand what I'm saying why did they hold back so long when they saw this virus moving it ain't just propaganda people dying I'm not saying that the news people ain't blowing it up some but listen you got people so scared you know I had a brother not long ago so I'm not afraid and everywhere I went he hit the hit the Sanitation thing you know why you be afraid being food don't go to no restaurant that's why God said pray over it I know let no devil put me in prison if I decide to go somewhere I'm going no I did not cancer ain't meant Liberia because I'm afraid of the coronavirus I just wanted the perfect will of God whenever God said go I'll go I told her brother today I can't he said you scared no coronavirus what they got to do with me I'm protected I'm immune by the blood of the Lamb yes sir I'm immune and guess what that they the people that fear this thing if you fear it it's coming y'all don't believe that you walk by a dog and you get scared that dog is even a cat or jump-jump you if they know you're scared I know you shouldn't be afraid listen people I even hear citizen conversations I'm just gonna live my life I'm like that's right I'm just gonna live my life however got ain't nothing taking me prematurely fear it was a thing that you fear job says come upon you hmm Moses it don't worry Oh daddy daddy daddy are you sure you sure yes the blood has been applied the blood is on the doorpost in the little don't worry about it my child you're the firstborn but let me tell you that that angel will have to pass you by hallelujah you love the Lord oh my you think about the souls in prison because they failed to take heed to the last call they didn't even know it you know at least when you get on the train they holler last call well I don't know whether they still do that or not but back in the day you understood even went on the plane you get ready it's a last call this is a lot of time we're gonna close in so many minutes if you don't get here in that time the door is shut so in the natural you know that this in the spiritual that's coming a last call coming is that right you said a win-win-win I'm telling you in the Bible according the revelation says the spirit and the bride says come she is the last call hallelujah she is the one that God is using to try to get people into the ark of Christ mm-hmm oh you think about it he said when I saw him I fell at my feet are calling the revelations 11:1 I'm accusing one 17 through 18 says and when I saw him I fell at his feet that's dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death so when the devil say you're gonna die you laugh at him he don't even have the keys how can death kill you take you out here if he doesn't have the key oh come on somebody I almost send you to hell you don't even have the keys anymore somebody help me Jesus took the keys of death hell and the blade hallelujah and if he took the keys of death hell and the grave and I am in him hallelujah come on son we're in Christ he hauls the kids we hold the keys and they're screaming for mercy talking about in the days of Noah he had to shut the door cuz they had spewing mercy and they had to receive judgment and he goes down past the demons talking about Christ I'm sorry and I can see him down to in hell where the devil was she knocked at the door that never said who is there he said and open up and I can see the devil open up the door oh you finally arrived see Jesus was a surprise to hell he was a such a surprise that devil didn't understand that he wasn't coming down as a mortal man he he didn't go to hell as a failure he went to hell because he just conquered all the demons are building in earth he's going down to hell and he kept conquering all the major demons now and guess what he went to the king of demons who was Satan himself huh he didn't go to them to the demon of a psychotic he didn't go to the demon you know of cancer anything he went to the main demon oh my people don't you understand Satan is defeated and when Satan is defeated that means his whole kingdom is defeated he conquered death hell and the grave he went and he conquered Satan first he preached to the souls that were imprisoned and asked him why why didn't you believe in you know what it ought to be the same way many people who claim to be in the message will miss it because they fail to believe they spit on the mercy and grace of God hallelujah you know the doubt that devil is just like a rattlesnake you know what I'm saying he just rattled you know I could see him when Jesus was talking to him he's probably rattling his keys like a snake rattle trying to scare him you know I mean you can't scare God there's no fear in him oh oh that's why the Bible said perfect love casts out fear there is no fear if he's in there it is okay I'm almost done by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear and I like that move with fear that means move with reverence prepared not to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is in God I can see that great Holy Spirit standing above see I can see the angels of God sitting near with their swords drawn see so you gotta understand that no matter what as a believer no matter how hard it may seems our hard life may seem as long as you're in Christ Jesus there is nothing present nothing future can wreak and reach your soul separate us from the love of Christ in Christ Jesus nothing can separate you if your soul have been converted nothing can separate you the devil would turn every Gale inhale loose on you but God has got an atonement standing between you he's he'll float every wave you understand me in other words when the devil tried to come knocking on your hearts door he's got to get by Jesus first and he can't get back Jesus because he's in your heart Jesus is a strongman in your heart now one time Satan used to be the strongman now Jesus Christ is the strongman hallelujah he got to go beyond the blood he can't get beneath the blood he can't go on there no no no no no as long as the blood applying them ain't no use and being afraid of nothing the devil is a tormentor you know what the devil does he loved to repeat himself he does oh you can't pay this bill this is gonna happen five minutes later oh he's repeating himself he you know what that would drive a man crazy if you listen to the dripping of the faucet you came moving in a drip drip drip that will run you crazy and that's how Satan is he he come in come bringing you bad news all the time yeah bring you bad news all the time and you listen to that you will lose your mind set your sectional things about you gotta listen to God you gotta listen to the word listen that's why the Bible says think on these things whatever is pure whatsoever honest whatsoever is of good report think on these things you all you and I need to have the jaw mentality job mentality hallelujah the Lord giveth in the Lord taketh away the only thing that he ain't gonna take away from you as my soul hallelujah y'all so why because you've been redeemed he preserves your soul hallelujah he is so faithful I love God I love God I said to the Lord I said O God you know me and they know you should be trying to hide from you you know me this is what I love about God he knows me bruh he still loves us though He loves us and I love the love that God has for us it's not conditional is unconditional that's why Paul says who gonna separate you don't let your failures in this world think that that could separate you from God you were failures to be getting there we were born failures trust him this is the time to trust God this time of the year are always the devil always see you ain't gonna have your income tax money you ain't gonna be able to pay anybody know what I'm talking about he comes to me every year I told him this year I said you know what I'm determined I'm happy because no matter what you do you can't touch this if God suffered me to go through a trial show but I ain't worried about that because God said if I bought in his word and his word abide in me I can ask whatever I will I'm riding on it I'll ride I'm not only people every word of God that will give me victory I'm riding on it I don't care where it come from neither does God that old prostitute had a little bit of money just about alabaster pops he could care less what he got wish you got it from he was appointed she was appointed and anointed amen to anoint his feet hallelujah you saw what do you mean brother books I am appointed and I am anointed and so are you to be the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah if you have lost something in the in the process of your journey don't worry about it the Bible said I shall restore it whatever the problem the keiko on the logos in the caterpillar have eaten away I will restore poo the bride tree are you part of the bride tree I am and all of us have to go through these these transitions you know you get saved you get all happy you know your love everybody and here come the Pomeroy here come the cankerworm here come the cattle yeah each and every one of us go through that experience until we feel like all our praise have been eaten off then God says I shall restore you and I must go through all of the things that the seven churches went through we go through as individuals mmm well you even go through the period where you have to be careful not to fall under the Nicolaitans spirit of this message you have to identify what into Christ's spirit is versus the Spirit of the Holy Spirit as an individual you go through those sovereign battles that they went through you go through the persecution hallelujah you go through we're charge woman did not dominate you hallelujah but we don't let that happen we're pride we can tell the difference between the anointings you love the Lord I'm almost done hallelujah remember Jesus said you you'll be able to do the same just like just like Elijah had to grow up and mature to put on Elijah's coat so do we before we can put on the whole sometimes we try to put it on in just a little bit too big for us but as we can to mature victory after victory after victory because you know what as you mature childish things become nonsense it makes you know I'm tired of this stuff you get to a place you get tired that's a good place to be because when you become tired of that stuff then God can move you on hallelujah is that Alright they asked Jesus said to him listen you'll be able hear the same cup that I drink your drink the same baptism I'm baptized with you shall be baptized with he said the same the same Holy Ghost that field Jesus come to fill you the same not some other spirit something less the same the thing saying things like that I do you shall do also what did he do spoke in tongues cast out Devils preach the gospel heal the sick the same thing that he did we can do too and at the end of our days as he raised from the dead so will we who are in him don't you want the same it's not enough to talk about Elijah if the spirit of Elijah is not upon us you know when people say oh you used to tight you too strict well I got if I got the same one spirit that Elijah had I got the same anointing and the same attitude he had I don't have the same attitude he had I don't I got another spirit and you don't understand that this spirit came and when I talk about are things you know what I'm trying to say is that every one of us have different battles right now but you know in my senses I don't know whether it's going to happen this year next year but I feel like if this coronavirus thing keep going the stock market go to crash anyway and you worried about dollars and your dollars they go mean nothing y'all talking about roughing it that right the profit God said when that happened easy living for the Christian will be over I remember when they doing that I'm closer I remember we were doing that y2k I told him people I say y'all dead ain't working I said I really believe that if there was a y2k the prophet of God would have said something about it because there's too big of an event for it to pass by us and we not know it I had people in my church angry with me thank you it literally and one sister said well when it happened don't come by my house cuz I ain't giving you nothing Holy Ghost feel fire baptized don't sound like Jesus - oh is that right the funny thing about it it did not happen I went to South Africa that same year and they didn't know nothing about y2k that's when I really really really realized that there was American scam people made a lot of money people making a lot of money now masks you know sanitizers lots of money and what good is it going to do you and I know that the rich on the world come on somebody it's real has always been real and at the end of the day we are the ones that will scare them because when the Holy Ghost comes come on Oh y'all like y'all don't even know what I'm talking about you see the devil has always been afraid of Christians that's why he's always tried to get rid of them true sons and daughters of God for Moses Joseph you name him the devil has always tried to kill the true seed of God Jesus he wiped out Paul in the restaurant but what he did not understand is that the seeds had already been planted and there was going to come up another crop he didn't understand that and don't you understand we look at a Zuzu Street and everything else the Pentecost to era and we looked at that era and this is what gets me that was the shock and you trying to tell me that the shock had more visitation from God than the seed itself no sir no sir you understand me no sir here's a seat I'm now in everybody backing up not this one no bring on the challenge I told the Lord I said Lord I won't scars give me some scars he said brother Brooks a you know when I get over there I don't want to have no plain face and ain't got nothing to show I've been in a battle I want some battle scars not for doing evil myself I'm to my battle scars I can do it by his grace if he give me and equip me I can do it before I knew anything about this message I used to be on the street I was wandering them saying crazy people out there preaching on the corner playing my tambourine way back in winning souls to Christ that's when you could do it in wasn't against the law now you got to get a certificate all kind of stuff just to preach out there I wasn't ashamed by him then and I'm not ashamed of him now and people of God is getting close but I tell you what just like I said you're not gonna climb that stair without prayer I mean you can let the devil fool you you know I know we fall we come short all the time but I just like I try to tell somebody all you can do is get on your knees and say have mercy lord have mercy it'll be better than not getting on your knees at all spend some time with Jesus he said whatever you do in the closet here bring it out right Stan let's stand please the Bible tells us in the book of Revelation that Jesus Christ there is no temple but God is the - he's the temple the Bible says no light no sunshine is needed no moon is needed nothing is needed because the lamb is the light hallelujah you and I can't even imagine a world with no moon no Sun no nothing but the light of God guess what the Bible said that brighter Jesus Christ will have the glory of God we will illuminate the city like never before you've seen perhaps in movies they try to try to mimic God and have this light well you came from somewhere every perversion come from something that's not they always let the light of God and the angel stepping out of a light but did you not know that when the light of God comes in you it constantly moves out that cosmic light in you cosmic light is every seven years you lose it cause like and that's why you get old yes to get and all of that because you're losing the light that used to keep and now amen one of these old days we'll have a light in us that that will never move will always be there that same light of Jesus it's gonna transform this flesh change us from these old bodies to something young something beautiful something pure why because we heard the final call because we listen a bit to the call of our hour and guess what like Noah we moved with reverence but people have thought is gonna get rough it's gonna get harder you know the Bible declares it what we're gonna do the scripture says that we can run with the chariots I mean with the horsemen when they're with the footmen what's gonna happen when the chair is in the hospital when the greatest thing that's that's just giving scenario not closing supposing the stock market crash that means everything shuts down no water no spoon martial law comes in the car people gonna be fighting and killing each other over food and water but in at that time you're vulnerable you're bothering because you want to live if this is all you got you're gonna want to live today ain't gonna happen it happened in Germany because you got to understand before Hitler could conquer all in the other world Hitler had to conquer Germany first this country has to be conquered in order for the world World Order to move into his place and it just seemed like we're moving that way it may come and God might hit a pause brain but my point is don't take it lightly you need to ask God to help but I can't be desperate anybody know how to be desperate I don't I can't make myself guess I need God to help me this is a time of desperation and you know what we're doing the boss says run when your vision is made plain run he said ah [Music] anybody have ever have you ever had you know I'm joyous I don't mean I start left only because I'm left with me because I can see myself I've had a I've had dreams like that where something is chasing me and I'm trying to move fast and I'm going in slow motion trying to get out of his way that's a bad position to be in but

our individuals and we work in a different way we worship in a different way and when he comes up like this sometimes all I can do is laugh you know unless you want me to explode in you but that's the way it works you love the Lord one day I hear him laugh you know that cuz he said he's gonna laugh at the sinner did you know that come brother you love the Lord appreciate the pool amen thank you
