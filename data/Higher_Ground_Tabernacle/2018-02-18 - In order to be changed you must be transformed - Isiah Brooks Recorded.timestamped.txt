[0:00] except you put the blood on the
[0:02] doorposts in a little you should surely
[0:05] die you can say oh well I've been born
[0:08] uh uh
[0:10] Israelite I'm a Jew I'm from the stock
[0:13] of so-and-so God didn't care about that
[0:15] the voice said put the blood on the
[0:19] doorpost and the little whether you Jew
[0:22] or Egyptian if the blood is not found on
[0:25] the doorpost in a little the death
[0:27] dangers gonna get you hallelujah
[0:31] what would the voice what was the voice
[0:33] of Mercy the voice of Mercy was Jesus
[0:36] when he came to this day they had the
[0:39] Sadducees the Pharisees and Herodians
[0:41] they had all religious people and there
[0:44] were people who in appearance could
[0:46] outshine the believer hallelujah
[0:51] but jesus said except believe that I am
[0:54] he you shall likewise die in your sin it
[0:58] wasn't about your religion it wasn't
[1:00] whether you grandpa
[1:01] your grandmama or whatever was a leave
[1:04] iron of the Levitical priesthood of the
[1:06] family of Aaron it was you had to
[1:09] believe that Jesus was that angel of
[1:12] mercy is that right
[1:15] come on Simon honey you and I must
[1:18] understand when when it comes to mercy
[1:20] God has one door he always had one door
[1:24] right on the ark there was one door is
[1:28] that right in Egypt there was one door
[1:30] and Moses was that door hallelujah amen
[1:34] so you and I must realize there's only
[1:36] one goal in our day except you eat the
[1:41] book hallelujah
[1:44] except this mess has become your life
[1:46] there is no mercy now for those who plan
[1:52] to make a rapture you understand me
[1:56] we are living in such a time we ought to
[1:59] be expecting Jesus Christ at any time is
[2:05] what brother books I don't understand
[2:07] remember God said mercy to the churches
[2:09] seven churches and and later see it was
[2:12] the only one that had him Jesus cry
[2:14] only outside of his own church knocking
[2:16] trying to get in ah
[2:18] because it was a age where the woman
[2:21] ruled she ruled the world she ruled
[2:25] everything and now they're doing the
[2:26] same thing she rules the churches and
[2:30] where is Jesus on the outside trying to
[2:34] get in but realizing men what they did
[2:37] not understand is that Jesus did not
[2:40] come and then with nail pierced ears and
[2:43] you know bruises on his head or nail
[2:45] scar feet he came in a little Kentucky
[2:48] Oh y'all getting nervous when I say that
[2:52] I'm not saying that brother Brandon was
[2:54] God but he was a vessel that God used
[2:57] like he used Moses like he used Noah
[3:01] hallelujah he was hidden behind that
[3:04] veil he was that mercy that angel mercy
[3:12] hallelujah it's the truth who was the
[3:17] age of mercy to nineveh jonah jonah was
[3:24] not an ordinary man but he was a prophet
[3:26] God said them to Nineveh and Nineveh did
[3:29] what they did ever do they said God did
[3:32] it God placed him in a belly of a whale
[3:37] because he no knew that Nineveh worship
[3:41] the fish God see God will go all out of
[3:45] his way for you there'll be nobody at
[3:48] that day of judgment that will have an
[3:50] excuse when God says why not there will
[3:55] be no one who could say God you didn't
[3:57] do this and you didn't do that because
[4:00] God goes out of his way to get the
[4:03] people's a teacher hallelujah even
[4:09] before Scylla dies God reveals himself
[4:13] some way or another to inform him then
[4:17] they let them know that their days are
[4:19] limited but you know what they do they
[4:22] just push over it like it's nothing
[4:25] y'all hear me
[4:27] we ought to be in expectation remember
[4:34] Amen we are the bride who live you know
[4:38] we're not expected to be this are
[4:40] flamboyant our church this this church
[4:43] that that as they say looks fabulous
[4:47] no we're humble people we come amen from
[4:54] let's separate this way a race of
[4:57] shepherds meek and lowly and humble
[5:03] hallelujah but we're not those event
[5:06] that got a got a look or act in such a
[5:09] way that we draw attention to ourselves
[5:14] my fact most of the people that really
[5:16] will make a rapture won't have heart and
[5:18] nothing cuz they don't have nothing to
[5:21] lose now I'm gonna tell you like this
[5:25] God can make you a billionaire and he
[5:28] would do it if he knew you would him
[5:32] first
[5:34] God don't mind you making money
[5:36] God don't mind you even can be as rich
[5:38] as you want to be it's wrong you put
[5:41] Jesus first that's all God asked you
[5:44] don't worship the manner the Mammon but
[5:49] worship the God who gave gives it to you
[5:51] see I don't want anybody to think that
[5:54] I'm promoting uh or not ignorance or or
[5:58] anything like that or not having nice
[6:00] stages alright to have nice things
[6:02] don't let those nice things become your
[6:05] hindrance you say oh they won't be yeah
[6:08] they can be that guess why because
[6:12] that's what happened to Lot's wife she
[6:16] loved those worldly things more than she
[6:18] loved God we ought to be an expectation
[6:22] like that song I'm packing up the gate
[6:25] get ready to go the Prophet I said I'm
[6:27] not packing up I'm unpacking I'm not
[6:33] packing listen anybody knows of anyone
[6:38] who took a
[6:39] Cadillac with them when they die I don't
[6:42] care if they would bear it in it it
[6:44] didn't go with their hallelujah and you
[6:49] know I must realize this night or this
[6:51] morning a member it the most important
[6:54] thing that you need to have is your
[6:57] character one thing about the bride you
[7:01] don't have to make her worship you don't
[7:05] have to pump her up you don't have to
[7:08] beg her to give praise somebody give a
[7:11] praise no you don't have the bigger
[7:12] she's always ready she's always she's
[7:17] not just got a little bit of oil but she
[7:20] got all in the next royal hallelujah
[7:23] she's always there think about it that
[7:28] little girl who the rancher son I'm
[7:30] coming just a minute that little wretch
[7:32] of certain ranches a son went looking
[7:35] for a wife and and you know he y'all we
[7:38] all know the story found this little
[7:39] girl and what she was in the backyard
[7:41] she was a cousin to those who were the
[7:43] real fancy ones in our life and and she
[7:45] wasn't doing nothing but doing the
[7:46] dishes and things like that but it
[7:50] wasn't her outward appearance that
[7:52] caught his attention
[7:53] hallelujah you know that was one of the
[7:57] things I even went as a boy I thought
[7:59] because we had this Catholic Church
[8:01] around and you see those nuns they
[8:03] always looked so holy not anymore you
[8:05] know they don't hike their dresses up to
[8:10] somebody should have said Amen on and I
[8:14] did not even know that what they do they
[8:16] wear that veil but underneath the veil
[8:19] that got short hair where they cut it I
[8:22] was so shocked because what's the user
[8:29] having a rag over your hair and you cut
[8:31] me cut you hair you spill ball to god oh
[8:36] lord help me somebody
[8:39] what is it we don't love him like we
[8:42] used to
[8:43] that's the whole problem he he loves us
[8:46] he'll never stop loving us but we don't
[8:49] love him not the way we used to
[8:52] hmm when we love God God was the sin of
[8:56] attraction nothing could distract us we
[9:00] were God all the time we were so God
[9:03] minded that even our our family would
[9:06] call us fanatics when the last you've
[9:09] been called a fanatic and you and I must
[9:14] realize by God's grace that this is
[9:16] trimming time but trim off all of the
[9:21] world all the things that's not belong
[9:23] to God supposed to be trimmed off oh my
[9:27] it's the truth
[9:28] the like listen how many you can say
[9:30] well I'm shining the light Hill closing
[9:33] shining the light hears no character
[9:37] builds a time
[9:39] II meant that the saints of God was so
[9:41] holy their faces were illuminated would
[9:44] lie where is it like now y'all hear me
[9:52] what about that church the Bible says
[9:56] the gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[9:59] it
[10:00] we are that church but because we're not
[10:04] built upon stones and bricks we're not
[10:07] built upon some modern things like that
[10:09] but I revelation is to built upon who
[10:13] Jesus Christ is hello now I don't want
[10:21] you some of y'all looking at so tired
[10:23] y'all came how to make it but y'all get
[10:25] out there and you're talking yack yack
[10:27] yeah I could be refreshed once you get
[10:28] outside shame on you
[10:31] give God your energy here if you want to
[10:34] get sleepy
[10:34] get sleepy out the church give God your
[10:40] energy we look at these things and we
[10:43] said all brother Brooks and gates of
[10:45] Hell sitting over there mom because we
[10:47] are those Amen who are filled with the
[10:51] Holy Ghost will not have fallen will not
[10:55] have empty will feel those of us who are
[11:00] filled
[11:05] think about how those men when they were
[11:07] fighting how many mouths they thought
[11:09] they meant through those Philistines to
[11:10] give to just to give a drink of water to
[11:14] today they thought for miles
[11:21] hallelujah they brought back the water
[11:24] to David
[11:25] david says I'm so unworthy I can't drink
[11:28] this water and he poured it out on the
[11:30] ground giving God a drink offering well
[11:33] what was your attitude of been what
[11:36] would you add you mean to tell me I
[11:38] risked my life to give you some water
[11:40] and you pulled it out but David realized
[11:45] that God protect the dose with me that
[11:48] water did not cut they came by the hands
[11:50] of the men but God that water
[11:55] what's happening people I want you to
[11:58] look around at yourself now my point is
[12:03] some of us we can't make it to church
[12:05] but on Sundays but then when we come to
[12:08] church on Sundays what do we do do we
[12:10] really appreciate God because your
[12:13] action will show you know are you really
[12:20] thirsty are you really hungry do you
[12:21] really want God's anointing you can't
[12:26] get God anointed without pulling you can
[12:29] put a fish on the hook line amen and if
[12:32] you don't pull that fish in it's not
[12:33] coming even the woman at the well knew
[12:38] she had to do something and get that
[12:40] water from the bottom to the top and
[12:44] here God says I give you a well of water
[12:47] springing up out of eternal life Halle
[12:51] knew that means you don't have to work
[12:53] for this go come on up where is that
[12:55] well where is that water in us where is
[12:59] it the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[13:08] little bit
[13:09] rock I'll build my church and the gates
[13:11] of Hell cannot prevail against it time
[13:14] you may come and go things may change
[13:16] but the gospel of Jesus Christ remains
[13:19] the same through all ceaseless ages upon
[13:23] this rock I'll build my church
[13:25] what was the church what was the rock
[13:29] what is your revelation of that
[13:32] what is our revelation of that all on
[13:36] Christ I saw that's what it is Christ is
[13:40] who Jesus is rock I stand all of the
[13:46] ground is sinking sand all other ground
[13:49] is sinking saying yes I'm trying to get
[13:57] you to think because God said we'll be
[14:00] on fire where is the fire where is the
[14:08] fire where is your fire everybody where
[14:14] is your fire my point is Amen we need
[14:18] more than this well I'm predestinated
[14:23] understand if your predestinated
[14:25] something supposed to be going on in
[14:28] your life God is moving and he's
[14:31] building character God is pushing in and
[14:34] leading us amen to into the statue of a
[14:37] perfect man hallelujah is that right
[14:40] weren't you supposed to be there that's
[14:43] power that's praying knowledge low
[14:47] suffering all these things supposed to
[14:48] be radiant in us hey come on somebody
[14:53] when this light is turned off it don't
[14:56] be a light it will never express itself
[14:59] until the powers turned on and that's
[15:03] what God is expecting for us I'm not
[15:05] saying you're not a light but where is
[15:07] that light that illumination that can
[15:10] make me see that there is God in you let
[15:18] the truth
[15:19] Bob said they called them Christians at
[15:21] Antioch Wow they walked like Christ they
[15:23] talk like Christ they look like Christ
[15:25] healings was like Christ everything was
[15:27] like Christ so they didn't have to call
[15:29] themselves Christians
[15:30] somebody else did is that right
[15:38] coming to church don't make you a
[15:40] Christian though right you and I must
[15:43] understand there must be an intimate
[15:45] relationship between you and God
[15:47] now it sounds like I'm fussing I'm not
[15:51] I'm trying to encourage you my voice may
[15:53] sound like I'm screaming I am I'm a
[15:56] eagle
[15:56] my point is but I'm trying to say it's
[15:59] urgent it's urgent don't get slack now
[16:04] you're too close to the finishing line
[16:06] right hallelujah
[16:09] you can't get slack now your goal is in
[16:13] reach yes you're tired but you take that
[16:16] runner you take that runner he's been
[16:19] running a long time and now he's he's
[16:21] almost and you got that crowd says come
[16:24] on you can make it you can make it give
[16:26] it give it all you got I love hearing
[16:29] that give it all you got
[16:31] somehow that helps you cause down
[16:34] somewhere there there's some reserves
[16:38] you think you can't move it you think
[16:40] you can't run any faster but there's
[16:42] some reserves that your mind goes down
[16:44] and get and all of a sudden you picking
[16:46] up those steps and you find yourself
[16:48] breaking the line that's where we are
[16:52] we're so close bombs find everywhere all
[16:56] nations it is almost every little small
[16:58] nation now can can can can shooter armed
[17:02] atomic bomb at us it ain't just America

[17:10] whatever we sold we're going to reap it
[17:13] and what did what did America so the
[17:17] atomic bomb hallelujah what do we do not
[17:22] long ago in Afghanistan we dropped all
[17:25] kinds of bombs and wiped out people
[17:27] that's why you don't hear much about
[17:28] them anymore our country is no longer
[17:32] speaking
[17:33] like a lamb she's a dragon and if she's
[17:37] turned her change her nature into that
[17:39] how far are we from seeing the Pope
[17:42] raise up how far we a men from seeing a
[17:47] man these organizational churches stop
[17:49] us from preaching it's coming people
[17:55] brother Branham said I can hear the
[17:58] combine what is a combine is that
[18:00] machinery that gather in the wheat and
[18:03] throughout the shock you and I must
[18:07] realize hey man there's a pressure
[18:08] coming and if you don't take inventory
[18:11] right now just like those foolish
[18:14] virgins you're gonna find out you don't
[18:16] have enough oil and that oil Amen is the
[18:21] thing that keeps your lighter burning
[18:23] who is this okay oh my when God said
[18:29] jesus said unto Simon bar Jonah blessed
[18:32] are you simon barjona because flesh and
[18:34] blood has not revealed this to you we
[18:36] must not understand the greatest
[18:39] revelation that we have received in this
[18:41] day is the revelation of who Jesus is
[18:44] [Music]
[18:47] why because when you get that revelation
[18:50] down in your soul you realize Amen that
[18:53] you are not part of a denomination
[18:55] you're not part of an organization I'm
[18:58] not a part of a what you call a message
[19:00] called
[19:01] I'm not part of any of that my body
[19:05] belongs to God I don't care about what
[19:09] other message churches do I am no gain
[19:12] to make sure this one see Jesus I'm not
[19:18] an organization they can do what they
[19:19] want to do where y'all servicing like
[19:22] this ain't got to be that way
[19:24] did y'all understand that as they ain't
[19:29] got to be that way and that's just what
[19:32] I meant you and I must understand Amen
[19:35] by the grace of God that the Holy Spirit
[19:37] is supposed to be moving this church huh
[19:42] the Holy Ghost
[19:44] supposed to be moving this church Oh
[19:49] sisters let me tell you something even
[19:51] in a New Testament church they had
[19:53] prophetess huh
[19:57] they had spiritual women they weren't
[20:01] all about always about the kitchen
[20:03] they had spiritual women that love God
[20:06] so don't feel like oh I'm out of it no
[20:09] you're not what if God wants to use you
[20:14] well they don't do it like that over
[20:16] there the other other church I don't
[20:18] care about that we are interested in
[20:20] seeing the body of God move I'm not
[20:25] calling you a preacher I'm saying there
[20:27] are gifts that need to be displayed but
[20:32] until we get spiritual garden gonna use
[20:35] it male or female you understand me
[20:40] this must be a spiritual church a Holy
[20:45] Ghost Church if it's not the Holy Ghost
[20:47] Church is not a church at all that's why
[20:52] I preach about it a lot because I know
[20:55] that if we saw into the form of a
[20:58] religion we're dead
[21:00] but as long as we can get the water of
[21:03] God flowing through us as long as the
[21:06] Holy Ghost is still moving hallelujah it
[21:08] doesn't mean we got a shower run up and
[21:10] down the aisle but my point is there
[21:13] should be enough Holy Ghost in this
[21:16] place that I could feel it from here
[21:18] today I come to be different I am
[21:29] different
[21:31] you ought to see yourself different
[21:33] that's why I don't like all that
[21:35] Facebook and face chat and face all that
[21:37] tweet and Twitter listen cuz you get all
[21:40] the garbage of the message you get all
[21:44] the junk and that stuff get in you and
[21:46] you can't even get out you come to
[21:48] church and you wonder why can't I praise
[21:49] God now I didn't say that he said it cuz
[21:53] I don't even have that in my note and it
[21:55] wasn't even in my mind
[21:58] these things are distracting you and you
[22:01] don't even know it
[22:04] listen what the proper God says oh
[22:06] praise be to God
[22:07] I like his spirit God yes it's
[22:13] appropriate for a minister to worship
[22:15] God from the pulpit with Thanksgiving
[22:17] and praise and on and light oh how real
[22:20] how it just thrills my soul that I feel
[22:23] like I could could scream and run and
[22:26] jump as high as I could jump because
[22:29] there is something within me that
[22:32] changed me from what I was I'm not what
[22:36] I ought to be I'm not what I want to be
[22:39] but I know I've been changed from what I
[22:41] used to be see something has happened
[22:44] something taken place you and I must
[22:49] understand Amen that Enoch walked with
[22:51] God he's your brother Brooks how can I
[22:54] walk with God let's put it this way when
[23:00] Adam and Eve sinned the Bible said the
[23:04] voice of God walked in the cool of the
[23:08] evening Adam we're out now that voice of
[23:19] God as we know was Jesus Christ himself
[23:22] it was God there's only one voice
[23:28] seven-fourths 2007 church ages but there
[23:30] was one blast seven voices but it was
[23:34] only one voice and you know I realized
[23:39] by God's grace that when God talks to us
[23:42] I hope he does all of us is that small
[23:49] still voice and when that voice talks to
[23:54] us you and I we supposed to be able to
[23:57] know that that's his voice not say oh is
[24:00] that you Lord no you supposed to know
[24:03] when God talks to you you heard him and
[24:07] you're supposed to be obedient to it
[24:09] that's how you
[24:10] with God hallelujah you show up presents
[24:14] Adam here advice let me taste them you
[24:16] won't even know his voice until you know
[24:18] the things he would say when the prophet
[24:24] of God came he came not with his own
[24:26] voice he came with God's voice when I
[24:30] hear brother branham it's not that I'm
[24:31] listening to the tones and everything of
[24:34] his voice that's God a voice in a voice
[24:37] you understand me it's like prophecy
[24:40] it's like any preacher it's not my voice
[24:42] you listening to its divorce in the
[24:44] voice that's right sister and you now
[24:47] ought to be able to hear it you don't
[24:49] hear it you don't hear God you got to be
[24:54] able to hear God well I don't believe
[24:57] that your attitude is reflected in
[25:00] heaven I don't have to judge that but my
[25:03] point is when you come to this church
[25:05] and you don't hear what God is saying
[25:08] why do you come you come to hear me I'm
[25:13] flesh and blood I make mistakes all the
[25:16] time the whole point behind me getting
[25:18] me hot in this sacred nest is that the
[25:20] Holy Ghost would come down and come
[25:22] through this like brother Keisei jaws of
[25:24] play that you might hear his voice my
[25:28] sheep hear my voice and a stranger they
[25:31] will not follow right here he says Amen
[25:36] in the message of power transformation
[25:37] he said whatever you do don't let the
[25:41] devil spray you spray you with education
[25:46] and poison and stuff like that you don't
[25:50] have to be modern you don't have to be
[25:52] this you don't have to be nothing but
[25:54] sons and daughters of God and if you're
[25:56] born of the word you do right see what
[26:01] we don't we fail to see Amen that this
[26:04] is a great time everybody has money
[26:06] everybody can do this and everybody can
[26:08] do that and money flows it from
[26:09] everywhere big cars and everything there
[26:11] won't be one of them in that city there
[26:13] won't want me not one car not not one
[26:16] airplane right no it'd all be together a
[26:19] different civilization
[26:24] See Mom because we're living on sides
[26:25] and we don't understand we don't worry
[26:27] be careful science will become our God
[26:29] well you know the doctor said I got this
[26:32] and that the other you believe that oh
[26:35] if I don't do this don't you know
[26:38] medication is flu so much I don't
[26:40] understand I was I got to slow down just
[26:42] like they heard the day I'm like here it
[26:45] is when they give you a commercial or
[26:47] something that you looking at this as
[26:49] well this medicine so and so and so it
[26:51] calls its - it calls its fainting it
[26:54] calls it also it calls us this it causes
[26:57] that it calls its this it causes that he
[27:00] just grabbed by the time the list is
[27:03] like that
[27:03] and then at the end of it what you want
[27:07] to take it is good for you yeah that's
[27:16] the truth they tell you about all of
[27:19] these side effects the medication
[27:21] because it may cause II they put it in
[27:24] me like you know but it ain't gonna be
[27:25] me it's really not gonna be me it might
[27:27] cause this with somebody else but you
[27:29] see what I'm saying it's so easy when
[27:31] God said have faith in God we are of a
[27:37] faith civilization how civilized nation
[27:40] is faith like Abraham we call those
[27:43] things that be not as though they were
[27:45] why am I gonna to put something in me in
[27:49] my system that's gonna destroy me at the
[27:52] end of the day ain't happening
[27:56] not going to happen you crazy bro
[28:03] maybe I am but before I let them put
[28:08] radiation in me when I know radiation is
[28:10] cancer itself I rather die believing in
[28:14] Jesus y'all hear me
[28:18] Oh a brother Bruce it's gonna be painful
[28:20] when did you find death not being
[28:22] painful they call it the pains of death
[28:28] and you know I must understand we cannot
[28:32] die we're living in an age where we call
[28:37] the spoken word age and I'm looking at
[28:39] where is it
[28:41] you and I have the ability to speak it
[28:44] we have the authority now you don't
[28:48] believe it ain't happening to you
[28:50] brother madam said the King's sword
[28:52] takes faith it takes a strong hand of
[28:57] faith to make it work and because you
[29:01] lacking some substance or lacking
[29:03] something that you ask God for don't
[29:05] blame God faith will produce it but when
[29:11] we don't have patience to wait and when
[29:13] we don't have have it understand that
[29:15] everything is in God's own timing
[29:19] God don't move by you you move by God
[29:28] escape he said who and he was holding up
[29:34] the rapture who was holding up the
[29:38] rapture somebody's holding you rapture
[29:43] oh I can't hardly wait to the rod to
[29:46] come well you don't wanted to come in
[29:48] you're not living right you're not
[29:52] thinking about you're not walking like
[29:53] you've no wanted to come then the
[29:57] rapture is coming for a holy people of
[30:03] people who are excited about his coming
[30:06] remember that little girl she was
[30:08] already in the door this is about the
[30:10] right season and he's coming she's got
[30:13] her garment all and she's waiting
[30:15] everybody laughed
[30:16] you too religious you got this met the
[30:18] other she didn't care all she could say
[30:21] he promised and look how low the prophet
[30:25] of God is going to glory how long has
[30:27] been do you think we've gotten long time
[30:31] it was late in the evening then things
[30:39] have gotten much worse than that now
[30:42] that then how much more evil can this
[30:47] world take and this evil if you're not
[30:52] faithful in God is going to slow walk
[30:54] you y'all know what I mean by that it
[30:57] will snow walk you little by little you
[31:00] got to realize that Satan is a serpent
[31:02] and serpents slither they move so soft
[31:07] and so slow you don't even hear them
[31:09] coming the next thing you know they up
[31:11] on you're ready to bite
[31:13] that's how sin does seeing the devil
[31:17] don't say hey I'm the devil dude don't
[31:19] you want to party with me nah he doesn't
[31:22] work that way it's just a little at a
[31:24] time it's the truth a little at a time
[31:27] you'll find yourself moving to that
[31:30] music of the world patting your feet a
[31:32] little bit the next thing you know you
[31:34] move it a little bit whoo then ain't
[31:36] nobody around you go go at it that's how
[31:40] it starts
[31:41] little at a time a little video here
[31:45] little something there God the devil
[31:47] don't don't don't expose himself until
[31:50] he's in you or when he done caused you
[31:52] to fall and he's cause you stupid you
[31:54] know better than that why did you do
[31:56] that he's your first accuser and he's
[31:59] the one that made you do it I know you
[32:04] feel bad yeah I feel bad cuz I'll let
[32:07] you make me do this y'all understand
[32:10] what I'm saying but you have to go out
[32:12] to the devil he can't come in if you in
[32:16] this sense Oh Lord the probably God said
[32:21] here God is waiting on us
[32:28] excape I'm gonna get out of this
[32:30] situation because I'm gonna tell you
[32:32] something when satan ties you he doesn't
[32:35] tell you it does simple knot where you
[32:37] could just unloose it easily he's got a
[32:39] professional knot and you don't you
[32:44] don't easily get out of that night you
[32:46] don't get out of that hole unless God
[32:48] comes oh yeah
[32:51] is that the right the Bible said it's
[32:53] the Holy Spirit God who's able to break
[32:55] the tempters snare hallelujah
[32:59] he's the only one Amen that can break
[33:01] the chains that Satan wraps insane he's
[33:04] the only one and I'm gonna tell you
[33:06] something don't be like the Titanic you
[33:09] think that this whole ship can't can't
[33:11] be sunk
[33:13] there's a lot of people wishing like a
[33:16] brother told me not long no I was so
[33:18] shocked to him but basically he was
[33:20] trying to tell me Amen that hell is your
[33:23] imagination is just something you
[33:24] imagine and I said to myself I didn't
[33:26] said to him but I thought to myself I
[33:28] wish I know those people in here wish it
[33:31] was imagination wish that they could
[33:33] come out of it and that's the saddest
[33:36] thing because there's a lot of people
[33:38] who thought they would never go there
[33:39] and they're there just by one thing
[33:44] wearing high-heeled shoes when you all
[33:47] not do y'all love it see you can't go to
[33:58] heaven I'm almost done I'm not gonna
[33:59] keep you long you can't go to heaven
[34:02] back culture no culture it's not gonna I
[34:04] don't care if your culture is the
[34:06] highest level of morality it ain't
[34:09] getting you you could have bigges of
[34:13] dollars that you came by not one seat up
[34:15] there the only way that a man a woman
[34:20] can get to heaven
[34:21] you've got to be born again you say this
[34:24] message is so simple I want it to be
[34:26] simple because that's how Jesus message
[34:27] is worth it was so simple they couldn't
[34:31] even believe that he was God can you
[34:34] imagine sitting up in church and he'll
[34:36] preacher preaching on seeds and
[34:39] everything
[34:40] you know CDs calling your preacher the
[34:42] devil and then he's telling you all has
[34:47] a win gold and as it comes
[34:51] you would never if you warner dave is
[34:54] him as Jesus Christ she would have never
[34:56] seen it you're talking to him and he
[35:01] said well if you're gonna you gonna
[35:02] follow me I don't I don't have no big
[35:04] Church thing where I can put you up in
[35:07] there I'm kind of nice in or something
[35:09] he said I ain't got nothing he said
[35:11] foxes have holes and birds have nests
[35:13] but the Son of Man II he ain't got
[35:14] nobody nowhere to lay his head I don't
[35:16] even have a house you gonna follow me
[35:23] how many of us would have followed him
[35:25] you understand me
[35:27] because now we see the people follow
[35:29] those ones with the big bling blings and
[35:31] big ol chains and all that that rich and
[35:33] driving in the Cadillac and got they
[35:34] women you know like they're you know
[35:36] street prostitutes following them and
[35:38] all that rule Oh Reverend but what about
[35:41] that man who's clean what about that man
[35:44] who's simple who don't have much you
[35:47] know that's why brother branham kept it
[35:49] simple he could he had millions thrown
[35:51] at his feet but he kept his lifestyle
[35:54] simple huh that's why God didn't come
[35:59] down here looking like a Elvis Presley
[36:01] the Bible said there was nothing
[36:03] beautiful for him to look at Jesus he
[36:06] went pretty he wasn't a pretty boy about
[36:09] according to the Bible there was nothing
[36:11] that was gonna attract you to him other
[36:13] than the world that's why God a man he
[36:17] said give me unleavened bread because
[36:19] they not gonna track you to the little
[36:22] bit or a take cinnamon bread and ain't
[36:23] all sweet it ain't all that kind of
[36:25] stuff puffed up is simple on leaven read
[36:29] the Word of God is so simple a day you
[36:32] know meaning a it ain't got all this
[36:34] extra stuff but what's gonna make you
[36:36] love it what's gonna make you eat it
[36:39] which Satan in this data have trance he
[36:42] changed everything anyway we're being
[36:45] changed we're being transformed to do
[36:46] what translate he translated and here
[36:50] here in our walk with God and you sure
[36:52] what brother books hop how did he hear
[36:54] the voice of God
[36:54] God gave involved he didn't have this
[36:56] but then God in our day comes and give
[36:59] us a voice give us something to listen
[37:02] to
[37:02] now I don't know whether you've ever had
[37:04] the experience but I have I've had the
[37:08] experience of listening to a tape going
[37:10] through something didn't even know what
[37:12] I need it was on the tape and it's like
[37:13] the voice speaks directly to me there
[37:19] was a time amen I was running I fell and
[37:21] I hurt my neck so much amen to the
[37:24] doctors wanted to do an operation on my
[37:26] neck and I said God ain't nobody gonna
[37:28] operate on my neck that certain things
[37:30] it won't do ain't gonna do they're not
[37:32] gonna operate on my knee
[37:33] and they're not gonna operate on my neck
[37:37] no and you said what do you mean I go to
[37:41] God before I go to them I was down at
[37:45] Tim Cruz church down there in Louisiana
[37:47] and the Holy Spirit so thick you could
[37:49] cut it with a knife and I'm back in the
[37:52] back with all the old people and the
[37:53] Holy Spirit I heard it boys something
[37:57] say jump I say jump jump jump I jumped a
[38:01] few times and that pain left me it's
[38:04] never been back since you tell me God is
[38:10] not real
[38:10] the preacher didn't tell me the job but
[38:13] that voice did mmm like I was telling
[38:19] one time before Amen way back when I
[38:22] needed a job and everything else and I
[38:24] went to this hotel because the law said
[38:25] you you choose who you want to work
[38:27] that's what people don't understand you
[38:29] can choose where you want to learn I
[38:31] chose to work at this certain place I
[38:34] walked in there fill out my application
[38:36] and I tell you I had on our jacket that
[38:40] was pretty out there but God told me to
[38:46] wear it
[38:46] he said wear this this this and this you
[38:48] know why because God knew what the
[38:50] manager likes when it comes to
[38:52] appearance and I put on that certain
[38:56] outfit and I walked in there fill out
[38:57] the application amen and at the end of
[39:00] the day the man said more I'm so sorry I
[39:03] you know we would love to hire you we
[39:05] went over your application we would love
[39:08] to hire
[39:08] he said but but we have no opening I
[39:11] went oh no I didn't I knew God sent me
[39:16] there
[39:16] I didn't know how it was gonna work out
[39:20] I didn't know how I was gonna open the
[39:22] door he did by the time I got home he
[39:27] had already called my wife and told her
[39:29] to come back to tell him to come back we
[39:32] we got a job offer one that was one of
[39:36] the best jobs I ever had in my life when
[39:41] I got back there he said I'm gonna tell
[39:42] you what made me hire you he said
[39:46] because you came in and here confident
[39:48] he said the clothes you wear this jacket
[39:51] this IDI just tell me everything God
[39:53] told me where the buried the best job I
[39:57] ever had was at that particular place
[40:01] now understand me see when God talks to
[40:05] you it's not yy-you say what brothers
[40:08] what do you say that's what what's
[40:09] happening now those who are I God's been
[40:12] talking to you but you've been not
[40:13] listening you're not been listening you
[40:17] got to hear him you gotta obey Him you
[40:19] gotta walk if you want success in your
[40:20] life do what he said to do it ain't got
[40:24] nothing to do with logic or reasoning he
[40:30] told brother branham he said pick up a
[40:31] rock thrown up in the air all of a
[40:34] sudden the whirlwind comes that's not
[40:38] logical why would I throw a rock up in
[40:40] there because God says huh he told that
[40:45] he told Elijah throw the throw wrong
[40:48] piece of wood in the in the river
[40:50] through a piece of wood in the river and
[40:52] the axe head comes up that's not logical
[40:55] that's faith and that's the kind of
[40:59] civilization we live in we live in a in
[41:02] a faith civilization not science one
[41:06] plus one is two that's man's math God
[41:13] turns it the way he wants to it could
[41:15] mean to the man but it could mean one to
[41:17] God a husband and a wife one plus one
[41:20] equals one
[41:23] see God knows what he's doing and we try
[41:26] to figure him out my point is in closing
[41:28] we've come to be changed if you're not
[41:31] gonna let God change you you don't
[41:33] expect the rapture he comes to change
[41:37] you he will transform you he would
[41:41] translate you now we sit in heavenly
[41:45] places in Christ Jesus and when you're
[41:48] setting in heavenly places in Christ
[41:49] Jesus you know what you're doing you
[41:51] looking down at the devil not up at him
[41:55] because he's made you fall you're
[41:57] looking down at the devil yeah there
[42:04] were other things I needed to say but
[42:06] I'm gonna hold off until this evening
[42:07] let me say it like this people there is
[42:09] not a preacher I don't know I don't know
[42:11] a preacher
[42:12] maybe somebody but nobody's gonna love
[42:15] you like I do as a pastor I'm not
[42:19] arrogant I'm not proud the humility that
[42:25] I have is not some cloak I put on but I
[42:31] care for every soul in here my desire to
[42:38] see everybody make heaven I may not be
[42:41] perfect in the way that you want me to
[42:43] be perfect but I could truly tell you
[42:45] that the love of God in my heart is if I
[42:50] do something I'll say something in this
[42:52] church is because I love you and I mean
[42:54] it and God has told me to say it and
[42:57] I'll be honest with you you know what I
[42:59] was telling somebody the other day I
[43:00] said you know what I was one of the most
[43:02] famous and most popular preachers in
[43:04] this message at one time but in that I
[43:09] saw that was a click there's a circle
[43:12] and y'all may not see it but that's what
[43:15] it really is
[43:16] and if you get in there you can hardly
[43:18] ever get out but in there you can't
[43:21] always do the will of God because this
[43:23] brother don't tell us it with that
[43:24] brother well you can't be a part of that
[43:30] that means
[43:31] I had to either stay a part of that
[43:33] become rich and famous like a lot of the
[43:35] ones have done or just be who I am
[43:39] sitting up in this little place here
[43:41] called higher ground am i ashamed of
[43:44] this little place absolutely not
[43:46] am i ashamed of you absolutely not I
[43:50] always brag on this little church
[43:52] wherever I go you know what I tell them
[43:54] God has given me quality Christians
[43:57] because that's what I believe I'm not
[44:00] looking at your failures I'm looking at
[44:02] your hearts it's what comes from your
[44:05] heart I asked God I said Lord if I'm
[44:07] gonna be a pastor I want to see the
[44:08] people hard I want to see what's in
[44:10] their heart because we're not all all i
[44:14] know is that in your heart you tried to
[44:16] make heaven like i make heaven trying to
[44:18] make Evon that's all I need to know look
[44:22] around you where are the troublemakers
[44:24] God has gotten rid of all the
[44:26] troublemakers I don't I'm not I'm not I
[44:35] don't wanna see no troublemaker go to
[44:36] hell if they repent and come back
[44:37] they're more than welcome but you don't
[44:42] know how blessed you are we're blessed
[44:45] oh we don't have this and we don't have
[44:48] that well maybe God don't want to have
[44:50] this and that but I do want one thing
[44:55] out of us I want us to be family and I
[44:58] want us to love one another I
[45:06] I can't demand respect from then none of
[45:12] you sometimes y'all you don't even know
[45:14] what I'll be hearing from this pulpit
[45:17] but I pray that someday somewhere before
[45:20] God comes God will be revealed to you
[45:23] that I am really your pastor because
[45:26] that's what some of us need to know you
[45:32] sure what brother Brooks you're not here
[45:34] all the time but you know what when I
[45:37] leave here if I'm not here at this
[45:40] church
[45:40] I'll be at somebody else's church oh I
[45:42] meant some post of duty that God got me
[45:45] I'm not out here you know going to
[45:47] Carowinds and you know see the points no
[45:52] I'm on the battlefield for the Lord most
[45:57] of the time when I go places there are
[45:59] no there is no time to rest it's a
[46:03] constant I have people all over the
[46:06] world calling me for counseling I don't
[46:10] shut them down because I passed a higher
[46:12] ground
[46:12] no a brother or sister they need help
[46:16] I'd give them help I'm not gonna even
[46:19] even got everybody that really knows me
[46:21] if I got money to give or give you I'll
[46:23] give it if I don't have it I don't have
[46:28] anybody know me they know that so don't
[46:38] let the devil make you think that
[46:40] something's I'm partial or anything like
[46:43] that that that is the devil you love the
[46:46] Lord blessed and
[46:55] when I pass through the church in Lima
[46:57] hmm I don't need to explain that but God
[47:05] has been good to us and people let me
[47:10] tell you all of the ground is sinking
[47:15] saying bill your house on things eternal
[47:21] all other ground is sinking is in bill
[47:24] your house on things eternal all on the
[47:29] ground
[47:29] it's sinking saying it's gonna fall
[47:35] let us pray father we come before you as
[47:41] humbly as we know how we thank you for
[47:43] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[47:49] we thank you for being so good to us
