in the valleys [Music] that's all right we'll go ahead on with the word look like this boys don't want to cooperate tonight hallelujah god is good to us I am so thankful that God is good to us he's been better to us less saying only believe [Music] this song goes directly with the word tonight we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ it's only a few of us here but the Bible says where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst why everybody else is worried and fretting and everything else the bride is making herself ready this is our what we call happy out this is our time this is our day this is what the prophecies have already been bound up and about and we must embrace it as is it as it unfolds is that right because we know a man who can turn on the light the darkest of all times and in the Gentile history but the Bible said that God has never left himself without a witness all things are possible Oh Neely all leaving we know that the angel the Lord enjoys it so we believe that all these star people holy Lord I believe Lord hi I believe that all things are possible lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] believe that all things are possible Lord Lord I receive yes sir law piracy Lord that all Oh Lord I see let us turn the scripture to Luke 23 Matthew Mark Luke Luke 23 I remember the time in 1977 I was in the Apostolic Church at that time I remember seeing for the first time what we call UFOs being that I have had a little experience in military and and and in the way planes do move and more I knew that what I was looking at was not some airplane or some helicopter and at that time I didn't know this message the way we know it now but I remember screaming and hollering you know I write in the open I don't know what inspired me to say the words that I said but I kept screaming lord whatever you do don't let me miss the rapture and of course 1977 and I believe God gave me this message in in 1983 that's when the message came to me it was during that time I began to understand what I was seeing I didn't know that there had been a prediction that the rapture would perhaps take in 1977 but it was a major things happening during that time those of you who were still babies or yet not born we would like to say that in that time the gospel on the east coast was moving like a wildfire young people teenagers college students they were all being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it was really a newspaper paper thing if you go back in that time you perhaps can look it up because there was such a move of God at that time and of course we didn't understand what was happening but we understand that there was a lot of miraculous things happening in that time and during that time you had PTL and all these other religious programs that were were literally bringing Jesus Christ on the scene but we thank God for His grace because I believe God answered my prayer I believe that I'll see the translation now I want to encourage everybody tonight because we don't know how far this thing can go but I don't believe it's a dress rehearsal I believe this is the real thing and I believe that it will it should bring the bride of Jesus Christ to a place of repentance a place of sanctification a place in making herself ready for the coming of the Lord we can put it off in our minds and we could think that we have another round to go but I think that would be quite foolish I was thinking about this message I thought about how Titus came to Jerusalem to ask as Jesus Christ prophesied he came a few years early and he left and the people thought maybe the prophecy had failed and then Titus come right back around in 80 70 and destroyed Jerusalem that little space that God gave them was a window of repentance a time to get themselves right yet they fail to see what God was doing I believe that this little space that we have right now God has granted us that the bride of Jesus Christ will make herself ready so let us turn to Luke 23 of getting at the 26th verse we don't have to worry about the plagues as long as you are under the blood no no no evil shall come nigh that place that dwelling place he said when I see the Blood I will pass over you amen and as they had led beginning at the 26th verse of Saint Luke and as they had led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a searcher as a serene Ian's coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also be wailed and be Lindt lamented him but Jesus turned unto them and said daughters of Jerusalem we not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children I believe that we're living in that day and time right now but behold the days are coming into which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck then shall they began to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us for if they do these things in the green tree what shall be done in the dry one more scripture let us go to mark the fifth chapter I really meant to ask our sister - saying the blood line but maybe after service if she has it in her notes if not I ain't gonna put the pressure on you but I know one thing that is so true I love that song because it's true the devil can't cross this bloodline mark 5 34 through 43 and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain with certain which said that a is dead why trouble is now the master any further as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he said unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only believe and he suffered no man to follow him say Peter and James and John the brother of James he come into the house of the ruler of the synagogue and see at the to mark and them that wept and wailed greatly and when he was come in he said unto them why did I make you this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth I like the way Jesus look at things and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother and of the damsel and them that were with him and entered in where the damsel was lying and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her Tabitha Kumi which is being interpreted damsel I say in 2d our eyes and straightway the damsel arose and walk for she was of age of 12 and they were astonished with the great astonishment and he charged them straight ly that no man should know it and command that something should be given her to eat one more scriptures forgive me let us turn to Isaiah 21 one thing about the blood of Jesus Christ being applied today we don't have to see it on the doorpost on the lintel but it must be on your heart and the blood applied to your heart is the blood applied by faith amen if you can believe that the blood has been applied the blood has been applied it has nothing to do with the way you feel it is what God has said amen amen I was there 21 6 but thus help the Lord said unto me go set a watchman let him declare what he see it let us pray father God we come before your Lord and we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you Lord for everything you have and is doing for us we pray for those who are here tonight and those who are tuned into the service by way of YouTube we pray father God that you were blessed them in their homes encourage them Lord let them see that the Death Angel has no power over us we thank you for the blood of Jesus Christ we thank you for this hour this is the hour that the bride should be fired up amen knowing that this is her day and the move is on the bride bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I I wanted to give a title to this message that was quite long in the in the title would be the seven seals message is stun during in the ears of the bride it's a long one and so I I told either brother we're just cut it short only believe because you and I understand by God's grace that a system can't save you even though we gather here there's no salvation in this building because salvation only comes by the word and we want everybody to realize tonight amen regardless of what denomination that you may claim to be your denomination can't save you there is no power in it they have all failed God the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and the Bible it's also that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they're cast out Devils we know what mark 16 says but when it comes to the Church of the day we find out that she lays blind and stripped of her powers like Samson but one thing I love about Samson is that he came to recognize that he was no longer the man he used to be but they also came a day that even though his natural eyes had been plucked out he still was able to see and he said perhaps there's a possibility and that that God will restore me and that's what we must understand with God there's always a possibility you never rule out the mercies of God the grace of God because God's mercy into a favor in His grace forever and so you know Samson says Lord once more and I believe this is what the bride is crying out every one of us it meant here tonight uh-uh you know this this this coronavirus staying weather like I said how ever long it goes one thing it is an eye-opener it is something that God is allowing to get our attention while everybody else is fearing and shaking and quaking the bride is saying I know what to do for her his going home time his bride she'd time because the Bible said he'll never leave himself without a witness you and I are here to bring Christ on the scene ooh and and we understand that Christ is not a denomination or organization we know that Jesus Christ is the word because the Bible said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God in the Word was God this word is God in print no matter how many people say is faulty I find no fault in him ma everything has failed the churches has failed every denominations has failed you know it's more to God than singing songs it's more than God in tianjin Church is more to God amen they're just claiming to be a Christian because a Christian is a life it is the life of Christ in a human being I read those scriptures because we know according to the message that this would be a time where people would would wish they hadn't had children and there are those who are glad they didn't have and and we see now that this thing is progressively going to get worse it's going to get worse before it gets better but we need somebody to direct us or something to direct us in this day and time it's like when Moses there in Egypt he wasn't a popular man and and many of the Israel that Raley's didn't like him because you know he was excommunicated forty years before he came back to Egypt he was a fugitive because he he killed an Egyptian but that same man God had already ordained and given instructions to the children of Israel so they could know how to escape out of Egypt in the same time our time God has likened a messenger a people didn't like him but regardless to the way they felt about him it could not take away who he really was and we're talking about the man William Branham many people failed to to listen to him when he lived but we find out that the message in which he's preached has come alive and has always been a lie but now we can see it prophecy is being made clear by these modern events we know the next move hallelujah and you and I must understand that God's bride has never listened his way God has never changed his character Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if there were signs and wonders and miracles at the time of Moses Exodus there must be signs and wonders and miracles at this Exodus we call it the third Exodus we know by God's grace that many things are coming upon the earth and this is only the beginning many people are thinking that this coronavirus is bad is not the worst that is to come and you know that you and I are living in a time amen where everybody is practically insane but they think they have their sanity but they're really insane and it's been proven but nevertheless let's move on we know by God's grace that unbelief is one of the most hideous things that can strike a person is it well I mean unbelief because unbelief doesn't change facts it's like for example somebody might go outside and the sun is shining and they could say I just don't believe that the sun is shining it doesn't change the facts the sun is shining unbelieving to say well I just don't believe Noah ever existed and the ark ever floated the unbelief doesn't change the facts somebody could even say well I just don't believe in God because you don't believe in God doesn't change the fact that God exists and somewhere down the road your unbelief will become belief but during that time it's too late all the people that disbelieve the message of Noah became believers but the time they thought to believe it was too late the rain was falling the door to the OP was closed and this is where we are now we don't know the time or the day that God is going to close the Gentile door is that right because remember no one never shut the door it was God who shut the door so now that we have this time to repent now that we have this time to believe we should believe I love that only believe that means to believe only it gives no space for unbelief hallelujah it gives no space for doubt or fear belief is believing that's all I can do whew I love that now we were talking and I love the story in' because you got to understand that somehow you and i must understand that we must bring christ on the scene and we also must understand that the move is on something is moving right I chose that scripture watchman one of the night see because God always have a watch a watchman somebody always there they can see what God is doing is he has a long-range vision right come you know that's why we needed a prophet we needed a man that God had gifted that can see long-range tell you about the enemy tell you whether it's getting ready to do hallelujah now we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but we also know that the ant illusion day came upon man because of science this Corona virus has come upon men because of science dabbling into God's laboratory in the days of Noah it got out of hand and it caused the flood in that day hallelujah we don't know how far this thing is going to go because I've been told it's mutating it's changing is its character now it's come to do one thing three things steal kill and destroy and you must understand that a jar like that is nothing but demons and so what these people have done is that they have tapped into the laboratory of God perverted it anything perverted becomes demonic and these demons have minds they could think oh no not a little germ a jar that's how cancer starts it starts as a germ in that jar began to multiply and multiply and multiply and eventually that perverted light comes to kill you so is it with these germs after a while the thing that they created will be on build will be beyond anything they would know how to manage you first of all there's no such thing as a cure for viruses hello if there was a cure for virus we would have had a cure for the cold long time ago and that's why the enemy chose a cold or flu because they're known that once this thing starts it had you either have to build an immunity to it or your faith will destroy it somebody help me here because there is no cure for this thing it will move his way up and see well this thing has been going on long time ago and you and I must understand that this is a warfare and I thought God I don't know who started it but somebody knows who started it and if it started with someone don't you understand other countries I'm gonna fight back hmm they're gonna fight back and you saw a brother most well how can i scape there's only one escape it's under the blood of Jesus he is the only one that can stop the move of the devil and what people don't understand is this is Satan's Eden when Satan defeated Adam in the Garden of Eden God gave him right to the world that's why the world began to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse what is it Satan his whole intent was to transform this earth into another hell hello and when the bride of Jesus Christ leave this earth this earth will become hell and Satan will rule it without the mercies of God normally she no more grace and everybody's that's left behind will experience the true power of an evil force that we call the devil Lucifer somebody help me here you see cause sicknesses of the devil it never came in by God it came by the fall by our choosey and because we chose a mentor to follow Satan or Lucifer because remember as long as you stay with the word you are worshiper of God but when you leave the Word of God then you worship something else so we we look at this thing and we see that Jesus is on the scene and what oh I think are for the Lord Jesus they've been great prophets that came but no one no one no one is like Jesus Christ he was the king of kings and the Lord of lords Easter he's the prophet of all prophets hallelujah and his word never fails that's what I'm trusted in tonight he well I never failed it was this woman who had seen Jesus doing a lot of miracles and I've got a hurry we've seen it you know she had heard of Jesus doing miracles and here was this a woman who had an issue of blood and no doubt she was perhaps going through menopause and she hadn't had this this issue of blood for 12 and long years and I can imagine her she went to the Baptist and they couldn't do nothing and she went to the Methodist and they couldn't do nothing and she went to the Presbyterian they couldn't do nothing in it because they don't they believe that the days of miracles are past she went to every Church no doubt the Bible is that right she had how many seven husbands how many was she had it men are doctors whether she had gone through these doctors and yet not one of them could heal her disease but she saw Jesus she had heard that he could stop he could heal it y'all hear what I'm saying and no doubt in the crowd he is a crowd now this woman in said well I'm going to touch the hem of His garment I saw this this condition had already bent over I love this position because it's a a position of humility it's a place of humbleness and somehow she got down and that's what a lot of people they want to be healed they want to be delivered but they don't know how to get down this lady got down and she touched the hem of His garment she said no word there was no Bible but a revelation struck her if I could would just touch the hem of His garment I would be made whole maybe that's what we need tonight but in order for us to be made whole we got to humble ourselves ah not looking this way look at this way looking down it says oh if I could just touch the hem of His garment only believe now I'm coming to some things because he said first of all be not afraid you understand me you can't fear and believe at the same time fear and faith doesn't work together somebody help me here you either are frame all you believe somebody help me so we find out that this y'all remember Jarius I like Jerry's because he was a a high-class Centurion or whatever he was and he had a daughter I think she was about 12 years old and she fell sick now the pressure of this whole situation was that - in order to follow this man called Jesus who was nondenominational he wasn't part of the Pharisees he wasn't a part of the Sadducees he wasn't a part of the huronian he was not a part of filling it with any of them so much so they asked him one time Jesus tell me where did you get your authority in other words what school of divinity did you attend hallelujah oh my and of course he could not respond to them in the way that they wanted him to respond but they could not say he didn't understand the scripture because even at the age of 12 Jesus confounded the Pharisees in the scripture they tried to tie him up many times and I love this scene when Jesus they asked Jesus uh where you get your authority he said I'll tell you what you tell me where John the Baptist get got here's and then I'll tell you where I got mine hallelujah then the air communica council got together this and I we tell him these things he don't say well why didn't you believe him and follow him and they came up they huddled up they broke out of the huddle hallelujah ha ha and they came to Jesus says master we cannot tell I love this scene because Jesus was no pushover hallelujah and he said because you cannot tell me he said neither can I tell you hallelujah see because they knew that if they said they did believe in John the Baptist there were people there that would have stoned them you love the Lord be not afraid this is not a time to fear keep your eyes on Jesus this this time is for you stars of God more than cause you are hallelujah we are the ones who are heralding the coming of the Messiah hallelujah we know what we believe we know where we're headed we know what's in front of us yes we're gonna have some trials we're gonna have some tests Satan is gonna bring but the Bible the Word of God tells us when this day will Chris everyone every high wave he brings to all of us we will class it we will get over it hey this is the hour that the bride of Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ in the person of the bride will conquer Satan don't fear him I don't care what he oh hey you know let me let me go back to Joe God had confidence and joke he brought the trials God had confidence in you he put you in this age he knows you're going to conquer God is not betting on you and like oh I think he's gonna do it God knows that you've got what it takes you may not even see it yourself like Samson lost his identity but all he had to do was cry says Oh Lord once more this is not about emotional you may not be one that shouting jumping dancing all of that data in it but that faith is what anchors your soul once you know that that's in your heart Satan cannot take it from you whoo job says Lord naked I came into this world and naked I will return we know the bride won't return naked we come back with character hallelujah and every test that we go through is for our good hallelujah they came to Jarius the daughter had been so sick maybe she had the coronavirus maybe she had something like that and you know here she was 12 years old she started with a fever hallelujah and before Darius could get to her hey the nerd the news came Darius Oh Jerry don't worry about it your daughter is dead oh my no doubt she was horrified he was horrified at the fact that his only little daughter is dead he didn't stop there cuz he knew a man who could turn on the light he knew the man who could change everything because he's seen him in action when you once see Jesus in action all you got to do is know that he can do it again hallelujah hallelujah jesus said don't you worry about it Jarius be not afraid just only be mean and one thing about I loved about Jesus this is what I loved about it because the pressure the squeeze that we know that it's coming it's gonna remove all the unbelievers Oh God gonna have left as real believers all the faith all the make believers they gonna leave this message they go shout out for bread and food and whatever more but the real believer naked I come naked I return blessed be the name of the Lord even if my barely got to crawl and scroll it everything else for food they don't have to do it why because I have a greater meat hallelujah the Lord is my meat the Lord is my sustainer man does not live by bread alone but every word that proceedeth the mouth of God Oh Lu you it's gonna come tough but where will you be standing on the promises of God hallelujah you see that's all the bride has now he promised her she was gonna return and everybody gonna laugh and makes come on oh I thought you said the rapture was gonna take place it's coming you see me I haven't disappeared yet but one of these old days when you can't find me that means I'm going right you think you know the day an hour I don't know but I can see the dust in the wind I can see him coming I see what's happening right now and I gotta make sure there's no spot no wrinkle no blemishes hallelujah all my attitude all my desires that a word must disappear don't you worry it's something how the devil does he you know back in the day they used to hire people for funerals did you all know that yeah especially if you don't have that many people in your house they hired people you ever seen those old movies and all those women with a mum with you they would call mourners and so they would hire people to cry for you and model for you hallelujah and guess what Jesus put them all at the house there's no choirs in this house hallelujah there's nothing but peace why because Jesus is here hallelujah when Jesus stepped in the door he could care less how long tabatha or other daughter of jairus was dead he knew he was a resurrection and that's what I'm talking about we don't care that let the virus they gonna come but you know what God has already ordained people who has the ability to call them back we can't be afraid not even of death because we have the power of the resurrection not enough ABAB he's in us the Bible said the life and death is in the tongue whew somebody I know you might find this to be strange but the other day I was just thinking about a brother thinking about a brother and my phone Dow the brother God is my witness I'm like what is this and I checked all you know how you have those recent calls I check all my recent calls and make sure was nowhere on the list you know to make sure I didn't pop and he wasn't in my pocket he was right there and it just called I was just thinking about it and it died I don't understand it y'all can say well it's something happened something did happen but my thought was that God hugged me thinking oh and he dialed the brother for me that might sound crazy to you but it was just a token for me it was something that God gave me to say don't worry brother Brooks hallelujah in that day and hour I'll hear your call and I answer your call well I feel like screaming hallelujah when I think about this thing in the world what the world is going through I was thinking about cried this morning I was thinking about all of the things that's happening to these innocent people to these people who don't know better do these people who don't even have a shelter they don't even know that Jesus Christ is alive and well and they don't know that Jesus Christ is the answer to the crisis hallelujah we know that America won't repent but the Bible said if my people they which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways he said I were here from heaven and heal their land but they're not gonna do it they bypassed it every since 1956-57 they were waived and tried in the balance that was when a miracle was supposed to repent and they didn't they crossed the line and you can see from that time on to the 60s on up we became more corrupt more corrupt more corrupt we're more corrupt than we ever this is the very how could this is the dark ages of the Gentiles hmm this is the dark ages but God has never left himself without a witness and I want you to understand that every witness of God was the individuals who look insane to those who were insane hey it's alright if they think you crazy because you know you got better sense than them is that right it's the truth listen you don't think the people are crazy I'm gonna give you an example in i'ma go ahead on in the time that Jesus crossed over to the Galleria right the man who had legions this man had so many devils he was stripping his clothes off he was naked like the day naked and don't know it but at least leisure news he had he was full of Davos but the people stripped their clothes now and don't know that they insane now I tell me they're not insane they go to beaches in it along the way US bikinis are kooky knees whatever you want to call it when I in my day you would've been locked up for in this indecent exposure in my day a man couldn't even walk the street with his shirt off in my day let's move on but nothing changed other than the people have become insane they said if you feel like doing it do it mercy understand in Isaiah it says Amen the morning cometh also the night and just not long ago I was driving early morning and it was so the darkness was different I said to my wife something different about it and I had no idea that Corona was on the way [Laughter] somebody help me yeah yeah better you know we got to realize this is serious we don't know how bad is going to get but remember now when the Black Plague hit Eaton would they thought that the Jews were witches because they were the only ones that didn't get sick but you know what that was they knew how to live clean huh their food was clean their clothes were clean they knew how to bathe they knew how to keep the germs off somebody help me is your truth and here we are today and then in a world and they say oh if I wash my hands that gonna keep him saying if I stay inside that's gonna keep me safe there's no safe place you can shut everything down but it doesn't kill the virus it lives on whatever they create it will continue to live and gonna wait until it gets another subject is that right how many of you had the flu more than once right and understand it's not going down in my car I'll cut down the casualties but we know what's happening don't we people y'all know what they're doing yeah they're trying to depopulate cut down on the number of people and they want to get rid of the elders and all of that first of all Oh help me Jesus they're gonna look at me and Ruby said why y'all still livin hallelujah you know why because the blood of Jesus protects us it's the truth yeah I don't have to take a vaccine or nothin like that I i'm already naki lady yeah the sun is approaching understand when that Sun began to approach what was brother branham let me say like you know what was his type when he came you see people didn't understand him because they they couldn't understand a man who was so clothing humility he never pushed himself he never say I'm the big guy I'm the Superman no he actually promoted Jesus Christ it was Jesus Christ he was here reflecting and representing not some man he was trying to get us to see that the morning star is here and if the morning stars Jesus Christ that means that the Sun is about to rise hallelujah and he preached the message is the rising of the Sun what was he saying it's coming darkness the darkness is grows you can feel it I hope I'm not whining too much old people can understand me but but what is is that this darkness is going to get greater but is that the greater and denser it becomes it proves that they're coming a breaking of the day did you know that light darkness a certain time of the morning began to fight and that darkness conjugates and get darker than ever but that light is stronger than darkness and it pushes that darkness right out of the way hallelujah like will always defeat darkness but but let me move on but what people don't understand and in the time of Egypt I love the story because when it got dark that's when it was the time that the Death Angel moved right and the Bible's call it plagues it was the plague of death and that Death Angel killed and destroyed every firstborn child that was not under the blood of Jesus Christ oh they can say well wait a minute I belong to the great church of Moses oh the great church of Abraham Abraham was my father he founded this church that death agent could care less they can say all praise God I was I was I was circumcised under Abraham's Authority you know he told us that we had to be circumcised eight day on the eighth day I'm circumcised that didn't work God could care less about that circumcision he told Moses put the blood on the doorpost and their little God don't care about you being a member of a church he want to see the blood he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you the blood the blood and this day is the baptism of the holy ghost who know it is darkest before dawn right oh my eat listen silence science you know claims it's the night see the Sun approaching pressing coming on pressing and conjugate congealing the the night together because it's known as just got to got a little while and the day were break and that's the way it is that devil know his time is short he knows he's just got a little while now see because once the bride its raptured once we're taking flight he's only got about what three and a half more years to do his thing and then Christ in the ages of God in the service of God and the Bride of Christ comes back and we rule this earth for a thousand years he knows but just like I preached the other night Satan want to overthrow God he thinks that because of what took place in the Garden of Eden when Adam failed that was like a type of God falling God cannot fall hallelujah hey man the only thing that God did for me was that he became my sin that I might become his righteousness he didn't just fall he gave it up he said I lay down my life and I pick up again I'm excited about this I could have been in the Buddhism I could have been Islamic hallelujah I could have been here and do ISM hallelujah but there's only one God there's only one living God and that is the Lord Jesus Christ and he proves himself every day whoo you see old brother books what are you saying you know that watchman stands out there that preacher standing this is what I've been trying to tell people you gotta have the Holy Ghost brother books you ain't deep enough you gotta have the whole he goes now we're at a place right now how deep is deep y'all know what I'm saying they got the education they got there that there's stimulation of their mind and God don't care nothing about that he wants to see the blood on the heart hallelujah let's see where everybody's standing now that this thing is pressing upon us you know what we need to do we need to redeem the time we need to find places somewhere we can pray and let God come and change our hearts because God don't care how long you've been in this message and how many things you know about brother Branham and how many pictures you got on the wall like I preached amen that's all some people God is a picture on the wall hallelujah and God is far more than a picture on the wall and you can you can say all kind of nonsense nonsense we've been deceived and and duped by the devil because he's kept us from the baptism he's kept us from the Holy Ghost just like all the other denomination they pushed it on out of the way and they wanted to look really nice and pretty god don't care about no you looking pretty he want to see a mess he want to see a atmosphere that will bring forth acts 2:38 babies screaming and hollering and speaking in tongues and jumping and shouting and all the miracles that follows that's the kind of church people are afraid of whoo yeah is that all right you know what our inspiration comes from heaven that's why we act the way we do that's why we live the way we do that's why we dress the way we do hallelujah you're not gonna find those striptease in heaven oh no everything is holy everything is holy from the top of the neck all the way down to the feet yes sir ain't gonna be no lust in a bear that's of the devil hope people that's beastly that's the animal that's the part that the devil gave us by way of the serpent that's why the Bible said that God ah that's got to die in order to inherit heaven heaven amen oh my see they said it couldn't be done and now the presbyterian the Methodist and the Baptist and seeking for it and in the pillar cultures are blind enough not to see the hour are you blind this is what I'm looking at this is the hour you know it's like his disciples remember I said this the other day I said Jesus at the hour is come where the Son of Man will be betrayed oh Lord you know how they they were more concerned about who was going to betray him then they were about the hour that was coming hallelujah and that's basically what we're doing we're more concerned about the hours the people who gonna be with that none of your business you just make sure he says listen he said it's so dark I want you understand this is that our God is giving this is our you can't say Lord stop it stop it you can't stop it it's already in motion it can't stop it has to do what it's got to do but then there was those three Peter James and John who represented the church at a time they should have been praying Jesus had come come pray with me come pray with me my hours at hand they're gonna persecute me they're gonna crucify me come pray with me all I ask you to do is pray within one hour and the Bible said they could not even pray with them one hour him without one hour without hid them going to sleep Jesus coming here wake him awake him pray pray he realized it the devil had him see the darkness is so thick y'all know how it is it's hard to pray it's really hard to pray you get on your knees and guess what the next thing you know you hear C is the same anointing it's the same thing that Satan is laying the darkness is holding and as soon as the devil comes he knows when the weakest Saint gets on his knee something has to happen so he stops you right there by putting his sleep and tired it's the same way we're studying you can read anything you want to you can listen to anything you see anything on your phone read your Bible Oh help me Jesus y'all knows the truth his demonic power was fighting against you because of the hour we're living in help us Jesus don't let us fall into the same snares because then he told Peter James and John said 'hey you got to pray unless you fall into these temptations keep us out of the temptations and it shows that here was peter when the temptation came on him he just fooled it when they came that crucified jesus the first thing he did it took the sword and he tried to cut the means listen the bottom said this is not the bride you don't fight with the sword you don't need guns you don't need arrows you don't need anything like that hallelujah is that right because the miracle worker is with you somebody help me here when that here came off of that soldier Jesus was right there to pick it up had he not Peter would have been charged with murder but I loved about Jesus he put the ear on the man and he covered the evidence there was no evidence that Peter tried to kill him so he had no witnesses hallelujah so will it be in the squeeze when we make the wrong move God will make the right one Hey he has a purpose he had a purpose for us we can't be afraid of this our hallelujah when you got God on the inside the greatest enemy of the church is death and true believers are not afraid to die whoo no sir we don't have to be afraid you know a lot of times you know what I'm gonna tell you what what hinders us is our pride hallelujah you know but I always see you know who I wouldn't meet I want to meet Lazarus the one who was at the Richmond table I don't understand that I want to know him when I get to heaven and says how did you do it because the Bible says in the Old Testament it says neither have I seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread but there were you you were there you were begging bread he was at the Richmond table but there's a scripture did you feel like God had failed you hallelujah but I can see him there's no show I had a revelation God put me in that position he wanted me to be there hallelujah why because I stand as a witness against the rich young ruler hallelujah when the rich young ruler was called a preach amen he refused it and he found his soul in hell hallelujah when the rich man was called God by God he says listen sell all that you have and follow me the rich man said I can't do it I've been a good Christian I've done all the good things that a Christian supposed to do but to give up everything I have and see that's what's happening God is calling you now to give up everything hallelujah and listen he's going to force the issue somebody help me here he forced the issue Satan knew he said listen I know why you love jobs yo you love job you love to because you know job job is been your God you have protected him you got a hedge around him you've been good took that's why he serve you ha ha hallelujah but God said I know jobs hard he loves me because he loves me for who I am and not because of what I can give somebody help me here and so what happened the devil put the thing on job and God says listen you can do whatever you want to take his cattle take his children take his house take his wife take whatever but don't touch that all in the wine hallelujah don't take that part of him that I predestinated hallelujah that's when God has Joe when he was on the ass she Joe what were you where were you Joe if Joel wonders Trudy says I was that before the foundation of the world I was there hallelujah because I was there that's why I was able to stand here whoo somebody help me to see my strength just didn't come back when I was born in this world I had strength before I came I had a seed German me Amen that laid there that protected me when the bullets threw over my head when people tried to kill me Amen God was protecting the seed in me hallelujah y'all hear me me and my friends running from the gods in the bullets hallelujah not one of them touch me why God show me here today he it was the seed of God in me God protected me when I was a sinner what about now Jesus Jesus II I can't I could tell you some things but I'm gonna tell you something I there was a time I don't know but I believe that you don't want me to say that but there was a time that I was close to death but God I didn't even know him but he knew me hallelujah where you stand some of the virtues brought how you gonna be virtuous Harmon be clean how I'm gonna get this way I'll tell you how we do it we allow God to do it only God can clean your heart you can't clean it that's why he put it behind reach you can't reach in there hallelujah only God can going in while I say clean he washes it by the blood of the Lamb if you trust God he'll do it for you have faith in God tonight don't be afraid it was coming yes if you are out of the work you know enjoy your holiday hard times are coming yes hard times are coming hallelujah but I want to say something to you tonight nothing can change your predestination if God has already elected you to be bride you'll be there is that right look at Peter ha he messed up did not Jesus three times but God had already promised in McKees and who was the spokesman on the day of Pentecost Peter himself huh nothing can take away God what has he what God has for you it is for you nothing can stop that oh but I'm so glad I'm elected who I yes God is calling the elected calling the virtuous bride the word the last day church the elected lady of our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus is the word how many believe that hallelujah alright then the bride is already part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination I'll have to be she'll have to be the word right manifested to be the Bride of Christ that's the part of life manifested manifested that means Christ has the seen through you hallelujah that don't mean that all of us got to be Superman and leaping over with buildings and it with a single bound hallelujah you can be a dishwasher and still be the bride of Jesus Christ whoo hallelujah see he promised to do it he said how he did it never never loses his pattern is that right he's always did it by the pattern he done it every time by the pattern he does it again calling on his virtuous bride in the last day and that's what he's doing down I believe with all of my heart when God woke me up the other morning he said I've given them space to repent and they will not repent there'll be a lot of people who will not repent even in this time because Satan got them thinking they got more time you don't have more time and let me say it like this if I had more time would it not be ready for me to the wisdom of the whole thing is to make myself ready it's better to stand still in the doorway waiting on him then to try to make everything right when he knocks those who are left behind don't have no idea what they're in for hallelujah can I go back let me tell you something historically there have been men raised up a man who was anointed by pure Devils who literally destroyed mankind because they were different hallelujah and in every race they did it not just the white race but every race have been wicked like that starting from the Garden of Eden you had a Nimrod and everybody else yeah right it's true we looked at him like he was a war he was one of those but there have been many before they're right and you gotta understand people when you talk about yeah I don't care about Hitler no more than I care about some black leader oh you better say that hey my leader is God he leaves me there's no good thing in the flesh hallelujah you know who brought me to freedom Jesus did people look at these people cause I tell people you know people got some strange thing where Jesus was black who cares I don't care if he's you know polka dot stripe green but who cares he died for my sin I want to see him if he's the ugliest thing in heaven I'm gonna show enough run up to him and kiss him i'ma hug him because he'd be the beautiful thing that I heathens have been the most beautiful thing that I ever seen well I will see in heaven will be Jesus Christ himself I don't care about no golden streets and you know gold and Nissen pearly gates all those things are good but I want to see I want to see him yeah he's people oh he was a Jew he was not but he was he was not he wasn't Joseph's son neither was he Mary's son he was God's Son and Mary was just an incubator Jesus God created the body and the blood none of that blood was Joseph's and none of it was Mary if it had been we would still be sinners he chose that race but understand the promised seed was never to be a natural seed it was a promise seed it was a seed of God that replace Adam is that right about said Jesus was a quickening spirit the second Adam somebody help me here see how I get so tired of these people trying to national nationalize Jesus like that's gonna be a plus for them they're just as many evil black as there is white yellow and every other color amen all of us born in seeing shaped in iniquity come out speaking life confidence in that kind of stuff that's that's foolishness that's carnal yeah and the devil still got us thinking that one race is more superior than the other oh I could say some things on that but God won't let me but let me tell you this we die the same way we're born the same way we bleed the same way we lie the same way we steal the same ain't no superior race don't even say it don't even think that you know let's move on because the lot could be said and you know when when when it comes to that people still believe that they are an Indian and they and you know can never say this let me say like this like the Prophet said what happens if when we get to heaven Jesus is a color that's different from all colors and what you gonna do woo yeah my color who cares ah you know I don't care about first of all those are people who like tall people he won't be tall he was short and what's gonna happen there right cause you know that's this issue today people think they greater ain't no greater without the blood of Jesus Christ you all dying see every race can I say let me see this and I don't know why I'm on this but you gotta understand what happened after the fall wonder who Nimrod was and don't you understand before the continental drift everybody was the same color it was a continental drift that changed the colors of the flowers hallelujah the white man went to the north that's why his nose is this way to block out the cold weather so it wouldn't freeze his brain No and this is why ours is wide we went south we were in the hot comfy cut so our noses are open now I can chop it on down but guess what the white man can give a black man blood transfusion the black man can give a white man we give a Chinese with you it shows we all come from the same people let me move on I'm stirred see because we got to realize this coming a tormenting spirit this devil is coming listen and what we fail to see is that after the first world war the lid of hell was open and demons flowed out of hell and they landed a ban first of all they they were in Germany influencing Stalin Hitler and Mussolini and they destroyed the Jews and look what they did to those people that was just a picnic compared to what they're getting ready to do now because they went into Hollywood and Hollywood went into hell y'all know they devil worshippers they went into hell and they began to pull out everything oh that's a horror movie that's from Hell that's what they do there all these hideous things that they did and they what did they they put it on the street screen and you're thinking you're looking at something fictitious and what you fail to see is that you was looking at the reflection of what was going on in hell and those same things that people that watch is going to come back and torment them when God leaves when the bride of Jesus Christ leaves those same thing will work on their imagination and cause them to hallucinate so they will see grasshoppers tallest building locust is and everything else and it'll be so real hmm they talk about zombies and I'm off my nose but I might go ahead on with it they don't even understand that brother branham prophesied that they're coming a germ warfare and he said that germ will cause the flesh of men to rot on them while they're living and the birds will come down him again to eat off of their flesh while they're living so we had it in writing before Hollywood brought in on the screen hello and it's coming it's coming you love the Lord Oh what is it it's through science and the food the hybrids that's perverted the whole human body till we become a bunch of a massive corruption if the physical being is corrupted is it the brain cell in that physical being now watch the spirit follow it there comes a time in the name of the Lord that people would be completely insane y'all don't think they are saying they are fighting over toilet paper that's insanity can't eat toilet paper but that's how they fight don't make sense you know people kill each other over the least little thing let me move on I hope I'm not going too long but anyway my watch is stopped now follow me there comes a time in the name of the law that people would be so completely insane the bible says so they're screaming how a great hideous things in their imaginary mind the radios and things our television programs are producing it there be such things as as ant raise up in the earth that would be as high as 14 trees a man a bird would fly across the earth with wings four to five miles across and people are people to see them they're screaming hollering cried for mercy but it'll be the plague is that right I read to you the scripture in that day they gonna say blessed is the womb that never bared blessed is that one who's not with child that day is I mean it's approaching us now but when the bride of Jesus Christ is raptured the people have no protection there's no more blood to protect you right now the blood of Jesus Christ circles the earth and it keeps even the sinner Amen from places where the devil would take them but once that blood is taken away from the earth you have no protection totally insane I know people think I'm crazy but we'll see down the road we're going to see you know it's the truth now let me say it like this Cain killed Abel and it was a horrible situation right now we look at movies and they killing each other and blowing each other up you know chopping each other up and everything we're not even moved by it when one act when Cain killed Abel alarm God now we see so much blood it doesn't make was desensitized we loved it and you were getting that get that moving we get all in there and you don't even realize that you become a part of a murder scene because your heart has confessed kill him Satan has pulled you into that and God will judge you for it you see and what we don't understand is that Satan is smart he's Lucifer he knows I'm a move on y'all y'all love the Lord oh he's calling to the bride he's calling to the right and this is what I must say is difficult to fight the invisible enemy if you could see him you'll know how to work it because he's invisible that's one thing about the church in the early days they knew who the enemy was they died because they could see their enemy they knew what the enemy was doing but now I enemy is spiritual we can't always see where he's hiding hallelujah but if we stay in the blood we have a defense he can come out us but he can't get to us why because he can't cross the blood line ha ha ha hallelujah you look at these things they were Brotherhood's what are you saying I'm gonna tell you something like this the blood of Jesus Christ is so powerful I've got loved ones right now who ain't living right but so did job Joel was a shot of the type 7 children that was restored hallelujah and let me tell you something I got the bloodline that is being applied hallelujah protecting them right now from Satan taking their souls to hell I believe that if God did it for job gotta do it for me this is the great hour that's when the hope of more mortals life has finished and you and I we know we're breaking into that you know look at the wickedness of man and let me say like this and I'm a closed because I can't finish all of this but you've got to believe now the move is on you you got to stop we got to stop this foolishness and being afraid of what's happening here you got to understand and say listen I've got a I've got I've got a claim I've got to pull up I've got to be the person I've been been professing to be all all my Christian and walking all my Christian life God is depending on me hallelujah and I believe that if God in Northeast Sampson he could take the jawbone of an ass and kill hundreds of people what about us that's a shadow of the type God cannot be overcome and neither can he be overthrown let me say like this recognize who you are if you are a son and daughter of God you are greater than the Angels hallelujah and understand you are a higher order than Lucifer and all of his demons and you mean to tell me you gonna let a law order defeat you no shock the Bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord will lift up a standard you are the standard Christ in you the hope of glory you are the powerhouse you don't have to go look forward here to come but when comes God is standing with you Carter stand for you I look at those ones whose you know I love Joseph because Joseph never lost faith in God his brothers betrayed him threw him in the ditch he ended up Amen in Egypt as a slave hallelujah for years mistreated but he still trusted in God that's what I'm telling you it doesn't matter the hardship that we might have to be fought but that would befall us the hard times we got to come they are today ordained but you see one thing about delayed love the Bible said love conquers all things and if you have the real love of God in you it will conquer everything everything the Satan comes with you it will listen is that right one thing I know that's why the Bible said if somebody rail on you you don't rail back let love project like the bull the bull had to back up it had to stand still the bees had to turn around because law was projected that's your defense hallelujah the devil get all up in your face and all you got to do is says lord have mercy Father forgive them for they know not what they do can you imagine we're not when the soldiers and the enemies of said Jesus heard Jesus pray that faith that prayer they must have melted like butter oh my god what kind of man is this that can still forgive us with what we have done to him you love the Lord all right so much I want to I just have to finish this on Sunday Lord's will but yeah I will I'm just trying to encourage the people only believe is where I'll pick up on Sunday Lord's will only believe only believe keep believing don't know your message it's right this message is running 100% right everything that God is going to do and what happens you said what do you mean understand this that God ill he will bring us another anointing he will bring us a greater anointing right now the anointing has been lifted lifting off the earth and that's why I've been too hard to pray and hard to do this but God allowed that so Satan can come in and do what he has to do but now Satan is at the place where God is getting ready to out pour upon the wheat and the terrier remember the pair Lord send us a ring citizen citizen ring and and when they both wheat and tear cried out for the rain the rain came yes it's the time this is the time that all believe us weed and tear will is crying out because they know that only God can fix this problem and they're saying Lord send us the revival you know why because we know we don't that the condition of this world is because of the backsliding Christian if the Christians had held their ground we would have
