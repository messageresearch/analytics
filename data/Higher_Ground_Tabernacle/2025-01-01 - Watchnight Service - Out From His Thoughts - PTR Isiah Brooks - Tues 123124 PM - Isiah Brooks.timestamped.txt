[1:18:51] done genesis4
[1:18:55] and God saw the light that it was
[1:18:59] good and God divided the light from The
[1:19:07] Dark One More scripture and I'll let you
[1:19:09] be
[1:19:10] seated isah
[1:19:28] beginning at the 16th
[1:19:30] verse 14
[1:19:34] Isaiah they that see thee shall narrowly
[1:19:38] look upon thee and consider thee saying
[1:19:43] is this the man that made the Earth to
[1:19:46] tremble that did Shake kingdoms
[1:19:57] that made the world as a Wilderness and
[1:20:00] destroyed the cities thereof that open
[1:20:04] not the house of his
[1:20:10] prisoners all the kings of the Nations
[1:20:14] even all of them lie in glory everyone
[1:20:17] in his own house
[1:20:24] but thou are cast out of thy grave like
[1:20:27] an abominable branch and as a r
[1:20:30] arraignment of those that are slain
[1:20:33] thrust through with a sword that go down
[1:20:35] to the stones of the pit as a ccus
[1:20:38] trodden under
[1:20:51] feet thou shall not be joined with them
[1:20:54] in burial because thou has destroyed thy
[1:20:57] land and slain thy people the seed of
[1:21:01] the evilo shall never be
[1:21:12] reowned let us pray our Heavenly Father
[1:21:15] God we come before
[1:21:17] you know
[1:21:19] how Lord we thank you for our portion of
[1:21:22] Life health and strength

[1:21:30] completely out of your
[1:21:32] way speak to your people
[1:21:36] tday we'll come into the new
[1:21:40] year Victory
[1:21:43] Lord knowing that is your
[1:21:45] grace that have kept us and knowing that
[1:21:49] you are The Keeper of the
[1:21:52] Soul bless us here tonight
[1:21:55] Hallelujah as we give you
[1:21:58] glory honor Lord give us
[1:22:02] Grace complely out of
[1:22:05] wayless of the
[1:22:09] Worden amen you may be
[1:22:16] seated I believe everybody here tonight
[1:22:19] believe that we're living in the last
[1:22:21] days
[1:22:25] and we all
[1:22:26] understand that the world is falling
[1:22:31] apart there's never been a generation
[1:22:33] like this
[1:22:35] one so much so that brother vam called
[1:22:38] it the god of uh Satan the God of this
[1:22:40] evil
[1:22:45] age but I want you to understand in all
[1:22:49] that you
[1:22:50] see and everything your natural SES
[1:22:53] declare to you
[1:22:56] all is a
[1:22:58] lie if it stands against the
[1:23:02] word you see God has a
[1:23:05] purpose and we are part of
[1:23:08] it I love that because whatever his
[1:23:12] purpose
[1:23:13] is for us it can never be
[1:23:18] changed you know I preached the last
[1:23:21] time I was
[1:23:22] here how that the elect it cannot be
[1:23:26] replaced if you are chosen by
[1:23:29] God to make a Rapture nothing can hinder
[1:23:33] that that that's God's
[1:23:36] purpose you wonder why it's so dark
[1:23:41] now God is a god of
[1:23:44] contrast the darker the atmosphere
[1:23:49] is the brighter the Christian
[1:23:53] is you know we we we we fail to
[1:23:57] see that the God grace of God is
[1:24:01] Sovereign is that right it is he is the
[1:24:06] supreme
[1:24:09] ruler whatever God has
[1:24:12] determined for you and I it's going to
[1:24:16] come to
[1:24:18] pass you know without God's
[1:24:22] grace we could never do his will
[1:24:26] his will is
[1:24:27] Sovereign God has a way of changing
[1:24:31] things to bring us to the
[1:24:34] place where we will stand in his
[1:24:38] will yall understand what I'm
[1:24:41] saying if his thoughts of
[1:24:45] you has already been
[1:24:49] determined and you really truly
[1:24:53] believe
[1:24:55] reation his thoughts were of
[1:24:59] you and his thoughts as the scripture
[1:25:03] says will give us an expected
[1:25:08] end listen what he says brother says and
[1:25:12] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:22] life7 he make you may you take me to
[1:25:27] record this this morning or record this
[1:25:30] this
[1:25:34] morning there isn't enough
[1:25:39] power
[1:25:41] hell can ever
[1:25:44] defeat the purpose of
[1:25:48] God God will do it
[1:25:52] anyhow see we all make
[1:25:56] mistakes but God is not looking at the
[1:26:00] mistakes he's actually looking at the
[1:26:04] commission hallelujah hallelujah you see
[1:26:07] none of us can add one cubit to our
[1:26:11] statue hallelujah hallelujah that's why
[1:26:14] the Bible
[1:26:15] says that wait upon the
[1:26:18] Lord shall renew their
[1:26:21] strength Mount up with wings
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:29] and not
[1:26:32] fu is that right I read the scripture
[1:26:35] Isaiah
[1:26:38] 14:24 it said the Lord of host have
[1:26:42] sworn saying surely as I have
[1:26:47] thought so shall it come to
[1:26:50] pass and as I have purposed
[1:26:54] so shall it
[1:26:57] stand my subject tonight is out from his
[1:27:02] thoughts Hallelujah we didn't know
[1:27:05] nothing about God's
[1:27:07] thoughts matter of fact we thought that
[1:27:10] uh God was something somewhere up here
[1:27:14] and down here
[1:27:17] somewhere but the Bible said that God is
[1:27:20] not far from
[1:27:22] you the Bible said that
[1:27:30] Hallelujah even in thy
[1:27:33] mouth Hallelujah But realize and
[1:27:36] recognize what God is
[1:27:39] doing as he did in Genesis
[1:27:43] one he separated the darkness from
[1:27:48] light Hallelujah when I was in a
[1:27:51] military school years ago
[1:27:55] one of the things they taught us when I
[1:27:58] came to that particular
[1:28:00] school they said I want you to
[1:28:05] understand here to get the cream of the
[1:28:07] cream of the
[1:28:10] crop we're going to keep
[1:28:14] sifting testing
[1:28:17] you to make
[1:28:19] it you're going to fail
[1:28:24] you understand me this is how God
[1:28:28] works many are
[1:28:31] called but few are
[1:28:33] chosen hallelujah hallelujah but one
[1:28:37] thing we don't have to
[1:28:39] fear we have the see see Gene of
[1:28:44] God on the
[1:28:48] inside that in
[1:28:51] itself ties to us to God
[1:28:55] it binds us to
[1:28:57] God with such a
[1:29:01] bind it cannot be
[1:29:04] broken hallelujah hallelujah look at all
[1:29:08] the
[1:29:10] Patriots of the Old
[1:29:13] Testament Mighty Men of
[1:29:16] God but they were very
[1:29:19] faulty Hallelujah the Bible said we all
[1:29:23] sin
[1:29:25] and we've all come short of the glory of
[1:29:28] God it doesn't
[1:29:30] matter we we looked at a man called
[1:29:35] Joseph and we we we look at all that he
[1:29:39] did and we wonder how did he do
[1:29:43] it not by power not by might but by my
[1:29:48] spirit said the
[1:29:49] Lord it was God's Sovereign Grace
[1:29:55] that he gave to
[1:29:57] Joseph to do his Sovereign
[1:30:01] will understand it is a supernatural
[1:30:05] power that intervene into our
[1:30:09] lives that makes us do the will of
[1:30:14] God that's why no
[1:30:18] man will be able to boast in the
[1:30:22] presence of the Lord HJ Hallelujah even
[1:30:25] when brother Bram said like this he said
[1:30:28] if you see me over there Hallelujah he
[1:30:31] said you might ask me how I make it he
[1:30:36] said I will tell you it's amazing
[1:30:40] gra hallelujah hallelujah we're getting
[1:30:43] ready to
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:46] embrace and you must know the scripture
[1:30:49] says evil
[1:30:52] seducers get worse
[1:30:54] worse Hallelujah come on somebody you
[1:30:58] know and I know it doesn't matter what
[1:31:02] country you're living
[1:31:04] in politicians are
[1:31:07] corrupt and they're not going to get
[1:31:10] better because the scripture says they
[1:31:13] cannot oh y'all getting quiet on me I'm
[1:31:17] trying to bring something to
[1:31:19] you now we
[1:31:21] understand the purpose of God
[1:31:25] one of them
[1:31:27] anyway is to release
[1:31:31] Lucifer on Earth that was no
[1:31:35] mistake you understand me this had
[1:31:38] already been in the mind of
[1:31:41] God where the Battleground would be on
[1:31:45] earth Hallelujah and as I said there in
[1:31:49] Iowa City if you defeated him in the
[1:31:51] beginning
[1:31:55] you defeat him
[1:31:59] now you and I must
[1:32:02] understand that this will not be the
[1:32:04] first
[1:32:06] time Satan gets a
[1:32:11] weapon hallelujah hallelujah this
[1:32:14] message came to make you
[1:32:18] remember and recognize who you
[1:32:22] are Hallelujah Hallelujah if you can say
[1:32:26] it like this we are a
[1:32:28] chip off of the
[1:32:31] rock rock I said
[1:32:34] Rock and Upon This
[1:32:37] Rock he said I build my
[1:32:41] church The
[1:32:43] revelation of Jesus Christ let me tell
[1:32:47] you something it's not that in itself
[1:32:50] will not
[1:32:52] satisfy you can not
[1:32:54] see that Jesus Christ is in
[1:32:58] you because you are now the
[1:33:05] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah now the
[1:33:08] devil got children so does
[1:33:11] Jesus you understand me Hallelujah the
[1:33:14] Bible says according to Second Timothy 2
[1:33:19] 21:19
[1:33:21] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:33:24] standeth
[1:33:26] sure having this
[1:33:29] seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[1:33:32] he and let everyone that nameth the name
[1:33:36] of Christ amen depart from
[1:33:49] iniquity so understand we're not dealing
[1:33:53] with two
[1:33:55] seeds of God one is of God one is of the
[1:34:01] devil one seed is of light and one seed
[1:34:05] is of the
[1:34:06] darkness Hallelujah can I say it like
[1:34:09] this I heard a brother said just not
[1:34:12] long ago even today he said we are now
[1:34:16] living in the age of
[1:34:20] hell I never thought of it like that
[1:34:24] all I thought about was the bride
[1:34:27] age but you're living in one or the
[1:34:31] other Hallelujah y'all better hear what
[1:34:34] I'm saying because even the prophet of
[1:34:37] God told us that hell was blending into
[1:34:44] Earth and what we are
[1:34:46] seeing with these weird looking people
[1:34:53] acting in such a devilish
[1:34:57] way we're now seeing
[1:35:00] demons that was was once in

[3:57:15] you can always be
[3:57:19] excused amen amen when it comes to
[3:57:23] communion it is a time of
[3:57:26] judgment or rather it's a time that we
[3:57:28] judge
[3:57:31] ourselves and when it comes down to
[3:57:33] being
[3:57:36] worthy we're only worthy because he
[3:57:38] makes us
[3:57:41] worthy but in this time is a time that
[3:57:43] we make make things right with
[3:57:48] God or
[3:57:50] sister because we never want to take
[3:57:52] communion
[3:57:54] unworthily you take it

[3:58:01] yourself and I don't know what's in your

[3:58:06] knows and so do
[3:58:09] you with that being said let us
[3:58:13] stand we're going to have a reading from
[3:58:15] First
[3:58:21] Corinthians we'll start with the 23rd
[3:58:29] verse here Paul says for I have received
[3:58:31] of the
[3:58:32] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[3:58:37] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[3:58:40] in which he was betrayed took bread go
[3:58:50] and when he had given thanks he break it
[3:58:53] and said take eat this is my body which
[3:58:56] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[3:58:59] of
[3:59:05] me after the same manner also he took
[3:59:08] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[3:59:12] is the New Testament in my blood
[3:59:15] this do e as often as you drink it in
[3:59:17] remembrance of
[3:59:25] me for as often as you eat this bread
[3:59:29] and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[3:59:32] death till he
[3:59:38] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[3:59:41] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[3:59:44] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[3:59:46] and blood of the
[3:59:53] Lord but let a man examine himself and
[3:59:57] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[3:59:59] of that
[4:00:04] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[4:00:07] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[4:00:09] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[4:00:12] body
[4:00:17] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[4:00:20] among you and many
[4:00:28] sleep for you would judge ourselves if
[4:00:31] we would judge ourselves we should not
[4:00:34] be
[4:00:38] judged but when we are judged we are
[4:00:41] chasen of the Lord and uh uh me that we
[4:00:45] should not be condemned with the
[4:00:53] world wherefore my brethren when you
[4:00:56] come together to eat t one for
[4:01:03] another and if any man hunger let him
[4:01:06] eat at home that you come not together
[4:01:09] unto
[4:01:11] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[4:01:14] order when I
[4:01:24] come amen amen because there are so many
[4:01:29] we're going to have to
[4:01:53] you may be
[4:01:56] seated so what we're going to
[4:01:59] do with the bread we're going to pray
[4:02:02] and break the
[4:02:03] bread and then we'll pass the
[4:02:07] bread but then when it comes to the
[4:02:11] wine we'll form a line

[4:04:01] represents and as we break this
[4:04:04] bread each individual will become a part
[4:04:07] of this
