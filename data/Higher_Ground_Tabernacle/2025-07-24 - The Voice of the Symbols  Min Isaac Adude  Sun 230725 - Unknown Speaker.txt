Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Build your hopes on things eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Things that will stay forever, not things that will be here today and tomorrow that disappear. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you build your hopes on money and houses, cars, and all the things, today you might have it, but tomorrow you might lose it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is the only person, &gt;&gt; the solid rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where we have to build our hopes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We uh greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus. We are so happy to be here u this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. And without taking too much time, let's turn our Bibles to the book of Numbers. We'll read from uh chapter numbers chapter 12 read from verse 6 to verse 8. Yes. &gt;&gt; Numbers 12 verse 6 to verse 8. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the Bible says here, &gt;&gt; be ready. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Hear now, hear now my words. If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream. [Music] My servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house. &gt;&gt; With him will I speak mouthto mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches. And the uh similitude of the Lord shall be shall he behold. Amen. So if you notice here verse six the Bible God here is talking it says that if there is a prophet I the Lord myself will make myself known unto him through dreams and visions. [Music] But when it comes to Moses, Amen, it's something different because I will speak with him mouth to mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. It won't be just visions and dreams. It will be a personal contact. Amen. From my mouth, my mouth and then he will hear straight from his ears. Amen. Let's uh let's turn to Revelation 5 6-7. Amen. Tonight we will try to teach a little bit for few minutes here. Amen. And uh we'll see where the Lord will lead us and I know that the time is already gone. It's almost 8 and will not stay here forever. All right. Revelation 5 verse 6-7. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh let's just start from verse one. &gt;&gt; Just to get a context. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here John says here, "And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the the backside sealed with seven seals." And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. Amen. I And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book. neither to look thereon. And verse five, and one of the elders says, saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to lose the seven seals thereof. And not beheld. And low in the midst of the throne, and of the four beast, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as he had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Father God, we come to you, Lord. Lord Jesus, with all our faults, Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, all our burdens and everything, Father, just as we are, &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray, Father God, that uh you cleanse us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you forgive our sins, oh God. Lord, that you forgive our iniquities, oh Lord. Lord Jesus, the word that we just read, oh Father, Lord, we pray, Father God, that you come and you bring the revelation to us, Lord, it doesn't matter how long I've spent studying this word, but if you don't bring this word to your feet, Lord, all the sacrifices will be meaningless. Lord, we ask you father to take the preeminence to help me to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit to say only what you want me to say, Father. Lord bless every hearts in this place Lord in Jesus Christ name we say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight uh the subject will be the voice of the symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. The voice of the symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh as as as a uh as a foundation before I get to before I get straight to my teaching. Amen. In the Old Testament or whenever there is no prophet when God needs to speak to someone through a dream or or a vision. Amen. Brother Brennham says that the message is clear when there is no prophet in the land. Amen. God does not speak through symbols. Amen. Look at Joseph. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God was telling to when God showed gave the vision or the dream to Joseph, &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a clear vision. &gt;&gt; Joseph, take Mary as for your wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. When when God showed the vision or the dream to the magi, [Music] Amen. It was a clear dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do not return to Herod. Amen. Because there were no prophets in in the land. It meant nobody was there to explain. So God had to speak clearly. Amen. But when there is a prophet in the land, amen, the word of God according to MS3, &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that the word comes through the prophet first. Amen. So God will have to reveal his word to the prophet. So when you see dreams that happen when the prophet is in the land, those people they see symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. They don't understand the voice of it. Amen. They don't understand the meaning of it. Amen. They only see symbols. Amen. But God will have to reveal those symbols to a prophet. And the prophet will have to bring you the voice of those symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible is full of symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you look at you study the the book of Genesis, &gt;&gt; Amen. when Moses was writing about when Moses was writing in Genesis chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Amen. Genesis chapter 3 verse 23 I believe. Amen. Uh when Moses was writing this Amen. Moses was writing the symbols that he was seeing in the vision because notice that Moses was not there when the world or when the earth was created. Amen. Moses was not there when when when when God when Adam and Eve was there. Amen. So when Moses started writing Amen. Moses was riding at what he saw. Amen. He saw a tree of life. &gt;&gt; And Moses said there was a tree of life in the middle of the garden. Eve or the the serpent giving the fruit to Eve. Amen. Moses wrote the fruits. Amen. But the the meaning of it, &gt;&gt; Amen. was hidden, Amen. until God appointed a time for that revelation. &gt;&gt; So when brother Brandham came, Amen, he started explaining to us, Amen, what Moses wrote, Amen, the voice behind those symbols, Amen, telling us that the tree of life, Amen, is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the fruit, Amen, was not an apple. Amen. And and the tree of good and evil, Amen. was not a mango or something that we said that that tree was a woman. Amen. So the book if the Bible is full of symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. when uh the king uh uh in Daniel uh Nebuchadnezzar had a dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. His second dream &gt;&gt; in Daniel chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a tree going up to the heavens. Amen. But he did not understand what those symbols meant. So he had to inquire. Amen. people who were able to interpret what he saw. The Bibles in Daniel chapter 4 tells us that he calls he called his magicians. &gt;&gt; Amen. He called the sorcerers. &gt;&gt; Amen. He called those wise people and none of them were able to explain to the king what he saw. Even though the king gave them the symbols, But the king had to go ask for Daniel to come because Daniel was the prophet and the word could only come to the prophets. But when Daniel came and started explaining to him and he explained to him what the dream was. Amen. For the sake of time we're not going to go in detail on that. Amen. But you can find it in Daniel chapter 4. But when it comes to in Daniel chapter 2, the king had another dream. But this time, the king himself could not remember his dream. Amen. The king had a dream. Amen. But for some reason, he forgot about it. And I believe that God doesn't do things just for the sake of doing it. That dream was a type of the seventh seal. Amen. A silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the king saw a dream. Amen. But he could not explain. He could not remember the dream. So he asked people to tell him what he dreamed of. Amen. He called the magicians. &gt;&gt; Amen. He called the sorcerers. Amen. And nobody could tell him. Amen. All of them were saying, "But king, you have to tell us a little bit of what you saw. Give us an idea of what you saw." &gt;&gt; Amen. But the king said, "I don't have I don't know it with it. I I can't remember." And the king was so frustrated. And he decided he said he had a decree to kill all those people, the wise men. But when they went to talk to Daniel, Amen. Daniel when he came, Amen. Daniel did not ask the king what he saw. Amen. But Daniel told the king, Amen. Give me time. Amen. To go and pray God. Amen. to go and ask God because he is the one who reveals grace. So he took with him Shadrach, Meshach and Abedne, he went and prayed. Amen. And when Daniel started explaining the dream, first he started telling the king what he saw. Amen. He started telling the king the symbols that he saw. Amen. Of a statue. &gt;&gt; Amen. Having different material built with different materials. &gt;&gt; The head was different than the than the feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a stone came and and broke it. Amen. So Daniel started telling the king the symbols that he saw. after the symbols. He gave the king the voice of those symbols. &gt;&gt; In other words, he gave the king the revelation of the meaning of what he saw. Amen. So that that was the case in the Old Testament. Amen. You have the same thing with Joseph when he was in prison. I believe in Genesis chapter 40. Amen. Those two prisoners, they had dreams. &gt;&gt; Amen. And their dreams were full of symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. And only Joseph was there was able to interpret what those dreams, what those symbols were. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so is the book of Revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. The book of Revelation &gt;&gt; is a book of symbols. Amen. You can take this book &gt;&gt; and spend 500 years reading it every day. You will you will never be able to understand it. Amen. You will think that you have understood. Amen. But you know, you do you don't understand. You won't be able to understand it. Amen. It's like today I saw a brother posting something. Amen. A preacher was preaching is not a message believer. Amen. He was preaching about Revelation 10 1-7. [Music] And it says that it says that the the the angel that the Bible is talking about. Amen. Had one foot on the sea &gt;&gt; to control the sea &gt;&gt; and one foot on the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. The brother turned to this church &gt;&gt; and he says that that that that that angel was an animal. It wasn't it was a hippo. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the deacon that were behind the pulpit all of them saying amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that when God asked Jo, he said that God asked Job &gt;&gt; what was my first creation? Job said, "I don't know." And God told He said that God told Job, he was a hippo. &gt;&gt; Amen. And people said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You see that the Bible is full of symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without a prophet, &gt;&gt; Amen. you will be lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without a prophet, &gt;&gt; and everybody will have their own interpretation. of what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go to school and study about it. Amen. But you will never have the revelation. Amen. Unless that revelation comes from a prophet. Amen. You say, "Well, what do you mean?" Amen. Let's go to uh uh uh Revelation chapter 10. this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation chapter 10 or before we go there, let's uh read u something here. All right, that's fine. Let's let's go to um uh Revelation chapter 10 verse 1-7 here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here the Bible says, "And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, &gt;&gt; and a rainbow was upon his head. And his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when the lion roared. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. &gt;&gt; And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write it. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, &gt;&gt; and write them not." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven. And swear by him that liveth forever and ever. Who created heaven and the things that therein, and the earth and things that therein are, and the sea and the thing therein are. that there should be time no longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now let's pay attention to this. &gt;&gt; Amen. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; when he shall begin the sound, the mystery of God shall be finished as he has declared to his servants, the prophets. Amen. So when the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; amen, will be sounding, &gt;&gt; amen, all the mysteries of God will be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in other words, there will be no other or angel, amen, coming after this one. Amen. To reveal the mysteries. First of all, because there will be no mysteries to be revealed. Amen. Some people say that I said there are some some some stuff that are not revealed in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Well, the question is who will come? &gt;&gt; Amen. I was reading and someone say, "Brother Joseph, well, I don't know what you mean." &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible tells me Amen. That when that seventh angel, amen, shall begin to sound, amen, the mystery of God will be revealed. Amen. So there will be no other prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a prophet, &gt;&gt; amen, is also an angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this revelation chapter 10 is 1 to 7. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you understand is divided in three parts. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first part is Revelation 10 1-4. Amen. Those that talks about the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Revelation chapter 10 1-4 is talking about three mysteries. &gt;&gt; The first mystery, &gt;&gt; Amen. is the mystery of the mighty of the mighty angel. Amen. Who's coming down from heaven? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the second mystery, Amen. is the mystery of the little book open. Amen. And the and and the third mystery. Amen. Is the mystery of the seven thunders. Amen. That utter their voices. That is the first part of that verse of that of that that part that portion. Amen. And the second part of it, &gt;&gt; Amen. is the declaration. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the verse five to verse six. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saying that, showing what what that angel will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. What who is that angel and and his position? &gt;&gt; Amen. And this the third part, &gt;&gt; Amen. is talking about the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the seventh angel &gt;&gt; is not that mighty angel is different than to the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh angel, &gt;&gt; Amen. is a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of the of the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the mighty angel, &gt;&gt; Amen. is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is coming down from the heaven. Amen. clothed with with the cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So to go back a little bit here. &gt;&gt; So we have to understand &gt;&gt; that when God speaks only the prophet can understand it. &gt;&gt; Only the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham. Uh if we read uh the message the spiritual food in due season [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 116 paragraph &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet here is telling the an events that happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. Was preached in 65 uh uh July 18th in the evening. Amen. So, paragraph 116, the prophet says and I started I started to walk around. &gt;&gt; Then I heard the voice of God speak said, "Get out of the way quickly. Roy Robertson standing there knowing he was a veteran of the waret. I put my hand on his shoulder and I said, "Brother Roy, hide as quick as you can." Then he said, "What's the matter?" &gt;&gt; I said, "Get out of the way. Hide." Amen. So now noticed and just as and just started walking around, &gt;&gt; put my shovel down, &gt;&gt; turned around, &gt;&gt; took off my hat. Amen. Because he knew that the Lord was about to speak when the Lord is about to speak. Amen. You have to show respect. Amen. That's why God told Moses, "Take off your shoes because you're standing on holy ground." That's why he told Joshua, "Take off your shoes because you're standing on holy ground." A sign of respect. So he took off his hat and here he come. Glory of God falling in a whirlwind. Amen. &gt;&gt; That tore the side of the mountain out like that &gt;&gt; and blasted and shook the place like that. Amen. Cut the top of the bushes out just about three or four or five feet above my head. went back up like a funnel like that and blasted again. And here I come three times. Amen. Then when I when he left time, &gt;&gt; brother Banks come over said that's what you was talking about. &gt;&gt; I said yes. Said what was it? He asked what was it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice here both of them felt what happened. Amen. They felt the power of God. Only the prophet was able to hear the voice. Amen. Behind. Amen. The symbols that happened. Amen. If brother if if that brother came back amen. and you ask him what happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is he going to tell you? &gt;&gt; Amen. He will tell you that the mountain, the top of the mountain was cut off, the bushes was cut off. Amen. He will only tell you the symbols. Amen. That he was able to see. But he will not be able to tell you the message that was hiding behind all of that. So only the prophet Amen who is able to tell you the voice of what happened. So he asked the prophet said what was it? I said God appears in whirlwinds. I didn't know whether he wanted me to tell the people or not. Then I went on and prayed a little bit. Then he told me I could tell him. &gt;&gt; I said judgment striking the west coast. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the voice of those symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those that voice was amen. The judgment &gt;&gt; striking the west coast. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at her today. Look what happened a few hours ago. Alaska sunk &gt;&gt; and now the whole thing is going under. We entering into the judgment. Mercy has been spawned. Amen. So without the prophet Amen there will be no interpretation of the word. There will be confusion. People bringing their own revelations, people bringing their own thoughts trying to explain. &gt;&gt; Amen. What's going on, Amen. But the prophet, &gt;&gt; Amen. receives the message from God. Amen. The same way God told Moses, God told Miriam and Aaron, I speak through prophets. I speak to prophets. Amen. Through visions and dreams. Amen. But Moses, &gt;&gt; Amen. I speak to him mouth to mouth. Amen. And I believe, Amen. that in this last age, Amen. The seventh message. Amen. God did not only speak to him through visions and dreams. He spoke to him mouth to mouth. God appeared to him. Amen. But Moses could not see. Moses wanted to see the face of God. They made him saw made him see his back. But in this last age, Amen. God was kind enough. Amen. To let us see his face. Amen. He saw us his face. That's when when brother Brandham saw this picture for the first time, he said that this is the closest picture of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? &gt;&gt; Because he was able to compare it. Amen. To something he saw. Amen. Not just something that he heard. He saw the face of it. Amen. when he saw this picture, he said that this is the closest that he has sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to u uh steal the the the the spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Now in paragraph 84, &gt;&gt; Amen. You will see that even things that we do take for granted. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even like the cloud. Amen. If the prophet was not there, nobody will be able to understand what it was. Amen. In paragraph 84 of the second season, Amen. Paragraph 84, brother. &gt;&gt; Then when that went up, &gt;&gt; Amen. talking about the cloud that 63. Amen. The big observ observatories &gt;&gt; from way down in California &gt;&gt; plumbed down in Mexico &gt;&gt; over Texan everywhere taking the picture of it. It was a mysterious sight. Brother Fred Sman there &gt;&gt; sitting right back there and I and brother Gin Norman &gt;&gt; standing right there present when it went up they took the picture. Amen. Still they don't know what about it. [Music] Amen. They saw something strange. Amen. They saw something unnormal. Amen. And they took a picture of it. Amen. But they don't know what about it. Amen. Here some time ago. Everybody's saying, "Look here." Amen. This looks like this. Amen. And them angels wings and how they're folded in there. So now one day turning it to the right. Amen. Looking &gt;&gt; there was Jesus Christ just as perfect as of men as of man ever drawn him. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was standing there with a white wig on [Music] Amen. Looking back down towards the earth. Amen. Showing that he is the supreme authority. Amen. The heavens declares it. Declare it. The Bible declares it. The message declares it. All the same. Amen. Supreme authority. Amen. With the white wig on. You see his black beard under he started showing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the message u uh um uh u um I forgot the um uh uh this scripture is fulfilled I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. It might be there or somewhere else. Amen. You see that brother Brennham is able to point Amen. Pointing the eyes. Amen. Pointing the nose. Amen. Pointing the mouth. Amen. He's even saying that those the white clouds that was surrounding him, Amen. were seven angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was able to point the seventh angel. Amen. And he says that the the angel that made that that caught his attention. Amen. It was that seventh angel. Amen. You see, nobody understood what it was. Amen. Nobody had an idea. Amen. But only the prophet. Amen. Had to receive the revelation from God. Amen. And the prophet will come and explain it to us. It says that we got it back there. Just turn it to the right. Amen. First of all, they were looking it all wrong. Amen. They were looking it all wrong. Amen. When you look at it all wrong. Amen. You can't see the right picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like the brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. They went to hunt. And the other brother was looking through the scope. Amen. And he sees three animals or three I don't remember the numbers. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was looking at all wrong. But when brother came, he was able to adjust the scope. Amen. And he was able to see only the one hand. So you need the prophet on earth, to be able to explain to you, what those symbols are. &gt;&gt; Amen. There he is. just as perfect as he was. &gt;&gt; It had been photographed of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're looking at they're looking at it from the wrong angle. &gt;&gt; You got to look at it in the right angle. Amen. And only the Lord can reveal which is the right angle. Amen. Only the Lord can reveal which is the right angle. Amen. And when the Lord decide to reveal the right come to brother Isaac, Amen. to reveal it to him because I am not a prophet. Amen. But he will go to the major prophet. He is the messenger of the age. He will go to him and he will reveal the right hand to him and then he will come to me. Brother Isaac, you were looking at this wrong to the right. Amen. And you will see that it is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Only the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There he is. just as perfect &gt;&gt; if it had been photographed up there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there is nobody else coming to reveal. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no one. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet is gone. &gt;&gt; Which means that all the mysteries, all the mysteries in the Bible, Amen. Every single one of them, &gt;&gt; Amen. have been revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. including the seven thunders. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. The trumpets. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all those mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. All of them have been revealed. Amen. So if you don't have the understanding or the revelation, pray and ask God. Amen. To grant it to you. Amen. Because you can read what the prophet is saying. Amen. But you still can be blinded by it. Amen. Because says the word of God is like a puzzle. Amen. God will put a piece here. Amen. He'll put another piece there. Amen. He'll put another piece here. Amen. So when you're reading it, without the revelation, you won't be able to connect those pieces up. to make a perfect picture. Amen. Your picture will be wrong. Amen. So, you need the revelation. Even when you're reading the message, you still need the revelation. That's why says the revelation is a great thing that God can give to a believer. Amen. Because his own church, he's not built upon Jesus Christ. Amen. His own church. Amen. He's built. Amen. Upon the revelation, Amen. of who Jesus Christ is. Amen. So the revelation, Amen. is a great thing that God can give to you. Amen. So only God can give you the revelation. The prophet goes as far to say that even faith is a revelation. Amen. The faith that Abraham had Abraham did not take him by by himself. Amen. But that faith was given to him by God. Was revealed to him by God to endure those 25 years of waiting for Isaac. Amen. Even faith is a revelation. So without a revelation, you won't be able to go anywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message, the bridge between the seven seals, the seven church ages and the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 40. Brother Brandham says here &gt;&gt; now you see &gt;&gt; I'm just not making that up. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not making it up. &gt;&gt; It's death is thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will read it to you out of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. The sounding of the seventh angel's message, the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets. That's the prophet who has wrote the B the word. Amen. And at the sounding, the seventh church age, &gt;&gt; the last church age, &gt;&gt; all the loose ends, the through these church ages has been probed at. Amen. We'll be wind up together. Amen. So when the seventh angel is gone, &gt;&gt; the seventh messenger is gone, &gt;&gt; there will be no loose end. Amen. Because when you understand the mystery of the the the the the u &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham's uh uh uh mission, the mission of Amen. You will see that he has two parts. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first part was restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. But because before God reveals the word, Amen, he has to make sure the foundation is solid. Amen. Because if the foundation is not solid, Amen. It will bring more trouble, more confusion. Amen. So the first part of his of his ministry, Amen, was the restoration. Amen. The same way Elijah has to restore, Amen. the ark. Amen. So did Elasha had to restore. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the altar. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So is Malachi 4. Amen. William Brham. Amen. Has also to restore the altar. The altar. Amen. That's why he preached about marriage and divorce. That's why he preached about the serpent seed. That's why he preached about the baptism of the Holy That's why he preached about baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus everything that the devil took away from and after the restoration is done then God will come and reveal amen those mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen to the church. Amen. So that's been declared by his holy prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a prophet who has wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh church age. The last church age all the loose ends. Now through these church ages had been probed at war wind up together and then the seals are broken. Amen. So before the seals be broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. All everything has to be wind up together. No loose ends. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when and and when the seals are broken, the mystery is revealed. Down comes the angel. The messenger Christ sitting his foot upon the land and upon the sea &gt;&gt; with a rainbow over his head. Now remember, this seventh angel is on earth. Amen. The seventh angel. Amen. That's that's Revelation 10 10:7. &gt;&gt; Amen. This seventh angel, &gt;&gt; amen, is on earth at the time of his coming. Amen. Just as John was giving his message, the same time that Messiah come in the days. Amen. John knew he would see him. Amen. Because he was going to introduce him. &gt;&gt; And we realize that in the scriptures &gt;&gt; over in Malachi chapter 4. Amen. There is to be one like John. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Elijah &gt;&gt; to whom the word of God can come to and he is to reveal. Amen. Not only his own interpretation, not only something that he will come and make or make not a made up thought. Amen. But he will reveal by the Holy Spirit. Amen. All the mysteries of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Will reveal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Will talk to the prophets. Prophets. Amen. Will reveal all the mysteries of God. The prophet here did not say some of the mysteries. Amen. If you read the message, the trumpets, Amen. The prophet says, &gt;&gt; Amen. that the seventh angel, seventh messenger, will reveal all the mysteries of God. Amen. All the mysteries of God. Amen. Every mysteries that the Bible is talking about whether be translation whether be the second coming. Amen. All those mysteries, Amen. are supposed to be revealed. Amen. But the seventh messenger, Amen. The mysteries of God and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the apostles. Amen. Restore back all these mysteries that proved it. through these denominational years. Now that's what the word said. &gt;&gt; I am just responsible for what is said. &gt;&gt; In other words, I cannot add or I cannot take away. Amen. I am just responsible for what the word said. Everything the word said that is what I have brought to you. Amen. Nothing more nothing less. Amen. It's written. Amen. Is right. Amen. That's what it is. Now we see that this seven seal book is the mystery of redemption. &gt;&gt; It's a book of redemption from God. Now all the mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this message. Amen. So people today they're fuss about if the seventh seal has been remove because it was a moment of of silence. Amen. If you read the message the seventh seal the prophet himself at the end. Amen. He was wondering if the me if that was revealed or not. Amen. But here it says that all the mysteries &gt;&gt; Amen. including that seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is the angel on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Verse 45, he said, "And now all the mysteries at this time shall be finished at the sounding of this messenger." Amen. Now &gt;&gt; here is the angel on earth &gt;&gt; and another angel &gt;&gt; mighty messenger &gt;&gt; come down. &gt;&gt; See this angel &gt;&gt; was an earthly angel messenger. Amen. But here comes one down from heaven. A rainbow covenant. If only Christ &gt;&gt; it could be. &gt;&gt; Amen. No other no man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No other person. &gt;&gt; But only Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. That could be. Amen. So when John saw it, John heard the seven thunders. When John was about to write it. Amen. But he heard a voice that told him, "Do not write a John. Amen. do not reveal this. Amen. This is preserved. Amen. To that seventh messenger. Amen. So John when he was writing the book of the of the revelation when he was writing the book of the of the seventh seal. Amen. John could only write what he saw. Amen. Remember in Revelation chapter 6. Amen. Verse one. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says here, &gt;&gt; "And I saw when the when the lamb open one of the seals, &gt;&gt; and I heard as he were the noise of thunder." &gt;&gt; No, you jumped verse verse one. And I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals, &gt;&gt; and I heard as he were the noise of the thunder of thunder. Oh, sorry. One of the four beasts saying, "Come and see." Amen. John heard the voice. Amen. Of a of thunder. Amen. Then &gt;&gt; one of the one of the beasts, one of the four beasts, &gt;&gt; amen, told him to come and see. &gt;&gt; So John did both. He saw &gt;&gt; and he heard, but was only allowed to ride what he saw. Amen. And what did John see? Amen. John saw the the horse rider. That was what John saw. And that's what he wrote. Amen. And I saw, and behold, a white horse. &gt;&gt; And he that sat on it had a bow, &gt;&gt; and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and and to conquer. Amen. So John heard, heard the thunder. And now what is a thunder? A thunder is a voice of God. Amen. A thunder is a voice of God. When God was giving the laws to Moses, Amen. Moses was receiving the ten commandments. When God was speaking the first commandment, I am the Lord thy God. When Moses heard, I am the Lord thy God. But the people who were stubborn because they didn't want to hear from Moses. Amen. But they wanted to take the place of the prophet. &gt;&gt; When Moses brought them to that mountain, everything they could hear. Amen. Was thunders lightnings loud trumpets. They couldn't understand what it was. So only Moses was able to hear Amen. The voice. Amen. All the symbols. Amen. Was able to hear. Amen. I understand what those thunders were. Amen. Was the voice of God. Amen. God speaking, "Amen." In John chapter 12, I believe verse 33. Amen. When Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "Amen, now it's time to glorify." It said that glorify my uh I don't I don't have it memorized. Let me let me read it for you. John 12:23. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that and and Jesus answered them saying, "The hour has come. &gt;&gt; The son of man should be glorified." &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we jump, &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 27, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Save me from this hour. For this cause came I unto this hour. &gt;&gt; Father glorify thy name. Then came father glor father glorify thy name. Then came a voice from heaven saying, "I have both glorified &gt;&gt; and will glorified." Amen. That is what the voice from heaven said. But the people that were with Jesus, the people that stood by and heard it, they said it thundered. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when Jesus heard it, I was as clear as day. &gt;&gt; Father glorify glorified glorified &gt;&gt; and I'll glorify it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a thunder, Amen. is nothing but the voice of God. Amen. So when John saw &gt;&gt; when John heard a thunder, &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the the the elders the one of the elders told him to come see &gt;&gt; and what he saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw symbols. &gt;&gt; That's why John wrote symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seven seals. Amen. John only wrote what he saw. Amen. When Daniel heard the seven thunders and he wanted to write it down, the angel told him not to write because this was revealed. Because this had to be revealed at this time. Amen. For you and me. Amen. To give us the rapturing face. Amen. To bring the bride closer to him. This did not come to bring confusion. Amen. But he came to bring us closer to him. Amen. I think time is way past. Amen. I wasn't able to teach what I wanted. I preaching. I hope everything was clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Next time we will start now on the the seven seals. Amen. Starting from the first explaining the voice of those symbols. &gt;&gt; Amen. What John saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first horse rider. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the prophet was was revealing. Amen. He says that that's Antichrist. Amen. That's the first the first horse rider. Amen. Was a white horse. Amen. to be confused with the white horse from Revelation 19 [Music] because people think that's Christ in in Revelation chapter 6. Amen. But that is not Christ. Amen. Christ is a white horse in Revelation 191. Amen. You will say that he has no name. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has no name. &gt;&gt; He has he has no name. He has been given a crown. Amen. That he couldn't wear. Amen. He has a He has a He has an arc. Amen. But he doesn't have the bow flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. All of these were symbols. &gt;&gt; And those symbols, &gt;&gt; they mean something. &gt;&gt; They have a meaning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God just did not God God does not write things just like that. Amen. All of these have meanings. Amen. Because of time, we won't be able to go through all of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh uh let me read one last quote and then uh we'll close with this. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the first seal, &gt;&gt; paragraph 146, prophet says to you. &gt;&gt; I wanted to explain what uh why John wept. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh Amen. These are these are some good stuff. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's hard to stop. Amen. When I was uh studying this all night, I was studying this. &gt;&gt; Amen. I stayed up all night. I did not even sleep. Amen. And when I went to work and now all the tiredness started out hitting but when I was studying this, it was able to keep me up. Amen. Because this brings this brings Amen. Amen. It's it's the wine and the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. It brings stimulation. Amen. When you hear the word of God revealed to you, Amen. It brings stimulation. Amen. It makes you want to shout. It makes you want to dance. &gt;&gt; Amen. He makes you want to say hallelujah and praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. And by the grace of God, we're just going to stop here. &gt;&gt; And if God's will next time, we'll go through it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Senior Roger. I don't know how his schedule is, but Friday. [Music] &gt;&gt; That was good message. That was good. And I enjoyed every bit of it. If you enjoyed that, something's wrong with you. Amen. It ought to solidify your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we have an understanding of of what's happening today. &gt;&gt; And so we're not in the dark. We're children of light. So grateful for Amen. So we just want to thank the Lord for the sacrifice of our brother. I called I text him at the last minute. I said, "I'm so tired. Can somebody speak for me today? I appreciate the sacrifice.
