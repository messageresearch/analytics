[6:55] [Music]
[7:03] [Music]
[7:17] we've received the message
[7:29] insanity
[7:31] [Music]
[7:41] we had no idea what
[7:42] [Music]
[7:48] in school trying to find out where we
[7:54] belong in this world
[7:57] [Music]
[8:01] but in all of that we realize that these
[8:08] things are great and to be able to
[8:11] establish yourself in a way where you
[8:13] don't have to struggle it's like
[8:17] now trust and pushed in all of us
[8:20] like that with God makes some of us some
[8:26] of us have it easier than others but by
[8:29] God's grace we affirmed and we're now
[8:31] finding our place in this world
[8:35] when we think about purpose and that's
[8:37] the subject this morning one purpose
[8:41] purpose is the reason for which someone
[8:44] exists or is done may
[8:50] [Music]
[8:52] everybody
[8:58] have a little ceremony
[9:01] Wow
[9:03] I live with her
[9:05] one year old
[9:09] the dogma graduate there
[9:12] all day
[9:16] giving
[9:18] [Music]
[9:26] but be sometime
[9:29] [Music]
[9:32] I am calling
[9:37] if we go back to the book of Genesis we
[9:39] find that in Genesis first chapter
[9:48] [Music]
[9:55] Trading all these me but it's made
[10:00] [Music]
[10:01] [Applause]
[10:05] we heard this before because
[10:10] treated all these days
[10:13] it's like
[10:16] [Music]
[10:18] god forbid
[10:21] [Applause]
[10:23] [Music]
[10:26] we saw out of a doll or the reflection
[10:29] of the Living God
[10:31] Oh
[10:35] was it me God he was a god aided by the
[10:39] bother that oh god was invisible we
[10:43] could still find the way out of the egg
[10:45] his accent
[10:47] [Music]
[10:48] what God was like God was at the ADA
[10:57] we plenty of degree
[11:01] of course out of film
[11:04] my way of the purpose so they need
[11:08] after that ball we know
[11:12] but it's insane if I said we came into
[11:16] this world and still it shaped and
[11:19] iniquity right
[11:21] and so we bared the nature of Adam no
[11:24] longer the nature of God Adam bared the
[11:26] nature of God but because of the fall we
[11:30] now bear the nature of Adam you and I
[11:34] have been called and elected and all of
[11:36] this is a program all of this is a
[11:38] purpose all of this is a a beautiful
[11:40] thing once we can see what God is doing
[11:43] we understand we were created to be
[11:46] fallen creatures we were made to be in
[11:49] the image and likeness of God you're
[11:52] reflecting something no matter who you
[11:56] are you are a reflection of something
[12:00] you're either reflecting heaven or you
[12:05] reflect
[12:07] our lives are reflections of something
[12:10] somewhere
[12:12] you either reflecting life for you
[12:14] reflecting all right if it's by there's
[12:21] no shadow nothing can make a shadow but
[12:25] if it's mixed with dark in life if late
[12:29] to shout that's why the song is said
[12:33] gave I walk through the family in shadow
[12:36] of the end of Yui because of darkness
[12:41] [Music]
[12:42] and light mix we are what we call a
[12:47] shadow
[12:48] we're reflecting something so we are
[12:51] really shallows of light
[12:54] are we reflecting a life from somewhere
[12:57] and if you are a Christian there being a
[13:01] shadow it's only proved that there is a
[13:05] life where you can't not see in this
[13:09] life we conduct but in the real life and
[13:13] not die because of this life has a death
[13:18] in it is that right
[13:20] the Bible said be aboard and we are
[13:22] pointed to death one right we know that
[13:26] death has been accorded to us because
[13:28] everybody died
[13:30] it doesn't matter if you rich poor
[13:33] beautiful you go down a mess
[13:40] it brings a translation it is important
[13:44] that we understand the purpose of Jesus
[13:46] Christ about that Jesus Christ is the
[13:49] light of the world is that right
[13:53] the box that he is light and the
[13:56] darkness cannot comprehend it
[14:08] [Music]
[14:19] because you're living that's what we
[14:31] call life and that I dislike this this
[14:34] model I miss pure reflection
[14:43] why do needs have all this religious no
[14:47] religious we find religion everywhere
[14:49] but because there's something in the
[14:51] heart of lay makes you know he was not
[14:55] created to die he knows that there is
[14:58] something greater than this life that's
[15:03] why the Bible said if you put all your
[15:04] hope and trust in this life you are
[15:07] above I mean most miserable and if this
[15:11] is it you live in your diet you live in
[15:14] your diet it why do we work so hard to
[15:19] establish and we see things in this life
[15:22] why we got you know what happens with us
[15:25] we
[15:25] have a purpose
[15:28] because without a purpose you go in
[15:30] saying we don't even know what you're
[15:32] here for or what you come for you I
[15:34] don't care if you feel like you were
[15:36] born to be a janitor at least that's a
[15:38] purpose to live
[15:41] but when there is no purpose your mind
[15:44] something's happened to your mind
[15:47] you want not only your friends to know
[15:50] that you have a purpose but your family
[15:51] no should know you have a purpose you
[15:54] come to church because you wanna come to
[15:58] see what your purpose is you might be a
[16:01] lawyer doctor you know successful in
[16:06] this life but there still something that
[16:09] makes you know that you came here with a
[16:12] greater purpose
[16:15] hallelujah your reflection you are our
[16:19] reflection and that there is life and
[16:22] that there is death and when you mix
[16:26] those two together you have a shadow
[16:29] the physical has to die but if you are
[16:33] reflecting by your model life the light
[16:36] of heaven then you're reflecting eternal
[16:40] light that right that's why God said you
[16:43] must be born again
[16:45] cuz when we first came we were children
[16:48] arrived arrived we were reflecting what
[16:51] yeah we live the way they live inhale
[16:57] [Music]
[16:59] then you know we're an expression
[17:02] when a person has been so bad and so
[17:05] evil in beabea are they about some man
[17:07] will come and says Amen talking about
[17:14] and that's not a compliment
[17:18] right oh it was up dollars that's not a
[17:24] compliment because doll and the spine or
[17:28] the peak it maybe is the nastiness
[17:31] mostly unwanted animals that's written
[17:35] in the Bible
[17:40] I guess people think I don't talk about
[17:42] your dog I'm just telling you the name
[17:45] Jehovah naw
[17:51] hallelujah that that just came downtown
[17:55] so you and I must understand so what
[18:01] let me balance that out the duct Bible
[18:04] calls the Gentile Gentile dog you know
[18:08] why because the dog was closer than a
[18:12] brother
[18:15] that right a dog you can rip him who can
[18:19] be them you can stop him and he spilled
[18:21] long the kiss with your face
[18:26] but if you are reflecting by your water
[18:29] life the life of heaven in Europe
[18:31] respecting the eternal life God then
[18:33] when you die you can know how then go to
[18:36] that light because that's what your
[18:39] exact understanding whatever you are
[18:42] respecting when you dock
[18:45] that's where you go if you are
[18:48] reflecting light then you're reflecting
[18:53] that light when you die you go back if
[18:58] you are respecting hell or when you die
[19:04] you go to the dark you go to hear that
[19:08] light becomes a magnet to yourself
[19:10] so the dog
[19:12] [Music]
[19:16] hello I'm coming
[19:19] give your altar dog world you respect
[19:23] this and you can do a bowl no other way
[19:27] but to dock so we are in a reflection so
[19:32] we see that as sure as the Holy Spirit
[19:35] reflects light and life so this depth
[19:38] reflects darkness who somebody help me
[19:42] is you and I must understand our purpose
[19:46] in this world is not to reflect darkness
[19:49] we are not children of the night we are
[19:53] not children of the darkness the verb
[19:55] said we are children of the light and
[19:58] therefore won't be therefore in the
[20:00] light at all right these are problems
[20:06] what are you saying what caused is a man
[20:08] or a woman to walk in darkness is on
[20:13] short word seeing Tina's unbelief
[20:17] smoking gambling drinking carousing is
[20:20] not seeing is the proof of see it is the
[20:24] fruit of our vision hallelujah but
[20:28] seeing his unbelief is that right
[20:32] elleny that committed the first sin what
[20:35] was it unbelief the Bible tells us upon
[20:41] the first dawn he that committeth sin is
[20:43] of the devil for the devil sinneth from
[20:52] the beginning for this purpose the Son
[20:54] of God was manifested that he might
[20:57] destroy the word - what the devil is
[21:00] that right that's why Jesus said if any
[21:03] man believeth in me though he was dead
[21:07] yet shall he live that right so you
[21:12] gotta understand life eternal life come
[21:15] by believing in Jesus Christ always
[21:18] there any other way there's no other way
[21:22] from beginning once real life when no I
[21:26] want was the escape and then the blood
[21:29] there was only one door to the earth you
[21:33] didn't have several doors there was only
[21:35] one door that door was to get in and to
[21:38] come out is that right when it comes a
[21:42] mentor to Christ he said I am the door
[21:45] there are no others own
[21:49] we must understand the purpose where our
[21:52] mom's coming to in just a minute because
[21:54] if we can understand the purpose of
[21:57] Jesus Christ
[21:58] we'll begin to see the purpose for which
[22:00] we were born in the beginning we were to
[22:03] be sons and daughters of God but because
[22:06] of the fall we were born into in
[22:09] iniquity
[22:11] [Music]
[22:18] they were infected both light and dark
[22:21] product of the feel then Jesus come
[22:26] along as you must make the tree God or
[22:28] you must make it evil see you can't make
[22:31] it true the tree good and evil why
[22:33] because the shadow in the and the real
[22:35] product has become one is that right
[22:38] Solomon says in that day that the shadow
[22:42] because what I can't give it to you
[22:59] Hinduism take give a deal no church can
[23:02] give it to you don't reach you can give
[23:04] it to you no bishop not elders no pulp
[23:07] there's only one person that can give
[23:10] you eternal life and that's Jesus Christ
[23:11] Himself hallelujah there are not two
[23:18] source of resources there's only one
[23:21] eternal life that eternal life before he
[23:24] was God he was called Elohim which means
[23:27] self existing wrong so I said well who
[23:31] made God when you figure that out you
[23:34] become God
[23:38] no man knows him ha come on salat it his
[23:43] ways of past finding out God does things
[23:46] that that you and I can't even explain
[23:50] but when you do what he says you and
[23:52] make sense I'm coming to it we are to
[23:56] aid what we call free age this is the
[24:00] age of freedom come out of her my people
[24:04] and be not partakers of her iniquity an
[24:07] age that God breaks the yokes destroys
[24:12] the works of the devil is that right
[24:13] because the mother said that's why Jesus
[24:16] Christ claimed that he might destroy the
[24:18] works of the enemy and you have come
[24:22] that God can work through you to prove
[24:25] that he has destroyed the works of the
[24:27] enemy that's why I testify this morning
[24:31] when the doctor said I had cancer Jesus
[24:34] said no
[24:36] hallelujah come on somebody when the
[24:39] Dodgers try to give up and say all kinds
[24:41] of things Amen Jesus still says no it's
[24:45] not what the doctor says is what Jesus
[24:47] says I thank God for the doctors don't
[24:50] get me wrong
[24:52] hallelujah
[24:56] appreciate our since to further she
[24:58] works in the teeth
[25:00] God can straight my teeth but God
[25:03] brought her here so that she hit cuz she
[25:06] has the method she knows what to do she
[25:08] knows how to do it right so God uses
[25:10] that method also so if y'all have a
[25:16] problem with teeth you know you got a
[25:19] system so it just it's the same it's the
[25:23] same you know not how brother over here
[25:25] we got a but insurance man now we got a
[25:27] doctor it is just but God said these
[25:31] things in the church but what makes them
[25:36] who they are it's not the education it's
[25:40] the God that's in them that will make
[25:43] them different from all the others
[25:47] who have gotten their degrees and
[25:49] everything else
[25:50] y'all see what I'm saying I appreciate
[25:53] it
[25:53] chichi they had the spinner to get there
[25:56] you just don't jump there you know you
[25:57] have the work but in all of that I'd
[26:00] obviously don't manage me I appreciate
[26:01] this God brings us to a place I mean let
[26:05] me say like this when we think about
[26:08] eternal life as I said and you show I
[26:11] showed you last week where I had that
[26:13] one piece of paper and that hope is a
[26:16] paper with eternal life that was calling
[26:17] everything there was nothing outside of
[26:20] that sheet of paper God is in all he
[26:22] feel all he's above all he's through all
[26:25] there's nothing on the outside for God
[26:27] to shop for everything that God needs
[26:30] was in
[26:32] every attribute that God wanted to
[26:35] express was already in him is that right
[26:39] even the Bible said that God said if
[26:41] there be another god I don't know him
[26:46] Alleluia so therefore all these other
[26:49] things that consider a call themselves
[26:51] God or just fake us imaginations is that
[26:57] right
[26:58] and Jesus Christ and then proved it when
[27:02] God sent Moses down to Pharaoh
[27:04] amen fail no thought he was a god until
[27:07] he met God I never could never thought
[27:11] he was God until he met God see there
[27:15] are people who think they're gods but I
[27:17] tell you what none of them can raise the
[27:20] dead
[27:21] none of them can give you breath of life
[27:23] none of them can heal the sick is that
[27:26] right
[27:26] listen even down in Egypt when Pharaoh
[27:29] when Moses called for diseases let this
[27:31] plague happen let this play happen chan
[27:34] is in jammers call for the plagues these
[27:37] all know that they were able to do that
[27:39] did you know those same plagues they
[27:41] call they kept they called every disease
[27:47] they call for they call it the saddest
[27:50] part of it was they weren't able to
[27:51] dismiss it they couldn't get rid of it
[27:54] because you see it took the God who
[27:56] creates to undo it Moses was the only
[28:01] one that could call and those frogs and
[28:04] Royals and everything else had to see I
[28:07] love it see when you thank you something
[28:11] God will prove me to be nothing here in
[28:15] proverbs 3 and 1 he says my son forget
[28:18] not my law but let thine heart keep I
[28:21] commend for length of days and longer
[28:24] life and peace shall they add to deep
[28:28] let not mercy and truth for safety
[28:31] find him about thy neck write them upon
[28:34] the tables of thine heart so thou so
[28:38] shalt thou find favor and good
[28:40] understanding in the sight of God and
[28:42] may that in the in the Lord with all
[28:45] that trustees may trust yes it trust in
[28:49] the Lord with all thine heart and lean
[28:52] not to thine own understanding in all
[28:57] that way acknowledge him and he shall
[29:01] direct but if Eve had only not lean if
[29:17] she would have just kept in faith but
[29:20] God had told us we would not be where we
[29:23] are
[29:26] but surely you'll not die because it if
[29:34] you break one word if you eat of the
[29:37] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[29:39] you shall surely not and that old
[29:41] serpent came a hissy I'm gonna tell
[29:45] people you find a little they men
[29:48] they all up
[29:54] hey you better watch that y'all
[29:57] understand me so you look at these
[29:59] thinking yes and what do you mean
[30:01] brother Brooks if you trust in the Lord
[30:10] don't go oh Lord
[30:12] the doctors say I'm gonna die right
[30:21] and because you don't you know listen
[30:23] when you have a purpose alright I'll
[30:26] just need that Pharaoh could not kill
[30:29] him but God had already given him a
[30:33] purpose when you know let you the pride
[30:36] of Jesus Christ and God reveal to you
[30:38] you're gonna take the rapture no Dublin
[30:41] hair can take you officer hallelujah if
[30:47] the only way you can trust God in the
[30:49] way that you should
[30:50] you must be bound by love that right
[30:58] you must be powered by love even when it
[31:04] came to motion a pause let me stay like
[31:08] this
[31:09] they were pow pow by changes like levels
[31:14] of love to do the will of God that's
[31:18] that's only he was a prisoner there was
[31:20] a prison he was a fail he was in a don't
[31:26] you wish that God had you so bound up
[31:30] that all you just love his Satan didn't
[31:33] mean no nothing to you he come around
[31:36] you and you like ignore him you know
[31:38] come on y'all know it's true if somebody
[31:42] likes you and you don't like them you
[31:43] don't have no problem I don't care how
[31:47] they look they can dress their best and
[31:50] you know try to show off but if you
[31:51] don't like them don't bother you one bit
[31:54] Wow because you throw in love with
[31:57] someone else
[31:59] that's how it is with the true believer
[32:03] you become someone that has to walk
[32:06] sometime by themselves about yourself
[32:11] when you really love God Satan hates you
[32:15] [Music]
[32:16] hmm we say they saw all the time where
[32:21] he leaves me I will follow huh we need
[32:26] to repair
[32:31] hallelujah we don't follow he leads but
[32:34] we just don't follow like we ought to
[32:37] hallelujah is that right this and here's
[32:40] another thing the Bible says blessed is
[32:42] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[32:44] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[32:47] of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of
[32:50] the scornful you know we do that even in
[32:54] church
[32:55] somebody get all happy and then some of
[32:57] us Amen make our remarks in our minds
[33:00] but don't take all that let me tell you
[33:02] something it takes more than what we
[33:04] give it more than what we kiddin we need
[33:09] to give you more hallelujah I get
[33:14] jealous sometimes
[33:15] you know you had a restaurant and
[33:17] something and they playin footballer
[33:19] whatever basketball in there and they
[33:21] hit important
[33:25] the waves come through the television

[33:31] scream aah
[33:33] because they have been transformed into
[33:36] that dimension and they have become a
[33:38] part of the game as though they were
[33:40] there hallelujah and the Bible said we
[33:43] set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[33:46] and as they worship in heaven we ought
[33:49] to be worshiping here if we just get in
[33:53] the spirit of God and then you'll see
[33:55] and then that same on auntie is here
[33:58] right now passing through this building
[34:02] shouldn't be a quiet soul in here let me
[34:06] say like this this is the quietest grace
[34:09] ever when I say this I'm not talking

[34:46] purpose and our purpose our purpose our
[34:49] main purpose is to reflect heaven let

[34:58] heaven
[34:59] whatever they doing in heaven Lord let
[35:01] me do it on earth you say well I'm not
[35:06] in heaven but you need to be born again

[35:17] acknowledge my sins unto thee and by
[35:19] iniquities have I not hear I said I will
[35:22] confess my transgressions unto the Lord

[35:38] little bit beyond sin

[35:57] seed must be made manifest and while is
[36:01] growing up in you you gonna make
[36:04] mistakes hallelujah
[36:07] but we have a way of escape by way of
[36:10] confession if you confess your sin he is
[36:13] faithful and just to forgive you of your
[36:15] sins and to cleanse you from all
[36:18] unrighteousness boom or somebody ought

[39:28] righteousness and all these things will
[39:30] be added unto you

[39:45] care this work I don't care this

[40:00] Trust is something else I can't explain
[40:04] it but all I know when God's just gave
[40:07] me that revelation of trust I thought
[40:09] sometimes you think you have revelation
[40:11] but the Lord showed me he said I'll
[40:19] never leave you I will always be
[40:23] [Music]

[40:28] when you last see them they come in your
[40:31] life right in winterthur think that's
[40:33] not heavenly you lost trust in God some
[40:38] way so I need toy the Bible said in his
[40:42] presence is the fullness of joy shop if
[40:46] you're not in his palette don't expect
[40:48] fullness of joy

[41:51] weapon formed against you shall prosper
[41:53] not even in their attempt to have a long
[41:58] list but there's one thing that he
[42:01] doesn't have power over and that is the
[42:03] blood of Jesus hallelujah and the blood
[42:06] of Jesus washes away every sin and
[42:09] cleanses everything so he is all you did

[53:48] thing you can do is yield to him I'm
[53:52] almost done with this section it's
[53:56] perfection excuse me God's character and
[54:00] if I think that right because of calling
[54:05] the Peter that right Peter said of all
[54:08] these virtues you you'll never be
[54:10] bearing neither will you fall you will
[54:12] never be hallelujah but he said if you

[55:04] you are prisoner y'all hear what I'm
[55:08] sayin
[55:08] when you are a prisoner I want you
[55:11] relative once you become a personal God
[55:12] God gives you whatever you desire to
[55:15] have you become a mature
[55:31] [Music]
[55:40] because they came from a supernatural
[55:43] world hallelujah and when you realize
[55:46] that once you wanna get you no longer
[55:48] just natural but you have become
[55:50] supernatural and your life is
[55:53] supernatural
[56:00] nowhere near
[56:04] [Music]
[56:06] they're like this you
[56:10] [Music]
[56:15] or is it
[56:23] [Music]
[56:30] [Music]
[56:32] but Jesus was the knight and the Bible
[56:35] said he was the life of me in other
[56:38] words when we saw Jesus we saw the first
[56:41] every story he was the very adamant give
[56:45] up call the second Adam of the last he
[56:47] was the Adam that we were supposed to
[56:50] see and understand he was the father
[57:08] [Music]
[57:12] the second atom would Jesus Christ we
[57:16] must be born again
[57:18] right and when when you're born again
[57:21] now you become a part of God and
[57:24] whatever God is if I say whatever it is
[57:27] you are in this world that's your spirit
[57:32] but but but but listen how many of them
[57:35] you know they don't get it
[57:39] but you and I must get it if you want to
[57:43] make a rafter you must get it and you
[57:45] know what that is the whole thing behind
[57:48] it is submission making a rapture you
[57:53] must submit to Christ you must take this
[57:56] word this is Lord whatever you want me
[57:57] to do this is what I love it
[57:59] whatever I'm gonna stop doing this what
[58:01] I will stop you know I'm gonna do
[58:03] everything you told me to do in this
[58:04] time when you get an attitude like that
[58:06] god I didn't see you
[58:08] yes she will so let me say like this
[58:13] Moses he could have stopped Pharaoh with
[58:16] the power and authority that move is
[58:18] that right because God told Moses I'm
[58:20] sending you down to Egypt and you're
[58:22] going to be gone with your tips
[58:25] was he not he was God to the Egyptian he
[58:29] didn't have to put up with Pharaohs
[58:30] nonsense but he was such a prisoner he
[58:34] was not going to move into Gaza and
[58:36] whatever God said do he did it right who
[58:41] was the truth you think about Paul if
[58:45] Paul wanted to stop those people from
[58:48] beat him and killing him Paul for the
[58:51] did it he could have done it
[58:53] Paul had the authority to do it but he
[58:57] was so imprisoned here's a love yous is
[59:00] bound by love is the character of Christ
[59:05] was to be seen and that's what we must
[59:08] understand no matter what we suffer God
[59:10] is looking for the character of Christ
[59:13] we can't get around these people
[59:15] you know some of us I'm telling you what
[59:17] the problem is is that we don't want to
[59:19] submit we won't we want our own Crespi's
[59:22] we want our own purpose we want
[59:24] everything to super see what God called
[59:26] us to be and when you do that you are
[59:29] see of being anointed by the devil yummy
[59:33] because Lucifer was the one who chose to
[59:36] do something outside of the
[59:39] he wanted to be more
[59:42] [Music]
[59:48] first Peter 1:3 3:11 I'm not gonna read
[59:50] it but this is how you confirm you
[59:53] election
[59:58] [Music]
[1:00:02] but I'm saying it close
[1:00:07] we talk about purpose
[1:00:10] that's why so many churches do this what
[1:00:14] I'm thinking is not
[1:00:16] they're men all over the world
[1:00:20] and we're not organized we're not part
[1:00:23] of a union that the same
[1:00:26] and it's easy when table against
[1:00:31] that right miss Paul was nowhere near
[1:00:34] the disciples would be nice
[1:00:36] with all met Jesus on the road to
[1:00:40] Damascus
[1:00:41] two men even have he is in the desert
[1:00:42] came back preaching the same gospel but
[1:00:47] because the Holy Ghost will teach you we
[1:00:50] have teachers don't get me wrong but
[1:00:53] when there's I come to places in the
[1:00:58] spotlight says Lord what do you mean
[1:00:59] he's real and he tells me lean not to
[1:01:05] your own understanding so you know if
[1:01:14] you know anything about five
[1:01:20] burning cabin it's during a time when
[1:01:24] the cattle has given birth to dates
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:35] you know you know
[1:01:40] you don't know but they just get
[1:01:42] together they just carry on
[1:01:45] but when they get to the destiny these
[1:01:48] cows begin to make certain noises I
[1:01:51] don't care that little pal never loads
