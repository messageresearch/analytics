[18:14] in reality I'm glad holding to me
[18:19] hallelujah ain't God good not prolonging
[18:23] the time we're just gonna get no let's
[18:25] pray for a minute minutes huh brother uh
[18:29] Samuel takes to be in he's having
[18:32] trouble with his computer with all of
[18:34] his work on it
[18:35] and he's at home trying to revive it or
[18:38] trying to save it I don't know what's
[18:39] the problem
[18:40] but let's just pray right now that God
[18:42] would bless it father we come before you
[18:45] right now and your lovely name Jesus you
[18:49] are God that supplies all of our needs
[18:51] and father you know our brother wanted
[18:53] to come to church but the enemy has
[18:55] gotten into his computer and when I
[18:57] don't know what the situation is but
[18:59] father I've seen you heal cars and you
[19:02] can heal a computer I've seen you take
[19:05] cars and run them without even gasps
[19:07] father Lord and is there anything too
[19:10] hard for you no Lord I've seen you Lord
[19:13] touch even my own iPad father bless him
[19:16] now
[19:17] bless him now that he'll lose none of
[19:20] its work father we ask these things in
[19:23] your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[19:25] amen you may be seated I have not as yet
[19:31] found out where I misplaced my Bible but
[19:37] I know God knows where is that amen so
[19:42] we think r4 is Grace in its mercy and
[19:45] glad to be one in the number we are
[19:49] blessed people I say that all the time I
[19:52] can't seem to emphasize how I see things
[19:56] and I'm sure you see them in the same
[19:58] way or even better than I see them I
[20:00] look at times in the situations in which
[20:04] we're living in and I often think
[20:06] sometimes do people really know the time
[20:09] we're living in brother Branham brought
[20:14] such a powerful message the message of
[20:18] Jesus Christ the message itself is
[20:22] prophecy because the Bible said the
[20:24] spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of
[20:26] prophecy and through this message we
[20:29] have eyes to see we can see the time
[20:32] we're living in we can see all that's
[20:34] going on with us but you know one thing
[20:38] I've learned by Paul and I believe the
[20:41] prophet of God said that Paul laughed in
[20:44] the face of death and I've learned I've
[20:47] been learning how to really laugh in the
[20:49] face of Satan because when Satan think
[20:52] he has something over you and God has
[20:54] already given you the victory it becomes
[20:58] comical it becomes laughable and say -
[21:03] no enemy likes to be laughed at
[21:10] even friends when you laugh at them
[21:12] sometime they want to know what you
[21:14] laugh and add laughter can be something
[21:18] that you can enjoy together and sometime
[21:22] laughter becomes mockery let us stand
[21:29] we're going to come from two passages of
[21:31] Scripture the first will be coming from
[21:34] st. John the fourteenth chapter six
[21:36] verse and then we'll be coming from
[21:39] Psalms 19:1 through six
[21:54] appreciate you all because there are so
[21:58] many people I'll put it this way some
[22:01] people feel like it's just a trick of
[22:05] the enemy I have been thinking about it
[22:09] some people feel like you know brother
[22:12] Brooks is just not deep enough they
[22:15] don't say it but I hear it and they
[22:19] don't know I hear it but I do hear it
[22:21] and I put it this way my lord told me
[22:27] that God reveals himself in simplicity
[22:31] and I realized that in all of the things
[22:35] that I've heard in this message being
[22:40] deep enough will never be deep enough to
[22:45] the deep those who are call themselves
[22:50] deep and I have seen that in in them
[22:55] being people being deep they have a
[22:58] tendency to leave the message they stray
[23:01] off into something that they can't
[23:03] return back to but if you keep it like
[23:07] brother branham say we're supposed to
[23:09] keep it those simple things will become
[23:13] deep and I think the greatest the
[23:18] deepest thing I've ever encountered is
[23:21] love because people still don't know how
[23:24] to do it yet they say they understand it
[23:27] so if we can understand that real deep
[23:32] which is the love of God that the Bible
[23:35] said that surpasses all knowledge
[23:39] conquers everything right that is the
[23:44] deep things of God so as we stand st.
[23:50] John 14:6 Jesus
[23:56] unto him I am the way the truth and the
[24:02] life and no man cometh unto the father
[24:06] but by me one more scripture I'm not
[24:14] throwing off at anybody I'm just saying
[24:17] it's just something I felt led to say
[24:20] and I know perhaps somebody else may be
[24:23] listening so I felt led to say it and I
[24:26] said it Psalms 19:1 through six
[24:31] they haven't declare the glory of God
[24:35] and the firmament showeth his handiwork
[24:41] day unto day uttereth speech and night
[24:44] unto night short knowledge there is no
[24:48] speech nor language where their voice is
[24:51] not heard their line has gone out
[24:55] through all the nations and their words
[24:57] to the end of the world and in them have
[25:00] he set a tabernacle for the Sun which is
[25:04] as a bridegroom coming out of his
[25:07] chamber and majoras as a strong man to
[25:11] run a race his going forth is from the
[25:16] end of the earth and his circuits unto
[25:19] the end of it and there is nothing here
[25:23] from the heat thereof
[25:25] let us pray father God we come before
[25:28] your Lord as humbly as we know how and
[25:31] we thank you for being so good to us
[25:36] sometimes Lord we travel and we realize
[25:41] oh god that all things are in your
[25:44] control there is nothing that is not in
[25:48] your control we think you have any
[25:51] father for your divine purpose that you
[25:56] are or you are you working through us
[25:59] Lord we're here to give you the glory
[26:01] honor and the praise you're worthy of
[26:04] all bless his service in a special way
[26:08] and we'll be
[26:09] to give you the praise in Jesus Christ's
[26:12] name we pray amen
[26:14] you may be seated I thought that the
[26:20] Lord gave me and I have been just
[26:25] chewing on in a time
[26:26] I'm trusting that he will really bring
[26:32] it out as I think about where we are
[26:39] we're in Laodicea that age we know now
[26:47] is darkest as than has ever been and so
[26:54] I believe that the Holy Spirit gave me
[26:57] this thought birth out of darkness now
[27:05] remember that's not the way it was
[27:07] supposed to be because when Adam and Eve
[27:12] was told to be fruitful and multiply
[27:16] there was no darkness the darkness in
[27:21] itself had been placed in a different
[27:26] category remember in Genesis the Bible
[27:33] said
[27:33] the earth was void and darkness covered
[27:38] the face of the deep but underneath that
[27:43] darkness there were seeds and out of
[27:48] that darkness came the birth of seeds
[27:52] because when God said let there be light
[27:55] he first separated the darkness from the
[27:58] light but there was something to be born
[28:02] out of that darkness but it was a light
[28:06] that had to be revealed I had to reveal
[28:08] what was there and I find out that that
[28:13] that pattern God used from the beginning
[28:18] all the way to the end we know the
[28:23] scripture said is is darkest before dawn
[28:26] and when Dawn comes that it it is a
[28:30] breaking fourth of the Sun right now the
[28:34] sun is shining somewhere it's still
[28:39] there
[28:40] but the Bible tells us that it's on a
[28:43] circuit it has a chamber it has a
[28:46] pattern we know by God's grace that this
[28:52] pattern is like a death barrier and
[28:56] resurrection we've seen it we know it it
[28:59] speaks to us the same Sun that dies in
[29:03] the evening is the same Sun that
[29:05] resurrects in the morning and the Bible
[29:08] said that every time it comes back up to
[29:10] his resurrection it's like a bridegroom
[29:13] coming out of his chambers ready to run
[29:18] a race the part that I like it says that
[29:24] it comes out of his chamber and rejoices
[29:29] it is a rejoicing when it comes out of
[29:35] this darkness have you ever seen in
[29:39] scientists when they show you the birth
[29:42] of a seed how that seed comes out of
[29:47] ground and they speed the camera up and
[29:48] it looks like let's see that plan is
[29:50] just rejoicing because it's living have
[29:56] you seen a child who's born in darkness
[29:59] created in his mother's womb and gives
[30:03] birth and from that darkness he enters
[30:06] into light and the light is so bright
[30:09] till God has failed him veiled his eyes
[30:14] so that his sight he won't become blind
[30:20] but that child no doubt rejoices in his
[30:24] own way we don't know what it feels like
[30:29] we can't remember but it's born out of
[30:33] darkness things that it is a hidden that
[30:35] child is becomes a revelation veiled by
[30:39] the mother's womb and when that veil is
[30:42] broken and that child come forth then we
[30:45] can see whether it's male female or
[30:47] scientist is falling that but you know
[30:50] in the normal everything must go through
[30:53] a dark period we we sing songs about how
[30:59] the storm is passing over and usually
[31:04] when we sing those songs we're working
[31:07] with a dark time darkness behind it may
[31:15] cover but God has also designed that
[31:20] darkness doesn't remain always there's a
[31:23] light coming somewhere we talk about
[31:28] darkness when we talk about the ages we
[31:32] talk about the time when the Catholic
[31:33] Church rule we said it was a dark age
[31:36] and then we find out that according to
[31:40] the scriptures I believe Joelle says
[31:42] there shall be light in the evening time
[31:46] so that dark period covers everything it
[31:50] veils it but it doesn't mean that
[31:52] whatever is veiling it's dead sometime
[31:56] it is just a place of hiding because
[31:59] that's really what a seat is
[32:00] when you plant the seed in the ground it
[32:02] becomes a hiding place because if you
[32:05] don't plant it deep enough the birds
[32:07] will come and eat it up so it also
[32:10] becomes a crate a grave is that right I
[32:14] believe even David said hide me in the
[32:17] grave until my his wrath is passed so it
[32:21] don't be a dark place there's always
[32:24] light God used life he hides it there
[32:28] until that appointed time one thing I
[32:33] want to say by God's grace we are living
[32:35] in a tremendous time and even though
[32:39] this age is dark and it seems to get
[32:42] darker we are the life that is hidden
[32:47] our lives are hidden what did God do
[32:51] even when it came to Jesus God took him
[32:54] from Bethlehem and hid him in a dark
[32:56] country called
[32:57] Egypt but then when God was ready to
[33:01] pull light up and bring it to his
[33:03] manifestation God drew him out of Egypt
[33:06] and the next time you see Jesus in the
[33:09] temple teaching the Pharisees bringing
[33:15] them to a light and the Bible says they
[33:18] wouldn't even comprehend it they didn't
[33:21] know who he was but there was light give
[33:24] him and that little child at his time a
[33:28] man was going to grow into a a greater
[33:31] life understand by God's grace because
[33:35] of sin God has ordained that light comes
[33:40] by way of a prophet is that right Amos
[33:44] 3:7 says God will not do nothing except
[33:48] he revealed it to his servants the
[33:50] Prophet even in the time of Noah it was
[33:53] a dark time but there were still few
[33:57] that had life and that was normal
[34:00] Noah and his house it got so dark at
[34:03] that time God said it repented him that
[34:07] he had made mankind but that was the
[34:10] process that was the way God would do he
[34:12] would birth he would bring a birth
[34:14] out of darkness you would bring light
[34:16] out of darkness and we find out like I
[34:19] said it continues to be that way now the
[34:23] greatest God has ever done as far as I'm
[34:26] concerned is what he's doing in this age
[34:29] he placed seeds in this age under the
[34:35] darkest age ever but those fees have
[34:40] been predestinated to penetrate the
[34:45] darkness just because he ordained it my
[34:50] sheep hear is my voice
[34:52] y'all hear me now the beautiful thing is
[34:55] is that we have come at the correlation
[34:59] of this gospel we've come to the very
[35:01] end of it we come to me in where all
[35:05] will be gathered together and take a
[35:08] flight and what's so beautiful is that
[35:12] our prophet have gone beyond the curtain
[35:15] of time that we may have a glimpse of
[35:19] what lays ahead of us is that right he
[35:24] comes back and he encouraged us he says
[35:26] whatever you do you keep pressing on
[35:29] don't give up this is a dark age but
[35:34] beautiful things come out of this thing
[35:37] is that right we would have never known
[35:40] if we could look down and look through
[35:43] the eyes of Moses when he was writing
[35:45] that script of the earth was void and
[35:47] without form and the darkness covered
[35:49] the face of the deep you know God showed
[35:52] him little by little by little and no
[35:55] doubt he was so probably amazed at the
[35:59] beauty of the earth when God finished it
[36:03] you mean to tell me all of that was
[36:06] under all that darkness absolutely and
[36:11] remember now you got to have your dark
[36:15] times it has to come whether you like it
[36:20] or not darkness come before your final
[36:24] Exodus
[36:25] is that right the Bible said that before
[36:29] God him even though had a prophet they
[36:31] saw all the miracles they saw the signs
[36:34] and wonders but before they could get
[36:36] out of Egypt darkness had to cover the
[36:39] earth
[36:40] hey the Bible said that the dog is in
[36:43] Egypt was so dark you could feel it
[36:48] hallelujah
[36:49] but in the midst of that darkness was a
[36:53] seed call Israel hallelujah and the
[36:57] Bible said I will call my son Israel out
[37:01] of Egypt it was ordained but before they
[37:05] could go Israel had become dark excuse
[37:10] me Egypt had become dark because it's
[37:13] darkest before dawn y'all hear me and we
[37:18] find out Amen that here was so dark but
[37:20] yet the Bible said there was light in
[37:23] Goshen every time I think about that I
[37:27] think about me I think about you I think
[37:30] about the bride of Jesus Christ no
[37:32] matter how dark it gets there's always
[37:35] light in Goshen hallelujah if we look
[37:45] back in the old days in the Old
[37:46] Testament you'll find out that God
[37:50] always did a strange thing and I don't
[37:55] know all of the glory that he gets out
[37:57] of it maybe it's to show that darkness
[38:00] cannot prevail because remember the
[38:04] story of Samson Samson had his eyes
[38:08] Samson did some mighty exploits but he
[38:12] got caught up with the world is that
[38:16] right and when he got caught up with
[38:19] Delilah he begins to lose his sight now
[38:22] I understand you Samson was already
[38:25] blind he was blind before they put his
[38:28] eyes out he was already blind when he
[38:32] fell in love with Delilah he was blinded
[38:35] when he told his car
[38:39] to her he was already blinded and
[38:43] because he was already spiritually blind
[38:46] God put his eyes out but it was in his
[38:49] darkness in his darkest time is when he
[38:54] sought God y'all hear me sometimes we
[38:58] have is so easy is that right
[39:01] God can do so many things for us and we
[39:03] see sometimes we take it for granted
[39:05] sometimes we get like Samson you know
[39:08] what I'm saying is that right what did
[39:11] God say to her to to up to a brand of
[39:14] tabernacle so you get in common things
[39:17] happening and you don't get excited no
[39:19] more and what did he scream out he said
[39:22] a brand of tabernacle the Philistines is
[39:26] upon you what was he saying you're
[39:28] losing your sight you're allowing the
[39:31] world to blind you hello
[39:35] but still there was a future in it
[39:37] because it's only when things are dark
[39:40] when you really cry out for God is that
[39:44] right it is during notes time you seek
[39:47] light come on some of it and when you
[39:51] began to call on God because of who you
[39:54] are
[39:54] God allows you to break through that's
[39:57] what the Bible says with every
[39:59] temptation there is a way of escape
[40:06] hallelujah
[40:08] see we are born to break through this
[40:11] darkness huh the darkest age ever
[40:16] Laodicea people's rights hallelujah the
[40:21] age where the earth is called a quake
[40:23] the age with famines will increase the
[40:26] age with a love of many shall wax cold
[40:29] the age amendment went well well that
[40:34] where they're called wrong right and
[40:36] right Rome hallelujah it is in this age
[40:39] that God allowed us to be the darkest of
[40:43] all ages but guess what this is where we
[40:47] break for this is where we're born this
[40:51] is where we come sought out
[40:53] darkness and guess what God is getting
[40:56] ready to gather his people the prophet
[41:01] of God took brother Ben God took the
[41:03] prophet of God beyond the curtain of
[41:06] time and he said how that if when he was
[41:12] there there was a voice talking to him
[41:15] and here he found himself in the reality
[41:21] of who he was really took shape there
[41:26] because now he he was told that he was a
[41:30] leader and he was set upon a bigger or
[41:33] higher chair and he asked a question he
[41:37] said are all these branham's and he says
[41:39] no all of these are your converts he
[41:43] said there were millions of them there
[41:47] Millions
[41:48] and the angel said well you know you've
[41:51] got to be judged because she was a
[41:52] leader and he has to question he said it
[41:56] was Paul judged because I preached
[42:00] everything that Paul preached and the
[42:04] millions said think about it we're
[42:07] resting on that I don't know what kind
[42:10] of microphone system they have whatever
[42:13] the PA system is all of them heard him
[42:16] and said we're resting on that is that
[42:20] right so when we look we understand that
[42:25] this this messenger God sent him to give
[42:30] us an assurance of our deliverance is
[42:34] that right
[42:35] we knew he was going to come I put it
[42:38] that way
[42:38] because whenever God gets ready to do
[42:41] something he cannot do it without a
[42:47] prophet a preach
[42:51] just a preacher couldn't open the seals
[42:54] it takes a prophet Moses was a prophet
[42:59] and nobody knew that the world was going
[43:03] to be destroyed
[43:04] I said Moses I've met Noah Noah was a
[43:09] prophet and nobody knew that the world
[43:12] was going to be destroyed by Noah Noah
[43:14] he had the written blueprints he had
[43:18] everything that the people needed to
[43:20] escape hallelujah but to see before he
[43:25] could reign it had to become total
[43:28] darkness on the earth you don't think so
[43:31] when they did that that that scientific
[43:34] experience and those dark clouds got to
[43:37] roll in I guarantee you the whole world
[43:41] went into a blackout huh
[43:45] but it was what was coming out of that
[43:47] blackout a new generation a new people
[43:52] but they still had to go through the
[43:55] darkness Oh what inspired me it's
[44:00] because we're getting ready to go
[44:01] through a real dog moment we're gonna
[44:04] experience you know the stock market it
[44:07] will crash we also know that California
[44:10] is going to sink hallelujah now we've
[44:13] hoped that these things take place after
[44:16] we're gone but we don't know with that
[44:19] earthquake that just took place out
[44:21] there I keep telling people as if folks
[44:24] that's just the beginning it's moving
[44:29] and it never stopped moving when that
[44:32] angel struck the west coast in 1962 and
[44:36] that California almost sank he said it
[44:41] kept shaking from then on and what did
[44:43] it do it kept moving moving and it's
[44:47] still moving
[44:48] hallelujah but I understand people of
[44:52] God Amen that out of this darkness it
[44:54] was never to be so because everything
[44:58] was supposed to be light hallelujah but
[45:01] because of sin we were born in shape
[45:04] Nicke wa t and iniquity is darkness it's
[45:09] not light
[45:10] it's darkness it is the fruit of the
[45:13] devil and the devil represents darkness
[45:16] and out of this darkness though God
[45:20] planted a seed in you and I hallelujah
[45:23] and in that darkness hallelujah there is
[45:27] a true seed of God on the inside you say
[45:30] what brother bear is cosmic like yes but
[45:33] it's still darkness compared to what
[45:35] you're seeing here hallelujah
[45:38] is that right look before Jesus let me
[45:45] read it Luke 22 and there should be
[45:48] signs in the Sun and in the moon and in
[45:51] the Stars and upon the earth distress of
[45:54] Nations with perplexity the sea and the
[45:57] waves rowing me and hearts failing them
[45:59] for fear and for looking after those
[46:02] things which are coming on the earth for
[46:04] the power heavens shall be shaken and
[46:07] then shall they see the Son of man
[46:09] coming in a cloud with power and great
[46:11] glory and when these things began to
[46:14] come to pass then look up and lift up
[46:17] your heads for your Redemption draweth
[46:20] nigh hallelujah now you and I have seen
[46:25] so many crazy things happening in the
[46:28] heavens and on the earth amen and tell
[46:32] me what nation is not progressed
[46:35] hallelujah
[46:36] well you said all brother Bruce what are
[46:39] you trying to say and heart aches heart
[46:41] aches not only just heart aches heart
[46:43] attacks have increased among men why
[46:46] because they are afraid of what's coming
[46:48] on the earth and when Jesus died the
[46:58] heaven the son
[47:01] the show the stars disappeared the
[47:06] earthquake hey but you gotta realize
[47:09] something major was happening here this
[47:13] wasn't just a seed this was be seed
[47:15] this was the seed of God the seed of
[47:19] Resurrection when that seed was planted
[47:22] and it came up God understand me
[47:28] everything went black the earthquake the
[47:34] darkness covered everything that the
[47:40] train was rented hallelujah and I always
[47:44] thought the train was rented when the
[47:46] you know but it was dark it was dark it
[47:50] wasn't like God it bright dark and
[47:52] everything else shook everything think
[47:56] about it and then on the day heroes who
[48:02] serum said the darkness came before the
[48:06] resurrection hallelujah the earth
[48:10] choukaku you and the graves were open go
[48:14] to God see well I'm going with there's
[48:17] coming a darkness but there's also
[48:20] coming a resurrection there's a new
[48:24] birth coming and we won't be just
[48:26] brought into our theophany will be
[48:28] brought into God's glorified body
[48:31] hallelujah
[48:33] see it takes the light to reveal it
[48:37] though everybody won't get up only those
[48:43] who have a ear to hear and those who
[48:48] that voice will gather my sheep here at
[48:52] my voice and the stranger they will not
[48:55] follow see brother Brandon wasn't just
[48:58] sent here to preach the gospel but he
[49:00] came together the Seas of God that God
[49:04] had labored bride y'all hear what I'm
[49:08] saying
[49:09] but he told us now this
[49:12] he said uh-oh he talked about how wicked
[49:14] what it was and how bad it was becoming
[49:17] and how that he didn't he you know that
[49:19] he didn't want his children to live you
[49:21] know in this world and you know and I
[49:24] think sometime if he could see what it
[49:26] looks like now but it has to be Hema
[49:32] seducers shall wax worse the darkness
[49:35] must become so thick and where you feel
[49:40] it y'all don't feel it
[49:42] some places you go you feel it but Jesus
[49:47] says I am the way the truth and the life
[49:51] I don't care how many people they gather
[49:56] there's only one voice and that voice is
[50:00] a sign it is coming about a change every
[50:04] time Israel gots too bad or so bad God
[50:08] sent them a profit and that profit had
[50:12] the Word of God and that probably was
[50:15] saying unto the Israel you have gotten
[50:18] so dark your ways of God so wicked you
[50:21] have come to a place where God is that
[50:25] pleased with your Jeremiah they wouldn't
[50:33] prepared he was preaching they didn't do
[50:38] much with him either and you said well
[50:42] what do you mean brother think about it
[50:44] it was 400 years or more 480 I believe
[50:48] that Israel was left in darkness and the
[50:53] Bible said there was no voice in the
[50:56] land and the people did what was
[50:59] pleasing in their sight and think how
[51:02] long it was between Malachi and the
[51:04] coming of Jesus the Bible said without a
[51:08] vision the people perish you can't have
[51:12] a vision without light hallelujah and so
[51:18] when God ordained a prophet people of
[51:20] God he just not didn't know Dana man
[51:22] that want to be powerful he was
[51:25] illiterate
[51:26] voice of God he was absolutely God in
[51:29] flesh not that he was God himself
[51:32] I said God in his flesh revealing him
[51:36] calling is that right
[51:38] when it got dark in the garden and Adam
[51:40] and Eve was lost who came the voice of
[51:44] God it was God who walks in the cool of
[51:46] the evening and says Adam Adam we're
[51:49] right now
[51:50] you didn't call for God God call for you
[52:00] if I said the truth shall make you free
[52:03] and with all the lies that we've got
[52:06] going on in this age everybody ought to
[52:09] be jumping for joy because God sent us a
[52:11] prophet or voice it's not worshiping the
[52:15] man but thank God for the ministry
[52:19] you got something the world is looking
[52:21] for if the Catholic looks and all of the
[52:26] different ones who shut in for 40 days
[52:28] and more if they knew what we knew no
[52:31] they'd be right here or somewhere like
[52:33] this you think those people shut in and
[52:37] fast and pray amen just to be doing it
[52:39] no they seeking for God they are sincere
[52:44] far more sincere than us
[52:46] and what we are hello but it's not him
[52:50] that really know he that run it it's God
[52:53] who shows mercy and I don't know what
[52:56] God gonna do with him I use them in a
[52:58] gig example but we got Pentecostals and
[53:01] everybody else that do we do the same
[53:03] thing we got people in this message who
[53:06] don't even know the messenger
[53:08] hello I'll say that again we got people
[53:12] in this message who do not even know the
[53:15] messenger hallelujah and you and I must
[53:21] realize amen you and I the only way see
[53:25] it was just the same in the Pentecostal
[53:28] realm they seek our tongues for the Holy
[53:32] Ghost in the message real they seek to
[53:35] know everything brother Branham said and
[53:37] did to qualify
[53:40] as a believer hallelujah
[53:44] when Paul even come and said we don't
[53:46] even know Jesus no more after the flesh
[53:50] hallelujah
[53:51] listen it doesn't matter if you can
[53:53] quote the problem for obey them through
[53:55] everything and you don't know Jesus if
[54:02] you don't know the Lord Jesus your heart
[54:04] has never been turned back right because
[54:09] the prophets message was to turn us back
[54:11] to the tiller Kostas father's and on the
[54:15] day of Pentecost Peter preached Jesus he
[54:21] got to know him you got to meet him is
[54:25] that right
[54:27] you got to meet God in the backside of
[54:30] the desert you say Oh what do you mean
[54:32] Moses was chosen
[54:34] Moses was elected yet Moses had to meet
[54:38] the God who chose him and the God who
[54:40] elected him and when he found him and
[54:43] when he met him he was a fire in a dead
[54:46] bush you got a notice fire hallelujah in
[54:54] this fire gotten over you is that right
[54:56] that fire did say now what's your name
[55:00] take your shoes off that fire called
[55:05] Moses by his name Moses you're standing
[55:09] on holy ground
[55:10] take off your shoes so when you come to
[55:15] this message when you meet God he has a
[55:18] standard of holiness and his first
[55:21] starts out by humbling yourself you'll
[55:24] never get it until you take your shoes
[55:26] off to you humble yourself you'll never
[55:30] understand this message until you humble
[55:33] yourself whoo Oh Lulu yeah whoo the
[55:40] Bible said that Moses when he stretched
[55:42] forth his hand toward heaven and there
[55:44] was a thick darkness in all the land of
[55:46] the age of three days they saw not one
[55:49] another
[55:50] neither rose any from his place for
[55:52] three days
[55:53] but all the children Israel had light in
[55:56] their dwellings huh
[55:58] it was so dog in Asia put him to bed for
[56:01] three days kind of like a death right
[56:05] but after three days Israel was ready to
[56:09] get up out of there he loved the Lord
[56:13] even like I said when Jesus died
[56:16] according to Matthew 27 said now from
[56:19] the sixth hour there was darkness over
[56:22] the land unto the ninth hour and about
[56:25] the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud
[56:27] voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani
[56:30] that is to say my God my God why has
[56:33] thou forsaken me some of them that stood
[56:36] there when they heard that said this man
[56:39] call it for Elias now I want you to
[56:42] understand just prior to his death what
[56:44] happened Jesus descended into the region
[56:47] of the loss huh like I said he was the
[56:51] only light in hell he went down there
[56:56] amen and he preached to them and said to
[56:59] them why did not you believe the message
[57:02] that Noah preached now Jimmy but while
[57:09] he was active down there something else
[57:12] was going on God was preparing for a
[57:16] resurrection is that right oh it's the
[57:19] truth
[57:20] God was not only prepared for a
[57:22] resurrection there was a parade getting
[57:25] ready to start there in heaven
[57:26] hallelujah is that right all lift up
[57:30] your gates we in your head you gazing
[57:32] and being lifted up is that right
[57:34] brother Branham said they screamed that
[57:36] out as they were marching into the gates
[57:39] of heaven huh the Old Testament Saint
[57:42] raised when Jesus raised what was it it
[57:47] was an exodus hallelujah it must get dog
[57:52] before the Exodus and we are getting
[57:57] ready for an exodus because when that
[58:00] earthquake listen oh let me hurry I got
[58:03] some work but you know that earthquake
[58:05] is not gonna be just an earthquake
[58:07] everybody think we'll praise the Lord
[58:10] California gonna sink but I'm gonna tell
[58:13] you something I'm a reader too in just a
[58:16] bit it's more than that it's more to it
[58:19] than just that because I know that when
[58:22] that earth is Craig shook when Jesus
[58:25] rose from the dead
[58:29] something happened it shook so much to
[58:33] the graves were open huh
[58:38] there was a resurrection of all who died
[58:42] in faith no matter where they were they
[58:46] got up
[58:48] that's why brother Bell talked about the
[58:50] 30 40 days all right let me move on you
[58:57] and I must understand by God's grace
[58:59] that God sees us through all these
[59:02] trials and things and that all of these
[59:06] things is to better you it's all about
[59:09] character it's about it's the better you
[59:12] it's all about character see we can quit
[59:16] so well I don't know why God is treating
[59:18] me like this and making me go through
[59:20] all this and I'm tired of suffering and
[59:22] all of that
[59:22] mm-hmm a real seed sticks and stay take
[59:28] whatever is coming to him no matter what
[59:31] it is we're like we're like Joe the Lord
[59:35] giveth and the Lord taketh away and
[59:38] blessed be the name of the Lord is that
[59:41] right
[59:42] think about what we have what's
[59:44] happening here if they don't listen they
[59:47] said like the Holy Spirit is telling me
[59:49] those stars are forever out there even
[59:54] in the daytime those stars are still
[59:57] there but it takes the darkness in order
[1:00:01] for the glory of those stars to be seen
[1:00:04] y'all you're insane and we are the
[1:00:07] brightest with the darkest age ever but
[1:00:11] our glorious the greatest of all the
[1:00:13] ages you see what I'm saying because
[1:00:17] it's so dark
[1:00:19] we shine better we glow better is that
[1:00:23] right we so Christ better it is so
[1:00:27] difficult to live a Christian life in
[1:00:30] this world without having Christ in you
[1:00:32] is that right
[1:00:37] listen the Bowser's now to him that is
[1:00:40] of power to establish you according to
[1:00:43] my gospel and the preaching of Jesus
[1:00:46] Christ according to the revelation of
[1:00:48] the mystery which was kept secret since
[1:00:50] the world began
[1:00:52] but now is made manifest by the
[1:00:54] scriptures of the prophets according to
[1:00:57] the commandments of everlasting God made
[1:00:59] known to all nations for the obedience
[1:01:02] of faith now this is Paul coming at the
[1:01:04] sixteenth chapter of Romans and Paul was
[1:01:07] able to say these things because he was
[1:01:09] a prophet is that right Paul told us
[1:01:12] that the greediest world was going to
[1:01:14] come in and this agent would change
[1:01:16] yourself into a angel of light and he
[1:01:18] told us about the the man of perdition
[1:01:20] the son of perdition that's actually on
[1:01:23] the rise right now and we don't see it
[1:01:26] because we don't look at seeing in and
[1:01:27] all that stuff we don't see it but a
[1:01:30] there is a union going on and this thing
[1:01:34] is picking up everything's being shaken
[1:01:38] the political realm the religious room
[1:01:41] hallelujah the social room everything is
[1:01:45] being shook this bride what we call
[1:01:49] bride is being shook but instead of
[1:01:54] trying to find a way of getting closer
[1:01:57] to God we are being distracted huh I
[1:02:01] think it was brother Branham on
[1:02:03] something brother preacher I heard talks
[1:02:05] about a baboon and I think Rick Kuhns
[1:02:08] would do the same thing they see little
[1:02:10] glittery stuff he said the best way to
[1:02:12] catch him is to put this thing in a hole
[1:02:14] and let it shine and then they stick
[1:02:17] their hand in there say you ain't gonna
[1:02:19] let it they gonna let it go even it
[1:02:22] because their death they ain't gonna let
[1:02:24] it go right and I know but Boone's do
[1:02:27] the same thing they love that shiny stop
[1:02:29] you know and that's what's happening to
[1:02:31] a lot of Christians amen right now the
[1:02:33] devil is
[1:02:34] coming and he's coming with the weapon
[1:02:35] to destroy you and you got the oh but
[1:02:38] it's so pretty in here
[1:02:39] oh I just like it oh don't you know
[1:02:43] people are doing that they won't let go
[1:02:46] to thing that's causing them death help
[1:02:53] us Jesus is that right to know that the
[1:03:02] mission was given to us what is the
[1:03:04] mystery Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:03:12] we thought we were the children of Wrath
[1:03:15] we acted like the children of Wrath but
[1:03:17] on the inside of this old Kookaburra
[1:03:20] Waseda
[1:03:21] and how did we know we were seed God had
[1:03:26] to bring his voice he had to bring a
[1:03:29] word he had to sign the light down in
[1:03:32] your soul to make you know you were
[1:03:34] different from all the world and what
[1:03:39] happened
[1:03:40] in that moment you were birthed out of
[1:03:43] darkness Lanta see is not a place it's a
[1:03:47] spirit it's a condition and God brought
[1:03:51] you out of that come out of her my
[1:03:53] people
[1:03:54] oh that's why we're not a system we're
[1:03:58] not a denomination you and I we we
[1:04:01] people's well I'm a message I'm word I
[1:04:05] don't belong to nothing but Jesus Christ
[1:04:08] himself hmm
[1:04:10] and until you get to that because you

[1:06:16] he wasn't because the mystery of Adam
[1:06:20] was he hallelujah and the mystery of
[1:06:24] Christ is his bride
[1:06:28] how we would have known you'll never
[1:06:31] know who you are until the birth comes
[1:06:34] it is that birth you receive your name
[1:06:40] up until here's you baby boy and baby
[1:06:42] girl I don't care what they call you you
[1:06:44] can't respond to a name yet mmm
[1:06:51] all help me somebody so let me hurry up
[1:06:54] almost done the bottom says according to
[1:06:57] Ephesians blessed be the God and father
[1:06:59] of our Lord Savior Jesus Christ who have
[1:07:01] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:07:03] in heavenly places in Christ we would
[1:07:06] have never known what that meant until
[1:07:09] this Bible became a new book when the
[1:07:12] seers were open it became a new book
[1:07:14] because it was then we found that how
[1:07:17] many I don't know I didn't go to a
[1:07:19] church that preached predestination I
[1:07:22] didn't go to a church that understood
[1:07:25] that I was in the mind of God huh but
[1:07:30] God sent a prophet that had that
[1:07:32] revelation and he said that revelation
[1:07:35] to us that we may be stripped away from
[1:07:38] the amnesia that we were born in amnesia
[1:07:43] is a form of darkness because you don't
[1:07:48] know who you are you don't know your
[1:07:50] identity it's a dark veil but when God
[1:07:54] took that veil off we began to rejoice
[1:07:57] hallelujah we began to praise God
[1:08:00] hallelujah because we now know who we
[1:08:03] are
[1:08:03] you can't know who everybody else is you
[1:08:07] got to know who you are
[1:08:09] accordingly if you've chosen us in him
[1:08:12] before the foundation of the world that
[1:08:14] we should be holy and without blame
[1:08:16] before him in love having predestinated
[1:08:19] oh I wish I could preach oh and my thing
[1:08:24] is you know I think about how all these
[1:08:26] years we wander around in darkness don't
[1:08:29] even know who we are you know like Rahab
[1:08:31] she didn't know who she was
[1:08:33] hallelujah she didn't one day say well
[1:08:35] one day I'm gonna be a child of God
[1:08:36] hallelujah she all she saw was hardship
[1:08:40] darkness hallelujah
[1:08:41] over there in Jericho huh
[1:08:45] but when Joshua showed up you know
[1:08:48] Joshua's Jesus you know when Joshua
[1:08:51] showed up it was a light and the light
[1:08:56] of the revelation she got was the blood
[1:08:58] if you put this scarlet ribbon on the
[1:09:02] outside the death angel will pass over
[1:09:05] you hallelujah and she put it out there
[1:09:09] and all of Jericho was destroyed except
[1:09:14] rehabbing a house and guess what she
[1:09:17] ended up in the royal family now she
[1:09:21] knows why because light
[1:09:23] she was birthed out of darkness
[1:09:25] hallelujah well you think about Hadassah
[1:09:28] right a little Jewish girl didn't know
[1:09:32] who she was raised up by her uncle
[1:09:34] Mordecai hallelujah and one day God put
[1:09:38] on a beauty contest she know you know
[1:09:41] she had to be pretty right hallelujah
[1:09:43] put on a beauty contest and she still
[1:09:45] didn't know when she won it
[1:09:49] she still didn't understand it until the
[1:09:52] pressure came a dog time and bought a
[1:09:56] car says don't you think that perhaps
[1:10:00] this is why you were born for such a
[1:10:03] time as this hallelujah God made her a
[1:10:06] mediator I like to say like that she
[1:10:09] stirred it between the king and the law
[1:10:12] pleading for her people hallelujah is
[1:10:15] that right and that's what the Queen of
[1:10:18] Heaven is doing tonight the bride of
[1:10:20] Jesus Christ stands right there pleading
[1:10:23] for the graison is that right is that
[1:10:25] the truth I will seal those who sigh and
[1:10:29] cry for the abominations done in the
[1:10:31] city see really that's what identifies
[1:10:35] you if the world is right if nothing is
[1:10:38] moving you now and you're not crying out
[1:10:40] before the Lord and you know me not you
[1:10:42] me not to cry about you know you may not
[1:10:44] have to cry like I cry because everybody
[1:10:46] cried differently for something
[1:10:48] everybody can sigh cry and
[1:10:52] oh you know them saying help your people
[1:10:57] and I find out that's what God has been
[1:10:59] doing not only just in my life but
[1:11:01] perhaps others other than just sign and
[1:11:03] climb from my life and everybody else's
[1:11:06] I'm Tom Maddie the bride because I see
[1:11:09] the coming of the Lord
[1:11:11] I see the coming of the Lord I see the
[1:11:15] coming of the Lord
[1:11:22] and people need to see we don't have
[1:11:25] much time where are we in this the
[1:11:30] statue of Christ how far do we have to
[1:11:32] go are we still holding onto silver
[1:11:34] things of little pleasurable things that
[1:11:36] we know that's evil before God you gotta
[1:11:39] let it go you can't do it but God can do
[1:11:42] it God is a deliverer hallelujah they
[1:11:46] were making sense hallelujah God wants
[1:11:53] us in perfect harmony with him this is
[1:11:56] why he's doing building us put the
[1:11:59] pressure on us because he know the true
[1:12:02] seed is all is it is written you know
[1:12:04] how you spank a child that child won't
[1:12:07] run from daddy and Mama that child grab
[1:12:10] your leg you know run to you
[1:12:13] you know now when they get older they
[1:12:15] run away from but when they're young
[1:12:17] when they're healing they want to get
[1:12:19] close to you you right because that's
[1:12:21] their way of saying I'm sorry and that
[1:12:24] ought to be our way of saying I'm sorry
[1:12:26] I just said except we come as a child
[1:12:28] we're no wise enter in when God spankers
[1:12:32] we're not supposed to run away we run to
[1:12:34] him hallelujah all right so much I want
[1:12:38] to say but I feel like I need to move on
[1:12:41] you see what you got to understand that
[1:12:45] the secret of this whole thing is you
[1:12:51] and you can't remain a secret there's a
[1:12:55] time you must be revealed the revelation
[1:12:57] of Christ must be revealed in you it's
[1:13:02] not just miracles anywhere anymore
[1:13:04] it's character that's why you've got so
[1:13:08] many battles in your mind against
[1:13:10] character not being sick like this but
[1:13:13] character that's where everything is
[1:13:16] about you're battling with
[1:13:17] long-suffering and patience and
[1:13:19] temperance and godliness brotherly
[1:13:21] kindness that's where the battleground
[1:13:23] is right there and those inhabitants a
[1:13:26] man that's trying to keep you away
[1:13:27] they're hittite stuff amarice and all
[1:13:29] these parasites and you name it is
[1:13:31] trying to keep you from crossing over
[1:13:36] the Giants their Giants but these Giants
[1:13:39] can be destroyed all of the fruits of
[1:13:42] the flesh and the lust of the flesh must
[1:13:44] be destroyed and these are your weapon
[1:13:49] tree this is your weapon tree because
[1:13:51] what all of this leads you into is
[1:13:53] perfect divine love and divine love
[1:13:56] conquers all things all the potential of
[1:14:02] God in us to conquer everything in this
[1:14:04] this time and season is in us and what
[1:14:08] we need to do is learn how to yield to
[1:14:10] it is that right woo look what he said
[1:14:15] to Joshua Joshua twenty-two twenty-four
[1:14:17] six two seven I'm out done he said I
[1:14:19] brought your father's out of Egypt and
[1:14:21] you came unto the sea and they Jibson
[1:14:24] pursued after your father's with
[1:14:25] chariots and horsemen unto the Red Sea
[1:14:28] and when they cried unto the Lord he put
[1:14:30] forth darkness between you and the age
[1:14:36] did you realize I know what what they do
[1:14:39] on that movie but in reality God brought
[1:14:44] darkness so they couldn't even see the
[1:14:46] children of Israel and God put a pillar
[1:14:49] of fire there for the children of Israel
[1:14:51] so they can go across right when they
[1:14:55] got across amen the darkness that the
[1:14:58] light the fire disappeared pretty much
[1:15:00] then the darkness disappeared so they
[1:15:02] figured they can go across there too it
[1:15:04] wasn't wrapped but it was separating the
[1:15:07] darkness separated the light the light
[1:15:10] was separated from the darkness a pillar
[1:15:12] of cloud by day out by night right a
[1:15:15] pillar of cloud by night and a pillar of
[1:15:17] fire by pillar of fire by night a pillar
[1:15:20] of cloud by day so God separated them by
[1:15:24] what darkness and that's what God is
[1:15:27] doing now those who love the darkness
[1:15:30] and those who love light of being
[1:15:34] separated but you are chosen generation
[1:15:38] a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:15:43] peculiar people that ye should show
[1:15:46] forth the praises of him who have called
[1:15:49] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:15:53] light huh which in time past were not a
[1:15:58] people but are now the people of God
[1:16:01] which have not obtained mercy but now
[1:16:04] have obtained mercy
[1:16:06] you know what mercy is you're guilty but
[1:16:12] you got some mercy here and the Bible
[1:16:14] shed its mercy and do it through all
[1:16:16] generation all right one more one more
[1:16:19] give me one more quote out of the sixth
[1:16:21] seal he said the lamb might at any time
[1:16:24] I'm closing with this leave the
[1:16:29] sanctuary up there or the throne of
[1:16:32] sacrifice and come forth from the throne
[1:16:36] of God where the sacrifice left phase
[1:16:38] and then it's over there is no more
[1:16:42] hopes for the world she is finished when
[1:16:47] she goes into frustrations of great
[1:16:50] spasms of earthquakes and great shakings
[1:16:54] as it was at the resurrection as Christ
[1:16:59] rose from the grave when the saints rise
[1:17:01] the same thing would take place Lord it
[1:17:06] could be at any minute we're watching
[1:17:09] for that glad day to arrive now what did
[1:17:12] he just do he just told you at the great
[1:17:16] earthquake there that is the
[1:17:19] resurrection he told you it limit you
[1:17:21] want me to read again as Christ rose
[1:17:25] from the grave when the Saints rise the
[1:17:28] same thing would take place let me back
[1:17:31] it up then she goes to into frustrations
[1:17:35] of great spasms of earthquakes and the
[1:17:38] great shaking like it was at the
[1:17:40] resurrection and as Christ rose from the
[1:17:44] grave when the Saints rise the same
[1:17:47] thing would take place Lord it could be
[1:17:49] at any moment minute we're watching for
[1:17:53] that glad day to arrive
[1:17:57] under the sixth seal he literally tells
[1:18:00] you California earthquake that is tied
[1:18:05] into the resurrection now just notice
[1:18:15] exactly what he did back here now in
[1:18:17] this and I beheld when he opened the
[1:18:20] sixth seal lo there was a great
[1:18:21] earthquake and the Sun became black as
[1:18:24] sackcloth of hair and the moon and the
[1:18:27] moon became as blood blackness darkness
[1:18:30] Egypt blackness darkness God delivering
[1:18:33] Jesus at the cross just before he
[1:18:35] brought him up from the resurrection
[1:18:37] first darkness Sun went down in the
[1:18:41] middle of the day and stars wouldn't
[1:18:43] shine two days from then he was going to
[1:18:46] raise him up with the mighty triumph
[1:18:48] after the Sun and the moon and the stars
[1:18:50] and everything in Egypt all these taking
[1:18:53] place he delivered Israel to the
[1:18:55] promised land see so he showed with it
[1:18:59] with Moses darkness with Jesus darkness
[1:19:03] with us darkness it's got to come let's
[1:19:08] tan but is in that darkness we are born
[1:19:18] that John say come Lord Jesus
[1:19:22] even so combat why I was telling my wife
[1:19:27] I'm not my righteousness ain't mine
[1:19:30] is he is and I believe it I believe him
[1:19:37] because no man was perfect but Jesus
[1:19:40] himself and if he can save the Old
[1:19:43] Testament Saints under a blood covenant
[1:19:48] something that was just a figure to come
[1:19:50] he surely can save us under the real
[1:19:54] blood of Jesus Christ you love the Lord
[1:20:02] oh man like T I'll sing out of so I'll
[1:20:10] sing I love song to Jesus like
