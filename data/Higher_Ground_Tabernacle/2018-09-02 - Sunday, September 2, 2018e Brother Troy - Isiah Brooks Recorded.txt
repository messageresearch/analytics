why we come here amen if he would never speak then why would we come but we're here we're here because he told us we could come here hey man that we could have an expectation that where two or three are gathered in his name they'd be right here in the midst of us hey man they all set us in a certain expectation Amen that we know that when we come we come in his name that we were gathered here in his name that he will meet us here amen so and when he comes was he do he heals he delivers he sets free amen so when he's when he is in the presence of us and we can ask what we will him and he's abiding us we're abiding in him amen let's just Bauer has a word of Prayer before we get into the work Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for this evening father lord I just pray Lord that you just touched my body Lord and and your message might go forth freely father though I pray for the people here the seamy of Loretha you touched them also lower than they might be able to receive your word father Loretha you'd have your your free will this evening father speak whatever you'd want to say Lord or we're all years we're all hearts our hearts are open unto you Father now whatever you might say we'll say yes to it I'll always want to thank you Father for being so kind to us Lord to show up so faithfully father may we show the same faithfulness to you Lord or that you've shown to us father that we would show up Lord ready to hear from you father and we just thank you Lord for all things and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen man let's just get right into the word of the Lord will open our Bibles to the the Book of Luke chapter 1 Luke chapter 1 we'll read from the seventeenth verse a man just want to speak speak a message this evening called the nature of the Lamb amen the lamb does have a nature amen Luke 1 verse 17 says well actually we'll read from the sixteenth verse and it says and many of the children of Israel shall he turned to the Lord their God and he shall go before him and the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord amen now let's go over to revelations chapter 19 amen revelations chapter 19 verse 7 and it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb and he saith unto me these things are the true sayings of God a malicious power has in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we just thank you for these words Lord but pray you would break the bread to the people this evening in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you could be seated amen the Lambs nature you know the lamb has a nature yoen when God created all the animals upon the earth he brought all of them before Adam he said that he did that to see what Adam would name them amen you know you know when Adam started naming all the animals I don't think he was just giving out just the strict name of it Amen but the name is has to do with what the nature of that animal is they own Adams started giving out the names to the animals you know I don't think God was surprised at anything that Adam said because Adam when he began to give the names to the animals God said with his heart that's exactly the same name that I would have given him if I give him the name myself Amen because Adam did exactly what was his father's business amen so when Adam started to name all the animals whatever he spoke what he said was just like what God was said if God was doing himself amen because Adam had received the nature from his father amen so Adam here is in the nature of his father doing his father's business upon the earth just like his father up in heaven would have done a man sewing when Adam started giving out the names to the animals when he came to the lamb he had to draw from something beyond himself to give the lamb that name Amen so when the when because God already had a nature selected for that lamb right so when Adams went out to give the neat give out the name of the lamb he had to draw from something beyond himself to give out because you cannot give out something that you do not have amen you can't give something that you don't have they meant so what Adam had something he had it because a man he had an ability to give out the names of these animals because God gave him that ability Amen so when the lamb nature came forth before him Adam looked at that lamb looked at that nature and he spoke out something prophetic gray man to that animal and he said you will be called the lamb you will be called the Sheep why because there is a certain specific nature that God must have upon the earth a man same thing with the Dove when the Dove came forth before Adam for God to give for Adam to give out the name of the dove Amen God Adam had to prophesy he had to speak out something out of his mouth that didn't come just from the natural flesh of himself but something that came out from his father amen because God had a certain characteristic in that dove that must that must come out Amen that nature had to be upon the earth there had to be doves upon the earth there had to be sheep upon the earth because God was writing a story a man and God had this story selected before the foundation of the world and that story had to be told amens and God had a son upon the earth by the name of Adam that he was going to use that son to prophesy and to speak out over these animals and whatever he said would come to pass amen so when Adam started speaking he starts speaking to the lamb whatever Adam spoke to that lamb was implanted on the DNA of that animal so at the very DNA that animal would reflect down throughout all the generations that animal is still doing today the same characteristics of what I had back then amen but now we now we we people have changed amen we do we don't just live out in the fields anymore or the caves of the earth we you know we build you know ceilings Oh differently than we did six thousand years amen you know on the and the cement and the drywall and all the paints and everything we do things quite a bit different but it's not so with sheep amen the sheep are still bearing wool the same way they bore us six thousand years ago they're still living in the field like they did 6,000 years ago they they're still living the same way they live 6,000 years ago and there's certain characteristics that God put down in there on the inside of those animals and those characteristics are still being lived out today amen so God said but he said remember he's told us that before the foundation of the world that the lamb had a book amen why because God was going to type out his nature as the nature of the lamb right he said that that lamb nature he says I predestinate before the foundation of the world amen and not only is that characteristics there but there but everything now remember the lamb was annoyed the lamb half you when you go into the book of the Book of Revelations it says that the lamb was gonna receive glory they said the lamb was going to open the seals you know the lamb was gonna write the book of life the lamb was going to get married he goes all these characteristics of what the lamb was gonna do there at the end because God says I am I am I am I'm not care I could have characterized myself as the lion and all these things but we got to this part of the Bible he wanted to characterize himself as the lamb and young God everything that God does he does for a reason amen he does it for God knows exactly what he is doing he knew what he was doing when he created the heavens and the earth he knew what he doing when he created us he God has had a very has a drum that he has been writing out a man I'll ask I want to speak on this morning is a characteristics of that lamp amen now now God has prepared everything before we have need of it God prepares it now when we when we are our children God has prepared us to be inquisitive toads who want desire certain things and he gave us those desires as children so that we could grow up amen now if you if you ever see someone who is was just lazy all their life and they don't have any quiz' to him you think there's something wrong with him he'll never amount to what he could be in it throughout all throughout all of his life why because that nature that he needs to have there has to be a drive there has to be a drive and someone to become something greater than you are when you're our child amen and if that drive is missing then then then you will never become what you ought to be could you adjust the thermostat there if anybody's warm amen the lamb nature so in God beforehand has chosen these nature's to speak different things so in so in God you know God had God did create an animal called a hyena but he never chose that to speak about himself God chose a lamp amen you know and when when you think about you know brother Branham he he told he told the story of how you know the Holy Spirit is like a dove and our brother alluded to that this morning you know and when the when the when the when the when you began acting like a wolf and get all snarly then that dove will take off all right because the lamb has to come down to the duck amen if you are not going to act like I don't like act like lamb then how will the Holy Spirit ever come upon you amen when we begin to realize when you first become a Christian you're diving into the Bible you're reading and you're praying and you have all kinds of power amen but as you become a Christian a little bit longer in your life and God begins to remove himself from you for a little bit to see what you'll do and if you don't cling to him amen that all sudden you start losing that lamb like nature a man you have to fight to keep that amen and if you lose the battle and you remember because when you first become a Christian you know it's all you know fairytales and they're the you know it's you got your a lot going on but you but you know and when you first become a Christian you be kind of prideful you know you know because look you know I'm I'm clean I'm forgiving I'm delivered I'm not like I once was and you can you can kind of start getting a little prideful you know you you've shaken off all the things of the world you see someone who is living in the muck and the mire of the world and you just like boy I you know I I'm not like that anymore I've been delivered from all that but they need to become a Christian for a little while longer let the years go on and on and you you and you know it's this you know you know it's more painful then the sins you committed before you're a Christian it's more than the sins you commit after you become a Christian inflict a lot more pain upon you amen why because it's after you become a Christian when you start doing things that are wrong those are the things that really get you down because those are the things that you know I knew better I shouldn't have done this and the longer you are on this Christian on this Christian / journey the more you begin to realize you know you can't really you can't really blame so let's turn over to 1st Corinthians chapter 4 I just wanna explain a little bit from 1st Corinthians first Corinthians chapter four rules three from the fifth verse it says therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and I will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of God and these things brethren have I have I in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo's for your sakes that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is risen that no one of you can be puffed up for one against the other for who make us see differ from another and what has out that thou does not receive now if thou it is receive it why does our glory as if thou did not receive it and weighs saying there if you have something where did you get it amen if you have a certain ability in your Christian life where did you get that from you got a front up up and if you got from above then why can you use that to glory over someone of your brothers or sisters Amen if you have something that you got from God himself then you cannot use that to glory over your brother or your sister Amen no you have to receive the nature of the land Amen now remember the lamb has come to to prepare a bride so that his bride might be ready amen it wasn't that what the spirit of Elijah was sent for he was sent to to prepare a bride for the lamp a man we read over there in Revelations the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready how she make herself ready by submitting herself to the leadership of the lamb amen so the what the lamb is going to get married it's not the Mary he doesn't get married as a lion he gets married as the lamb amen so how does a lamb get married a lamb must marry another lamb amen so if you do not receive that lamb nature then how are you how can you testify that I am part of the Bride of Christ to be part of the Bride of Christ you must receive the nature of the way amen and the nature of the lamb cannot be looking over at your brother or your sister and saying oh look at them oh look at them the lamb no the lamb always looks at themselves amen the the lamb does not look over at someone else the lamb always judges herself first always looks at herself first amen brother Branham he tells a story about a man who had a vision he said they hid the man was he's going to a church and and there was a lot of infighting in the church and people were fighting about this and fighting about that and and everybody had their own opinion and so this man he was he parked the churches way up on top of a hill and he had to park way down here so he as he has climbing the hill up to her the church was he looked and heard something behind him and he turned around and there was a man carrying this huge load up the hill just struggling under the load and he went up to the man he said oh can I can I help you with this load and also he looked down and saw the man had nail scars in his hands he began to realize oh this is a vision and he said can I help you and he said oh are you carrying the sins of the world he said and the man looked at me says no I'm just carrying your sins he says I'm taking your load so you can make it up the hill Amen he wasn't carrying he wasn't burdened with all the sins of the world at that time he was burned with that man since just so that man can make it to church Jesus had to carry that man sins just so he can make it to church and when sometimes we come into this room and we think we're something hey man yo XY's tell him brother Isaiah Allah as tell him brother Isaiah you know last night I was in a terrible mood and I was just I was working on something at the house and I was getting frustrated and and I was this close to losing it amen it's been a long time since I had been that upset and my wife could tell she was like scuse telling me watch it and just guys getting upset I banged my head on something and and I was this close to losing it and my wife looked at me as she knew where I was at she knew I was not in a good place and she looked at me and I just reached over and gave her a hug she helped calm me down a little bit when I had an itch she was there a man by his sill all night long that frustration didn't leak amen and I knew I was preaching this today and I should have come here to prepare but I didn't feel like I was in the right mind to be preparing and so I should've come here to pray anyway but instead of praying I just went to bed and I should have taken care of it that night amen and I didn't do it so when I came in to church this morning I went back there behind the sound booth I knew I wasn't in the right attitude to be in this room and I was just sitting there and I was like I just I was not in the right attitude so I went back to the office I told brother Isaiah because I don't want to waste a service I came here to get something a mint and I don't want to waste a service amen I believe that when two or three are gathered in his name a he'll show up right here in the midst and when we're in this room then I want to be able to to partake of whatever benefit they he has for us Amen so I want her to brother Isaiah's office I said boy I would you pray for me I'm not in my right mind and my brother put his hands upon me he prayed for me and instantly it was gone Amen because I could feel what they myself that that frustration wasn't there was still there and then you know what that was not the Lamb nature amen and when we come into this house into this room we're coming into this room we have to have a lamb nature to get something amen if you don't come in here with a lamb nature you're not getting anything amen we have to have the nature of the land amen because if you don't let me repeat that if you come into this room without the lamb nature how can you have something how can you get something amen as we're here to receive from him now remember lambs are innocent amen a lamb is meek a lamb is gentle a lamb has to be lit a lamb does not speak out but it received whatever is speaking to it amen in gentleness and in quietness it receives from others amen it receives the leadership of the Shepherd Amen right amen and remember what was had the chief Shepherd has his Shepherd stationed here to preach out the gospel and the Lambs gather themselves to hear from the Shepherd that God has chosen amen and in order to see that yet be meek and gentle yourself but when you have your own a puffed up thought of yourself then how can you ever receive from the lamb amen you can't do it amen so in Luke chapter 1 verse 17 God says I sent forth a message I sent forth a message by John the Baptist to prepare a people for the because the Lord's coming amen and the wind and the way has to be made straight so that when the Lord comes that people are prepared beforehand amen how are they prepared beforehand they have to receive the Lamb nature amen and what when when and when John the Baptist saw the Son of God he said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world amen and when he saw that lamb all sudden he saw the Spirit of the God remember God told beforehand when you see the Spirit of God descending like a dove whomever that dubbed the sins upon that is the Lamb of God amen and so when John was looking out over the audience and he saw the Lamb of God descending upon Christ or he saw the dove descending upon Christ he knew that is the Lamb of God amen and he directed everybody I must decrease he must increase go follow that lamb Amen what happens when they followed that lamb they were given power to become the children of that lamb to become lambs themselves a and all of us have been given that power to become lambs of God amen if you don't receive that power then you'll have anything Amen if you do not receive the Lamb nature you don't have anything amai you could think that oh look how many songs I can sing look how much I can worship look how much I can raise my hands look how much I can pray look how spiritual I can look but unless you receive that Lamb nature you don't have thee because the lamb is coming to to receive a wife the land the marriage of the lamb has come his bride has made herself ready how how'd she make herself ready by receiving the nature of the lamb amen and the Spirit of God is still descending amen amen oh I wasn't just for Christ alone the Spirit of God is still descending and he's descending on those that had the lamb nature amen and how do you how do you have to have the lamb nature you have to be just like the lamb say message brother Graham said he went over to a restaurant and and there was a woman there his dress all real nice she has dressed real sweetly and a long dress on and long hair and and and he went to go talk to her and he said oh do you go to life tabernacle there in Shreveport and she said well I do but they won't let me sing on the choir because because I got because they won't let me sing with paint on I got makeup on because they won't let me those people down there they won't let me sing them choir she looked like she had the lamb nature but eschews her mouth opened she she revealed that she didn't have the lamb nature amen as the same thing with us you can look like you have a lamb nature but when you're open up your mouth what comes out is it the nature of a lamb remember a lamb bleats a lamb goes baa baa now what you have to have that sound Amen you have to sound like a lamp if you don't sound like a lamb that you don't have the lamb nature if you don't walk like a lamb you don't have a lamb nature if you don't bear the fruits of a lamb you don't have a lamb nature amai if you don't lay down your life like a lamb then you don't have the lamb nature hey may you see a lot of people to come in to church but they won't lay their lives down that's not the lamb nature how can you come into this room day in day out day in day out week in week out and say oh I am I'm hoping to get something but you never lay your life down then the Holy Spirit will never descend upon me the Holy Spirit can't descend upon that now remember the law the dove and the lamb have a similar nature right they're both innocent they're both white they're both meek they both the one bears the the oil the what other bears lanolin they both keep their their wool they're their coats clean by what they bear amen and they both a they're meek you know that they don't have a Gaul they don't you know they're there they have the same nature the same temperament amen so the one is attracted to the other think about that the one is attracted to the other now how does Christ ever going to be attracted to you until you have the Lamb nature now he died for us while we were yet sinners but he first saw before the foundation of the world that we would have the week he put that nature in there down on the inside as waiting for it to manifest now he has a right to receive what he puts in remember he is the husbandman if he plants the seed he has a right to the fruits after they grow so it what he plants the nature down the inside and he's coming back to receive the fruits from your life a my boy if he comes the past your life and the fruits aren't growing then you're holding out on him amen amen so judge nothing before the time amen because all the hearts will be judged at that day they may think about you knowing you when you uh when you all of us were born in sin you know when you have children and you look at your children and someday when you you know you you're looking at your children and they're fighting and bickering and they're and you ask them something and they always put the blame on somebody else they always put the blame on somebody else you know why because their children they haven't grown up to begin to to realize to look in at the always look at yourselves first amen and Christians always look at themselves first amen that's what Christians do they don't try to blame somebody else Christians because they have a lamb nature they always look at themselves first amen if you'll never get anywhere with Christ if you're always blaming someone else amen you'll never get anywhere in your marriage if you're always blaming your spouse your marriage won't go anywhere amen if you're at your work and you're always blaming your boss your coworker you're never gonna go anywhere your work amen you never get anywhere by blaming somebody else why because you have to have the lamb nature to get anyway amen amen so when you see your children fighting your bickering well they just need to grow up a little bit there's still there's still there once they mature hopefully they'll grow out of that amen they have to receive the lamb nature they have to what do they have to do they have to lay down their life to receive the life that Christ is trying to give them a man so is the same thing in the church the church how does a church ever going to get anywhere because the church had Church can never get anywhere is when the church quits looking at everybody else amen look at yourselves as well I ran said you sweep your steps all sweep mind amen and that's the only way the church can get where is when we all become lambs and receive the lamb nature a man now the Holy Spirit is still here amen II still a dog he's just like when when the Holy Spirit or when the Dove left the ark it was looking for some place to put its foot looking for someone some place to land amen there was only one place in the earth for it they could land and I was on Noah's Ark now where can the Holy Spirit land today can he land upon the Kenny land in Las Vegas he can't land there can he can he land over in New Orleans no he can't land there no work where can the Holy Spirit land the whole earth has become wicked hey work we're just like in the days of Noah a man just like in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah the whole earth has become wicked but the Holy Spirit is still here he's trying to land somewhere where can heal and just like when Jesus was here on the earth he said the foxes have holes the birds have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay his head well the Holy Spirit the the the lamb is looking for some place to lay his head where the head stone has to come down and where can it come down it can only come down upon the Lamb nature amen it has Christ is looking for a place to lay his head stone right amen the the dove is looking for a place to land and when you receive the nature of the Lamb now you're a candidate for the Holy Spirit to Lena amen amen amen like like Jesus said I sank to my I sanctify myself for their sake amen he laid his life down for our sakes we lay our lives down for his sakes amen so he has a place to lay his head amen amen amen he has a lamb's nature a man before the foundation of the world when he no just like Adam he and he was giving forth the names of the animals Christ wrote our names upon the Lamb's Book of Life he wrote down the nature that we would have before the foundation of the world it's already there you all be a better Christian it's already been written it's already there you just have to lay your life down and allow that which was written before the foundation of the world to grow up on the inside of you amen he wrote a book before the foundation of the world he wrote in there exactly what your nature could be hero your full potential amen everything is there you say oh I wish I could be a better Christian well it's already been prophesied before the foundation of the world you just have to lay your life down to receive it Amen and tell you lay your life down you cannot receive what the lamb has for you amen his the bride has made herself ready amen and tell you until you can tell you until you lay your life down you cannot receive what Christ had hey Mel what's the first thing you do and become a Christian you lay your life down in the water a man you die to your old self and you receive the name of Christ upon you and you come up of the water you say knowing or living your life you're living the life of Christ amen and every Christian as a just duty-bound to be able to testify that I am living the life of Christ amen amen a man just to tell upon myself again you know like early on in my marriage I know I've told this testimony before but you know I when my I hate to lose arguments you know and I always had you know certain things I had laid up beforehand so I would never lose an argument you know and if things got heated I could always you know find something that my wife had done wrong in the past then use it against her you know and so I always had these things lined up so if I ever got to the point that I was gonna lose an argument I could just pull from this and beat her over the head with it you know and it worked out for me but didn't work out so good for her that's not the Lamb nature hey man yo and when the Lord filled me with the Holy Ghost he started speaking to me and one day he said to me he said lay down all your ammunition aim and everything that you're using against your spouse I want you to lay it down and you know and I realized I had ammunition I had things that I was using against my wife that whenever the the battle got thick you know whenever the whenever the argument going that I could use I could pull this up out of history and use it against her and God spoke to me he said I want you to lay all that down and it was like well I was using that but I had to lay it down and I had to put it far as the East is from the West amen and you know since that our marriage has grown sweeter and sweeter and sweeter hey man no what caused it I took upon myself the nature of the Lamb I couldn't blame my wife for anything anymore I couldn't hold any things against her anymore think about it isn't that our dream that Christ wouldn't holy thing is to us isn't that our desire of our life is that Christ wouldn't hold anything against us wouldn't we love to get to heaven and walk before him and have him say well done my good and faithful servant and have him not even be able to remember anything we ever done wrong wouldn't that be a blessing wouldn't that be wonderful then we ought to take that same attitude towards our brothers and our sisters a meant that we can't remember the things that they've done wrong that we can forgive them just as much as Christ forgave us then we could take that same forgiveness and pass it on to others amen now you now you can forgive your spouse now you can free of your brother now you can forgive your sister and now you're not holding things against those that are around you amen what I would saw a lot of arguments wouldn't Amen when you when you no longer have anything to argue about well you're not holy thing in your memory where you're not trying to always hold store things up for the future and you just lay all that down now you have nothing what a place what a beautiful place you know it's going to be like that one of these dates we gotta be like that now amen to be the to be the bride of the Lamb in the Millennium right we have to be the bride here amen to be the bride in the future home we have to be the bride right now amen and the bride of what the bride of the lamb his the lamb is coming looking for a bride and he has to find someone with the same nature amen and that's nature has to be in you amen amen we got to be we gotta get you out become good at finding those things they're contrary to that lamb nature identifying those things within ourselves and getting rid of those things a man he's given us the ability to get rid of the way that that nature the nature of the wolf right amen so when in the nature of the wolf rises up within ourselves then we have to draw from the from his nature and say Lord I want that nature of the lame returned to me amen otherwise you know we'll remember Lambs meek lambs are gentle lambs are humble amen and when you have something that's not meek not gentle not humble then you have to go back and repent of those things and draw from the nature of the land amen if you're hoping to be the bride a man is like brother bran said there's a quote I camera exactly how it goes but he says they act like they don't want to be the Bride of Christ they act like they don't want to be the bride all right you know because there's a lot of people that call themselves to be Christians but they act like they're not acting like a lamb and they act like they don't want to be the Bride of Christ they're testifying against that are on their own confession they said they got baptized they said they would submit themselves to the lamb but then they in their actions they won't submit their selves to the lamb so they're testifying that they are not the Bride of Christ mine they're acting like they don't want to be the bride Amen well they gotta get delivered from that Amen remember this is the judgment time this is the time to judge ourselves if you will not judge yourself here how you ever make it up there ami I don't want to preach long tonight but anyway I just wanted to let's turn back over to Revelation so I want to read that one more time here in closing revelations chapter chapter seven sorry revelations chapter 21 verse seven it says he the overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but watch these watch these next two verses here it says but the fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars which shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither and I will show thee the bride the Lambs wife and he carried me away in the spirit and to a great in a high mountain and showed me that great city the holy Jerusalem descending out of God from heaven from God having the glory of God nice talking about us now right anyway he this is describing us having the glory of God and her light was under a stone most precious even as Jessop so clear as crystal and he goes through and he goes through when he describes this city now remember he's talking about us having the glory of God we got to in order to have the glory of God we got to be like the lamb first amen remember when you lay your life down a man it's just like when you if you want to buy something amen if you want to buy something and you hand over your money amen what now remember you know just about anybody if you would love to have ten thousand dollars right you know if the Sun has caught you on the street and to give you ten thousand dollars you'd love to have that why would you love to have it it's not that it's not the paper of the money that gives us joy it's not been Benjamin Franklin's face that brings us joy it's not the something special about the number one hundredths on the hundred dollar bill that we like about it but it's the it's the fact that we can purchase anything that we desire with that right when you have ten thousand dollars you can go to just any store in the town and if yours whatever was inside that store if you want it you could put that money down upon it and you could give up the money that brought you that joy for what you could get out of it right amen and so what is it so Christ lay down his life for us we give up our lives what do we get why we give up our lives for Christ why do we get baptized because we're giving up our life why so we can receive the promise of Christ amen we lay our lives down we receive the Lamb nature so we can receive his nature amen amen the Dove just you know I don't probably remembers the testimony that of brother Dawson Riley he said that he was talking with brother Branham once and brother Branham told him he says you know the Holy Spirit's like a duck and when you do something wrong the Holy Spirit takes his flight and goes and sits upon the on the pond the branch and he is just waiting for you to make it right so he can fly back amen and brother Dawson says I was telling that story to my dad and and he says as I was telling this story he said you know brother bran told me it's just like this that when you we do something wrong that the Holy Spirit's like a dove they he takes his flight and flies up the rent and as he was telling the story he said a dove came and flew up and landed on his shoulder and they all suddenly died he yes he is telling a story the Dove took off and went and landed on a branch and did that three times and his dad says what's going on he says is that yours he says no I never seen that before and he say and he does he finished the story of relating what brother Bennett said to him he said years later his dad was talking to him he said do you remember that time when we were talking about that Dove and that where that Dove came down and he says dad I think about that every day you know and there was something about that story the brother brand gave it to Roller Dawson Riley and as he was telling the story it repeated over again I mean there is something to that story remember now you can even be filled the Holy Ghost and you're all the way down your soul but when you do something you lose all the benefits of the Holy Spirit in your life why because you know you remember we're suppose to have the Holy Spirit what and our soul and in our spirit and on our flesh right all three you're supposed to be filled with the Holy Ghost filled you know they're supposed to be baptized immersed completely immersed a man when you're immersed in something what do you you go down into it and you lose all power over yourself because you're immersed in it and you've come up out of it amen you're immersed in it amen so I'll see you in the baptism of the Holy Ghost fill with the Holy Ghost as he leads us amen but when you go and you do something wrong now you still have him deep down on the inside in your soul you is your faith or unbelief that faith is still there that wasn't so but you lose all the benefits of him upon your flesh and upon your spirit what he takes his flight he's sitting up and they're waiting for you to make it right and when you make it right when you confess your sins it was he do he washes you he is faithful to forgive you then the Holy Spirit can come down and now you have the benefits of the Holy Ghost in your life again a man who would love to have the Holy Ghost with you they're leading you every day oh my you know you know yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen amen as the Lord told brother Brandon says don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never-failing presence of Lord Jesus Christ will be with you everywhere you go hey man that's not just for him that's for you a man this this pillar of fire is not just for brother Branham Amen that pillar of fire he is the firstfruits of that amen that pillar of fire is he as question his answers of someone asks brother BAM what is that pillar of fire that follows you around brother Ram answer he says it's God it's the Holy Ghost not just for me but for every true believer amen they'll submit themselves to Jesus Christ amen that pillar of fire is still here it was on the day of pentecost amen amen the same the same pillar fire the descent upon Jesus Christ amen is the same clarifier this split self up on the day of Pentecost that same clarifier is here to lead you day by day if you have the Lamb nature amen won't you receive him amen day by day make it right confess repent amen so why so the nature of the lamb can lead you amen unless if we don't have that nature we're not going anywhere amen you think about men and women whilst all their Christian walk for years and years and years and the whole time the Holy Spirit is just waiting there for you to make it right and when you get to heaven think about think about having wasted God gives you what 40 years 50 years 60 years 70 years upon this upon this look on this earth and you get to heaven and how many years of your Christian life did you waste while the Holy Spirit was sitting on the branch waiting for you to make it right so he could lead you all over again amen does as jesus said don't you know I ought to be about my father's business but don't you know you ought to be about your father's business amen let's just stand amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I just lord we we know what brother brand said about you is true father Lord and how you can take your flight Lord win when we do something that is wrong father lord I just pray Lord we we don't ever want to let a day go by father where we don't make it right or if they're being by here in this room or under the sound of my voice follow that is holding back from you this not repenting of their sins Lord that that should have that Lamb nature that you testify before the foundation of the world that they would have that Lamb nature but somehow they've allowed the trials of this life to take it away from Lord I pray that you would just be merciful Lord God and lead them to repentance all over again Lord Lord we can't make ourselves repent father or repentance is a gift from You Father Lord and we pray father you just help us Lord to give us that gift of repentance all over again you forgive us of our sins take us the wrong as far as East is from the West Lord that we could have that Lamb nature all over again that Lord because when we when we first came upon this Christian journey Lord that we knew that we were yours and you are ours father that we are the Bride of Christ Lord and but lord house the things upon life's journey sometimes can knock us down Lord we pray father that we don't want us to take a year after year after year of wasting the life that you have given us father Lord and failing to repent Lord we pray Lord may we make it right quickly lo if there's anything we've done wrong Lord reveal it to us Lord convict us Lord and we'll make it right quickly father and Lord we just thank you father forgiveness repentance for allowing us to have the Lamb nature and I pray Lord that you'd show us the way back quickly and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen remember when people start repenting God shows up on the scene amen remember everywhere viable always starts with repentance amen when people remember you can't you can't be sorry for your sins by yourself that's a gift from God amen you know if God did not bring repentance back to us we would just go on in his judgment they meant but it's a gift of God amen if you if you are not sorry for your sins then you got to cry out for God for repentance and that may be per chance that he might allow you to come back to repentance amen because we can't make ourselves sorry amen that's a gift that is a gift sorrow godly sorrow over your sins as a gift and if you lose that godly sorrow because you go wrong day after day after day against what the leadership the Holy Ghost is uuuugh sear your conscience with a hot iron amen and then how can you ever come back to repentance it will take a gift of God to bring you back to that amen but if you but if you humble yourself and you repent God is faithful Amen was he doing he first brings you back to that sorrow Amen he has the first step he has to bring you back to being sorry for your sins if you don't have that sorrow you got to cry out for it amen gumpa see brother if you'd come so we're gonna have to do it another service my apology toward you but I hadn't heard brother Troy preach in a while and I had to make the choice either go get the bread of mr. preaching so I determined I was going hear the preaching because we could always do communion of another day but we appreciate the Word of God I was a blessing to us and then trying to keep and keeping that lamb nature and when we see that lamb nature get away from us we need to cry out for repentance because that's the only way you climb the stair like I try to tell people I said we got to understand that Jacob's Ladder is a yielding you know I mean anytime you have to climb something it's a work to you know you don't climb stairs like like you know like you flying you know it takes a little more more energy going up and down so we thank God for the victory I was thinking about when he was preaching how brother branham you know when he lied to the there was the the the tax rataxes yeah people and you know told his wife say tell him tell him I'm not here and sure enough she said brother bill bill you that wasn't quite right was it and then the phone rang and he had to pray for someone he couldn't pray for that baby matter of fact that the Holy Spirit call him a hypocrite say you hypocrite right so he had to go make things before he could preach before he could pray for the baby that's what I brother the Lord was speaking tonight you know when sin is there it doesn't take the Holy Ghost from because the prophet of God had the Holy Ghost in his soul but the Holy Spirit moved right over here and he lost the benefits see that's when we become powerless not that we don't have power inside but we lose the benefits of praying and doing the things that we normally would do because we need to make things right and as soon as we repent and get things right with God the nature of God comes back on us and then you know all the benefits come with the return of the Holy Spirit that was a powerful I mean I've I got a lot of notes in my mind then one time I preached on the Lamb's Book of Life but now I got some extra stuff huh brother joy no we win once it's out it's no longer here so we paint pop oh it's great stay with me whenever preacher comment some good stuff come there's no longer his you know but we appreciate the Lord we appreciate your coming and my apology once again that because we wouldn't want people having communion it was my fault I've been so busy so many things in my head going on and it just slipped up on me so we thank you Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me [Music] was blind but now praise God I see twas grace that taught my heart to be angry [Music] how precious did that grace appear the hour Billy through many dangers toils and seek our case praise has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me [Music] when we ride shiny wave no less days to sing God's praise then we praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise the amazing grazing Amazing Grace how sweet that wretch like me was blind but not praise God I see a man thank you [Music]
