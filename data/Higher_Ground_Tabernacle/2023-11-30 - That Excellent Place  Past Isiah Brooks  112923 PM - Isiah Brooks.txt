Light hallelujah praise the Lord I Saw The Light we're glad to be here tonight God is so good to us amen we thank God for his goodness his mercy and Grace amen you love the Lord we appreciate God you know that he is doing you may be seated I just have something that's heavy on my heart we are all striving for Perfection and I I personally uh desire to make a rapture but I I want to say by the grace of God in all of my efforts we all have our struggles uh I'm not a perfect man but I'm pressing toward being perfect I have a desire that I have of you uh we all desire each other's prayers many of us have things that we must overcome I was listening to the message on the token and one of the things that I did learn is that you could be truly sealed by the Holy Ghost still yet be backsliding I thought that in order to be sealed after being sealed you could never backslide but brother BR said you can still be sealed with the Holy Ghost I'm saying this to you all not just for you but for me uh because Satan has been doing some tricks with me and I have found myself in a place that I thought I never would be now my my my thought thought is this I'm always preaching against uh uh internet stuff and all of that kind of crazy stuff it's so easy to be pulled into things watching pictures all of those things you know I I I meant to start in a different place but I'll come to what I'm getting ready to say we have in this day all hell working against us and if we're not watchful will be pulled into something a habit of some sort that is it to take God to to to take us out of it and the reason why I say this is because I had a an app on my phone if anybody know anything about Pinterest Pinterest is where you can food and all kind of stuff on it and and just in a moment's time I hit something that I should not have and and and and I'm saying this because I don't ever want that to ever happen again and I need your prayers um most ministers wouldn't preach or tell you about these things but I have nothing to hide and I know one day I've got to face God and everything that's done in the dark will be brought to the light I'll say this I know that there is a spirit of Witchcraft that's fighting this church and trying to fight me and my wife and the reason why I say this the other night when we came home there was a h black tomat on my porch on my porch and tried to frighten my wife if you know my stairs if she had been frightened enough she would have fallen backwards we rebuked that cat and it was a big one the last time I saw a cat like that it was about four or five cats around this witch it was a male witch I know what I'm talking about and then a few days later I was in my kitchen and I saw this black cat in my kitchen but it was in spirit form this time so I rebuked it I'm not afraid of Witchcraft I'm covered by the blood you understand me I know who I am and I know where I'm headed but I I also also understand why I've had these strange impulses to do things that is not common to a Christian that God has kept me but now I understand what's happening so I'm telling you if strange things start happening and you know it's out of your character understand there is a spirit that's trying to defeat you recognize what you're working with so I'm saying all of these things I desire your prayers and I'm going to pray for you as well but I had to say all of these things because I know what Satan is trying to do I have been praying for a Revival for this church and he's pulling out everything he can to keep this revival from happening is that right because I must be first partaker that's the way it's ordained I must be first partaker and if Satan can get me he got the rest of everybody else and it's not my desire to cause anybody to stumble or fall and most of all I definitely don't want to fall so keep me keep me in your prayers he figure if he can't get me naturally he'll try to get me spiritually but I have I have confidence in God he is The Keeper of the Soul he he said uh that he would keep that which I have committed unto Hallelujah you love the Lord I trust I helped somebody with something my whole point is if there's any attachment that you have in the world any kind of attachment leave it alone because Satan will use it as a weapon against your soul you understand me everybody understand me stand I could have caught the uh the film off but I thought that if there be anybody listening that is not here I wanted them to hear what I had to say because I don't want my prayers to be hindered Hallelujah and I am definitely not one that's willing to live as a hypocrite I told the Lord before he saved me if I can't be a genuine Christian I don't want to be one at all hallelujah hallelujah Hebrews 11 56 and then we'll go from there to Genesis 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for his translation before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is rewarder of them that diligently seek hallelujah hallelujah Genesis 5:24 and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him let us pray father God we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your Amazing Grace thank you for the experience uh that you gave me last night I don't fully understand it I cannot explain it but I do know it was you it was one of the sweetest experience I have ever encountered as a Christian I really thought I was in heaven and I show thank you Father for that experience even though when I awake I was disappointed to know I was still here God I I wish I could remember it all but somehow I don't know how and wouldn't even know how to express in the English language what you allowed me to experience thank you for the Honey in the Rock thank you for that Revelation thank you for that experience and I pray father God what you gave me is the beginning of great Revival in this church help me Father be faithful and obedience to all of your word in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated my subject tonight is that excellent place and that word excellent means extremely good very good superb outstanding magnificent of high quality I I don't know no other words to express Excellence but when I say the word excellent It's equivalent to perfect or if there was a same more perfect higher than perfection and and and this is the uh experience I believe that God wants to give all of us we know that we're living in that time uh where of Enoch I can preach about Noah I can preach about s the other part that that doesn't that's not us we we talking about Enoch the one that was translated um you know the way the Bible is written we may even think that Enoch didn't have no troubles but everything that Noah dealt with Enoch had to deal with for whatever reason we we think that this some this is what what we are experiencing today is something new but Solomon says there is no new thing under the Sun what we are now experiencing is has always been but I want you to understand Enoch one out of all the world I'm not even including Noah in hisou but one out of all the world had the ability to walk with God and God didn't didn't just lay that in the records for us just to read but he wanted us to see the kind of opposition that we would be facing in this last day hallelujah hallelujah there are only a few Christians and I'm not talking about message people I'm talking about Christians that have moved from the the the the element of Science and programs and popularity because it's not a popular thing to be a Christian hallelujah hallelujah when you are a Christian you have to walk alone hallelujah hallelujah your mind is not even your mind your mind is the mind of God and so what you see things in the way that God see things and you react in the way God reacts you walk like God you talk like God because you are God In the Flesh in your day Hallelujah now we are in that age of translation and I don't want anybody to forget it Hallelujah this is the age that God promised us that we would change from Mortal to immortality Hallelujah it is the devil's job to make you luk warm it is the devil's job to take your focus Hallelujah away from the word of God but this is the age that the word the word must become flesh and the flesh must become the word hallelujah the one thing I love about it is because this age is the age of Promise y'all hear what I'm saying this age is the age of Promise it's not him that will it no he that run it but it's God who shows the mercy this is cause doing it's not my doing it's not your doing is God's doing God chose you God chose me Hallelujah in these last days hallelujah and to walk with God in this day means to walk with God as an individual Enoch does not represent a group hallelujah hallelujah is that right you don't you don't get a group rate to get to heaven Hallelujah this is an individual walk with God hallelujah each person to themselves so I can't be looking at you and allow you to affect my walk with God hallelujah is that right I can't look to the left but I can't look to the right I must keep my eyes FOC you you hear what I'm saying because I'm going to tell you something one of the things that Satan does it CS us to look at each other and by doing so if we see somebody weak weakens us but that's the effect that Satan wants Hallelujah but you got to see yourself as one hallelujah amen you have to see yourself as the church not collectively as one Hallelujah because Enoch was that oneall that's the truth brother brand said you can count the number of people on one hand in this age that will make the Rapture but what about all the message people you understand understand me so he said what you must do is liken yourself as that one if it's going to be five I'm one of the five Hallelujah yes see the flesh will become the word that means this flesh Must Die the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Must Die daily hallelujah hallelujah what we fail to see is that there is a resurrection every day of this old man because you killed him yesterday doesn't mean he's not going to rise today you got to kill him today all day Hallelujah it is a constant battle where the devil defeats us we take our eyes off Jesus once we take once we take our eyes off him he knows he's got us positionally right where he wants us to be is that right I me he use a little small story Hallelujah like Peter walking on the water but as soon as Peter began to look around at his what troubles at the waves and the winds and the doctrines and all the things of the message Hallelujah when he began to look around he began to sing because he kept he he he he stops looking at the word and you must look in the word every day Hallelujah is that right you must seek the word seek God in the word every day and I can ask you to raise your hand but I'm not how many of you seek him every day hallelujah hallelujah this in itself is the working of the Holy Spirit as I said it's not by might it's not by power but it's by the spirit says the Lord this word this message is a Wonder can you imagine how those people people felt when Jesus called Lazarus and he walked out of the Tomb it was a wonder it was something that the Mind couldn't compreh now knowing me you know if I wasn't converted if I had seen something like that I probably would have fainted off probably would got I would have for me I should laugh but the truth of the matter is the fear of it would have overtaken me but you could see that the people's hearts was so darkened in that day that after Lazarus was risen from the dead they tried to kill him they tried to kill him is that not what happened in our day Mal with all of the Wonders that God did in his ministry and this United States tried to kill him hallelujah hallelujah but one thing you can't stop and that is election hallelujah hallelujah there's always going to be somebody that's going to believe and somebody that's going to be drawn to the truth no matter what Hallelujah I I I I tell you what I get excited because I truly believe in the Supernatural my mother was a true Pentecostal woman full of the Holy Ghost and I saw a lot of Supernatural in her life wasn't just her life it was my life too cuz I I was included so I came to know God was real Hallelujah even before I became what I called it became Christian Hallelujah now I've seen where brother bam said you and I could live so close to God that God will take you places oh yes I believe that and and that's not that's not waiting for the Rapture Hallelujah did did God take philli somewhere the Bible tells us that philli was translated Hallelujah that's the truth and we don't know a a lot of things we don't understand hallelujah hallelujah you think about John come out of Wonder they tried to kill him boil him in oil that's the same God that's the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and one day what happened to John may become a strength to you because the persecution is coming Hallelujah right now they're persecuting Christians all over the world Hallelujah yes sir but Paul had a visitation to the Unseen World I like to say like this it was like a taste of the Rapture just a for Taste of the Rapture 2 Corinthians 12 beginning at the the second verse I I I want to live like that I want to live I want to be I want to have that token life and brother said with that token life you have a right to your healing to deliverances to Miracles you have a right he said when you apply the token with prayer he said God will work on your behalf and I'm saying people look at the number of Christians in here with all of us saying we have the token can you imagine if we bind or combine our faith Hallelujah in this uh Desiring of Revival in here God will wipe out every devil every stronghold will be broken I believe that Hallelujah we as a church must come together with that this is why Satan fighting you so much in your mind making you think you're not worthy of anything but you'll never be worthy he made you worthy take what God has promised you take it and claim it and work with it that's what the token gives you hallelujah hallelujah glory to God second Corinthians 12 2-7 Paul says I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago where in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God know it such a one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to UT of such a one will I Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in my infirmities is that right for though I would desire the glory I should not be a fool but I will say the truth but now I forbear L any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he Hearth of me hallelujah what was Paul saying I don't want no glory what has happened to me God gave it to me Hallelujah now you you you you I talked about brother Bosworth the last message brother Bosworth was a real Christian and for hours he shook hands with his loved ones before he died hey somebody help me here y'all hear me he testified that the land was theread Hallelujah brother Brandon was caught up behind the curtain of time and he testified that the land was there hallelujah hallelujah we have so great a cloud of witnesses the land is there and it's worth fighting for y'all better hear what I'm saying it's worth the suffering hallelujah it's worth the living it's worth this dying it's worth the crying I know it's worth it to make Heaven my home Hallelujah but you know what I want to see and I trust that my desire is not vain it's not car want people to see Jesus in this church not just in me but I want Jesus be seen in you Hallelujah and I mean the supernatural God in the women as well as the men hallelujah amen that people in this de MO area will know that Jesus is in this place Hallelujah I don't want to be just a church another denomination we are we are moving in a way that we will be the body of Christ the housing of the almighty God the Living God tabling in human flesh this is where this message is taking us that's our Promised Land Heaven is not our promised land this is our Promised Land Hallelujah and this Promised Land will be changed from Mortal to Immortal Hallelujah God promised he Chang us hallelujah God promised that death will be swallowed up in Victory hallelujah hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying unless I should be exalted he said seventh verse Hallelujah exalted above Mar through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh messenger of sat to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above me and brother Bram said it was more than likely his eye because when that pfy struck him he he lost his sight and and and he always had that little you know runny eye type thing Hallelujah and that's why you find in the scripture Paul says un the uh some of the followers you saw me as Jesus Christ himself and some of you would have given plucked out your own eye to give him to me Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying the man was so full of God people saw him as Jesus Christ himself did not that happen to William Brandon they saw so much God so so you see it the why people do what they do but see they took their eyes off of all that that's what Paul said I'm not trying to be exalted I'm not trying to exalt myself it's not I that lives but it's Christ that lives in me hallelujah hallelujah and that's where we must come to to the very fact that we are truly dead and I don't mean halfway dead I don't mean 99% I mean 100% dead so that Christ can live through us but that's the fight that you're going to have to fight and you're going to have to win it and how you must win it you must win it because without the token there is no Resurrection for you hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't matter how much Church you go to how faithful you are with your tithing of whatever the case may be he says when I see the blood I will pass over you hallelujah hallelujah I'm so glad that I am of the Lord and you ought to be glad too that you're not your own Hallelujah I I am owned by God you owned by God is that right the Bible say you bought with a price Hallelujah that's right First Corinthians 6 hallelujah hallelujah I want to be completely free if I should die now I don't want no trouble at the river you understand what I'm saying and you never know when death is going to strike doesn't make any when you're young or old Satan don't care and the devil doesn't but when you're free you like Bosworth say I cannot die I died a long time ago y hear what I'm saying this is the moment I've been waiting for hallelu oh my God yes sir you you know what disturbs me I don't know those of you who have the Holy Ghost you remember when you first got it nobody couldn't stop your mouth all you could do was praise God you didn't care who heard you didn't care whether they like it or not and I'm concerned because the fire that we once had is no longer there and I'm not saying you don't have it I believe the Revival is what we need and that Revival is not shouting and dancing it's just getting all the trash out of your life but most of us we fear other people because we might think that our sins our our shortcomings it's worse than anybody else I'm here to tell you you're in the flesh am You're In the Flesh and your flesh is no better than mine and the Very things I fight you fight too Hallelujah is true there is no great sin and no no one better than the other the Bible said even if you break the word of God in one place of them all we don't need religion we salvation Hallelujah and salvation sets you free it takes you from under the Creed and dos of men it keeps you from being imprisoned by men Hallelujah is that right you think about what Peter did Peter scorned scorned or Sean the Galatians separated himself from because they were gentille and he was a Jew just just that little bit of prejudice and Paul rebuked him Barnabas and everybody else that followed that nonsense Hallelujah hey let me tell you something God don't care in this age you could have been birthed by a prostitute God don't care how you were born if the seed of God is in you that's all that matters the blood prevails y'all hear what I'm saying so you got to understand when Paul rebuked him he said that kind of prejudice literally takes away from the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Gospel of Jesus Christ there's not man nor feale Gentile nor Jew Hallelujah We Are One in Christ I'm so glad to be on by God yeah I'm his possession Hallelujah he's mine and I'm here I don't have to worry about being taken care of he's a perfectionist understand so when he see something wrong with me he's going fix it you know what I'm saying he's going to fix it first Corinthians 6 19 what know ye not that your body is the Temple of which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for We Are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body this is how we glorify we glorify God in this body by being obedient to his Spirit glorify God in this body and in your spirit which are God's amen we we give right to our body to him but in reality he's the maker of the body so we really don't own nothing everything about us is his my mind is his that's why the Bible says love the Lord God with all your mind with all your soul with all your being because everything belongs to him Hallelujah is that the truth and let me say it like this this excellent place I'm so glad to be in this place I couldn't have paid my way in this was given to me Hallelujah this was given to you whosoever will let him come you can come into this place this is an excellent place to be Hallelujah because when you see me you don't see me you see him Hallelujah this is an excellent place to be hallelujah what are you saying Brother Bruce I'm saying I am now you are now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I'm going to praise His name I'm going to worship him I'm going to thank him I'm going to give him glor Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah because I am a Overcomer you are Overcomer why because he made you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah think about it there is no way you can defeat the Devil amen the the devil first of all has already been defeated all you can do is trust the Lord Jesus in him be clothed in him let him be your Hiding Place what are you saying when you make a mistake recognize that God doesn't see it because you're covered by the blood y'all better hear what I'm saying and God knows he's already forgiven you before you even ask him to forgive you is that the right the Bible said he hears you before you call hallelu hallelujah hallelujah but we walk in this life like we Sinners and we're not sinners we're Sinners saved by grace y'all better hear me but I'm not wearing on my back sin Sav by Grace I'm not even wearing that on my chest you know if there be a emblem if there be a wording on my chest you know what it will say Jesus Christ Lord amen yes amen amen you understand what I mean I once was a sinner saved by grace but now you're no longer a sinner unless that's what you want to be you either a saint or and you can't be a sinner Saint or Saint sin you got to be one or the other and I have been promoted from being a sinner because a sinner is a unbeliever Hallelujah and there was one time I didn't believe but now I am a believer I'm not a make believer I'm not an unbeliever I am a believer so therefore I'm no longer a sinner a sinner is someone who is born in sin Hallelujah but when you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you're no longer a sinner and when God gives you the Holy Ghost it moves you from there saood hallelujah hallelujah and Paul in the Romans 8th chapter hallelujah hallelujah Romans 8 I love this my brother kept saying what shall separate you but the Bible don't say what he said who shall sep separate us from the love of because who you can put the devil in there Satan himself he's a person who can't separate me can't separate you from the love of Christ Hallelujah is that right he say shall tribulation now is what distress persecution famine nakedness Peril or S Hallelujah hallu that who can go back to the devil that who was the one who separated even anim Hallelujah and right now through tribulation Andress persecution famine nakedness and Peril and sword he said we are invincible we are invincible Satan pulled out all he can pull Paul experienced it Hallelujah and the Christ that was in brought him through all of this Paul had tribulation Paul had distress Paul had persecution was naked Paul had famine he had perils on the sea he faced the sword he cut his head off he left at Satan he laugh at death oh death where is your St oh great what was it he was in an excellent place Hallelujah he was in an excellent place he was in a place where Satan couldn't touch him Hallelujah is that right how can you die how can you die when you living in youron right now is under the altar Hallelujah in the curtain behind the curtain of time that's where that body that one day you're going to unite with is there Paul said if this Earthly Tabernacle be disol have a building I got one waiting on me is that right and God was so gracious to this church to this group of people he had an astronaut that was able to travel through dmensions beyond the curtain of time he said I saw you there I don't know about you but I'm one in the million Hallelujah an excellent place to be hiding in that rock I'm hiding in the Rock of Ages y'all hear me I'm hiding in the Rock the Bible said the name of the Lord is a strong strong tower and the righteous run in and they are sa I'm hi in the name of Jesus I have no power of my own but I'm hiding in the name of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah what about his name the Bible say at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess what are you saying brother his name is my name my name is his name I didn't adopt his name he gave it to me when he adopted me Hallelujah he gave it to you when he adopted you use your name use your token put Faith behind the word of God hallelujah don't be afraid to fail don't be afraid of failure Hallelujah we make mistakes but the Bible say the just man will fall seven times in the day how many of you have gotten up sometimes you don't even know how you got up but you got up Hallelujah say kick you down and you got up anyway he punched you but you got up anyway you took the licks and you was ready for more Hallelujah one thing about the Bride of Jesus Christ can't quit hallu you know why cuz he's holding you you're not holding God they said Hold on you're not holding on he's holding on to you Hallelujah let me move on hallelujah hallelujah as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter Hallelujah nay in all things wait a minute you believe this nay in all things we are more than conquer to him that loves us hey do y'all believe that oh we just go around I've done it before I'm a loser I've done it maybe I've not said it but I had that that atmosphere around I'm a failure but that's not the word it's when you looking at yourself you are a loser you are a failure but if you're looking at Jesus Christ who is the mighty conqueror you can never be a loser you can never be a failure Hallelujah Paul says we're more than conference to him that loved us hallelujah I'm more than a conqueror Satan you need to hear this more than coner Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah through him that loved us that's what I like about it he loved us not through him because we loved him but because he loved us hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said he even chasen Those whom he Lov thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no in all things we are more than conquerors through him that love us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels not principalities nor power nor things present hello nor powers so if you are in a situation and it seems like you're powerless the word of God said that power has no power Hallelujah nothing can hold you if you want to be free God will set you free Hallelujah nor things present nor things to come nor height nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our love yall understand me he we love him because he first love us it is his love that toward us that keeps us that sustains us that protects us that leads us and guides us hallelujah listen there is no there is only one eternal life and one eternal life give bir Hallelujah I'm almost at the end Hallelujah according to leadership paragraph 58 brother B said your priest Your Leader or so forth can teach you your religion you can learn the message that that we are trying to teach still that won't give you eternal life you you got to accept the person Jesus Christ you know there are so many Christians even in this message that have never accepted the Lord Jesus Christ You' never said according to Romans 10:9 Lord I I I accept you as my savior I accept you as my personal Savi I mean from the heart I am a sinner that needs to be saved God I need you help me Lord and if this this be true which I believe is true become my not not only just my savior if you do that in really mean it a change will happen at that moment not tomorrow that moment because he desire to save you more than you want to be amen hallah you understand that people say well I accept the message but you never went to Calvary you got to go to Calvary you got to go to Calvary amen hallelujah hallelujah you understand that all of you got to accept the person Jesus Christ to have eternal life now but sometimes other leaders get so much influence on on us until we don't know what to do then when that that time comes you see you got to accept the Lord Jesus you got to get over him on your needs somewhere but your heart must be in it it can't be your head it's got to be your heart hallelujah hallelujah yes sir true see you you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by God another thing is a seal is a security seal means you are secure now you that don't believe in eternal security I don't know see but now but a seal signifies security to its destination and wo unto that guy that would try to break that seal and the holy go Holy Spirit cannot be broken hallelujah hallelujah now now I'm almost done just just let me let me uh the Bible says that uh Hebrews 11:4 you don't have to turn there but it talks about Abel having a more excellent and brother Bram says that the blood speaks you know every time somebody is healed in the name of Jesus that's the blood speak when somebody is delivered in the name of Jesus that is the blood speak hallelujah hallelujah you you love the Lord yes coming from this message token begin at the 122 I'm almost done he said what we what we need today is another baptism of the Holy Spirit and have the real power of God that identifies the works that Jesus Christ promised for this day you see what I'm saying I believe that Christians and we run to the doctor too much back in the day the church was the hospital that's why he said if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover but we don't even go there we don't even consider God anymore what I'm trying to say is something wrong something has been broken now I'm not trying to tell you to manua something I'm saying you got to get more of see we get more of God it won't we won't manufacture nothing it will happen supernaturally natural is that right it will be it just not even thinking about it it will be I can't help but think about when Peter and them were thrown in jail andur Church got together praying and God rocked the jail house I believe in that God I believe in that God hallelujah hallelujah and taba thought it was a ghost when she saw Peter God had answered that prayer so quickly it was a wonder how could this happen but you see when you have faith and you have and you come on one Accord that's the problem we are so selfish we don't come together on one Accord and we need to we need each other that's right we need each other and we'll be surprised on what we'll see God do come together when somebody's in trouble when somebody needs aob job anything that's whatsoever you will and it shall be given that's the Bible but we'll let each other suffer cuz it it's not us personally the body works together hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to start this over what we need today is another baptism of the Holy Spirit and have the real power of God that testifies the work that Jesus Christ pris for this day not so much as that day this day the promise that he made here that was what he promised there he will pour out his Spirit now he promised it a gain in the last days and what he was doing now we we didn't see Enoch but but we saw the same God working through Malachi fall hallelujah hallelujah and Enoch must have had the same ability because the Alpha and the Omega y hear what I'm saying and you got to recognize that Malachi 4 tyed out almost all the prophets you can see him in there hallelujah hallelujah he was the winding up the of the word bringing it all together that's what he was we saw Moses we saw Elijah I mean we we just saw so many things and my point is this when the seals were open the prophet of God said it put us back in the Garden of Eden before the fall I believe that so we have an anointing that God wants us to move into but that comes by obedience you can't get there without obedience it comes by obedience because disobedience is what took us out so obedience will take us in and and and and and Adam had the ability to create to move things around Hallelujah he literally had the mind of God and people that's where God wants us to be and that's a promise to the bride she will be the word she is the word hallelujah hallelujah and I don't know about you but that's what I'm striving and I know if I could just continue to humble myself I'll get there Hallelujah strange that we can always look back but you never look ahead that's the way with man he's always saying glorifying God for what he did did do praising him for what he is going to do and ignoring what he is doing that's always the way of man it's still the same way and he goes on to say full obedience to the word brings God the word Eternal in you and that is the token when the word is in you is Christ in you now notice when when then when we pray if we have the token when we pray we have the token or present our token with our prayer now if you sick if you a sinner in need when you have the token you have a right if I had the token to a a bus line in my in my hand they can't keep me off that bus they have accepted my money and I have the token in this case I could not pay my price you could not pay it but he paid it for us and gives us a token I have a right to Divine Healing see Jesus Christ died that I could have Divine Healing I have a right to claim every promise in the book when you get it when you have the token and can represent the token with your prayer if you haven't got it the sign of the full obedience the fair is paid Hallelujah Paul tells us the blood speaks the blood speaks did we say does Paul the blood speak Hallelujah can you speak the token speaks yes sir yes sir absolutely no yes sir absolutely no hallelujah hallelujah I'm just going to can you give me one more yeah not oh my God God is so good to us coming from the message thirst but see to neglect The Thirst if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or you will die if you neglect that thirst in you for God you will spiritually die you call for Revival you wait for your church to a Revival well that ain't that ain't the Revival for you the Revival ought to begin right in when you began to thirst for God did y'all hear that when you began to thirst for God that's your Revival that's your beginning hallelujah hallelujah there might not be another member of the church way wanting that Revival if it breaks out in you it will break out other places see but you neglect that thirst you neglect to Milk The Cow when the cow when the other is full of milk and if you let that cow stay like that she'll go dry that's exactly right if you neglect a drink of water say I just ain't going to drink anymore you will die neglect to eat you will die and if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the word of God y'all hear me that's why you got to read your Bible you got to listen to the message if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the word of God you you Christians you Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecost Assemblies of God oness Tess whatever you are see don't care that don't matter nothing to me I don't think it does to God you an individuals you a unit you'll never go to heaven as a church a denomination you go to heaven as one single person between you and God that's all don't care what your church belongs to if you neglect to read the Bible and to believe the Bible and the Holy Spirit feed upon that you will die Jesus said in St John 4 to3 the Scripture it right now Jesus said man should not live by bre alone but by every word not just part of okay one more and I'm going let you go this is this is really good to me Hallelujah but this is a this is one of the one of the things I want you to see this is the end of the message and this this this is coming from three kinds of Believers coming from paragraph 295 he said when I was in the realm of the lost I scream oh God don't never let a person come here you can't there is no tongue and describe to you what the horrors of it is there is no way for me to tell you if you believe that there is a burning hell full of Fire Brimstone that would be a cool Shady Green pasture to deci of what horrors of this lost condition was in and the misery that it is that is associated that place and if I tried to speak to you of things that would be Beyond human understanding I still couldn't describe the place of the blessing peaceful never to die never to be old never to be sick always to be young always to be healthy never to die eternal life in the blessing of Youth and no sin or nothing else oh there is just no way to describe it y'all hear what he's saying there's no place no way to describe hell he said that region is undescribable and he said a burning hell will be a cool place can even compare it y understand what I you read what I read he said whatever you do don't go there oh Lord he said but even St Paul he said ey have not seen ears have not heard nor has even entered the heart of man you can't even understand it there is no way to explain it what God has for them that what love him and now as this is ass surely true here and in the individual indiv in invisible audience we are pictured here tonight in one of these classes either we are genuine belever test is with the word if the word says a certain thing and the church says something different what would you take look in the glass of God's word and see which class you're standing in if you're not tonight both here in the invisible a if you're not if you're not with the believing type offer just a word of prayer for you now that you would come into that believing TI that's what we want we want to be among the Believers let's to be like Jesus to be like Jes on Earth I long to be like him
