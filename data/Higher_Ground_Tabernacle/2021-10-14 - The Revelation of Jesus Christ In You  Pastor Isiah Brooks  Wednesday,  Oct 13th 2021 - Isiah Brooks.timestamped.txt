[17:04] you know i remember the last time i
[17:06] encouraged somebody to come out it was
[17:07] not so nice
[17:10] so
[17:12] i'm very careful about that especially
[17:14] when somebody is sick or in in trouble
[17:16] by god's grace ephesians 4 15
[17:28] everybody there
[17:34] yeah i don't know what about
[17:39] 4 15
[17:41] but speaking the truth in love
[17:44] may grow up into him
[17:46] in all things
[17:48] which is the head
[17:51] even
[17:52] christ
[17:53] from whom the whole body fitly
[17:57] joined together
[17:58] compacted
[18:00] by that
[18:01] which every joint supply
[18:05] according to the effectual
[18:08] working
[18:09] in the measure of every part
[18:12] making increase of the body
[18:14] unto the edifying of itself
[18:18] in love amen
[18:20] one more scripture
[18:25] let's go to first corinthians
[18:28] 13th chapter i believe that's correct
[18:34] oh god help us
[18:38] i trust everybody is doing well
[18:42] it really rained
[18:43] heavily last night
[18:53] yes
[18:54] first corinthians 13 and we're going to
[18:56] begin at the eighth verse
[19:07] we'll begin reading
[19:08] charity never faileth
[19:12] but whether there be prophecy
[19:14] they shall fail
[19:16] whether there be tongues they shall
[19:18] cease
[19:19] whether there be knowledge it shall
[19:21] vanish away
[19:23] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[19:26] part
[19:27] but when that which is perfect is come
[19:31] then that which is in part shall be done
[19:33] away
[19:35] when i was a child i spaked as a child i
[19:38] understood as a child i thought as a
[19:41] child but when i became a man i put away
[19:45] childish things
[19:48] for now we see through a glass darkly
[19:51] but then face to face amen now i know in
[19:54] part
[19:56] but then shall i know even as i am known
[19:59] amen
[20:01] and now abideth faith
[20:03] hope charity
[20:04] these three but the greatest of these
[20:08] is charity amen
[20:10] let us pray
[20:13] our heavenly father we come before you
[20:16] and we thank you for your grace and your
[20:18] mercy
[20:20] we thank you for being so good to us
[20:22] because you have been better to us than
[20:24] we've been to ourselves
[20:26] lord i just want to just say thank you
[20:29] for your amazing grace
[20:31] thank you for your gift of love thank
[20:34] you for that love that so past surpasses
[20:37] all of our understanding
[20:39] lord i know that in my soul
[20:42] i desire to be just like you
[20:45] and i have confidence in your word
[20:48] because you said
[20:49] he that begun the good work in us
[20:52] is faithful to complete it amen
[20:55] by power
[20:56] it's not by light
[20:58] but it's by your holy spirit
[21:00] and we thank you lord in jesus christ's
[21:03] name we pray
[21:04] amen amen you may be seated
[21:10] we want to thank god for the word of god
[21:13] i want to take my time but not too long
[21:17] but i thought of the subject
[21:20] of building
[21:22] upon the revelation of jesus christ in
[21:25] you
[21:26] building
[21:27] upon the revelation of jesus christ
[21:31] in you
[21:33] one of the things that we must first
[21:35] realize
[21:36] is that who we are
[21:39] as individuals you must come to know
[21:43] that you're a bride amen
[21:46] not because somebody else says it to you
[21:49] but it's something that within you
[21:52] must speak to you and tell you who you
[21:54] really are amen you say what you mean
[21:57] speak to you
[21:58] remember when
[22:00] in the beginning
[22:01] uh when
[22:03] adam
[22:04] produced his female
[22:06] adam
[22:07] uh it was adam
[22:09] who told eve who she was
[22:12] she had no idea
[22:14] on who she really was and her
[22:17] relationship with him
[22:20] not only did he tell her
[22:22] who she was he said you're born in my
[22:24] bone and flesh of my flesh
[22:27] so you must understand the second adam
[22:30] who is jesus christ amen is alive and
[22:33] well
[22:34] and we must know that he the word must
[22:38] speak to you amen
[22:41] so that you'll know
[22:43] who you are amen
[22:45] we are the housing of god
[22:48] we are the new creation of god
[22:51] we have said it in so many ways
[22:55] paul said when i was a child i spake
[22:57] like a child i act like a child i did
[22:59] those childish things but now that the
[23:02] word of god has come
[23:04] and let me say it like this when
[23:06] throughout the church ages we were like
[23:08] children
[23:10] and brother branham and i his day he
[23:12] called the pentecostals pentecostal
[23:15] babies
[23:16] so they were just children and and then
[23:19] and they fought with each other they
[23:21] they did all kinds of things against
[23:24] each other they separated themselves
[23:25] they pouted against each other
[23:28] like children
[23:29] but now with the opening of the word
[23:32] with the seals broken
[23:35] and the headship of god come down
[23:38] we need to learn how to
[23:41] allow christ
[23:43] to be formed in us
[23:45] to mature in us
[23:47] to cause us to come into his very image
[23:51] and his likeness see we are here for a
[23:55] purpose amen hallelujah and the purpose
[23:58] is scripturally known
[24:00] it's not such a mystery that god is is
[24:03] hiding in some
[24:05] in any way because god has opened up the
[24:07] mystery of what his purpose is for us
[24:11] and if you understand the beginning of
[24:13] genesis you'll come to understand that
[24:15] it was always god's desire
[24:18] to multiply
[24:20] himself
[24:22] every seed shall bring forth of its kind
[24:26] amen so you and i must understand amen
[24:29] that the prayer that jesus prayed even
[24:32] in saint john 17. i'm just going to go
[24:35] there 17 john 17 22 quickly
[24:39] he prayed and he wanted to see the
[24:42] things that he came to know and to
[24:44] understand amen what the will of god was
[24:47] and is
[24:49] uh he knew that his seed was to come
[24:53] and and and he knew that because of his
[24:55] death barrier and resurrection
[24:58] they were going to come there was
[25:00] nothing now that could hinder
[25:02] god from moving into the
[25:05] heart and life of a human being anymore
[25:09] because remember in the old testament
[25:12] god could only anoint the flesh and the
[25:14] spirit
[25:16] but that's not where god resides god
[25:19] resides in the soul
[25:21] and when jesus came he conquered death
[25:25] hell and the grave and he brought back
[25:27] the prize he bought he he he paid the
[25:30] price excuse me for everything
[25:33] and now death
[25:35] has been stripped
[25:37] hell has been stripped
[25:40] the grave has been stripped
[25:43] and satan himself has been stripped
[25:46] he has no power
[25:49] over the seed of god
[25:51] hallelujah
[25:53] amen in saint john 17
[25:57] 22 i love saint john 17. it speaks
[25:59] directly to me and and i love reading
[26:02] this chapter over and over again i've
[26:04] always get something out of it i always
[26:06] get something out of it
[26:08] it says and the glory which thou gavet
[26:11] me
[26:12] i have given them
[26:14] that they may be one
[26:17] even
[26:18] as we are one
[26:20] praise god hallelujah
[26:22] i in them
[26:25] thou in me
[26:26] that they may be made perfect in one
[26:30] and that the world may know
[26:33] that thou has sent me
[26:35] and has loved them as thou has loved me
[26:39] now that's a powerful
[26:42] love
[26:44] and i still think that often time when
[26:47] we think about the love of god we think
[26:49] of god that love on a human level
[26:53] instead of taking it to the agape love
[26:55] we keep it on the filio
[26:58] and filio love will always fail you
[27:01] it is not the perfect love there's only
[27:04] one perfect love
[27:06] this love says
[27:08] in that while you were yet sinners
[27:12] i died for you
[27:15] that's powerful
[27:17] hallelujah
[27:19] like i was telling my son the other day
[27:21] and i was going through saint john with
[27:23] him a little bit the fourth chapter i
[27:25] believe it was and i was telling him by
[27:27] way of the phone and i told him and i
[27:29] said listen if you've got the holy ghost
[27:31] if you're truly saved you shouldn't
[27:34] worry about your salvation amen
[27:37] at all
[27:38] because you didn't pay the price
[27:41] right
[27:42] he paid the price
[27:44] right i don't have to if i owe some
[27:46] money for rent and a brother came and
[27:49] paid my rent
[27:51] now i don't have to worry about the rent
[27:52] being paid
[27:54] i don't have to worry about being kicked
[27:56] out
[27:56] i don't have to worry about penalties
[27:59] because the rent was paid
[28:02] so has this the the sentence of sin
[28:07] it's been paid
[28:09] and that that that that that sentence
[28:11] was death in itself
[28:13] and jesus died for you the bible said he
[28:16] died for the ungodly amen oftentimes in
[28:19] this message we we forget the simplicity
[28:22] of these things
[28:23] and we find ourselves so burdened and
[28:25] down and depressed and whatever more and
[28:28] we we act as if there's something you
[28:31] can do we can do about our salvation and
[28:35] the prophet god told us this there's
[28:37] nothing you can do
[28:39] amen
[28:40] it's not even in your hands
[28:42] hallelujah amen it always happened
[28:47] in the in the hands of god
[28:49] sometimes the devil says oh you're a
[28:50] conqueror you're not a conqueror
[28:54] unless you've got the conqueror in you
[28:57] he's the mighty conqueror not you
[29:00] you just there or
[29:02] along for the ride
[29:04] is that all right
[29:06] and this is thing this is the thing
[29:08] building upon that you must faith in
[29:10] itself is the foundation
[29:13] everything that's in this world word you
[29:16] must apply faith to it yes amen amen
[29:19] hallelujah understand me
[29:22] because the bible tells us that we are
[29:24] the children of abraham's seed we are
[29:27] abraham's seeds excuse me we are the
[29:29] children of abraham which makes us
[29:31] abraham's seed
[29:32] and abraham was the father of faith
[29:35] amen a lot of times we
[29:38] we want this uh great gush of wind and
[29:41] uh or some whirlwind or some thunder and
[29:45] lightning or some chills up and down our
[29:47] body to signify we've got faith
[29:51] that's not even the way faith works
[29:54] first of all you can't feel faith
[29:58] faith is in the soul
[29:59] hallelujah y'all understand me faith is
[30:02] a revelation that you cannot even
[30:05] explain
[30:06] how can you explain that you're saved
[30:10] how can you explain that your sins have
[30:12] been washed away
[30:14] how can you explain even the holy ghost
[30:17] that you claim to have how can you
[30:19] explain it is
[30:20] unexplainable but you know it's more
[30:23] real
[30:24] than the seats that you're setting in
[30:26] amen
[30:27] [Music]
[30:30] nobody can take it from you
[30:32] because god gave it to you
[30:35] this is not a trial and error test
[30:38] this is something that god determined
[30:40] for you and me before the foundation of
[30:44] the world amen
[30:46] hallelujah the reason why we need the
[30:49] holy ghost is because as long as we got
[30:51] the holy ghost we are more than
[30:54] conquerors
[30:57] it's the truth
[30:58] the holy ghost in you is a conqueror
[31:01] the holy ghost in you amen is the one
[31:04] who destroys and defeat your enemy amen
[31:09] thank you amen hallelujah is that right
[31:13] brother branham the prophet of our day
[31:15] he says i'm waiting on him
[31:19] if brother branham was the conqueror he
[31:20] would have been able to do something
[31:23] he said i can't give you the holy ghost
[31:25] he says i can't heal you he said there's
[31:28] no such thing as a divine healer
[31:30] amen if a man can be a divine healer
[31:32] he's a divine savior
[31:35] he said i'm neither of that amen but he
[31:39] jesus christ
[31:41] i'm here to bear witness that he's the
[31:43] same yesterday today and forever
[31:47] hallelujah i'm actually his forerunner
[31:50] i'm the guy who's telling you he's on
[31:52] his way
[31:54] listen and let me say it like this he's
[31:56] come yes amen
[32:00] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[32:04] a lot of times we look for god up here
[32:09] that's not where you're supposed to be
[32:10] looking
[32:12] he's in here he's behind the veil
[32:16] what is he doing behind the veil
[32:18] he's changing you
[32:21] it is a mystery but he's changing you
[32:24] from glory to glory
[32:26] y'all hear me not just a feeling it's a
[32:29] voice it's a word he talks he speaks he
[32:34] instructs he leads he guides he do all
[32:38] of those things
[32:40] to who
[32:45] how many times you you know the devil
[32:47] said that's your conscience how many
[32:48] times
[32:49] god is spoken
[32:52] hallelujah
[32:53] and he didn't speak from out there he
[32:55] spoke from in here
[32:58] hallelujah and when he speaks from in
[33:00] here that's god
[33:03] but we need to learn how to cultivate
[33:05] that amen see the more we die the more
[33:08] he lives
[33:10] hallelujah
[33:14] in matthew the 16th chapter you don't
[33:16] have to turn
[33:17] but i'm just going to quote the 18th
[33:18] verse
[33:20] here jesus was talking to his disciples
[33:22] and he asked them who do men say i the
[33:25] son of man am
[33:27] see they know what the son of man the
[33:29] son of man was a prophet that's what's
[33:30] another name for a prophet ezekiel son
[33:33] of man jeremiah the son of man that was
[33:35] another word or phrase for a prophet but
[33:38] he said who do you say this prophet is
[33:40] amen
[33:41] right
[33:42] in other words i'm different from
[33:44] jeremiah amen i'm different from all the
[33:46] other prophets and i need you to know
[33:48] who i am amen
[33:50] you need to know this revelation now let
[33:52] me say it like this if they need to know
[33:54] it then you need to know it now amen
[33:58] right
[34:00] this is what i love because jesus says
[34:02] in that day i'll be not only with you
[34:05] but i'll be in you come on amen
[34:08] amen hallelujah what are you saying
[34:11] brother in this day the revelation of
[34:14] jesus christ is being in house in a
[34:17] housing
[34:18] in what we call the bride
[34:21] he's in there why because in
[34:24] revelation the third chapter you open
[34:26] the door he said if you open the door
[34:29] unto me i will come into you and have
[34:33] suff suff with you i come in
[34:39] glory to god
[34:42] hallelujah is that all right
[34:45] and peter says thou out the christ you
[34:48] know
[34:49] because they all didn't know at that
[34:50] time but peter said thou art the christ
[34:53] the son of the living god
[34:57] what is and then jesus says i say unto
[34:59] you
[35:00] and today that thou art peter
[35:03] and upon this rock
[35:06] i will build my church that's why we
[35:07] need the prophet
[35:09] because some people thought that he was
[35:10] trying to build a church on peter
[35:14] it took a profit to give us
[35:15] understanding it was not peter
[35:18] it wasn't even a natural rock
[35:20] it was the revelation
[35:22] of who jesus christ was that's the
[35:24] content of the whole
[35:26] subject matter
[35:27] right and so we realized by god's grace
[35:30] he said upon this rock you need to hear
[35:32] this because we we quote the scriptures
[35:34] all the time upon this rock i will build
[35:38] my church
[35:39] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[35:42] against it
[35:44] hallelujah meaning when you've got the
[35:47] holy ghost when you have the revelation
[35:50] of jesus christ in you no baptist no
[35:53] methodist no presbyter no
[35:56] gate hello
[35:59] no gate
[36:00] amen none of the gates
[36:02] will prevail against you
[36:04] no wickedness
[36:06] shall prevail against you
[36:08] you cannot be deceived
[36:10] amen
[36:13] you cannot that's true be deceived
[36:17] not because you can't be deceived but
[36:19] because the christ who wrote the word
[36:22] cannot be deceived he knows his
[36:25] it's the christ in you
[36:28] hallelujah
[36:29] is that all right so you must understand
[36:33] what was jesus doing
[36:36] because he said to simon but johnny he
[36:38] said flesh and blood
[36:41] have not revealed it unto you but my
[36:43] father which is in heaven so he takes it
[36:46] to another level
[36:48] they understand and yet they don't
[36:50] understand even when jesus says amen in
[36:53] saint john 10 30 when you see me you see
[36:56] the father see those who were
[36:58] counter-minded looked at a man's body
[37:01] and that's not what he was talking about
[37:03] he was working with character amen
[37:06] and then he was also working with the
[37:07] things that he had done because he said
[37:09] if you don't believe that i am he
[37:11] believe me for my very work the very
[37:13] works say
[37:14] you understand me so he was displaying
[37:17] the invisible god
[37:19] to them but he was the housing
[37:22] he was the literal housing of god there
[37:26] had been none like him amen
[37:29] none
[37:30] amen
[37:31] amen
[37:32] the bible said in him was the fullness
[37:34] of the godhead bodily and i love quoting
[37:37] that scripture
[37:38] because
[37:40] all that was in
[37:41] christ
[37:43] he poured it into the church
[37:46] amen is that right
[37:47] if he was a fullness of the godhead
[37:50] bodily then who is the bride
[37:53] amen
[37:54] if he poured it all
[37:56] nothing was left undone
[37:59] he finished the word
[38:01] amen
[38:02] hallelujah
[38:04] in the message invisible union
[38:07] he said but you remember
[38:10] when it went down
[38:15] and get began to
[38:17] excuse me you remember when it went down
[38:20] you talk about the grain i'm sorry when
[38:21] the grain began to ripen
[38:24] everything in the stock had to be dead
[38:27] hallelujah
[38:29] can you see where we're standing now
[38:32] what is he working with
[38:33] he's calling something stalk
[38:36] amen now if the bride or the life has
[38:39] moved out of laodicea
[38:42] lay of the seal has become stalked
[38:45] come on it's nothing but the truth
[38:48] every age became tap
[38:51] stop whatever you want to call it
[38:54] the remains were left to be burned yes
[38:57] amen but the life kept moving
[39:00] you understand me this is what i'm
[39:02] trying to say we must mature into the
[39:05] life
[39:06] the life is not something that we have
[39:08] in our head it is it is it's an
[39:11] expression it is god himself we must
[39:14] move into that life where god is living
[39:17] amen in our housing
[39:20] amen
[39:23] if it's just theology you're missing it
[39:26] if it's just what phrases that we use
[39:29] for what we call the message you're
[39:32] missing it
[39:33] the purpose of christ's death barrier
[39:35] and resurrection was to bring forth his
[39:37] own kind amen
[39:40] amen the seed planted in the ground he
[39:43] came up
[39:44] right
[39:45] and on the day of pentecost what
[39:47] happened there and then god began to
[39:50] multiply himself amen
[39:53] and the devil came
[39:54] inhabited so it could never produce a
[39:57] real thing
[39:58] but in the last day amen he the alpha
[40:02] became the obey mega man the original
[40:05] she was planted again
[40:08] amen that's the truth yes it is
[40:14] right you have you had three c's in this
[40:17] day preached
[40:18] three planted that's what the prophet
[40:20] said
[40:21] billy graham oral roberts and william
[40:24] branham amen right and these are the
[40:26] seeds that are now being
[40:30] harvested amen
[40:32] amen
[40:33] you understand me
[40:34] so you say well what do you mean this is
[40:36] why you could not be attracted this is
[40:38] why it could not hold you this is why
[40:41] amen this message caught your attention
[40:44] because that's where you came from
[40:47] [Applause]
[40:50] hallelujah
[40:52] what is it just exactly the same
[40:59] he said what the same grain that went
[41:01] into the ground the same jesus in dry
[41:04] form amen same power
[41:07] same church
[41:09] same thing
[41:10] same word you understand me so if you
[41:13] get if you don't have the same power see
[41:16] because a lot of times when you got
[41:17] power or are you seeing the supernatural
[41:20] oftentimes people say that's pentecostal
[41:22] well you better have it
[41:24] [Music]
[41:26] right if you can't believe in healing
[41:29] you surely can't believe in resurrection
[41:32] because you can't be that's the greatest
[41:33] healing god is going to ever do
[41:37] amen
[41:40] is that right you've got to have the
[41:41] same it must be the same power the same
[41:44] church the same thing the same word it
[41:47] must produce the same thing yes sir
[41:50] amen
[41:52] hallelujah let me say it like this and
[41:54] something the holy spirit spoke to my
[41:55] heart today when a man goes around and
[41:58] he does the same thing over and over and
[42:01] over again and expect a different result
[42:04] you call that what insanity
[42:12] if you are doing the same thing over and
[42:15] over and over and over again and you
[42:17] expect a different result come on
[42:20] something's not right
[42:24] the only way
[42:25] that can ever change is that you must
[42:27] bring a change
[42:30] and only god can bring the change
[42:33] somehow you've got to look within
[42:35] yourself this is why the bible says
[42:37] examine yourself to see whether you be
[42:40] in the faith folks that must be done on
[42:43] the daily basis
[42:45] yes sir
[42:46] hallelujah confession is done on a daily
[42:49] basis
[42:50] father forgive me on a daily basis lord
[42:54] i'm sorry on a daily basis hallelujah
[42:59] and the bible said if we confess our
[43:01] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[43:04] us of our sins and to cleanse us from
[43:07] all unrighteousness
[43:08] but this is a daily process we'll keep
[43:12] doing this until we reach our goals amen
[43:17] hallelujah and that's what's wrong with
[43:19] some people they have the word in their
[43:21] head and they think they've arrived but
[43:22] let me tell you something you not you
[43:24] having a ride amen until this world is
[43:27] living
[43:29] it must live through you
[43:30] [Music]
[43:32] hallelujah who i feel so good up here
[43:35] same thing same word the same word
[43:38] sucked up through these and come out
[43:41] here and come to a head here see and all
[43:45] that life that comes through here
[43:48] picks up
[43:50] its people that's right
[43:53] light picked you up
[43:55] you didn't choose it it picked you up
[43:58] right
[43:59] something's happening
[44:01] and the prophet of god is not using
[44:03] those words
[44:05] for naught
[44:07] the bible says amen that we are now
[44:09] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[44:12] jesus so the word doesn't leave you
[44:15] earthbound it picks you up and places
[44:18] you into another dimension
[44:21] oh come on somebody and that's the
[44:23] problem many of us are still living in
[44:25] the fourth dimension when god is trying
[44:28] to get us elevated to live in the sixth
[44:30] dimension
[44:32] hallelujah where eternal life is
[44:37] you don't believe me
[44:38] but jesus said it like this how can the
[44:40] son of man be on earth in heaven at the
[44:42] same time
[44:47] amen hallelujah how can you be on earth
[44:50] and in heaven at the same time
[44:52] you are
[44:54] because you have a theophany
[44:56] hallelujah and that theophany is in the
[44:59] sixth dimension
[45:01] this is what picked you up
[45:03] and one of these old days you're going
[45:05] to have a final pick up
[45:08] but we must press
[45:10] it's not an easy journey
[45:12] you and i must press into it we fall
[45:15] down but we get up
[45:18] amen
[45:20] praise the lord you know the word god is
[45:22] coming folks
[45:23] the bible said a just man fought seven
[45:25] times in a day and get up
[45:28] hallelujah
[45:30] you love the lord
[45:32] so we find out by god's grace he says
[45:34] now it's forming up into a head
[45:37] for what the rapture
[45:40] speaking
[45:41] on tomorrow night he says you know see
[45:44] well you separate well you separated
[45:47] from your first union
[45:50] by spiritual death
[45:53] now you are born again or remarried
[45:56] again
[45:57] to the new spiritual union
[46:00] of not of your natural life of the
[46:03] things of the world
[46:04] but of eternal life

[46:10] at the beginning
[46:11] found you
[46:15] aren't you glad to be found
[46:17] amazing grace

[46:27] gone
[46:29] what i used to be is gone
[46:32] hallelujah even if i make mistakes now
[46:34] it's gone
[46:36] did you know that
[46:38] amen the prophet god tells us that the
[46:40] justification in the word is it's it's
[46:43] though you've never seen in the first
[46:45] place
[46:46] grace is guilty mercy is guilty excuse
[46:48] me mercy is guilty because you're caught
[46:50] and you found in your judge and you need
[46:52] some mercy but mercy plays not in this
[46:55] the headstone came down calling grace
[46:57] grace
[46:58] and that's unmerited love and favor for
[47:01] you you mean to tell me god loves me
[47:03] that much that he's had to say twice yes
[47:09] hallelujah amen yes sir
[47:12] now your name is in your own
[47:14] it has been transferred oh book

[53:12] and you it can't be aborted
[53:15] it's real

[53:44] gospel of jesus christ for it is the
[53:47] power of god unto salvation
[53:50] it's the power over sickness it's power
[53:53] over death it's power over the grave and
[53:57] when those stern death and and when the
[54:00] when the stern death it's the power over
[54:02] the grave see and when the stern death
[54:05] of old apostle came to his end of his
[54:08] road excuse me
[54:11] when the stern old apostle came to the
[54:13] end of his road and they dug his grave
[54:17] out there and death was facing him
[54:20] in the face
[54:22] he laughed
[54:23] in the face of it
[54:25] y'all understand me this holy ghost will
[54:28] make you laugh in the face of death
[54:30] when you know you really got it amen
[54:34] y'all understand me you're not afraid of
[54:36] him anymore when you know you really got
[54:39] it no matter if cancer gets you no
[54:41] matter whatever comes amen
[54:44] because that's what the devil is going
[54:46] to
[54:47] uh
[54:48] a place of fear on the people now you
[54:50] you y'all think it was bad when corona
[54:53] hit but wait till this thing start
[54:54] locking down and see how fear
[54:59] will grow up
[55:01] fear will become so enlarged
[55:04] now we know that's what's happening now
[55:06] the bible said men's hearts are failing
[55:08] for fear
[55:09] even now
[55:11] people jumping out of windows committing
[55:13] suicide and everything else because of
[55:15] what's coming on the earth
[55:18] but we don't fear no sir we know it's
[55:20] going home time
[55:22] this is the time of our exodus
[55:27] yeah it doesn't mean it's going to be
[55:28] easy
[55:29] hallelujah
[55:31] but neither is giving birth to a baby
[55:33] but you know at the end of the day you
[55:35] got your baby
[55:37] you understand
[55:38] hallelujah and right now we're birthing
[55:41] we're going into something and and we
[55:44] can already already you know see the
[55:46] cramps and you know how that comes
[55:50] hallelujah he laughed in the face of it
[55:53] he said death where is your sting grave
[55:55] where is your victory then he
[55:58] shouted the praise of god
[56:01] but thanks be to god
[56:03] who gives us the victory
[56:06] through our lord jesus christ
[56:09] hallelujah isn't that wonderful amen now
[56:12] i say this because
[56:15] i think it was bob's worth what did
[56:16] bosworth the one there was they were
[56:18] singing all those sad songs
[56:20] he said hey give me some snappy
[56:22] something who dying me or you
[56:27] see you know he was excited for this
[56:29] purpose i lived this life for this end
[56:33] because this is not the end this is my
[56:35] beginning
[56:38] that's why that's why paul laughed at
[56:40] death he understood it wasn't his end
[56:42] this was his beginning this is what i've
[56:44] been preaching for suffering for
[56:48] desiring to leave and could not leave
[56:51] now it's my time
[56:55] jesus
[56:58] right the mighty conqueror that ever
[57:00] lived that's right he was the mighty
[57:04] conqueror that ever died for he was the
[57:06] only one who could
[57:08] conquer
[57:09] die
[57:10] and conquer death itself
[57:12] and rise again in triumph he proved
[57:16] this is where i'm going he proved what
[57:19] he was
[57:21] it was the last seal
[57:24] of his messiahship
[57:32] what are you talking about he is that
[57:34] that was that's what proved him that was
[57:36] the last seal and remember he was the
[57:39] seventh seal of his days
[57:42] jesus
[57:44] and he broke that seal what we call the
[57:46] easter seal remember seven is completion
[57:50] hallelujah and he broke that
[57:52] seal hallelujah went down into the grave
[57:56] that the devil had only known if he knew
[57:59] y'all better hear what i'm saying
[58:01] because we give the devil too much power
[58:03] amen
[58:04] we give him stuff that he doesn't
[58:06] deserve amen he's stripped
[58:09] we must realize he's stripped yes
[58:12] oftentimes we don't get things that we
[58:14] desire to have because we're looking at
[58:17] god like he's a million miles away and
[58:19] he says i'm not there you you're off the
[58:21] word when you think he's a million miles
[58:24] away
[58:25] he said i'm i'm not there
[58:27] in that day you'll know that i'm in the
[58:30] father of the fathers in me and i'm in
[58:31] you i'm on the throne of your heart
[58:34] so how do you connect with him by way of
[58:37] prayer
[58:38] submitting yourself to him amen
[58:43] amen this sounds crazy but it's true
[58:46] anyhow
[58:48] but jesus when he went to pray
[58:52] he says father
[58:55] i wouldn't this cup pass from me
[58:58] but understand brother bannon tells us
[59:00] he said it was
[59:02] right at that time jesus of the father
[59:05] separated himself because
[59:07] he became sin
[59:09] that's right and and god can't handle
[59:12] sin he can't be in the presence of sin
[59:14] so he became sin for us
[59:17] that we might become what he's righteous
[59:19] now
[59:20] so
[59:21] for the first time he's separated he
[59:23] says
[59:25] you know my god my god
[59:27] why
[59:30] hast thou forsaken me you and i can't
[59:32] imagine what that feeling was like
[59:36] because he never experienced it before
[59:38] he was always there he never sinned so
[59:41] it never broke the communion the
[59:43] fellowship
[59:44] but now here was something that that
[59:47] that was already written in the psalms
[59:49] he was going to say but
[59:51] this now has become a revelation
[59:54] of being rejected
[59:56] y'all understand me that's why you
[59:58] cannot be rejected by god because he was
[1:00:02] rejected for you
[1:00:04] he took his your sin
[1:00:06] so when the devil tried to make you feel
[1:00:08] reject him you he's a liar
[1:00:11] he christ paid for that amen
[1:00:16] hallelujah and the devil like to work
[1:00:18] with our feelings
[1:00:20] try to make us feel like we're not saved
[1:00:22] and try to make us feel like we're
[1:00:23] hypocrites and try to make us feel like
[1:00:26] all kinds of stuff that's not godly and
[1:00:28] he's a liar amen
[1:00:30] you need to put the holy ghost home
[1:00:35] hallelujah is that all right his
[1:00:37] messiahship
[1:00:39] and then the prophet god says when the
[1:00:40] holy ghost comes into you you are little
[1:00:41] messiahs
[1:00:45] so somewhere you've conquered something
[1:00:46] too
[1:00:48] huh you're no longer dead but you're
[1:00:49] alive your resurrection when god gave
[1:00:52] you the holy ghost you defeated death
[1:00:56] amen
[1:00:57] did y'all know that
[1:00:58] you defeated death when god gives you
[1:01:01] the holy oath that means you died to
[1:01:03] yourself and god comes in and he's
[1:01:05] living and that's why he said you cannot
[1:01:07] die again amen
[1:01:13] you can't hold your your body down
[1:01:16] hallelujah
[1:01:18] is this okay
[1:01:19] let me hurry because uh let me hurry
[1:01:21] second corinthians says now thanks be to
[1:01:22] god which always causes us to triumph in
[1:01:25] christ
[1:01:27] in you christ in you christ causes you
[1:01:29] to triumph right and maketh manifest the
[1:01:33] savior of his knowledge by us in every
[1:01:36] place that means we can be winners
[1:01:39] wherever we go
[1:01:40] triumph wherever we go
[1:01:43] god is is that right oftentimes we you
[1:01:45] see i see it i see it clearly
[1:01:49] we don't acknowledge the lord in all of
[1:01:51] our ways
[1:01:52] he said if you acknowledge me in all of
[1:01:54] your ways he then will direct your past
[1:01:57] but we don't do that
[1:01:59] oftentimes instead of being the body we
[1:02:02] try to be the head
[1:02:04] and as long as as long as you allow
[1:02:06] yourself to be the head of your life
[1:02:08] you're going to keep bumping up into
[1:02:09] things because you have no eyes to see
[1:02:12] he has the eyes
[1:02:14] all right let's move on amen save us o
[1:02:17] lord our god and gather us from among
[1:02:20] the heathen
[1:02:21] to give thanks
[1:02:23] unto thy holy name
[1:02:25] and to triumph in thy place
[1:02:28] hallelujah now here's the great triumph
[1:02:32] the manifestation of his messiahship
[1:02:35] when he took the book
[1:02:37] out of the right right hand of him
[1:02:39] that sat upon the throne
[1:02:42] no man could take it
[1:02:44] we know that's been in our day
[1:02:47] right and so we know that not only was
[1:02:50] he supposed to take the book but the
[1:02:52] bride how did she become righteous
[1:02:54] enough
[1:02:57] to take the book
[1:02:59] is that right
[1:03:00] because when the angel told john take
[1:03:02] the book
[1:03:03] john represented the bride amen
[1:03:06] hallelujah and the only reason why she
[1:03:09] could take the book is because jesus
[1:03:11] christ her husband paid the price
[1:03:14] so that the life that was once with adam
[1:03:17] can now return to the bride of jesus
[1:03:19] christ which was the holy spirit and his
[1:03:22] protection amen
[1:03:25] see that's what this oh god if we could
[1:03:28] see it that's what this message does it
[1:03:32] not only protects you
[1:03:34] it matures you
[1:03:38] it is that wall of fire about you
[1:03:42] it is the living god
[1:03:44] hidden in such a way that only the bride
[1:03:47] of jesus christ knows what it is
[1:03:53] think about it we're now eating manna
[1:03:55] that once was veiled and the only high
[1:03:58] priest could could actually eat of it
[1:04:02] but now amen is veiled again but in
[1:04:05] human flesh
[1:04:07] hallelujah and what is he doing now he's
[1:04:10] changing us from glory to glory to glory
[1:04:14] and we need to allow him to do so when
[1:04:17] god said don't do it don't do it when
[1:04:19] god said don't go don't go
[1:04:21] amen
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:24] y'all know
[1:04:28] amen hallelujah
[1:04:30] and he took that little book out of the
[1:04:32] angel's hand and ate it
[1:04:35] up
[1:04:37] and it was in
[1:04:39] my mouth this is what john said sweet as
[1:04:41] honey
[1:04:43] and as soon as i had eaten it
[1:04:45] my belly was bitter
[1:04:47] in other words i didn't pick and choose
[1:04:51] any of the word that's right i ate it
[1:04:53] all up
[1:04:55] like israel's what was was uh commanded
[1:04:57] to do with the paschal land eat it all
[1:05:00] up
[1:05:02] right
[1:05:03] you love the lord amen i know i've been
[1:05:06] here for a while but i'm gonna cut it
[1:05:08] short i'm gonna cut it short because i
[1:05:09] know this is wednesday night
[1:05:12] but i will read this quote before i let
[1:05:13] you go
[1:05:15] see say this this is an ongoing thing it
[1:05:18] is an everyday thing
[1:05:20] now i don't know about you sometimes i i
[1:05:22] wake up in the morning and i don't have
[1:05:24] the right attitude
[1:05:26] sometimes my attitude is like oh no i
[1:05:29] got to go through this again
[1:05:34] y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but
[1:05:36] it's the truth
[1:05:37] but you i have to re i have to adjust
[1:05:39] that that spirit
[1:05:41] i have to adjust that that's that's
[1:05:43] before i get on my knees y'all
[1:05:45] understand me i have to adjust that
[1:05:48] anointing because if you don't adjust
[1:05:50] that spirit you go through a whole day
[1:05:54] with that attitude
[1:05:56] and that means you're going to have a
[1:05:57] bad day
[1:06:01] you got to wash yourself from that
[1:06:03] devil's thought because that's the
[1:06:04] thought the devil gave you
[1:06:06] wash yourself and realize i'm bright
[1:06:10] devil you better know it
[1:06:12] i'm up now
[1:06:15] you got to work some faith in there you
[1:06:17] got to let the devil know i'm i'm awake
[1:06:20] now
[1:06:21] and jesus is in the inside of me and you
[1:06:24] know you got to preach the word to the
[1:06:25] devil
[1:06:26] to have a good day have a good day i'm
[1:06:29] going to have a good day
[1:06:30] but i'm gonna make the devil's day
[1:06:32] miserable
[1:06:34] right hallelujah he come with that
[1:06:36] nonsense and you gotta readjust that you
[1:06:38] gotta change it because otherwise
[1:06:40] your whole day was gonna go bad
[1:06:43] amen i will enter his gates with
[1:06:46] thanksgiving in my heart i will enter
[1:06:48] his course with praise and you do that
[1:06:50] on your knees
[1:06:52] hallelujah i think the church has been
[1:06:55] preached to death
[1:06:58] brother says in jehovah jireh
[1:07:00] the thing it needs now is to come back
[1:07:03] to teaching
[1:07:04] and get it on
[1:07:06] the foundation
[1:07:08] so you'll know how to build yourself up
[1:07:12] in
[1:07:12] christ
[1:07:14] and we built our churches
[1:07:16] upon sensations
[1:07:18] and upon the different things
[1:07:21] but can't build upon nothing but christ
[1:07:26] that's the only way you can build
[1:07:27] you've got to build on christ
[1:07:29] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:07:32] that's the only thing that we could do
[1:07:36] in him you are complete
[1:07:39] without him
[1:07:40] you're lost and there's not a way in the
[1:07:44] world for you to be saved
[1:07:47] see that's the building
[1:07:50] him
[1:07:50] in you
[1:07:52] word upon word lying upon line precept
[1:07:55] upon precepts
[1:07:59] you've got to realize
[1:08:00] that you are dead
[1:08:02] you're no
[1:08:04] good at all
[1:08:06] you're filthy
[1:08:08] and god's the only one can help you
[1:08:11] that's right see now if you think you
[1:08:13] got some goodness about you
[1:08:15] you ain't dead yet
[1:08:18] you know sometimes people think oh when
[1:08:20] i come to church i yeah i can i can make
[1:08:22] it happen you can't make nothing happen
[1:08:28] i don't care if you've been a virgin all
[1:08:30] your life
[1:08:31] you're still filthy
[1:08:34] remember whether you be man or woman you
[1:08:36] still filthy you were born in sin that's
[1:08:39] right and let me tell you something
[1:08:41] because
[1:08:43] of those things you still have evil
[1:08:45] thoughts
[1:08:47] that don't stop evil thoughts
[1:08:50] like i try to tell people i say you
[1:08:52] could be a monk
[1:08:54] go into the highest mountain on top of
[1:08:56] us
[1:08:57] and guess what sin gonna find you
[1:09:00] why because you brought it there
[1:09:02] you took it there it's with you
[1:09:05] sin is in the flesh
[1:09:07] unbelievers in the flesh
[1:09:14] you got to kill it
[1:09:17] listen he said that's right when you do
[1:09:19] that
[1:09:20] then you're getting close to the kingdom
[1:09:23] of god
[1:09:24] when you reckon yourself nothing
[1:09:26] and just solemnly
[1:09:28] uh
[1:09:29] depend on him
[1:09:31] and let the holy spirit
[1:09:34] lead
[1:09:35] you
[1:09:37] amen
[1:09:40] hallelujah one more
[1:09:42] but see there's not a thing that you can
[1:09:45] do to save yourself
[1:09:48] there's not one thing
[1:09:50] you've got to solemnly trust
[1:09:52] on the grace of god
[1:09:54] to do it
[1:09:55] you can't save yourself
[1:09:57] i don't care how religious you are
[1:10:00] and how good you try to be and keep all
[1:10:02] the commandments and everything
[1:10:05] that won't do one thing there's not one
[1:10:08] thing you can do to merit anything
[1:10:11] you're just simply lost
[1:10:14] and that's all to it there's not a way
[1:10:17] for you
[1:10:18] you have to accept his provided method
[1:10:22] that's jesus christ
[1:10:24] and it's freely see you don't have to do
[1:10:26] one thing but just accept what's been
[1:10:30] given to you
[1:10:32] not not a thing you can do
[1:10:35] see that's why i'm preaching
[1:10:38] because oftentimes we think that all
[1:10:40] that i preached i'm sure the mind have
[1:10:43] thought to itself what could i do
[1:10:47] i'll tell you what it what you can do
[1:10:50] repeat
[1:10:52] amen that's all you can do
[1:10:54] that's one thing you have to do
[1:10:58] see if you're going to see christ begin
[1:11:01] to grow
[1:11:02] you've got to acknowledge everything you
[1:11:04] do wrong
[1:11:05] and make it right amen
[1:11:08] you have to
[1:11:10] and i don't mean you got to tell the
[1:11:11] public
[1:11:12] it's between you and god
[1:11:15] when you go into your secret cards the
[1:11:17] closet the bible says
[1:11:18] god will reward you openly
[1:11:22] it's about you it's a love affair
[1:11:25] god's going to have with you
[1:11:27] and let me tell you like this in closing
[1:11:30] the one person
[1:11:33] that is most difficult to tell on
[1:11:36] is yourself
[1:11:40] that's the truth
[1:11:44] there have been things in my mind at
[1:11:45] times
[1:11:46] i almost stutter when i'm praying
[1:11:48] because it's hard to get out
[1:11:52] but the only way to get rid of it is to
[1:11:54] get it out
[1:11:55] your confession it didn't say the way
[1:11:57] you think uh out of this
[1:12:00] mouth
[1:12:01] let's stand
[1:12:03] i'll finish this i'm not completely
[1:12:05] finished because
[1:12:06] it's something that we must lock into
[1:12:10] everything the word of god says we are
[1:12:12] that's what we are right
[1:12:14] and if you don't have faith to grab onto
[1:12:16] it you just say lord help me and take
[1:12:18] away the unbelief
[1:12:20] god sees you and he knows you better
[1:12:22] than you know yourself and he knows how
[1:12:24] to remedy everything that you need to be
[1:12:27] taken care of that needs to be taken
[1:12:28] care of
[1:12:30] i'm gracious i'm grateful
[1:12:32] uh to to to be in this message or to be
[1:12:36] able to hear the voice of malachi 4
[1:12:39] to know
[1:12:40] that that was not just a man but the
[1:12:42] voice of god
[1:12:44] and to be able to accept the things that
[1:12:46] are being preached to me
[1:12:48] by way of the tapes and by way of
[1:12:50] ministers who who have studied and
[1:12:52] brought uh the word
[1:12:54] um
[1:12:55] you know i i just
[1:12:58] i've learned so much
[1:13:00] and and even the like i said the message
[1:13:02] that would preach sunday it will never
[1:13:04] lead me
[1:13:06] satan can never defeat me again
[1:13:10] in the time of silence amen
[1:13:13] because i know that doesn't mean he's
[1:13:15] not dead
[1:13:18] and often times have we asked god and
[1:13:21] we've gotten frustrated with things
[1:13:24] and yet god doesn't answer because
[1:13:26] sometimes we think we're the head
[1:13:28] you know like the brothers say god i ask
[1:13:31] you this today and i want it tomorrow
