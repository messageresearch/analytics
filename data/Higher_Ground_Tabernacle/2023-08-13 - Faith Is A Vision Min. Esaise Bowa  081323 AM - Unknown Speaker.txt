um [Music] all I can say is God bless you for being here and I think by faith we're going to have a great Sunday uh Avon comprised before we can start I want to let you guys know here and foreign [Music] [Applause] of God it's raining Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11. it is we are opening up our Bibles let's pray Lord our precious we have your word open up here in front of us and we believe you are the author of the word we don't know anything from your world because your word existed before even became many of your servants spoken about your word before us we want you guys to come to assist us this morning Spirit be in us and over us is over each every one of us this morning Lord we want to open up this world solution problem believing that your world is going to bring solution to our problems believing that your word is going to bring healing where there is sickness and believing that your word is going to bring satisfaction where there is a need remove me from the scene and come and speak to your people I humble myself before you yes and seal my tongue so that I only speak about your words and remove any human thought okay so that only your thoughts dominant here in this place and sin is abandoned on to satura and then we surround ourselves to you the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen eternal project s for I know the thought that I think toward you says the Lord thought of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end [Music] foreign Philippians chapter 1 verse 6. and the Bible says this foreign thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ for his people um you know my brothers and sisters the prophet of God says that before the beginning before that God said let there be light okay let there be the Earth let there be in heaven the second element God had a vision about what the world should be God had a model or a pattern of how the universe should be a continues and when you say Let There be uh yeah division about it and he knew what he was talking about universe so God had the the he he had conceived the plan about what the universe will be gone Lemon Avenue existence and when the universe came to existence it did not come according to another 11 years he came according to the blueprint of God and the prophet of God says foreign [Music] the prophet of God says and it might have been hundreds of years before there was any lights is and as long as it went out of his mouth in the world it has to be manifested it has to be amen amen it's back in the summer something I think we are going hello this is just to let you know existence these things did not just come memories but Moses said that when God pronounced his word as soon as he did the things came to existence but when we receive the prophet of God in this life God showed to the prophet what Moses did not see God when God pronounces they might have been hundreds of years before those things came came to existence why did these things come this year God had a vision yeah because God had to believe in his own words if he did not have faith in his own word amen amen if we are all connected together we're going to go fast may say yeah [Music] if we're sleepy that's gonna make me cold as well and I'm just going to be talking and then we will go go away hello God had to wait for a long time before that came to existence no matter how long your problem is going to take no matter how long the situation is you have to keep your face you have to believe in the vision that God has because faith is a vision and God had to believe in his own views no matter the time and the universe came to existence the prophet of God said in the uh super science the the same sense God spoke when there was nothing what is that science says that super sense is God foreign together with things which was not he spoke his word and believed this world foreign and have everlasting life amen amen the first Vision that God has about the world is that none of us should perish so that none others but so that whosoever believe um the first Vision that God has for his children he wants us all to to gain yeah [Music] God in the vision here the universe came into existence according to division [Music] there is no love if there is time we should talk about oh um you you are worth it you are more important than the blood of Jesus in order to have my own life and if you say that you you will give Mana you know Papa you will go home and say to your husband do you love me did you hear what they preach about yes do you really love me it's not just your husband I'm not saying just the husbands as long as those so the wife also got a show to the husband that you love him if you hear anything about the husband you are waiting for anything from him he he's also waiting for something foreign let's go ahead and reading to Peter chapter 3 verse 9. and the Bible says this is the Lord is not like concerning his promise is long-suffering to us not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance as you heard God is always patients when it comes to the the fulfillingness no matter the time God is patient a friend that completes a promise so that he can accomplish some Among Us that God is like concerning his promise the reason why is because he doesn't mean but so that all should come to repentance Timothy foreign because some of us have lost the countries and they have made shipwreck but he said that you should keep the good yes before many witnesses so if you understand and you are listening Paul is inviting Timothy to fight the good faith of Faith where unto thou or also because the vision that God has for his people Eternal that he says me I have I have fought the good fight I have fought a good father and I have kept the faith everywhere henceforth there was laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me a daddy and not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing so my prayer for you this morning and my call for you this morning so that when we are living here all that we can do all that we can be Allah let's now let past the vision of God for our lives because the vision that God has for us but faith is a vision is I tried to talk about the first Vision that God has for us which is uh for all of us to come to eternal life methanol and now deliver Israel movies he he went to free Israel with his with his um his own understanding Moses was trained in uh the Egyptian Army relationships he had all the knowledge that he has got he had gotten from all the Egyptians and he thought that he could deliver Israel with uh that knowledge but Moses knowledge proved that he could not deliver Israel and Moses failed and he he became because he went first to deliver Israel with his own knowledge in the message a personal experience with God says this is and now we think um and now Moses had a beater failure of Allah foreign and we know that fire attracts and when Moses went to see he that burning bush that was not getting fired God spoke to him and gave him a new vision uh By An Angel and you understand that before Moses came into the bridge Moses had a vision about himself when he came face to face God spoke to him and God gave to Moses a fresh Vision by in angels and I want you guys to um not a problem only had our own Visions then God gives us a fresh peace because Moses said he knew that he was his mother told him that before meeting God Moses failed and that's true yeah but what God is that we seek and find the vision of God foreign see because that's how we we are going to see so every person every group of people or every church so that the church we must all of us seek the vision for our lives after realizing that God doesn't want anyone to perish I want Mission if your fathers kill yourself know how to gift a good thing what more your father will not give anything special to his children can God when you are looking for fish can he give you a stone yeah give you a pay attention his love is unconditional important no matter what you have done God loves his children let me read that's what the prophet it is amen and he wants to love them he's more ready to help us out please God loves his children which in 1964 it is so God loves his children he loves his people he wants to help them God wants to help you more than you want help sister foreign if you can just get that in your heart that God is more you are to help yourself and that's the only way that he will work God loves his children so if you are here this morning no matter the problem no matter the situation that you are going for today God is more willing to us because he gives women brothers and sisters yes multiple thoughts foreign will be to walk into the vision that God has foreign [Applause] the one who started the good work in you will bring it to the expected because God bless these people this I have to do the same thing that's the reason why we don't succeed because we are supposed to know the vision that God has we generally we are all called to big things a says and that's what we always think are they going to show us that we are all called to great things that's true sometimes it's not basketball because in the garden of God the word yellow flowers and they were green flowers and God established the difference and there are big Rivers as well and if we get to heaven God has established Angels according to dogs because in heaven we have seraphines don't be jealous it's done amen the vision that God has for his people firstly is that known after receiving the eternal life is God wants us to walk in the vision that he has for each of one of us we may face ourselves yes my brothers and sisters if we go to the Bible in Genesis chapter five you will see that the Bible talks about the genealogy of the children of um see the the book of the posterity of uh Adams and when God created the man who was in Earth and verse 3 you will see Adam lived and called his name is [Music] foreign what I want you guys to okay soccer [Music] he may also make you not known and known from men as well I don't I mean I'm on the set Adam had seven children and Adam lived and he had sons and daughters but those their names on that listed here and when said which certain age and all the days and God is Not listing their names so God has different Visions for each other in order for us we have to get into the vision of God As I said previously and he says this and to pray until they get a personal experience with God [Applause] [Music] and to pray until they get a personal experience in order to consume all starchiness of the spirit and give them a new vision foreign it is if there is something that the church is to bring a fresh vision from the presence of God to let the people see that God still lives and Reign and moving with the streets and he will until Jesus comes if we go back to the Old Testament yourself you will see that God had established to be the chief of his brothers that he should be the leader of his wife and he showed us I don't know what Joseph told his father Joseph left and I have learned something that God tells us it's always not important to tell it to someone else and the person you are talking foreign eh for 30 cents as he became the Prime Minister and the vision that the brothers that Vision came to me and they say Joseph our brothers and they became to cry and started crying and Joseph had a big heart Elizabeth and he loved them I want to tell somebody and that's the Christian Life is made and all those things better than him minitude I [Music] said and God anointed there is David went through a lot of sufferings and a lot of trials they were sold here were going after him on the other side we had Goliath it was defined and David went through a lot of bad experiences but in all those bad experiences David was always the Overcomer basket because he had the Supreme and all the fight that overcame and when are the the the other animal came the beer the bear yeah when the animal came hey David slew the same onions and one day David was before God was defined the people of God and Dave the devil was between Marcus and the army of God was there seeing everything that Goliath was when David arrives he said why are you all going to say the Philistine listening to this uncircumstances she's been trained since he was a kid David says and David says where did you see did he say before God gave him that good life will be beheaded foreign and those are evil enemies of God that's why I want it now let's not really take into consideration what our eyes by faith consider what God is showing us through Revelations is a good old-fashioned Saint Paul's like David says that's the problem with the people I I meet today yes and when I travel in the country um brothers and sisters of different churches they believe in this message of Deliverance they believe the message of the Lord Jesus God could have been able to deliver them from but in order to go in order to go ahead he did not want to [Music] foreign 162. [Music] it's a faith is a vision too but where separation okay faith is a long-range vision and the best person Visa it doesn't lower its side and um any good children knows that telescope faith is a telescope it's a binocular that you don't look around here you don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is but you use binoculars to look a way off and Faith does that now foreign when Moses accomplished Miracles when you call flies foreign raptured more in order for Moses to see the end would do more years and Moses saw a small man when God gave him the opportunity I was going back to his house you know it is written in Mark 11. if you say to this um is [Music] love it now talking about me no I'm not talking about you I'm talking about someone else I'm talking about someone else and I'm going to be finishing here oh come on God took his prophecy Moses get Faith and in order to accomplish the things don't look at the things happening around you don't look at the event around you imagine and work with them and look at the end what are you going to see at the end [Applause] you are healed no matter what your life basketball because at the end damn guy anymore known to perish and even if your spiritual life is limping my friends you know my brothers and sisters one day he was for the first time he left all those titles foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign everybody cried they shot the ground predicator they came and said oh yeah take my address foreign believe [Music] Mexican foreign said you [Music] [Music] but 14 hours later understand foreign are we going to sing a song according we're going to pray according to what God has revealed to you man we'll walk in the lights such a beautiful light come where the Dew drops of mercy your bride oh shine oh no and by nights Jesus the light of the world oh we'll walk in the lights such a beautiful lights we're walking the two jobs of Mercy are bright oh shine all around us by The End by nights Jesus the light of the world oh all ye sense of Lights Proclaim Jesus the light of the world oh life and mercy in his name Jesus the light of oh we will walk We walking the lights such a beautiful light oh we walk where the two jobs of Mercy are bright oh shine all around us by The End by night Jesus the light of the world oh here the savior's Earnest call cause Jesus the light of the world oh send the gospel truth to all Jesus the light up oh we will walk with you walking the lights such a beautiful light will walk where the two jobs of Mercy are [Music] [Music] the light of the world oh then the bells of heaven will ring o Jesus the Lord oh [Music] such a beautiful life we walk where the two jobs of Mercy are Branch shine around us shine all around us by The End by nights does the light of oh yes we will walk in the light such a beautiful light oh we walk where the two jobs of Mercy are bright shining around us shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world let's pray [Music] [Music] one with the vision that you have foreign so that the [Music] [Music] success in foreign [Music] little blue foreign [Music] God bless you know we are in the end see you know some if we went above um don't put it on me okay I have to get familiar uh foreign you can come to church that's true [Music] [Applause] let's sing this song before we dismiss there shall be Showers of blessing this is the promise of love love there shall be Seasons refreshing sent from the Savior about Shout showers playing Showers of blessing we need Mercy drops around us for the showers we bleed [Music] oh Showers of blessing Showers of blessing we need foreign but for the showers we plead there shall be showers blessing precious Reviving again over the hills and The Vibes please sound of abundance of rain oh Showers of blessing Showers of blessing we need [Music] jobs around us or falling but for the showers we please there shall be Showers of blessing send them Upon Us O Lord grant to us now where we refreshing coming now on Earth Thy word Showers of blessing we need Mercy drops around us but for the showers we please there shall be Showers of blessing all that today they might fall now is to God we're confessing now is on Jesus we go shy words of blessing showers or blessing we need
