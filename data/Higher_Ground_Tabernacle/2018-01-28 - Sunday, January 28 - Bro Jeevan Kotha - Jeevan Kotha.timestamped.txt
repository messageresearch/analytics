[36:30] precious brothers and sister this is my
[36:33] 34 years coming to this country 34 years
[36:37] and but till today I couldn't catch the
[36:43] accents of the American people I'm sorry
[36:47] about that you know but I need your
[36:49] prayers English is not English is not my
[36:51] mother tongue brother Keith you know and
[36:52] so sometimes I struggle you know but
[36:55] thank God for His grace and mercy you
[36:57] know and he's keeping me praise the name
[37:00] of the Lord before I go to the scripture
[37:03] I want to bring some of the things
[37:06] concerning the country of India I
[37:09] present the present government in India
[37:11] they're very very bad you know to the
[37:17] Christians they are not for Christianity
[37:20] and they want to wipe out Christianity
[37:23] by 2021 22 all these years it was a
[37:28] different government and of course they
[37:32] were also Hindus but they were a good
[37:34] Hindus and they gave freedom to each and
[37:36] every religion in that country there are
[37:38] so many religions in India so many
[37:41] languages so many cultures you know so
[37:44] many you know many everything many many
[37:47] gods and you know so India is not a new
[37:52] country if you read in the book of
[37:54] Esther King Ahasuerus was ruling 127
[37:59] provinces from India to Ethiopia you'll
[38:03] find it in the book of Esther chapter
[38:04] one praise the name of the Lord so land
[38:07] is land wise it is smaller than the
[38:09] United States but the population wise
[38:11] you know it's very you know it's one
[38:14] half-billion you know one and a half
[38:17] billion officially Chinese first but you
[38:21] know Chinese controlling and but India a
[38:24] religion won't allow them to control you
[38:26] know so we have one-and-a-half billion
[38:29] more than one and a half billion because
[38:31] thousands are born in the countryside
[38:33] where there is no hospitals they're born
[38:36] at home and they're not registered with
[38:39] the government you know so that way I
[38:40] say you know we are number one
[38:42] unofficially number one in the world
[38:44] majority wise you know so anyhow now
[38:49] this present government they want to
[38:52] wipe out Christianity by 2020 122
[38:55] they're killing a lot of Christians lot
[38:58] of pastors burning churches burning
[39:01] Bibles and you know we used to have you
[39:05] know open-air meetings you know in the
[39:07] open area you know once once we're in
[39:10] the meetings one brother billions came
[39:12] to India it was eleven thousand people
[39:14] you know the next time he came we had a
[39:16] special meeting it was a thirteen
[39:18] thousand people you know but nowadays we
[39:21] can't have you know that kind of
[39:23] meetings in India you know anyhow i
[39:25] anointed as Isaiah to come and visit us
[39:27] we can have it a wonderful prayer
[39:30] meetings in the in the church you know
[39:32] not blessed us with a wonderful
[39:34] wonderful place and praise the name of
[39:36] the Lord if anybody wants to come to
[39:38] India you're most welcome only thing you
[39:40] need a visa to come to India and you
[39:44] never to say that you are going to
[39:45] preach but you are coming to visit
[39:47] friends you know there's no problem so
[39:49] anyhow you know they are deadly against
[39:53] Christianity and they are deadly against
[39:56] Muslim people also and you know
[39:58] Christians we keep quiet like Jesus said
[40:01] you know if one if somebody slaps you on
[40:03] one cheek give another chick so you know
[40:05] but but you know Muslims they're not
[40:08] going to keep quiet
[40:09] they're waiting for the revenge you know
[40:11] and we have second majority eighty
[40:13] percent majority goes to Hinduism now
[40:17] Hinduism means the hedonism
[40:18] you know they believe in many gods many
[40:21] gods
[40:22] there is a saying they believe in 33
[40:25] millions gods and goddesses
[40:28] don't ask with her names I don't know
[40:32] and then second majority goes to Muslims
[40:36] Islamic people and the third a majority
[40:39] a 50/50 percent majority that goes to
[40:42] Muslim people and then five percent
[40:45] Christianity and the majority goes to
[40:48] Catholic Church you know and Catholics
[40:50] are big everywhere you know so anyhow we
[40:53] have all the denominations in India what
[40:56] do you have here you know so anyhow
[40:59] please pray for the Christians in India
[41:02] many Christians they're slaughtered you
[41:05] know you know one of our one of our
[41:08] pastor recently last one 28 he was
[41:12] having prayer meeting at Easter at this
[41:14] place you know and there was about 50 60
[41:17] people were there you know then that's
[41:19] the time you know anti anti Christian
[41:22] organization came and that organization
[41:25] they believe in the monkey god they
[41:27] worship monkey God you know we have
[41:29] Monkey God temples we have an elephant
[41:31] to God temples all over India we have a
[41:34] woman goddess temples we have a lot of
[41:36] temples you know in the country of India
[41:39] you know and even that hedonism is
[41:41] coming here also I don't know whether
[41:44] you noticed or not you know in big
[41:46] cities like said you know Los Angeles
[41:49] and you know Detroit and New York many
[41:52] many you know temples are there Hindu
[41:56] temples and many Muslim mosques are
[41:58] there you know and so it's it's coming
[42:00] all over the world you know and the
[42:02] Prophet said this is you know this is
[42:05] the this is the Saturn's Eden we are we
[42:08] are dwelling in a Saturn's Eden you know
[42:10] and very soon the redemption is drawing
[42:11] nigh to us you know very soon we are
[42:14] real we are going to leave this place
[42:15] this is not a permanent place for us
[42:18] this is not perfect place for the bride
[42:21] of Jesus Christ our kingdom is coming
[42:24] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[42:26] we are waiting for that we are trusting

[1:08:34] have no right to talk they were bound
[1:08:40] 430 years but they were crying to God
[1:08:46] and God heard their cry and said Moses
[1:08:52] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:08:55] when the mighty hand with a great power
[1:08:58] with the great miracles brought them out
[1:09:03] of Egypt trace the name of the Lord
[1:09:08] brought them out set them free that's
[1:09:13] what you know
[1:09:14] but what happened they've forgotten what
[1:09:17] God has done in their lives and that's
[1:09:20] what we are doing now with the
[1:09:21] expression rather than justice we are
[1:09:23] forgetting the Lord they are not giving
[1:09:27] him due honor they forgotten that's why
[1:09:33] the psalmist says here some 106 7 to 15
[1:09:37] our fathers understood not died wonders
[1:09:40] in Egypt they remembered not the multi
[1:09:44] multitude of thy mercies our God is a
[1:09:47] great God having so many you know ways
[1:09:52] you know his mercies with us but
[1:09:55] provoked him at the sea even at the Red
[1:09:58] Sea nevertheless he served them for his
[1:10:02] name's sake yea he saved us for his
[1:10:07] name's sake we remember that do you know
[1:10:09] that not because of our righteousness
[1:10:12] not because we are very good you know
[1:10:15] but he saved us for his name's sake
[1:10:18] don't forget that you are saved by grace
[1:10:23] we are all saved by grace not because
[1:10:27] we've been righteous Oh hallelujah
[1:10:30] praise the name of the Lord and he saved
[1:10:33] them from the last from the hand of them
[1:10:35] that hated them and reamed them from the
[1:10:40] hand of the enemy no I missed something
[1:10:45] here nevertheless he saved them for his
[1:10:49] namesake that he might make his mighty
[1:10:51] power to be known
[1:10:53] he removed the Red Sea also and it was
[1:10:57] dried up so he led them through the
[1:10:59] depths and through the wilderness and he
[1:11:03] saved them from the hand of him that
[1:11:05] aided them and relieve them from the end
[1:11:08] of the enemy he has done same thing with
[1:11:14] us also he redeemed us from the hand of
[1:11:17] the enemy our enemy is the devil
[1:11:21] thank God for His grace and mercy and
[1:11:25] the waters covered their enemies
[1:11:27] there was not one of them left they
[1:11:31] believed they his words they're saying
[1:11:33] his place they'd soon forget his works
[1:11:38] they forgot his works they waited not
[1:11:43] for his concert but lusted exceedingly
[1:11:46] in the wilderness and tempted God in the
[1:11:49] desert and he gave them their request
[1:11:51] but sent leanness into their soul people
[1:11:56] forgotten in Exodus chapter 14 verse 31
[1:12:00] says and is that I saw that great work
[1:12:02] which the Lord did upon the Egyptians
[1:12:04] and the people feared the Lord and
[1:12:06] believed the Lord and his servant after
[1:12:09] you know after the Red Sea you know and
[1:12:14] the reason she was divided the sort of
[1:12:17] miracle did they started believing you
[1:12:19] know what they forgot Oh hallelujah
[1:12:23] praise the name of the Lord Moses that
[1:12:27] endurance seeing him who is invisible
[1:12:30] exactly the opposite was true the
[1:12:33] children of Israel in this record they
[1:12:36] endured only when the circumstances were
[1:12:38] favourable hmm they allowed him they
[1:12:43] praised him only when the circumstances
[1:12:45] were favorable they were largely
[1:12:50] governed by the things that appealed to
[1:12:53] their senses in place of resting in the
[1:12:57] invisible the eternal God today we need
[1:13:01] to rest in God praise the name of the
[1:13:04] Lord we need to praise Him we need to
[1:13:07] worship Him we need to magnifies them we
[1:13:09] need to exalt his name praise the name
[1:13:12] of the Lord hallelujah don't forget we
[1:13:15] are where we are in the same compartment
[1:13:18] like Enoch Enoch was a great man of God
[1:13:23] there was three
[1:13:25] special qualities in his life three
[1:13:30] special qualities in his life and that's
[1:13:34] the reason God took him away alive and
[1:13:38] we are waiting for the same thing we are
[1:13:42] ready for the rapture we are waiting for
[1:13:45] the change of a bodies but there are
[1:13:48] three important things like in Enochs
[1:13:51] life we have to do number one my Bible
[1:13:55] says Enoch walked with God today if you
[1:14:02] want to go in the rapture if you want to
[1:14:04] inherit God's kingdom you need to walk
[1:14:10] not by words you know the tower deeds we
[1:14:17] need to walk with Jesus we need to walk
[1:14:20] with God praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:23] number one called it he walked with God
[1:14:28] number two he was pleasing God we have
[1:14:33] to please him just like a wife please
[1:14:37] her husband the Book of Isaiah says your
[1:14:43] creator is your husband our Creator is
[1:14:48] our husband that's why I said I am the I
[1:14:50] will be the queen of the coming kingdom
[1:14:53] royal crown is waiting for me there for
[1:14:56] me and you praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:58] hallelujah walk with your husband trust
[1:15:02] in him love him
[1:15:04] respect him glorify Him that is the duty
[1:15:11] of the wife praise the name of the Lord
[1:15:15] Enoch walked with God Enoch was pleasing
[1:15:19] God in every step and the third
[1:15:24] he was witnessing about God he was
[1:15:29] witnessing about God today our job is to
[1:15:33] witness to others about Jesus sharing
[1:15:38] the love of Jesus Christ with others
[1:15:40] share what God has done in your life to
[1:15:45] others do not shut your mouth open let
[1:15:51] us open our mouth and speak to our
[1:15:54] neighbors our friends praise the name of
[1:15:57] the talk with them that's that's what
[1:16:02] that precious sister put a song let's
[1:16:05] talk about Jesus let's talk about Jesus
[1:16:08] I like that song

[1:16:12] about Jesus let's share the love of
[1:16:15] Jesus Christ with others praise the name
[1:16:18] of the Lord hallelujah so we are waiting
[1:16:22] for the change of our bodies we are
[1:16:25] waiting for the rapture
[1:16:29] anyhow faith is very important believe
[1:16:35] in God believe in him to see the great
[1:16:38] miracles in the present that in the
[1:16:42] present day there are those who live
[1:16:44] intermittent Christian lives because
[1:16:49] they have become occupied with the
[1:16:52] outward and center in circumstances in
[1:16:56] place of centering in God instead of
[1:16:59] centering in God you know I'm sorry to

[1:18:15] children of Israel then they believed
[1:18:18] his words they did not believe till
[1:18:21] after they saw when they saw him work
[1:18:26] then they believed God is not interested
[1:18:30] in those kind of people God wanted them
[1:18:33] to believe first to see the miracles of
[1:18:36] God praise the name of the Lord
[1:18:39] hallelujah whom he had we read of the
[1:18:41] children of Israel then they believed

[1:19:27] leader pearl

[1:19:34] this kind of faith it was a faith that
[1:19:38] depended upon circumstances this is not

[1:25:56] light the red light is Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:01] now people are
[1:26:03] very very light you know very simple
[1:26:06] talking against the Prophet he never
[1:26:11] done any harm to anybody can you show me
[1:26:14] one place where brother Brandenburg than
[1:26:16] any hurt anybody's feelings or or he
[1:26:19] done anything wrong to them he spoke the
[1:26:22] truth he was a humblest person upon this
[1:26:26] rd allah the exalted exalted the name of
[1:26:29] God Jesus he'd never done any harm to
[1:26:34] anybody so why people should talk
[1:26:36] against him when you do that the Word of
[1:26:41] God says do not touch my anointed by
[1:26:43] word or deed do not touch my anointed by
[1:26:46] word or deed
[1:26:48] there you are landed in trouble and then
[1:26:55] the thing I want to say brother Isaac
[1:26:57] you know this message never belongs to
[1:27:00] brother William Marion Branham this
[1:27:05] message belongs to the Holy Ghost then
[1:27:10] you try to find a mistake you rate the
[1:27:11] message you are trying to find mistake
[1:27:14] with the Holy Ghost and the Bible says
[1:27:16] if you talk against the Holy Ghost there
[1:27:18] is no forgiveness here or there so what
[1:27:22] you are going to do by changing the
[1:27:25] Prophet by judging the message you have
[1:27:29] let you landed in great trauma
[1:27:30] I'm generally talking Christian brothers
[1:27:32] and sisters because there is a situation
[1:27:34] in the message circle you know they're
[1:27:38] trying to talk against the Prophet he
[1:27:42] never done any harm to anybody trying to
[1:27:45] find mistakes with the message by
[1:27:47] finding fault with the Holy Ghost that's
[1:27:50] dangerous

[1:28:35] taking God at His Word taking God at His
[1:28:39] Word now what is faith faith is the
[1:28:43] substance if the substance of the things
[1:28:46] hoped for and the evidence of the things
[1:28:50] you do not see see taste fail smell all
[1:28:57] here there's none of the senses declare
[1:29:01] it yet the sixth sense which is faith do
[1:29:05] you have six cents called faith FAI th
[1:29:11] faith let God help us the outside Wayne
[1:29:17] is governed by five senses see taste
[1:29:23] fill smell and hear the inside man is
[1:29:29] governed by two senses either faith or
[1:29:34] unbelief see how to judge yourself
[1:29:38] whether you are governed by the faith or
[1:29:40] unbeliever if you believe it
[1:29:45] if just as real to you as if any of the
[1:29:48] natural senses of the body declare it
[1:29:50] and truly these senses of the body can
[1:29:54] be fooled but faith is absolutely
[1:29:56] invaluable praise the name of the Lord
[1:30:04] come on being misunderstood prophet
[1:30:07] priest and 61 they said doctor lady
[1:30:12] patient about her growth lady was called
[1:30:15] by the prophet and was healed instantly
[1:30:18] doctor didn't believe see
[1:30:22] is not believing faith is the substance
[1:30:25] of the things you don't see you believe
[1:30:28] it first then it happens the men was not
[1:30:32] a believer so therefore it was all
