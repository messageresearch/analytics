You may have your seat for a moment. &gt;&gt; Um, I was supposed to sing a song. I I've always heard people saying that, but since it was in Chiluba, I didn't really understand the song. The last time I was in Kentucky, I think someone sang that in Chiluba and they had the English English translation. &gt;&gt; And I really love the lyrics of that song. &gt;&gt; I didn't have time to add the English version, but so forgive me for that. And I believe cuz I asked the musician yesterday to practice the song &gt;&gt; cuz God just put that song on my heart. And they're telling me that they also had practiced that already because someone else was supposed to sing that to me. So I like when God moves like that. So Diego, can you help me sing &gt;&gt; just because I don't really I don't want to pronounce things the wrong way, but uh we will try. That's Lord, [singing] [music] [singing] [music and singing] you're w Zamby. [music and singing] [music and singing] [music and singing] [music] [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Tell me what [music] morning. [music] [music and singing] Yo yo yo [music] Zamb [music] [music] [singing] [music] yo yo. &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; might be [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; You meant [music] [singing] [music] [singing] your [music] King [singing] [music] of all [music] [music and singing] might. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; people. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] there [music] [singing] y [music] Without music sing [music] [singing] [music] [music] [singing] Oh &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Y. [music] [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think chilobo means almighty, right? You know, I love songs that magnify Jesus, you know. Jesus is the almighty, you know, and then I think it means big a big god, you know. He's he's all big. He's he's grand you know of all the gods &gt;&gt; not just of he's the he's bigger than even your problems you know anything you name my god is bigger than that you know and what I love the most I think is the last verse that says the god to call in the time of trouble remember whenever you get in trouble call on god I don't really know If I know the second line, what does that mean? &gt;&gt; You know, you call him toenge. &gt;&gt; You ch you have to challenge God. Is that what he says? &gt;&gt; Okay. When there's a challenge, you call on God. And even if the battle rages on, to him it is light. That's the God of the message of the hour. You may stand to your feet. Thank you. Thank you, Diego, for the song. &gt;&gt; I always get very nervous when I get up here. I'm shaking if you can see that. But I pray that God will help me. &gt;&gt; So, let's turn to Acts chapter 2, &gt;&gt; verse 37. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Now when they were Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. So the promise is yours. You just have to take it. Let's go to Malachi chapter 4 verse 5-6. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 vers 5-6. &gt;&gt; Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head. If you have any just raise your hands to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, you are the great Chilobo, the great almighty. And heavenly father, Lord, you created everything that exists. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we are the works of your creation as well. We bow ourselves before you Lord. Heavenly father Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord we thank you for giving us uh strength to come into your house this morning. And heavenly father Lord you promised us in your word that wherever two or three are gathered in your name, you shall be in the midst of them. Lord, we thank you for your promise and we believe that you are here. Lord, I pray that you forgive us of our shortcomings and that heavenly father, Lord, you may have the preminence throughout the whole service. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you take control of everybody starting from me to the to the back of the church, Lord Jesus. And anything that doesn't confess your name, we rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, Lord, your children raise their hands and they have needs and requests. You know them all, Father. I pray, Lord, that you answer. You give them what their hearts desire in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord God, I surrender myself to you. I surrender this vessel, my heart, my soul, my mind, my mouth, everything. Lord Jesus, bless the reading of your word and anoint the preaching. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. My title for today will be &gt;&gt; back to true repentance. And I was supposed to continue my series on what is the message of the hour. But somehow just yesterday when I was studying, I just wasn't feeling it. It just felt like I was forcing something. And then I was like, "Okay, maybe let me try to see if I have another sermon." And I went into another sermon. I still couldn't feel it. &gt;&gt; I almost called one of the ministers very late at night to just ask, "Hey, if they can just preach today because I just wasn't feeling it." Because I don't like the way I prepare. I don't like forcing things, you know? Usually when God usually all my sermons, God God just gives me all the scriptures and all the quotes. It's like I can be praying and while I'm praying I just start preaching or I just like you have one scripture and then there are other scripture just uh just compulate till it becomes a whole sermon. But somehow those those ones I was just having difficulty coming up with a sermony &gt;&gt; and I decided to scroll through all my notes. and I saw this title back to true repentance. It wasn't fully developed, but then it just seems like I was at ease in this sermon. So, I believe that maybe God has this for us today and we trust he's going to bless. So, we just read Malachi chapter 4 5-6 and we also read the book of Acts chapter 2. It tells us that &gt;&gt; before the [clears throat] dreadful day of the Lord that I will send you Elijah the prophets. &gt;&gt; So we have a promise that God promised to send us the prophet Elijah. &gt;&gt; But what is his mission? His mission is to turn the heart of the children to their fathers. So in other words, it's to turn our hearts to the condition that our fathers in Acts chapter 2 had. Is to work on the hearts of the believers to get back to Acts chapter 2 because the prophet tells us that that they were our fathers. That's where Christianity was born. When they received the Holy Ghost. The prophet says that when you don't have the you're not even a true Christian, you're not fully converted until you receive the Holy Ghost. So Malachi 4 is telling us according to William Brham that he's supposed to take us back to Act chapter 2. Why was what was happening in chapter 2 of Acts? The preaching of the word was p piercing the hearts of men. The preaching of the word was causing people to repentance. They did not need to be babyed around. But they did not even they didn't even need to call for an altar call. The word convicted their hearts so much that the Bible says that when they heard these things they were pricricked in their hearts. So what is what is the mission of Malachi 4 is to take the believers to the position where the the word can penetrate your heart where the word can break your heart because what uh no let me not jump ahead of me. to take us back to that that key word in their hearts. &gt;&gt; I I believe many of us are baptized today. their hearts. And yet we say we believe the message of the hour. That's not the the same message that I READ UNLESS if you point me to another message. But the prophetly uh uh sorrow for repentance the prophet says I don't even believe that you can come to the altar to be prayed for with seen we we we want to see the move of God in this church because I know that once God promises one thing IT HAS TO HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I believe that with all my heart. So if I don't see the move of GOD IN THIS CHURCH, THEN SOMETHING IS WRONG SOMEWHERE. If I don't see the move of God in my life, THEN SOMETHING IS WRONG SOMEWHERE. Then we need to BE LIKE JOSHUA AND CALL FOR THE assembly of the saints. LET'S EXAMINE EACH HOUSE. WHAT IS WRONG IN THIS CHURCH THIS MORNING? LIKE JOSHUA, let's examine each and every one OF OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; THERE must be sin in the camp somewhere. &gt;&gt; You know, I have all these quotes here. The prophet Am I am I ready? If I'm just skipping, but the prophet says that if you have if you don't confess your sins, you can't even hinder someone else from being healed. &gt;&gt; People can come to the altar, they are prayed for, BUT THEY CANNOT BE HEALED. BECAUSE OF YOU. So you are selfish. You are selfish. &gt;&gt; If you if you don't want to get anywhere with God, then stop coming to church. Because if you because God can only work with you if you also desire him. If you also have a desire for GOD IN YOU. THIS CHURCH IS NOT A PICNIC. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T COME TO CHURCH to see each other. &gt;&gt; I come to church to to have an experience with God. I I I don't I I don't know about you, but I refuse to believe a message that doesn't have an impact in MY LIFE because then I'll just I'll rather just go to OTHER CHURCHES. I'LL JUST GO TO THE METHODIST CHURCH, THE BAPTIST CHURCH. SO WHY ARE YOU COMING HERE? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR DRESSES? You're wearing all these dress and now at school everybody has to look at you as this weird person wearing dresses. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't just want to wear a dress if I don't see the move of God in my life. &gt;&gt; I don't just want to not smoke if I don't see the move of God in my life. The Bible says these signs shall follow the believer, &gt;&gt; not the believer following the signs, but these signs shall follow the believer. So somehow &gt;&gt; you know sometimes you even hear brothers saying certain things like there are certain things I believe only brother Brandham &gt;&gt; certain things only brother Brandham &gt;&gt; or even or even like some people don't even believe in angels appearing to people to be brother Brandham but brother Brandham preached that angels can appear to you if you are very consecrated WITH GOD SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN BELIEVE in hearing the audible voice of God that only brother that's not the message that we heard that's putting God in a box so what if God comes and want that speak to you through an audible voice you're going to say no that's not you only Brother, when the angel came down on earth on Revelation chapter 10, what did he do? He puts the hand the book in the hands of the bride. The book didn't just stay in the hand of brother Brandham. It came in the hand of the bride. What is that book? It gives you the legal authority of the word. &gt;&gt; So if you have the authority of the word, then you have the same authority that brother Brandham had because who is greater? Is brother Brandham greater THAN THE WORD? THE WORD IS above the prophets. Brother Brandham says there's a difference between Jesus and Adi THE PROPHETS. BROTHER SAYS THAT Jesus was the word but we PROPHETS THE WORD COME to us. HE SAYS WE ARE not the word but the word comes to us. You need to know who you are. [applause] You are not just a nobody. God still speaks through an audible voice. He may not He has never done that to me. But I'm not going to put him IN A BOX. I WANT THE SAME God of Malachi 4 to also be in action in my life. And if he's not there, it's either two things. It's either this message is false or something is wrong with your experience. But God already vindicated this message. We know this message is the truth. You know how so their faith was based on repentance. &gt;&gt; You know that's the first first step to repentance is a godly sorrow for the sin committed. So you need to be sorry about what you committed. Don't raise your hand but how many here I've been seeking for the Holy Ghost. You have been baptized. You try to pray and everything. But why don't you have the Holy Ghost? I believe I have that quote to you. Let me just read it real quick cuz sometime it's better if I just read from the prophets than saying that myself. &gt;&gt; Okay. It's in a message. He cares. Do you care? The prophet says, "When you thoroughly repent and believe on the Lord &gt;&gt; and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you make God a liar if you don't receive the Holy Ghost." That's the prophet. &gt;&gt; But he says the key word is when you thoroughly repent. What is a thorough repentance? It's in a sincere deep repentance. &gt;&gt; What is that repentance? It's the repentance that pricks the heart. &gt;&gt; You know, make wanting to make things right. So the first step to repentance, you have to be sorry for the sin that you committed. You did something and you are very like you know to be prick in your heart you take a knife here someone heart I don't know has someone ever hurt you so much that your heart you feel like something your heart that's how you should feel when you commit sin according to Acts chapter 2 that's the first step get to that stage age first where you are convicted in your heart. &gt;&gt; Then there are two things. If you hurt someone or you did something wrong against someone you have to make it right with that person first. If you have someone that you you have you don't speak to you have you are enemy with someone you see that person and you don't greet them &gt;&gt; purposely you will not get anywhere well with God let me even tell you you are wasting time even praying you are wasting your So that 30 minutes or actually maybe five minutes that you end you spend praying you know maybe just go and do your own thing because you are actually wasting your time. I read you the quotes. The prophet says you are wasting your time. Like I said we we have to re you know when something is wrong go to the source. The prophet says when something is wrong, you have to first diagnose what what is the cause of it. That's what we're doing this morning. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be hurtful. This is speaking to me too. If you have an art against someone, you are wasting your time praying. Even when we are here singing, your hand raised doesn't mean anything to God. He doesn't even see your hand. So why are you even here if God is not even you know the prophet says that God told them that when people came to the altar he told them that make them confess everything they have done first before they come. Let me let me read that quote first. Let me see. Um, he cares. Do you care? Paragraph 63. So, if you go to paragraph 63, the prophet says, &gt;&gt; I think one of the things that keeps our people from being healed is the lack of confession. Is the lack of sincere confession. He says, now for instance, this sound this might sound a little bad, but I don't mean it in this way. look looking at my wife sitting here. If I'll go out here today and throw my arms around some other woman and make love to her and I was wrong. Of course, my confidence will keep me from doing that. But if it happened that I did or anything similar to it and then I know the first thing is to say to my wife before I can say to God forgive me because I sinned against her. So if you have sinned against someone before you give even go to God and ask God to forgive you go repair with that person first. And if you come to the altar and remember you have ought make that right first before you offer your gift. So I've got to go to her. I've got to go to her. I believe in confession is straightening up also. It isn't. So it isn't true confession unless it is So if you don't to if you don't straighten up your life, you don't go repair all the damages that you've caused. According to the prophets, you have not repented. You have not confessed, right? He won't even call it a confession. WHAT if I say I'm going to confess it that I done wrong? I said, "Good Lord." Oh, friend of mine. &gt;&gt; You know that I know you real well. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think you're a good old fellow. Forgive me. I didn't mean it that way. &gt;&gt; Now you say that's sacrilegious. &gt;&gt; To make a confession like that. &gt;&gt; You don't go to God as if like you didn't even didn't even do anything. Oh God, I love you. You are my Lord. You are my friend. You know, I didn't mean to just forgive me like that. The prophet says, that's not how you go ask. And he takes it even further. He says, but what if I go say, Lord, I didn't mean to do it just that way, and you help me and I won't do it again. He will refuse my sacrifice. until I first go and make that right with my wife. I believe we are all message believers this morning. And you are reading the prophet and I trust that you go apply that in your life. He's saying that God will refuse your sacrifice unless you go make that right with your wife. But also now you go to make it right with your wife. But look at the attitude in which you are going to make it rightitude. Then what if I come to her with the same irreverence and say irreverence and say say old girl old friend of mine old mother of my children old sweetheart you know we've been old charms for a long time. What if I put my arms around another woman? &gt;&gt; So you So you start by, you know, not making making it seem as if it's yours first. &gt;&gt; Oh, sweetheart, what would you do if actually if I cheated on you? Because you want to first see her reaction, you know. Was where was I? Yeah. So I imagine how she'll look. She'll think what's happened to my husband. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 69. &gt;&gt; And you don't go that way to make a confession to your fellow man or God. So if I do something wrong to someone, I don't just go, you know, there's a thing with my siblings. Sometimes when we we hurt each other, because of pride. &gt;&gt; Even when you go confess to your sibling to ask to forgive you, &gt;&gt; I won't mention no names, but I just know sometimes they'll come to the room, they just open a room, they're like, "Uh, you know what happened yesterday? Forgive me." And they close the door and then that's not true confession. No, actually I believe through confession you sit with the person and you you you show remorse. &gt;&gt; You know, yesterday I really didn't mean to do it. But I did it. Would you forgive me? You don't close the door and you leave it because you know too much pride. I mean, I'm guilty of that. I've done that, too. But the message is here to to to make sure we do things the right way. And that's why I'm teaching you this morning, you know, how to repent. He says you go with the depths of sincerity with godly sorrow for of your sin. First, you must be sorry. &gt;&gt; So don't just go ask someone to forgive you. Just because yeah, if I don't ask him, God is not going to hear my prayer. &gt;&gt; No, you have to be sorry. &gt;&gt; You know, and let me just keep paragraph 70. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Uh then I've got to tell God the same way and tell both her and God with the sincerity that I'll never do it again by the grace of God. You know how you ask for forgiveness forgive me and pray for me you know and by the grace of God I will never do it again. That is a sincere uh confession if it comes from the heart. And the same paragraph the prophet says I must be deeply sincere with God and then if I am sincere he'll hear me. &gt;&gt; And now pay attention to this. He says but if I am not sincere there is no need of me wasting God's times listening to me. That's what I was saying earlier. &gt;&gt; Don't waste God's time. And also don't waste your own time. You know, at least God doesn't have time. God is eternal. &gt;&gt; But you here, you have a time. You know, &gt;&gt; it wasn't too long ago you were 5 years old, 10, 15, 20, and now you're already at that age. Time goes by fast. Don't waste your time. Nothing even guarantees you tomorrow. You know, but the another problem also with confession is people are very pricey. &gt;&gt; You don't want to go down and ask another person to forgive you. But you know, maybe you need to change your mindset because once you realize that all of us commit sins, &gt;&gt; all of us fall short, then you're not going to be prideful to go to that because you also recognize that person also can could have done the same thing. That's why God says, I will remove this stony heart out of you. Lord remove the stony hearts. The stony means stubborn heart. The word comes and preach and preach but you don't change. I don't know the condition of this church. For instance, I hope there's no one. I don't I hope we don't have enemies in this church. I really hope so. And if we do, how long have you been enemies with that person? But yet you come to church &gt;&gt; and you rejoice under the word. &gt;&gt; I I really I don't know God is my witness. But I hope we don't have people that have enemies because let me tell you if you have an odd against someone you may be a hindrance to the move of God in this church. So if you don't make it right with a person, I'm begging you, please don't come to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that &gt;&gt; you I don't know if I already read it, but if not, I already read it. You know, he I don't know the key word, but it's somewhere in my notes here. So if you that's why in some churches when you do certain things they ask you to stay home first till you make it right why do they do it God is the same God had given a promise to the children of Israel that they would overcome but because of sin in the camp he made the promise of God to no effect &gt;&gt; and they had to go dig it out and get it out of the camp. Then then they started overcoming and you think God is going to change with you. The prophet says God is not a respector of a person. So that's why if you cannot make your life right especially for years or months months of coming to this church go home ask God to work on your heart but don't come to church like that we are coming to church to be blessed &gt;&gt; we don't come to church to be cursed and stop being selfish. &gt;&gt; No, I don't I don't think this is in my notes, but I really hope we don't have anybody that has enemies. This is God speaking to you if you want. &gt;&gt; It's better for you to stop coming to church than coming to church in that condition. You know people are too comfortable with stuff like that. How do you even get on your knees and even pray the Bible? Do you do we read the same Bible? &gt;&gt; The Bible tells me that we will know that you are my disciples for the love that you have one for another. And what is the love? The prophet explained to us what that love is. He says that love is not when someone does good to you. Love is when someone is even willing to kill you if he was given A CHANCE, &gt;&gt; but you still love him. &gt;&gt; That's the love that Jesus was talking about. Brother Billy Paul says that the thing with brother Brandham. You couldn't even tell his enemies from his friends. So if we are his disciples, let's do the same way. If you have people that you know you don't have to be besties with everybody. We're not asking you to be best friends but be and then if you also think that that person is wrong still be Christian but go pray for that person. It's better for you to not come to church. you know while I'm on needs too &gt;&gt; this thing comes to my mind commun communion you know people are too comfortable with not making their life right with each other or God you know one thing that I've noticed about this church for years and it's a shame to the church that during communion I would say 5% or 10% of church still take communion Not one time, but every time since I was in Iowa City, &gt;&gt; I moved down here. Same thing. That's not what the message of the hour came to do. We are not to be stagnant in one place. I'm sorry. I'm preaching a message that's supposed to prick your heart because the word has to prick your heart, you know, because I want you to be in a good position with God where you can have a situation, you know, when when when a challenge comes your way, when a a problem comes your way, you the ministry is nowhere to be found, &gt;&gt; but you know that you're in a right place with God. And you have the right to go directly to God and ask him anything and he's obligated to give it to you. That's your right as a believer. That's your right. You know when Jesus died on Calvary, the veil was ripped into what that what does that mean? That means you have direct access to the father. But the Bible says if our heart condemns us not &gt;&gt; then we have confidence that he will hear us. So it's either the voice that we're preaching in the pulpit is not sharp enough to pierce your heart. But what are we preaching? We are just repeating the message. Turn the hearts of the of the children to their fathers. Turn our hearts where it can again be pricked. So now let me ask you think about this. This this is not in my notes but think about this. So you know when God was talk about Job, he was proud of Job. He invited Satan come see have you seen my servant Job? Now imagine God comes in this church. YOU KNOW THE PROPHET says God always keeps his appointment every time, every Sunday, every Wednesday, God is here in this church but we have not made him welcome. Now imagine God is like because the prophet also says that Satan also goes to church. [applause] [cheering] Now Satan is here and God is here. &gt;&gt; Now God is like oh my god how am I even going to Satan is there laughing and God doesn't even cannot even be proud of you. God doesn't So Satan is laughing at this church and God is God doesn't even know what to say because what is he going to say? Your life is not backing him up. Your life is not being a witness of the resurrection. Your life is being ashamed of the gospel. Somehow we are not being sincere with the message of the hour. WE SAY we believe it in the mouth. IT'S A SHAME THAT hogs tabernacle 5% of people take communion. Why is it a shame? Let me say why. Do you think that everybody that comes takes communion they everybody's perfect? Starting from the pastor to everybody. We all have fault. We believe in going to make things right. Especially, you know, the thing especially we warn you be before time. A week like a week before we like we're going to have communion service people come to church we have before communion we sing people raising chairs Jerusalem Jerus I've seen this in the church Jerusalem and then I'm sorry that's the word and then when it comes down to communion the pastor says if you are not you know not everybody has to take it you know if your heart is not right with God or if you don't feel comfortable, don't take it. Those people that were saying Jerusalem, walk out of the door, &gt;&gt; you know what that means? It grieves the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It graves the spirit of God. You remember the prophet had a vision where God show him every sin that he was committing &gt;&gt; and on that scene on that vision he could see Jesus was crying bloody tears. That's what's happening in this church every Sunday. &gt;&gt; Jesus come he so he's pretty much coming to a funeral. &gt;&gt; Jesus doesn't come happy in this church. THE BIBLE SAYS, "Grieve not the Holy Ghost." Grieve not the spirit of God. So the Holy Ghost can be grieved. What is grieving? When someone lose someone, you are grieving. You are crying. You are hurt. So maybe we shouldn't even invite Jesus in church. Why are we going to invite him just to come cry? believers, work on your hearts. &gt;&gt; You know, if you have something against someone, go make it right. Come and take communion. &gt;&gt; And if it's not against someone, something that you've done, the Bible says his mercy is on you every morning. So even if yesterday I committed something bad, this morning his mercy is new for me. So then I believe that because his word says so that when I get on my knees, Lord forgive me, he forgives you. Then when you are forgiven, he doesn't even see all the sins you committed. Then you come and you take communion, you know, please let's work on our heart. You know, it's it's like it's it's it's embarrassing even as a church. One time I was very embarrassed. I believe there was a new year service or something like that. And I think I talked about that to the pastor communion. We probably only like five or six, seven people there. Majority of the church gone. Now imagine if I bring a sinner in this church. I would be concerned. &gt;&gt; You know the problem is that it's not that it happened one time. It it happened time after time after time after time. Why can't you make your life right with God? Why? Why can't you make your heart work on your heart? That's that's the message today. The first step is repentance. The first step is your heart. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I don't mean to be hard, but I have to. &gt;&gt; You know, and after you've done all those things, the Bible says after we've done all this, now letting let God do the work. I wonder this just coming to my mind now. &gt;&gt; Is it that you don't take communion because the night before you drunk? But even that, &gt;&gt; you know, if you go and you ask God to forgive you, he will forgive you and you come and you take communion. Let's make God proud in this church. Let's change the narrative. You know, you know, I was I was uh reading this person, this Satanist. He used to be a satanist and he was converted to being a Christian. &gt;&gt; He spoke about Halloween, &gt;&gt; you know, he said that during Halloween, &gt;&gt; you know, when people celebrate Halloween, usually in those places, even if one house doesn't celebrate Halloween, &gt;&gt; but in that street there are a lot of demons that get stations there. You know, so those demons know which like which streets they can go to. And somehow demons know higher ground tabernacle. Higher ground tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Not for the good way, but the bad way. They know higher ground is. Oh, if you want to I I'll just go to higher ground tabernacle. &gt;&gt; I can sing. I can shout &gt;&gt; and I'll go home and I'll say I'm still a believer. &gt;&gt; Let's change that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's change that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's change that guys. Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, we're going to change this church. Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, you ought to let them go. Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, you ought to let them go. [applause and cheering] In the name of Jesus Christ, I reclaim your heart. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that God breaks the yolks of the stony heart in your life and give you a heart of flesh. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that God convicts your heart that you come to the altar, you go repair with your fellow brother and sister, make your life right with God in the name of Jesus Christ. The mercy of God is here &gt;&gt; for whomever will accept it. &gt;&gt; Examine your heart, Lord. What is he saying? Is he speaking to me? Lord, work on my heart. Change me. I want to turn. The prophet says repentance is turning around. You know, there are even people, you know, I don't believe everybody that drink really don't want to give that up. I believe there are some, they want to give it up, but they just can't. And I'm not here to preach you the dos and don'ts. You know, the prophet says that's the error with the believer that with the preaching We are to point back the people to Calvary. We are to point the people back to Jesus Christ. So if you have a desire to give it up, I'll read a quote here. There was a man that had he he had an habit of smoking cigarettes. He wanted to give that up, but he just couldn't. And he felt like he couldn't give his life to God because of that. The prophet says, "Don't even worry. Don't even mention cigarettes. &gt;&gt; The brother said, "I'm not even going to talk about that. Let's take you to the source. Let's take you to the person that can deliver you from that." And the prophet to led him to Jesus Christ. Let me read that. Okay. Yeah, I found it. So, uh, it's going to be a little bit lengthy, but in the message, the key to the door, paragraph 16, says &gt;&gt; he said, um, I guess it's just the church here tonight, but as far as I know, I'm not here in no, let me skip. I got a little criticism here not long ago on baptizing a man here in the He was an old fellow. &gt;&gt; I went to him. He was a good old man. &gt;&gt; Just because you smoke, you drink, doesn't mean you're bad. You You can be You can be You are a child of God, but you are bound in chains of sin. You are a good man. You are a good sister. I would even call you my brother. You know, he says, "I had the privilege of leading all of his family to Christ. This old man was a nice old man, and I liked him." So, I went to, you see, Jesus doesn't care about the condition of your life. You know, even the young ruler, Jesus loved him. And here, this prophet, this guy who smokes every day, but the prophet says, "I like this guy. He was a good person. And I said to him, "Papa, why don't you become a Christian?" You know what? Another thing that caught my attention here, even to us ministers, respect towards older people. The prophet was still a prophet, but he still called him papa. That's why Paul tells Timothy, when you rebuke all the people, rebuke them with, you know, respect. Papa, why don't you become a Christian? He loves me. He says, "Brother Brham, I would become a Christian when I can get good enough." Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Tell you what to do. What you do, papa? You look around till you find where you can get when you can get good enough. Then tell me where the places I want to go to." I said Christ never come to save a good man. [applause] &gt;&gt; Christ did not come to save. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come did not come. Christ did not come to save a good man. &gt;&gt; I am happy of that because I was not I'm not a good man. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I did not come for those that were already whole, but the physician came to those that need a physician. &gt;&gt; Lord, I am not a good man." So that means God is here for me this morning. If you believe yourself not to be a good man or a good woman, I'm here to tell you that Christ is here for you. He never came to save a good man, but he came to save bad men. Not decent men, but bad men. Lord, I am bad. Lord, I keep cheating on my wife. Lord, I keep lying. But in my hearts, I want to be right, but I just cannot seem to give up those things. I drink alcohol. I GET DRUNK, BUT I WANT TO GIVE IT UP. I LIE. I do all those things. I am here for you. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, forever, this morning. In the name of Jesus Christ, he's here to save you because he recognizes that you are not good. And he recognizes that on your own, you can never be good. You need Jesus Christ BECAUSE HE IS YOUR STRENGTH. HE IS YOUR ALL. All that you need is in Jesus Christ. He's your peace. He is your victory. Everything that I need in this journey is in Jesus Christ. The Bible says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me. I can overcome the spirit of alcohol through Christ who strengthen me. I can overcome the spirit of lust through Christ who strengthen me. I can overcome anything that comes against me through Christ who strengthen me BECAUSE HIS STRENGTH IS PERFECT &gt;&gt; and he's just all that I need. &gt;&gt; I can overcome. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can overcome &gt;&gt; because the living God has already overcome for me. &gt;&gt; I am not good. Li Paul IS NOT GOOD. I'M NOT A GOOD MAN. &gt;&gt; I NEED JESUS. Every hour of my life, I need Jesus. &gt;&gt; Every minute of my life, I need Jesus. &gt;&gt; I cannot go a second without Jesus. &gt;&gt; The second I go without Jesus, I fall. &gt;&gt; The second I go WITHOUT JESUS, I FALL. THE SECOND YOU GO WITHOUT CHRIST, YOU FALL. THE SECOND YOU GO WITHOUT JESUS, YOU FALL. &gt;&gt; I NEED HIM. The song says, "I need thee or I need thee every hour. I need you." &gt;&gt; Jesus, it's getting hard in this last age. &gt;&gt; It's getting HARD IN LEODIA. LORD, this morning it's getting harder to live as a Christian. I need you, Lord. I need you. Then you know when you need him, but when he shows up, you get to get into a place where you need Christ. Jesus would only get in your life when you are desperate for him. &gt;&gt; Get desperate for God. &gt;&gt; Let him see that he you really need him. Brother the Hebrew voice. The God they were walking to the fire. He He got to a place they were getting close to getting in the fire. Jesus back in heaven. He said, "My children need me. ON THEIR OWN, THEY'RE GOING TO BURN. &gt;&gt; They need me. They don't NEED MY ANGELS. THEY don't need just any any other person. They need me. Then we saw Jesus came down in the fire AND HE BECAME THE FOURTH man in the fire. When you need Jesus Christ, HE'S GOING TO BE THE fourth man in your fire. Daniel, he was thrown in the lion's den. GOD SAID &gt;&gt; THEY need me. He's like Daniel need me. So when did he do? He sent his angels. He shuts the mouth of the lions. I'M TELLING YOU, WHEN YOU need the Lord, he will shut the mouth of the lions. The Bible says the devil is roaring like a lion. But when you need God, the Bible says he's the most present help in times of trouble. When I'm in trouble, I need Jesus. THEN JESUS COMES and he shuts the mouth of THE OF THE LION. OH LORD, I have all the demons around me. Oh Lord, I have all these lions around me. You're the God of Daniel. Search the mouth of those lions. Oh, I have all these troubles against me. I have all these weapons to form against me. BUT YOU SAID that no weapons FORM AGAINST ME WILL PROSPER. WHY? BECAUSE I need you. I need you, Lord, this morning. I need you, Lord, this morning. This church needs YOU, LORD. WE ARE CRYING OUT FOR YOU, LORD JESUS. WE ARE CRYING OUT for an outpouring OF THE HOLY GHOST. LORD, I NEED YOU. I confess every hour, I need you. That's when Jesus comes. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm a bad man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am a bad man. And I need the good man to save the bad man. &gt;&gt; You know it depends on what you are seeing. &gt;&gt; You know Barabbas &gt;&gt; he was about to get executed. &gt;&gt; Barabas was a murderer. He was a bad man and his day for exe execution came &gt;&gt; and he was already making his last prayer. Just like John &gt;&gt; when no one was ready to open the book, &gt;&gt; John started crying. The prophet says because he believed that was going to be the end of everything that was going to be the execution of John. Then at the last minute, someone comes to the door. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They open the door and Barabas all sees in the door and he thinks they're taking him to get uh executed. THEY SAID, "YOU ARE FREE, BARABAS. YOU ARE FREE. BARABUS. Barabus didn't know. Barabus is LIKE, "OH MY GOD, WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M FREE?" They say, "Look over there. LOOK ON THE CROSS. THERE IS SOMEONE THERE. HE TOOK YOUR PLACE. LOOK ON THE CROSS, BARABUS. YOU ARE FREE." &gt;&gt; THIS MORNING, &gt;&gt; I was in lost in sin. shackles with the shackles of sin. The demon is cutting my flesh left and right. But then I hear a VOICE THAT SAY, "You are free." I hear a voice that says, "YOU ARE FREE. LOOK AT CALVARY. HIGH GROUND TABERNACLE. LOOK AT CALVARY. &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST was he died on the cross so you can be free. You are a bad man. YOU ARE A BAD WOMAN. But Jesus Christ, the only good person, he took YOUR PLACE, YOU WILL NOT DIE. THAT'S WHY THE Bible says if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, you have eternal life. If you believe on the message OF THE HOUR, YOU WILL NOT DIE. YOU WILL NOT PERISH. The devil meant HARM FOR YOU. BUT GOD HAS TURNED IT FOR YOUR GOOD. GOD MEANS prosperity for you. &gt;&gt; Your sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; I stand as Barabus. I was headed toward sin, &gt;&gt; but Christ took my place. &gt;&gt; But it's up for you to accept it this morning. There is enough room at the cross for each and every ONE OF YOU. THANK YOU JESUS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S enough room for each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; What does the song says? Is there room at the cross? &gt;&gt; Yes, there is room. If there was room for brother Brham, brother Brham was supposed to be also a murderer. He was going to shoot someone and he was going to be sent in jail. But grace made a way for him. There was room for brother Brandham. There is room for you. There is room for me this morning. Jesus is here to make sure you are changed from being a bad man to a good man. Amen. There is room at the cross. &gt;&gt; Change my heart. &gt;&gt; Let me continue. &gt;&gt; He says, yeah, he says uh tell you I want to go to Christ never come to save a good man. He came to save a bad man. When you think you are good, &gt;&gt; then he didn't come to save you. &gt;&gt; Who are the bad people this morning? Christ is here to save you. &gt;&gt; The prophet says when you think you are good then maybe start become a Muslim actually. When you think you are good become a Buddhist because Jesus is not there for you. Jesus is here for me because I'm bad. Look at all the people that God had to deal with. &gt;&gt; Are you going to say David was a good man? He was so bad to the point that God would not even allow him to build the temple. &gt;&gt; Everybody that got it, Paul was a murderer. &gt;&gt; He witnessed the murder of Steven. But I'm glad that that God doesn't look at that. DO YOU KNOW WHY? WHY God does come for you? is because you were in his thought before the foundation of the world. That's why God is coming for you. HE WILL NOT leave one behind. God doesn't care ABOUT WHAT YOU DO. He cared about his germ of life that he put inside of you before the foundation of the world. And now you are his thought expressed. &gt;&gt; When you think you're good, he didn't come to save you. He come to save them that he knows are bad. Oh Lord, do you know if I'm bad? Lord, do you know that I'm bad? Lord, come. Lord, come. Christ died to save sinners. I said, "Papa, there's a line right here." He said, "Well, I smoke these cigarettes." You know the issue, the problem we do? Oh my god, yesterday I just lasted. &gt;&gt; I just did something bad. I just drank. &gt;&gt; Am I [clears throat] good enough? &gt;&gt; I smoke these cigarettes. How can God save me? I said, "I ain't going to even talk." The prophet says, "I'm not even going to talk about them." He said, "I've tried to give them my brother Bran." Brother says, "We ain't going to talk about it." That's the thing. When you come to God, he's not going to talk about your past life because he's there to change you. &gt;&gt; So come this morning. There's a song say just as I am, I come to you. God is here to change you. We're not going to talk about that. When you come up here, I'm not going to talk about that. If you want to change, you come, you say, "Pray for me. I want to change." I'm not going to talk about your struggles &gt;&gt; because I know that I have to lead you to the person that has overcome all the struggles. You know, he even overcame hell. &gt;&gt; So, what is that thing that's too hard for God? What are you scared of? You're not going to go to hell. You are not going to go to hell. You are from heaven. You came from heaven and you are going to return back to heaven. You came from God and you are going to return back to God. &gt;&gt; He he said u um don't say don't say no more about them. Let them go. I want to ask you a question. He said he said all right. What is it? I said do you believe there is a God? Said certainly I believe it. Do you believe there is a God? &gt;&gt; Believe it. Do you believe that the same God crossed his strength and was made flesh and dwelt dwelt among us in the person of Jesus Christ in order to save men? He said, "Yes, I believe." So that's a question I'm asking you to save sinners like you are and like see. Yes, I believe that. I'm asking you, do you believe that Christ came to save sinners like you and me? If you believe that from your heart, pairing of 22 and I said now it's it's just like this, we are all in one big building over here and we are in jail and I can't stand over in this corner and say this will help me get out of jail. I stand over in that corner and say that will help me get out of jail. We are all in the same fix. &gt;&gt; And every man that was born in this world was born in sin and shaped in iniquity. &gt;&gt; Come to the world speaking life. He &gt;&gt; is a renegade to begin with. Now paragraph 128 28. I want to say something. Every man in this prison house who is holy? Who is the one that wasn't born by sex? Who is one that can help the other no matter what he is? &gt;&gt; We are in the same prison. &gt;&gt; But God made himself one of his creation and come beyond beyond that. You know through the blood and he redeemed us. Do you believe that? I'm asking you do you believe that? He said, "I believe that." And I said, "Christ died for bad men like you." Now, there's only one way to do. There's nothing you can do. He offers it to you. This is free to you. You can't merit it. Nothing you can do to get it. He just gives it to you. Will you accept what he did for you to keep you from hell? He said, "I'll do that." &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, would you accept what Christ has done for you to keep you from hell? He's not going to answer it for you. You have to answer it yourself. But he got back against he said, "But if I could just get rid of these cigarettes." So, you see, that's why you shouldn't judge people out there. Not everybody that does those things really want to do that. Some people they genuinely want to be delivered, but they just don't know how. And I said, &gt;&gt; "The cigarette will take care of it." &gt;&gt; The drinking will take care of itself. The last spirit will take care of itself. But you just come to Jesus. &gt;&gt; I ain't asking you. I am not a legalist. I believe in grace &gt;&gt; and all the father has given me will come to me and let me skip u it says that's it then accept what he gives you he said I do and paragraph now pay attention to this &gt;&gt; paragraph 133 he says and I baptize him in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and him go out here and light up a cigarette So the prophet of the age, &gt;&gt; oh my God, &gt;&gt; I love God. &gt;&gt; I love I love that ability of God that he doesn't look at our sins. But when God is so dedicated to saving you, nothing will stand in its way. You think that, oh, I'm going to keep smoking cigarettes. I promise you, once you come to Jesus, that thing will will go. It might not be instantly that thing will go. And the prophet DIDN'T JUDGE THIS MAN. HE SAID, "DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT THE CIGARETTES. I just want to know, do you want to give your life to God or not? Don't talk to me about THE DRINKING. DO YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR LIFE to God or not? Don't talk Don't talk to me about your last thing. Do you want to be a changed man or woman or not? He baptized him and in front of the prophet a few weeks ago. &gt;&gt; I was down to his home place &gt;&gt; and I saw a vision, &gt;&gt; you know, of an evergreen tree being cut down, turned upside down, and I see failed on it. &gt;&gt; And let me paraphrase it. So the tree fell down and he fell on the on the on the papa. And then and then uh he said the prophet says and papa fell and mashed his back in here. And so the next morning they brought his cigarettes to him when he was in the bed. The next morning they brought his cigarettes to him when he was in the bed. But the desire had done left him. He's never tasted one. Don't even want or nothing else in him. You see &gt;&gt; the desire. It's not you don't have to manufacture that. You come to Jesus &gt;&gt; with no money with no price. Jesus asked is there is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there not enough Holy Ghost for each and every one of us? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is God's spirit. the lack of sincerity. &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit told him &gt;&gt; to and the Bible says there but there must be deep sincerity to know that the God that can take it away already. &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit spoke to me one morning about daylight and said get up on the platform or somewhere and bring these people up there and make them confess everything that &gt;&gt; before you pray for them. &gt;&gt; See the deepness of sincerity. Unless the world repents, it's got to perish. [snorts] And confession is what the world needs today is honest confession. Paragraph 76. &gt;&gt; Many people say they believe That is true. The scripture is correct. I'm reading the prescription. I'm reading what the prescription is. &gt;&gt; And the antidote for my sin. But can I take it? Can I believe it? I might say I believe, but do I believe? We say believe the message of the hour, but why are the blessings of the message of the hour following us? You know, that's the next thing. Just read it and know the direction doesn't cure the disease. The trouble is that we won't take what the remedy says do. &gt;&gt; We don't do what the message says do. Brother says when you do something wrong against someone go repair that. We don't do that. That's the problem. &gt;&gt; Let me skip again 78. You take a person says they are I am a believer. I'm a believer. I believe. But let the gospel light strike them, &gt;&gt; brother. They take it right now and they will show result. You will not see that man in any more pool rooms. You will not see him out here with a cigarette in his hand. &gt;&gt; You won't see him drinking. Are &gt;&gt; is it project? I can't see from far. Can you see? Is it the same thing? &gt;&gt; You can't you won't see him drinking. &gt;&gt; Are we message believers? &gt;&gt; The prophet says many people says go back again to 78. You take a person that says I am a believer. &gt;&gt; I am a message believer. Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; We believe in the message of Malachi 4, &gt;&gt; but let the gospel light strike them. &gt;&gt; You won't see him drinking. &gt;&gt; So if you still drink somehow your your belief is not sincere. &gt;&gt; No, I mean it's the same code. He says lack of sincerity. Now, let's take I've I've hit too much on the brothers uh uh drinking. So, let me go to the next stage. I know maybe sisters, too. &gt;&gt; Maybe. It's as much bad for the brothers as for the sisters. &gt;&gt; Sister, stop drinking. Now, let's go to the next phase. You won't see him flirting with other women. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much they throw their female flesh before him. He will he will turn his heads towards the skies and look towards Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now you are claiming to be a believer. &gt;&gt; But you it's not even that you will turn against but you actually go on your computer and you lust after women's a woman's question. common among especially young boys. &gt;&gt; No one is there's no demons that's going to escape here this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are here to pierce the hearts. &gt;&gt; There are there are young men in this building and maybe even sisters that still watch pornography to this day. You know the thing is I don't know how to explain it. &gt;&gt; No one even told me who that person is or who those people are. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to look at you but I know who you are. You know the prophet said this. That's why you have to listen to the message. The prophet says you know when the demons are about to be exposed. He said, "You can see that on the people's face." &gt;&gt; You can see that on the people's face. &gt;&gt; You can't help it. Those demons, they just get uncomfortable. And I can't see that in your face. You can't see someone is uncomfortable when I mention this, &gt;&gt; but I'm not talking. I'm we're here to make you to set you free &gt;&gt; to help you. Parents as well &gt;&gt; check what your children watch on their phones. You would be surprised even don't think they're too young for you'll be surprised 10 11 year olds they know they know about those stuff &gt;&gt; I had one time this one kid she was talking to me &gt;&gt; about like it was kind of weird like something that one of her sibling was showing her by her description you can tell it was really like some sexual stuff. &gt;&gt; She's probably like what? 9 10 11 I don't know. &gt;&gt; You need to check what your children are. &gt;&gt; The first time I was introduced to pornography, I think seventh grade. So in seventh grade they already know that &gt;&gt; I was just too late to it. My friends already knew about that long time ago. That's a thing that he it really goes with a lot of young men and and sisters. But let me give you an advice to to help you overcome that. &gt;&gt; You know that demon has most effect in you when you you are bored. You have nothing to do. You know I'm I'm not going to be like a saint. I dealt with the same thing too. God delivered me from that. So I'm talking to you from my experience. When you are bored, you have nothing to do. When your mind is getting quiet, then all of a sudden you are hearing the the voice of the devil. &gt;&gt; So get busy. &gt;&gt; Get busy. word. If you are bored, call someone on the phone. Pray, &gt;&gt; read the word. Why? Because when you constant, the Bible says whatsoever is of good virtue of good report. Think on those things. Then why? Because when you think on those things, the Bible says that he will keep him in perfect peace. He that keeps his mind stayed on me. That's for that that's demon. Another demon that's coming to my mind again. I I've had some people telling me that I shouldn't talk about it because I'm not married. But I'm going to talk about it anyway. Husband beating their wives. That's a demon. &gt;&gt; It's a demon. &gt;&gt; Who is that person that want to hurts their sweetheart? &gt;&gt; It's a demon. Husband, when you mistreat your wife, it's a demon. Wife, when you are disobedient to your husband, it's a demon. But one when I'm going to take it in a deeper place where like you don't even think that those have consequences on your children in this church one time. God is my witness. I had one child who came to me innocently. She's probably seven or six. I don't know. She's a kid. What does she know? And she's telling me, "Oh, yesterday &gt;&gt; daddy beat mom and he punched her. He threw her. He threw her off the stairs." And I know who the brother is because I know his child. &gt;&gt; Now imagine your children growing. So you do it do it in secret. But why do you why are you letting your children see that? What are you telling? You have daughters. What are you telling your daughters that it's okay for a man to to put their hands on a woman? &gt;&gt; So then that's why it's getting passed from generation to generation generation. That now it gets to a place where when a when a man beats a wife, she just thinks that that's normal. One time I remember there was ONE SISTER IN THIS CHURCH too who told me that it's normal for a husband to beat their wife because we women sometimes we are ahead. She told me that but that's not the message. I'm sorry if there are any sisters getting beat by the husband. Pray for him. Pray for him. Still be respectful to him. Doesn't mean that if he beat you, you have to be disrespectful. You still be that genuine Christian to him and God is going to work on him. I &gt;&gt; I don't really talk about women beating their husband because I I just hope that's not the case. I really hope we don't have sisters who beat their husband, but it's another thing. They might not physically beat their husband, &gt;&gt; but they can't be leading their house. That's not the order of the Bible. In the Bible, a man is supposed to be the leader of the house. The woman, you are supposed to be submissive to the man. But I'm not going to get deep into that. &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't in my notes. But &gt;&gt; what else? I'm trying to see if there's any other demons that's escaping. gossiping. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's another demon that's killing the church. &gt;&gt; And to be honest, all of us are guilty of it here. But God is not pleased with that. We are not going to walk forward with gospel talking bad about your brother, your sister. If you don't have the courage to go talk to them, pray for them. What's even worse, we don't even just gossip among just as believers, &gt;&gt; but you even take it to the unbelievers outside. &gt;&gt; We got to kill that demon. &gt;&gt; I'll read the last words and we'll just Thank you for being patient with me. The prophet said in a message once more, &gt;&gt; he said, "You had better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you. &gt;&gt; Bring back the oldfashioned prayer meetings, the real godly repentance, repentance. That's what the message of the hour is doing. returning our hearts to godly repentance. &gt;&gt; The all night altar service. I'll stop here. The all night altar service. Restoring the altar service in your homes. Let's not be too busy. parents the same way you you try to make sure you you schedule your day so that oh you know we can do this thing we can go to this place and I can work around this time my wife works around this time we do this you arrange things that way make room for Christ in that arrangement arrange a time where it's it's a family time with God not just everybody alone Dad, you sit with the wife, &gt;&gt; with the children, &gt;&gt; pray together. &gt;&gt; Get your children to get used to praying. &gt;&gt; Cuz I I know I know how kids are. I would never pray if nobody if my dad didn't make us. I would be busy watching my stuff or like playing my games and all the stuff. restoring the altar in the house where the mom used to read Bible stories to her children. &gt;&gt; Most of the Bible stories that I know Ruth Naomi, Esther, Moses, I didn't know about it from the Bible. I learned about that from my mom. I remember I used to love the story of Esther. My mom used to read us all those stories. &gt;&gt; I hope that's what every mother's just doing. Don't leave it up to just your the oldest person in your house. Oh, this person take care of that. No, she didn't ask. She didn't bring those people into life. you. It was your choice to bring them here and it's your responsibility to take care of them. The prophet says that the mother is the sixth gospel. The fifth gospel. My bad. My bad. Fifth. Yeah. Fifth is a six sense. I confused. The fifth gospel. You know what does that mean? You are the gospel to your children. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't even need to be every day. On the weekend, speak one day in the week where the kids know that this is Bible story time. Oh, Pentecost, hear me. Leave. Leave this corruption that Jezebel has worked among you. Leave it. leave it quickly and return back to the word of the Lord. The prophet is begging us, live quickly, &gt;&gt; away from this Hollywood showmanship. &gt;&gt; The message is here to take us away from the Hollywood showmanship. &gt;&gt; We are creators of creatures of heaven. &gt;&gt; Creatures of heaven. I want to be influenced by the fashion of heaven. That's why sisters dress modestly. Brothers dress as brothers. But you know there's one thing I noticed. We have people believers of this message. We dress according to the fashion of the hour. I'm not against being getting well dressed. But my only problem is You are letting Hollywood tell you what is right and what is not. &gt;&gt; Why am I saying this? &gt;&gt; Because I remember there used to be a time, &gt;&gt; you know, it used to be a time that in fashion everybody was wearing teeny tiny pants. I remember even at school like like literally tight like this. I used I got into it at some point even though I shouldn't because I'm too skinny. But at that time that if you were seen with a baggy pants, &gt;&gt; they will make fun of you. &gt;&gt; They would say that oh no like oh my god you dress like an old person. Why? Because Hollywood said the fashion is to have skinny tight pants. And we believers have results. Hollywood says tight pent is good. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But now Hollywood comes back again and now it's fashion to wear baggy pants. And we even see people wearing pants like you would is this a skirt or a pants? No, they you know cuz I back in No, they didn't even used to wear if someone would wear a big pants that would be big but not like a skirt pants. But now Hollywood take took it even further and now people come to church like that. I'm It's not wrong. I'm not against that. But I'm only against you thinking it's right because Hollywood made it right. The prophet says away from that Hollywood showmanship. We are not here to follow Hollywood. We are here to follow the word. Turn with your This is my last quote. Turn with your whole heart back to the word of God. Turn back to the power of the Holy Ghost. You women dress like, &gt;&gt; no tight clothes, dress like sisters, no skirts that when you sit, we have to see your knees. I've said it before, you know. I think these days it has gotten better. Because it used to be like when you see it back in the back there. &gt;&gt; You have to constantly tell your eyes used to look up and see that's that's that's psychologist. That's not right. We don't come to church. We have so many battles out there. We don't come to church to start having battles here again. This is supposed to be a safe place. Don't try don't don't show off your body here at church. This is not a place to show off your body. Dress like a sister &gt;&gt; and men dress like a man even even us even fashion like I remember there used to be a time you wear a pants that's so high up up here. They call it dongi, right? Is that how they call it? Or like I forgot the word. There was a term for it. You know, like they will make fun of you because you wear something small because Hollywood said now that is good. Now that became good for the believer but what the word says good we don't know back to the word you men acts like a man like sons and daughters of God turn oh turn from this Jezebel system that's shocking you and blinding you God help us to have a true repentance you may stand God help us to have a True repentance. That's what we want in this church. [snorts] True repentance, not halfheartedly. You can't do it. I don't want immediate repentance. God wants a a full repentance. How I think today that at this very moment, when my time is up, we should stand to our feet and cry with our hands in the air, &gt;&gt; Lord, once more. Once more, oh Lord, once more. He said, let's stand. everybody that's willing to do it. Now, that's I'm repeating the the prophet's words to you. Everybody that's ready to die, everybody that want to see a revival, do you want to see a revival in your life? The prophecies true revival is to get the trash out of your life. Do you want to You got to give that up. Every die. How many want to die to see the power of God come to Zion and with joy? All his holy mountains nothing hurts sh or shall destroy. He says let's raise our hands. and cry once more, Lord. &gt;&gt; The Jesus that spoke this word is here in this building right now. &gt;&gt; And if you want a move of God in your life, raise your hand and start praying. Say once more, Lord. Once more, Lord. Lord, send the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; with a mighty rushing wind like you did on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Lord, once more. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see you move in my life. Lord, once more. Lord, once more. Looking for a coordination. Oh Lord. You can start singing. Oh [music] my god. I must tell Jesus [music] all of my problem. &gt;&gt; Let me let me read this before we continue. The prophet says in the message of grace, he says, "Let me say this, my senior friend. You may be here this morning a prostitute. You may be here this morning a woman chaser. You may be here a drunkard or a gambler or a murderer. You may be here as an impure husband, an impure wife. You might be the vilest of sinner." and you say, "I am past that stage of redemption." He says, "No, you are not." You wouldn't be at church this morning. You are not past stage of redemption or you wouldn't be here this morning. Grace will make a way for you in this dark hour if you will just accept it. Accept the Lord Jesus Christ and he's yours. Let's keep singing. Am I still Jesus? Oh Lord, I cannot bear [singing and music] my burdens alone. [singing] I must tell [music] Jesus. I must tell Jesus. Jesus can [singing] help me. Jesus alone.

Lord, I trust that the word that was preached, Lord, pierced our hearts. &gt;&gt; Lord, you heard the cry of your children. &gt;&gt; Lord, you heard the confession of your children. Lord, I pray that you be merciful to them. Now, Lord, your prophet told us that if we thoroughly repent that you will forgive us. Lord, you said that though your sins may be red as a crimson, I will make them white as snow. No, we came in here as bad men. We came here as bad women, but Lord, we want to go out as good men, as good women. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I pray that you forgive our trespasses. That you forgive our iniquities, Lord Jesus.

Lord Jesus, Lord, whoever those people are, I pray that you expose them. Whoever those people that don't want to make their life right with you, they don't want to change. I pray father that you expose them, Lord, because we want to move forward. I pray that you also help them Lord Jesus. Maybe just a stony heart. And I pray that you break that stony heart that you give them a heart of flesh. Oh, the Bible tells us that God is a consuming fire.
