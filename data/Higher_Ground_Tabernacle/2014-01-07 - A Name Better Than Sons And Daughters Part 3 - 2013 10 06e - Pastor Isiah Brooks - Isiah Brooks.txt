Hallelujah ah I hope you are amen I am praise God it's like a piece of cake you don't want your slice give it to me I take it brother Keith say no way amen when it's really good it's really hard to share I thank God for his grace and his Mercy if the blood was to lose his power where would we be God oh my mind can't even fathom it because you know I rely on it every day every moment of the day 24/7 amen surely we thank God for the blood of Jesus that will never lose his power I uh was thinking you know because I know that there are those who don't believe in taking communion and you know and I wonder sometimes Lord they better be right if they're not right they've lost it because Jesus says if you don't take that you can have no part of me and you know what if you're going to do away with the uh communion you might as well stop baptizing hello you know and uh with water right because uh you know water doesn't bring you to Regeneration but God ordered it that we must do it I mean you take for example the tree of life you know a knowledge of Good and Evil they could have lived forever they had a choice and they chose the tree of life and look where we are now see it's so simple you think about it and and Jesus talk about it and you think to yourself oh Lord one thing for certain if you don't have to take communion and you're taking communion you still ain't wrong you see what I'm but the point is if you're supposed to take it and you're not taking it then you're in trouble if you're taking it and you don't have to that means you got some extra if you're not taking it and you're supposed to that means you're zero oh God help our souls uh you know I I don't know I just know one thing and I know one thing only the word that I have in me says Amen to the word amen God ain't going to write something about what we supposed to do and not amen it that's right hey I feel like shouting already Luke 12:32 you love the Lord oh help me help me please Lord get me through this by the grace of God you know I want to say by the uh the Lord uh you know when it's hard to ET eat Eternal bread in time you know you know because it's last forever it's it's just it's hard to eat hey it's true when they thought they were running out of here it comes again oh they had they ate till they couldn't eat no more and then they still had baskets over surely God is so good to us St Luke 12 I don't you know what my I feel so good when I'm in church and around God's people I I really do I get I get especially when the atmosphere is right I I get beside myself I feel really like a little kid I really do so sometime you see me cut up and I don't mean to but I can't just see I can't help it amen St Luke 12 and 32 fear not little flock but it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and we're going to tie that in today I was reading a quote and brother brandham say that this was the day or the hour of the little flock and when I read that it just really encouraged my soul and we're going to uh come through some other scriptures but let's just start with that by the grace of God Amen Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord is humbl we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love Lord you've been so good to us you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves we pray father that you would bless us what you have we just pray that you would give us Grace to receive your blessing we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated in the message proving his word which was in 1964 brother bam says God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was the beginning of the creation his body was re was the redeemed creation and now Through the Ages the church lost its first love and I started that quote and didn't finish it and now in the last days you promise to call a little minority the little flock at the last days father our hearts are jumping and my heart's pounding when I think of that and know that your words are true and none of them can fail let these people today understand that and let the sinner seek you at this hour before the gates close and there be no more time let the Bride As she starts getting out of Step from this and that may she come back into the step as the vision showed a few weeks ago I pray thee father to bless now and heal the sick here are clothes laying here and handkerchiefs coming from different parts and now in the scripture says it was taken clothes and aprons handkerchiefs from the body of Paul and they went to the sick and God healed them now we know that we're not St Paul but we know that it wasn't St Paul it was the people's faith in him being your servant Lord these people wouldn't D driven these hundreds of miles if they didn't believe so he said it wasn't St Paul but it was uh the faith that the people had in him it's true I mean it's like any pastor it can't help you if you don't have faith and trust in it right it's it's just of no value amen and that's why so many people are not healing delivered because they don't have that Faith now we look at this thing and we want you to understand by the grace of God that you and I have been in a we in a h a strange situation and and let me let me we we we're considered the bride okay we're considered as the female part Now understand because of what Eve did she had no life in her right brother Bram says she became the tree of death and the Man became the tree of life because the woman has no life there is nothing in her to produce a seed except the man plants the life so is the bride amen we we have nothing in us to produce Christ except Christ plants the seed and before he does we're just dead we can just be a incubator that's all we are you know you can say well you know uh uh uh uh and you know the pr of God puts goes on to say and to think you think he said listen he said the only thing that's connected to the mother is the naval cord right because this the literal light comes from the father right you can say oh they got so many chromosomes and so but it takes his blood that's right Amen to make it come to life hello amen and so is it with the bride of Jesus it takes his blood amen he said listen let me and I'm reading from question and answers he said for the woman doesn't bear Life in Her M he said it took a woman to bring death the birth of a woman or from a woman brings death the birth from a man brings life oh come on somebody listen he said through our birth through the birth of a woman we we we we we all die cuz we've subject to death is that right right and he said through the birth of a woman through the birth uh uh uh brings death it's we're subject to death amen but he says through the birth of a man we have or we we forever we have life forever see so the woman is the tree of death hello now you might not like that it it's true anyhow now I'm bringing this by the grace of God so that you can understand you don't have no power ain't nothing in you if God don't put life in you you got nothing you're just dead and that's why all the churches died because they put the tree of life out in Leia he knocking at the door trying to bring life and they put him out so all they got is a shell they is dead dead and here we are little flock amen only because God prophesied Amen you that's right you are the thoughts of God manifestors for this day oh now I don't know about you I don't care if you just fult before you came in here if God is telling you something that's contrary to your thoughts take his thoughts over yours oh who can be who who who in Us in here can say I am I'm I'm this I'm that I'm this I you can't say nothing without the I am in you huh he said I am U Mali 3:6 I love this I am a God that changed now I can rest on that these glasses got in my way this I can rest on that I don't need but two witnesses now huh amen listen he says I am amen uh uh the the Lord and I change not in Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ says uh uh the word of God says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in other words he doesn't change what he decided to do in the beginning has to be the results of the endall there's no changing his mind amen you ought some somebody somebody ought to be shouting right now why because you realize God can't change his mind about you at all if he did it would make him imperfect amen he doesn't have a second choice that's right I love this because he says listen he talks about I am the bread of life he tells the people if you eat of me you shall not die if you drink of me you shall not die hello amen my because wherever life is I don't care God said in his word if you don't cry out I can make the rocks cry out that's what kind of life he is he can step into a rock and make a rock talk that's God he is life and wherever he is come on somebody the bush didn't have lips but the bush talks cuz he is life you mean to tell me that God has a harder time stepping inside of you no God there is no hard times for God God commands and it moves he speaks and it does what he says it doesn't come back void God doesn't say oops I made a mistake it is he is and when he say something it is just as though he's declared it because it has to come to pass we often sometime Wonder Lord how long it's going to take for us to reach that Perfection as long as God has already determined in his mind for you hello it's not him that willth nor he that runneth come on somebody it's God's timing it's God who he says I wait now what you going to do with this he says I wait for the precious fruit and God don't get him patience he know when per fruits are perfected he says I'm waiting on this this is what I've been waiting on for thousands of years I've waited for you to be perfected and know so he's he does he's not going to get impatient at the last moment see this age doesn't has it has no bearing on God he's not affected by this oh I love this because in the midst of all this demonic power and demonic Force God is being defiant he's proving that nothing Satan can produce can hinder his own his moveen is that right he proved that when he went down to Hell hell was the darkest and the most wicked place there was Hol come on somebody but he whooped the devil he he whooped Darkness he whooped everything that was down there so what if hell blending into Earth is already conquered amen conquered by whom Christ himself the very life of God now I'm telling you something because I'm going to get to a real important scripture here in just a moment now remember I read to you the last time he said he if you hunger for God shouting will take place if you got so hungry for God speaking in tongues will take place amen hello if you got so hungry for God excuse me you'll just keep on hungering oh come on I'm G read that again he said if you got that if you just get so hungry for God shouting will take place if you got so hungry for God Speak and tongues will take place if you got so hungry for God you just keep on hungering Amen keep yourself he says now don't you go seeing yourself getting indifferent just remember look out there's another Spirit trying to work itself in there amen stay right before God humble with travail of Soul yes amen he didn't say travail of Flesh he said travail of of Soul it means it goes deep amen right it goes deep he said just be all that good old that he said I can prove by the Bible that the first time the angel of God went over the land to seal with the Holy Ghost he only sealed those who s cried and SED for the abomination in the city and you know what brother I've got a quote right here he said in N he said during the time of the world uh World War I at the 11th Hour was the hour the whole the angel says stop my servants haven't been hey my servants haven't been seal hold it up you can't end this thing cuz brother Brooks ain't got it yet Hallelujah glory to God Amen don't look at me like I'm crazy cuz I am Hallelujah you look at this thing and he stopped he stopped I was still somewhere in my daddy's Lo hey and God knew that he saw that and he held up time for you and I so if he held up time in the destruction of the world for you don't you know he's going to get it amen woo that seal is yours amen but I said to myself I said what's wrong with people you see this this cap is a seal what good if the seal would be if there was nothing in it a seal going to seal something up amen right people oh I got this Holy Ghost I got the sealing all come on somebody it's more to the Holy Ghost than Faith amen faith is just down here this body got to be filled all the way up same Holy Ghost same virtues but God can't seal it to the Bott is full Hallelujah to all the character of God is in you yeah it is the seal the Bible said it is the spirit of adoption amen it is the spirit that's going to bring you up the ladder amen if you let him yes amen amen if you let him but you got to be tested Galatians says you got to be toed by whom the Holy Ghost yes you're a child of God you've been born you confessed him the life is in you but you got to grow up that's what the Bible said up into him amen amen God can wait on you he patiently Waits wow he's got something in mind for you hello Joseph would not have been the kind of man because when God when Joseph went into Egypt Joseph was basically spoiled are his daddy spoiled him he was a a daddy's boy he got in and everything he wanted to he ain't never got into much trouble other than his brothers ridicule him but when he got down into Egypt the trials came cuz God wanted to adopt him amen amen hello somebody amen y'all think having your brothers and sisters amen against you is bad that ain't nothing is wait to when God put you down in an Egyptian position and then CA the Egyptians to put you through the trials amen y'all hear what I'm saying that's when you're going to be adopted cuz now they see what you got and even though you think things ought to go right remember Joseph said don't for forg get me when you get up there in the in the place and and the man said oh I ain't going to forget you he got up there and forgot Joseph but God didn't forget Hallelujah God remembered why he had Joseph there Hallelujah and when Joseph passed the test this is what I love about it because even though he was under those servant circumstances amen whatever he did still prospered amen he kept is integrity and that's what God wants for us in these trials and situations keep your integrity because that's where God blesses you amen they couldn't put a thing on Joseph life they knew who go Joseph worshiped y'all hear me they knew who Joseph worshiped ain't God good to us think about it he says now he talks about it he says Len listen he said that was the hour that the angel the of Ezekiel was going through the land when they he said he said and you know he talks about Israel he said they didn't realize it he said but Ezekiel was prophesying to them amen that when Titus was come through he wanted to see who would signs and crying and remember all the Holy Ghost filled people got out of the city right amen and the slaughtering Angel slew everything that was in the walls from the babies all the way come on somebody that's what the slaughtering Angel did Brother bar said only those who heard the message of Jesus escape the slaughtering of Titus Hallelujah and only those who hear the message of William brandom come on oh y'all didn't want to say it amen y'all slow on that they're the only ones that's going to escape the slaughter that this world is getting ready to get hey woo Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah only because he chose us hallelujah he chose you he chose me he chose us hallelujah now we hear all these things and all these things are good amen I've got quotes for these if you want to if you want to uh want to find them you know but I just I want I'm kind of paraphrasing these things but if you listen to the message uh the 10 versions you'll hear brother talks about the 11th Hour workers and how that was us amen and he said it was right around the same time 1906 1914 amen when the Holy Ghost start being poured out now come on somebody I did a little calculation I brought it from I took it from there and took it up to 1946 when the angel came right brother said at the same time the angel went to Israel was the same time the angel came to him now I know what history say in 1948 brother in 1946 am hello somebody that God began to call Israel back into her Homeland to be a nation hello somebody amen what he said he said the tender hand of Jehovah drove them back ah my God my God my God so the tender hand of Jehovah is going to drive the bride to desperation if she ain't careful hello and you got to see what the tender hand did to to Israel to understand what the tender hand going to do to this little right amen see that's that's as a as a bride you know uh like Israel Marty them Marty them Mar them no but I want you to understand we're going to suffer brother brandham never said how much we won't experience the Great Tribulation but he didn't say we weren't going to experience tribulation right cuz we expen tribulation on a daily basis that's right amen but I'm telling you it's getting more intense especially for the bride where brother Brooks where in your mind W come on somebody if you ain't experiencing a real battle in here you dead that devil gets hold of your mind y'all know what I'm talking about am I the only one I mean you fighting every day you wake up you jump out of the bed he right there you fall on your knees he's right there yes sir I tell you what God is giving me Grace though brother I tell you what I tear him up in my dreams he tried to he tried to get me in my dreams and stupid stuff and I tell you what the word of the Lord make himself real Hallelujah I know I can't do it on my own but the word of the Lord come if he don't wake me up he make me whoop him Hallelujah I'm so grateful for the Holy Ghost amen sometime it seem like I do better while I'm sleeping brother amen but I so thank God for his grace woo oh Lord have mercy now we look at this thing and we say oh if that be the case where are we that's the point I'm trying to make the 11th Hours come the 11th Hour worker you know it's a shorter time than any other time right all right the seals are being open now what happens is the the the seventh Church age even though it overlaps God is done with it yeah she's been brought to trial but there was another secret age there was an age that came forth that the world know nothing about and and you you say well an eighth Angel well the eighth Angel is Joshua Jesus Christ himself right is God himself there was a bride age that nobody knew that was hidden under the seals but it the revelation of the seven Church ages when the eight brother said the seven Church age was completely black and out there was no righteousness there there was nothing amen nothing and then God comes along through a prophet and draws a little sliver and we call that the bride age hello that's that little flock amen that God called oh Jesus he called out see we you know we think you you think you excited about this message you wait till your time come to cross over amen hallelujah it doesn't matter if you translated or you die when you recognize you believe the truth and that truth is standing for you right there at the river of Jordan amen hallelujah I don't know in this what they do when they cross over how people contain them I don't know how they contain them folks come on somebody you know I don't know we proba the wild this Bunch up there what age you come out of they they know now I know I'm I'm I hope Brother Rich don't mind me saying this but I'm going to tell you something at the time that s the cat the pass I saw her I don't know how I did but I saw her slanging her hair I saw her screaming I saw her holling I saw her thinking Jesus Christ now I don't know how come I mean here it was I was seeing this thing and the phone hadn't even rang yet hello when that phone rang I knew who it was and I knew what they were telling me even though I didn't want to listen cuz I had all already been visited by God and he done already told me what to preach he didn't have to show me that that ain't the first time when brother Titus amen passed on Amen I saw him as well I can't explain it all I know it's what I see Hallelujah ain't God good to us come on somebody it ain't what your eyes see is what his eyes see is what his eyes declare Hallelujah come on somebody and let me tell you something there ain't nobody in here I wouldn't want to see be bride hey somebody come on I don't know how God does it but he knows how to do it in a twinkling he knows how to do it oh my God you know what it's the last moments of the oven that makes the cake amen it's what the oven does at the last moment if you take that cake out of the oven before it's time you've got a mess I don't care how long it's been in the oven some of y'all don't know what bacon but I do but you let that thing stay there just at the right time when that Bell say thing you there Hallelujah and that's the way it is with God God knows how to let us listen this is what I've heard somebody say and I I haven't found it anywhere brother B say they said to me they said you know brother brandham told them that when a man die without any cause you know God was pleased with it but when a man God allows a person to go through something all he's doing is getting that person ready to cross over he's using that time to get that individual right oh Jesus talk about a god rich in Mercy brother R said God you owe me an answer you owe me some you owe me an explanation how come that girl die like that God ain't ow him nothing God don't owe none of us nothing explanation God don't owe none of us anything amen huh and God comes right over here and then what happens Amen brother the Lord finally lifts the band off of brother brandham and say she should have died what 10 years ago five years ago when she was drowning but she wasn't ready Hallelujah I can't have much confidence in a god like that that's not going to take me until I'm ready somebody ought to feel feel good in here he said I've never lost one I ain't going to lose one woo my my my my ain't God good listen the mark of the beast he says oh what the matters with this world anyhow what's wrong oh wake you people and turn to God what's the matter with you can't you see the great shaking of God his angel coming down moving doing the same signs and wonders just exactly what he said he would do and nightly right before you well say listen I'm going to tell you how blessed you are because listen you and I could have been born in the day of William Brandon but he he wanted a bride in this age who was totally joined to him didn't have no in between come on somebody and he goes on and said blessed is the man who have not seen but yes believe hey hey come on somebody he com along and gives you a double blessing for believing this even though you've not seen it somebody I tell you what I'm feeling pretty good right now oh my God think about it people think about what I'm saying think about what he's telling us here this Angel did not go down in Sodom it did not go with oh I was thinking to day I said oh this morning and yesterday I said oh my God I can't hardly wait till to see the queen of Shiva I said she may not have been much to nobody else but the Bible said her righteousness was so great she going to stand Amen in this day in the day of judgment and testify against this nation and all the other nations hello come on somebody some some oh I can't even say it the way I want to but it gave me so much joy to realize that God took somebody who didn't even have a name in Israel that's right amen brought her all the way up Hallelujah and said listen this queen with stand in the judgment and condemn amen W Hallelujah wo I can't tell you what it's doing for me this old body can't move like it used to I tell you what hallu one of these days I won't have no hindrances oh you think about it here it is amen he says now listen this is what I love this is why everybody moving away from William brandom moving away from William brandom you know but they don't understand it wasn't will in pray it was the angel that was behind that skin God cloaked himself as a Secret Agent Man Came Down Hallelujah spying out the land and they couldn't even see him woo but blessed is the eyes of the man who can see huh blessed is a man who could understand hallelujah what was going on Hallelujah that's right or Roberts and Billy Graham still living and got us still got names hallelujah amen you don't even hear William brandom except for among those who believe hello hello hello hello but listen what the word of God said the Bible says amen uh the word of God here a quote here says the in the mark of the beast he said listen this Angel did not go down to in Sodom it did not go with the rest of the modern Billy Graham and them they went down there and tried to call them out but the angel stayed with the elected child so I want you to understand William brandham is gone the angel is still here sir Hallelujah the angel is still here why because it wasn't the Earthly angel that we fell in love with it was the mighty Angel Hallelujah of Revelation [Music] 10 that angel got to stay because that angel oh this is what this is this might be my little pet thing but me and brother are uh uh uh uh Fields Samuel was talking about this I said he said brother Brooks what do you think about this he said something thought thought came across my mind he said what about that Rapture he said you think that people have began to turn young before the changing of the body before the before the glorified body because you know you got a glorify but he said remember he said brother bam and I said you know brother I preached that to my church I said they look at me like I'm crazy I said but brother brandham kept saying here and there oh oh Sarah your your hair your gray hair is turning come come on somebody and I said why is it that God has placed in our mouth we're getting younger True Believers are saying that we're getting younger and people are now walking up to us and say oh you're looking younger am 41 hle God doing something amen when I went to tr they said brother brce we almost didn't even know who you are you look so young now it don't look like that to me quite in the mirror but you don't know what God showing other people huh my point

about you got to say exactly what the prophet said you got to that's true understand what I'm saying but let me tell you where the power of it is in the seed yes sir because if you can't read or right what if you can't even hear what if you blind yall understand what I'm saying how you going to say and do what he say except the seed be in you amen that's right it is the seed that brings the life you can read you can quote all day be a parakeet he said being a paracet don't make you nothing but a bird brain anyway it's got to be a revelation it's got to be something amen that's revealed in you and people going off on these tangents and making putting people back in bondage Lord that's right y'all hear what I'm saying putting the people in bondage because now they fearing if I miss one word what are you talking about he is the word he said I write it on the tables of your heart not in your head it's in your heart amen if it's ain't in your heart I don't care how much your head can quote it amen it ain't doing you no good am I right or wrong y'all hear what I'm saying come on there are things I've never heard before but I'm going tell you something when somebody preach something that ain't quite right it's a check there amen when brother bandam didn't know nothing about the serpent SE the God spoke it through his mouth the serpent he didn't know but the one that was in him knew that's right that one that's in you know more about the word amen than it's written on here amen you said well what do you mean brother Brooks let me tell y'all something just like I told that brother not long ago I said listen if I had listen to the commentaries commentary is what men put there right and they said amen in Genesis well MDC was a earth priest now if I believe that that's what I would be preaching but a prophet came and told us no MDC was God amen amen now who's right amen the prophet or the commentary y'all hear what I'm saying oh come on somebody just like I told a brother I said you talking about the Greek and the Hebrew don't you know them words been changed you can go back to a real a real English Bible way back and they got words you have to look up in the dictionary cuz you and I wouldn't have no idea what those words meant in English y'all hear what I'm saying that's why it cannot come by intellect it got to come by Revelation amen who would have known and I don't know why I'm on this RM but who would have known Abraham and Sarah turned back Young the Bible never said it directly amen but the man who wrote it was able to come and show us amen what was in the book and told us a story that why God turned him back young he just didn't turn him young said he but he gave he gave he gave uh uh uh uh Sarah new milk glands gave her a new womb and reproduction system come on somebody gave her a new everything hello and so God comes right around and he's telling us listen I ain't just changing you cuz if I just changeed you back young you still wouldn't fit in heaven that's right amen you still defected you you you you you you can't make it I got to change everything about you your whole makeup must be changed oh Lord that's the truth amen the whole world going to be changed you know that yes sir and when that fire baptism come it's going to burn everything out of it that ain't supposed to be now I don't even know how after that is going to Blossom and the seed's going to survive but the word of God tells us how this thing will become a paradise I don't understand this did you know God can take the life of a dog and put it in a rock and make the rock bark amen that's the truth God can do that cuz it ain't the rock that's live it's the life that's in the Rock That's What Makes You Different see what I'm saying you're an animal am right but you become God when God puts his life in you so God makes an animal God yeah however you want to analyze it that's where it is he lows himself down to our and puts himself in a piece of dust and lives even scientists know there's a God Particle I love that I love that saying God Particle every time I think about it I think about me yeah I am floating around here and they don't even know it amen it's true can I go along can I move on Ezekiel 43 and2 it says behold the glory of the Lord God of Israel came from the way of the East and his voice was like the noise of many Waters and the Earth shine with his glory I said Ezekiel was in our day Ezekiel Saw the voice of many Waters come on somebody he saw the Bride of Jesus Christ hello amen and it said and according to the appearance of the vision which I saw even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city and the Visions were like the visions that I saw by the river chear and I fell upon my face Now understand Ezekiel is talking talking about amen he says and when I came to destroy the city now I want you to understand something took place when God told brother Brandon to throw those rocks up in the air and he threw those rocks up in the air and a whirlwind came something took place and he then said judgment has now struck the west coast and he said see which way it went it went straight out and is headed back East that's what he said now where is most of the destruction happening now in the East see but he coming back this way how comes it's coming back this way amen and you and I must understand we must be ready and prepared like there was a death angel for Le deia there's a death angel for this age amen yes sir it's coming and the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the Gat whose Prospect is toward the East so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the Lord fill the house this is what he said and I heard him speaking unto me out of of the house and the man stood by me W amen the man stood by me so you got to understand amen what was he saying I heard the voice from the house but he was the man amen amen in other words God was showing in tyght the house represents the man and the voice is coming out of a man amen oh come on some some this is good stuff to me right amen but he goes on and talks about the place of the throne and the place of the soul of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the children of of Israel and my Holy Name shall the house of Israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by the EM nor by the caucuses of their kings in their high places in other words God said I'm going to fix it so no man can defile it ever again right okay now here's the scripture amen was shared by the our brother Keith which is a real blessing Deuteronomy 4:9 and I I'm GNA close on this in just a moment I don't mind you sharing scriptures anybody whoever and if the Lord prompt me I'll use it if he doesn't I won't but this one was really good and and I've been really it's been it was a a real blessing in to me uh uh because of some of the trials that came my way after this scripture was shared and it's Deuteronomy 4 and N only take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy son's Sons he said keep them diligently lest they depart come on y'all now I can tell you right now you say it's not so easy for it's so easy to forget you can you can walk from here to there and forget amen if you don't keep it diligently you will forget it that's why he told Israel remember this remember remember remember remember always remember he said meditate on it amen because when you meditate you start pulling things up yes sir amen all right is that good or not now I'm going to come to something here Leviticus please turn with me to Leviticus 23 you love the Lord hallelujah I love the Lord now I'm looking at this thing and I'm saying God because I want you to understand I had to surrender something to God and I surrendered everything my will my ways my thoughts my efforts CU I was constantly getting in his way remember I said the other day I said you know if you call yourself on a fast and you get all hungry and mean that's your fast that ain't something Lord call right that's that's your fast because you God telling you know not supposed to fast and your face all disfigured and you're looking all like that ain't you know you supposed to look happy and you know when God calls you to fast you don't hunger until it's time to eat and come on then the devil attacks you cuz he doesn't told you you need to fast three four days and you only got a a day and a half in but you got hungry and the devil say see you fail God no you didn't you thought it was four days and God said it was one and a half so now the devil is there to convict you and condemn you for not doing something that God never told you to do you want to impress who God wherever he leads me I'll follow y'all look at I've been there folks I've been there I've seen the devil condemn me amen because I didn't finish the fast I thought when God stopped leading you how you going to go any further right amen right it becomes difficult no don't get me wrong if if you ought to push through that he'll lead you to push through that right but you won't fail you said well wait minut if God can lead a man 40 days without failure he can lead you two days or three if he's leading you hello somebody then he make you feel like oh you're not GNA get what you desire because you didn't you fail God when did God depend on your doing to bless you see he twists it all up you bless even you never fast you're a son you're a daughter oh God he never said you had to fast to be saved that's right amen or to get anything faith move mountains not fasting Faith there's nothing wrong with fasting don't get me wrong but that's not what God requires Faith it's that what pleased God I love that who that brother preached that message on uh yeah brother uh John the economy you know faith is the key faith is the monetary system I love that that's right with faith you can get anything from God Leviticus 238 I don't even have my watch with me sorry about that 238 but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord Seven Days In the seven day is a holy conversation convocation ye shall do no Serv our work therein that Serv our work means no servant work no slave work or no service to God yeah so anyway on the seventh day and we you see that's what people don't understand God requiring you to die die amen you can kick a dead man he ain't going to grunt not one time dead you must die fully rest that's right Leviticus 23:36 seven days you shall offer an offering made by what fire unto the Lord and on the eighth day which is us shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by th unto the Lord huh no dead Services if you in the Eighth Day the eighth age you're supposed to offer fire where is the Fire come on somebody it's a solemn assembly and you shall do no Ser work therein but you're supposed to offer back to God fire amen eth day is that right brother say when the seals were open huh when God B the seals and the seals were open amen he said it took us back to the first day which would be the eighth day he said there's no such day as a eighth day other than it's the first day and all them people tell they in the service in the in in the Eighth Day and cold like ice no bring the fire amen also on the temp I love this Leviticus 23:27 on the 10th day of this seventh month Revelation 10:7 there shall be a day of atonement it shall be a holy convocation unto you and ye shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord how you flick your soul how do you do that huh h how do you get to a place to first of all amen you you you do what it says my soul says yes to your will yes to your way how do you afflict your soul by denying your flesh you can call it fasting you can call whatever it is but you deny your flesh when you afflict your soul and offer an offering made by fire you know what that means folks fire there something about fire that's exciting I don't care if you looking for looking at it from a distance is just something that me mesmerizes us something that fascinates us you know something about fire really wants to pull you in but you get so close your flesh is not so but it does I don't know whether y'all know what I'm talking about but there's something about fire you just wish you could walk in it oh y'all don't know what I'm talking about but anyway I've had that experience of looking at a fire and wanting to just move but you know your flesh know that you'll be burned without faith but with faith you can walk straight through a fire and never receive one burn amen and you don't even have to be a Christian to do that Muslims do it all the time walk on coals of fire never burnt takes a sword amen and raming through them and comes out on the other side it ain't no fake sword is real no blood no whatsoever why faith can move those things Faith Taps into another dimension and work through it see what I'm saying and am I'm I'm almost done so we look at this thing and we say okay now how how do we come to a place where we don't work when you can come to a place and contact God on a daily basis and say Lord live through me it's not I that live but Christ that lives through me right Lord I deny myself today I want you to tell me what to do you be my Lord yes sir all right you be my Lord I want to do just what you say do if you don't want me to move out of the house I'll stay right there see I don't want my mind my thoughts my nothing I want whatever you want me to do am you think God want to do that yes he will God told that one woman he said I'm going to send you Elijah but you go out there and wait by the fence and she waited for hours Faith said he was going to come she re it was revealed to her he's coming and she got out there early enough so she wouldn't miss him not that he might not come I'm going to be here when he comes I'll see him coming see that's what faith does oh not that God ain't gonna meet I'm going to be there and when it comes I'll be right there when it comes amen all right remember I forgot what story that was brother B said that that uh the he had to go around the corner for something and this lady God told her to go stand on the corner brother bradam going to come this way see so I wasn't just working for the prophet it was working for the woman too yes sir right it'll work for you God will tell you to do something you just go do it you don't have to he don't have to explain it amen I just believe that if God told you amen that listen you are you asked for this new car let's just use that for an example sound Conor but maybe you can understand if God say listen you go stand on the corner of Hickman and and and 86 and I'm going to send somebody by with a new car they just going to hand you the keys and the title I guarantee you if you really believe that you stand there from sun up to sun down if it's revealed to you you know God said it you'll stand right there and guess what you think the devil gonna make it easy for you that'll probably be the day of the rain you think he going to make it easy for you Amen to be a day amen Hil come from somewhere it's not going to make it easy for you but your point is you got to wait and stay there till Jesus come and so I'm going to close on this there's only one Covenant for this day in for us to live and that's the abrahamic Covenant and that Covenant was given to us by way of ham or God himself right y'all know ham means god that's the part I'm working with so he comes along and he gives out unconditional Covenant and according to Hebrews the Bible say he could swear by no greater he made a oath to himself I'll do it for you now I don't know whether y'all believe it I do I'm just dumb enough to do it Hallelujah there's only one bread and one body and the world don't have it when God came down here he came us came and gave us Mana bread that was hidden from ages for ages behind the veil and put it on tapes and books and said eat if you eat this you'll live don't you see what I'm saying see what God did they can't live cuz they're not living off the bloody ble word of God they can't they living from Mana of a manner of a old day and the Bible said it rocked it died the life left it it was only the Mana that was behind the veil where the life never left it that's why the prophet could be gone for so many years and the life still lives it still lives because that's Mana from behind the veil one blood one life one Holy Ghost there ain't no second or third Holy Ghost ain't no different what the Holy Ghost did yesterday he has to do it today cuz devil he never changes there's only one Lord one father was all right one baptism amen come on somebody you know it's just like little brother Caleb I could ask him did you get baptized today yeah how do you know how do you know you got baptized today it was an experience for him he can tell me where he can tell me who baptized him he can tell me how what was said it was an experience how can you be baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire without an experience you got to know something amen something have to take place oh come on have some you you favored Miss bu you favored you you married he done already said he Delight in you don't don't feel bad the words that that are being spoken is to encourage you is to is to build you up let's put it this way a dead man can't hear did you hear anything today Hallelujah if you heard something that means you're not dead huh come on somebody somebody you love the Lord amen I know I've been a little winded but I tell you what I sure enjoy I'm still enjoying myself amen because I realized that this message is so it's unconditional and I couldn't have made it any better it it's getting better all the time and the trials are getting harder but it's making the word even sweeter it seemed to be magnifying Grace to me you know what I mean my trials seem to magnify thisg Grace mad with you all these opportunities and chances God gave you and he only had one I don't even feel sorry for it you know it's amazing and that's how it is you see why what are you talking about listen Judas he was he wasn't of God and guess what he only had to mess up one time huh Saul messed up one time now he was you know I'm working with you know how he's he's he's not uh bride he comes up in the foolish virgin catgory but look how many times you messed up now I know I'm not the only one and you still experiencing the joy of the Lord and you still experiencing the presence of God you can you can feel him you can you you you know he's with you and and he's still speaking sweet stuff to you don't get God wrong he can bring the ax he knows how to bring the axe if God wanted to bring the AE in here I'll let him bring the AE y'all understand what I'm saying I'm going let him do what he want to do to me if he want to become John the Baptist just for the moment he can do that amen God ain't shy y'all understand what I'm saying and we fail to see you know that God is bringing all of this sweet love trying to woo us he can do something different you know there's other ways he can get your attention so take advantage of his grace amen thank you Lord you love God oh I do I do I do amen we can stand we getting ready to change the order of service into our communion let me say it like this people of God not one of us within our own power cu to actually fulfill all the word it takes the almighty God thank God for his grace and he's going to give us that opportunity to fulfill all of it cuz we couldn't do it on our own he had to come himself and do it for us now I don't know whether you really understand that but I put it this way it ought to give you joy unspeakable
