[54:18] you're drawing closer to him you got the
[54:22] world shut out
[54:24] just you and he are together
[54:29] disappearing of angels frighten the
[54:31] little
[54:33] virgins
[54:35] speaking of marriage she had been taught
[54:38] that the days of Miracles was passed and
[55:38] and with the stripes I was here foreign
[56:40] on favor with God could you have your

[56:46] thou has found favor with God
[56:49] and while she was thinking on that
[56:52] scripture
[56:54] then that was the scripture that was
[56:57] confirmed to her
[56:59] now if you're sick I don't see exactly
[57:02] speak on that scripture if you're lost
[57:05] she was that big on that scripture if
[57:08] you want the Holy Spirit think on that
[57:11] scripture and the Holy Ghost will come
[57:13] from
[57:18] amen amen now as we stand I know
[57:24] we appreciate the word of God
[57:28] you know if I would have said that
[57:30] somebody else was
[57:34] was the author of that quote
[57:38] there would be some who would readily
[57:41] receive it yeah
[57:44] but because I said it was from Brother
[57:47] randomly
[57:49] some people struggle
[58:08] God is good to us we're going to be
[58:11] coming from the scripture of Jeremiah
[58:15] the 31st chapter
[58:20] we'll read the third and fourth first
[58:22] Jeremiah 31 3-4
[58:34] um
[58:36] and then we'll read John 17 22-24.
[58:47] Jeremiah Jeremy remember in that quote I
[58:52] have found favor of the Lord
[58:55] favored of the Lord
[58:58] you are favorite of the Lord
[59:04] the Lord have appeared of old unto me
[59:07] saying
[59:08] yea I have loved thee with the
[59:11] Everlasting Love
[59:12] do you want to understand
[59:19] therefore with loving kindness have I
[59:22] drawn thee
[59:24] is
[59:29] again I will build thee and thou shalt
[59:33] be built o Virgin of Israel Israel
[59:41] Thou shalt again be adorned with thy
[59:44] tablets and Shout go forth in the dances
[59:48] of them that make Mary the new Lord
[59:54] amen amen Saint John 17.
[1:00:06] Andrew
[1:00:14] 22-24
[1:00:18] foreign
[1:00:25] and the glory which thou gaveth me
[1:00:28] I have given them that they may be one
[1:00:31] even as we are one
[1:00:35] I think is
[1:00:39] them endowing me that they may be made
[1:00:43] perfect in one
[1:00:45] and that the world may know that thou
[1:00:47] has sent me and has loved them as thou
[1:00:51] has loved me
[1:01:00] father I will that they also whom thou
[1:01:03] has given me be with me where I am
[1:01:13] that they may behold my glory which thou
[1:01:17] has given me for thou loveth me before
[1:01:20] the foundation of the world I thank you
[1:01:23] foreign
[1:01:31] foreign
[1:01:36] father God we thank you for your grace
[1:01:40] thank you for your mercy we thank you
[1:01:44] for your Divine love that word you
[1:01:47] cannot even express
[1:01:51] our gratitude how you could love such a
[1:01:55] such a such a one is
[1:02:00] your love is past my understanding
[1:02:06] and we believe
[1:02:08] do we believe Lord that the work you've
[1:02:11] begun in US
[1:02:14] father bless this audience
[1:02:19] let them not leave out
[1:02:21] in the way they came in
[1:02:24] may we be drawn closer to you
[1:02:27] may we be willing
[1:02:30] Lords to give you praise
[1:02:39] that's why
[1:02:48] I thought I'll Minister on the meaning
[1:02:52] of Calvary the
[1:02:58] significance
[1:03:02] this is just the beginning
[1:03:05] of a little series that I will be doing
[1:03:11] because I believe that a person
[1:03:14] don't have a meaning or understanding of
[1:03:17] Calvary
[1:03:19] they have not yet been to California
[1:03:23] and every Christian is
[1:03:27] should have the experience
[1:03:30] of what I call Calvary this is
[1:03:35] if you don't have an idea
[1:03:39] of what it costs Christ Jesus
[1:03:44] to die for your sins
[1:03:47] and if you don't know
[1:03:50] that it was once and for all because
[1:03:55] uh if you don't understand
[1:04:00] that once you become a true Christian
[1:04:02] okay
[1:04:04] there is no one that can unchristen you
[1:04:07] not personally
[1:04:10] and understand this by God's grace
[1:04:15] that everything has a meaning because
[1:04:18] Shack shows
[1:04:19] Jesus Christ didn't go to Calvary for
[1:04:22] nothing
[1:04:24] there was a purpose
[1:04:27] there was a meaning there was a reason
[1:04:30] why he was born
[1:04:32] why he had to die and the most important
[1:04:36] part
[1:04:38] rise again
[1:04:41] I just want to start in a simple way
[1:04:45] in this America
[1:04:47] or in this world
[1:04:49] we have more preachers in this age
[1:04:54] than we've ever had
[1:04:57] two days before don't do please don't
[1:05:00] touch
[1:05:01] because
[1:05:02] there are churches almost on every
[1:05:05] corner
[1:05:08] yet the Bible says that this is a day of
[1:05:12] famine
[1:05:14] and the famine in the land is for the
[1:05:17] hearing of the word
[1:05:21] is that right never
[1:05:24] in the history of this message
[1:05:30] we've had so many message preachers
[1:05:36] hallelujah hallelujah is that right more
[1:05:40] than ever before
[1:05:43] but my question is
[1:05:45] where is the living statue of Christ
[1:05:49] wait let statues last statue is the
[1:05:52] Living Word
[1:05:54] where is the living Thunder
[1:05:58] Hallelujah is that right exclusive right
[1:06:01] and the reason being is because we have
[1:06:05] done the same thing
[1:06:07] the churches
[1:06:11] we hear the words
[1:06:13] but we have no understanding
[1:06:17] we don't understand the meaning
[1:06:20] we don't understand the relationship
[1:06:24] that the word of God
[1:06:27] to give us
[1:06:30] hallelujah
[1:06:31] when when when Adam said unto Eve
[1:07:41] where she came from do
[1:08:00] he was also referring to himself
[1:08:04] because God is a man
[1:08:09] is that right and so as he created a
[1:08:12] wife
[1:08:14] for uh Adam who I don't
[1:08:18] he created a wife for himself
[1:08:22] hallelujah it's so much Adam that he
[1:08:26] cannot be complete without us
[1:08:29] complex so new Hallelujah
[1:08:33] Hallelujah you ever seen something that
[1:08:35] you
[1:08:40] and you might ask the person who knows
[1:08:43] what is foreign
[1:09:10] utensils
[1:09:13] I would have never known that they were
[1:09:15] utensils to eat with because they did
[1:09:17] they just don't see to me they look like
[1:09:20] little miniature drumsticks
[1:09:23] but because somebody knew what they were
[1:09:28] and they understood the purpose
[1:09:36] is that right to eat with pumonji and
[1:09:41] I've still not mastered it amen
[1:09:46] you understand me it's the same way with
[1:09:50] any any culture
[1:09:53] perhaps you can find a culture today
[1:09:57] they've never seen a spoon or fall
[1:10:00] in Korea well you know though both of
[1:10:03] them are utensils to eat with
[1:10:05] Massachusetts
[1:10:08] they have different purposes
[1:10:11] because you know how to use them
[1:10:16] to that
[1:10:18] individuals
[1:10:21] I'm saying all these things for a
[1:10:23] purpose
[1:10:24] there's a meaning yeah
[1:10:31] and what Christians have lost
[1:10:34] they have lost their meaning
[1:10:38] Hallelujah and when it comes to meaning
[1:10:42] it's the expressing of the relationship
[1:10:45] was explaining
[1:10:57] amen amen
[1:10:59] yeah
[1:11:01] when we think about gonna do Punk song
[1:11:05] why do we uh
[1:11:08] what was this whole Calvary about
[1:11:14] it it was it was it was actually to uh
[1:11:18] re-established
[1:11:20] the love of God
[1:11:23] Into the Heart of his bride the only
[1:11:26] curl the sunny Boos you see Jesus died
[1:11:29] from a broken heart is
[1:11:33] but in his soul man don't he knew that a
[1:11:37] true bride
[1:11:39] a true being
[1:11:41] a true Christian would come along and
[1:11:45] have the relationships
[1:11:47] with him a victory that he had in his
[1:11:51] mind keep on saying hallelujah if that's
[1:11:54] why Jesus even said super questions he
[1:11:57] said if you overcome you don't have any
[1:11:59] situation
[1:12:01] to sit with me
[1:12:05] in my book even I have said in my father
[1:12:08] foreign
[1:12:12] foreign
[1:12:41] and yet we
[1:12:44] we're satisfied with one service a week
[1:12:46] new songs
[1:12:51] reading perhaps one book a year
[1:12:55] with lack of tithing support
[1:12:59] no Bible reading at all
[1:13:03] you don't teach your children the word
[1:13:05] of the uh or meanings
[1:13:10] you know it's like this we say don't
[1:13:13] commit fornication
[1:13:18] they won't understand
[1:13:20] what's the meaning
[1:13:24] why is fornication wrong
[1:13:28] hallelujah hallelujah you must teach
[1:13:30] this go to the word of God show them
[1:13:35] examples
[1:13:36] of what that kind of thing will produce
[1:13:42] it will bring a reverence
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:13:47] but because you lay a law down doesn't
[1:13:51] mean they understand what you mean
[1:13:54] because you never explains
[1:14:01] so what happens to them
[1:14:04] they go out living a miserable life
[1:14:10] transgressing the word of God
[1:14:13] because they don't understand
[1:14:17] why they should not
[1:14:27] is that all right
[1:14:29] what is your relationship with Christ
[1:14:33] so I'm in the message
[1:14:36] what does that means
[1:14:40] foreign
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:49] does it mean that
[1:14:51] exclusivity of God is revealed to me
[1:14:54] yeah
[1:14:59] what does it mean I'm in the message
[1:15:01] just read ornament signs what does it
[1:15:04] mean to you yes your relationship
[1:15:08] with the message
[1:15:10] because that's just Christ at least
[1:15:16] what does it mean to you
[1:15:20] why are you a Christian
[1:15:22] what is your meaning for being one
[1:15:25] what is the purpose of it so I can
[1:15:29] escape here
[1:15:30] so I can miss make a Rapture I don't
[1:15:34] know if I can go to heaven
[1:15:36] what is it what is sequence see you got
[1:15:39] to understand
[1:15:41] Calvary wasn't just a historical events
[1:15:48] every time a Christian
[1:15:53] to themselves
[1:16:01] what does it mean
[1:16:04] the word is life what does this Bible
[1:16:08] mean to you
[1:16:09] that's that's the that's the that Bible
[1:16:12] is the word oh six pounds
[1:16:16] how much do you fellowship with it
[1:16:20] foreign
[1:16:37] I'm I'm throwing things at you
[1:16:40] because I want you to understand that's
[1:16:43] because you have a reason for beings
[1:16:49] what good is a light bulb
[1:16:53] in lump if you don't plug it up in the
[1:16:56] socket
[1:16:58] cut it off
[1:17:00] Christians need to be cut on
[1:17:03] because the Bible said you're the light
[1:17:05] of the world
[1:17:46] he's the same yesterday
[1:17:52] The Power of Words
[1:17:56] supersedes any action of kindness
[1:18:00] yes dinner
[1:18:03] any action of kindness
[1:18:06] for example if you take your wife out to
[1:18:09] dinner
[1:18:11] and there are no words spoken between
[1:18:14] you and yeah
[1:18:21] is that right
[1:18:24] um you know you take her out and and
[1:18:26] move out there they can like for example
[1:18:30] I was down at Gray's Lake some years ago
[1:18:35] I assume it was husband and wife
[1:18:39] and I assume that the the the the the
[1:18:41] the boat rides were supposed to be
[1:18:43] romantic
[1:18:47] and I thought it was so strange
[1:18:50] that they were in the same boat with no
[1:18:54] communication
[1:18:55] they both were texting on their phones
[1:19:06] what is
[1:19:08] love
[1:19:13] y'all understand what I'm saying I'm
[1:19:16] coming to where I'm going I'm just I'm
[1:19:17] just playing in the background because I
[1:19:19] said this is part one
[1:19:21] hallelujah hallelujah you know have
[1:19:25] somebody ever said something to you
[1:19:28] and you said okay
[1:19:32] what did you mean by that
[1:19:36] did you really really mean that
[1:19:41] because you want to understand
[1:19:44] what's being said
[1:19:47] whatever is being said
[1:19:50] affect you in a positive
[1:19:54] ways
[1:19:57] hallelujah hallelujah words have power
[1:20:00] on the prisons people say
[1:20:04] Sticks and Stones let me break my bones
[1:20:08] foreign
[1:20:30] Hallelujah
[1:20:32] voice of the words
[1:20:39] because the Lord means what he says
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:45] and he says what he means
[1:20:48] the whole Bible is a love affair
[1:20:54] is that right it's a love affairs God
[1:20:59] has for his creation
[1:21:02] and if you're in the world
[1:21:05] you'll be in the words
[1:21:36] in the daytime
[1:21:48] if I was a woman
[1:21:51] I would say to that guy said Tom
[1:21:55] if you are ashamed of me
[1:21:58] being with me in the daytime
[1:22:00] you can't be with me
[1:22:07] y'all doesn't know what I'm talking
[1:22:08] about
[1:22:09] so I'm seeing this if you are ashamed of
[1:22:14] Jesus Christ
[1:22:19] and you can only fellowship with him
[1:22:23] when nobody else can see you
[1:22:27] that's not a real Fellowship
[1:22:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:37] the Bible says that we must be instant
[1:22:41] in season and out of season
[1:22:45] in season
[1:22:47] and out of season
[1:22:49] that means Jesus Christ it's supposed to
[1:22:53] be do I asked
[1:22:56] you hallelujah hallelujah you know
[1:23:01] my wife and I my family was at some kind
[1:23:05] of yard sale
[1:23:07] and there were some Pentecostal people
[1:23:09] out soon
[1:23:13] you know no makeup you know long dresses
[1:23:18] but they look so sad
[1:23:22] they look so good he's happy he's a
[1:23:25] detect Easter
[1:23:27] foreign
[1:23:45] [Applause]
[1:24:33] amen
[1:24:35] I had a sister is that even sir when she
[1:24:38] didn't want to share any of her food
[1:24:40] coin foreign
[1:24:50] she would do it like this
[1:25:00] you know or she would do something to
[1:25:02] her food
[1:25:06] to make sure you didn't want it
[1:25:15] that's what you call selfish
[1:25:17] but when she wanted something shoes
[1:25:25] make Junior give me some of that because
[1:25:29] I understand what I'm saying this
[1:25:32] selfishness
[1:25:33] throughout her whole life
[1:25:38] but she claimed to be a Christian
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:45] oh Lord have mercy I gotta say this one
[1:25:47] more than I get back to the world one
[1:25:50] day I was at her house
[1:25:52] took her to the grocery store you don't
[1:25:54] you know we bought two big buckets of
[1:25:57] food news
[1:25:58] brought it back home
[1:26:00] she cooked chicken
[1:26:02] I love chicken
[1:26:06] I guess I fit the picture
[1:26:10] preachers love chicken lately
[1:26:12] but the point of the matter is
[1:26:15] I think I ate three pieces
[1:26:20] and she said on her breath
[1:26:23] foreign
[1:26:44] amen amen because what his purpose for
[1:26:48] but success
[1:26:57] all of the arrogance
[1:26:59] everything that the world brought to us
[1:27:03] God came to undo it if you need
[1:27:06] hallelujah hallelujah he came to bring
[1:27:09] us into a place
[1:27:12] that the glory in which he had with the
[1:27:16] father
[1:27:17] we may see it
[1:27:20] and we would be one even as he is
[1:27:27] you hear what I'm saying he's not done
[1:27:29] this because his Christian walk is a
[1:27:31] journey
[1:27:32] I wish
[1:27:34] I I wish to God
[1:27:39] one two three
[1:28:20] I want to understand my meaning
[1:28:25] see if I came here
[1:28:27] stir you up in your spirit
[1:28:30] on what to explain
[1:28:32] so that you can have a great time
[1:28:35] I'm missing the mark
[1:28:38] the message came to change
[1:28:42] and so I can't just be preaching good
[1:28:45] stuff
[1:28:48] I have to bring the thing that's gonna
[1:28:50] like the knife cut some things out of
[1:28:52] you yeah

[1:34:30] I was told something the other day
[1:34:32] I say the other day but uh
[1:34:35] it's been sometimes
[1:34:39] there's some women some sisters
[1:34:42] don't believe that they need the Holy
[1:34:44] Ghost
[1:34:45] when you satisfy because the Bible says
[1:34:49] they should be saved through
[1:34:51] childbearing he do I keep going
[1:34:53] according
[1:34:54] um
[1:34:55] ask God what does that means
[1:35:00] do you think you can be just a sinner
[1:35:04] because your husband is safe
[1:35:07] and you have children for him you're
[1:35:10] going to heaven everybody that is alive
[1:35:15] you must be born again
[1:35:20] Mary had to be born again
[1:35:25] you gonna
[1:35:26] happen again
[1:35:28] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:35:31] saved Soviet
[1:35:34] in childbearing means that you'll be
[1:35:36] here
[1:35:37] God will take care of you
[1:35:41] Hallelujah say the word save me
[1:35:44] Hallelujah
[1:35:48] oh my goodness if that be the case
[1:35:51] there's a lot of women out there that
[1:35:53] you already saved yeah
[1:35:55] because they don't have a lot of
[1:35:57] children
[1:35:58] but they're still going to the bar
[1:36:04] that's not what it means but you'll take
[1:36:06] whatever the preacher says
[1:36:13] God and sincerity what it means
[1:36:18] I feel like I'm running through this
[1:36:21] place right now
[1:36:27] sisters y'all need to know the message
[1:36:28] too
[1:36:29] don't let nobody tell you you don't need
[1:36:32] to know this is
[1:36:41] and you count on your husband to get you
[1:36:43] there if you wish
[1:36:53] you never understand the meaning
[1:36:58] there is a reason even for the husband
[1:37:02] that you've chosen you can remember
[1:37:08] and you know what sometimes
[1:37:11] there's nothing much
[1:37:15] married and we had children
[1:37:18] what is the reason why God put you with
[1:37:22] that individuals
[1:37:29] you think he did that just to make you
[1:37:30] miserable
[1:37:35] Hallelujah yeah all marriages are not
[1:37:38] happy
[1:37:40] but there's a purpose
[1:37:45] you say God I don't want to be just like
[1:37:47] you you did you send your answers God
[1:37:50] said I'm gonna use the best tool I got
[1:37:51] and you said
[1:37:54] whether it be the male or the female
[1:37:56] cause that's right look what God did
[1:37:59] with Moses
[1:38:08] Hallelujah and if it wasn't for zapporo
[1:38:11] is this Moses would have been killed by
[1:38:14] God
[1:38:17] so if it was just that one purpose alone
[1:38:24] I'd love to pick up her son foreskin
[1:38:31] and say you bloody husband
[1:38:39] your bloody husband
[1:38:42] I don't know how to say it

[1:57:35] but when it's all over
[1:57:39] what does it mean to you
[1:57:46] you know sometimes the powerful
[1:57:49] we desire God and don't know it's gone
[1:57:57] when it comes to come
[1:58:01] job
[1:58:07] and Joe which do all he did go through
[1:58:12] he had no idea
[1:58:16] that how many millions of people in the
[1:58:18] world we don't you call me in the media
[1:58:20] on the Pepto God took one name
[1:58:23] and said there's none like him yeah okay
[1:58:30] do you really think job did that on his
[1:58:33] own
[1:58:33] he had a contact with God
[1:58:37] that's why Joe was a perfect man
[1:58:42] unless the perfect God is in the man
[1:58:45] I'm almost done
[1:58:48] but my thing is to get you thinking
[1:58:51] what does it mean to be a Christian
[1:58:54] what is my meaning what is
[1:58:57] my meaning what is my relationship
[1:59:01] amen what is my relationship with the
[1:59:06] god I claim I mean

[1:59:47] and every minute of the day a shackman
[1:59:50] used to do it has to be drawing from the
[1:59:52] earth
[1:59:55] see what does it do with this virtue
[1:59:58] that it draws it gets crucified
[2:00:01] it gives it out
[2:00:05] it makes a beautiful sight for the
[2:00:07] admirer
[2:00:10] sidonians
[2:00:13] it opens up itself for honey
[2:00:17] for the bee to come and get its parts
[2:00:22] and don't complain and and so complaint
[2:00:27] answer complaining Christians we're so
[2:00:30] good at complaining

[2:00:35] I was looking at the clothes in my
[2:00:37] closet yeah
[2:00:39] maybe the day before yesterday
[2:00:44] and I was thanking God for it
[2:00:50] but then you know what I saw vanity
