[47:32] scriptures we want to be turning to the

[47:38] Chapter we want to greet you tonight in
[47:40] the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:43] Christ sure appreciate the opportunity
[47:45] and invitation for our brother Brooks to
[47:47] be here once
[47:51] again I think the last time we were
[47:54] here was uh
[47:57] 2014 so it's been a few days since we've
[47:59] been here but we sure thank the Lord for
[48:03] allowing us to come back once
[48:05] again sure appreciate brother Brooks and
[48:07] sister
[48:09] Ruby God bless you all in the stand for
[48:11] the message and the work of the Lord
[48:13] you've done we appreciate
[48:15] that amen and bring a greetings from our
[48:18] pastor our church at
[48:21] home brother sea Martin brother pastor
[48:25] we bring readings from
[48:27] him and the last time I was
[48:31] here I wasn't
[48:33] married but now I'm married and got a
[48:35] little boy
[48:37] Malachi bringing greetings from our
[48:39] family as
[48:42] well the Book of Genesis the 19th
[48:46] Chapter and in the first
[48:48] verse the Bible said There came two
[48:52] angels to Sodom at evening and lot sat
[48:55] in in the gate of Sodom and lot seeing
[48:58] them rose up to meet them and he bowed
[49:01] himself with his face toward the
[49:13] ground now I want you to notice the
[49:15] Bible here
[49:17] says that lot sat in the
[49:21] gate but if we go back to Genesis 18 and
[49:24] verse one
[49:28] the Bible speaks of another
[49:30] man and his name was
[49:33] Abraham and the Bible said in verse
[49:36] one the Lord appeared unto him in the
[49:39] plains of mamry and he sat in the tent
[49:42] Door In the Heat of the
[49:50] day so lot sat in the
[49:53] gate but Abraham in the
[49:57] door now in the book of Hebrews the 13th
[50:02] chapter I want to read a portion of
[50:04] scripture
[50:06] there Hebrews 13 beginning in verse
[50:11] 9 Paul here
[50:13] writing he says be not carried about
[50:16] with diverse and strange doctrines for
[50:19] it is a good thing that the heart be
[50:21] established with Grace and not with
[50:23] Meats which have not profited them that
[50:26] have been occupied
[50:37] therein now in verse 10 I want you to
[50:40] notice how he says
[50:43] this we have an
[50:45] altar whereever they have no right to
[50:48] eat which serve the
[50:51] Tabernacle so we are not looking for an
[50:54] altar
[50:55] but we are in possession of an
[50:58] altar for the bodies of those Beast
[51:01] whose blood is brought into the
[51:02] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[51:05] burned without the
[51:09] [Music]
[51:12] camp now wherefore Jesus also that he
[51:15] might sanctify the people with his own
[51:17] blood suffered without the
[51:24] gate
[51:27] now let us go forth therefore unto him
[51:30] without the camp bearing his
[51:37] reproach for here we have no continuing
[51:41] City but we seek one to
[51:47] come on the altar as close as I can get
[51:51] to
[51:52] him see that's where my expect ations
[51:56] is is on the
[51:59] altar waiting for his
[52:02] appearing so we are living in a day of
[52:05] going
[52:06] Beyond brother BR says it's a day when
[52:09] people are going beyond the
[52:12] camp he said in
[52:14] everything they're going Beyond so the
[52:17] world is going
[52:19] Beyond religion is going Beyond politics
[52:23] is going Beyond see it's all going
[52:26] beyond the
[52:28] camp now that word
[52:30] Camp it is a place with temporary
[52:35] accommodations it is a temporary
[52:37] dwelling
[52:39] place so in other words we cannot make a
[52:43] temporary Dwelling
[52:46] Place a permanent dwelling
[52:48] place so we've got to go there but we
[52:52] cannot stay there see the reason we
[52:55] cannot stay there is because there's
[52:58] more to go
[52:59] to so we go there but we move on now in
[53:04] Genesis
[53:05] 13 the Bible speaks of Abraham and
[53:08] lot and the Bible says that
[53:12] Abraham and lot's hgan began to have
[53:16] Strife now in Genesis
[53:19] 13 the Bible is speaking of a
[53:23] separation the reason Reon there was a
[53:26] separation is because the prophet said
[53:30] that Abraham was an heir to the
[53:34] world see but lot was a type of the Lorn
[53:38] believer he was a Believer he had left
[53:42] his
[53:45] homeland to SE on with
[53:48] God but never fully
[53:52] surrendered brother said that's the
[53:54] trouble today
[53:56] people has left the
[53:58] world they keep out of the
[54:00] world they don't want to go gambling
[54:03] they don't want to go drinking they are
[54:05] a
[54:06] Believer but they never made a complete
[54:10] surrender so lot was a type of the Lorn
[54:15] believer another
[54:18] place said lot was a type of
[54:22] America another place he said he was a
[54:24] type of the church
[54:27] natural that was down in
[54:29] Sodom the
[54:32] organization another place he says lot
[54:35] being a type again of a carinal
[54:38] [Music]
[54:39] Believer so lot was a Lorn believer he
[54:43] was a type of America he was a type of
[54:46] organization he was a type of a caral
[54:49] Believer and he could only go so far so
[54:54] Abraham and lot had to
[54:56] separate because Abraham was air to more
[55:00] than lot
[55:02] was now you know that God wants
[55:06] separators and the world wants
[55:09] mixtures Abraham was a
[55:12] separator lot was a
[55:15] mixer but God called
[55:18] Abraham to a total
[55:21] separation because God
[55:24] requires complete
[55:26] separation from all the world in order
[55:29] to bring him into what he was air
[55:34] to lot went through the
[55:38] gate but he didn't stop there he went on
[55:41] to the
[55:42] door lot sorry lot went to the
[55:46] gate he stopped there but Abraham went
[55:50] on because God required more of Abraham
[55:56] now I believe what the prophet said he
[55:58] said God requires
[56:01] Holiness he requires the new birth and
[56:05] he requires a separation from
[56:08] sin now can I just lay this uh in this
[56:11] thought in
[56:13] here that sometimes
[56:17] advancement requires
[56:21] separation in order to
[56:23] separate
[56:25] you have to be
[56:27] called and there will be a
[56:29] strength to
[56:32] separate and
[56:34] Advance now when you
[56:36] separate you separate from
[56:40] something to something so you're not
[56:43] just
[56:44] separating and remaining
[56:47] Idol but you're
[56:49] separating because there's a call to
[56:52] move into
[56:53] something amen you separate from the
[56:56] world to move into Christ you separate
[57:00] from
[57:01] unbelief to move into Faith you separate
[57:05] from the world to move into God see
[57:09] Jesus constantly told
[57:12] us there is a
[57:15] separation he said there will be a final
[57:18] separation where he will separate the
[57:20] sheep from the
[57:22] goats now do you all believe
[57:26] do you believe that God has continually
[57:29] been
[57:31] separating that's what he's doing
[57:34] tonight see he's
[57:37] separating Faith from
[57:40] unbelief you will never take your
[57:43] inheritance by
[57:46] unbelief Faith
[57:49] overcomes every
[57:51] devil every
[57:53] situation every problem
[57:56] faith is the victory that overcometh the
[58:01] world now the Bible said that the first
[58:04] man Adam he separated himself and the
[58:09] prophet said from the word to go with
[58:12] his wife so Adam was walking with the
[58:16] word but he separates from the word to
[58:20] his
[58:21] wife said in the end time
[58:25] he says in the end time that the carnal
[58:29] believer is going to separate from the
[58:32] word to the
[58:34] church so lot is going to separate from
[58:38] the word to the
[58:41] church and he's going to set in the
[58:44] gate see the word requires a
[58:48] total and complete
[58:51] separation so while the carnal believer
[58:54] is
[58:55] separating from the word to the church
[59:00] the seat of Abraham is separating from
[59:03] the church to the word see lot was
[59:07] satisfied with the
[59:09] church Abraham was a to
[59:12] more just the church he was air to the
[59:17] word I believe that we're on a
[59:21] journey I believe there are steps in our
[59:23] journey
[59:25] I believe that we are on a journey of
[59:28] growth and I believe as long as we are
[59:31] here we are growing in
[59:34] Christ see there's always room to
[59:38] grow now Paul will say
[59:41] this he will say that we're growing into
[59:44] the measure of the stature of the
[59:46] fullness of
[59:46] [Music]
[59:50] Christ so the natural types the
[59:53] spiritual
[59:55] okay you all are here
[59:57] tonight but you didn't start where you
[1:00:01] are born an
[1:00:03] infant you moved from infant into
[1:00:07] child from Child into
[1:00:10] teenage into
[1:00:13] adult what you were doing is in your
[1:00:16] human Journey you were
[1:00:19] gr now another word for
[1:00:22] stature is maturity
[1:00:25] so Paul was saying that we would come to
[1:00:28] the measure of the
[1:00:32] maturity of the fullness of Christ now I
[1:00:35] love that word
[1:00:37] fullness because in the New Testament it
[1:00:40] is the body of
[1:00:42] Believers which is filled with the
[1:00:45] presence the power the agency and the
[1:00:49] riches of God in
[1:00:53] Christ do you see see who you are you're
[1:00:56] not a carnal church
[1:00:58] member you are the stature of the
[1:01:02] fullness of Christ we're in the power of
[1:01:06] God the presence of God the richness of
[1:01:10] God is dwelling in a
[1:01:14] body now right after Paul says
[1:01:17] that he turns and says that we
[1:01:22] henceforth be no more children
[1:01:25] because a child is tossed to and
[1:01:29] fro they're carried about with every
[1:01:32] wind of
[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:34] Doctrine by the Slate of men by the
[1:01:38] Slate of
[1:01:39] men cunning
[1:01:43] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:01:48] deceive but now watch Paul he says but
[1:01:52] we speak the truth and love
[1:01:57] grow
[1:01:58] up into him in all
[1:02:01] things which is the
[1:02:04] head even Christ I love that word
[1:02:08] grow because it means to
[1:02:11] increase it means to become
[1:02:14] greater so Born Again
[1:02:16] Christians they
[1:02:18] increase into the stature of
[1:02:22] Christ as they live
[1:02:25] see as you live one trial leads to
[1:02:29] another trial leads to another trial and
[1:02:33] you're not
[1:02:35] diminishing you're not
[1:02:37] decreasing but you're getting
[1:02:39] greater we're not at the bottom of the
[1:02:42] pyramid we have climbed to the top we
[1:02:46] are not at the foundation stone we have
[1:02:49] climbed Seven Ages we are at the top of
[1:02:53] the pyramid
[1:02:55] where the
[1:02:56] headship is not a man it's not a
[1:03:00] personality it's not a church it's Jesus
[1:03:03] Christ in the power of his resurrection
[1:03:07] in the authority of his word list we're
[1:03:10] not getting weaker we're not getting
[1:03:13] smaller we're growing we're
[1:03:16] increasing one Victory another Victory
[1:03:20] another victory until the fullness of
[1:03:23] Christ
[1:03:25] is dwelling in the flesh of the
[1:03:28] Bride we're not
[1:03:30] defeated we are the sons of God Amen we
[1:03:34] are
[1:03:35] growing into
[1:03:37] manhood into the
[1:03:40] stature of the fullness of
[1:03:43] Christ now I just got to say what the
[1:03:45] prophet
[1:03:46] said he said we're always
[1:03:49] talking about how bad the world is
[1:03:52] getting we're always talking how bad the
[1:03:56] world is getting but we are forgetting
[1:04:00] how
[1:04:01] powerful the church is
[1:04:03] becoming at the same time at the same
[1:04:07] time that the world is getting
[1:04:11] worse the church is getting
[1:04:13] stronger now come on if you take that
[1:04:16] stature of a perfect man and you lay it
[1:04:20] down brother brother Isaiah if we could
[1:04:22] lay it down we would start walking and
[1:04:26] when we start walking it's really wide
[1:04:30] but the closer you get to The
[1:04:32] Headstone the more narrow it
[1:04:35] becomes in other words it'll be less
[1:04:40] people but more
[1:04:42] power it'll be less as she nears The
[1:04:47] Headstone she will be fewer in
[1:04:50] number but she will be greater in power
[1:04:54] Old Church of the Living God can you see
[1:04:57] who you are we are not away from The
[1:05:00] Headstone we have Arisen to The
[1:05:03] Headstone and the power of God is in the
[1:05:07] church the church is growing now I know
[1:05:10] what you're saying how is the church
[1:05:13] growing well the prophet of God said God
[1:05:17] through the Holy
[1:05:19] Spirit Reveals His
[1:05:21] word by manifesting it
[1:05:24] and vindicating it
[1:05:27] himself showing that it's his word being
[1:05:32] brought to
[1:05:33] pass in the day that it's
[1:05:36] promised so in other words the church is
[1:05:40] growing by the
[1:05:42] revelation of the
[1:05:45] Vindicated manifested word of almighty
[1:05:48] God the
[1:05:51] manifestation of the word is the
[1:05:55] Vindication in other words in Genesis 1
[1:05:59] he said let there be
[1:06:01] light he spoke the word the word come
[1:06:05] into
[1:06:07] manifestation and there was light the
[1:06:10] light was the spoken word the light was
[1:06:14] the
[1:06:15] manifestation and the light was the
[1:06:19] Vindication amen the
[1:06:22] manifestation Oh Glory to God
[1:06:24] the
[1:06:25] Vindication and the spoken word all
[1:06:29] gathered into one
[1:06:30] thing and it was the light church do you
[1:06:34] know what the prophet said he said you
[1:06:36] are the spoken word
[1:06:40] see you are the spoken word
[1:06:43] bride there will be a
[1:06:46] manifestation of that spoken word and
[1:06:49] there will be a
[1:06:50] Vindication of that spoken word to the
[1:06:54] world you're just another church in
[1:06:57] another
[1:06:58] building but to God you are the
[1:07:02] Gathering of the spoken word the
[1:07:05] manifested word the Vindicated word has
[1:07:09] not gathered in the heavens it's not
[1:07:12] gathered in the ground it's gathered In
[1:07:14] the Flesh of the of Jesus Christ we are
[1:07:19] not staying where we were we're
[1:07:22] gr the
[1:07:26] Aly God I know who you are the
[1:07:31] word I can read what a prophet
[1:07:34] said I can look at you and say this day
[1:07:38] this scripture is fulfilled In the Flesh
[1:07:43] of the Bride of Jesus Christ you are
[1:07:49] word the
[1:07:52] word not part Baptist part
[1:07:57] Pentecostal
[1:07:58] cathol your word sail through and
[1:08:03] through now what is the word
[1:08:06] Bri she's the manifestation of this
[1:08:10] hour the bride not a Creed or
[1:08:14] denomination she's a living Oracle of
[1:08:18] God she is a living attribute of
[1:08:21] God and she is just pling to the
[1:08:24] world the attributes of God in the
[1:08:29] formation of the Bride that's to be
[1:08:32] expressed in the hour we're now living
[1:08:35] in see then this church will come into
[1:08:40] Christ now watch a prophet and we'll
[1:08:43] come on out to the full
[1:08:46] stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for
[1:08:49] this last day now can I say what he said
[1:08:53] for the bride in the
[1:08:56] Rapture will come
[1:08:59] forth all there is all pre-planned by
[1:09:03] God and it's all back
[1:09:06] up listen you say brother Andrew if I
[1:09:10] just had somebody behind
[1:09:12] me I just had somebody backing me I just
[1:09:16] somebody support
[1:09:18] me if you got this
[1:09:20] word if you got the word of God on your
[1:09:24] side then Heaven is behind you God is
[1:09:28] behind you the angels are behind you
[1:09:32] there is going to be a bride there is
[1:09:35] going to be a Rapture there's going to
[1:09:37] be an
[1:09:39] overcomer Heaven has
[1:09:41] spoken the Bible has recorded it the
[1:09:44] holy spirit is here to
[1:09:48] manifest God there a nothing the devil
[1:09:51] can
[1:09:52] do
[1:09:55] it's been spoken so shall it
[1:09:58] be God is going to have a mature
[1:10:02] church God is going to have a mature
[1:10:06] Church he's going to have an adopted
[1:10:09] Church brother said I believe we've been
[1:10:12] children long
[1:10:15] enough is going to turn his
[1:10:18] church into manhood
[1:10:21] now now if we're going to talk about man
[1:10:25] we've got to talk about
[1:10:27] responsibility if we're going to talk
[1:10:29] about
[1:10:30] maturity we got to talk about
[1:10:33] responsibility because with
[1:10:35] manhood comes more
[1:10:41] responsibility it's a very it's a very
[1:10:43] simple
[1:10:45] illustration you take a kid he wakes up
[1:10:48] in the morning his throat is
[1:10:51] sore he's got a bit of a cough
[1:10:54] so he goes in the living room and he
[1:10:57] says Mom I don't feel like going to
[1:10:59] school
[1:11:00] today she says okay go back in there and
[1:11:03] go to bed so he goes back in there and
[1:11:06] lays
[1:11:07] down okay what did he
[1:11:10] miss he might have missed
[1:11:13] recess he might have missed a
[1:11:16] test he might have missed a a field trip
[1:11:19] or
[1:11:20] something there's not that much
[1:11:22] responsibility
[1:11:25] but you let a grown man wake up in the
[1:11:28] morning he's got a sore
[1:11:30] throat he's got a little
[1:11:32] call he Ain feeling the
[1:11:35] greatest he don't go in there and say
[1:11:39] honey I'm not going to be able to go to
[1:11:41] work no he goes on the work because if
[1:11:45] he don't there's some bills to be
[1:11:48] paid to be
[1:11:50] fed when you move from childhood in the
[1:11:54] manhood there is a
[1:11:57] responsibility in other words we no
[1:12:00] longer Pentecostal bab we're no longer
[1:12:03] just playing with the word of God the
[1:12:06] message of the hour is an adoption
[1:12:09] message aage of authority a of power and
[1:12:14] it has transformed
[1:12:16] us born Sons into adopted Sons listen we
[1:12:22] know how to take the devil now we know
[1:12:25] how to handle
[1:12:26] TR I could preach here could I when we
[1:12:30] was when we were in
[1:12:31] childhood somebody hurt our feelings we
[1:12:34] didn't worship we didn't clap our hands
[1:12:38] we didn't praise God we just stayed
[1:12:41] home when we moved into
[1:12:44] manhood we learned how to worship
[1:12:48] God praise
[1:12:52] God how to prach when we didn't feel
[1:12:56] like preaching because we're
[1:13:00] growing maturity where the power of God
[1:13:05] is

[1:18:03] playing music a Finish
[1:18:06] Line somebody's got to cross
[1:18:09] it I tell you what the Bible said the
[1:18:13] Bible said Israel had a
[1:18:15] journey the Bible said their Journey LED
[1:18:18] them by the way of the Red
[1:18:21] Sea by the way of Mount
[1:18:25] sier they went to the Red Sea they went
[1:18:29] to mount sier and they started going
[1:18:32] around they started going
[1:18:34] around and the prophet rose up said Len
[1:18:39] he have compassed this
[1:18:41] mountain
[1:18:43] long
[1:18:44] turn northward come on Church what
[1:18:48] turned the church behold I will send you
[1:18:51] a lie to the prophet
[1:18:53] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:18:56] children to the faith of the fathers
[1:18:59] it's in
[1:19:01] Corinthians Veil remain on the heart
[1:19:05] until this day but there shall be a day
[1:19:09] and it shall be known unto the Lord the
[1:19:12] heart shall turn to
[1:19:16] godil that away with and you will see
[1:19:19] Jesus Christ The Mighty God
[1:19:26] in other words go beyond this
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] mountain but they settled
[1:19:35] down and the prophet of God said a short
[1:19:39] Journey turned into
[1:19:42] years of wandering in the
[1:19:46] wilderness in other words God had
[1:19:49] already
[1:19:50] provided everything they need
[1:19:53] needed from there to the full
[1:19:56] promise he provided him a Passover
[1:19:59] land for their
[1:20:01] sins he provided them a prophet as their
[1:20:06] instructor the angel was their
[1:20:09] gu Grace had provided them
[1:20:13] everything are y'all ready for this one
[1:20:16] Grace had provided them a way of
[1:20:20] escape from Egypt
[1:20:23] before there was a
[1:20:25] law so before there was a law there was
[1:20:29] already a
[1:20:30] Grace made them a way of
[1:20:33] Escape before they first went into the
[1:20:36] mud
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:39] pits had already
[1:20:41] projected and made a way of
[1:20:44] Escape Church of the Living God before
[1:20:47] you ever come into
[1:20:49] Le the grace of God already been
[1:20:54] projected this age make a way of
[1:20:58] escape and Jesus
[1:21:00] said
[1:21:02] yourself blessed that you've been found
[1:21:06] worthy to escape the tribulation that's
[1:21:11] coming up on the
[1:21:12] earth Peter said that through these
[1:21:16] virtues you would have St the corruption
[1:21:19] that is in the world so before there was
[1:21:23] a corrupt nature there was a divine
[1:21:26] nature and the divine nature had already
[1:21:30] made a way for you to escape the
[1:21:34] corrupted nature and to escape the
[1:21:38] world oh Church said the children of
[1:21:42] Israel started on their Journey he said
[1:21:45] it was a perfect time of the church
[1:21:48] today see we're making our way to the
[1:21:50] glory
[1:21:51] land he said don't you believe that
[1:21:54] we're each
[1:21:55] day gaining a little
[1:21:57] ground see what are we doing we're
[1:22:00] moving on up can I make a statement
[1:22:04] tonight God's church is not going
[1:22:07] down we are moving up I don't care how
[1:22:11] hard it is I don't care how difficult it
[1:22:14] is we are not going down we are rising
[1:22:19] up can I tell you why because God
[1:22:24] foreseen which means he
[1:22:26] ordained a church that was to appear
[1:22:29] before
[1:22:30] him so before there was a
[1:22:34] Lea in the back part of God's mind there
[1:22:38] was ordained Church to escape the
[1:22:42] corruption of the world and to stand
[1:22:45] before him as the woman of Ephesians
[1:22:50] 5 now you all know how started that
[1:22:53] don't you he started with Luther the
[1:22:57] just shall live by faith he said then he
[1:22:59] raised up to John
[1:23:01] Wesley he said smash
[1:23:04] Calvinism he said then Along come the
[1:23:07] Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:10] Spirit see they were moving on up in the
[1:23:14] higher
[1:23:15] Heights but now come on church but now
[1:23:20] he said when the Brethren receive the
[1:23:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this
[1:23:27] is the
[1:23:28] summit this is all of it but Brethren
[1:23:31] that's wrong see there is no Summit to
[1:23:36] God's
[1:23:37] power we just move on
[1:23:41] on it's the unlimited
[1:23:45] resources God has never been tapped
[1:23:49] yet the blessings of God the powers of
[1:23:53] God it's never even been revealed to
[1:23:57] archangels it's l just ahead for the
[1:24:01] church are you ready for this for the
[1:24:04] church that will
[1:24:05] believe you say brother Andrew we fill
[1:24:08] up the building we'll break into those
[1:24:11] Revelations we'll break into those
[1:24:14] blessings if you got two or three that
[1:24:18] believe that Jesus Christ is in the
[1:24:21] midst of the church
[1:24:23] faith is the
[1:24:26] key the blessings of God you know what I
[1:24:30] say let's move on up let's move on up
[1:24:34] let's claim our
[1:24:36] rights I love what the prophet says he
[1:24:39] said as God opens the door swings open
[1:24:42] the
[1:24:43] gates let's move up into it don't you
[1:24:47] never colonize
[1:24:49] yourselves don't you never organize
[1:24:52] yourself
[1:24:54] see let's believe this plus how much
[1:24:57] more we can hear from
[1:24:58] God that ought be the motive of every
[1:25:01] man and woman that the
[1:25:04] Lord is to receive all you
[1:25:07] can from the hand of his Bountiful
[1:25:12] mercies okay to preach for a second you
[1:25:15] all know the prophet talk in the
[1:25:19] Masterpiece he will show you there three
[1:25:22] stages to a
[1:25:24] birth water blood and spirit but then
[1:25:29] he'll say four death
[1:25:33] Messengers they eat the tree down now
[1:25:36] four death Messengers eat it
[1:25:38] [Music]
[1:25:40] down messers will not restore
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:44] it four took it
[1:25:46] down it's going to take four to restore
[1:25:50] it so notice here
[1:25:53] the
[1:25:54] St the
[1:25:56] castle and
[1:25:57] the somebody say the life the life all
[1:26:02] gathers in the
[1:26:05] seed so everything that was in the stock
[1:26:09] was not thrown away everything in the
[1:26:11] tassle was not thrown away see

[1:26:16] hus was not all
[1:26:18] Shu there was seed in the sock there in
[1:26:22] the was SE in the L church and right
[1:26:27] here before me
[1:26:28] tonight all the life has gathered in the
[1:26:33] seed
[1:26:35] justification made way for
[1:26:37] sanctification made way for the
[1:26:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:26:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:26:46] the Holy Ghost
[1:26:48] it to come down in perfection
[1:26:54] back to the word
[1:26:55] again to manifest
[1:26:58] itself the fourth light was not the
[1:27:01] manifestation of a man it was the
[1:27:05] manifestation of the very life of God
[1:27:09] coming back in the
[1:27:11] flesh Oh Glory to God I challenge you to
[1:27:16] believe that the son of man is revealed
[1:27:21] in human
[1:27:23] the Bri's
[1:27:25] body see that's what's bringing us to
[1:27:29] adoption see you're not just church
[1:27:32] members you are
[1:27:34] prepared and anointed
[1:27:36] people that have been sent into this
[1:27:39] age to believe all
[1:27:42] things so as you believe you grow in
[1:27:47] Christ watch the
[1:27:49] Bible that you would come
[1:27:53] to the
[1:27:54] manifestation of the sons of God now can
[1:27:58] I say this to you powerful
[1:28:01] quote said God hid it from the eyes of
[1:28:03] the wiv
[1:28:05] of but he promised to reveal it to the
[1:28:08] sons of
[1:28:09] God in the last
[1:28:12] days when the sons of God would be made
[1:28:16] manifest when God's sons that rejoiced
[1:28:19] with him before the foundation of the
[1:28:21] world
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:25] when the Great revelation of the
[1:28:27] godhead things would be brought down in
[1:28:30] the last
[1:28:32] days he will manifest these things to
[1:28:35] the sons of God you know the scripture
[1:28:38] teaches
[1:28:40] that was the bringing of the word to
[1:28:44] reveal the secret of the
[1:28:46] Bible which the prophet of God
[1:28:50] said are divinely revealed mystery
[1:28:55] truths which were contained in the
[1:28:59] seals and he said that's what will give
[1:29:01] the bride rap
[1:29:03] shrink L those Thunders is not a
[1:29:07] man not a move it's not a
[1:29:11] cliche it's the infinite Mind Of
[1:29:15] God seal in the age we're living in and
[1:29:19] he's dropping those Revelations
[1:29:23] can I say this but they're not hitting
[1:29:25] the
[1:29:26] carpet they're not hitting the
[1:29:29] abew falling into prepared
[1:29:32] [Music]
[1:29:34] ground the Revival's coming Revival's
[1:29:37] coming I say the Revival is
[1:29:40] here we are not looking for the bride's
[1:29:44] Revival we are looking at the BR
[1:29:49] Revival are you hearing me we're not
[1:29:51] looking looking for the Revival we are
[1:29:54] looking at the
[1:29:58] Revival if you're looking for something
[1:30:02] you're not looking at
[1:30:03] it people say brother Andrew there's too
[1:30:06] much
[1:30:07] rejoicing there's too much shouting and
[1:30:10] dancing praising
[1:30:12] God the problem is I got scripture for
[1:30:16] it the Bible says there was a lost
[1:30:19] coin then the Bible said there was a
[1:30:21] lost
[1:30:24] son then the Bible said there was a l
[1:30:28] sheep now watch if you go read those
[1:30:32] Parables there was a time of
[1:30:35] looking and while they were looking they
[1:30:38] were not
[1:30:40] rejoicing but when they found what they
[1:30:43] were looking for they changed their
[1:30:46] language and called
[1:30:49] everybody and said Rejoice with me
[1:30:52] for what I was looking for I have
[1:30:56] found where is the wal
[1:30:59] Revival is it in a building is it in a
[1:31:04] preacher you're looking at the's
[1:31:07] Revival is the Bri's Revival is it in
[1:31:11] Virginia is it in Louisiana is it in
[1:31:14] Tennessee is it in Arizona is in our the
[1:31:18] Bri Revival is in the
[1:31:24] glory to God quickening power has
[1:31:27] quickened us we're no longer just
[1:31:29] looking at the word we are becoming the
[1:31:33] word and as he's revealing these
[1:31:36] things he's bringing his
[1:31:39] sons into
[1:31:41] manifestation so we do not become Sons
[1:31:44] by our
[1:31:45] emotion we do not become Sons by our
[1:31:48] feelings we become Sons by the
[1:31:52] manifestation of the
[1:31:55] word living how can I say this I love
[1:31:59] this quote brother said he's going
[1:32:02] beyond the
[1:32:04] limitations somebody said that with me
[1:32:07] he's going
[1:32:08] beyond the
[1:32:11] limitations any desire
[1:32:13] is his desire is to stop our
[1:32:17] growth see at one
[1:32:20] time we was in a horse and
[1:32:23] buggy but we moved
[1:32:25] on come on if you were going to move
[1:32:28] into the
[1:32:29] automobile you had to separate from the
[1:32:32] horse and
[1:32:33] buggy but you know what you didn't leave
[1:32:35] in the horse and buggy you didn't leave
[1:32:38] the
[1:32:39] power you took the power and added more
[1:32:43] power and then you had to leave the
[1:32:46] automobile but you didn't leave the
[1:32:48] power you added more power to
[1:32:52] but then there come a time we were not
[1:32:55] horse and buggy drivers we were not
[1:32:58] automobile drivers we were not airplan
[1:33:01] Pilots we are
[1:33:04] astronauts we are
[1:33:07] astronauts all the power that was in the
[1:33:10] horse and
[1:33:11] buggy gathered in the
[1:33:14] astronaut what do you saying preacher
[1:33:17] I'm saying all the power that was Luther
[1:33:20] and Wesley and
[1:33:22] Pentecost sced in the
[1:33:25] bride it's an astronaut
[1:33:28] age what he saying I'm saying you don't
[1:33:31] have to settle for nothing
[1:33:33] less you are air to more than a horse
[1:33:36] and
[1:33:38] buggy you are aired to more than a
[1:33:42] car you are aired to more than an
[1:33:45] airplane you are
[1:33:47] astronauts you are air to astronaut
[1:33:50] power
[1:33:51] [Music]
[1:33:53] I just got to say what the prophet
[1:33:55] said he said what did Jesus do he
[1:33:59] suffered without the
[1:34:01] gate now watch this the Bible said that
[1:34:06] he sanctify the
[1:34:08] people with his own
[1:34:10] blood see sanctification comes from the
[1:34:12] Greek
[1:34:14] word
[1:34:15] clean and set aside for
[1:34:19] service now Jesus also suffered without
[1:34:22] the
[1:34:24] gate under the Old Testament or
[1:34:28] Covenant the sacrificial
[1:34:30] Lambs they were burned outside and away
[1:34:34] from the
[1:34:36] camp now this shows how perfectly Jesus
[1:34:41] Christ the
[1:34:43] type and symbol of the Lamb of
[1:34:47] God he died for us that he might SA
[1:34:51] sanctify
[1:34:52] us and set us
[1:34:56] apart he separated us unto
[1:35:00] God now in the Garden of Eden man was
[1:35:04] one with God he separated from the word
[1:35:08] to go with his wife now watch what the
[1:35:11] prophet said he got out of God's
[1:35:15] Camp God's
[1:35:19] fortification his word
[1:35:22] God's Camp God's
[1:35:25] fortification is stay with the
[1:35:28] word now do you realize there's two
[1:35:30] people that's got people on the
[1:35:33] Earth there's two Powers rather that has
[1:35:37] people on the
[1:35:38] Earth Satan has people and God has
[1:35:42] people brother said Satan's taking his
[1:35:44] people the other
[1:35:50] way God is taking his people this other
[1:35:54] way see Satan is taking the people
[1:35:56] beyond the
[1:35:58] camp Camp of
[1:36:00] Reason Camp of common
[1:36:03] sense but Camp of common
[1:36:06] decency see where is Satan taking
[1:36:09] them brother Brooks is taking them into
[1:36:13] a denominational
[1:36:15] Camp come on he's taking them in a
[1:36:19] denominational camp
[1:36:22] and Jesus said let every man's word be
[1:36:27] alive for Earth shall pass away but my
[1:36:32] word shall never pass
[1:36:34] away so you see they go be on the camp
[1:36:39] of God's word to find their
[1:36:43] answer when he persuaded them from the
[1:36:45] camp of God's
[1:36:47] word like he in the garden
[1:36:52] Satan has done the same thing
[1:36:54] today but said people are persuaded in
[1:36:56] their dogmas and Creeds without the
[1:37:00] camp so they leave the camp of the
[1:37:03] word and move to the camp of dogma and
[1:37:08] Creed which the Creed puts him in the
[1:37:12] camp now can I just say what the prophet
[1:37:14] say and the devil's Camp is the camp of
[1:37:19] Education the
[1:37:24] doctor's degree
[1:37:26] educational
[1:37:28] personality
[1:37:30] personality everything that's against
[1:37:32] God's word
[1:37:35] count now it don't take much to realized
[1:37:37] that several years ago there was a
[1:37:41] Holocaust there was innocent
[1:37:44] Jews put in train carts and rode into
[1:37:48] camps they were working in concent ation
[1:37:52] camps
[1:37:56] under a man named Hitler they were
[1:37:59] working laboring under his
[1:38:02] ego in a concentration
[1:38:05] camp now don't
[1:38:07] get but we've had some of those around
[1:38:10] the
[1:38:11] message they taken their
[1:38:14] personalities they put you with her
[1:38:18] personalities they put you in a train
[1:38:20] carart rolled you into concentration
[1:38:23] camps and you worked under this man's
[1:38:25] idea you worked under this man's
[1:38:27] Direction this man said this
[1:38:31] that but I say come back to the camp of
[1:38:35] God
[1:38:37] of of
[1:38:39] Person of a bishop Bop come back to the
[1:38:44] camp of
[1:38:46] God's where the presence of
[1:38:50] godsen you lost your mind no I hav you
[1:38:55] know how God delivered
[1:38:57] Israel Israel was in a man's
[1:39:00] Camp their leader was in a man's
[1:39:03] Camp Pharaoh's
[1:39:06] Camp Pillar of Fire come
[1:39:09] down the pillar of fire come
[1:39:12] down
[1:39:14] Moses god met Moses by the way of the
[1:39:16] pillar of
[1:39:19] fire and the pillar
[1:39:21] fire delivered Moses from Pharaoh's
[1:39:26] Camp are you ready for this Moses
[1:39:29] settled down to just be a sheep H
[1:39:32] herder but the pillar of fire
[1:39:35] appear and when the pillar of fire here
[1:39:38] it was an announcement there's more to
[1:39:41] your life there's more to your life
[1:39:45] there's a commission upon your life will
[1:39:47] Church to the Living
[1:39:49] God William ad was born in a long
[1:39:54] cabin not in a nice
[1:39:57] Hospital a fire show
[1:40:00] up at 9 years old he was packing water
[1:40:04] to a moonshine
[1:40:06] steel are y'all hearing me he was
[1:40:09] packing water to a moonshine
[1:40:13] steel he wasn't on his way to Bible
[1:40:16] College family Lage was against
[1:40:19] him the family
[1:40:22] lineage had put limitations on
[1:40:26] it but when the pillar of fire
[1:40:29] appeared the pillar of Fire released him
[1:40:33] from the
[1:40:34] limitations and separated him unto God
[1:40:37] as a
[1:40:40] Nazarite and Moses ran into the mud
[1:40:42] pitch of
[1:40:44] Egypt and announced we're leaving
[1:40:47] here we're leaving
[1:40:49] here and they received the
[1:40:52] message through the prophet whom the
[1:40:56] pillar of fire had appeared
[1:40:58] to in other words the pillar of fire met
[1:41:03] Moses Moses went to Israel and through a
[1:41:07] prophet P of fire come into Israel and
[1:41:11] they had settled
[1:41:12] down this is the way it'll be we'll
[1:41:16] always be like we'll always be
[1:41:19] slaves I'm going to get to in the
[1:41:21] morning I'm going to get to it in the
[1:41:23] morning but there was a
[1:41:26] vision over their life so when they had
[1:41:30] settled down and said we've gone as far
[1:41:33] as we can
[1:41:34] go a Vindicated Prophet by the pillar of
[1:41:37] fire show up and said leave it here when
[1:41:42] the pillar of fire
[1:41:44] appeared renewed their faith in the
[1:41:47] vision and they got up out of their
[1:41:49] condition
[1:41:51] they dusted themselves
[1:41:53] off they begin to eat the lamb they went
[1:41:57] into
[1:42:01] Passover
[1:42:04] your church Living God I think we ought
[1:42:08] to
[1:42:09] salute return the pillar of power
[1:42:14] came and set your air to
[1:42:17] more to more than just a career
[1:42:21] more than just a bank
[1:42:23] account your name is on the Lamb's Book
[1:42:27] of there from the the foundation of the
[1:42:31] world there's a commission upon your
[1:42:34] life geta in your hand there's a
[1:42:38] revelation and you are the
[1:42:41] beneficiaries of the
[1:42:43] Revelation Jesus Christ it called you
[1:42:46] out of sin called you out
[1:42:49] ofl out of Corr change your
[1:42:54] nature Oh Glory to God hallelujah I'm
[1:42:58] talking about the
[1:43:01] supernatural I said the
[1:43:03] supernatural has returned to the
[1:43:06] church and God is once again taking his
[1:43:11] people out of the
[1:43:13] limitations of
[1:43:15] religion of the
[1:43:16] limitations from the word to the
[1:43:19] church
[1:43:22] but in the end time the prophet said see
[1:43:25] he cannot stay where people are Tau out
[1:43:28] of this
[1:43:31] word now what taught him out of this
[1:43:34] word was
[1:43:36] tradition the prophet said God came on
[1:43:39] the
[1:43:40] scene he walked among
[1:43:42] them but their
[1:43:45] Tradition now now can we can we put the
[1:43:47] preaching gloves on and preach a second
[1:43:49] their tradition
[1:43:52] had so took his place among
[1:43:54] them that he was a stranger to
[1:43:58] them the tradition of the
[1:44:01] fathers the washing pants the way they
[1:44:04] groom their hair the way they groom
[1:44:06] their
[1:44:07] hair the certain buttons on their
[1:44:10] coat may you found it never mind I
[1:44:12] didn't send it to you sorry the
[1:44:14] certainly priest
[1:44:17] rues one was a
[1:44:19] Pharisee one was a
[1:44:22] sad and all that had taken the place of
[1:44:25] the word among those
[1:44:27] men when God visited them he was a
[1:44:31] foreigner he was a
[1:44:34] stranger said may I say this with love
[1:44:36] and respect but to drive it
[1:44:39] home it's the same thing
[1:44:42] today it hasn't change the bit when he
[1:44:45] comes among the people in his power and
[1:44:49] manifestation to prove that he is the
[1:44:52] word the same yesterday today
[1:44:55] and the people says be
[1:44:58] El fortune teller now can I preach to
[1:45:02] you can I say something traditional
[1:45:07] teaching from the
[1:45:09] word has literally
[1:45:12] crucified the effect of the word of
[1:45:15] God in the Church of the Living
[1:45:17] God Jesus said you made the word of
[1:45:22] God none effect through your
[1:45:26] tradition which he have
[1:45:28] delivered and many such things do
[1:45:32] ye look at this word effect the word
[1:45:35] effect means to deprive of force and
[1:45:41] Authority so the word comes in the
[1:45:44] church but the
[1:45:46] Traditions are so in
[1:45:49] place word wants to manifest its
[1:45:52] Authority the fire must to manifest its
[1:45:57] Force TR has crucified the effect you
[1:46:01] know what I say I say crucify the
[1:46:06] tradition Resurrect The Authority of the
[1:46:09] word Living God brother said they
[1:46:13] desired a denomination
[1:46:17] tradition in the stad of the true word
[1:46:20] being
[1:46:21] manest and proven that it's
[1:46:24] right now watch a prophet prove that
[1:46:27] it's God amongst the
[1:46:30] People by science through
[1:46:34] pictures by science through pictures a
[1:46:40] light a light I want to say this brother
[1:46:44] Brooks I thank you for having that
[1:46:47] picture in the
[1:46:49] church it's not an easy thing to stand
[1:46:51] with that
[1:46:53] picture we thank you a pastor is not
[1:46:58] ashamed of the light that has returned
[1:47:01] in this age I tell you why people's got
[1:47:04] a problem with that
[1:47:06] picture got a problem with that picture
[1:47:09] because there's a man in it but you know
[1:47:12] the problem
[1:47:13] is STO at the
[1:47:15] man they need to raise their thinking
[1:47:18] high they need to get the mind of Christ
[1:47:22] mind of Christ will move their thinking
[1:47:25] from the man to the
[1:47:28] Vindication the of God back in the
[1:47:32] church the same one that lived in the
[1:47:36] body of Jesus Christ has come upon the
[1:47:39] people in the last days can I say this
[1:47:43] to you I am not looking for the pillar
[1:47:46] of fire I'm looking at the pillar of
[1:47:49] Fire
[1:47:51] it's more than a picture it's a fire
[1:47:55] that it's shut up in our
[1:47:57] BS science took the
[1:48:00] picture oh the church has seen its
[1:48:03] Works they think it's a
[1:48:06] tradition but I'll say what a prophet
[1:48:08] said he said Jesus the word came on the
[1:48:11] scene F to their
[1:48:14] own he was a fugitive to his
[1:48:18] own but way down deep in their heart
[1:48:21] they know who he was for Nicodemus
[1:48:24] plainly
[1:48:26] stated why didn't they confess him
[1:48:29] being now we identify
[1:48:32] Traditions can we preach a minute
[1:48:35] because they're Camp had set its
[1:48:39] boundary are you ready for this it
[1:48:42] wouldn't let him in the
[1:48:44] camp so the
[1:48:46] tradition set the boundary and they
[1:48:49] wouldn't let go in the
[1:48:51] camp and those that was in the camp they
[1:48:55] wouldn't let anybody go out to
[1:48:57] him see but when he came on the
[1:49:01] scene he was a breaker of their
[1:49:04] tradition he was Center of their
[1:49:08] churches he said there's only one place
[1:49:10] that man can get
[1:49:12] along that's under the shed
[1:49:16] blood and the blood was shed as a germ
[1:49:18] of life
[1:49:20] to gerze the
[1:49:24] seed in other words Jesus was a breaker
[1:49:26] of the
[1:49:28] tradition me prove it to you they're at
[1:49:32] the Feast of
[1:49:33] Passover and they got kosher in their
[1:49:38] hand the kosher bread in their hand
[1:49:41] which is in
[1:49:43] commemoration of what fell in the
[1:49:46] wilderness and brother Brooks they were
[1:49:48] drinking from a fountain
[1:49:51] that was representing the rock that was
[1:49:53] in the
[1:49:54] wilderness so here they are the kosher
[1:49:57] in their
[1:49:58] hand some symbol of a
[1:50:01] rock and Jesus Walks right amongst them
[1:50:04] and says I am the bread of
[1:50:07] life he cried out right in the
[1:50:11] midst he broke their
[1:50:14] tradition where once it was a blessed
[1:50:17] symbol become a in
[1:50:22] Tradition now you all know I'm in
[1:50:24] Revelation 19 when he comes he's going
[1:50:28] to be called the word of God he's going
[1:50:31] to come riding upon a white
[1:50:34] horse and the followers of heaven will
[1:50:36] be behind
[1:50:39] him can I have some Liberty CU we've had
[1:50:42] a lot of
[1:50:44] personalities people Plum scared to
[1:50:46] preach about a wild
[1:50:49] horse taken a beautiful
[1:50:52] Revelation made an ungodly tradition out
[1:50:54] of it and they' got brother coming back
[1:50:58] flying in an airplane set up a tent
[1:51:01] riding a horse yall know I'm telling the
[1:51:04] truth but there's a reason why the devil
[1:51:07] done that it's because of the one who
[1:51:09] was on the
[1:51:11] horse the one who was on the horse was
[1:51:13] the word of
[1:51:15] God and the prophet said he was the
[1:51:18] breaker of tradition
[1:51:20] so if the devil can put a tradition
[1:51:23] between you and the word of God there's
[1:51:26] no authority to break the
[1:51:28] tradition when the veil of tradition is
[1:51:32] gone the veil of pride is
[1:51:35] gone you will see that he broke through
[1:51:38] the old
[1:51:40] tradition you will see him standing
[1:51:42] there the mighty
[1:51:45] conqueror the Word of Promise for this
[1:51:48] age church of living God

[1:52:50] God unconquered by
[1:52:54] tradition brother Brooks he's
[1:52:56] unconquered by
[1:52:59] Traditions can I say it Traditions are
[1:53:03] barriers which become
[1:53:05] limitations you want to help me preach
[1:53:08] look at somebody next to you and say
[1:53:11] they got to be
[1:53:13] broke they got to be

[1:53:20] they've got to be
[1:53:21] conquered Traditions has got to be
[1:53:25] broke you know what if you can break the
[1:53:28] tradition you will break the sound
[1:53:31] barrier and there will come an unlimited
[1:53:34] power there will come an unlimited
[1:53:38] anointing when we go beyond our own
[1:53:40] sound
[1:53:42] barrier I'm sorry I'm going a little
[1:53:44] long but it's here listen the church has
[1:53:46] a sound
[1:53:48] barrier church has a sound barrier and
[1:53:51] it's got to be broken but do you realize
[1:53:54] you can be in a
[1:53:56] church where the sound barrier is broken
[1:53:58] over the
[1:54:01] church and you still be
[1:54:04] bound because brother brandom said you
[1:54:07] got to break your own
[1:54:10] sound the word of God has coner the
[1:54:15] tradition of
[1:54:17] blinding of the blinding
[1:54:21] but you can be sitting there and the
[1:54:24] word saying you
[1:54:28] can't the word saying you can't do this
[1:54:32] you can't go here you can't be a part of
[1:54:34] that and your own sound has got you so
[1:54:39] bound that you believe I can do this I
[1:54:42] can be a part of this and still make the
[1:54:45] Rapture or on the other hand you're
[1:54:49] sound
[1:54:50] can be hearing the word
[1:54:53] say you can you can but your own sound
[1:54:57] barrier is saying you can't you can't
[1:55:01] but can I put my foot on the head of
[1:55:03] that devil
[1:55:04] tonight the word says you
[1:55:08] can the word has broke the
[1:55:11] tradition I say the barrier of fear is
[1:55:15] broken of Doubt is
[1:55:18] broken is brok the barrier of sound is
[1:55:23] broken y'all know what a barrier

[2:04:11] onlooker he want to take an active
[2:04:16] part I'll leave you this testimony
[2:04:19] I believe this is a third pool
[2:04:22] Revival see you're looking at one
[2:04:24] preacher that believes the third pool is
[2:04:25] more than a
[2:04:27] cliche I believe it is the opening of
[2:04:29] the
[2:04:30] word the return of the power of Jesus
[2:04:34] Christ the spoken
[2:04:36] word about two years ago two or three
[2:04:39] years
[2:04:39] ago I went up to Cloverdale to brother
[2:04:42] bcll for their Winter
[2:04:44] Camp I didn't know anybody up there and
[2:04:47] I met brother Murphy wall
[2:04:50] brother Murphy he introduced me to his
[2:04:51] daughter and son-in-law
[2:04:55] and I didn't know none of their
[2:04:58] story I'm just in the pulit preaching
[2:05:00] away on that Wednesday
[2:05:02] night I got to talking about them
[2:05:04] squirrels being
[2:05:05] created know the
[2:05:07] story the squirrel brother said like
[2:05:10] this he said there was nothing but what
[2:05:12] was spoken was come into
[2:05:15] existence by the spoken word just made a
[2:05:19] simple
[2:05:20] illustration I said he didn't come down
[2:05:23] and find some squirrel guts squirrel
[2:05:25] blood squir
[2:05:29] DNA and move his hand across it and say
[2:05:33] abracadabra
[2:05:36] abrao magic it was not magic and he say
[2:05:41] I make a squirrel out of
[2:05:43] you there was nothing laying
[2:05:47] there whatever was in those squirrels
[2:05:50] was purely spoken
[2:05:53] word and when when when I said that I
[2:05:56] said God can do that here
[2:05:58] tonight I go back the next
[2:06:01] year and brother Murphy comes and
[2:06:05] testifies he says brother Andrew he says
[2:06:08] I want you to meet my daughter so she
[2:06:10] stands there her son her son-in-law
[2:06:12] standing there she said brother Andrew
[2:06:14] she said when you were preaching last
[2:06:17] year talking about that third pool she
[2:06:21] said you said that the there was nothing
[2:06:22] there come existence come
[2:06:25] existence she said I've been to the
[2:06:27] doctor and the doctor told me that I was
[2:06:30] missing an organ in my
[2:06:32] body to have a
[2:06:34] child the doctor said without a surgery
[2:06:38] it is impossible for you to have a
[2:06:40] child she said in
[2:06:43] 2019 I went to our summer camp she said
[2:06:47] brother Ron Spencer
[2:06:49] he had a vision and said you're going to
[2:06:51] have that
[2:06:52] child she said so I settle
[2:06:54] down to believe that by the vision and
[2:06:59] the surgery that was the way I would
[2:07:01] have the child she said when you were
[2:07:04] preaching something moved
[2:07:06] over she said you didn't know nothing
[2:07:08] about it and I sure did and she said I
[2:07:10] believed if God could create
[2:07:12] squirrel he could create something in my
[2:07:16] body child
[2:07:19] rightall she said the next morning I
[2:07:21] went home and she said when I come to
[2:07:23] Camp last year she said the morning we
[2:07:26] left for Camp I had a positive pregnancy
[2:07:32] test she
[2:07:34] turns and says here's the
[2:07:36] baby without the
[2:07:39] surgery are y'all hearing me it's not a
[2:07:43] man it's the word have an effect in the
