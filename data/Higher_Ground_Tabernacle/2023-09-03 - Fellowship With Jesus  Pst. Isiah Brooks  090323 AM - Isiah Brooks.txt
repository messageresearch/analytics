Roger maybe I get carried away but I get carried away Hallelujah by the spirit of God you say brother books that's emotional we did foreign [Music] God is so good to us how many people were here last week we were dealing with the uh sacrifice of job I'm sorry Enoch the blood sacrifice of Enoch knowing how free we are um amen show us that uh those who are chosen and elected when God brings you and bring you to the power of the Holy ghosts [Applause] Hallelujah death can't hold this body glory to God Roger Job 38 please we got to read the third and fourth verse of job the problem is many of us we need the holy ghosts and I don't care if you don't like that statements shall we need a soul salvation zombies because when he's in your soul whether it's raining outside it doesn't matter if there's fire outside Hallelujah that Soul does not change what's in your soul it's either God this is what drew or the devil and if the devil is in here you need to kick him out and receive the Holy Ghost I know the message brother Adam said there's a mental conception this morning hallelujah amen it's Rapture time of Jesus Christ to be about her father's business hallelujah amen this this this this um atmosphere I said atmosphere that we bring in here hallelujah is that right in the presence of the Lord in the presence of the Lord outside you ought to respect God better than that foreign job 38. if you are tired tell God about it I have no idea how many times church just weary and tired [Music] but still Hallelujah he touches me he has been faithful you like the fidelo Diablo Hallelujah job 38.3 through four verses like a man for I will demand of thee and answer and answer thou me sent Iran um where was thou when I laid the foundation of the Earth declare it if thou has understanding hallelujah amen we're going to pray pray with us father God we come before you we thank you for the reading of your word we still under the anointing of perfection is glory Lord God and we say this morning amen [Music] amen amen you may be seated Hallelujah you have the problem we're sounding good to me okay no worries I don't care I kind of like this because uh it kind of put me in bondage I can't walk down the aisles God is so good to us we have been speaking on the revelation of perfection because Enoch's revelation of perfection was not by his works his Perfection came by faith his Perfection came by faith because the Bible According to Hebrew says by faith Enoch was translated it wasn't by works but it was by elections see because election brings Faith elections bring Perfection but we have spent so many years in this message trying to perfect ourselves and there is no way you can do it Perfection only comes by God even the prophet of God that when the when the Rapture take place you'll be just as evil as you ever been Hallelujah but it's the answer [Music] Hallelujah that the revelation of this message puts us in a different category is not him that willeth nor he that run it possibly cool but it's God who shows Mercy Hallelujah let me say it like this inspiration is coming all of your righteousness unto the Lord is as filthy rags the Holy Ghost is he if he's not the one producing your righteousness your righteousness is of no value it is the Holy Ghost who sanctifies you it is a holy ghost that justifies you it is a holy ghost that cleanses you it is a holy ghost that perfects you God don't need your help foreign [Music] how Abraham knew that he was Voyager God had revealed to Abraham the the power of his uh how could I say it his faith Abraham journeyed with God he learned of God hallelujah but one day Abraham fell asleep and God began to unfold to Abraham I called you Abraham and the Covenant in which I have made with you it's unconditional Abraham it's not that I'm going to save you but I have saved you and there is nothing that can change my mind of whatever what I've chosen to do is that right Abraham made mistakes [Music] so in between brother Brown said the bride has the ability between the lines Hallelujah that all of Abraham's mistakes was erased Hallelujah everything he did wrong Hallelujah and brother Brandon said it like this Abraham God deals with Abraham's seeds if he erased Abraham's mistakes you'll be Abraham all of your mistakes y'all better hear what I'm saying the grace of God this is why the devil don't want you to get the Holy Ghost if you have religion doesn't care if you Sanctified he doesn't care if you're Justified he doesn't want you with the real Holy Ghost because once you get the real Holy Ghost the ceiling of the Holy Ghost s cannot be broken until you reach your destiny so God took Abraham and put him to sleep like listen to The Prophet's words Israel in the church israeliers number one we're going to start reading at the 92nd verse paragraphs Jesus bled and died for me I want you to take this personally he tore the soul of his own son separated a covenant and he throw the body into the ground it laid there for three days and nights it rolls up for it was not possible that my Holy One good monster shall see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell his soul in hell and brother Brandon said it like this when he rose Hallelujah I'ma show you something Hallelujah by the grace of God you might know it already [Music] his soul is his spirit it's only and he rolls down he's to Liverpool God did and picked up his body and gave him life and he took the body of Jesus and set it at his right hand in glory sit back the Holy Ghost as a covenant there you are don't fall thought of that brother the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're lost hallelujah hallelujah that's that's the only you you won't have to worry about getting it to Heaven nothing in here Supernatural the doors cannot unlock you walk there and bump your head against it Hallelujah the spirit of God inside God [Music] guys that's right so you already judged just on what you think about Jesus Christ his soul went to God God blessed him and then his soul returned back listen to what's being said then in his soul Sonam returned back in the form of the baptisms by the Holy Ghost you sent this to you not just getting things somebody help me here and if the soul of God [Music] there must be a change somebody help me here man oh God see the Holy Ghost let me let me clean uh it comes back to believe us to sanctify cleans up the Mind clean up the heart leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there and when the Holy Ghost is given out Holy Ghost holy spirit that brought the body of Jesus out of the Grave Hallelujah and that Covenant has your dovetails this is it the Covenant has a dovetail and brothers it's like a Chinese uh laundry ticket Hallelujah it must be the same Sisters You must have been a part of him before Not Just Dance you must be a part of him before Hallelujah and that portion of the Holy Ghost that portion of him that was ripped but in your soul you say well brother Brooks I know I'm a Believer follow Jesus and so did Judas is Judas came short because he wouldn't go to the whole go go get the holy ghosts we're afraid of the Holy Ghost yeah we have allowed these teachers to make us think that the Holy Ghost is something different when the Bible said he changes and as he was yesterday yeah he is today and as he is today he'll be there tomorrow we serve a God that cannot change but let me tell you something when the Holy Ghost gets a hold of you guys [Music] going beyond your flesh when you realize when God strikes that Soul the Bible says out comes a river it's so it's a Living Waters you better hear what I'm saying I'm gonna tell you something in just a moment it has the dovetail the Bible said as Jesus is so are we in this day however he is is the way we supposed to because he says then your spirit we have to be the same kind of a spirit oh it'll miss that place going together yes sir [Music] the promises save for Abraham Abraham not at the promise of God [Music] he was faithful not only just he just in his walk classical he was free my question you didn't let me say it like this this one just comes to see why was the Bloodshed the prophet God says the blood was shed to bring Fellowship Fellowship between you and God hallelujah what are we doing what is it that Satan has have us doing this is your day of fellowships with Elohim with God himself not just in your mind but in your heart and you can feel him you know he's dead Hallelujah without a shadow of doubt you know he's there Hallelujah glory to God my next question do you know him Hallelujah and how many of us know that even when you suffer God is safe oh come on somebody even when things don't go right [Applause] hallelujah amen and you can worship him away Hallelujah is that not what job did praise him [Music] Lord take it away is that right let me say something here difference between salvation Hallelujah and there's a difference between being redeemed when you are redeemed off in the body somebody will help me here there's a difference God save Noah foreign [Music] they'll be outside the city hallelujah oh come on somebody there's a difference when you are redeemed you are elected you have been chosen it's all the foundation came from God Gloria glory to God how can I say it um is that right right was it Anna in the temple out of that generation they were chosen they were elected they were among the Bride of that age but there was a many many who did not make it though they claim to be Believers Hallelujah think about it you worry about oh my God ah God showed me something you don't have to agree with it but when God chose a joke and jobs election to his children Hallelujah his children's his own phone was out there partying they're having a good time even the prophet of God he said now have you noticed he said everything that was taken from job was multiplied he said but when it came to his children all he had was a seven he said what it was they were in heavenly [Applause] this time right here foreign [Music] [Applause] but the Lord showed me something you don't have to accept it I'm taking it Hallelujah because God promised me my children I don't know how he's doing good I don't care how he's going to do it I'm lifting up that token measures I'm putting that life out there y'all better hear me and I believe Hallelujah foreign Hallelujah is that all right is it why yes I believe it's all right Hallelujah glory to God God is so good to us fellowship with Jesus Hallelujah God restored everything job lost his Perfection was his election Hallelujah you love the Lord I'm just trying to tell you something we let the devil beat us out of all everything that's why we don't have no job Hallelujah yes sir you say I believe this message hallelujah how can that be that you really believe it when we know by God's grace What the Lord Has Done in this day how many of y'all know coming out of us that there'll be a lot of people saved but yet not in this message yep amen that's what the Bible says that's what brother Hallelujah but you mevu are of the royal diadems we've heard it too much [Music] oh my God [Music] [Music] the problem he tore that soul out of his own son separated the Covenant he throwed that body into the ground I read that already Hallelujah but then he comes and he gives us the Holy Ghost James accomplishments hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible says that he gave us the Holy Ghost his soul and the thing that I love about this Covenant is that nothing can stop it is that right Abraham lied he was producing a generation of lions that's the truth but God's grace at the time of the Resurrection when Jesus rose from the dead Hallelujah why because of the blood sacrifice and we fail to see when we go through changes Lord I want us and God said okay you want to be like me there's some things that got a beat out of you yeah this shows Hallelujah it took 40 years for God to beat Egypt out of Moses Hallelujah and guess what God did he used Moses wife [Music] y'all still fussing and fighting praise God God gonna bring peace when the both of y'all learn how to yields see that's the problem God trying to work character and you're trying to work against what God is doing Hallelujah [Music] the Bible said in all things Hallelujah everything that goes bad in your life it's not the devil [Music] God bring things on you because you got too much of you God is trying to kill every part of you in order for him to live in you Hallelujah he's gonna do it whether you like it or not he's going to do it you can't run from the prophecy Hallelujah if God has included you into the Bride of Jesus Christ [Music] your child your tribulations you won't be able to escape he did not make a mistake he designed your trials anywhere no other way other than the way he's doing it hey Hallelujah but you got to trust God look at Davido David found himself in many pits but he said one time lord deliver me from this horrible pitch and y'all now who was that set for somebody here today is in a horrible pitch and God said he said Lord deliver me from this horrible pitch Hallelujah y'all understand me and then David writes again he said the Lord delivered me this horrible and he placed my feet he gave me Revelations that was the difference between David and the army of Israel David knew who he was Israel had forgotten they were backsliding amen [Music] Hallelujah I'm looking for miracles Hallelujah the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believes Hallelujah even if I can turn this way I still should be able to see him because they're following me y'all better help me here this morning I'm almost done but see you gotta understand the Bible says that Abraham believed God and was strong either before giving praise to God I love the way brother Brandon described the building of the Ark when people came laughing at Noah how do you know it's gonna rain he said God said something Hallelujah to discourage him he said gospel Hallelujah let me bring it to your day how do you know you're gonna be the hill how do you know you're gonna have the Holy Ghost is that right how do you know you're gonna make a rap god Hallelujah that's what we must learn stand on that word Hallelujah glory to God God Drew he said oh Lord I got somebody that just troubles me all the time you'll never get out of that situation until you love your enemy was enemy hello somebody I want to call his name but I had a situation myself institution with this brother hated me and every time he would never say anything to my face when people were around but when it was just me and him he would say such an evil stuff to me and one time it was so bad I was literally on my knees crying in prayer and I said Lord deliver me from this brother and you know what the Lord said to me you must love him first and I said Lord I can't do it but you can give me the love give me the love I call them to love this brother and I can't even tell you when it happened and I can remember trying to help him and his children and for some reason he got offended and he says I'm leaving I said brother don't leave but then there was one time I was praying that he would leave but God put your love in my heart I didn't even want the man to leave guess what he left why because because you must ask God to give you the grace to do it at the beginning the hope of glory Hallelujah yeah you won't make I'm telling somebody I'm almost I feel him lifting but let me say it like this before the Rapture before there's a changing of your body you won't be blind you won't be crippled you won't have no evil in you you know y'all hear what I'm saying this body is will truly be full of God the only thing that has not been redeemed Hallelujah but the power of God would be so great that they will lock this flesh up in prison y'all hear what I'm saying so I want you to understand how Paul said it in Romans 8 28 and we're almost done near my nose but that's okay Romans 8 28. I got a little short message this evening which I'm excited if the Lord would allow me to preach it see this is oh my God I'm no great preacher but I try to tell the truth you say you should say Hallelujah and we know that all things work together that love God you are called according to his purpose I want you to put yourself in this scripture do you really believe your calling come on people that's not a hard question [Music] come on no no we are faulty and I don't care how holy you think you are trouble maker um I believe you took you take my flesh away from me now I'm perfect that's the way I look at it gets me in trouble all the time Hallelujah for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Bradley I think I think so please conforming is a process you know it doesn't happen overnight but let me say it like this for the translations you'll be right in the place God wants you to be Hallelujah you see we love this world too much and before God could get Israel attention he had to bring persecution amen is that the truth so why people say wow the Mount Zion Showdown is coming he's so far the the most but did you realize that on Mount Carmel uh Jezebel had already killed about 400 how many how many um Jezebel had killed him so depression The Squeeze was already going on before the supernatural showed up Hallelujah you understand that and when the supernatural showed up it was fire yeah Hallelujah is that right he said let the God who answered by fire the Holy Ghost and Fire that's awesome you want to know sacrifice has been accepted you must have an experience these preachers and what they've done is killed and they took that quote the Holy Ghost without Sensations and they made us all methodists now all of us think we got it oh we don't need Sensations because we believe brother Brandon is the prophet people yeah God can't change for you how he started the church it's how he is and like I explained to you speaking when brother Banner spoke of the Holy Ghost without Sensations he just did what Jesus did about adultery he said it happened spiritually first y'all hear what I'm saying the Holy Ghost without Sensations has always been that because there is no sensation in your soul um huh Pentecost could only take the holy ghosts they couldn't cross the veil Sensations and everything but beyond the somebody help me here when the Holy Ghost was like when he the offering was accepted that's why um people say ain't no emotions yes it is hallelujah Hallelujah you love the Lord Hallelujah one more scripture I'll let you go Hallelujah brother Madam says in the message Israel in the church he says now you see man has always tried to save himself different things to be saved bye it felt the shoes but it never has been in the New Testament by any works of our own it's by the grace by Grace that's the only thing that can save you it's the grace of God that ought to put some shots in your shoes Hallelujah because you know we look at this oh we make a mistake I don't know how I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it the grace of God hallelujah we wouldn't be so sad if we understand Hallelujah Romans 8. I'm ending up on this there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus not after the flesh IP for The Law of the spirit of life for excuse me for the law of the spirit of Life In Christ have amazed me free from the law the Lord Hallelujah how many of y'all believe that Hallelujah glory to God Roger let me ask you a question in closing this is how many of you have lived so righteously that you feel like you deserve heaven [Music] raise your hand I got I got a couple of people that fully understood that question because if your life is hid in Christ if your life is hid in Christ you deserve heaven but if your life is not here in Christ you don't deserve Heaven y'all hear what I'm saying because it's not your life it's his life and his life is the only life that deserves heaven can I read one more quote coming from Israel in the church the first place we want to find out this has been the greatest thing that I found wrong Christian people around Christian people throughout the entire world has been a fear they always afraid and then a lot of sickness strikes they afraid many I wonder sometimes now I'm alone with you but now what I'm trying to do tonight in the week is to try to drive that fear away we we we don't realize the freedom that God has already given us because we we still work by this law and we fail to see is by Grace God don't want you to do right because you're afraid of him right because you love him Hallelujah now you you you you would come to me and say well brother Bradham yeah I believe this question now I believe that there's only one way in the world to prove now I couldn't go to somebody uh go I couldn't go by somebody's experience there's one true proof yeah that's God's word now if God's words say certain things then I've got to believe that it is the truth hallelujah now the the problem now the problem with most of us is because we have been so saturated with the law we don't understand Grace
