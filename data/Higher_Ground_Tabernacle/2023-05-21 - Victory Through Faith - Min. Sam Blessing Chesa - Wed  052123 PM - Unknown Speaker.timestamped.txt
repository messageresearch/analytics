[0:15] amen amen that's how real the sense of
[0:18] faith is
[0:22] and in the Bible that we read all the
[0:25] sages of old
[0:29] they pleased God through faith
[0:34] and they were victorious through faith
[0:36] is it a Victorious and the Bible says
[0:39] without faith it is impossible to please
[0:48] you cannot have faith without believing
[0:51] God
[0:53] so faith is real Hello
[0:56] faith is a substance
[0:59] faith is a conduit foreign
[1:12] if you want to go to Walmart at Walmart
[1:17] to go buy bread
[1:19] if you have the money
[1:21] you can say I already have what I want
[1:27] that money is
[1:29] the substance
[1:32] of the bread that you need till like
[1:37] in the house yes
[1:40] because you have the money
[1:43] you can invite people to your house and
[1:45] say come eat breakfast
[1:51] because you know you are holding the
[1:53] evidence of that bread
[1:58] although you haven't put it in the
[2:00] pantry Memphis
[2:02] so when you have faith
[2:05] you are already holding the substance
[2:09] you are holding the evidence
[2:12] of what you are looking for
[2:15] it just hasn't come into
[2:27] amen amen
[2:30] Romans 10 17 says faith comes by hearing
[2:38] and by hearing the word
[2:41] you see that's why Satan tries to
[2:44] distract us many times
[2:47] he doesn't want you to hear the word
[2:51] he doesn't want you to read the words
[2:55] because he knows the moment you hear the
[2:58] word you read the words
[3:03] you are going to have faith
[3:05] and when you have faith you can overcome
[3:08] him
[3:12] foreign
[3:25] so you spend the whole day if you look
[3:27] at your screen time for yourself
[3:32] you'll be surprised
[3:34] I want you to compare your phone screen
[3:36] time and your Bible times
[3:47] that's Satan's device
[3:52] Satan using the device
[3:56] to distract us
[3:59] because he doesn't want you to hear the
[4:01] words
[4:03] amen amen because when you get that
[4:06] Faith as we covered
[4:12] and The Sixth Sense opposes all the
[4:14] other five cents
[4:16] suppose that two results
[4:31] that's why we need to read the words
[4:35] that's why we need to listen to the
[4:37] words
[4:38] because without faith you cannot please
[4:45] let's go to our second Peter chapter one
[4:47] and verse five and Riley don't leave all
[4:49] the dirt piano
[4:52] many times we struggle we try and find
[4:55] out how can we have faith
[4:57] [Music]
[5:00] but in here second Peter chapter one
[5:04] verse 5 says
[5:07] and besides this giving all diligence
[5:10] add to your faith virtue foreign
[5:50] it does not say add Faith Sandeep
[5:54] it says to Faith said
[5:57] all the other things
[6:01] so faith is already there
[6:05] amen amen amen if you can you just need
[6:09] to understand how you're reading Davis
[6:10] used to compound the Commodities add to
[6:14] your faith virtue
[6:16] and you see all the other virtues are
[6:18] added to it
[6:21] so faith is already given to you hello
[6:25] God has given it to you beautiful like
[6:28] this is the prophet of God says you can
[6:30] only have faith as God gives you the
[6:32] prophet
[6:37] faith is a gift of God
[6:40] amen amen ever how religious you may be
[6:43] mems
[6:45] you must have faith
[6:48] and your faith can only rest if you're a
[6:50] Christian upon the proven word
[6:55] if you are saved and you have accepted
[6:58] Christ as your savior you have faith I
[7:00] don't see we have acceptations
[7:02] you probably just don't know it is
[7:07] foreign
[7:31] you see
[7:33] those chairs are not trustworthy hello
[7:42] but today when you walked here
[7:45] although you fell before you just tried
[7:48] remember
[7:53] you believed in that chair you quiet
[7:57] how do you have faith in something that
[7:59] has failed you before but you have
[8:01] you're not having faith in God who has
[8:03] never failed come on
[8:10] ever since the beginning God has never
[8:13] failed
[8:15] he has a reputation
[8:19] so when God speaks the words
[8:23] you believe it and you stand on it
[8:27] because he has never failed
[8:31] so I'd rather believe God than believe
[8:33] your
[9:00] [Applause]
[9:32] healing
[9:50] a nature given faith
[9:54] Faith given by Nature
[9:57] there's a nature given virtue yeah
[10:02] nature given Temperance
[10:06] all these virtues they are nature given
[10:10] dude
[10:12] and the biggest part of our faith is
[10:14] mental faith
[10:17] and by hearing the word
[10:21] it brings us to a mental recognition of
[10:24] God
[10:26] but if this coming from above
[10:32] it ever strikes this
[10:35] if this coming from above the word
[10:39] writes this mental Faith Cesar so
[10:42] connect I've exit for a mountain then
[10:44] you have a Godly spiritual faith
[10:49] and what does that Faith do
[10:52] Faith recognizes only the words
[10:56] no matter what anything else says
[11:03] because in the beginning was the words
[11:10] the prophet he explains how we have
[11:13] faith the prophet is available the
[11:16] nature given faith that you use to come
[11:18] sit on a chair without checking it
[11:26] you take the word of God
[11:29] apply it to that nature given Faith yeah
[11:35] it becomes a Godly spiritual face
[11:41] you already have it Allah
[11:44] hallelujah hallelujah when you have
[11:47] God's faith
[11:48] when you apply the word of God to that
[11:51] nature given Faith
[11:55] you are able to change your language
[11:59] from impossible you see this is possible
[12:04] you'll be able to say not not that I
[12:07] think so
[12:10] but you can say I know
[12:13] because you're standing on the unfailing
[12:16] word
[12:19] God who has never failed
[12:22] look at Joshua and Caleb
[12:25] when they went in to go spy the land
[12:30] they sold the Giants
[12:32] but they said I don't care how the
[12:35] Giants
[12:39] simply because the word of God says the
[12:42] land is mine
[12:45] yeah
[12:49] I don't care what my eyesight is telling
[12:51] me
[12:52] [Music]
[12:55] I don't care what my feelings are
[12:57] telling me
[12:59] my feelings might be telling me to get
[13:01] scared
[13:05] but because the word of God says the
[13:08] land is
[13:13] [Applause]
[13:16] supposed to go by there a sight of faith
[13:19] and on his own days
[13:26] amen amen and they were able to to bring
[13:29] a good report
[13:33] all the other 10 spots were ready to
[13:35] amen
[13:57] [Applause]
[14:04] all by faith to Scientific powerful
[14:07] poses and Corinthians will live by faith
[14:10] don't leave the conscience
[14:13] because your eyesight will always tell
[14:15] you what's not possible
[14:19] your five senses always tell you what's
[14:22] impossible
[14:25] what you cannot do
[14:28] but the sense of faith
[14:31] it tells you what you can do with it
[14:35] amen amen the Bible says I can do all
[14:37] things through Christ
[14:40] who gives me strength don't laugh up why
[14:43] it's through history
[14:50] it will happen
[14:52] it doesn't matter how long it will take
[14:55] I know it will happen anyway you're sick
[14:58] because I was surpassing Isaiah 55.
[15:02] when God speaks a word
[15:06] [Applause]
[15:43] that's Faith Holding On Foreign
[16:04] foreign
[16:19] [Applause]
[17:04] young again
[17:07] Sarah didn't have to do anything for her
[17:13] all she just had to do was believe the
[17:15] word
[17:17] you have faith
[17:22] when God gives you a word
[17:25] take that word and go ahead
[17:29] amen amen you believe it
[17:32] say it out again
[17:34] say it out again whatever God's word
[17:38] says about you you say it out again
[17:42] Revelation 10 8 says the bride has a
[17:45] Ministry
[17:49] and the ministry of the Bride is to
[17:52] prophesy again
[17:56] means again
[18:03] is that again in French yeah
[18:07] again means uh prophesy again means to
[18:10] redo it is
[18:14] so it means you're repeating what's
[18:16] already been said
[18:20] that's the ministry of the Bride
[18:23] whatever God says you repeat it
[18:26] because the word of God is the word of
[18:29] prophecies
[18:32] prophesied that word again
[18:35] it's not your duty to see how it's going
[18:38] to come to the world
[18:41] if the word of God says it is finished
[18:45] you can stand up and prophesy again and
[18:48] say it is finished
[18:51] because it's God will say that I'm just
[18:55] repeating it
[18:56] I'm just prophesied
[18:59] man amen so that word he says it is
[19:02] finished 2000 years
[19:49] now Joshua and all of this knowing that
[19:51] the command was great
[19:53] session
[19:56] Assurance he could be Fearless
[20:02] he could be as would call it Reckless
[20:06] foreign
[20:51] Reckless means you are careless of the
[20:55] consequences
[21:00] so because it's God who said it
[21:03] I'm not the one who's going to deal with
[21:06] the blowback of the consequences
[21:10] that's why I can be reckless in faith
[21:15] and go forward
[21:19] God is the one who's dealing with us
[21:24] well he said as I was with Moses
[21:28] I'll be with you I'll not fail you not
[21:31] forsake
[21:34] he never forsaken Moses
[21:37] he never failed Moses
[21:41] he will not he will not fail Joshua
[21:46] he will not fail us
[21:48] because he will be with us
[21:51] when Joshua heard that word
[21:55] that word says is ours with Moses it's
[21:59] the word says as I was with Moses
[22:03] so I'll be with you
[22:06] Joshua remembered everything that
[22:08] happened in the ministry of Moses
[22:15] [Applause]
[22:19] if I eat so that's why he could be
[22:20] fearless and Reckless
[22:24] he was Reckless with the word
[22:28] reckless in faith
[22:31] and they were able to claim each and
[22:33] every inch of ground their feet stabbing
[22:40] because he was trusting in that word
[22:43] is I was with Moses
[22:49] this morning I'm here to tell you
[22:52] God was with Moses
[23:06] as God was with him
[23:08] so is god with us
[23:11] we saw all the success
[23:16] so if he did that through him Allah
[23:37] [Applause]
[24:16] he can do it in 2020 me
[24:31] claim that land hey hey
[24:34] all you just have to do is fight
[24:38] the battle is a fixed fight
[24:43] you are guaranteed to win
[24:47] amen amen it's like an already signed
[24:51] checks
[24:53] that you just have to go fill in an
[24:55] amounts
[24:59] it's already issued out
[25:04] this Bible is full of blanks
[25:12] you you put your name
[25:15] because it's yours the word of God was
[25:19] given to us for us
[25:23] so if you see any promise that is blank
[25:26] without a name
[25:28] you put your name right
[26:01] um
[26:02] an insect
[26:05] a bird right
[26:09] and his friends say what
[26:11] the same as you say called you a buzzard
[26:18] that book called me an eagle
[26:22] so the word of God
[26:25] it just shows you who you are
[26:28] it's like a mirror
[26:31] you stand and you see yourself
[26:35] hey man amen so that's why if you cannot
[26:38] see yourself
[26:43] because it has never failed
[26:46] it will not face
[26:48] and it's still not failing
[26:51] amen amen
[26:53] the prophet of God says the prophet to
[26:55] Judy he says that's a death struck to
[26:58] Satan say say uh
[27:02] when a man takes God and His word
[27:07] that'll kill Satan every time
[27:12] that's the hardest heating Satan can get
[27:17] when a man will take God at his word
[27:21] I like that says that'll kill Satan
[27:24] everything
[27:27] not sometimes
[27:30] not during the day not during the night
[27:38] there's a part that says the word of God
[27:42] will overcome Satan
[27:44] College in any place don't a shark blast
[27:47] any time
[27:49] anywhere
[27:51] why that's the power of the word of God
[28:23] there's never been a time when the when
[28:26] Satan was able to overcome the world yes
[28:33] Jesus with all the power that is
[28:35] invested
[28:37] only the scriptures tell us that God
[28:40] poured all his power into Jesus
[28:46] but with all the power that Jesus had
[28:50] when Satan came to tempt him
[28:54] he did not even use an ounce of those
[28:56] Powers
[28:59] he just used the word
[29:02] when he was tempted when he was hungry
[29:06] he just says the word of God says
[29:09] and every time
[29:11] he overcame
[29:13] every time he had the victory
[29:17] so if you do the same
[29:20] we'll give you the same results
[29:23] whenever Satan comes to tempt you
[29:27] when he speaks to you through your mind
[29:30] say the word back to him
[29:33] it's guaranteed he you will win
[29:38] [Applause]
[29:40] all you have to do have faith in God's
[29:43] word
[29:46] know that it will never fail
[29:50] hey man amen
[29:53] right
[30:22] they were more scientifically advanced
[30:24] than we are today
[30:28] and their science was able to prove that
[30:30] there is no way rain can come from and
[30:33] those shoes
[30:36] I don't think you know I was a
[30:38] scientists
[30:40] and whatever he was saying he definitely
[30:42] looked like he was out of his mind
[30:46] saying something that would never happen
[30:50] but nevertheless he went on saying is
[30:52] going to rain
[30:57] because God said
[30:59] and he did the most ridiculous thing
[31:05] the worst engineering mechanism there is
[31:17] scientific advancements of how to build
[31:19] a ship
[31:20] they may
[31:37] which is like a which is porous it's
[31:40] like a sponge say call man chiffon so
[31:42] when it gets into water it sucks in all
[31:44] the water and it gets heavy these things
[31:53] acting only on God's word
[31:56] she says
[32:03] it doesn't matter how ridiculous what he
[32:06] was doing sounds
[32:09] first of all he's saying something that
[32:12] it never happened
[32:14] it's going to rain
[32:16] second of all is going to build and Ark
[32:19] with something you should never ever
[32:21] build
[32:21] boy
[32:57] desirable
[33:03] and that's and that uh cell sap it would
[33:06] it would overlay this go forward
[33:14] and get into this into the pores
[33:19] and when it hardened a concept of it was
[33:23] strong as steel
[33:27] and it was very light it says
[33:33] they were not seeing this
[33:35] but God in his master plan
[33:38] already orchestrated
[33:44] all the animals would come into the boat
[33:49] I could not sink
[33:53] that says the Lord
[33:57] that says the Lord never fails
[34:02] if God has never and it will not love
[34:05] about the universe
[34:07] so when he speaks the words
[34:13] go ahead and do it anyway
[34:16] we are called to believe not to
[34:18] understand
[34:21] so believe that word and go ahead
[34:25] because we serve our Master pasculus
[34:29] who's the master strategist
[34:32] hey man
[35:11] [Music]
[35:32] you overcome
[36:26] [Music]
[36:31] but at some point in time scientific
[36:59] [Music]
[37:54] his stomach saying no you can't do that
[38:03] I swallowed it back
[38:08] I swallowed it again
[38:10] just kept on until it stayed down
[38:16] you gotta fight your five senses
[38:25] when you get that revelation of the word
[38:28] of God
[38:30] keep on doing it again
[38:33] you will get the victory
[38:36] because when God gives you that
[38:38] Revelation
[38:40] he will never fail
[38:42] he has never failed and why would you
[38:46] start on you hey
[38:48] man amen when you get that Revelation
[38:52] change your vocabulary from impossible
[38:54] to possible
[39:04] and you can speak according to the
[39:07] revelations
[39:11] amen amen faith is contagious
[39:15] someone else faith can trigger your
[39:17] faith
[39:21] your faith can trigger someone else
[39:26] that's what God works in us
[39:29] so people can see that if God did this
[39:32] for me
[39:35] he can do it for you
[39:38] God did it for you he can do it
[39:42] we all know the story of Congressman
[39:46] you do congressmen he was seated in the
[39:50] wheelchair for 66 years
[39:56] and then he heard about Florence
[39:58] Nightingale hello the Florence
[40:01] Nightingale and they had trouble and how
[40:03] the prophet went prayed for her and she
[40:05] got healed come on Florence Nightingale
[40:08] I know I've been sitting at you
[40:10] wheelchair for six years
[40:14] but if God did that for Florence
[40:18] Nightingale why am I so special that he
[40:21] can do it hello
[40:25] and he got the Revelation that God could
[40:27] heal him from someone else's testimony
[40:33] that's why you are supposed to give your
[40:36] testimony
[40:39] for yourself
[40:41] it's for someone else
[40:44] if you get healed give your testimony
[40:48] so that someone else can say that if God
[40:51] did that to you not personally
[41:03] you know the story about those women who
[41:06] lived in the neighborhood we have at
[41:07] least 12 they said
[41:09] and the angel came and healed them a
[41:12] long time
[41:13] the angel had visited the neighborhood
[41:19] amen amen so when someone else in this
[41:22] church
[41:24] that's something for them
[41:32] you can start jumping and shouting
[41:36] I know it's my turn
[41:42] Higher Ground the angel has come in this
[41:44] place
[41:45] if he did it for you he can do it for me
[41:50] don't get jealousy of one another
[41:55] talk because getting jealous you are
[41:57] trying to say God what you did for him
[41:59] you cannot do it
[42:00] at you so that you have people reaching
[42:03] people so when God does something else
[42:05] for someone else foreign
[43:52] thank you for his testimony
[43:58] [Applause]
[44:53] could you foreign
[45:07] the prophet of God says faith is
[45:10] muscular foreign
[45:30] [Applause]
[46:07] that faith will say shut up say foreign
[46:34] all the other five cents to more to to
[46:36] look small
[46:40] because he is the boss
[46:44] he's got big brownie muscles say
[46:47] musculars tell you everything else
[46:51] I'll tell you everything
[46:52] all feelings
[46:55] superstitions
[46:58] just set down when Faith takes off
[47:01] Joseph
[47:06] why Faith that's God's faith
[47:10] oh God operating in you
[47:14] amen amen you may sound crazy when you
[47:17] start talking that I have a sixth sense
[47:21] the other time I think I was in the
[47:24] sixth grade
[47:26] I was in school
[47:29] the ones that I'd heard my dad preaching
[47:31] about faith is the Sixth Sense
[47:35] and the following day in school
[47:39] we had a quiz
[47:43] and the question and one of the quizzes
[47:46] says how many senses does a person have
[47:48] hey
[47:51] foreign
[48:51] is on my quiz and I got it wrong
[48:57] it says no hey the rest of them they
[49:01] have five senses
[49:03] but you are different
[49:05] you have that six times
[49:08] so when you go out there
[49:10] you might not understand
[49:13] because you are different
[49:15] when you are in your workplace
[49:18] you were saying ridiculous things
[49:21] to them
[49:23] why because they have five senses
[49:39] it doesn't matter what your mind is
[49:51] as you do and it is a done deal it's a
[49:53] dance
[49:55] the prophet of God talks about three
[49:57] things
[49:58] he says this is the most uh powerful
[50:01] weapon that God placed
[50:06] at some point he says pray is the most
[50:08] powerful weapon God plays in the house
[50:14] sometimes he says love is the most
[50:16] powerful weapon God plays in there
[50:22] he also talks about confession
[50:25] professing
[50:27] [Music]
[50:29] that your confession is the most
[50:31] powerful weapon that God is
[50:36] confess something through faith
[50:39] when you profess something using Faith
[50:42] [Music]
[50:44] the word says that's the most powerful
[50:47] weapons
[51:15] and you believe and stay with it
[51:20] it says you know what many people look
[51:22] around at symptoms
[51:24] [Music]
[51:26] they say go around they go around and
[51:28] say I don't feel any better it is
[51:31] but your confession has nothing to do
[51:34] with them
[51:36] it's what you believe it's a circuitry
[51:38] not what you feel a bad circuitry for
[51:42] whatever you confess to Faith you
[51:44] confess will bring your whole body into
[51:47] subjections
[51:54] and faith says nothing else but God's
[51:57] word
[52:00] so when you confess based on faith
[52:05] you are professing what you are saying
[52:08] based on what the word of God
[52:11] so whatever you are saying
[52:14] your body has to be subject under it
[52:18] and it has to happen it has to come to
[52:21] pass surprise because it's the word of
[52:24] God
[52:26] amen amen so we receive because we ask
[52:29] not I don't know
[52:32] that's the Bible you receive not because
[52:35] you asked
[52:37] you hey man amen we are scared to bother
[52:42] God
[52:45] says imagine a a mouse
[52:51] it goes into the ghanas of Egypt
[52:55] on Egypt you know in the days when Egypt
[52:58] was a superpower in their heads
[53:03] imagine a mouse goes in there
[53:07] it says I only eat one grain hey
[53:12] because I'll finish everything
[53:14] no that's not it you can never exhaust
[53:18] the promises of God
[54:18] foreign foreign
[54:41] lust
[54:44] is
[54:47] you're asking God so you can you wanna
[54:49] you wanna show off
[54:53] that's not you're not you're not using
[54:56] the faith you're not using God's faith
[54:59] because when you're using God's faith to
[55:01] ask your heart's desires
[55:11] when you are in God's will
[55:14] there is no way you can ask amen
[55:18] so before you ask for your heart's
[55:21] desires
[55:23] make sure you're connected to God
[55:27] when you are asking for God you are
[55:30] asking for the rights
[55:34] and he can supply your heart's desires
[55:38] many times you want to go and we say oh
[55:40] I want to prove them wrong and yeah
[56:46] stop serving him
[56:53] [Music]
[57:01] [Applause]
[57:15] amen so that's why we need to be
[57:18] connected to God
[57:20] and ask him according to his word
[57:24] amen and he will supply our hearts
[57:26] desires
[57:29] hallelujah hallelujah I'll finish off
[57:31] with this quote
