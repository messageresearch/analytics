me ahead of time and read a give this testimony that he would put on the hearts of the song leader that's exactly what he did because we had no arrangement yesterday was a day of culmination where I had biopsies dying on my head and that's why I have the hat to hold my stitches and everything together because I have internal and external stitches the biopsy showed the The Physician that one of two areas that I had cancer and so but he wanted to take tests before we did any removal and so he did he took two tests yesterday and then because that they were switched and what they thought the results were you took two again and so when he came back into the his office the physician assistant came with him and she was crying and and I said to him I said is everything okay and he says yes uh you're totally clean he said there was there was absolutely nothing there he says I I've never seen this before but I I guess we can say that Miracles still do happen here on Earth and so it was

speak through the speaker and hear through the hearer father come and give unction unto your word anoint your word Overlord so that may be made quicken in our hearts in Jesus Christ mighty name I pray believing amen amen let's stand upon our feet and open our Bibles to the Book of Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 11. the Bible reads now Abraham and Sarah are old and was well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I offer sure to Bear a child which am old is there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son amen may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his words might take our seeds amen for a short while this evening I want to speak on is there anything too hard for the Lord Hallelujah we know that there is nothing that's too hard for God he has never ever failed and we know he is not failing and he still will never fail in our lives amen if he did it for Abraham and Sarah he can do it for you and me amen and this word that we read it is God's Own word that he spoke the same words that said let there be light the same person who said let there be light and there was light as the same person who was talking to Abraham amen and the words he told Abraham is is they is anything too hard for the Lord and the answer we all know is no there is nothing that's too hard for the Lord and Abraham and Sarah they've been waiting for his son for oh for 25 years they had been they were almost losing hope Sarah could not believe it anymore as we read it in the Bible Sarah loved one day she heard the man who was talking to Abraham which was God in flesh she did not believe it she said how come he said how is that going to happen to me I'm old my warm is dead there is no way I'm going to be able to conceive and bear a child but God said is there anything that's too hard for the Lord amen it doesn't matter how much hope you are losing just hold on to that word and say father You Did It For My Father Abraham so his promise goes down through from all from all of Abraham's seed down to you so you can take that word and also say is there anything too hard for the Lord in my life hold on to it God will is able to make his word come to pass in your life and this was God came to Abraham and Sarah at a time when they had tried all they could and there was no hope all hope was lost and we know that it's always darkest before Dawn the darkness is most intense just before the sun is about to come out so when you are losing hope when you think you have come to the end of all your wits and you have tried all you can and you feel like this is my worst no that's when your promise is about to come around because it is always darkest before Dawn just before the sun is about to break the Horizon that's when the that's when it's darkest so don't lose hope keep on holding on to this word and know that there is nothing that's too hard for the Lord amen the scripture says weeping may endure for a season but joy comes in the morning it doesn't matter how long your night was it doesn't matter how many years you have been weeping but there is a word that says if you have been weeping throughout the whole night as soon as that Sun starts breaking through Horizon know that your joy is coming amen that's the word of God and the word of God never fails so it does not matter what your night is it does not matter what you are Weeping for just keep on holding and know that as soon as the sun is about to rise Joy is coming your way your weeping is about to end your trial is about to come to an end why God's word never fails whipping may endure for the night but joy always comes in the morning when you are sick and your disease is about to leave that's when it hurts the most that's when you have most pain the prophet of God describes it and talks about how when the germ dies you see a swelling and the pain increases it does not mean that it's getting worse it means that you have you have been already healed you have seen when you are driving on the on the on the road you see a deer that's been hit by a car after three days or so it swells but it's already dead it doesn't mean it's still alive so those germs whatever causes diseases when it's dead it might cause you a lot of pain but that does not mean it's still alive that does not mean it's still afflicting you it means that's the end of it and the prophet of God says don't doubt when it gets worse because when you doubt the life that had left out of this demon the life that it left out of this germ as soon as you doubt and Faith your faith is gone and doubt Creeps in that life comes back in and then you start getting sick again and you lose your healing so brother sister it does not matter what you're going through when you have believed when you have prayed when your healing is coming your way keep on holding on pain might increase but keep on holding on because Joy is coming in the morning that germ is gone hey man so brother sister don't doubt Keep On Believing in God because there is nothing that's too hard for him doesn't matter what you are going through know that all things work together for them that love the Lord it might not look good to you but it is good for you amen it doesn't matter how ugly it might look but just know that the word says all things work together for your good it doesn't matter how bad it is it doesn't matter how painful it is I will keep on trusting God and holding on to his word and say Lord I know whatever you are sending me through is for my girl I might not like the process I might not like what I'm going through but your word says everything works out for my good for them that love the Lord if you love the Lord This Promise applies to you it does not matter how long your trial you've been going through it just know God allowed it it might hurt you might say I'm not able to Bear it but know that God is orchestrating it for your good he is trying to work out something to you it might be like Jonah's plans God is sending you where you don't want to go but you know that God is sending you there for a purpose he wants to show out his glory because everything he does is for His glory it might be like job he takes everything away from you he takes your riches he takes your hope away from you and he takes everything that you hold so dear you might not like it and yes you will not like it but know that it is working out for your good amen if you love the Lord whatever you are going through it's working out for your good amen so you know whatever he sends you away God has permitted it before Satan could touch an afflict job God had to give Satan permission so anything that comes your way know that God has permitted it and he has trusted you knowing that you can overcome it because he can never give you a trial that you cannot handle he cannot give you a disease that you know you cannot pass through it he cannot give you an Affliction he cannot give you a Temptation that he knows you cannot handle so when it comes your way you say Lord I Trust You Lord I Thank you I know you are building character in me I know this trial I know this temptation it is for my good because God is intentional whatever he does he does it for a reason whatever he allows he is doing it for a reason so when he does something he is doing something for you and when he does not do anything he is doing something because God is intentional so when he sits back he is doing something he's allowing you to go through that so he can show forth his power so he can show his glory that's why you gotta trust him God sees when you see to the corner God sees around the corner where you see to the mountain God sees behind the mountain amen because he says I know the plans that I have for you plans for you to prosper so God's plans in your life they are not to destroy you God's plans in your life they are not for you to suffer it might look like you are suffering but God has a greater purpose so you say Lord I know you have a plan for my life I know you are intentional Hallelujah like the singer said we will only understand it better by and by you might not understand why you're going through what you're going through right now but you will understand when you are past it and you look back and you say that was God if I hadn't gone through this I wouldn't have built this character Good Friday was not a good Friday the Friday that Jesus died that was the worst day in human history because everyone all the disciples had lost hope the person whom they thought had come to save him was dead and gone but good Friday only became good after Jesus resurrected when they could look back on Sunday and look back and say that Friday was a good Friday although it was not good for us then but we knew God was working it for a greater purpose Hallelujah so when he died it was the worst thing ever they never expected Jesus to die although he was prophesying it each and every day but he died so you and me could be saved he died for you and me to be healed So Good Friday did not look good on that Friday it only became a good Friday after Sunday so you trial and Temptation does not look good right now it only looks good after you have passed it and you look back and you say Lord I Thank you I know it was you thank you for resurrecting me from that problem thank you for taking me out of that Temptation when I look back I thought this trial was going to kill me but I thank you because it made me stronger now I can trust you now I can believe you because when you went through what you went through you you didn't know anyone to turn to you remember those sleepless nights you had and God seemed like he couldn't hear you at all but when you look back you say Lord I thank you for that because now you trust him more than you did prior to that Temptation prior to that trial now you believe and you can tell and say Lord I know you are a Healer Lord I know you are a savior Lord I know you are a deliverer because when you are past it and look back that's when you can say I understand you will understand it better by and by you might lose a job and don't understand why did I lose my job I'm a Son of God I'm supposed to prosper in this job but you don't know why you lost it you might not understand but just trust in God and say Lord I know you made me lose this job for a reason I trust you later by and by when I look back I'm going to say thank you Lord for making me lose that job because if I hadn't lost that job I wouldn't know that you would give me something better I wouldn't know that you can provide for me I wouldn't know that you wanted to elevate me what you thought was a breakdown after you are through it you will understand you say Lord I thank you that was a breakthrough it looked like a breakdown when you were in it but after you were past it and looked back and see what God has brought you from it you will say thank you for giving me that breakthrough amen what you thought was a rejection what you thought God was not allowing you you look back and you see that it was not a rejection but it was God's redirection he was pointing you and turning you out in a better direction for you because he says I know the plans that I have for you trust him the Bible says consider the Lord in all your ways and he will guide your footsteps so whatever you do be it at your job be it at home be it whatever you do consider the Lord in each and everything you do he will guide your footsteps because he knows the plans that he has for you so you trust him you will see when he takes you out of it amen because Joy comes in the morning amen your blessing is right after that trial you know exams might be tough but after you are done with that exam you are so happy when you see that grade and you will you're not gonna remember how tough that exam was you're just going to rejoice when you look at that certificate you will you won't remember all those sleepless nights you just look at that diploma or degree whatever you have whatever you get after passing through that test and you say it was worth it you look at it and you smile so when you are done through the test that God has sent you through and you see how he has taken you you see how he has healed you you see the blessings he has given you you will look back and you smile at it and you say it was God and you say thank you Lord for taking me through this hey man so every time you go through a trial know that God has a way out for you and you will appreciate it when you look back and see what God has brought you out of so don't disbelieve Keep On Believing Sarah disbelieved what God Said the prophet of God tells us that if it was not because of Abraham God would have killed Sarah because she did not believe God so not believing God will make you lose your blessings the prophet of God says he was speaking about himself he said Satan's been after me all day so I just believe that there is a blessing in store here in this city somewhere and I know when he tempts and tries to block out what's he trying to do he's trying to get you to disbelieve the worst thing you can do is disbelieve God and as soon as you get a little scared well maybe I haven't done this I haven't done that right then Satan's got that blessing conquered for you so every time you see Satan trying to fight you you know that there's a blessing right around the corner there's a blessing right there for you because he's trying to distract you so he doesn't you don't reach that destination so you don't disbelieve God actually when you see that the situation or whatever you're going through is getting worse you know that you're about to arrive there you are about to arrive to your destination you are about to get what you have been praying for amen because Satan starts to try to distract you when you're about to get where you want to go to when you are just out of arm's length of your blessing that's when Satan comes to try and distract you but brother sister Keep On Believing do not lose your focus keep on looking to the promise Giver for he is more than able to do what he said he will do Hallelujah and we read in the book of um in the Book of Genesis we read Abraham God came to Abram and he gave he had given them a promise but Sarah was already disbelieving but Abraham believed that despite it being so long despite the situation of Sarah despite his own situation being sterile in his womb his wife was now barren he didn't look at those circumstances because he know that there is nothing that's too hard for the Lord if God said it then that settles it when God gives a promise he is the one who's responsible to transform you to change you to to condition you for you to receive his promise that he gave in his word so it is not my duty to to know how it's going to happen Abraham was not worried about how their bodies were going to be biologically reversed they just knew there is nothing that's too hard for the Lord he believed on God God said I will have a son so I will have a son God said it that settles it that's the that's how you're supposed to take each and every of God's promise that's the attitude you were supposed to have whenever you see the scriptures that applies to you when you see anything that you need take that attitude and say Lord I don't care how situation how the situation looks I don't care how the circumstances look like I don't know how I'm getting out of this but I know your word is true your word says ask whatever you will in my name you said you will do it so I know you will do it how I don't know I don't care I'm not the one who's doing it so I'm trusting in you anyways because there is nothing that's too hard for you so brother sister don't disbelieve God take him at his word have the right mental attitude to all of his promises and he will make his word come to pass to you he had a confidence with Abraham and he gave the Covenant to Abraham and to all of his seed and all of his see the children of Israel that came after him he had a covenant name he he told him I am Jehovah and Jehovah means becoming or I will be that's all it meant Jehovah it meant I will be so I will be blank that's how he gave it to the children of Israel when Moses asked um at the burning bush and said whom shall I say has sent me when I go back to the children of Israel God told him you say I am have sent you I am what I am blank you fill in the blank whatever you need that's what I am going to become to you so he gave them a covenant name Jehovah Jehovah who meant I becoming or I will be blank which is for you to feel and he had all the seven Redemptive names everything the children of Israel needed he was them for them because that was his Covenant with them and God never breaks his Covenant when he made a covenant with men men always felt that their part but God says this Covenant is all to do with me so I said I will do it I will do it so I am Jehovah to you all the head they just had to go to him whenever they needed him to provide they say Jehovah Jireh whenever they needed healing they would call on Jehovah Rapha whenever they needed him to lead them they would go to Jehovah rohi the Lord my shepherd Jehovah Jireh the Lord my provider whenever they were in battle they needed peace they were called on Jehovah shalom whenever they needed him to be their Banner they called on Jehovah Nissi they called on Jehovah tikenu Jehovah the Lord my righteousness they called him Jehovah shama the Lord who is there for me he was all that for them and if he had that Covenant with Abraham you are a son you are a daughter of Abraham call God on his name and he is able to do it for you amen in the days of Abraham they were in a polyethylstic culture they worshiped many gods there were so many gods they worshiped the son God they were heathens they worshiped idols and God wanted to establish his name that's why he called Abraham out so he can be identified as the god of Abraham when Moses asked them whom shall I say I am he says I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob so he called Abraham out of the land of the heathens and he raised them up so God could be identified with Abraham everything he Abraham did they will say that's the god of Abraham so God wanted to show himself wanted to have his identity through Abraham everything he did for Abraham it came back to him because the Bible tells us that he is a jealousy God he wants all the glory amen so when they would call on the god of Abraham they knew everything that the god of Abraham had all the victories the children of Israel had they would call him the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob the god of Israel and they would see everything the children of Israel had come through and they would attribute that as the characteristics of God so God wants to show himself through you he says after he was after after he resurrected he says I will be even in you till the end of the Earth why is he in you because he wants to show himself through you he wants to be identified when he does a miracle in your life when you are living your holy life God wants to show himself through you you being a reflection of him so God is a jealousy God he is jealousy about his name so when you call on him he knows you're representing him so when you call on him and say Lord I need your help he knows you are his Ambassador so he's going to come through for you amen he's not going to fail you he was Jehovah I will be whatever you need him to be he is that to you this evening Hallelujah but we thank God after the cross of Calvary we know that Jehovah of the Old Testament that's Jesus of the New Testament Hallelujah everything that Jehovah was we know that that's what Jesus is so instead of naming all of the names of Jehovah and all his characteristics Jehovah rohi Jehovah Jared Jehovah Rapha all you just need to do now when you are praying just call on the name of Jesus when you call to say Jesus he is a provider when you call Jesus he is a savior when you call Jesus he is your peace Hallelujah so you call on the name of Jesus he is everything everything that was in God was poured into Jesus so whatever you need call on his name he will be there for you that's why he died on the cross of Calvary so he can be all that to you when he said it is finished he opened it up for you Hallelujah for you to be able to go to the throne of God claim everything that you need claim all your heart's desires claim your victory whatever you're going through just know there is nothing that's too hard for the Lord whenever unit saving call Jesus you need peace call on him because the Bible says there is nothing that's too hard for him he is able to do everything that he said he will do so I will look in the Bible and look at everything he said he will do I know he will do it because he will never fail Jesus is a gentleman he does not force himself on you he will only give you what you ask for he is not going to force this I'm going to give it to you anyhow whether you like it or not I'm going to give you you have to be wanting it for him to give it to you so you get what you are expecting because Jesus is a gentleman he waits for you to ask then when you ask that's when he provides that's why every time when we come to church we have to come expecting whatever you come expecting that's what you come to get if you come to church to criticize you will go back home with a long list of things to criticize because that's what you came expecting but when you come expecting a blessing you will get that blessing when you come expecting God to speak to you you will hear God speak to you because he always gives you what you are expecting he will supply your need that you need so if you need to come here to see everything that's wrong with everyone then you'll see everything that's wrong with everyone but remember when you point one finger the other three are pointing back at you so you have to examine yourself so come expecting the prophet of God says here well I still I see the angel checks his chair he was talking about when uh God came with the two angels and they were speaking to Abraham he says I see the Angel takes his chair leans back towards the tent and Sarah lists listening through the tent you know she was eavesdropping through the tent and she was uh in an awful mood that morning you don't see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood you just no need of trying it you might as well have stayed home you won't get nothing out of it this is the prophet God's speaking says you don't see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood he says Sarah had been in the mood in that morning that's why she doubted the word she didn't believe what God says because of the mood she was in and here the prophet of God says you just don't try it you might as well just have stayed home and you won't get nothing out of it you won't get nothing out of the service when you come expect when you come expecting to see everything that's wrong when you come to church come prayed up come in the atmosphere come expecting so you have to pray when you are coming into church you remember on the day of Pentecost they sold tongues of fire each and everyone had a leak of fire above them so when you come to church the prophet of God tells us you come prayed up so that you come in with that atmosphere you bring your piece of atmosphere he brings his peer of atmosphere the sister brings in has a piece of atmosphere and well then when you come there is an awesome presence in the house of the Lord but why you come to church in a mood you don't even want to come to church whatever vessel you bring that's what fills up when you come with the critical vessel you're gonna go back with that vessel filled up you come to church Moody and you expect everything to go right you just fought at home you were just quarreling and arguing and you don't even pray and you're just coming straight into the chair into the house of God and You're Expecting to have a wonderful time the prophet of God said don't do that don't come to church in that kind of a mood make sure you come pray it up come in that atmosphere come expecting there is no way you're going to be blessed you come in Grumpy you just come in and sit there you fold your hands and you're just looking like you are grading the sermon and you're expecting God to speak to you and you're expecting a blessing that's not going to happen you need to bring your atmosphere you need to come pray it up and you say the song service was boring why because you came with a bad mood you came in Grumpy you were supposed to come and sing for yourself when the song leader is singing here he's he's conducting you to sing he's not singing a special to you you have to come in participate bring in your fire change that mood change that atmosphere remember we are creators we create an atmosphere demons can run out of this church by an atmosphere through the singing of songs demons can get out so you make sure when you come to church come pray it up amen and you probably when you come to church you probably come very late I mean Wednesday is different because we're all coming from work and a lot of different things but on a Sunday at least when you come late at least come pray it up but you come in late as almost you are ready to come and close in a word of Prayer and you're expecting to be blessed it does not work that way coming pray it up bring in your atmosphere Hallelujah Whatever You're Expecting that's what God will give you you're expecting the preacher to to to uh to jerk you up to Jack you into the atmosphere You're Expecting the song leader to take you out of your grumpy mood and put you into the atmosphere and say oh he took me from this to that no you have to pray you have to put an effort because God wants to speak to you there's a song that says put on the Garment of Praise And The Spirit of heaviness will flee away so at least if you are grumpy at least if you're in a bad mood come early so when the songs of Zion are being sung that Spirit of heaviness can flee away and then you can be delivered because in the house of the Lord there is Liberty when you come in here bound you are supposed to be set free the prophet of God says the house of the Lord is supposed to have an atmosphere such that when the sick people walk in they are supposed to get healed without even getting prayed for when someone comes in here with their burden through the singing of songs just the atmosphere and the church they're supposed to feel alleviated why because you brought your atmosphere because you came prayed up because you're expecting God to speak you are expecting God to do a miracle amen so brother sister we need to come expecting God to speak to us and whatever you expect that's what he will give to you Abraham was expecting that Miracle that's why when that word came and God told him is there anything too hard for me he didn't doubt it he just took it straight away but Sarah because he was not expecting it because of the mood she wasn't she doubted this is like there is no way that can happen and God does not like Disobedience to his word the prophet says God could have killed Sarah if it was not for Abraham but if you come expecting God will perform a miracle in your life he will grant you your heart's desire amen he will turn your night into mourning he will give you a dance he will give you Joy it will turn your sorrow into gladness when you come expecting because there is nothing that's too hard for him the right mental attitude to each and every of the God's word will bring all of his promises to come to pass in our lives amen let's turn upon our feet brother sister there is nothing that's too hard for the Lord [Music] if he did it for Abraham he can do it for you and me if he did it for Sarah he can do it for you and me remember Rachel was also barren foreign for Abraham because God needed for Sarah he did it also for Rebecca he did it for a Rachel and he opened up their walls because they believed in him and they believed that there is nothing that's too hard for him I don't know what you were dealing with but I know that God is the same yesterday today and forever he is the same he never changes if he did it before he can do it today brother kids gave his testimony earlier on I was blessed by it the doctor said he had cancer but when they chat they say there is no cancer Hallelujah and the doctor said God is still doing Miracles why because he is the same yesterday today and forever the doctors might say there is no cure for cancer but we have a living testimony right in front of us that God can do The Impossible he can do the things that people say is undoable things that's impossible he can do it amen problems that don't have a solution God will give you that solution why because he is a God who turns impossibilities to possibilities amen he gave Abraham and Sarah a child after waiting for 25 years something that we don't hear of old people getting getting babies that's impossible but God did it so if you have a desire this evening just say Lord I am no different from Sarah I am Abraham's son I was bought by your blood and I know when you said on that cross of Calvary it is finished of Abraham the when you say it is finished all your promises apply to me and I am claiming them because I know you said you are more than able to perform each and everything that you say you hold in your word if that's your prayers worship with me this evening let's sing this song create a clear heart oh Lord [Music] and we know our eyes fever
