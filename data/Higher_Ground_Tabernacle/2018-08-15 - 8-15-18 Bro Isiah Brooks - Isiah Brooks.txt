no more dying death or we are going to see no more dying there we are going oh no more dying there oh we are going to see the Amen Alleluia hallelujah Oh soon and very soon oh we are gonna see the king Oh soon and very soon we are gonna see the king oh soon and very soon we are gonna see the king Amen Alleluia hallelujah we are good all soon and very soon oh we are good all soon and very soon we are gonna see the king oh soon and very soon we are gonna see the Kings hallelujah hallelujah we are gonna see the king soon and very soon we are going to see the king amen trust the Lord all of us will be ready to do that without God where would we be it's so amazing me that there are so many people who don't even believe that God exists the saddest thing about it is it doesn't matter whether we believe it or not he exists there were many people in the days of nor didn't believe it was gonna rain it didn't stop God from making it rain God will make even the the the hardest man or the the atheists believe he's God because the Bible says every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God our Father I am grateful that God's mercy and grace has found us he doesn't have to make us bow we bow because we want to bow we bow because we realize he is God and he deserve all the praise he deserve all the glory as we stand let us turn to Corinthians 1st Corinthians 2:15 chapter the song goes great with with the message surely God is good to us as we read beginning at the fifth eighth verse now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality for so this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord one more scripture and we'll let you be seated 1st Thessalonians the fifth chapter we're going to come from we're gonna read the first 10 verses but of the time and of the seasons you have no need that I write unto you for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh on them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God have not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by a Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we are asleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourself together and edify one another even as also you do let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace father we thank you for your mercy and your love Lord

be gladly will I Turin sofa hallelujah only let me walk with me hallelujah that's all I want close to the Lord close to thee close to thee my subject on tonight would be just that so close to God just didn't want to say close to God I want to be so close to God because that were so in this you cannot describe how greater closeness that is it's just not being closest like so close like God so loved the world it actually puts more to that closeness we realized by God's grace that we are in a time where Satan is fighting and he's bombard in everybody's minds homes jobs you name it the devil is really striking everyone but you know God has given us something of the world just don't know anything about and God intent for these storms that are now rising his intent is to better you and God wants to see a people that has undisturbed faith the kind of faith that no matter what Satan tries to do it will not disturb you because you're so trusting God now we're living in time than we we know the Bible tells us that we ought not to be ignorant of these times because we realize amen that these times is just declaring that the coming of the Lord is close by God said even last week when the brother came as it was in the days of Sodom as it was in the days of Noah and we realized violence was in the land all kinds of things were happening and you and I know that this world has gone completely insane and the only people that has their sanity is those who are Christians yeah well there's a time our country did have a little sense and that's when we truly believed in the principles of the Bible but but but our country have strayed so far away from that they've taken it away taken up our way the Bible out of the school's out of the churches many people don't even carry their Bibles to church anymore but there's a time you know we were Christians were known because they carried their Bibles everywhere where they went now we're living in a time and like I said God said don't be ignorant I'm coming and then in though the devil may see it may seem like he's taking his time he really is because God has an appointed time but in this time you must understand that Jesus Christ died on the cross and he rose again that we may have power authority and you must understand that his whole teeth God the devil could never Amen stop the relationship but because of the breach because of sin he broke the fellowship but now because of the blood we can fellowship with God right we call a Redemption by blood right and fellowship by blood the whole point a man of God dying is to restore back him in his creation with the Creator to star by the creation with their Creator God always he wanted to fellowship and he doesn't this sin will breach you thus in a men would keep you from fellowshiping with God even though God will be with you he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but did you know since there are people who can live so close to God that they have the ability to see things that other people cannot see yeah and sometimes when those people who are living close to God see things people but you see there is a position that you can have with God that God will show you and tell you things that he won't tell others that right you see John one of Jesus disciples was one of those John newfies the other disciples didn't know but God in the flesh of Jesus when when Jesus were to be portrayed betrayed amen Jesus told John who to betray it was none of the others disciples knew it amen and those disciples knew that John was a bosom buddy of Jesus and he said John go find that's what they said to John go see what Jesus who Jesus is talking about gee that's how it is and that's how it will be there be a group of people that will be able to see the coming of the Lord they'll be able to know he meant that he's at hand is that right with that resurrection began there will be a people that will be able to see those raised from the dead everybody won't see it just like in the days of Jesus when Jesus rose from the dead the Bible said the grave will open a meaning that was in the grave rose hallelujah and the Bible said that they were seen by many but everybody didn't see it hallelujah so will it be this resurrection it will be such a people that is so close to God God is going to tell his secret that right remember the time of second Kings assist chapter when Elisha amen was being surrounded by the enemy I believe in Assyrians and here it was gay gays or his servant was so afraid Amen because he said all master they're more him than us and in Elijah's and Lord open up your servants I let him see hallelujah that there are more of us calling is that right remember we are serving not just Jesus Christ he is Lord and He is Lord of hosts hallelujah he's the captain of our salvation you understand me hey man he's our better light he's our sword and shield he's our weapon tree he's I everything but you'll never understand that until you close to him when you with God and you close to God God will tell you and he keeps you straight you know God is the one that keeps the soul you can't keep your soul hallelujah God you're so is that right listen do you know that Enoch knew when he was going to be translated why you say that brother Brooks because he walked with God and he was found not is that right a man he was translated amen listen God God comes to him and he says Enoch today is your name is that right he told him you gonna have a cylinder is that right he said Abraham you're gonna have a son and nobody could see that Abraham would have a son here was Abraham and Sarah 70 or something years old they will all past menopause and everything else and God said you gonna have a son hallelujah one day I believe God said eat up I'm gonna do a new thing with you you gonna be translated the Prophet God said one day he not waived to his family said goodbye hallelujah amen and what happened he man he walked with God is that right and he was found not I believe the bride will know because the Bible said we are not ignorant we're not children of the darkness hallelujah but we're children of the light but in order to see him you've got to be him hallelujah let me say that again in order to see him you've got to be him hallelujah your closeness is not like me next to this dresser you're closed as he said in that day I will being the father the father in me and I in you that is the kind of closeness that will take a rapture by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death what there are some of us came in here tonight that will not see death come one of them hallelujah I believe with all my heart I'm one of them they say you crazy brother most I'm just as crazy as Lazarus was hallelujah levels within the grave for four days and stinking is that right he had to die God raised him up from the dead and he died again hallelujah but this time we'll never die anymore once we are changed it meant from our the so nasty filthy flesh from mortality and mortality hallelujah the Bible said the death will be swallowed up in victory what his victory because he died died because he he was bad when I was buried because he rose I rose hallelujah and Paul was so confident amen in this victory he said own death were sustained whole grain where's your victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not what I can do is what he's done for me hallelujah I can't save myself no more than I can hear myself but I know the Gila I had nosily redeemed my hallelujah I know the man who can change night in the day and day in tonight I'm so bad that a man can live so close to God to the devil don't know what to do with him hallelujah that's right can I get out obey God y'all hear me keep my faith Moses by faith he saw what he saw the promise right while the Egyptians were seeing mud dobbers Moses were seeing the promise Moses was seeing the promise of God you see you can't you gotta live with him you got to be with him you got to know the pillar of fire y'all understanding and so what happened when Moses ran from Egypt as a murderer can you be saying God say the murderer hallelujah if God can save a murderer he can say if God can change a letter he can change me hallelujah but he calls Moses and said take up your shoes because you're standing on holy ground hallelujah see before here Moses wasn't close to God but he still tried to serve God he tried to deliver the children of Israel by his old light by his own strength hallelujah is not that power is not the light but is by the Spirit of the Lord hallelujah and what did God do what God said I have come down I have heard the cry of my people y'all hear me if you cry out to God God will hear you I don't care what circumstances or situation you're in God still can hear hallelujah God heard the crowd as people said I've come down and deliver him hallelujah but I'm gonna sell a preacher I'm gonna send a prophet hallelujah and he's gonna tell you how and what to do hallelujah hey man Moses didn't say I'm the man of the hour but he said I serve a god and his name is I am that's all you know yes I am your bread I am your healer I'm your deliverer I am your Shepherd I am your king is that right I am can be whatever you let I am be to you hallelujah is that right oh come on people I love it when he says I am that means I can feel in the blank with anything hallelujah come on somebody yeah it's by faith he saw the promise and you understand he's taking his way with the laws despise whew right a true Christian don't care about popularity he doesn't care about saying he doesn't care whether everybody likes him or not he is a man who's able to walk alone hallelujah he's and he go hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying amen so he tastes away with his eyes whew and you know what Pharaoh says take all your God and get out of here I don't know what to do with you see what I'm saying moe shook each of so bad Pharaoh didn't know what to do with him hallelujah he couldn't kill him huh he couldn't capture you hallelujah he couldn't fall in jail hallelujah it was a one-man invasion but he lived close to God hallelujah he talked with his father hallelujah and everything his father said knew he did it that's what we need to be that's where we need to be Lord whatever you want me to do I'm willing to do it lujah chief faith will work miracles he's a miracle worker somebody said he did it yesterday I'm telling you he's done it today every day he's a miracle worker hallelujah he wakes me up every morning he gives me sleep every night he keeps my body healed hallelujah that's a miracle worker hallelujah yes sir you look at this thing at all oh that's one thing about him if you stayed true to God by faith you see it if you stayed true to God you will see him hello God will manifest himself to you you won't have to look for him he'll come down to you right Moses wasn't looking for God God came down to him hallelujah is that right was Mary looking for God she was going to the well she was going to get water but Mary was a faithful virgin and God came down her faith produced God hallelujah and when you are faithful in God God will produce himself he'll show you he's the same yesterday today and forever whoo oh my god listen I'm so glad he loved me because he because of him loving me I can love him hallelujah I didn't know what love was until of Cain hallelujah I thought I knew what it was I didn't know what it was to love came a mine it was la who gave me love it's love who gives you love hallelujah love is not something in practice long years God his log did it all of us was wicked every one of us have done shameful things in our past probably God loved me why would God love you because he saw you from the foundation of the world he knew you you were part of him you didn't know it hallelujah when you use in the club and said pass me another drink you didn't know that inside of you was an attribute of God is that right till one day the voice of God found you and the Bible said my sheep hears my voice and astray that they will not follow hallelujah you see what I'm saying thank you heard me say you couldn't be a part of Billy Graham's group you couldn't be a part of all Robert's group because that's not the voice you heard from the beginning hallelujah you heard the great Shepherd hallelujah you heard the voice of the word hallelujah and that word was God and so when you heard that word you didn't understand it but you knew that you could identify with that word because that word identified with you and guess what you look like a hard ball you look like a weirdo hallelujah y'all really believe that yes I believe it and right now I tell you one of these old days you look for me and I'll be gone his love taking it away love is the most powerful force there is he said take a husband that's really love his wife he'll die for her freely brotherly love to is all know that there's not one person in this place that I wouldn't really die for I we mean hiccup God no it's the truth hallelujah I don't care if you good or bad he didn't care if I was gonna bad he still died for me hallelujah only God can give that kind of love mm-hmm that's right and there was a man a certain man come to the church once in a while out in the country was sitting at the brothers house that's right listen and he said what if something would happen to brother bill he said gladly I will stick out my chest to catch a bullet for him would you catch one for me I catch one for you and I saved it with no hypocrisy ah because I cannot die no more than you can die if you love God and you have been born again you have passed from death of the night that's why I don't know why people on the whole all do this world hallelujah Paul said I want to go but I can't go right now Holly Holly and when it was passed him to go he was so close to God in death face o death where is your sting o grave where is your victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah you've got the victory hallelujah Amen when these all are deficient ever causing death I am not dead I just took me another a ride home hallelujah I jumped on a child and I'd be there waiting for the ones coming after me so were you see brother you are crazy I am I guess I am hallelujah this like I tell people where were you before you got here I can tell you where you were first of all you were somewhere else before you got into came into your mama you were somewhere right because if you were somewhere you wouldn't have never come you had to exist somewhere in order to come here hallelujah and because you exist here that means you're going somewhere else this is not the end of it is that right the scripture told Jeremiah said Jeremiah I knew you before he was formed into your mother's womb Oh Israel I want you to know there will be a son isn't it a child a male jabo on his name would be Josiah haha you took my predestination hallelujah he said Mary this thing is in use of the Holy Ghost he shall be the Christ child hallelujah did Isaiah talked about him first yes he did I said his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty God the Prince of Peace hallelujah behold is that right y'all hear what I'm saying and just as they were predestinated so are you yeah right y'all don't believe that that's why I can't help but to love him because before I came here I was born in love huh love and the Bible tells us not there's no greater love than this that a man will lay down his life for his friend or brother is that right that's how you know that you really got the goods right love chosen us in love before the foundation of the world is that right that's why people I came to I love how you can't love if you born again John said God is love so if you born of love that means love begets love how can you not love have you been born again you've been begotten by law for yourself I had a father and his name was love amen every son he had would be loved Oh have him be destinated us predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself is that right he loved you God loves you and this is question-and-answers he loved you before there was a world he knowed your nature who watch this he knowed your weaknesses he knowed your habits he knows all about you what she was going to be and then when he looked over all the great universe as it was he said I choose you well come on Sal on it hallelujah and he pointed to you you you all of you and said I choose you Oh God don't make a mistake who me I was just as bad as Peter Peter was a hot tip of Jews is that right God chosen Matthew the tax collector was a thief God chosen oh can you imagine God that the Lord Jesus Christ follow 12 men following him renegades outcasts the scorm of Israel hallelujah only one had a good reputation his name was Luke he was a physician he had a little something something anyway Amen you look around and then God amen comes along and he shows you it ain't about what you think you are is what he declared that you are hmm is that right oh he loved you he loved you before there was a world he knew your nature he knew your weakness he knew your habits he knew all about you what was you going to be is that right hallelujah in that God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son right and when he did that before there ever was a speck of light then you eternal with God huh his choosing you makes you eternal when you receive the Holy Ghost didn't you become eternal because you was you are you're a god you're with God you're part of God and can you see what I mean is that right you are a part of God when you receive the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is eternal life and it cannot die it is what it is the devil don't like it have preached to do it this way but we need some encouragement hallelujah amen the storm is passing over though it's gonna pass over and as they say and that old song these this too shall pass hallelujah Kate last this way in forever you don't him say listen it is written he said Jesus saying you could deal me saying that I'm the son of God right he said believing it written here gods don't you all all say that now you say what do you mean brother Brooksie we can't make ourselves God gods but when we become part of him we become the children of God we're not the great Elohim but we are all spring according to acts right offspring of God it's like a horse heaven our hearts a cow having a cow a dog having a dog you possess the same characteristics that's why they call them Christians because they act like Christ they walk like Christ supernatural followed them like Christ hallelujah is that all right was like Moses with Moses of God come on that's what the Bible said God said to Moses I'm gonna make you God to Pharaoh hallelujah and he was God to Pharaoh no matter what Pharaoh said he couldn't overcome Moses because God was in Moses it wasn't the flesh and blood of Moses but it was that same pillar fire that was in the burning bush that now stood in Moses hallelujah and that's what we need we need a pillar fire not on the picture we need win the pillar of fire which is God comes down and set within your heart you become part of him he said father I wouldn't be one even as we award close to the Lord that's the kind of closeness hallelujah so close to the God the devil don't know what to do with you hallelujah see you getting up in the morning say oh my god he's getting up again oh yeah and I'm getting up and we're gonna whoop you today like you whip you like we whip you yesterday is that right you can't be afraid of the devil hmm don't you know zone law say that like Moses and like Elijah like those prophets who live so close to God till God just transfer himself right into them huh and they spoke not themselves but God take no thought what you should say cuz this is not you their speech come on that's the kind of closeness God won't not talk to you in your ear but talk to you from your heart you see so in dwell in you then you assault or surrender to him that he can say what he wants to say at any given time but he said don't add to it keep your mouth shut till he speaks another area it's the father that dwelleth in you he do it though speaking his words is not he his words is not his own because his life he's dead in other words your words is not your own you're dead so the words you're speaking is life so therefore when you speak the word when God speaks the word through you it must come to pass well because the word can't come back boy hallelujah if you die you take the blood out of the land and you embalm him trouble of it is a lot of them never been that got him bought you take the blood out of a man he's gone then the only thing you got to do is put another blood back in him and he's going to live again see you took his blood out and see now we'll put the blood of Jesus Christ and see and that brings the faith of Jesus the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ the temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ see he is the head and controls you you see them saying just like we allowed those demons to control us when we was in the world we need Jesus on the inside to control us hallelujah let him do our thinking that into our talking let him do our walking hallelujah we need to let God control us hallelujah yeah man you won't vote you you get Jesus he's a head that controls you your feet is the foundation faith a man controlled by the head takes there is a perfect man of God when he's possessed these bent virtues that's the perfect man when you possess these virtues is that right then God representing this church as a bride a woman God represents his church as a bride and they way and the way he brings each individual to being his son to go in that bride he's all also has brought the bride through these ages is that right till he'll bring this one complete church into hit into into this in other words amen in order to get be bride you got to have these virtuous living in you huh when I see the Blood I pass over you and you and I realized that the blood is no longer natural blood is the Holy Spirit it is the life of Christ living in you that is the token hallelujah Oh close to God if I'm gonna be close to God I gotta be close to my brothers oh is that right he said whereby we are given extremely great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption hallelujah that is in the world through lust is that right God Jesus Christ has so much love in him he loved the devil let me brain saying that he loved Judas Judas was the devil hallelujah don't get me wrong now he only loved you this because Judas was a brother the devil is not your brother all right don't read books save you got to love it ever no no no no the devil is your enemy all right see lust for money lust for big things lust for popularity these things are dead to the believer we don't care a tenth or college why should we care live or die sink or drown this is the thing that I interested in the kingdom of God whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ our hope of glory Yahoo and I'm saying how are you going to be tested jesus said except you love mother father sister brother five children you gotta love me more than you love these and the only way that you'll know that you love God more you will be tested well I stand with the word or will I compromise hey somebody in order to love God hallelujah you will suffer persecution is that right and persecution will come from your own household you don't need to do all of this I must do all of this I don't know nothing else to do I must be God and whether you love me or hate me I'm gonna stand on the word ah my desires to be close to him hallelujah one thing I know about him he'll never fail me he'll never forsake me and I can't even tell you how many times I've put shame to his name but he still loved me anyhow build me up a lot into this let Christ be my head that's working through me oh my foundation my faith that's in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness working me O Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or swim seeker drown denominational dough denomination friend and no friend let that work in me let Christ virtually his knowledge flow out that I might be able to teach those for God has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it that for that perfection of the coming of the Son of God each one of these stones are a material off of the one this is the material of this each of these virtues belong into into him and they're pouring out him down through them hallelujah so you understand don't say you ain't got it or you can't get it when it's pouring out hallelujah if it's pouring out you just gotta find a position hallelujah yeah y'all remember back in the day when we had the Fosters outside we didn't have no cold wallet didn't know what a Frigidaire was we knew what a big buck I swore hallelujah y'all don't know about that but in the day it man you had an ice truck come through the neighborhood but not down south you don't know what I mean the rich people had a lot of things we didn't have for years we get under that you know hot day we get on that faucet and that water be cold we walk out there and I bill is big like that hallelujah we wouldn't stop to the belly was full can we no and go eat over another day and a half and you can't get it this way you got to get down on your knees that's what we had to do we had to get down on our knees to get to that faucet is this okay see we want to be close to him and this the closest that God is he stuck he's not he been with us for a long time that was that was a close as one time do you know through that period you know he was with Moses and with this one and with with Israel but now he wants to be in you that's the closeness he wants he wants to be in you and me hallelujah and if we have that closeness with him we won't have to worry about a resurrection because he is the resurrection that would he told Mary and Martha he said I am the resurrection hallelujah is that right you get the resurrection in you and when the resurrection happened you will be changed whoo hallelujah you can put any kind of air in a balloon dip but you can put regular in a balloon in that balloon my drop but you put that helium in there it's gonna go up hallelujah that's how it God hallelujah you just take the natural air and ain't not gonna happen but you send that air filled with that that spirit and that air from God you going up you going on hallelujah see what we need to know is this we've got to love one another you see a lot of time you know people say you know you know I just don't like brother Jones I don't like Brother sewing sewing something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart is broke it's just nearly kills you see we can obtain brotherly kindness and feelings with one another see but to maintain in a group of people why do you care for that brother because you're broke you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight see and you fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother and he might do some things in the flesh that you would disagree with because you just kind of Stacy but Shawn him a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happens to that brother it would just nearly kill you huh what we're saying sometimes you have brotherly kindness and you don't even know you got it huh we have our little ways about ourselves and we think oh my I can't handle this no more but let something happen to one of us Amen or less something happen to the brother that you think you didn't like and that brotherly kindness will come up and show herself mmm-hmm no all we think about is I wish I had done better right all right oh my old man once was was was young and now he said I've seen down three ages do that see hear people say I just want to have no more to do with him and something happened to that man it nearly kills him see I think Oh God let my precious brother go without making friends with him see his brother-in-law it looks like it won't stick but it it it does stick ha oh you don't understand when the squeeze comes you gonna see this brotherly kindness you go see this brotherly love a man shared up all this differences and you ain't gonna care users gonna be so glad to see somebody that you know is a Christian it is okay listen the Bible tells us says of Psalms I'm not gonna be long I'm almost done Psalms 133 says behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity there's nothing like it that's why God gives us all the Holy Ghost so that we can fellowship not only with God but fellowship with him why because when we fellowship with each other around the word that is God fellowshipping with himself that's what it is Philippians amen for us is endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit of the bond of peace endeavor work hard at it sometimes you got to work hard at it hallelujah can't just sit still and think it's just gonna come to you you got to work at it you got to do something right endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of us II know peace all right Philippians 4:11 not that I speak in respect to what well I have a learner in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound and everywhere in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer knee he he said hard can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me hallelujah that means I was getting a little weak but God came along and strengthened me anybody know what I'm talking about there are times I meant even in your trying times seem like the time prolong look like it goes so long and you said oh god how long you gonna let this day and just when you think Amen that you bout ready to break God bring a word God give you something to give you strength and then you roll your shoulders back and you're ready to fight some more she does that's God a man you know and the truth of the other the truth is if the Bible says when you say you we that's when you be strong you ought to say that hallelujah I'm never weak I'm strong but because my strength is up the Lord unity come with God from God the power of God and when the believer the Creator see where the creation here on earth that God has created is united with God then there comes a unity and gives faith and when a man see that he's persistent nobody is going to shake him you understand me I can't help her to think about that early church when Peter James and John was thrown into prison and they went into prayer and they shook shook the jailhouse and and we don't know how far the jailhouse was from the prayer room but it shook it a man you know I want to see something shake I want to see the saints of God getting such a unity that my problem is your problem it's not that we're separating I don't have my problem is it's my problem no no no my problem is your problem and your problem is my problem that's the way it's supposed to be hallelujah is that the way it's supposed to be absolutely oh my see when we get there we will understand we'll understand each other and I believe then we began to see angels hmm the church was so on one Accord the angels visit that prisoner broke the prison chains huh when you and I get on a call like we ought to be on a car and that one Accord is loving one another hey you know this church is universal but if we can just get this little fellowship like that mighty things will happen in this place hmm see I want to see Matthew and I don't know about y'all but I I've got some things on my agenda you know I know I'm gonna see Jesus Christ I want to see some others too when I get there right and no more than likely I'm gonna see a few of them before I get there because we have that 30 or 40 days resurrection Jubilee so if you see me jerkin and you don't see nobody bout me you see don't you worry about it brother Brooks ain't crazy I'm seeing some things that somebody else is not seeing hallelujah if I all of a sudden walking down the street hallelujah so you're not maybe I don't know who gonna start seeing at first but I know I'm gonna be one of them that all right I want to see Matthew Mark Luke John Paul Barnabas oh I won't see them all but you know what I want to see Jesus most of all is that right you know one thing you and I got such a great thing going on the Angels don't have no idea of what we shouting about they never been lost they never had to be redeemed hallelujah then a sit back amen and watch us sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound I don't know how far that's gonna reach throughout the heaven but I guarantee you the stars will be singing in and everything else with us hallelujah all I know is that one voice by the name of John he's a tall heaven heard me I can't imagine what that was like I don't know how he did it but he's a tall heaven heard me that was above that was beneath everywhere heard John say what glory oh my goodness I'm almost done see what we need to know is some kind of devil fights us and it's true because we forget you didn't do nothing to be saved absolutely not god save you say well I repented you wouldn't never repented that he until he gave you repentance huh hallelujah you know I cried at the altar all night long and then God giving you don't work yourself y'all understand me you don't work yourself in that way like you got them you gonna marry the Holy Ghost you know we crowd to the altar we're trying to yield to God it's yielding not begging them Oh God give me your Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost as a gift you don't beg for a gift you receive again but oftentimes our faithful let us receive it pride or whatever the case may be oh god I'm just so unworthy as long as you say that and keep saying that you ain't getting that nothing you ought to know you're unworthy before you get on your knees this gift is not based upon worthiness no it's a gift cause he gave it to you he said if you repent which he gave you repent and be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift at all ago so when you give before God you say Lord I repented you gave me repentance right I've done that I've been baptized No okay now my gift I'm the one you promised to give it to I've done it hold him hold him there hold him there hold him there to that sweet peace of release come upon you hmm you O God to his word he got to give it all right I'm almost done but when we when we crown him king of kings and Lord of lords people don't understand they don't understand some people think Christianity is a fairy tale some mine worked up in some man religion but what are these old days see I don't boast but I've seen the pillar fire you understand me my point is this faith produce that and God's grace because I believed it existed and God gave it to me God let me see it I've seen Oh different ones healed and delivered understand me I'm saying he gave me the faith to believe just like he gives every one of us faith to believe you can't even be saved without faith it is by faith you are saved right by the grace of God you were saved and it's through faith and who gives you the faith to be say how do you know you've been changed and who changed you huh see God changed you every one of us has a testimony that we could not change ourselves hello there were things that we were doing we wanted to get him free of and couldn't do it and here comes Jesus hallelujah and guess what those Devils know Jesus them you don't know him and when it's time to release you they got to release you Oh Lord we come to fellowship around the word this is what really makes us who we are jesus said man does not live by bread alone but by every word that
