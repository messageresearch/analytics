TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 6 beginning at the 11th verse therefore the heart of the king of syria was so troubled for this king and he called his servant and said unto him them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of israel and one of his servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speaketh in that bedchamber and he said go in spite where he is and i may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in dalton therefore sit he did the horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the service of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold and host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servants said unto him at last my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elijah prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountains was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha and when they came down to him elijah prayed unto the lord and said lord despite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smoked them with blindness according to the word of elisha our gracious father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and all that you have done for us lord we thank you father god for your mercy your grace there are any words that we can say to express our gratitude and our thanks the message the word for the hour is beyond our comprehension and so therefore we're taking you at your word and we believing it oh god and and we pray father in all that we say or do let that work of your work be completed in us build the statue of christ in us that we may see and understand not only what you're doing in our lives but the purpose for which you have sent us bless each and every one of us tonight as we commit the service into yo your hand lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i want to deal with the faith tonight by god's grace because sometimes we uh think faith is something in our heads and because we say i've got faith doesn't mean you have it faith in itself is a revelation it is something that god gives and no man can give that to you but once god give it to you no man can take it from you seeing and so my subject tonight would be seeing the invisible by faith and in order to see the invisible god must remove the veil you must know that heaven is here uh we we for a long time we we took uh you know science and things of that nature and you know we thought you know god was so far away from us that uh it you know we we could never you know really capture his his place of dwelling and um we thought for a long time that you know how we say it takes so many years or so many hundreds of years and so many light years to get to a certain place but because of the message we realized that those places that we thought were so far off is right here if those things are just invisible we can't see them unless god allow us to see them but but we must believe that they're there like abraham did he call those things that be not as though they were and in the mind of abraham that city in which he looked for whose builder and maker was god i mean he there was nobody could tell him that the city did not exist one of the reasons why he knew the city exists uh because he met the king of the city that you could not [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] here then god is here then the angels are here you see we often see jesus but we can't see the host that comes with him hallelujah but the bible says the angel of the lord has a host of angels hallelujah we're in a battle with the battle and god didn't leave you uh as an individual he did not leave you in battle alone matter of fact he's the one who's fighting the battle said he's my battle axe that's right is that right he had he he said he's my buckler he's my shield he's my protector he's my strong tower yeah i have a place i can run in and be saved hallelujah faith declares something you know it declares something even though you can't see it it declares that it's there right i look for a city whose building makers god he was declaring that that city existed and in that declaring it it existed amen because it was there before he declared it you understand me heaven is there you believe that how would you know that faith declares that it is it is not a knowledge in your head but it's a revelation in which god has given unto you amen hallelujah faith will acknowledge the word of god that's revelation because when you acknowledge the word of god you are acknowledging that the word is god amen yes sir all right it is it's such fake it's so fake it's a delusion it just it's just unreal the real is the thing we can't see and god is saying to you pray that the veil is removed that you might see that you are empowered with oh y'all better understand what i'm saying we are empowered not only with jesus christ but the host of heaven [Music] moses thought he was alone yes sir he knowed all them yakking people weren't going to help him they were just giving him trouble can you imagine millions of voices complaining in your ear screaming and hollering oh you you you you fake you led us to our death you know you had those kind of voices so much so it rattled moses see that's the difference between moses and david no matter how they rattled and yeah in david's ear when it came to goliath he says no you're going down today he didn't cry out to god help me lord see this great giant moses did he saw pharaoh as a giant amen he saw what the the situation was difficult you know why because you're trying to handle that which is supernatural that needs to be handled supernaturally naturally amen every time you and i fall into that natural state of being thinking that we're going to fix it it doesn't do anything it's like moses crying out to god and god's saying to you speak have faith and speak the word amen i love the story in kings and then i picked up this story because god spoke to my heart to uh go listen to the message um look into the unseen and i don't touch about two or three times before getting here this morning of this evening because that that that that uh it stirs me up every time and then on top of that one of the brothers y'all remember that little uh that little clipping of the angels singing hallelujah i had missed mine what i did with it the brother sent that to me and oh my then i get chills all over my body all over again and you know what i did i hit replay [Music] you know what because regardless whether they can say it's scientifically proven or not the atmosphere it literally raptures you as soon as you hear it [Music] y'all remember the time we were hearing in this church new year we were singing hallelujah man we had a mass choir in here and we knew it was not quite cause we weren't singing we can't see you but the point is god came down the same thing happened in mullen south carolina it was recorded i don't know whether they still got the recording but it was recording in mullen south carolina god's choir the difference between that choir and what we heard in mullins we didn't have a solo but we heard the choir and it was actually on tape oh my god during those time we we saw devils cast out we saw people healed and you know that's the supernatural what has happened to us your doctor is not a supernatural being he can't he can't do what jesus can do but we'll rather go there that's another that's another sermon but let's let's move on here we find out and let's read therefore the heart of the king syria was so troubled this thing what thing that's why the world is so troubled about the bride because we know the next move amen we've had elijah in our camp yes sir and elisha who represents us god has revealed to him amen everything the political realm is going to do amen and guess what he told us and we know they like they don't understand how these people who don't even have a church building can understand what's happening in the world we see it matter of fact we know the end of the story and here he you know the king he was upset because he thought that there was a spy in the camp hallelujah but it's not a spy we just have the all-seeing eye we have god on the inside and he's the one that's telling us what the next move is [Music] even the servant of of of the syrian army says no lord that's not the deal we don't have a spy there's no spies over there amen uh in our camp it's giving information back to the to israel no no no no israel got a prophet amen oh king what you don't realize is that everything you speaking in your chamber elijah is seeing it in his bed chamber you think listen listen i i was listening to brother adam today and he was just talking you know how uh and you have heard him say it many times a lot of times god is telling him things in his bed chamber or in his hotel room before he even gets to the meetings amen he already knows yes sir he knows where the skeptic is going to be setting he knows all of that and yet the pen holds his composure why because it was more than a man that's what people don't get see it has to be quicker i can't see you know god other people see malachi 4 as a prophet and why can't it has to be quickened amen oh you say oh well well brother brooks i don't know about that go to jesus himself how many people in israel among the jews knew that jesus was the messiah even his own disciples struggled with it hallelujah amen how many of them out of all of the preaching and everything he did all of the healing open the eyes of the blood turning water into wine they thought it was some kind of uh witchcraft that's right something the devil was doing [Music] thank god i didn't even know i could get that angry i thought i was over there i'm done yes i thought i left that in lima but it shook me and i was grateful because i realized devil had a corner in my life still and i didn't know it man guess what he's defeated yes god opened that thing so i can see now there's a spec there that you need to release guess what yes that's why he tells you that's why he's so bad that's why he he knows but he's got to point out things to us he you think oh god you know god's looking at moses said wait a minute moses these are people and now you're crying to me i don't give you the authority to do what you need to do and what are you doing moses i cry speaking yes sir you see that and it's that's easy it really is but you got to speak in the same amen with the revelation that god is going to hear you and that is going to come to pass that's right yes sir hallelujah i was in high school and i wanted to go to this specific college i'm not going to go through the whole thing but it was i receive if you want to say i'm not tooting my horn i'm just saying god allowed me i wasn't the smartest but i got the the highest scholarship in my class don't ask me i was once called an intellectual don't ask me where they derive that from i have no idea but there's a time because you know recollect things and you know and for a man who's had two strokes i think i do but you know my thing is this when it comes to god god ordains everything amen and you know what i thank god for every one of those little strokes i've had sir you know why it was way it was god's way of controlling me yes sir sure my goal was to be an astronaut and i was headed up but god says no you can be an not that kind amen hallelujah praise the lord anyway you go through all those things in life and you don't even realize god is directing you amen that's what he was doing for me right you said well where you brother can i be yes let me just share one more testimony my mom died when i was going through my senior year in high school she didn't even get a chance to see me graduate didn't have a daddy right and i you know what it was amazing because it took about a year or so maybe less than a year my senior year i graduated that summer following my graduation is when i i got saved and came to the lord but in all of that i inquired of the lord lord why you know that was my goal my college my education everything was for my mom i were you a mama's boy yes i was and she was my queen she was and i and i always i had already made a constitution if i met a girl she didn't like my mama she was out she didn't have to look she had to love me but she had to love my mama too you understand what i'm saying that was me but to make a long story short god said to me yo mama was your aussie you couldn't see me because she was in the way so god had to take my mom because he wanted a real person hey i would my you know how brother ben says god will call you for the last time well i experienced that and you know how i knew cause he told me he said if you don't listen this time i'll never call you again that's what he said guess what i listened amen people thought i was crazy but i was hearing the voice of god and i knew it he meant exactly what he said i just knew that and it scared me so bad that was on a friday night sunday i was in church but i say all of these things too and i was reminiscing over all of the things god has done for me has done for me you know to come to this place in my life you think that god is going to direct you all this way and then drop you like a hot cave no sir no ma'am he's there to take you all the way anyway let's move on so the king says okay let's find out where elijah is we're going to capture him oh did my understand me let's put it this way what if that is symbolic world council of churches surrounding the bride sure amen what you gonna do oh my god it's just so many they gonna kill me [Music] amen we need to stop tapping into the invisible and stop letting the devil smash us down i'm willing to fight now that i see who i really are i'm ready to go i'm fighting devils every and i know god is no longer there he's here yeah that's right he's indwelling me amen he's indwelling you yes hallelujah all right i can't pray to god like he's like i'm disconnected oh lord can you really conduct me today you're way up there and i'm trying to get your attention come on oh no i'm already connected you are connected if the holy ghost is in you you are connected you got the right god is in you that's right if you are the temple of god we need to you don't have to that's what the word of god says he's not a far off no we believe that for so many years brother said when i was caught up he said i was i could look down and see my bedroom amen but i was in heavenly place how is it a different dimension hallelujah and what we need to know is that we are not those of us who have been quickened those of us who have the holy ghost those of us who believe that this message is god you didn't get that on your education sir no way just like jesus said to peter flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven he has revealed amen amen unto you amen and upon this rock i'll build my church amen how many times brother branham tried to get the people to see it wasn't him yeah it was jesus christ amen fulfilling the scriptures and yet they still didn't get it say go ahead home let's see can we find him and one of his servants says now my lord o king but elijah the prophet that is in israel the kingdom of israel the words that thou speak in the kingdom of israel uh the words that thou speak it is in that bed chamber and he said go and spy where he is not going to send me some spies now and that i may sin and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he isn't thought now come on it just seemed like god knows how to blind people let me tell you if there was somebody on earth that knew what i was doing in my bed chamber or in my house and the news got back do you think i'm going to go challenge that and that's what they were doing god don't care how many in number and so i think the king thought you know he was safe because he had a host you know of syrians you don't understand even one can put a thousand to flight amen people need to read that old testament you'll see and that was with us amen amen amen all these things we need to start acting like amen preaching to myself sure and it feels pretty good amen yes therefore sending to the horses and chariots and the great hosts and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the service of the man of god was risen thoroughly going forth behold a host accomplished the city both forces and chariots and his servants said unto him unless my master how shall we do amen and he answered fear not he didn't even he didn't even tell him he just said fear not but they that be with us i'm more than they that be with them that's good amen that's right i want you to sneak around the back and see what they're doing no sir he said i'm not fearing this situation this moment don't scare me none of these things move me you understand me that's the way god wants us to be enemies armor of god [Applause] that's what we must do the word comes to correct us people amen thank you lord thank you what's needed you know we can say anything tonight but we need help amen amen i do amen and i don't receive it you see the word is sharper than a two-edged sword it comes to do what cut through amen discover what what's that problem yes amen amen it goes beyond the dna you understand this is it that's right have faith in god amen elijah praying this is what i love about it right because this is where god makes the syrian army stupid amen he literally he literally uh uh uh manifest the uh uh them being stupid yes because even israel knew what a prophet was right they feared prophets because they knew you don't use it they would ask the problem all the problem is come on this way ask him is it for good or for evil they wanted to know whether he was bearing good news or bad news because whichever news he bought they knew it was going to come to pass amen and you and i must understand by god's grace we are in a battle we are in a war and it ain't going to get easier it's going to get tougher the thing is we need each other that's right amen we need each other lord remove the veil that's what i've been asking god to help me remove remove the veil so i can see everything you know what i'm saying what are you saying brother saying listen elijah was the man who had the holy ghost now i don't know about his servant but because elijah said lord unveil unveil take away the veil that he may see that that dimension that i'm dealing with that i'm living in amen amen right the brother said that elijah didn't see he didn't see no army he didn't see any of that it was by faith and he knew that god was with him amen and when he says lord open his eyes see because elijah our spiritually already opened we knew that the god that chose him would never leave him alone and we need to see those things amen because guess what the devil will make you feel like you all alone sure man amen every one of us have felt that more than once sir that's right i fight that every day you know that sure i fight it every day but you live among christians like i said i fight it every day you know what i want from god he knows i won't tell you but he knows i almost told you but i ain't telling you nothing but god knows what i need and guess what by faith i'm going to get it yes how do you know because he that begun the good work in me he is faithful amen it has nothing to do with my faithfulness he is faithful why do you say that brother brooks because you and i have an unconditional covenant like abraham it is not what we do for him is what why am i still here praise god oh because you've been so righteous no no i haven't been so righteous i haven't been so holy i've done my best but the grace of god amen and his mercy is with me amen amen even so when he said when you've done all to stand you stand amen amen amen when you ain't got no more strength you just use the rest of your spirit to stay amen but faith is a revelation coming from the message the anointed one of the end time brothers of his faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be that's right amen amen amen faith is a revelation oh i i didn't even know i had that part of it but yes faith and i knew that faith is a revelation of the will of god amen so by revelation if you understand me it is it's the will of god for you amen and when god promised you something you got to say amen amen and the churches today don't even believe in spiritual revelation they believe in dogmatic teachings of some system by revelation abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified he was righteous amen amen i hope you see that see where we're living see the hour amen you say what do you mean god gave abel the revelation of his sacrifice and he did what god said do and god called him righteous amen you see the prophet you see what god has done and who he was amen amen why you got eyes to see because the bible said my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow amen but god has declared us righteous amen but he failed kingdom to keep that word he failed to have a revelation oh it's not by works it's by blood amen his blood amen he became your sin that we might become y'all believe that scripture you can't believe one part and not the other you don't have to feel it you don't what i'm talking about has no feelings to it at all but it's something that you know that you know that you know that you know that's right i don't understand why i'm bribed i know i've gone down the list of things in my life trying to figure out where but you understand there is no evidence yes sir there's no no proof that i could give you that would qualify me to be bribed fellow no none the only thing i have is having faith in his election amen and the revelation he's given me you see that's why i don't worry about cults i don't worry about joining this and joining that and this little whatever the message and that because i know who i am amen security is in jesus christ and him alone y'all understand me man not some building not some man no no no nothing like i preached last sunday but jesus only jesus alone he's the only one no one else amen amen and the revelation is the only thing the revelation of the word what is a revelation jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church in the gates of hell can't prevail against it faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you amen amen amen abel by faith offered by revelation faith offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than a amen amen you know if god did not open our eyes to what the message is we've been right there trying to figure it out and work it out by law that's right and as long as you work in it by law you don't have it the understanding of it yeah amen that's right this law that we work by is love he said if you love me you'll keep my commandments that's right you understand me but all of the holiness and all of the righteousness i could possibly do would still not give me a right to the tree of life you got to be born again did you know that and you gotta understand that that only those who have been predestinated and elected you're the only one that's redeemable amen amen amen god have mercy i wish i had some showers he had tonight yes that's the only way amen [Music] there's nothing you can do he chose you he chose me found out he was real no sir before the foundation of the world amen that's right hallelujah amen now faith is a revelation from god now faith is a revelation that's where i want to stay my family don't call me everything some of the things they don't call me i don't think i really want to hear it but you don't even message people they don't call me all kind of stuff too i don't care you know me it's like that yes sir that's right it's going to come they're going to persecute you that's right i'm on your own they're gonna say whatever they want to say amen and they hope to disturb you hallelujah they hope to disturb you it bothers them when they gossip and talk bad about you and you're not disturbed that's right thank you lord that's right he can't understand it man i can't do that he got me in church the truth of the matter is god has fortified us we understand amen amen is that right church brothers church brothers david you just trying to be out here you just want to be naughty you just you want to show off you you want to show off you just wanna you know what i'm saying they were so negative he could have really been really hard on him you know he could have been he couldn't say you cowards no but you know he put it in a nice way up amen he's enough tell me is it not a call is there another cause man amen here it is this goliath's over here making all that bulls and noise and y'all up here pile up like a pile of scared rabbits or something oh my that's right man is that not a cause listen people that's what we're seeing right now people are afraid of the devil but it's true yeah we're so have you ever seen it anymore [Music] now you gonna make god a liar when he said great is he that's in you than he that's in the world god said even if you take up something deadly it shouldn't harm you that's right if you drink something it's not going to poison you no sir why because you have a revelation [Music] sheltered in his arms and the bible said we are under the shadow of his wings amen y'all know i preached that the other day right the wings of god the old testament and the new testament hallelujah brought through a man a prophet in our day amen amen riding on the wings of an eagle amen now faith is a revelation from god now faith is a revelation there's where i want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation it has to it has revealed it he has revealed it to you by what his grace listen closely if nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith no you ever have faith is given to you by the grace of god amen amen and god reveals it to you amen therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church of god is built upon the revelation that's right [Music] you know i fast too i like fasting because it really helps your mind and your spirit amen you know what i mean it's good for you you know what i mean and uh uh you know i do pray a lot of time we think oh if i just i've done it lord i want to pray three hours now what you gonna say in three hours oh my god amen because you feel if i pray three hours it's going to impress him that ain't it and listen and if he don't come on the scene you want to pray in the spirit whatever you do do it in the spirit amen amen amen you want god to come down and bless your prayer amen if you get lost in prayer and you pray three hours that's god holding you in the conversation but you don't have the right to hold him in there you say well jacob said i i'll wrestle with that angel and i'm not gonna let you go until you bless me amen that's really the only time you're praying for the holy ghost that's what you need wrestling with god amen things that you can't explain to others but you you it's real this is real is your sight listen we spend so much time trying to get other people to see our vision when they can they can't do it and some of the most spiritual people can never see what you see what it's true tabitha said wait a minute peter's at the door no there's something wrong with you you must have seen a ghost no no no peter but no he's in jail he should be dead right now all right they didn't even believe the power of their own prayer that's right and when god brought it to pass they still had a hard time receiving it amen what about when you pray in faith believe that you shall receive it the word of god said you did not receive it he didn't tell you how long it was going to take america all amen amen amen i'm telling you god in prayer one time told me he'd given me all my children they'll be there with me there we go amen and sometimes i think why did i say that over the poop here yes because the moment i gave god praise satan again came down you know he's been working ever since it's the truth but what am i going to do amen see you can not judge it by your natural sense that's right amen you don't know what god is doing on the inside of it and guess what amen you and i have a word we don't have a right to give up on anyone no sir except they blaspheme the holy ghost amen amen amen you don't know what god is doing but i don't even think they could be redeemable that you know brother adam said this and that but you know what in all of that if you take the law of everything and you forget grace yeah amen you're gonna miss congress [Music] and if we're going to bring it down to the lord then all of us lost that's right because guess what ain't none of us can even fulfill what brother branham said we need to do that's right amen amen can i get an amen it's the truth if you're gonna go by law go to the least of it being on time so you and i must understand that god's grace ye are saved amen it's not works it's by grace don't ever forget that amen i'm almost done in a audience of people where a prayer line comes through you'll find some and they were all good people we'll say there are some that are trying hard to believe it trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all and others is just by the grace by grace it's just given to them now there is the difference now you know that you know that's true yeah come on somebody there are some people amen that they can just catch it just like that and they can move like so quickly listen it ain't your intellect that did that oh sir it's god's grace you know peter said wait a minute i got the first revelation on who jesus was yeah and jesus said wait a minute peter your school didn't give you that no my father which is in heaven right you got no business posting no okay that's right sometimes we just think that we could no no no that ain't the way it works all of us grow at a certain time in a different time it's just the way god works with us amen now there is a difference see that does it that the real revelation because faith is a revelation from god it must be revealed first and this is what i try to tell people who are sick you can't go hoping no oh i hope well the word of god yes the word of god says with these stripes we are healed but have you received your revelation that you're healed it comes personally yes amen and that's why people the revelation didn't strike i haven't struck them so much so that they could say well i'm not worried about no doctors y'all understand me when a revelation strikes you that you're healed you are healed that's right amen amen neil town y'all remember me on town this little girl had been on her sick bed how many nine years or so hadn't been hadn't seen outside or nothing for nine years because of anyway some bad stuff took place in her her family had put her over a bed of affliction but she cried out to god and god in response told the prophet there's a lamb down there that's right do you think you will cry out to god and god not answer your prayer no sir he's going to answer it he don't know how he's going to do it but prayer in god's mind and god's eye has already been answered amen you say right daniel i heard your prayer 21 days ago amen sage's job is to him the response the the the manifestation but he can't stop it that's right that's right amen amen no jesus clearly expressed this when he said no man come to me except my father draws him first or reveals reveals me to him first you ought to read that it's saint james james and saint john 6 44 and 46 they didn't know who he was they thought he was just an ordinary man they thought him to just be as as people does today some prophet he was a prophet he wasn't already an ordinary man but there was more than that amen see just like like like just like last night speaking when you get the book you're going to see maybe a little confusion there what i said the two book of life and it seemed uh same book but one of them is your natural birth and the other one is your spiritual birth one leads out to the other uh uh a one just like a stalker weak well now you talk of me you talk of me as a living person but there's a part of me here is is that person that must perish that's the book that the name comes off of but the eternal one the predestinated one the elected one the name never can come from there because it was always in it yep amen see it can never be taken off you notice it in the book to to so to save your confusion you'll find it that way because i think brother vale who put the right grammar to it reminded me of it today said that's right so what are you saying if you can get a revelation a true revelation of yourself and your name put being placed on the on the last book of life it will literally revolutionary your life it will change you amen revolutionize your life it will change you it would make you a new creature amen hallelujah i'm almost done because the reason why i'm working with faith in revelation because at this point in time in your life you can't hope it you can oh i hope i make a rapture that means you don't have the revelation of that that's right if you don't know that you're in the rapture right now you need to know amen because let me break it listen to the simplicity of it once you have received the holy ghost if you've been quickened you were dead and now you come to life amen you're living don't you still live in this dirty filthy house the end with man is a new life amen amen that man would grow up into the world he would grow up into christ as paul said he that that man on the inside because the seed that you uh was quickened was an eternal seed that's right amen you understand me it was the seed of god that was quicker than you that brings you to life when that brings you to life it brings you from death to a resurrection amen so you're already resurrected sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus amen and what we're now waiting on is the great revelation of resurrection when these modern bodies were put on immortality amen amen you're being changed amen from glory to glory the rapture just don't come oh it comes in a twinkling yes yes and it has and it is and you know what i'm saying at the end of the day boom you from one dimension to the next whatever and however he interprets they ain't getting stuck with all that kind of crazy stuff one riding on the right red horse and coming you know people want to divide it with stupid stuff like that just live holy a simple life keep in contact with god and he'll bring into manifestation we struggle at a net and swallow a camel sometimes but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her yes that revelation how many of y'all caught that last week when i read that quote about his coming you if that ain't quicken to you you ain't gonna see it yeah that's right like a lot of message people they still back there trying to be the pentecostals it didn't work for them what makes you think is going to work for you amen and if the life has moved out of the shop what make you think that's life yeah amen you understand me there's a lot of things that make a lot of noise but it doesn't mean that it is living amen a wagon can make noise yeah an empty one anyway now let me move on he said what that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture you need to tell me that a revelation comes before the rapture yes sir yeah revelation of the rapture amen that means there's a hidden thing it's a mystery man it is something that is not openly seen amen i think if everybody knew what was happening with enoch they would have said hey buddy let me walk with you that's true you know sometimes god has people that they just stuck yeah because though for the prophet knew eli was going up they knew elijah i think it's 400 but they knew he lied a little uh those false prophets for the school of prophet let me put it away school of prophets knew elijah was going up and they said elijah don't you know that the light job is going to go up yes sir you think they would say hey like they would be like elisha i want to go up there just like the people in the world the churches they watch us they watch the world we preach they will agree they'll know it's true but you see what they won't mess with it all right they lose their status let's see how great their status will be when we leave when we're gone that's so that's crazy the more i think about this world i think who would want to hold on to this anyway every day you go through the same old helen is not going to be like this 24 hours of nonsense no sir faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it was not so god so whatever the devil comes and tells you you got to say that him too [Music] well abraham how do you think you're going to have a baby as old as you are oh my god you get all humpback you know what i'm saying i'm sure he had all kinds of things to say brother said he was kind of stupid you know what i'm trying to say he had all the evidence to make him just believe but he knew how do you believe he said because god says amen amen that's why because god says amen they didn't with no preacher no bishop or pope god said so amen you can't let nobody stop you people you got to keep moving i'm almost done well well ah what time is it yeah it's just a weekend i don't know i don't want to keep each other you're quick in my revelation this is why i wonder how come some people they can sit so still in church like they live sitting in a classroom you know it bothers me it literally i get jealous of god because we'll go out there and we'll laugh and have all that loud talking and everything else and then when we come up in church we almost act like you know the lord is in his temple that all the earth keeps silence you right you're the amen of the word amen you're the amen i'm not asking for amen but i'm saying if the word is right you say amen not in your head that's amen i can't eat you how do i know it's going right in boxes when brown said when i hear them say amen that means like sick of them yes sir when i don't you say amen it's like sit down you're too low i have battles no wonder joyful tears can run down our cheeks no wonder our hearts quiver and shake when we can feel that same transforming power coming into our lives and filling us even out for letting us speak in a language that comes from heaven we're so and this is 1965 he's saying this we're so quick and up into the presence there prophecy foresee foretell and everything hitting perfectly with the word if it's prophecy contrary to that don't believe it but if it's with the word it's already said thus saith the lord fear not amen i am he that was and alive forevermore that is god's easter seal that seals every letter of this word into your heart what is the field you are written epistles read of all men you know that but when god has claimed you he sealed you with easter seal that you are risen with christ and you're not and you are a what new creature amen going on power transformer enoch was translated from death by god's transforming power amen what did god do that for for a type of the rapturing church that's coming that's the power of transformation amen you love the lord amen hallelujah my last quote what would he be what would he be he would be like hebrews 13 8 the same that he was he's always been he would be the word of god made manifest that's exactly he was god's word he is god's word he's forever being god's word even the sounding forth of his coming was always the prophets who the word came to hear the word come in amen people of god it's so in here it would be you that'd be a blind man to not see it and what we need to do is say hey it's been a long time and god has waited on us yes thank you lord because the message has been finished amen amen brother left off the scene in 1965 but he said by god's grace that we've gotta catch up amen and i believe we caught up to the hour that we're living in the revelation was far the road but now we can see clearly what's being said and what is required of us all i can say by god's grace may the mercy and grace of god be with you amen and vice versa at me blessed thank you okay [Music] oh me [Music] tv [Music] me [Music] me [Music] oh okay [Music] is nobody [Music] nobody me [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh
