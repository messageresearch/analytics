[0:01] if he was passing this way would you
[0:03] reach out and tou you if he was passing
[0:06] this way would you grab the Hem of His
[0:09] Garment if he was passing by your way
[0:12] you remember see everybody didn't know
[0:14] who he was when he came into the city
[0:16] but it was only the the Bible says the
[0:18] crowd was moved but only a few group
[0:21] could say hosan hosan and there was
[0:24] still some there watching and they were
[0:26] just as they said in the Old Testament
[0:27] looking to God to gaze but there was
[0:29] some people that knew that when Jesus
[0:31] passes by your way that if you the
[0:35] individual just Reach Out And Touch him
[0:37] then what he said every promise in the
[0:40] book is yours this morning now remember
[0:43] you see a promise means nothing until
[0:45] you know that it's yours when something
[0:47] is yours it means symbolize it it means
[0:50] you associated with it it means that
[0:52] you're identified with it so this
[0:54] morning be identified with the promise
[0:56] this morning the promise of everything
[0:58] that God said you see we come to church
[1:01] we must know that it's a supernatural
[1:03] thing just to get out of your bed it's a
[1:05] supernatural thing when you get out of
[1:07] your bed to then just be able to go and
[1:09] take a shower it's a supernatural thing
[1:12] to then go and just grab your toothbrush
[1:14] and a supernatural thing after you brush
[1:16] your teeth to go and have clothes to put
[1:18] on your back you say now as you get
[1:20] dressed now it's supernatural that God
[1:22] even put gas in the car and let it crank
[1:25] for you to get here this morning because
[1:27] I want you to see this this morning
[1:29] there are some that wish brother Brooks
[1:31] they're in the hospital that have no
[1:32] arms and can't clap they have no arms
[1:35] and can't clap there are some even
[1:37] soldiers that gave their life for this
[1:38] country that now even the the wife is
[1:41] coming home with maybe one leg and she
[1:44] can't jump out of the bed and maybe go
[1:45] fix the kids breakfast but she may not
[1:48] now have a revelation this morning that
[1:50] if Jesus passed by her
[1:53] way if Jesus passed by away then
[1:56] something would move a person Beyond
[1:58] excuses Beyond the rain it said beyond
[2:01] the heartache Beyond Monday morning but
[2:03] something would reach and grab that
[2:05] mother and say I must go to the house of
[2:08] God you see going to the house of God is
[2:11] a revelation my brother and you have to
[2:13] know that you're blessed cuz blessed is
[2:15] he that see that reth and keepeth the
[2:16] saying that in his book because God has
[2:19] dropped down and quickened something in
[2:20] your heart that when you come to the
[2:22] house of God that even if I was just a
[2:24] doorkeeper I'm blessed just to come and
[2:28] you see we are blessed people this
[2:29] morning
[2:30] there is no big eyes and little you it's
[2:32] only one in Jesus Christ it's Jesus is
[2:36] passing this way he's passing this way
[2:39] he says right
[2:41] now oh you see it's you see you see
[2:44] remember I didn't promise but and I
[2:47] could say anything and break my promise
[2:50] any preacher any man any boy or girl but
[2:53] Jesus can never break his word and if
[2:56] you're believing now in him this morning
[2:58] he said well two or more come gathered
[3:02] together in his name he said that there
[3:04] he be in the midst but brother Randy you
[3:07] didn't see him come through the wall
[3:09] this morning he could have maybe passed
[3:11] right by you and he could just look to
[3:13] see what brother Randy's doing on the
[3:14] keyboard and he said maybe just that
[3:16] empty seat sitting next to
[3:20] you just that empty seat sitting next to
[3:23] you that God said I you know what I need
[3:26] maybe a little bit more room this
[3:27] morning Hallelujah so you see you just
[3:30] give him a little room why don't you let
[3:31] him talk to you this morning oh lord
[3:34] lord I I I don't know exactly where to
[3:38] get started but I can tell you I said
[3:41] that it's something to see people just
[3:44] come and you see there's many other
[3:47] beautiful churches there's many other
[3:49] big buildings there's many other pools
[3:52] maybe family maybe cousin or boss or
[3:55] coworker but why would God lead you here
[3:57] this
[3:58] morning why would because you see to
[4:00] lead means you also must follow and to
[4:03] follow means you must respond so it's a
[4:06] pull not just you but it's something
[4:08] pulling you and that's you see that's
[4:11] what I hope we see this morning it's
[4:13] something that's pulling us here that's
[4:15] keeping us day after day brick after

[4:40] me to um This Job 31 I'm going try to
[4:44] just read a couple scriptures and let
[4:45] you have your seat amen and thank you
[4:47] for

[4:52] know before I kick off at a ball game
[4:54] everybody stands out and I said wow why
[4:57] is that because the pig skin
[5:02] going but brother Joe Here we are now
[5:05] House of God this
[5:06] morning that's a that's that's an honor
[5:08] to his word Job 31 I got verse
[5:14] 9 it says if my heart have been deceived
[5:18] by a woman or if I have laid weight at
[5:21] my neighbor's door then let my wife
[5:24] grind into another and let others bow
[5:26] down upon her for this is a heinous
[5:29] crime
[5:30] yay it is Iniquity to be punished by the
[5:35] judges let's look at this other
[5:37] scripture
[5:38] here let's look at
[5:41] uh uh let's look at um Deuteronomy
[5:46] 11:16 just to make it sure here
[5:52] 11:16 then it be Hebrews 2 that's
[6:02] look at this uh it says
[6:08] here take heed to yourselves that your
[6:11] heart be not
[6:13] deceived and ye turn aside and serve
[6:16] other gods and worship them and then the
[6:21] Lord's wrath be kindled against you and
[6:23] he shut up the heaven that there be no
[6:25] rain that the land yield not her fruit
[6:28] lest ye shall perish
[6:30] L you perish quickly from off the good
[6:32] land which the lord giveth you in
[6:36] Hebrews
[6:42] 2:1
[6:43] amen it says
[6:47] uh therefore we ought to give the more
[6:51] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[6:54] heard lest at any time we should let
[6:57] them slip for if the words spoken by
[7:00] Angels were steadfast and every
[7:02] transgression and Disobedience received
[7:04] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[7:07] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[7:10] which at the first began to be spoken by
[7:12] the Lord and was confirmed To Us by them
[7:16] that heard him amen let us
[7:20] pray oh Lord gracious Heavenly Father
[7:23] Lord we just come before your throne
[7:25] this morning and we know Lord God that
[7:28] anyone could turn the pages of of this
[7:29] book lord God but heavenly father one
[7:32] thing we know Lord God that it takes you
[7:34] to drop down and reveal it to our hearts
[7:36] Lord and Heavenly Father we ask you Lord
[7:39] this portion of service if you'll come
[7:40] Lord May any Lord demonic Spirit try to
[7:43] come against the mind and heart of your
[7:45] people Lord God and we place on our feet
[7:47] Lord that your holy spirit will have
[7:49] free reign this morning and that Lord
[7:51] you would come Lord and shower your
[7:53] blessings of your word to our heart Lord
[7:55] God and Father Lord may you speak
[7:57] heavenly father to your people may you
[8:00] move me out the way Lord God For Your
[8:02] Glory we ask this in the name of Jesus
[8:04] Christ Lord we just say
[8:07] amen amen you just have your seats
[8:12] amen thought I had amen one water take a
[8:16] sip I don't know what I
[8:19] with
[8:23] see oh thank
[8:26] you um
[8:32] hey man I want to just read something to
[8:34] you really
[8:36] quickly but I tell you that felt
[8:39] good
[8:41] uh me read something to
[8:45] you
[8:47] now but now cancer in the body or cancer
[8:50] in the soul now listen to this it says
[8:54] cancer in the body of the soul the demon
[8:57] can come in either place
[9:00] when a person now is attacked by cancer
[9:03] or is said a person is attacked by any
[9:05] Spirit contrary to God it can attack
[9:08] your body and it can attack your soul
[9:12] and it says that now there's many times
[9:14] many people with good thoughts and good
[9:16] people who try many times to rest upon
[9:19] some little
[9:21] theology they have or something they
[9:23] have been taught since they were a child
[9:26] and still find that down in their being
[9:28] down in their soul
[9:30] they still have something that's not
[9:33] right and many are here this morning no
[9:36] doubt wherever you find Christians
[9:38] gathered together you find people who
[9:40] have those Spirits in them and it's
[9:44] undesirable they don't want them and
[9:46] they say if you've ever heard this
[9:48] before Oh if I could only quit
[9:51] lying if I could only quit lusting if I
[9:55] could only quit this or that now that is
[9:58] devils
[10:00] and now they come in the form of
[10:03] religion many
[10:05] times now I want you to see this with me
[10:08] just turn with me to Matthew
[10:10] 24 it says see in the day and hour that
[10:14] we're in brothers and sisters it's like
[10:18] there's many spirits on the land and
[10:21] there's many different voices in the
[10:23] land and you see when you listen to the
[10:26] wrong voice it'll pull you down the
[10:28] wrong track it'll take you to the wrong
[10:30] place it'll have you with the wrong
[10:32] people it'll have you doing things that
[10:34] you don't want to do saying things you
[10:36] don't want to say it says be because now
[10:39] let's not be ignorant here of Satan's
[10:41] devices we're not Waring against flesh
[10:44] and blood but we're Waring against
[10:47] Spirits so now Spirits is something that
[10:50] you may not see with your natural eye a
[10:52] spirit is something that now it says
[10:54] that there are spirits in the room today
[10:57] and it says in every service we have
[10:58] three kind of Believers a Believer
[11:00] unbeliever and a make believer at every
[11:01] service so that means that some really
[11:04] want to hear the word of God an
[11:05] unbeliever might get up halfway through
[11:07] and say I don't care what Brother Kyle
[11:09] say I'm still going to heaven or I don't
[11:10] care because I want to go to hell it
[11:12] just walk out but then that make
[11:14] believer was sit there just long enough
[11:17] and just kind of watch and see what's
[11:19] going on and and maybe wait to hear just
[11:21] the wrong thing or the or think they
[11:24] think is wrong or think they know that
[11:26] is wrong or want it to be wrong and then
[11:29] now they start to Feast on that thing
[11:32] instead of the unadulterated word of God
[11:35] so there's no way that you can
[11:37] understand the mind of God without what
[11:38] his holy spirit so you see he tells us
[11:41] in the last day even in John he says but
[11:43] Beloved the children of God he said
[11:46] trust not every Spirit but he says try
[11:49] the spirit he said whether it be what of
[11:51] God or not so if God gives us the
[11:55] ability to try spirit that means that
[11:57] now we must have something in us to be
[11:59] be able to discern now we say why is
[12:02] this important because many of us know
[12:04] that there's still lying going on in our
[12:07] home many of us know that now there
[12:09] still when we go to our jobs there's
[12:11] still now Strife on our jobs with those
[12:13] that one wants to get ahead of another
[12:15] and they'll lie they'll s they'll
[12:17] they'll cheat they'll steal and do
[12:18] anything to try to get ahead amen so you
[12:21] see here you're faced with it every day
[12:23] whether you're a Believer or not you're
[12:24] dealing with now contrary Spirits so he
[12:28] says this now that demon when it comes
[12:30] is coming to either now affect also your
[12:33] body your mind but it really wants to
[12:35] torment your soul am and it wants to now
[12:37] pull you so far away from God that then
[12:40] now you start to have mind bounds you
[12:43] could come to church and you wonder am I
[12:45] really hearing the truth is this what
[12:48] God wants me to do is this what is this
[12:51] God speaking to me justes God if this is
[12:54] God then Lord then just show me your
[12:57] will but if it's not Lord I don't want
[12:59] nothing of it so it has to be something
[13:02] to get you off the cliff and then they
[13:04] say into the game you have to at some
[13:07] point make a decision and you have to
[13:09] say Lord please lead me and guide me and
[13:12] until you do that then now you're just
[13:14] roping do yes sir so you look at this
[13:17] when Jesus now when he saw Simon he knew
[13:22] Peter Peter walked on water he was there
[13:25] with him from the beginning he called
[13:26] him when he was a fisherman he said I
[13:28] make you fishal men he saw the healing
[13:31] of jarry's daughter he saw all the
[13:33] Miracles the signs the wers he saw
[13:35] everything but yet until he received the
[13:38] Holy Spirit he told him one day it was
[13:41] at Luke 23 he said now after they' been
[13:44] talking and talking he said Simon Simon
[13:46] he gave him a warning he said the Satan
[13:50] wants to sift you like we am and I want
[13:53] you to see here he says now he goes
[13:55] about as a roaring lion seeking to steal
[14:00] kill and destroy and he warned him and
[14:03] he told him he said it's only until you
[14:05] get converted that then at that point
[14:08] that you can go and strengthen your
[14:10] brother so you can't just go out of here
[14:13] with no strength with no virtue with no
[14:16] Holy Spirit and go strengthen anybody
[14:18] else it says you might find yourself now
[14:22] confused you might find yourself
[14:24] bewildered you might find yourself now
[14:26] wondering well who is God there's many
[14:28] people that go to school and they leave
[14:30] Seminary school as atheist because now
[14:33] you see they were saying that there was
[14:34] a study I was seeing recently they said
[14:36] people between the 18 ages between 18
[14:38] and 29 it says that they're now they
[14:40] don't have faith that all the word of
[14:42] God is true anymore and you ask how many
[14:45] of the younger generation they really
[14:47] now they even hear their parents talking
[14:49] about the Lord many come from different
[14:52] broken homes they come from different
[14:54] situations they're hearing things on
[14:55] television they're listening to all
[14:57] these different voices and they don't
[14:59] know that now Satan is going about to to
[15:02] kill their sto to now just choke the
[15:04] very life out of them so what does he
[15:07] say here he tells it when he says he
[15:09] goes about the steal kill and destroy
[15:12] he's trying to tell them what he's
[15:14] saying be careful it says don't be
[15:18] cheated and that's what we just want to
[15:20] talk about this morning don't be cheated
[15:22] amen you see to be cheated you see
[15:25] another word for cheated means
[15:27] deceived but if you You' ever been
[15:29] cheated before maybe playing Monopoly
[15:31] anybody play Monopoly here and playing
[15:34] Monopoly you know how it is maybe you
[15:36] get up and you go to the bathroom and
[15:38] you got all the houses you got Parkplace
[15:40] and boy while you come back and then
[15:42] your brother he got
[15:44] hotels now we ain't roll no dice you
[15:47] know nobody went around jail collected
[15:49] $200 but now you see that there's been a
[15:52] displacement of what he had so when you
[15:54] left and you came back from the bathroom
[15:56] now it seemed like your brother's
[15:58] wealthy now yeah and you wonder what
[16:00] happened but what really happened is
[16:02] somebody cheated you and you see it
[16:04] doesn't feel good to be cheated when you
[16:07] cheated you've been slighted you've been
[16:09] begal you've been somebody has now found
[16:11] an angle on you and they're trying to
[16:13] pull something over your eyes so he
[16:16] tells him he says now in the last day be
[16:18] careful because it's not just that he's
[16:22] going to deceive you but he's also going
[16:24] to cheat you and I want you to see here
[16:27] now that is what you see in the last day
[16:30] that now as Satan is rising up he's
[16:32] trying to now steal everything that the
[16:36] people had when they beli the word of
[16:38] God they trusted in God all the promises
[16:41] that they believed in now he's trying to
[16:43] take their faith and believe that maybe
[16:46] Jesus ain't coming back maybe that you
[16:49] know he's having a good time somewhere
[16:51] or maybe that Jesus he just he has
[16:53] something else maybe we didn't read the
[16:55] scripture right and now should you
[16:56] should just believe in what the church
[16:58] say
[16:59] now you should just take what the church
[17:01] say and I want you oh Lord look at this
[17:04] in Matthew
[17:05] 24 just want to read a couple scriptures
[17:08] to you first look at this please with me
[17:10] in Matthew uh let's look at um well I'll
[17:13] just go ahead and read Matthew 24 and
[17:15] verse let's just drop down make it short
[17:17] uh and
[17:19] 22 now this is Jesus speaking and he
[17:23] tells us now he says except those days
[17:26] be short now he's talking about the end
[17:29] time and he says unless the end days be
[17:33] shortened it's like a guy you go to
[17:35] prison the guys everybody in prison
[17:36] wants a short bid because when you've
[17:39] done wrong then now nobody wants to sit
[17:40] there for 30 20 30 20 30 years but they
[17:44] want the sers to be shortened now Jesus
[17:46] comes and he tells us he says I'm going
[17:48] to shorten the time in the end time and
[17:51] listen what he says because if he didn't
[17:53] shorten the time he said that not one of
[17:56] us would make it
[17:59] and this is what he said as much as you
[18:00] love God this morning and your neighbor
[18:03] says they love the Lord I want you to
[18:05] see he said unless he shorten the time
[18:08] that none of us would make it so that
[18:10] means that now it's going to be some
[18:12] very very trying times that would come
[18:15] and they would try people that have
[18:16] confessed with their mouth and said they
[18:18] believe in their heart that they love
[18:19] the Lord but now God is going to bring
[18:21] pressure and he said it's got to be so
[18:24] just so he can bring forth
[18:26] Jews just so he can bring forth Jews so
[18:29] what we're speaking of now today is in
[18:31] this Christian Journey there has to be
[18:34] pressure yes and don't let anybody think
[18:37] and tell you that you're just going to
[18:38] catw walk out of here that's not where
[18:40] we're at this morning you see the
[18:43] pressure comes that now it will be close
[18:45] enough for each and every one of us that
[18:46] we could see that we can only make it
[18:48] out of here by the grace of God Amen not
[18:51] only by his grace so here he comes and
[18:55] he says but for the elect sake though
[18:58] those days shall be short so you see
[19:01] those that may not know that they're
[19:04] elect if you don't know that you elect
[19:07] then now you might doubt along this
[19:10] journey let me say it very plainly along
[19:12] this journey you may say well I'm going
[19:15] to this is a tight week this is a off
[19:17] week let me go ahead and hold on to that
[19:19] $100
[19:21] tith cuz you know I need gasma and how
[19:24] I'm going to get to church if I don't
[19:26] hold on to this $100 now you go e Burger
[19:29] King you go to McDonald's he said you go
[19:32] out to eat all week at work lunch every
[19:35] day never take a sandwich but that $100
[19:39] oh Lord that $100 now it creates
[19:42] pressure in the home yeah and so now you
[19:45] see here what does it mean do you really
[19:47] have faith to believe that God promised
[19:50] yeah that he's shortening the time for
[19:53] your sake or do you want that
[19:55] cheeseburger with bacon you see I want
[19:58] think about that this morning because
[20:00] you see now these are the pressures and
[20:03] you see it's the first thing when you
[20:05] receive the wrong thought it'll turn
[20:07] into a lie that you'll believe and when
[20:10] you believe that lie long enough then
[20:12] now it becomes who you are you speak
[20:14] that lie you talk about that lie and you
[20:16] identified as a liar and you don't even
[20:18] know it you say I'm the most truthful
[20:20] man on the Earth but before God he said
[20:24] you're a thief and a robber so you see
[20:27] here these are the very think he trying
[20:29] to it's just very simple but he's
[20:31] telling us now let's be careful because
[20:34] deception is that simple deception is
[20:37] that you see it's only a little Le that
[20:39] 11 the L only a little so he says and if
[20:43] there be if any man shall say unto you
[20:47] Lo here is Christ or there believe it
[20:49] not why because he said there'll be many
[20:52] false Christ arise and false prophets
[20:55] and show great signs and wonders in so
[20:56] much now look what he says if it were
[21:01] possible they would deceive the very
[21:04] elect so it says now it would be that
[21:07] close is the rubby that he said it would
[21:09] deceive those because he says they at
[21:13] some point they start listen to another
[21:15] voice well you know I was watching TBN
[21:19] the other day Joyce Meers said something
[21:21] that moved
[21:23] me okay Joy's M and you say you know God
[21:27] can use anybody
[21:29] God can use a donkey you know I don't
[21:31] know what brother Brooks talking about
[21:33] this woman preaching stuff I need to go
[21:34] check him
[21:35] on you know one of the we had one of
[21:37] these Minister come through talking
[21:38] about women can't
[21:41] preach now where did he get that from
[21:44] God say he pour out his Spirit on All
[21:46] Flesh so you see now here comes a
[21:48] thought because you listen to Joy's M
[21:52] and then now right after that you was
[21:53] going to the bathroom you were wondering
[21:54] about that thing and then Paula White
[21:56] came
[21:57] on Paula White say yeah let me tell you
[22:00] how God used me other day so you see now
[22:03] here comes a thought in your mind that
[22:04] you start reasoning and if you reason
[22:07] long enough you'll go all the way back
[22:09] to eat and this woman who had a husband
[22:13] the woman who had resources she had help
[22:15] she had a I believe Adam was a nicel
[22:17] looking man yeah big man but on top of
[22:20] that he was a godfear man and being a
[22:23] godfear man that when the serpent went
[22:25] and spoke to her all she had to do for
[22:28] that every moment and stop and say one
[22:30] second let me go get my
[22:32] husband but she wouldn't stop for a
[22:35] second because she said I got this and
[22:38] you see and when you got this he said be
[22:41] careful take heed let you fall so you
[22:44] see none of us ain't got nothing but God
[22:46] got
[22:47] us I hope you see it because you see if
[22:50] we were there we would have done the
[22:51] same thing as
[22:53] her you see so now you see Adam couldn't
[22:56] fall he was Son of God we know but we
[22:58] looking at we see that the very thing
[23:00] that was close to him that he loved and
[23:04] she said she loved him when the came
[23:06] down to receiving not the written word
[23:09] but when it came down to receiving a
[23:11] spoken word that God spoke not a man I
[23:15] hope you see this she had the same she
[23:18] had the same audience with God as Adam
[23:21] it wasn't until after the fall he said
[23:22] then you'll serve your husband but there
[23:24] at that time they could have had all the
[23:26] fellowship they wanted but she doubted
[23:28] the word
[23:29] and when Satan walks into your mind you
[23:31] ad doubt the word and he uses the same
[23:34] trick that he's used all throughout the
[23:36] Bible lust of the eye lust of the Flesh
[23:38] and the pride life he comes and he says
[23:40] to her he says are you sure that God is
[23:43] going to kill you if you do wrong are
[23:45] you are you positive and he says well
[23:49] maybe not but God is nice I've never
[23:52] seen anybody
[23:54] do I've never seen a
[23:56] but I've never seen seen a bird follow
[23:59] the sky I've never seen a lion chase a
[24:02] lamb I my husband he's always been sweet
[24:05] to never spoke a harsh
[24:08] word everything is so sweet I don't even
[24:11] got to wear clothes the temperature so
[24:14] nice and he says to her he said are you
[24:18] sure that God is going to kill you if
[24:20] you do this one little
[24:22] thing and you see how is that not more
[24:25] so than what job said he said that that
[24:28] woman and he says if that woman come and
[24:31] she deceive you could be manad if they
[24:34] come and try to deceive you they're
[24:36] coming to a place that now they're
[24:38] trying to take your mind off the word of
[24:41] God and I want you to see now the Bible
[24:43] say we don't WR against flesh and blood
[24:44] but against spiritual wickedness
[24:46] principalities he said rules of this
[24:47] world and he says it's in high places
[24:50] high places now before I just get ahead
[24:53] of myself I want to just share something
[24:55] with you share something with you if I
[24:58] can get it up real quick just want to
[24:59] lay a background here look at this look
[25:01] at this uh listen to this if if you if
[25:04] you haven't heard it you might have I'm
[25:06] not sure but it was just something that
[25:08] caught
[25:09] my my attention because you know that it
[25:12] was a in Parade Magazine that the pope
[25:15] recently on Easter he had three
[25:18] different attitudes he wanted to share
[25:19] with the people and remember now your
[25:22] attitude toward the word he said that
[25:25] means everything amen Remember When
[25:28] Jesus came it says it was one woman that
[25:31] touched the H of his gar and her
[25:33] attitude when she touched it before she
[25:35] touched she knew that she'd be hungry
[25:37] amen and after all the people touching
[25:39] Jesus Jesus knew that virtue had went
[25:41] out of his body amen because and he
[25:42] asked who touched a woman and then here
[25:45] over here there was a man that R back
[25:48] and he spit in his face and he slapped
[25:49] him as hard as he could and when he
[25:52] slapped him he said you ain't you ain't
[25:56] no son of God look at you hit him his
[25:59] heart
[26:00] prophesy tell us which one
[26:03] is so you see it your attitude toward
[26:07] the word that determines everything amen
[26:10] and you see that's and I hope you see
[26:13] the pope now took uh uh some time and he
[26:17] took the moment to discuss three
[26:19] different attitudes that he felt that
[26:21] the whole world needed to he and I want
[26:23] you to hear this he says now look what
[26:27] he says he says here it was three things
[26:29] hopefulness openness and living in
[26:33] Joy now
[26:36] remember he said you we we have to live
[26:39] in joy and he says a Christian should
[26:42] always now live in joy and I just want
[26:45] to take that one not to go through all
[26:46] of it for time sake he says dear friends
[26:49] if we walk in Hope allowing ourselves to
[26:53] be surprised by the new wine that Jesus
[26:56] offers us we have joy in our hearts and
[26:59] we cannot fail to be Witnesses of This
[27:01] Joy Christians are are joyful they are
[27:06] never gloomy God is at our side and we
[27:10] have a mother who always intercedes for
[27:12] the life of her children for us as Queen
[27:15] Essa did in this
[27:17] reading now I want you to see it for a
[27:20] second now that they gave him I think
[27:23] last year year before the Jews gave him
[27:24] a a symbol of Dove they say he's the man
[27:26] of peace and he comes and he says he
[27:29] says that we're all Christians we all
[27:32] love the Lord but if you could just see
[27:35] if you want joy we all have a mother we
[27:38] all have a mother and you know her name
[27:42] she she has the immaculate son the one
[27:45] that's been created and I and I ask you
[27:47] this is he really trying to unite people
[27:50] to Jesus is his hard really to bring
[27:54] people closer to him or now does it
[27:56] sound so good that he still ready to
[27:58] cheat you he's ready to deceive you for
[28:02] now ready to say if you come and join
[28:05] together there'll be some underlying
[28:07] thing that you'll recognize and one day
[28:10] your money will be worth nothing that's
[28:12] what he said so now there's a message
[28:15] now to the people it says you better get
[28:17] ready and don't stop and stop playing
[28:19] around it says and better see what God
[28:22] is doing am so you see when Deception
[28:24] comes in when there's slothfulness when
[28:27] he says when you see yourself you see
[28:29] because the spirit of God leaving the
[28:30] Earth it's harder to pray brother Isa
[28:33] it's harder now to read your Bible you
[28:35] ever read you ever been sitting there at
[28:36] night reading your Bible you sitting
[28:38] there and next you know you wake up and
[28:41] you like praise the Lord you ever sat
[28:44] there for an hour looked at your Bible
[28:46] it looked at
[28:48] you and you wonder what in the world I
[28:50] just
[28:52] read you see now you see there's a pull
[28:55] you see it's not until you get in the
[28:56] spirit brother brother and then now it
[28:59] means something to you but you can open
[29:01] up the book you can come to church and
[29:04] you can say they come from the East and
[29:07] West they come from the lands of far
[29:10] praise the
[29:12] Lord and
[29:14] then if it doesn't mean anything to you
[29:17] you don't really know who they is
[29:19] brother tro you don't so you really
[29:22] don't know that it's talking about
[29:24] you you reading and now it's a promise
[29:27] in that book directly for you but
[29:29] because you don't see that God said he
[29:31] already provide and you have fell asleep
[29:33] you go in there you get mad and wife why
[29:35] you buy them grits why you always buying
[29:38] grits if you keep buying them grits we
[29:39] ain't G to have no money so you see now
[29:42] but you just read in the book that my
[29:44] father only count a thousand years but
[29:46] you better stop buying them grits so you
[29:48] see here now because you didn't catch
[29:50] the revelation of what God was trying to
[29:53] tell you he was saying that yeah she
[29:55] bought the Grits but that's going to be
[29:56] all right
[29:58] you see so then you could go in and
[30:00] maybe say something to whisper in the
[30:03] ear how you should oh this is how you
[30:06] handle you see
[30:09] remember if God now gave us as Kings and
[30:12] Priests over this Earth The
[30:15] Authority remember all from Genesis to
[30:18] rule over everything then in your own
[30:21] dominion in your own home God wants to
[30:23] now give you rues so he wants everything
[30:26] to be made perfect amen but it comes
[30:29] down to our hearts is that are we
[30:32] letting Satan cheat US of everything God
[30:35] has for us because you see if he
[30:38] deceives you then what'll happen is
[30:40] you'll see that in your time in your
[30:44] money it's not really set on the things
[30:46] that God has for you and you look a
[30:49] little closer and you say well Lord why
[30:51] am I struggling so much and it shows
[30:54] that it must be something kindled down
[30:56] in your heart for the word now to anoint
[30:59] that for it to come back to life and it
[31:02] means something in your life that now
[31:04] you know what even when I'm here in this
[31:07] place God is using me to help strengthen
[31:09] somebody
[31:10] else think about it every time you see
[31:14] every time you get closer to God it
[31:16] becomes harder and harder because God is
[31:19] pulling you he's pulling you but the
[31:21] trials that it says don't let these
[31:24] trials that that that seem to come to
[31:26] you be like uh strange to you don't
[31:28] think that they're uh you know just they
[31:30] come out of anywhere it's God allows
[31:33] those trials so that then now he knows
[31:36] that it'll push you closer to God well
[31:39] now you pray a little bit more you'll
[31:42] think about him a little bit more but if
[31:44] you let the devil come and deceive you
[31:47] then he comes now and he's taking the
[31:49] very sand from under your feet and we
[31:51] don't even know so Jesus said remember
[31:55] if he didn't short this time that none
[31:58] of us this morning would make
[32:00] it now think about this now so God has
[32:04] to come and do something that we can't
[32:09] do see he knows how to make provision
[32:12] brother he can now take time and make it
[32:17] shorter just to make sure you make it
[32:20] but because see I want you to catch this
[32:22] this morning what did he do but because
[32:25] before you ever came to this earth God
[32:28] put something in you called a seed and
[32:31] you see that seed it you cannot change
[32:34] what the seed the DNA of the seed the SE
[32:37] that sold the seed was the son of
[32:40] God he sold it into this Earth he
[32:43] created a vessel of clay he breathed
[32:45] into it the breath of life and now he
[32:47] said these two people that's going to
[32:48] come together when they come through sex
[32:52] they're going to have you sitting here
[32:53] this
[32:54] morning so here we are this morning all
[32:57] now creatures of God and God doesn't
[33:01] want any of us to be lost but now he's
[33:04] trying to do something on our have but
[33:06] now we have a responsibility too see God
[33:09] will do his part but will we do ours let
[33:13] me let me read something to you just
[33:15] turn with me to uh um uh Lord let's just
[33:19] go to 2 Thessalonians 2 want to read
[33:22] these scriptures to you just get them
[33:24] out the
[33:25] way look at these um
[33:30] 2 Thessalonians 2 it says verse
[33:33] three now look what it says here I just
[33:36] start verse two that ye be not soon
[33:39] shaken in your
[33:40] mind you don't want the devil to come
[33:43] into your mind and shake your whole
[33:45] family to shake your whole world by
[33:47] troubling your mind he said or be
[33:49] troubled neither by Spirit nor by word
[33:53] nor by letter as from us as the day of
[33:56] Christ is at hand so he's coming to
[33:58] encourage you amen and he says now look
[34:01] at this but let no man deceive you by
[34:04] any
[34:05] means don't let any person teach you of
[34:08] what God has promised for you brother
[34:10] King he says why for the day shall not
[34:13] come except there come a falling away
[34:16] first and that the man of sin be
[34:18] revealed the son of predition so he
[34:20] tells us that now like Matthew 24 there
[34:23] will have to be a manifestation of the
[34:25] son of man the son of pedition and also
[34:27] the son of man man in the sent of
[34:29] predition now he's going to reject
[34:31] everything that's about God in this hour
[34:33] so he says plainly don't let him deceive
[34:36] you he says why cuz now there's going to
[34:40] be a falling away in the
[34:43] church there's going to be a falling
[34:46] away in people that say they love the
[34:48] Lord there's going to be people that now
[34:50] start off with you and he'll say well
[34:53] you run well he say so who hindered you
[34:57] and he said that the promises there
[34:58] before you who is hindering you this
[35:00] morning from going all the way with the
[35:02] Lord so he says don't be deceived if you
[35:06] don't catch Jesus Christ for yourself
[35:09] then now you might be lost this morning
[35:11] you this morning the individual you have
[35:13] to know yourself that you beyond the
[35:16] shadow of a doubt that God has spoken to
[35:18] your heart and that you've been filled
[35:20] with his holy spirit because when he
[35:22] feels you then he said he's going to
[35:23] bring you because now the voice that
[35:26] you're hearing is not your own it's not
[35:28] the person this person this woman or
[35:30] this radio show but you're now hearing
[35:32] the voice of God speaking to you oh I
[35:35] hope you see this my brother but he says
[35:37] but don't be deceived so you see
[35:40] deception he keeps warning us over and
[35:42] over let me let me just let's keep
[35:44] reading another scripture Galatians just
[35:46] want to drop some before you to get the
[35:48] point across go look at Galatians 6 if
[35:51] you don't get there before I do I'll
[35:52] just read it to you so he says in
[35:54] Galatians 6 he says what be not not
[35:58] deceived God is Not mocked for
[36:01] whatsoever a man sth that he shall reap
[36:05] so he says again don't you think that
[36:07] God is not going to complete every word
[36:10] that he promised everything he says so
[36:13] good or bad is got to come back to you
[36:15] the individual but don't be deceived so
[36:20] he's warning us over and over don't let
[36:24] the devil cheat you now let's look at
[36:26] this my brother sister this another
[36:29] scripture real quick uh let turn over to
[36:31] what I have First
[36:32] Corinthians I just want to read this
[36:34] really
[36:36] quickly now look at this you know it was
[36:38] what's the guy uh he said he's happy
[36:40] happy happy what's the guy name um Duck
[36:44] Dynasty and Paul Roberson remember it
[36:47] was a while back that he got in trouble
[36:49] so to speak uh because he quoted this
[36:52] Bible verse and when he quoted this
[36:54] Bible verse he said that now they were
[36:56] asking about homos uality and he was
[36:59] saying that you know what do you think
[37:00] about homosexuality now he quoted this
[37:03] scripture and you see it got everybody
[37:05] in the Uproar and he did something that
[37:08] uh brother Brook Joe Olin may not do
[37:10] yeah he just he said his belief yeah and
[37:13] he stood on him to say if the word of
[37:15] God says it that's what he said so you
[37:17] see he didn't back up at all but he
[37:20] stayed right with what he said the
[37:22] scripture said now let's make the point
[37:24] what he said he dropped down here and
[37:26] this is what he said I'll just make to
[37:27] make it sure um uh Lord let's see let me
[37:31] just I'll make it verse n know ye not
[37:34] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[37:36] the kingdom of God so let's make this
[37:38] very clear if we're living in sin we're
[37:40] not going to heaven don't fool yourself
[37:42] if you're living in sin you're not going
[37:44] to heaven if you were to die today are
[37:46] you sure you're going to heaven because
[37:48] you see if I wasn't ready to meet God
[37:50] today then it would mean something for
[37:51] me to come to church and say Lord today
[37:54] might be the last day but you see if sin
[37:56] still rest on their heart that you'd
[37:58] rather live in sin then now guess what
[38:01] you're rejecting God one more time and
[38:04] guess who was coming Satan is coming to
[38:06] deceive you again and you see look he
[38:08] said know ye not so let's not make no
[38:10] mistake about it he says be not deceived
[38:15] and it says here plainly that neither
[38:17] fornicators now fornicators you ain't
[38:19] married you haven't s come on now Lord
[38:22] look he said fornication the Bible tells
[38:25] that God killed 23,000 in one day yeah
[38:28] because he hated this act now look if
[38:31] God ha foration he also hate adultery so
[38:34] he says very plainly Paul is saying so
[38:36] to the Corinthian Church he says first
[38:38] he says let's just get this straight
[38:40] you're not going to make it if you
[38:41] fornicate so he had to now he had to
[38:45] make it straight so that people would
[38:47] know so you see if I have my brother say
[38:50] well you know better you can't fornicate
[38:52] you see that if you have a daughter if
[38:54] you have a sister you have a son a wife
[38:56] or Uncle whoever is that when you step
[38:58] outside the word of God do you're not
[39:00] seeing that a sexual lust demon is
[39:03] enticing you to now come and what be
[39:06] part remember Samson was a man of God
[39:09] and as a man of God Samson now when the
[39:12] Philistines came to him they said go to
[39:15] they said theila go to him he's got a
[39:18] Nazarite vow we see the power of God all
[39:20] over so we can't do nothing with him but
[39:22] they sent a woman his way and the woman
[39:25] they sent his way Lord yeah the woman
[39:27] they s his way she said I want you to do
[39:29] this one thing they said go and entice
[39:32] him so you see the enticement now you
[39:35] see brother the B come he said they
[39:37] would never take all the clothes off but
[39:39] they take off just most so you would
[39:41] still have curiosity yeah and you see
[39:44] sin is enticing and you see it wants you
[39:46] to take the next step what is it now
[39:48] today they call it bet but it's still
[39:50] pornography they call it p m MTV but

[44:23] Grace and you're like oh I tell you what
[44:26] we going to get the devil out out of
[44:27] here you see so it take God now to come
[44:31] and do something for you because he's
[44:33] trying to say the two shall become one
[44:35] flesh but you have to be real before God
[44:38] and each other you see he said because
[44:40] you I hope you see God made all of us he
[44:43] said all nothing something that doesn't
[44:44] have emotion is what is dead and God
[44:47] made all of us what he said what that we
[44:49] might Rejoice some May Cry some may weep
[44:51] some may shout some may run but you will
[44:53] do
[44:54] something you'll do something cuz it's
[44:57] God you're a human being amen yeah I
[45:00] think I want you to see now say think
[45:02] for a second uh brother bradam as well
[45:04] as you we all came here one way think
[45:07] about it
[45:09] now I don't think well you know praise
[45:12] the Lord speaking what's going on you
[45:14] know how how we going to have these
[45:17] kids you
[45:19] know now it was a little bit more in it
[45:22] than that cuz you see here now you see
[45:25] it has to be an attraction has to be
[45:26] some fire Paul said can a man take fire
[45:30] into his bosom he didn't say smoke he he
[45:33] said fire brother ke so fire is
[45:35] something burning and if God is shut up
[45:37] in your bones he say it's like
[45:40] fire he say like fire shut up in your
[45:43] bone he said oh son of man can these
[45:45] bones live so he says when these bones
[45:48] when that dead man hit the quickening
[45:49] pads in the bone even he still jumped
[45:51] out the grave because it's still life in
[45:54] them bones in your bones this morning
[45:57] oh Lord not adultery oh see we can't go
[46:00] through all these Lord help us he said
[46:02] no adulterers he said no effeminate so
[46:04] this is what God in trouble he said
[46:06] homosexuality he said now look at this
[46:09] he tried to tell us very clearly he said
[46:11] now this is a manto man woman and a
[46:13] woman right and he says no abusers of
[46:16] them with Mankind and then he says nor
[46:19] thieves or Covetous or drunkers or
[46:21] revivers or extortioners shall inherit
[46:23] the kingdom of God so it's very clear
[46:27] that it's not just homosexual but they
[46:30] took a spin on it but now how can a man
[46:33] go a guy he's on ESPN CN in he's a news
[46:35] anchor he says well I'm a Christian and
[46:38] I'm gay and you say well how can that be
[46:41] if you say you're Christian is right
[46:42] there in the Bible how what are you
[46:44] reading though because he's identified
[46:46] himself as a class of person he hasn't
[46:49] identified it as Sin he identified as
[46:52] the science dictated to me that I'm just
[46:54] a certain kind of person I'm like a
[46:56] white man or black man or Chinese it's
[46:59] just this is how God made it but the
[47:01] Bible says that when God made Adam he
[47:03] took out the real and every feminine
[47:06] part he took it out and he put it in
[47:10] what another
[47:11] vessel so it came be brother Keith not
[47:14] with God
[47:15] separate but now you see it's very plain
[47:18] and all we're asking here is why won't
[47:20] we just let God be God and say what he
[47:23] said well this man didn't have much to I
[47:27] guess lose as they would say he said you
[47:29] guys came to the woods to find me so he
[47:32] stayed on what he said and he says in
[47:35] verse 11 it says and I want you to see
[47:37] what Paul said and such were some of
[47:42] you so hold on
[47:44] now glory to God so why don't they keep
[47:48] reading brother bro why they stop right
[47:51] there it says and such were some of you
[47:53] so in God's house he said there were
[47:56] people people that were homosexual there
[47:58] were people that now live with
[47:59] fornicators there were people that was
[48:01] adulterers they in the house of God now
[48:03] there's something in
[48:05] here oh I hope you see this there's some
[48:08] in here and if you in here now he says
[48:11] now but those that are in there he said
[48:13] such
[48:15] were so there's no way you can come to
[48:17] Christ and stay that way my brother
[48:20] there's no way he said now you believe
[48:22] the word of God he said you were that
[48:24] way and he says and now he says but ye
[48:28] are what
[48:30] wased when he wased you so he had to now
[48:34] me he had to come and get that off you
[48:36] and get that off you and get that off
[48:38] you and you
[48:39] see you see you
[48:41] was to be wise you got to stand still to
[48:45] be wise you got to stand still for a
[48:47] minute how is God going to move if you
[48:49] don't stand still for a minute if you
[48:51] want God to do something in your life
[48:53] stand still for a minute and let God do
[48:55] something he said when you don't know
[48:56] exactly what to do don't do nothing just
[48:59] wait on God because when youve done all
[49:01] to stand he says stand therefore he said
[49:04] what your La is guarded he said what
[49:06] because God is the one that is keeping
[49:08] you and you are not even standing it's
[49:10] by the spirit of God that he picked you
[49:13] up and he saids you're standing on dry
[49:15] ground Solid Ground when they went
[49:18] through that Red Sea it wasn't muddy sir
[49:21] millions and millions of gallons of

[51:47] and I ask you this morning if we're
[51:49] going to be if we've been watched if
[51:51] we've now been to the place that he said
[51:53] we were deceived but now God has done
[51:56] something the for does it not mean
[51:58] something to you to go share with
[52:00] somebody else am you see there's people
[52:03] that are still deceived and I want you
[52:05] to think you remember like just think
[52:06] for a second uh Jose Jehoshaphat
[52:08] remember when Jehoshaphat was down there
[52:10] with uh Ahab and he said they were going
[52:12] to go to war and it says that when in
[52:15] making a decision he said let's be one
[52:17] people let's we we can all be one Army
[52:19] we share the same Army same resources
[52:20] everything right but it was something in
[52:23] Ahab that now it says he said there's
[52:25] one man that I believe that hates me and
[52:28] after he heard that lying Spirit
[52:30] remember it was a deceiving spirit that
[52:32] was sent that went was before God's
[52:34] Throne that left the Throne of God and
[52:36] he went down and said you'll be a lying
[52:39] spirit in the midst of four in the mouth
[52:41] of 400 other preachers they were on
[52:43] Earth at that time so if God allowed it
[52:46] then he can allow it now amen 400 and
[52:49] there's only one man Hallelujah only one
[52:52] man that can tell the truth and the king
[52:54] of Israel that's on the throne he turned
[52:56] around and said I just I I know he one
[52:58] more man and he said but I don't want to
[53:00] hear what he got to
[53:02] say because he I he hates me and
[53:06] everything he says is just evil
[53:07] concerning me but you ever ask why won't
[53:10] he repent and you see when you come and
[53:13] you come to the Lord the Lord does with
[53:14] you does something in your life and
[53:16] changes your life then people around you
[53:18] they start to get jealous because now
[53:20] what they're saying really is is you
[53:22] think that you're somebody now and all
[53:25] you want to do is share the same Grace
[53:28] with them that God gave you that's all
[53:31] you want to do and you see but it was
[53:33] something I hope you catch in this story
[53:36] there was something about it that was in
[53:39] the heart of Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat
[53:41] told Ahab he said oh let the king not
[53:44] say so go ahead and let the man come and
[53:47] when he came he says oh what you want he
[53:49] said well I'm hearing what the other
[53:51] preacher saying they said go take the
[53:52] land go out be blessed right God is
[53:54] going to do something for you I'm
[53:56] reaching to the TV right now just
[53:58] sending a million dollars right now and
[53:59] God going to do something for you I'm
[54:01] telling you the blessings on the way oh
[54:03] how what what what's the interpretation
[54:06] send more money look at it now I'm
[54:09] telling you that's what they do it said
[54:11] Li spirit I saw this thing God they had
[54:14] this church they were singing this song
[54:15] I command my hands to praise the Lord
[54:18] yall ever heard that song then they said
[54:20] I command my pockets to praise the Lord
[54:23] and they had the men go out and get the
[54:24] get the plates and he said okay they
[54:27] came up and people started giving money
[54:29] in the plates and then they kept playing
[54:31] mus he said now he says the guy looked
[54:33] at he said we need to command more
[54:35] Pockets play one more time I command my
[54:39] pocket I'm telling you so now you see
[54:41] that how the devil does he said it's a
[54:43] pool now and it's a lying spirit that
[54:46] goes now into the mouth and he's trying
[54:48] to get something but he's not getting
[54:50] the people to Christ well you see
[54:52] Jehoshaphat it was something deep down
[54:54] Randy that now touched him and what
[54:56] touched him was he said oh well you know
[54:58] what he said let that King say so it got
[55:01] to be somebody else now I ask you what
[55:04] came into his heart what was there that
[55:08] now was in Jehoshaphat that made him
[55:11] just cry out and say there's got to be
[55:14] one more amen now look it was something
[55:17] that you can't explain it's something
[55:19] that he couldn't
[55:21] explain because oh Lord I got you see he
[55:24] was in Covenant with you already but now
[55:26] he comes and he says he he prophesies
[55:29] and he says oh you know go and go do
[55:31] what everybody else says he said no now
[55:33] Ahab stops and says tell the truth see
[55:37] even he knew that now it wasn't right
[55:41] but you see he still needed
[55:42] jehoshaphat's help and you see he was
[55:44] laying there because he wanted to
[55:45] deceive Jehoshaphat and you know the
[55:48] story as they go to war it says they go
[55:51] forth to war and now guess what as
[55:53] they're out there Jehoshaphat who was
[55:55] tricked he had on ahab's garments he's
[55:58] going there and he cries out and what do
[56:00] you hear oh Lord help me and now the
[56:03] very same Prophecy of the arrow that
[56:05] went forth that kills him the prophecy
[56:07] comes true and now here comes a seed of
[56:10] God who couldn't be deceived because God
[56:13] now came in and he had mercy it was a
[56:16] man that feared god with his heart it
[56:18] was a man that walked before him and his
[56:21] ways was perfect it was a man that told
[56:24] the people we could just humble our said
[56:27] under the mighty hand of God in turn of
[56:29] my Wicked way that God would come and he
[56:32] said what he would hear our prayer he
[56:35] wasn't deceived and I want you to see
[56:38] here today God doesn't want us to be
[56:40] deceived if we take the promise turn I I
[56:44] want to just I want to just read
[56:46] something to you really quick uh oh Lord
[56:49] let me just read something let me read
[56:51] something to you Lord help me I got to
[56:54] pull it up I got I I almost think I
[56:56] might might need to print this thing
[57:00] out it's
[57:03] uh now look at uh let me see
[57:07] here must read two things in here just
[57:09] two things now I want you to see here
[57:11] something at the end
[57:14] time in the end time God's message to
[57:18] the people at the end time has always
[57:21] been one of
[57:23] delivered now I want you to think about
[57:25] that for a second hallah in Noah's day
[57:28] Hallelujah Before the Flood came God
[57:32] spoke to Noah and he built the ark and
[57:36] what he did when he built this Ark he
[57:38] said we know there was one way in one
[57:39] way out and he gave the word to one man
[57:42] had him preach a preacher righteous for
[57:44] 120 years and now it was only something
[57:47] in now who his family and in animals to
[57:51] get into Christ so God now put something
[57:56] in mankind if he can put in an animal
[57:59] then God could put something in you so
[58:02] that you would know when the end time
[58:04] comes that now you better get ready so
[58:07] God has put a seed there I hope you see
[58:10] and it's always been that before it
[58:12] comes down remember Jo remember Jericho
[58:14] when them walls came down how were they
[58:16] going to get those walls to come down if
[58:19] they were running chariot races around
[58:20] these walls how could it get them fall
[58:22] down well you know what God said
[58:24] somebody grow and start praising me amen
[58:26] after seven days of going around the
[58:29] seventh day go around seven times and he
[58:31] said go get a trumpet and all you got to
[58:33] do is start praising God and he said all
[58:36] them thick walls of Life of issue they
[58:39] come down because at the appointed time
[58:42] you start praising God you see that was
[58:45] God doing something for his people so
[58:49] you see here what is God telling us he
[58:51] said now there's bombs with Russ B
[58:53] Russia has bombs with our names on and
[58:56] before any bomb would ever hit the
[58:58] United States now I want you to see this
[59:01] 58 to God but now this
[59:03] 2014 and now he said Russia has bombs
[59:07] with our names on and they can hit the
[59:09] button at any time and now there's
[59:11] issues in Ukraine and criteria and now
[59:13] we're seeing here that now what is God
[59:15] doing he's holding back the angel of the
[59:18] Lord is holding it back only to get
[59:20] somebody else
[59:22] in he's holding it back it's a message
[59:25] of Deliverance
[59:27] you see why he said don't be deceived
[59:29] for God is Not mocked God don't give a
[59:32] word and then he can't feel it so you
[59:34] see we got to look at the times we've
[59:37] had like just four blood moons remember
[59:39] they said I was looking at it you said n
[59:40] 1492 from Christopher Columbus then you
[59:42] look at 59 to 1967 is become a nation
[59:46] it's now
[59:47] 2014 and God now he said there the son
[59:50] will turn to Darkness he said the moon
[59:51] shall turn to blood and now what do we
[59:54] see there's signs in the heaven that God
[59:56] is moving again every time you see it oh
[59:59] I hope you see it every time it was God
[1:00:02] doing something for his people the Jews
[1:00:04] cuz he said I would never forget Israel
[1:00:07] so he said but all he says Israel is not
[1:00:09] Israel but there in in Christ no Jew nor
[1:00:13] Greek Bond nor free male nor female for
[1:00:16] All In Christ are one so the seed been
[1:00:20] planted and the seed now he say it's
[1:00:22] moving by the power of God it's
[1:00:24] something quicker than the seed say wake
[1:00:26] up and see be ye not deceived don't be
[1:00:29] cheated you say you see the thing that
[1:00:32] God has prepared us it hasn't even
[1:00:33] entered to your mind the thing that God
[1:00:36] has before you it hasn't even entered
[1:00:38] into your spirit your heart your soul
[1:00:39] it's not even entered in so right now
[1:00:42] it's about can the son of man come and
[1:00:44] find Faith amen can he find Faith right
[1:00:47] now in this place is enough Faith to
[1:00:50] know that you say to my neighbor Jesus
[1:00:52] Christ is here in this
[1:00:54] church if you could just come with any
[1:00:56] element God can heal you all you got to
[1:00:59] do is have faith how do you know because
[1:01:01] Jesus Christ
[1:01:02] promised and then what else do you need
[1:01:05] yeah you ain't deep it ain't got to be
[1:01:06] deep because he promised and you see the
[1:01:09] Promise it brings forth It's greater
[1:01:11] than the problem if you look at the
[1:01:13] promise is always bigger than the
[1:01:14] problem but we focus on the problem so
[1:01:17] much that we miss what the promise is
[1:01:19] saying amen look oh look let me I guess
[1:01:21] gota read I gotta read something to you
[1:01:23] oh Lord uh Lord let me let me put like
[1:01:27] this listen let me read this to you if
[1:01:29] his children us today the children of
[1:01:31] God and we will only take his word so he
[1:01:35] can prove it by
[1:01:37] you if we would only take his word he
[1:01:41] would prove it by us this morning amen
[1:01:44] so he's not looking for someone else but
[1:01:46] God wants to prove his word by someone
[1:01:48] in this building today so proving it he
[1:01:51] says that's the only way he can prove
[1:01:53] his word if you see if you get sick how
[1:01:57] can God prove he's a Healer unless
[1:01:59] somebody gets sick and now he they have
[1:02:01] enough Faith to believe that Jesus
[1:02:03] Christ heals how else can he prove that
[1:02:05] he's a Healer today but you see if that
[1:02:07] person don't have faith and we don't
[1:02:09] have sometime even faith for them then
[1:02:11] how can God show he's a
[1:02:12] Healer he already he said it's finished
[1:02:15] so look but he said he doesn't prove it
[1:02:19] to
[1:02:20] unbelief
[1:02:22] now see that's kind of heavy to see that
[1:02:25] God wants to prove himself but God ain't
[1:02:27] no clown and he holds it back he says
[1:02:30] they can't be proved they are
[1:02:33] unbelievers but it's not to
[1:02:36] unbelievers it's for it's not for
[1:02:39] unbelievers it's to him that believe
[1:02:43] amen and if he can find somebody who
[1:02:46] will believe his word he will prove his
[1:02:49] word by
[1:02:51] you oh glory to God and sometimes
[1:02:55] sickness and things things happens to us
[1:02:57] that way that God can prove himself God
[1:03:00] wants to prove himself and I just ask
[1:03:03] you today will we let him prove himself
[1:03:05] amen if we know that he said we can't
[1:03:07] even be lost he says if we are his elect
[1:03:10] seed that now here he comes how do we
[1:03:12] know because when the Holy Spirit drops
[1:03:15] down on the sea you'll recognize the
[1:03:17] word for your day amen let's make it
[1:03:19] very plain remember he said here in John
[1:03:22] 8 when Jesus was speaking to the
[1:03:24] Pharisees and Sadducees they were
[1:03:26] claiming that they were the seeds of
[1:03:28] Abraham when you talk to most people
[1:03:29] that say they're Christian they all say
[1:03:30] that they believe God they say they love
[1:03:32] Jesus and they say that they think
[1:03:33] they're going to heaven all all is well
[1:03:35] right but now when Jesus spoke to them
[1:03:38] he looked that beyond what they were
[1:03:39] saying he looked in their heart when he
[1:03:42] look at their heart he saw that they
[1:03:43] were rejecting him and when by them
[1:03:46] rejecting him they were not just
[1:03:49] rejecting Jesus they were rejecting God
[1:03:51] Amen because it was God in him the
[1:03:54] fullness of God in him so in him dwell
[1:03:57] the fullness of God had B so here he is
[1:03:59] and now he's standing there and I ask
[1:04:01] you if they rejected Jesus who else was
[1:04:05] going to come and preach to them and
[1:04:06] they
[1:04:08] believe the signs and wonders he did
[1:04:11] walked on water raised the dead he said
[1:04:15] which one of you can what say that I'm
[1:04:17] unbelief can say that there unbelief in
[1:04:19] me what sin do you see in me you can't
[1:04:22] condemn me of sin so he says this and he
[1:04:24] looks beyond them and he says you are of
[1:04:27] your father the
[1:04:29] devil now that's some heavy words sir
[1:04:32] for God now you see for God to look and
[1:04:35] say you are of your father the devil
[1:04:38] then who's their
[1:04:39] father you see you see this is very
[1:04:42] plain this is God speaking to you and
[1:04:44] he's saying that you I ain't he said
[1:04:45] you're not my
[1:04:47] child come on because he said the seed
[1:04:51] would always do what he said if you was
[1:04:53] Abraham's seed you would Rejoice to see
[1:04:55] my day so then you say where's the
[1:04:59] rejoicing where's the rejoicing of what
[1:05:01] God has done he said but the reason you
[1:05:04] can't understand is because what he said
[1:05:06] because my word has no place in
[1:05:10] you now come on now he says so if the
[1:05:13] word of God doesn't have place in
[1:05:14] somebody there's no magnet there's no
[1:05:16] attraction if you put a magnet to
[1:05:18] aluminum there's no pull but you put
[1:05:20] that on a good heavy maybe piece of
[1:05:22] Steel before you get
[1:05:24] by it comes right to because there an
[1:05:27] attraction Jesus said the words I speak
[1:05:30] he said the flesh profited nothing but
[1:05:32] the words I speak unto you they are
[1:05:34] spirit and they are life so the word of
[1:05:37] God he's moving see God's Moving Like a
[1:05:39] Man and he's moving now he's looking for
[1:05:42] the seed and remember it won't be much
[1:05:44] time so when it starts moving over it
[1:05:46] says what it starts picking up one here
[1:05:48] picking up one there picking up one
[1:05:50] there he says why because there's an
[1:05:52] attraction there he is the mountain and
[1:05:55] I want you to see this won't be much
[1:05:57] longer I want you to look at this with
[1:05:59] me just really quick you asked the
[1:06:02] question let's look at uh First Kings
[1:06:05] you ask the question you say when you
[1:06:07] look in the Bible you say so Brother
[1:06:09] Kyle how is it that that woman I mean
[1:06:12] that
[1:06:13] Jehoshaphat how did she how did he know
[1:06:17] pause how did he
[1:06:19] know how did he know because it was
[1:06:23] something laying beneath he said that's
[1:06:25] skin and I just want you to see this
[1:06:28] with me just for a second just a look at
[1:06:30] this remember there's a story in the
[1:06:32] Bible First Kings 17 that there was a
[1:06:35] drought and God had a man of God in the
[1:06:37] scene called Elijah the Tish and
[1:06:40] remember before when the drought came
[1:06:42] the drought came because it was spoken
[1:06:43] by his word and he said that there'll be
[1:06:46] neither due nor rain he says and he said
[1:06:48] until I call for it and it was three and
[1:06:51] a half years he said that everything
[1:06:53] stopped and everything stopped why
[1:06:55] because the son of man on Earth called
[1:06:58] for this prophet of God I don't if you
[1:07:01] see this so when he called for he said
[1:07:03] it has to stop so he was now the Bible
[1:07:05] says that he went when he called for the
[1:07:08] famine that then he went and he went by
[1:07:10] the Brook of chair and by the Brook of
[1:07:12] cheriff he said he was there and he said
[1:07:15] I'm God spoke to him and said I'm going
[1:07:17] to feed you and he said I'm going to
[1:07:20] send an Unfaithful bird a bird that
[1:07:22] don't even take care of his young I'm
[1:07:24] going to give an unbeliever on your
[1:07:26] job and he said somebody don't care
[1:07:28] nothing about you hate your guts and he
[1:07:31] said I'm going to use him to help bless
[1:07:32] you and he says he says I'm going what
[1:07:35] I'm going to do is he said I'm going to
[1:07:37] have this bird feed you every day so
[1:07:41] there was a famine but now he was by
[1:07:43] Brook and he's by Brook and he's still
[1:07:45] drinking brother and now he's eating
[1:07:48] brother Keith and he's having a good
[1:07:49] time but there's a famine in the land
[1:07:51] amen now in this famine the Bible says
[1:07:53] that he was eating good maybe getting
[1:07:56] with the Lord having prayer time the
[1:07:57] Lord that God was still blessing his son
[1:07:59] of man but now something comes up the
[1:08:03] Bible said that the brook dried up yeah
[1:08:06] now when the Brooks of Life dry up
[1:08:08] remember he where would he go and just
[1:08:10] go get something to eat and drink where
[1:08:12] could he go it was no place else to go
[1:08:15] but when it dried up Ruby it was like
[1:08:18] now he's sitting there and now he had to
[1:08:20] wait to hear from God Amen see God told
[1:08:23] him to go there and before he could
[1:08:25] leave God had to tell him to
[1:08:27] leave I hope you see this so you see
[1:08:30] that's why we as see Servants of God we
[1:08:33] want to be led by his Spirit now
[1:08:35] remember he said those that are led by
[1:08:36] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:08:39] God you see so now when the brook drives
[1:08:42] up I want you I'm just trying to save a
[1:08:43] little time look where he goes he goes
[1:08:44] from charith and now the Bible say he
[1:08:47] said arise and get thee to zerath which
[1:08:49] belongeth to zidon so now he goes to the
[1:08:53] place where uh um Jezebel is from yeah
[1:08:56] he must to go all the way where Jezebel
[1:08:58] is and now remember it says historically
[1:09:01] is about maybe 75 miles from charedi to
[1:09:05] zerath and zerath it means now you see
[1:09:09] zerath was a place it was very Wicked
[1:09:11] remember Jezebel this where this is her
[1:09:13] Homeland and this prophet of God after
[1:09:16] drinking and eating all he had left he
[1:09:18] had to now go 75 miles to
[1:09:22] zarapa 75 miles remember it wasn't no
[1:09:25] Lexus it was no airplane was no
[1:09:27] helicopters you know it was get on the
[1:09:30] donkey or get on the get on your to get
[1:09:32] on Pat and
[1:09:34] turn Pat every Pat your feet turn the
[1:09:36] corner amen he had to get going amen so
[1:09:39] 75 miles ain't no quick journey and you
[1:09:41] better know that you remember it's a
[1:09:43] family in land and you better know
[1:09:45] wherever you go that God is going to
[1:09:47] keep you so you see even though he saw
[1:09:50] everything dried up it was something in
[1:09:52] him that said you know what since God
[1:09:54] told me to go
[1:09:56] I got to go here so as he started W as
[1:10:00] he started going he gets down to this
[1:10:02] place and you see he's only listening to
[1:10:04] the spoken word of God and he has to
[1:10:07] trust that voice just like we got to
[1:10:08] trust that Voice Hallelujah we have to
[1:10:10] trust the same what the voice of the
[1:10:13] word for your day that it'll bring you
[1:10:15] to the right place now everything in the
[1:10:18] land is starting to dry up you say
[1:10:20] currency is worth nothing you see come
[1:10:23] on now look at all look at the debt they
[1:10:24] showing kickers and all you see that
[1:10:26] going up right so when who's going to
[1:10:28] bring it
[1:10:29] down come on now billionaires can't get
[1:10:33] us out this the interest the interest so
[1:10:37] you see when you're in a a big hole it
[1:10:40] takes somebody with a big shovel to get
[1:10:41] you out am and you see see money it
[1:10:44] ain't vaporized it went somewhere but
[1:10:46] the person who's holding it it's going
[1:10:47] to cost you something oh I can help you
[1:10:49] out you know I can I I got you but Adam
[1:10:53] I can take care of you but it's going to
[1:10:54] CAU you amen you see nothing he say no
[1:10:57] such thing as a free lunch so you see
[1:10:59] here here we are it says he's going to
[1:11:01] this place and he knows that it's sin in
[1:11:04] this place he knows it's wickedness in
[1:11:06] this place but God is leading him amen
[1:11:09] when he gets down to this place this
[1:11:10] place of zerath is a place now of
[1:11:13] smelting that means it's a place now
[1:11:15] where God has to apply pressure yes sir
[1:11:17] a place where God has to apply heat and
[1:11:20] he has to send his Prophet there yeah
[1:11:22] and remember see when he goes down there
[1:11:25] the Bible says that now there was a
[1:11:27] woman down there and I want you to see
[1:11:30] this woman down here it says she she was
[1:11:33] a widow woman and all she had was a
[1:11:35] little son her husband had passed and
[1:11:38] she was Raising this child by herself
[1:11:40] and in raising this child y'all it's
[1:11:42] like she was experiencing the same now
[1:11:45] things that everybody else was seeing it
[1:11:47] was hard to get those kids get them up
[1:11:50] and get them go to school in the morning
[1:11:51] it was hard to now sit there and pray
[1:11:53] with him at night because he had hunger
[1:11:55] p yeah it was hard because you see as
[1:11:57] the famine came on it said that as she
[1:11:59] was eating he was eating too but she had
[1:12:01] to eat less just to make sure he'd be
[1:12:03] okay and she had to now maybe take on a
[1:12:06] lot less just so she could provide for
[1:12:08] her son and she only had
[1:12:11] one so you see it was God putting two
[1:12:15] people in a pressure point he putting
[1:12:17] two people now in the crock pot and now
[1:12:20] as they're on two different extremes God
[1:12:21] is now bringing them to the same two
[1:12:24] omnipotence he has to make them meat
[1:12:26] because it's a famine now I want you to
[1:12:29] think about something now during the
[1:12:31] famine even though things got tight he
[1:12:34] was eating and she was
[1:12:37] eating I hope you see this now they were
[1:12:39] both eating so you may not be eating a
[1:12:42] lot this morning but you'll be
[1:12:44] eating but you you got to because he
[1:12:47] said there's always light in Ghost and
[1:12:50] God came and he said I had to provide
[1:12:52] because my seed is down there it's a
[1:12:55] Jesus said there were many widows in the
[1:12:57] land but God only sent Elijah to this
[1:12:59] one woman so it must be something
[1:13:03] special about her it must be something
[1:13:05] that maybe that she can grab a hold of
[1:13:07] that everybody can't grab a hold of it
[1:13:09] must be something that'll quick in her
[1:13:10] heart that maybe it doesn't Quicken
[1:13:12] everybody's heart it must be something
[1:13:14] about the word of God that she believed
[1:13:16] in that she Feast on that was different
[1:13:18] than what the whole nominal world was
[1:13:20] saying because it provided for her when
[1:13:23] everybody else started even eating their
[1:13:24] own babies when everybody else was going
[1:13:27] into adultery and fornication and this
[1:13:29] it says be not deceived she held on to
[1:13:33] the god of Abraham the god of Jacob the
[1:13:36] god of Isaac she knew that that's my God
[1:13:39] too and you see something in her heart
[1:13:42] she started crying out and God said you
[1:13:45] know what I got to now go and send my
[1:13:48] Prophet to this woman because and he
[1:13:51] tells he tells him he said go to zath
[1:13:54] for there's a a widow woman there that's
[1:13:57] going to sustain
[1:13:58] me so it's a woman that set her life
[1:14:02] aside because even though her husband
[1:14:05] was gone she decided to now stay true
[1:14:09] because now all she had was her
[1:14:12] son and she said this is enough God can
[1:14:15] provide for me oh I hope you see this so
[1:14:19] as she's standing there as she's up
[1:14:21] there maybe one day and it was maybe
[1:14:23] getting down to as the Bible tell us the
[1:14:25] last little bit of everything and if
[1:14:28] you've ever been down to your last
[1:14:29] little bit it ain't a fun thing it's
[1:14:32] very nerve wck because you see if you
[1:14:35] start a job and then you get the new job
[1:14:38] it takes three weeks but the rent is due
[1:14:40] at the end of the
[1:14:41] week for you one week in the whole and
[1:14:44] what are you going to do for the other
[1:14:45] two weeks but then now guess what it's
[1:14:47] the beginning of month so the cell phone
[1:14:50] do and guess what the light be so which
[1:14:53] one you going to pay
[1:14:55] well if they turn my
[1:14:57] lights boy I don't know what I'm gonna
[1:14:58] do but I tell I need my cell phone
[1:15:00] because I like the text
[1:15:02] message come on
[1:15:04] hey come on see there's some taxes in
[1:15:07] here TX but you can turn my lights
[1:15:10] off oh yeah man I had a guy one time
[1:15:13] invite him in church he was saying that
[1:15:14] man you know K he said I think he gonna
[1:15:16] turn my lights off the day I said why
[1:15:17] don't you come to church then well I
[1:15:19] think I just sit home in the dark I said
[1:15:21] well my brother we got lights in the
[1:15:23] church you know what I'm saying why you
[1:15:25] just going to sit in the D you see it
[1:15:28] don't make no sense but then you ask
[1:15:31] people have so many excuses when it
[1:15:33] comes to re receiving now the word you
[1:15:36] say why when the pope was speaking that
[1:15:39] message to the world he said his message
[1:15:42] was called let us be
[1:15:45] light and he said he asked he this is
[1:15:47] what he said to the entire world and
[1:15:49] he's speaking down to the individuals
[1:15:51] saying to the individuals we have to be
[1:15:54] something yeah and now I I hope you
[1:15:57] would see that in Goan oh Lord this come
[1:16:00] this is where this woman was away from
[1:16:03] everybody but yet she's still sitting
[1:16:05] here now and God is shining on her
[1:16:08] because he's providing for her look what
[1:16:12] happened her faith had to be something
[1:16:15] to attract this prophet and when he
[1:16:17] comes to her just think maybe she's
[1:16:19] going out there by the gate that morning
[1:16:21] and she sees a man she looks out say
[1:16:24] this man all scruffy kind of beard maybe
[1:16:27] hair all matted up he got a little stick
[1:16:29] like
[1:16:31] this and think Lo maybe a little honey
[1:16:34] on them maybe a little fish and he's
[1:16:36] sitting there see the woman woman don't
[1:16:39] know her he don't they don't know each
[1:16:42] other
[1:16:43] woman he says go ahead and fetch me hold
[1:16:46] on now sister some of y'all say fetch
[1:16:52] fetch you know who I am fetch
[1:16:55] do you know come on now let me some of
[1:16:57] y'all mean hold hold on let me read it
[1:16:59] he says woman fetch me I pray thee a
[1:17:03] little water in a vessel and he said
[1:17:05] that I may
[1:17:06] drink so now it was go get me something
[1:17:09] to drink hold on I don't even know you
[1:17:12] you asking me it's a famine where I'm
[1:17:14] going to get you something to drink for
[1:17:16] so if all this stays in her mind and it
[1:17:19] enters into her heart then she doesn't
[1:17:21] really know that she could be
[1:17:23] entertaining an Angel UNA the way
[1:17:25] but you see deep down in there something
[1:17:28] had to stop and say there something
[1:17:31] about that voice I can't explain it but
[1:17:34] it's something about the voice fetch me
[1:17:36] a little water now she maybe she said
[1:17:39] well I can get them a little water there
[1:17:41] a little water over there and I think by
[1:17:44] the you know by the stove I can get him
[1:17:45] some water so she turns May goes to get
[1:17:48] him some water but going to give him
[1:17:51] some water he speaks again and you see
[1:17:55] sometimes as we walk in this Christian
[1:17:56] Journey God will tell you something he
[1:17:58] may say he brother he say come to this
[1:18:00] place out or if he tell you go to hour
[1:18:03] he when you get there I also need you to
[1:18:04] do something else Lord I'm I'm just
[1:18:06] trying to get the hour come on now you
[1:18:09] know I Lord I need a job okay let get
[1:18:12] job okay when you get the job now I need
[1:18:13] to go tell this person that you know
[1:18:15] they need to get stop living in sin well
[1:18:17] Lord hold on Lord I need a
[1:18:19] job hold on God now you see he does
[1:18:23] these kind of things and after he told
[1:18:25] her to get the water then he said hold
[1:18:28] on the Bible said as she was going to
[1:18:31] fetch it so she took the word and she
[1:18:33] acted on it and in doing it he called to
[1:18:36] her bring me I pray thee he says a
[1:18:39] morcel of bread in thy hand hold on hold
[1:18:42] on he didn't say meal he didn't say oil
[1:18:45] he didn't say the ingredients he said
[1:18:47] bring me some bread so what he really
[1:18:50] asked for is I want you to go in your
[1:18:52] house I want you to do something for him
[1:18:55] and she says to her I just got to read
[1:18:57] it to you it says and she said as the
[1:19:00] Lord thy God liveth now she begins now
[1:19:03] to talk back before the water I can do
[1:19:07] but now let me tell you my situation man
[1:19:10] of God he says I have not a cake and but
[1:19:14] a handful of meal and a bear and a
[1:19:15] little oil and a cruise and behold I am
[1:19:18] Gathering two sticks I may go in and
[1:19:19] dress it for me and my son that we may
[1:19:22] eat it and die
[1:19:25] so he told ISAC the situation and the
[1:19:28] situation was I can get you some water
[1:19:31] but in my cupboard all I have is a
[1:19:34] little bit of meal and oil now we know
[1:19:37] the meal was Christ the oil was the Holy
[1:19:39] Spirit but we see here that she looked
[1:19:42] at her natural substance and as she
[1:19:45] looked at she said now this is all I got
[1:19:48] and I'm going to feed my little son now
[1:19:51] the situation was if her son didn't eat
[1:19:54] this last meal then it would be she'd be
[1:19:57] finished anyway cuz it was nowhere to
[1:19:59] turn but she looked and she said man of
[1:20:02] God I got something said she had to tell
[1:20:06] her
[1:20:06] situation now the Bible said if you ask
[1:20:09] you shall receive seek and ye shall find
[1:20:13] then he said knock and it shall be open
[1:20:15] unto you now she didn't know who she was
[1:20:17] talking to but she said I got to tell
[1:20:20] you my situation now after she tells the
[1:20:24] man of God her situation glory to God
[1:20:26] she says and Elijah said unto her fear
[1:20:29] not so first let's get all the unbelief
[1:20:32] out the way this morning all the
[1:20:35] unbelief has to get out of your heart
[1:20:36] before you can see God that means that
[1:20:39] it can't be nothing between your mind
[1:20:40] your heart your soul and your savior
[1:20:43] amen it's just you in Christ and he says
[1:20:45] fear not the man of God says go and do
[1:20:47] as thou has said but make me there a
[1:20:50] cake a little cake first and bring it
[1:20:52] unto me and make it for thee and for thy
[1:20:54] son hold on now she said but it's only
[1:20:57] enough for one
[1:20:58] biscuit now I want you to see she been
[1:21:01] sharing everything but at this point now
[1:21:05] I want you to see that it has to be
[1:21:07] something special about this woman there
[1:21:11] were many other people that cuz look at
[1:21:13] this the Bible tells in the end day
[1:21:15] there'll be many false Christ to arve
[1:21:18] and the false Christ arise how did this
[1:21:20] woman not know this was a a a a false
[1:21:23] prophet how did did she not know that he
[1:21:25] was coming to eat her bread and eat her
[1:21:28] son's bread and then go to the next
[1:21:29] neighbor's house how did she know that
[1:21:32] and then now as she started getting
[1:21:34] watered she told the situation now this
[1:21:35] man is telling her go ahead and get me
[1:21:38] something
[1:21:39] first so what he really asked her he
[1:21:44] said believe that I'm a man of God and
[1:21:48] after you first believe that I'm a man
[1:21:50] of God he said don't have fear cuz I
[1:21:53] didn't come here to hurt but he says as
[1:21:56] I came here I want you to serve me first
[1:22:00] remember he didn't say nothing about the
[1:22:01] Lord yet oh he said I want you to go in
[1:22:04] your house and give me something first
[1:22:07] yeah remember he said remember when it's
[1:22:09] like in uh Second Chronicles 24 remember
[1:22:11] when uh who who was that um down there
[1:22:13] when they had Jo joash remember joash
[1:22:16] when he when he got to become the king
[1:22:18] that they put a chest outside the gate
[1:22:21] and everybody they kept coming to the
[1:22:22] city they would keep pouring into what
[1:22:24] the chest yes and he was now the young
[1:22:26] king he reigned when he was 7 years old
[1:22:28] remember and 7 years old he reigned for
[1:22:30] like 40 years and he came down to joash
[1:22:33] when it came all the way down to it that
[1:22:35] when he became king that jeod was the
[1:22:38] one that built him up he was the one
[1:22:40] that now he was the priest that
[1:22:41] strengthened himself and put him on the
[1:22:43] throne but then the Bible says that
[1:22:46] after jeod died that when he died then
[1:22:49] the princes of Judah came unto him and
[1:22:52] they got joash to what turn his heart
[1:22:54] away from the Lord and the very same
[1:22:57] thing that he went to build that he
[1:22:58] labored for that he put into the chest
[1:23:00] that he brought a cups and ornaments for
[1:23:03] the house of God and to rebuild the
[1:23:05] Temple of God it became nothing because
[1:23:08] what did he do he went back and then now
[1:23:11] he made Idols to him he became an
[1:23:13] idul and now the Bible says that when
[1:23:16] the son of jeho di the one that man that
[1:23:19] had been so good to him lived 130 years
[1:23:21] when that man he came his son came up he
[1:23:24] said the spirit of God moved on
[1:23:25] Zachariah yeah and when the spirit of
[1:23:27] God moved he told him he said he said
[1:23:29] look he said look why are y'all doing
[1:23:31] what y'all doing he said why don't you
[1:23:34] turn back to the Lord and the Bible said
[1:23:36] they sent Prophet at the prophets and
[1:23:37] the Bible said they would not hear them
[1:23:39] cuz they were caught up in they have
[1:23:41] been deceived and then being deceived
[1:23:44] now what they do the Bible said that the
[1:23:45] people rose up and they could they they
[1:23:47] conjur them on themselves they took
[1:23:49] stones and they killed them and Jesus
[1:23:51] comes later and he says he said that the
[1:23:54] blood
[1:23:55] he said of righteous Abel and the blood
[1:23:58] of Zachariah he said that very blood is
[1:24:01] going to now be on your heads because he
[1:24:04] said now you're the one that what you
[1:24:06] made the you you took the tombs and you
[1:24:08] made them beautiful and you garnished
[1:24:10] the seacus and he says but you never
[1:24:12] ever believe my word so he was
[1:24:14] identifying that spirit all the way then
[1:24:17] to now and you see this woman has to
[1:24:20] look past all the falseness all the
[1:24:23] things that are not like God
[1:24:24] and something has to drop down and know
[1:24:27] that that's a man of God now I want you
[1:24:29] to see this now so here she standing and
[1:24:33] as she's standing here in this place it
[1:24:35] saids that when she looks at him and she
[1:24:37] goes to get the cake she something now
[1:24:40] has to move in her to look past her
[1:24:43] situation and she had to look past her
[1:24:46] starving son amen now once you see this
[1:24:49] this ain't this ain't no light thing if
[1:24:51] you got a child and they're starving now
[1:24:54] to the bones cuz you see at that point
[1:24:56] when starvation said s ribs start
[1:24:58] showing you know bone all this the
[1:25:01] diaphragm everything everything starts
[1:25:03] showing your rib cage so you see she was
[1:25:05] seeing her son in this condition she saw
[1:25:08] many flies around his head she saw maybe
[1:25:10] him getting up moaning about stomach
[1:25:12] cramps moaning about Lord what is you
[1:25:14] going to do for us she heard her mom
[1:25:17] praying but she didn't he never saw
[1:25:18] anything happen and I want you to see it
[1:25:21] had to be something in this woman to
[1:25:24] look P her son amen and say that this
[1:25:27] man of God yeah I need to now go take
[1:25:31] the meal I have take the oil I have and
[1:25:34] I need to now go get some two sticks
[1:25:37] some fire and I need to go make a cake
[1:25:39] for this
[1:25:41] man something dropped down and it was in
[1:25:44] the seed that was there now when the
[1:25:47] whole when the word of God came now he
[1:25:51] sits there and as the woman goes to make
[1:25:53] the meal the of God looks at this woman
[1:25:55] and he says he says woman let me tell
[1:25:58] you something he says thus saith the
[1:26:01] Lord amen now remember the Bible says
[1:26:03] see he said the Greeks to after wisdom
[1:26:06] the Jews to after time but you see we're
[1:26:09] in the day that you see we really need
[1:26:12] thus sayith the Lord amen because thus
[1:26:14] say the Lord comes directly from the
[1:26:16] Throne of God and when it come to the
[1:26:18] throne of God it can't fail because it's
[1:26:20] God now dropping down and he's speaking
[1:26:22] to the Sea the same voice that talked to
[1:26:25] Jehoshaphat the same voice that now was
[1:26:28] speaking to this woman is now moving and
[1:26:30] is moving through this man of God and
[1:26:32] it's Quicken that seed saying God has a
[1:26:35] promise for you you can't be deceived so
[1:26:38] when she stops she looks at her son son
[1:26:41] everything GNA be okay and she goes now
[1:26:45] and she says don't worry the devil ain't
[1:26:47] going to cheat you this time it's been a
[1:26:50] long time we've been starving it's been
[1:26:52] rough but she says you always treat
[1:26:56] God's servant right and she goes she
[1:26:59] says let me show you how you make a fire
[1:27:02] he says take two sticks just put them
[1:27:05] there once you lay them on top of each
[1:27:07] other he says now let me show you about
[1:27:09] this meal do you know that the god of
[1:27:12] Abraham the god of Isaac that he said
[1:27:15] that we had to wave the sheath offering
[1:27:18] he said we had to wave that wave sheep
[1:27:20] offering before the people every day the
[1:27:22] first day after the Passover we had to
[1:27:24] come and wave that before and you know
[1:27:26] the reason that we grind this Mill up so
[1:27:28] good is because it's Jesus Christ oh oh
[1:27:31] who is that Mom well I I never even
[1:27:34] heard I don't even know where that came
[1:27:36] from just just something came
[1:27:39] out Lord God oh Lord and she just keep
[1:27:42] let me show you how you grind and he
[1:27:44] said he took the meal she said but you
[1:27:46] know if you're going to make a cake when
[1:27:48] you if you say you really love God the
[1:27:50] word is not just enough you need God to
[1:27:53] come
[1:27:54] and anoint that word because when God
[1:27:58] anoints that word see son this is why we
[1:28:00] use the
[1:28:01] O Mommy that's the last of it don't
[1:28:03] worry about the Lord will provide amen
[1:28:06] is that what Abraham said yeah that's
[1:28:08] just yeah that's just like Abraham and
[1:28:10] she says let me show you how you make
[1:28:12] this biscuit now look at here now when
[1:28:14] she's showing him she's showing him that
[1:28:18] now this is his last meal this is
[1:28:20] everything that is not for him it's not
[1:28:24] for him she's showing him how to give oh
[1:28:27] Lord GL to God she's showing him how to
[1:28:30] give and now she says now in order for
[1:28:33] you to have bread you got to have heat
[1:28:36] he said the heat he said yes let me show
[1:28:39] you these two sticks I got one day God's
[1:28:41] going to give us a sa Hallelujah and
[1:28:43] he's going to go through so much for us
[1:28:45] he's going to be put through the T he's
[1:28:47] going to go every fiery D of the Devil
[1:28:49] he's going to go through it and guess
[1:28:51] what he said I got to he has to be put
[1:28:53] to
[1:28:55] so the Trials come and that brings a
[1:28:58] little heat and that being heat when we
[1:29:01] put this together it's going to be a
[1:29:03] nice big brown buttery
[1:29:05] biscuit what we going to do with it Mom
[1:29:08] I'mma show you so she goes and she takes
[1:29:11] that biscuit and imagine when she turns
[1:29:14] to take that biscuit she goes to this
[1:29:16] man of God and when she's going to the
[1:29:19] man of God she knows that that's her
[1:29:20] last minut and I ask you what is moving
[1:29:24] her to go give this
[1:29:27] away remember it was nothing else to eat
[1:29:30] it was her very last her son couldn't
[1:29:33] even follow because he was too weak he
[1:29:34] was still laying on the bed and she goes
[1:29:37] to bring this biscuit now to this man of
[1:29:40] God and I want you to see because she
[1:29:44] was a seed of God when God now took that
[1:29:48] time of the famine he made it just long
[1:29:50] enough so that his Prophet could go
[1:29:53] speak to this woman this widow woman and
[1:29:56] he spoke to this one specific woman
[1:29:59] because he knew that she would hold on
[1:30:00] to the word of God and now holding on to
[1:30:03] the word of God she could never forget
[1:30:06] what God had done for her amen and she
[1:30:08] comes and as she sees turning I want you
[1:30:11] to hear exactly what the pro the prophet
[1:30:13] of God told her he said look for thus
[1:30:17] sayth the Lord God of Israel the bell of
[1:30:22] meal shall not waste
[1:30:24] neither shall the Cru of oil fail so now
[1:30:28] he's saying what is it is that even
[1:30:30] though you've emptied out everything and
[1:30:32] you put it all in a Biscuit for me the
[1:30:35] very bucket that you made the meal out
[1:30:37] of when you go back and look it's going
[1:30:39] to be more meal in the bucket Oh Glory
[1:30:42] to God this bucket that you have it'll
[1:30:45] never one dry that's why the woman at
[1:30:47] the well when she saw what Jesus Christ
[1:30:49] was she dropped her water pot and the
[1:30:51] Bible say she kicked it why because now
[1:30:54] she have finally met her real husband
[1:30:56] she finally met the man who made the
[1:30:58] well the man who made the water the one
[1:31:00] who had the living water and now when
[1:31:02] you finally see that your meal will
[1:31:05] never run dry when you obey every word
[1:31:08] that God said amen it'll mean everything
[1:31:11] to you the bucket can't run dry and he
[1:31:14] said not only will the word of God not
[1:31:16] run dry but the anointing for you to
[1:31:20] understand the word it will never run
[1:31:22] dry
[1:31:24] you see God you got to have both the
[1:31:27] mechanics and the Dynamics now it's now
[1:31:30] for God to now if we could just move
[1:31:32] ourselves out the way and we would just
[1:31:34] move ourselves out the way and say Lord
[1:31:37] I have need of thee and this woman
[1:31:40] received a promise and the promise she
[1:31:43] received it says until the day the Lord
[1:31:48] sth rain upon the
[1:31:50] Earth don't worry about anything f Jesus
[1:31:54] said when they was in the
[1:31:55] temple that when he looked around he
[1:31:58] said he asked the disciples who gave the
[1:32:00] most and what did he do he looked over
[1:32:03] and he said this widow woman he said she
[1:32:05] gave the most and they said she only
[1:32:08] gave two might but what she gave she
[1:32:12] gave all she had he said the others gave
[1:32:14] out of their abundance and you wonder
[1:32:16] today with this woman came she had to
[1:32:19] give God everything to receive the
[1:32:22] promise so what about us amen remember
[1:32:25] it was Elijah that came
[1:32:28] spoke and Elijah now he had given
[1:32:31] everything and he he had done everything
[1:32:34] the Lord told him but what about us if
[1:32:36] we were to receive that same word will
[1:32:39] we not have to give everything to really
[1:32:42] receive from the Lord see it's hard to
[1:32:44] give up everything because it's hard to
[1:32:48] I I heard a guy one time he was at
[1:32:49] church he said but K said how do I know
[1:32:51] that I'm not being deceived
[1:32:54] he said how I said because God said you
[1:32:57] being his there's no way you can be
[1:32:59] deceived it's not a man it's not a man
[1:33:02] that can take you out of Christ it ain't
[1:33:05] a woman that can take you out of Christ
[1:33:07] but you have to now enter into enter
[1:33:11] into look at this as she wented
[1:33:13] according to the word of the Lord the
[1:33:15] Bible says she and he in her house they
[1:33:17] didn't eat
[1:33:18] any in closing I just want to read
[1:33:21] something to you turn this turn with if
[1:33:24] you you don't have to turn I'm just
[1:33:25] going to read it to you Hebrews
[1:33:28] 10 it's Hebrews 10 and
[1:33:32] 22 it
[1:33:34] says I just read 21 we have a high
[1:33:36] priest over the house of
[1:33:38] God and he said let us draw near with a
[1:33:42] True Heart of full
[1:33:44] Assurance of Faith having our heart
[1:33:49] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[1:33:52] our bodies wise with pure
[1:33:55] water let us hold fast the profession of
[1:33:59] our faith without
[1:34:00] wavering for he is faithful that
[1:34:05] promised let us consider one another to
[1:34:09] provoke unto love and unto good
[1:34:12] works as we stand he says as we let us
[1:34:15] stand he says not forsaking the Assembly
[1:34:19] of ourselves together as the man of su
[1:34:22] but exalting one another so much that
[1:34:24] we're more that we what as we see the
[1:34:26] day
[1:34:28] approaching my brothers sisters this
[1:34:32] morning if God has done all this for us
[1:34:35] let us be not deceived don't be cheated
[1:34:38] of everything that God wants to do for
[1:34:40] you you see the last scripture he said
[1:34:43] here he says not forsaking and
[1:34:46] assembling
[1:34:46] ourselves you see if God is Redeeming
[1:34:50] the time we say that we must redeem the
[1:34:52] time for all that God has done we we
[1:34:55] really must redeem the time then that
[1:34:57] means that we must truly press toward
[1:34:59] the mark and I want you to see if we're
[1:35:02] not forsaking ourselves that means we're
[1:35:04] coming together with the same heart with
[1:35:07] the same mind knowing that some may have
[1:35:10] kid problem some may have family problem
[1:35:13] husband wife boy girl job if we have
[1:35:16] these thing brother then should we not
[1:35:19] come together more should we not press
[1:35:22] together more
[1:35:24] because remember all of us some are
[1:35:26] stronger than others and so when you're
[1:35:29] not eating the same way you don't have
[1:35:32] the same strength as someone else then
[1:35:35] God has to use somebody to help pull you
[1:35:37] through I say this in closing it says
[1:35:40] this woman she wasn't deceived because
[1:35:42] she was a seed of God and you can't be
[1:35:45] deceived being a seed of God but there's
[1:35:48] a responsibility to say are you sure
[1:35:50] you're not being deceived when you see
[1:35:52] yourself slau
[1:35:54] when you see yourself maybe not giving
[1:35:56] God everything cuz you see if you're not
[1:35:59] the same way you were when you met
[1:36:01] Christ something is lacking something
[1:36:04] missing because if you're in a
[1:36:06] relationship you want that relationship
[1:36:08] to be just as good is when you first and
[1:36:11] you wanted to be that and more right so
[1:36:15] that mean it takes God to keep and
[1:36:18] strengthen you but also those that have
[1:36:21] not come to the faith that's what as we
[1:36:25] as we just in closing I ask you this
[1:36:29] morning if you've been
[1:36:32] cheap if you know maybe before the Lord
[1:36:36] that in your heart in your soul in your
[1:36:38] life that you're truly truly it says
[1:36:42] you're not really where you say where
[1:36:44] you need to be I had a man in a prison
[1:36:47] always say oh I love the Lord Brother K
[1:36:49] and this it would touch
[1:36:52] me you know this is one brother he would
[1:36:54] always even ask for tapes and he
[1:36:57] actually order books and things voice of
[1:36:58] God and all this kind of
[1:37:00] stuff but the guy end up getting a cell
[1:37:03] phone in prison that's what
[1:37:06] happen and you know the cell phone and
[1:37:09] she can see that it was a Temptation so
[1:37:12] he starts calling calling making calls
[1:37:14] then he gets
[1:37:15] called and the thing that touched me is
[1:37:17] I said well how many times and maybe
[1:37:20] preaching to e you say you ask everybody
[1:37:23] have the Holy Ghost have you given your
[1:37:25] life to the Lord everybody save sanctify
[1:37:28] and Fe but then when things come up it
[1:37:32] shows where we're really
[1:37:34] at it shows where we're really at
[1:37:37] because in your heart God knows who's
[1:37:40] King in your home it says husband love
[1:37:45] your wives and it says why you know
[1:37:46] submit to your husband all things so it
[1:37:48] has to be now two loving each other but
[1:37:51] it's still a hierarch God the man and a
[1:37:53] woman that's just the way God made it I
[1:37:56] didn't choose to be a man didn't choose
[1:37:58] to be black didn't choose to be K but
[1:37:59] that's what I am so that's that's where
[1:38:02] we at so now I have to abide by that so
[1:38:06] God made me a certain way why for his
[1:38:08] glory amen so you this morning I'm
[1:38:11] asking you truly as we just search our
[1:38:13] hearts and our soul before the Lord you
[1:38:16] says are you do you think if de pression
[1:38:18] came down you really be like this woman
[1:38:21] in the Bible
[1:38:23] you think that's really where you're at
[1:38:25] this morning that nothing could
[1:38:29] shake that God that you see here sitting
[1:38:32] on the throne of your heart you give
[1:38:34] everything you give your last to your
[1:38:37] brother you give your last to the pastor
[1:38:40] may you give your last to beac preacher
[1:38:43] whoever your wife your da your son your
[1:38:46] daughter what you give your last for
[1:38:48] someone else other than you knowing that
[1:38:51] God will provide and and that's what you
[1:38:54] see we can come to church and have
[1:38:56] church but it's different when you see
[1:38:59] when God comes and he really wants to
[1:39:01] tell you says in this hour many people
[1:39:04] are being
[1:39:05] deceived and they're going to church
[1:39:07] every day they even pay they even pay
[1:39:09] that time they even go to the prayer me
[1:39:12] but they're being
[1:39:13] deceived why because you see it has to
[1:39:16] be true fellowship with the word God has
[1:39:19] to anointed and I just ask you this as
[1:39:23] we as we just just sing this little hymn
[1:39:25] before we pray if you have any need
[1:39:28] before God Search Your Heart search your
[1:39:31] home search your phone search your Cloud
[1:39:34] search your bookcase search a radio
[1:39:37] station in your car search everything
[1:39:39] are you truly before God is he all is
[1:39:42] your heart that's all you want is
[1:39:45] Christ is there anything you if you put
[1:39:49] your kids before God they're
[1:39:51] not this is about you and God
[1:39:54] as we just pray
