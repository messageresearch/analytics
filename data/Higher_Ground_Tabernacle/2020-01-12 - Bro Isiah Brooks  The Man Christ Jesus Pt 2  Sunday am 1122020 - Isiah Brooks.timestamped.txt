[10:27] amen God is good to us amen I'm without
[10:34] a jacket because I forgot I left it
[10:38] there thinking I had and didn't realize
[10:41] I had I meant I missed it until God is
[10:47] good to us I'm so glad I'm still saved
[10:51] without a jacket it's just just a thing
[10:58] that I like to do God is good to us for
[11:02] those of us who don't know our system
[11:04] they only had her babies
[11:06] twin twins one boy and one girl
[11:09] and their beautiful babies
[11:12] amen is so funny because the one that's
[11:17] named Naomi look like brother Joseph and
[11:21] the one that named Josie looks like
[11:24] Naomi
[11:27] Amen so got one at one of each God is so
[11:33] good to us and I thank God for our
[11:35] sister and her husband and you know for
[11:38] them coming out as well as they did God
[11:41] is so good to us
[11:43] you love the Lord we realize Amen that
[11:46] we are about to embrace a new age if I
[11:51] could say it like that or we're getting
[11:53] ready to encounter something that's
[11:55] beyond our imagination and if I'm
[12:00] deceived I'm enjoying it because I
[12:03] really do believe that the coming of the
[12:04] Lord is at hand the one thing that I
[12:08] love about it and that's before I get
[12:09] into a let's turn to first Corinthians
[12:11] the second chapter and then from there
[12:14] we'll go to John 15
[12:20] first Corinthians 2
[12:30] I have been basing most of my services
[12:32] recently from the messages that I have
[12:36] been studying and it's I've been really
[12:39] going through the Hebrew series Satan's
[12:48] Eden and hear ye him and those messages
[12:52] are packed with good stuff and I do
[12:55] thank the Lord for His goodness because
[12:57] no matter how much you study until God
[13:00] quickens it he has to make it alive to
[13:03] you and it must be real to you otherwise
[13:06] you're just getting knowledge in your
[13:08] head but we realize Amen that God is not
[13:12] giving us knowledge in the head he's
[13:13] working with the heart so we thank God
[13:16] for the heart revelation amen our 1st
[13:22] Corinthians 2 1 through 2 and I brethren
[13:26] when I came to you came not with
[13:29] excellency of speech or wisdom declaring
[13:33] unto you the testimony of God for I
[13:37] determined not to know anything among
[13:40] you save Jesus Christ and him crucified
[13:44] John 15 we started on a message
[13:51] Wednesday the man Christ Jesus we're
[13:54] going to still work with that because
[13:57] you understand the Prophet God says he
[14:00] became us and we became him and so we
[14:04] must know who he is before we can
[14:06] identify ourselves in the scripture and
[14:10] so we appreciate the Lord Jesus and
[14:13] everything that he is doing for us st.
[14:17] John 15 we'll begin by God's grace at
[14:22] the 15th verse it is amazing our great
[14:33] God can be so great and yet so humble
[14:39] yet so small
[14:43] you can almost see if why God would
[14:45] resist the proud because if if there
[14:50] were space for pride and God he would
[14:52] have had it and he would have deserved
[14:55] it
[14:56] and he could show that it was what he
[14:59] should be but we realized that our God
[15:01] as great as he is liking himself as a
[15:04] sheep a dove those things kind of really
[15:09] it isn't it it just does something to me
[15:13] to know what God is changing me into st.
[15:19] John 15 and beginning at the fifteenth
[15:21] verse his fourth I call you and not
[15:25] servants call you not servants for the
[15:29] servant knowing not what his Lord doeth
[15:32] but I call you friends I love that for
[15:38] all things that I have heard of my
[15:40] father I have made known unto you and
[15:43] that's what friends do they will share
[15:47] with you even some of their most secret
[15:50] things because of trust you have not
[15:54] chosen me but I have chosen you and
[15:59] ordained you that you should go and
[16:04] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[16:07] should remain that whatsoever ye ask of
[16:11] the Father in my name he may give it you
[16:16] now now he's telling you something he's
[16:19] telling us something that in other words
[16:23] we we sometimes think that our
[16:26] worthiness is what get things done it'll
[16:31] never be your worthiness it's always
[16:35] God's worthiness and because he chose us
[16:37] and the Bible says not only has he
[16:39] chosen that's B he has ordained us a man
[16:45] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[16:48] and that your fruit should remain that
[16:52] whatsoever you ask of the Father in my
[16:54] name he
[16:56] give it you these things I commend you
[17:00] that you love one another let us pray
[17:05] father father we thank you for your
[17:07] grace we thank you for your mercy we
[17:11] thank you for being so good to us Lord
[17:15] you have been better to us than we have
[17:18] been to ourselves and father there is
[17:20] nothing that we can do O God to even
[17:24] help our salvation because we realize
[17:27] that salvation is of the Lord it is you
[17:31] who starts it and as you who finishes it
[17:33] it is you who brings us to perfection
[17:36] there is no good deed within us nothing
[17:40] good of ourselves the Bible according to
[17:44] your word Lord says we have all come
[17:46] short we have all sinned and come short
[17:49] of the glory of God the Lord God it's
[17:53] you who have made it possible that we
[17:56] would come into your glory grant it now
[18:00] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[18:04] seated
[18:05] I'm gonna take my time by God's grace
[18:08] and I'll try to go as slow as I possibly
[18:12] can if I speed up it's because he's
[18:15] speeding me up but by God's grace I'm
[18:20] just learning so much about the Lord
[18:26] Jesus and about what God is is is
[18:30] requiring of us we're living in a time
[18:35] when we can see within ourselves that is
[18:40] impossible for us to live this word
[18:45] without Jesus Christ and in all of our
[18:50] efforts we we will always come short of
[18:54] the glory of God I think God that
[18:59] salvation is not something you have to
[19:01] work for the Bible said it is the gift
[19:06] of God thank God for the gift
[19:09] a gift is something that you don't merit
[19:13] it is something that a friend or person
[19:17] or someone gives you because they in
[19:21] some way appreciate you and sometime
[19:24] it's just because they love you
[19:27] um we look at the world as it is now we
[19:34] never see Jesus Christ as a gift but
[19:38] Jesus Christ is the greatest gift that
[19:41] God could have given us because this
[19:45] gift was given by God it was the best
[19:49] gift that could ever be given is that
[19:52] right you know even brother Branham said
[19:55] that's the best gift that God could give
[19:56] you outside of Hawaii
[19:59] Alleluia so God gives us his gift and
[20:03] this gift that he gives us amen is
[20:07] himself the thing that I love about this
[20:13] message it takes away hope and it gives
[20:17] us faith because when you hope for
[20:22] something it doesn't mean you're going
[20:25] to get it but when faith is given faith
[20:31] will make those things that be not as
[20:35] though they were faith will move
[20:39] mountains and you and I must understand
[20:42] that even faith is a gift of God
[20:47] you can't muster faith you cannot
[20:52] pretend that you have it it is something
[20:55] that is given to you you don't even know
[20:58] how you got it you don't know when it
[21:02] came but you know you got it it is
[21:06] something that God imparts to you we
[21:11] look at the Old Testament and the
[21:14] scripture says even in Hebrews by faith
[21:17] you know this did this one did that and
[21:19] everything but you got to understand God
[21:23] didn't say
[21:23] by Joshua said by faith Joshua in other
[21:30] words this faith was given to Joshua for
[21:34] Joshua to speak to the son and say son
[21:38] stand still this faith was given to Sara
[21:42] it was given to Abraham and you got to
[21:46] understand that this faith we're talking
[21:48] about is not something Amen that you can
[21:52] buy in a grocery store or even in a
[21:56] Theological Seminary doesn't give you
[21:59] faith you can learn this Bible from A to
[22:04] Z and you got to realize that it will
[22:08] not produce faith we know the Bible says
[22:13] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[22:15] the Word of God hallelujah because we
[22:19] must understand it's not the letter that
[22:23] you hear when you read this Bible is not
[22:26] the letter that speaks hallelujah it is
[22:31] the voice it is the spirit behind the
[22:34] letter that gives you revelation of what
[22:38] the letter is
[22:40] hallelujah how many read the Bible the
[22:44] old scrolls and they never saw the
[22:48] coming of Jesus Christ but yet there
[22:52] were those who could read the scrolls or
[22:55] even hear the scrolls and the voice of
[22:58] the scrolls spoke to them
[23:01] yeah understand thing it has to be a
[23:04] voice it has to be a living spirit that
[23:08] lifts these words off of the pages in
[23:11] order for you and I to understand it and
[23:14] when that voice is lifted off the pages
[23:17] that's what we call quickened when the
[23:20] spirit quickens the Word of God to you
[23:23] it becomes living it's no longer history
[23:26] is no longer words in a book it becomes
[23:29] a lie now only God can do that
[23:34] that's why sometime when we reading the
[23:37] Bible
[23:37] to some of us the Bible may be boring
[23:39] sometimes the Bible made me it may be a
[23:43] task before you and the reason why it
[23:46] becomes that is because you're trying to
[23:48] understand the Bible in your intellect
[23:51] but when you approach God in the spirit
[23:55] and read his Bible in the spirit it is
[23:58] then the Spirit will quicken the words
[24:00] to you and then you will enjoy it
[24:04] it will never be your intellect that
[24:10] will be able to absorb absorb God it is
[24:15] the spirit man on the inside
[24:17] the living creature this flesh is dead
[24:21] but there is a living creature on the
[24:25] inside that we call ourselves it is a
[24:28] born-again experience that literally
[24:31] make this Bible live why you say that
[24:34] because the Bible says that the carnal
[24:36] mind cannot understand those things that
[24:39] are spiritual as long as you're not born
[24:41] again you just think you know hallelujah
[24:47] now there are times that God will grant
[24:49] you a revelation even though you're not
[24:53] born again hello is that true because
[24:59] Peter understood who the Messiah was he
[25:02] understood who Christ was and he had not
[25:05] yet gone to Pentecost so you got to
[25:09] understand that this revelation that God
[25:13] has given to us by way of Malachi 4
[25:15] should never leave your heart now if
[25:19] it's just in your life Satan can come
[25:22] and take it because that's where Satan
[25:25] battles us it that right the private God
[25:27] tells us that the greatest battle ever
[25:29] fought is in your mind it is where Satan
[25:33] deceived Eve in her mind and that's
[25:37] where the devil comes and deceives us in
[25:40] our minds for Paul understanding
[25:44] predestination Paul understood that the
[25:48] subjects of of suffering and
[25:51] and in gone rejection and all of the
[25:54] things that he had gone through he
[25:56] understood that this was just a journey
[25:59] he had to go through that he was in
[26:03] Christ and Christ was in him and so Paul
[26:09] understood nothing of laws no laws y'all
[26:14] better than him no laws can separate him
[26:18] from the love of God no laws is that Ted
[26:23] touch not taste not handle not that's
[26:26] not it the church ages showed us that no
[26:31] matter how much they touch not taste not
[26:34] a handle not there was still many of
[26:37] them who was still lost and they did
[26:40] everything right
[26:42] hello ah you say what do you mean
[26:46] because salvation does not come by you
[26:52] salvation only comes by being elected
[26:56] and chosen from the foundation of the
[27:00] world it is that that election that
[27:06] perfection the understand me coz when
[27:09] God chose you he did not make a mistake
[27:14] it is that election that takes you from
[27:17] this dimension into the next dimension
[27:20] I'm feeling coming to something in just
[27:23] a moment just listening to Hebrews a7
[27:27] with the prophet of God is telling us
[27:28] about the lady 5 6 and 7 with a lady who
[27:33] had been raised in a Christian family
[27:37] and here he is Amen in this particular
[27:41] restaurant
[27:42] here's the police over at the slot
[27:45] machine he got his arm around this lady
[27:48] this young girl about 27 years old
[27:50] this one lady she's got her hair blue
[27:53] nails blue whatever everything was blue
[27:56] and here she was about 65 to 70 years
[28:00] old he said the wrinkles was everywhere
[28:03] he said even had these little bitty
[28:05] and she had so many wrinkles they were
[28:07] kind of layered a layered and he thought
[28:11] to himself he says oh my god why don't
[28:15] you do something about this now I'm
[28:17] paraphrasing it he said they all drunk
[28:23] what about this little girl over here
[28:25] what about this young man over here
[28:26] these are bad examples and they will
[28:31] become what they're looking at and
[28:33] brother Brennan says listen I just
[28:36] wanted God to do something he said all
[28:39] of a sudden I saw something were living
[28:41] for me what was it God was giving him a
[28:45] vision he was getting ready to have a
[28:48] real I couldn't conference with God so
[28:53] when this thing took place he began to
[28:56] see himself see God then show him the
[28:58] woman God showed him himself see before
[29:02] you points fingers of judgment and
[29:04] somebody else God will show you you
[29:09] right because none of us are in a place
[29:12] to judge one another
[29:15] Oh nobody has a heaven to put anybody in
[29:19] none of us
[29:20] you understand me so here was a prophet
[29:24] come on somebody a man who thought that
[29:27] he was in such a condition with God he
[29:30] was okay you don't think he thought that
[29:33] he did if you really listen to the
[29:36] conversation when God began to show him
[29:39] his sin he said oh my did I do that
[29:42] thought I didn't mean to do that
[29:45] y'all pay attention I didn't mean to do
[29:48] that
[29:49] right and what took place amen
[29:53] God began to show him his sin and when
[29:57] he said he said I said my sin would go
[30:00] up before God and that's I would see the
[30:02] blood he said it was a blood veil the
[30:05] blood veil that blocked his sins from
[30:08] God he said every time my sin would go
[30:12] up it was shake a minute and Jesus would
[30:15] wipe it off
[30:16] hallelujah he said I saw a book and that
[30:19] book had all kinds of letters written
[30:22] down sins that I had done hello
[30:27] somebody help me here I've tried to show
[30:30] you something because when God chooses
[30:34] you he has chosen you to be perfect and
[30:39] he has provided a way for you to be
[30:43] perfect this perfection does not come by
[30:48] you're doing good things or you're doing
[30:50] bad things this perfection only comes by
[30:54] the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah and
[31:00] here the Prophet is looking and he's
[31:04] looking and and and and and he says all
[31:07] of a sudden Jesus takes the blood and
[31:11] place it on his shin on the book and
[31:13] throw the books behind and he said in
[31:15] the sea of forgetfulness and then God
[31:19] comes and said now I forgave you but you
[31:23] wanted to send her to hell
[31:25] or you want to let make her just
[31:28] disappear he said all my god did I do
[31:32] that see he wasn't even aware because
[31:34] when you condemn someone you're
[31:37] literally condemning them to hell
[31:39] somebody help me because somebody you
[31:42] couldn't if they're condemned where do
[31:44] you think they're going but in our
[31:47] consciousness we're not aware of what
[31:50] we're doing
[31:50] sometimes my judgment is far harsh than
[31:53] what we think but God is pure God she's
[31:57] a very intent of the heart he goes
[31:59] beyond your feelings and he sees a very
[32:02] thought that you have and what that
[32:05] thought will bring to pass if it was
[32:09] performed but what brother Branham did
[32:16] see because he said Lord how do I know
[32:20] who the witness - how do I know who is
[32:24] elected somebody help me
[32:29] because when you speak the word to
[32:31] somebody they may hear and they may not
[32:35] hear but that is no way for you to judge
[32:38] well I spoke to them the word and they
[32:41] rejected it so they lost no sir
[32:45] sometimes it take a long time for a son
[32:48] and daughter of God to recognize they
[32:51] are sons and daughters of God hallelujah
[32:56] so you gotta realize by God's grace his
[33:00] lady was saved and she forgot she was
[33:03] saved
[33:06] hello you see because the blood of Jesus
[33:11] Christ can only truly be how could I say
[33:15] it received by those whom God elected
[33:19] and chosen to receive it and he was
[33:22] elated
[33:23] who wants new Jesus she testifies but
[33:27] daddy was a preacher I grew up in a
[33:29] Christian home and because of things
[33:32] that happen in my life this is what I
[33:35] become see it doesn't matter somebody
[33:38] like backslide they may be a come to be
[33:41] a streetwalker or a murderer or whatever
[33:44] but still in the inside of the inside
[33:49] there is a chosen seed of God that will
[33:54] not allow them to die y'all hear me
[33:58] without God making it right I didn't say
[34:02] him making he making it right God making
[34:04] it right let me jump to another point
[34:06] remember brother man who said this
[34:09] preacher who once preached became an
[34:11] alcoholic
[34:12] and because he wouldn't wouldn't repent
[34:14] God took his life he said the man was
[34:18] saved she is beyond our comprehension
[34:22] because we want to look at people say oh
[34:24] there's no way he could be saved
[34:26] you don't know whose names are on the
[34:28] book it is Jesus Christ whose nor knows
[34:33] whose names are on the book somebody
[34:37] help me here see I want you to
[34:39] understand like the brother brother
[34:41] Levin said it is
[34:42] a call for a man to go to hell he has to
[34:46] fight his way there do y'all believe
[34:48] that I believe that in order for a man
[34:52] or woman to go to hell they have to
[34:55] fight their way their God do not he does
[34:58] not make it easy for you to go to hell
[35:01] somebody help me now if y'all don't
[35:05] shout I am I'm holding my feet down
[35:07] right now my point is because you know
[35:11] we we find ourselves we find ourselves
[35:15] so saddened because we find ourselves as
[35:21] failures we feel every day and failing
[35:26] is not a good thing but God will is not
[35:31] for us to walk with our heads down in a
[35:36] world of sadness you understand me
[35:40] when we walk in sadness we literally
[35:43] forget what our atonement has done what
[35:48] the blood sacrifice has done for us the
[35:51] blood sacrifice did not restore us and
[35:53] bring us to an atmosphere where God you
[35:56] said it means that you someone you lost
[35:59] the vision of your sacrifice y'all know
[36:05] what I mean by that
[36:06] you lost the vision you forgot God died
[36:09] for you you forgot that he took all your
[36:12] sins upon him we forgotten that he is
[36:17] our escape goat Lord restore to me the
[36:22] joy of salvation
[36:24] you understand me because we are not
[36:27] lost we are saved and God wants us
[36:30] that's what Paul said forgetting all
[36:33] these doctrines doctor the baptism
[36:36] doctrine of lean on his doctor that's
[36:39] all good all of that has played its part
[36:42] he's in but let us move on to perfection
[36:46] and there is only one perfection and
[36:49] that's Jesus Christ himself and when the
[36:51] Holy Ghost comes in and
[36:54] Sheils you you are protected not your
[36:57] flesh no flesh is condemned but your sue
[37:01] is perfected and God wants us to walk as
[37:06] though we're perfected help me Jesus
[37:10] ain't no looking looking back God's died
[37:15] once and for all hallelujah let me go on
[37:19] because remember brother man said that
[37:21] man was saved God couldn't get him to
[37:23] repent so God put him to sleep
[37:27] hallelujah and here was this woman she
[37:31] was out of her time she should have been
[37:34] living in this day the way she was
[37:35] dressed blue hair blue wherever blue
[37:40] whatever any man and drinking herself to
[37:44] death
[37:44] and we're gonna look at that woman cuz
[37:47] this the way we look at people with
[37:49] tattoos we you know it scares us
[37:52] sometime when we see so many tattoos now
[37:55] I'm talking about myself you know when I
[37:59] see so many tattoos it just like world
[38:01] what's on the inside of that house
[38:04] that's the way I think called those
[38:07] tattoos is an expression of something
[38:10] something inspiring them to do that
[38:13] hallelujah but they cannot be no worse
[38:16] than Legion oh come on somebody and we
[38:21] saw somebody running around as naked as
[38:23] Legion we would know that their demon
[38:25] possessed and they going to hell but
[38:28] Legion didn't go to hell hallelujah
[38:31] somebody help me here because Jesus
[38:34] crossed the sea to deliver Legion
[38:40] hallelujah you know how leaders became
[38:43] Legion we wouldn't never know brother
[38:46] Branham said Legion became Legion by
[38:50] stealing out of the offering plate and
[38:54] one line was added to one lie another
[38:58] lie and every time you lie he lies
[39:01] another demon came in stealing out of
[39:06] listen even in the
[39:07] prayerline you'll find out that
[39:09] sicknesses were brought upon people
[39:11] because when they were little they stole
[39:13] out of the offering plate even when they
[39:16] were Catholics you see that's what
[39:20] people don't understand God watched
[39:22] things and when people give money as
[39:25] unto the Lord it is as unto the Lord
[39:27] it's whatever the preacher does with it
[39:30] that's between him and God but when any
[39:33] soul give unto the Lord oh yeah you got
[39:40] to understand what I'm working with
[39:42] now wait let's get back to the point
[39:45] we're trying to make here was this woman
[39:47] away of course and she said do you think
[39:51] God would forgive me brother and said
[39:55] surely God will forgive you he showed me
[40:01] God loves the money when you in that
[40:05] condition sometimes like that lady said
[40:07] I wanted to come down to the meeting but
[40:11] she felt so bad because of all of her
[40:14] sins she just thought God had forgotten
[40:20] about her but God didn't God will never
[40:26] leave you no will he forsake you he said
[40:31] I'll be with you always to the end is
[40:33] that right if a man believed in me and
[40:35] confess with his mouth the Bible says
[40:37] he's in have passed from death unto life
[40:40] Oh somebody help me man I know this by
[40:44] but I have to do this this morning
[40:46] because in order to bring the joy back
[40:49] you've got to look at your sacrifice and
[40:51] recognize you are free that right the
[40:58] Bible said Jesus Christ has made us free
[41:01] from the laws of sin and death it is in
[41:05] Christ Jesus that the grace of God has
[41:07] saved you it's not by power not by mind
[41:11] but by his spirit saith the Lord don't
[41:16] get me wrong a true believer always
[41:20] wanted
[41:21] right before God and as soon as we make
[41:25] mistakes we sell or forgive us
[41:27] hallelujah do we have to feel a whirling
[41:29] wind no sir
[41:31] do we have to hear thunder no sir
[41:33] hallelujah we just have to make sure
[41:36] that our coming from our heart you mean
[41:38] it when it's a sincere confession God
[41:41] takes whatever you've done and throw it
[41:44] away see what we don't understand is
[41:49] that God is not a God of time and he
[41:53] always know when you gonna confess
[41:55] that's why he gives you the Holy Ghost
[41:57] cuz he know you wont to do right
[41:59] hallelujah
[42:01] and God don't run up and he said all
[42:03] there's another sin oh there's another
[42:05] sin the Bible said once and for all from
[42:09] the time you're saved to the time you
[42:11] die God has collected all those sins and
[42:13] put them in the sea of forgetfulness you
[42:16] are walking free and you don't even know
[42:18] it hallelujah you're just like Johnny
[42:22] crow ain't meant thinking that you're
[42:24] not free oh I've been tied to this habit
[42:27] for a long time and God don't already
[42:30] cut the cord yeah see it's your thought
[42:35] it's your mind that keeps you in prison
[42:37] to the things that you've done and you
[42:40] declare you're not doing penton's but
[42:42] whenever you get down the pray and
[42:45] you're not already confess your sins and
[42:47] then you let the devil come and bring
[42:50] those sins back up
[42:51] that's penton's you gonna all the way
[42:57] back years and God he's standing there
[43:01] like what are you talking about you're
[43:03] not already confessed this hallelujah
[43:07] why you letting the devil bring this up
[43:09] I can't even remember it because I put
[43:11] it in the sea of forgetfulness
[43:13] why are you remembering it I'm asked
[43:18] that question can you change what you've
[43:20] done already ain't no use in remembering
[43:25] it then it's finished hallelujah listen
[43:32] probably gosh
[43:33] him he says the greatest weapon was ever
[43:37] put in the hands of land is the Bible to
[43:42] be backed up with the Holy Spirit now a
[43:44] lot of people don't even believe in this
[43:46] Bible anymore they said you don't have
[43:49] to read this no more you got the spoken
[43:50] word but they got that understand the
[43:52] spoken word came from here you
[43:56] understand me amen you got to understand
[44:00] this Bible and the spoken word must
[44:02] agree because nobody can add and nobody
[44:05] can take away it must agree so you and I
[44:10] must understand and then you got to do
[44:12] both you got to read both of these
[44:16] hallelujah and even if you read the
[44:18] prophets message you can say oh I got
[44:21] the revelation you know he can say it
[44:23] one way without the Holy Spirit you miss
[44:26] understanding you got to have the Holy
[44:30] Ghost in order to understand what
[44:32] brother Branham says that's why we got
[44:35] all this confusion that's why we got
[44:37] great men of God thinking they're eight
[44:41] messengers only seven stars and somebody
[44:47] made an eighth one yeah I'm just saying
[44:52] so you got to realize by God's grace
[44:55] that I know I'm working with spirits
[44:57] people let me tell you something since
[44:59] I've started in this series about trying
[45:01] to show people who Jesus Christ really
[45:03] is I have had so many demonic attacks
[45:07] from the devil amen that I have to make
[45:09] sure I carry a smile on my face it's
[45:12] been just that intense you know why
[45:15] because it has the name of Jesus that
[45:19] demons tremble is that right even your
[45:23] prophet our prophet showed that he said
[45:25] remember those witches Amen that had the
[45:28] table in the chance floating in the air
[45:30] he said in the name of Trinity in the
[45:33] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost in
[45:35] the name of William Branham he said
[45:38] nothing but he said when I said in the
[45:42] name of Jesus Christ
[45:43] he said that chan cable fell breaking
[45:46] his legs and
[45:48] so I'm not Antichrist I'm standing for
[45:53] what he stood for oh and I know I'm
[46:02] different somebody told me I don't know
[46:06] where the stood a said this this big old
[46:08] regional storm that we had they said
[46:11] they named it Isaiah there came in
[46:21] tearing it up
[46:24] hallelujah Oh God of all my years I've
[46:31] never heard a storm called Isaiah but
[46:33] the Lord has showed me I'm actually
[46:35] going against a lot of people's ideas
[46:40] and thoughts and I'm causing a lot of
[46:43] trouble but it ain't me is God in me if
[46:47] we're gonna make a rapture we must bear
[46:51] the name of Jesus Christ and people
[46:54] think I'm coming against William Branham
[46:56] do I look like a fool to you I'm not one
[47:00] I know what I'm saying
[47:02] and I know the inspiration I'm saying
[47:04] this in somebody help me here
[47:07] so I want you to understand by God's
[47:09] grace I do what I do by the authority of
[47:12] the Lord Jesus Christ and I know where
[47:15] I'm headed I know what's happening here
[47:17] the Lord has already showed me and I
[47:21] didn't even see it
[47:22] but when even I asked Peter he said
[47:24] Peter who do men say that I am he says
[47:28] son saying you are Jeremiah some say
[47:31] that you Elias
[47:32] some say you one of the prophets see
[47:40] even those who said he was a prophet
[47:42] they saw the mighty works he did but
[47:45] that wasn't the answer he was looking
[47:46] for we know brother Branham is a prophet
[47:50] we've seen his life his work everything
[47:54] nothing can deny that but was he
[47:58] projecting himself
[48:00] or was he preaching like powell paul
[48:04] said i say i don't want to know nothing
[48:06] save jesus christ and him crucified and
[48:09] brother brandon said i have preached
[48:11] exactly what paul preached and all
[48:14] heaven said we are resting on that
[48:21] hallelujah now if i got up here and i
[48:24] told you to stop listening to the
[48:25] message then you have a right to walk
[48:28] out this door if I came up here and said
[48:33] well I don't believe william branham was
[48:34] a the messenger of the hour you have a
[48:37] right to walk out of this door
[48:40] hallelujah but i know he's a messenger
[48:44] nobody taught me this nobody school
[48:47] taught me this no preacher talked to me
[48:50] got me this my Holy Ghost showed me who
[48:54] he was
[48:55] I was really cute by my own people
[48:58] called me a brand might call me a
[49:01] fanatic call me everything else because
[49:05] I saw who William Branham was but it
[49:07] never stopped there no it doesn't stop
[49:14] there because that's what John disciples
[49:17] did they stopped with John and John
[49:20] pointed to Jesus
[49:22] somebody helped me here and those who
[49:25] follow Jesus got Jesus blessings there
[49:28] was years later they found John disciple
[49:32] still believing in John hallelujah and
[49:35] Paul said unto what baptism have you
[49:38] been baptized hallelujah it was a good
[49:42] baptism but you got to be baptized in
[49:44] the name of Jesus Christ somebody help
[49:47] me here Paul said it is this okay so I
[49:53] want you to understand you must
[49:57] understand the word brother been said
[49:59] this word represents the man who I got a
[50:05] quote for it he said the Bible is a man
[50:08] and the church is a woman
[50:13] he said this man will never lead you
[50:16] wrong but the woman led man wrong see
[50:21] what I'm trying to say is there are
[50:22] churches who are leading wrong because
[50:26] they're the ones leading and not the
[50:29] pastor will somebody help me here
[50:33] see what I'm trying to say and the
[50:35] pastor has been led by Christ not 19 hey
[50:41] if you don't have the anointing you're
[50:43] not being led by Christ and there's a
[50:46] lot of preachers who need the Holy Ghost
[50:49] they have fallen in tradition let me
[50:53] move on cuz you know yo I'm just trying
[50:56] to I can't rush it the Lord said you got
[50:58] to take your time because there's so
[51:00] many people who have been taught such a
[51:01] way till it's very difficult for them to
[51:04] comprehend what you're saying because
[51:06] there's such a fine line you understand
[51:10] me there was a time when God was working
[51:14] with brother Branham till it was
[51:16] absolutely God but guess what the
[51:20] Prophet says I didn't do nothing it was
[51:25] him
[51:27] youngest and me so you got to understand
[51:30] now if you're gonna believe everything
[51:31] brother bear I'm saying you got to
[51:32] believe those kind of statements to
[51:37] Jesus Christ did at all oh he made
[51:44] william branham he made you he made all
[51:46] of us do you believe that that that when
[51:52] did Jesus ever tell a lie he never told
[51:56] a lie brother Branham did when did Jesus
[52:01] ever was oh I was gonna kill him that
[52:04] man that killed my dog I was gonna kill
[52:08] him I was waiting on him
[52:10] I had my shotgun and the thing is that
[52:13] right
[52:13] he said but I got converted at what
[52:17] point in time Jesus got converted
[52:21] somebody help me here you know what I'm
[52:23] trying to show you so that you can see
[52:26] where you are
[52:27] how you gonna understand william branham
[52:29] in the God in william branham you never
[52:32] you don't understand that you'll never
[52:33] understand you you'll never understand
[52:36] where God is calling you to hallelujah
[52:39] Oh somebody help me yeah I feel excited
[52:42] because I know see what I'm seeing
[52:46] makes me know nothing can separate me
[52:49] from the love of God I didn't give my
[52:54] Shep this revelation Jesus Christ gave
[52:57] me this revelation and I know because of
[53:01] this revelation I don't have to look
[53:03] back and what God did I'm looking right
[53:08] now and what God is doing I don't have
[53:11] to look forward cuz he doesn't already
[53:13] told me what he's gonna do but right now
[53:16] we need to see Christ in all of us
[53:23] hallelujah you love the Lord you know I
[53:33] got this scripture down and I'm gonna
[53:35] just run through it quickly Matthew 1:21
[53:38] and we know this and she shall bring
[53:41] forth a son and thou shalt call his name
[53:43] Jesus for he shall save his people from
[53:47] their sins now brother Branham said this
[53:50] he said if you read this Bible and you
[53:53] don't see Jesus on every page basically
[53:55] he said go back and read it why didn't
[54:00] he say if you don't see me he said if
[54:03] you don't see Jesus in men cancer that
[54:07] he said Jesus was mezcal today in its
[54:10] theophany form y'all huh he had no
[54:13] beginning of days and no end and them
[54:15] nights but you got people said what
[54:18] brother bands was like hesitate if he
[54:19] was it was only because the kisser dick
[54:21] was in it he was the bottle and Makassar
[54:27] that was the wine you understanding and
[54:37] people are so afraid
[54:39] if you say that wrong brothers you gonna
[54:42] blaspheme the Holy Ghost the elected
[54:43] cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost and you
[54:49] and I must understand if I blaspheme the
[54:52] Holy Ghost it was ordained for me to do
[54:54] so but how can the Holy Ghost blaspheme
[54:57] the Holy Ghost mmm but people afraid and
[55:04] they don't understand the spirit there's
[55:07] a spirit that makes you afraid to tell
[55:09] the truth and in this day of time you
[55:13] know what I fear I feel God y'all want a
[55:17] revival you got to pick up the name of
[55:20] Jesus Christ again you got to start
[55:24] talking about Jesus mr. two people are
[55:30] all brothers you just taking this thing
[55:32] too far I'm gonna tell you something
[55:34] there was only one who was able to
[55:37] loosen or open the book and loose the
[55:39] seals thereof nobody in our generation
[55:42] nobody before our generation was able to
[55:46] loose this only one and who was in
[55:49] heaven all of the twenty-four elders
[55:52] fell down on their faces worshiping the
[55:57] lamb worshiping the lamb and who was the
[56:01] Lamb of God John said the lamb was Jesus
[56:06] and when John came he meant to worship
[56:09] the angel he said get up from there and
[56:13] worship God only and we said oh that was
[56:17] brother Branham it was brother Branham
[56:20] that's the scripture that shows who he
[56:23] was he didn't have a name but we now
[56:26] know the name but if his message was to
[56:29] worship God only why are we worshiping
[56:31] something else and one brother I guess
[56:42] he got so mad with me he said
[56:48] thank God for Jesus Christ in the form
[56:51] of brother Branham and I thought in some
[57:01] ways that's true but not in all ways and
[57:11] you say well what'd you talk about
[57:12] but thank God for Jesus Christ
[57:16] in the form of my sister Naomi you got
[57:21] to bring it personally you can't just
[57:23] keep it with one man because it becomes
[57:25] idolatry somebody help me here see you
[57:29] got to understand that if he was the
[57:31] waist sheet that means war was to come
[57:34] well where is the more hmm that's why he
[57:41] went off to pry off the scene because he
[57:43] said people were worshipping him y'all
[57:45] understand me and these were all praise
[57:48] God i worshipping William Branham let me
[57:50] ask you a question and I I gotta treat
[57:53] you like he said it how many times a day
[57:55] you call on Jesus versus the days you
[57:58] call them William Branham case dismissed
[58:10] and we'll say what brother Brando he'll
[58:12] does person brother brand I'm healed
[58:13] that person brother man said I never
[58:15] healed nobody he said Jesus Christ never
[58:18] healed anybody he said it was God who
[58:22] healed because Jesus said I have done
[58:24] nothing he said he worked and then I
[58:27] work here the - in other words he showed
[58:29] me what I wants to be done and then I do
[58:31] what he wants me to do none of y'all I
[58:35] don't care if you lay hands on the seat
[58:36] please god I laid my hand on the sick
[58:39] and they recovered so I you didn't heal
[58:42] nobody only God can heal now people am I
[58:50] right or wrong I'm still preaching the
[58:53] message that brother Branham preached he
[58:55] breached Jesus Christ but that was his
[58:58] thing Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the
[59:01] same yesterday today and forever
[59:06] everybody said if I use his name I'm
[59:09] getting to heaven let me tell you
[59:10] something in the days of Jesus that was
[59:12] still using the name of Moses they were
[59:15] still using the name of Abraham and
[59:17] Jesus called them Devils hello he had to
[59:21] tell me for Abraham was I am
[59:23] oh god help us I know I'm making
[59:31] preachers mad but let me tell you
[59:36] something like this if you put all the
[59:38] Grace on brother Branham and fail to
[59:41] give yourself son
[59:43] you won't make it and there's so many
[59:46] people believe that they don't even know
[59:49] it need the Holy Ghost no more but I'm
[59:54] here you here to tell you your prophet
[59:56] had to get the Holy Ghost and he did and
[1:00:00] so do you now I'm working on the message
[1:00:03] right now this perfection because I want
[1:00:07] you to understand the perfection that
[1:00:09] God speaks up is not because of you
[1:00:12] you can't perfect yourself don't even
[1:00:15] try Pharisees thought they could perfect
[1:00:19] themselves and what they became still
[1:00:20] starchy and hateful
[1:00:25] it's the truth most religious spirits
[1:00:28] are hateful they mean just do one thing
[1:00:35] that they don't like they'll call you
[1:00:38] into question and they don't forgot
[1:00:42] they'd forgotten its mercy and grace
[1:00:45] that brought them this far you don't
[1:00:50] believe me the scripture proves it
[1:00:52] caught that lady in adultery brought in
[1:00:56] before Jesus that's why I say Devils
[1:00:58] don't always bring in a job a Saints
[1:01:00] don't always bring the church sometimes
[1:01:02] Devils drive you there but once once you
[1:01:08] get in the presence of God and you
[1:01:10] elected it's alright you don't care how
[1:01:12] you get there as long you get there
[1:01:14] there is a listen listening I want you
[1:01:16] to know I'm come on this is not him on
[1:01:18] my nose but he says listen he writes in
[1:01:21] the sand
[1:01:22] let him without sin cast the first stone
[1:01:25] and People of God if that's the way
[1:01:27] Jesus judged it then that's the way he
[1:01:30] judges it now
[1:01:33] is that right he's the same yesterday
[1:01:35] today and forever
[1:01:37] let him without sin cast the first Oh
[1:01:42] Hebrews 13 and eight yesterday today and
[1:01:45] forever the same hmm let me read this he
[1:01:48] is this okay now he goes on in he says
[1:01:51] Amen in the Hebrew he says by the Holy
[1:01:54] Spirit baptism we are baptized into that
[1:01:57] body and are free from sin God doesn't
[1:02:02] see you no more
[1:02:04] he only see Christ and when you in that
[1:02:08] body God can't judge that body
[1:02:12] he's already judged it Oh y'all come oh
[1:02:18] when it gives you the Holy Ghost the
[1:02:21] body is already judged so when you make
[1:02:24] mistakes
[1:02:25] you've been judged already and forgiven
[1:02:32] cuz he gave you the Holy Ghost somebody
[1:02:35] help me
[1:02:37] that holy ghost that seal cannot be
[1:02:40] broken the blood covers you is that
[1:02:45] right that's what the prophecy said when
[1:02:48] the blood is covering you God can't even
[1:02:51] see your sin so why are you looking at
[1:02:54] them hmm you know I'm telling you all
[1:03:02] y'all some of y'all lookin with them sad
[1:03:04] faces but y'all ought to be happy that
[1:03:08] God is setting you free
[1:03:09] I ain't choking and neither am i
[1:03:13] stuttering I know y'all understand it
[1:03:15] I'm trying to give you something that
[1:03:17] will liberate you
[1:03:20] you'll start listening to those tapes in
[1:03:23] a different way you'll start hearing the
[1:03:25] prophets voice in a different way you
[1:03:29] get to listening to those tapes and you
[1:03:30] won't be bored oh god I better listen to
[1:03:33] a tape today oh do you just all of a
[1:03:39] sudden just old god I better eat today
[1:03:41] some people forget to eat I don't you
[1:03:45] can tell that right I got a few friends
[1:03:48] of mine they thin too cuz they forget to
[1:03:50] eat but you see I don't forget to eat if
[1:03:54] anything I got to remind myself not to
[1:03:56] eat so much you know but that's the
[1:04:02] truth and that's how he is in a message
[1:04:05] some people in the message they forget
[1:04:07] to eat and then you find them being
[1:04:09] Christians spiritually right yeah I'm a
[1:04:16] fatted calf I could steer kick you know
[1:04:21] that's just the way it goes
[1:04:23] Amen here he said God don't see you no
[1:04:26] more he only sees Christ and when you in
[1:04:30] the body God can't judge the body
[1:04:33] he's already judged it he took our
[1:04:36] judgment and invited us in and by faith
[1:04:40] through grace we walk and accept our
[1:04:43] pardoning
[1:04:45] that's the key I always accept your
[1:04:47] pardoning always accept your forgiveness
[1:04:50] oh I don't get it too long and updated
[1:04:53] too much you could never do it too long
[1:04:55] you could never do it too much because
[1:04:58] when it gets too much God will stop you
[1:05:03] when I look at Samson anything you know
[1:05:05] how bad we don't we don't know what all
[1:05:07] Samson did but whatever he did got in a
[1:05:11] bad situation and all he had to do is a
[1:05:13] little lord once more and I believe that
[1:05:16] with all my heart
[1:05:17] those of us Amen who need a revival you
[1:05:19] need to cry out Oh Lord once more give
[1:05:22] me that revival give me that fire that I
[1:05:24] used to have hallelujah and when you in
[1:05:28] this body can't judge in the morn no sir
[1:05:31] and the Holy Spirit brings us into this
[1:05:34] fellowship with him and we walk no more
[1:05:37] after the things of the world but we
[1:05:40] walk in the spirit quicken the word came
[1:05:44] to us he died in my stead I'm made alive
[1:05:49] Here I am
[1:05:51] who wants who was once dead in sin and
[1:05:55] trespasses been made alot how do you
[1:05:58] know you made a lie how do you know my
[1:06:02] house you thirst for righteousness that
[1:06:05] thirst for righteousness skin you is a
[1:06:08] sign you are alive you can't be doing in
[1:06:14] thirsty at the same time but that's
[1:06:17] thirsting you for righteousness because
[1:06:19] no devil in hell is thirsting for
[1:06:22] righteousness only those who have been
[1:06:24] quickened to life thirst after
[1:06:27] righteousness and God said if you thirst
[1:06:29] after this righteousness you shall be
[1:06:32] filled
[1:06:35] hallelujah
[1:06:37] we walk and accept our pardoning and the
[1:06:39] Holy Spirit brings us into the
[1:06:40] fellowship and we walk to we and we walk
[1:06:44] no more after the things of the world
[1:06:46] but we walk in the spirit quickened the
[1:06:49] word came to us and that's what a lot of
[1:06:52] times people think well when I get first
[1:06:53] saved then I'm going everything drops no
[1:06:56] God got a sanctified
[1:06:58] you that's what people say oh I got the
[1:07:02] Holy Ghost yes in a portion cuz that
[1:07:05] portion brought you to life but you've
[1:07:07] got to be sanctified that same Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost is there become becomes your
[1:07:11] conscious that's wrong that's wrong you
[1:07:14] didn't say that right do that right
[1:07:16] where this where that that's God in you
[1:07:20] bring you where into perfection it's
[1:07:26] bringing you into perfection and just
[1:07:28] like in the message say to need and I
[1:07:30] think it was brother Keith that told me
[1:07:31] about it but it's true when you get to
[1:07:34] it there's a place you can get in God
[1:07:37] will God will veil you with such a holy
[1:07:41] veil to use these things that we see out
[1:07:44] in the world will not affect you at all
[1:07:50] it won't affect you you can see somebody
[1:07:53] naked or honest but you'll fail that God
[1:07:57] then place on you is so holy it will not
[1:08:00] affect you somebody help me here but if
[1:08:06] you still cover with the last value I
[1:08:08] don't care how holy you try to be you go
[1:08:11] continue to last last last last
[1:08:13] that means the veil must be changed whoa
[1:08:18] help me Jesus and the only way that veil
[1:08:22] can be changed is that God brings you
[1:08:24] from glory to glory to glory is that
[1:08:28] right you said all what are you saying
[1:08:31] don't you know that even brother Bradley
[1:08:32] had to wear a cross in front of his car
[1:08:36] to keep his holy veil to keep that veil
[1:08:42] holy somebody help me here see you know
[1:08:46] a lot of times people say the man went
[1:08:48] yes he was tempted just like everybody
[1:08:49] else you think why don't you come on
[1:08:52] people
[1:08:53] you think he was because he was such a
[1:08:55] man he didn't go through nothing he did
[1:09:00] why do you think it's all he said now
[1:09:02] listen he said certain things he could
[1:09:05] he said I couldn't never do cuz I love
[1:09:07] her so much so what was that love but
[1:09:09] the veil of God
[1:09:12] sighing love is the veil of God Oh help
[1:09:17] me Lord what was it he said listen and
[1:09:20] we walked we will walk no more after the
[1:09:23] things of the world but we walk in the
[1:09:24] spirit quicken the words quicken see
[1:09:27] Lester that's to keep quicken the world
[1:09:29] came to us he died in my stead
[1:09:32] I mean I made alive Here I am and that's
[1:09:35] the thing some of us we walking like we
[1:09:37] still dead but when Christ is in you you
[1:09:39] are alive and the Bible says there is no
[1:09:42] condemnation to those who walk not after
[1:09:44] the flesh but after the spirit so if you
[1:09:47] begin to walk after the spirit you may
[1:09:49] make mistakes but there is no
[1:09:51] condemnation hmm
[1:09:57] I'm almost done I gotta preach this
[1:10:01] evening he said my desires is to serve
[1:10:07] Him he said Here I am who was once dead
[1:10:13] in sin and trespasses been made alive
[1:10:16] all my desire is to serve Him how many
[1:10:20] of us can say that today oh my desire is
[1:10:24] to serve Him hallelujah is that Alright
[1:10:28] all my desire is to serve Him ooh that's
[1:10:34] pretty good all my love is to him all my
[1:10:38] walks want to be in his name that
[1:10:41] whenever I go wherever I go whatever I
[1:10:45] do i glorify him if I'm hunting if I'm
[1:10:50] fishing if I'm playing ball if whatever
[1:10:54] I'm doing I must be Christ in me in such
[1:10:59] a life that will make me long to be that
[1:11:02] way not tattling and backbiting and
[1:11:05] fussing about your churches whoa
[1:11:08] he said you get it one spirit we are
[1:11:12] baptized into that body and when I see
[1:11:15] the blood I'll pass over you
[1:11:19] see us Christ in you hallelujah Oh can I
[1:11:24] read another one he said if that could
[1:11:28] make the person perfect and God requires
[1:11:34] perfection they did couple it worked
[1:11:36] laws he said if keeping the laws if
[1:11:40] doing the commandments would make you
[1:11:42] perfect then there's no need there's no
[1:11:45] need of having anything else you've
[1:11:47] already made perfect because when you're
[1:11:50] perfect you're eternal in other words
[1:11:55] you are eternal God is the only one is
[1:11:58] eternal and God is the only one perfect
[1:12:02] and the only way you can be eternal is
[1:12:05] to become part of God this is what he
[1:12:09] said once purged no conscience of sin
[1:12:12] what the worshiper once purged - I have
[1:12:15] no conscience if you write the
[1:12:18] translation of that it's desire the
[1:12:22] worshiper once purged has no desire to
[1:12:25] sin now how many of us have desires to
[1:12:28] see it
[1:12:29] none of us that means God has purged you
[1:12:34] you and I don't willfully sin we do
[1:12:38] things out of weaknesses but glory to
[1:12:43] God thank you Jesus for the blood
[1:12:55] did you know brother Branham was telling
[1:12:57] that woman when he talked to her with
[1:12:59] the purply only that the blood was still
[1:13:01] protecting her back slidden is all
[1:13:04] get-out and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:07] was perfect
[1:13:08] for protecting her that's why we say oh
[1:13:11] this person you know they show
[1:13:13] backslidden and you could see God still
[1:13:15] taking care of him he always will it
[1:13:20] won't matter or they ought to die now no
[1:13:22] God don't care about what you think
[1:13:24] about it it's who he has declared as
[1:13:27] being sons and daughters of God he will
[1:13:30] Wayne's protective zone oh Jesus help me
[1:13:35] Lord
[1:13:35] is this okay and what we must understand
[1:13:40] that if you know that's that's the truth
[1:13:42] if you want to that's one of the true
[1:13:44] because you can't what what defines the
[1:13:48] Holy Spirit the evidence the Holy Ghost
[1:13:50] is living the life really that's what
[1:13:53] it's all about living the life brother
[1:13:57] had said when he said don't listen he
[1:13:59] said don't try to have any sensations or
[1:14:02] anything to take the place of the Holy
[1:14:05] Spirit when the new birth is calm he
[1:14:10] said when the new birth is calm you are
[1:14:12] changed you don't have to do anything to
[1:14:16] prove it your life proves it as you walk
[1:14:19] your love peace long-suffering
[1:14:23] gentleness meekness patience that's what
[1:14:26] you are and the whole world sees the
[1:14:30] reflection of Jesus Christ in you oh
[1:14:34] come on somebody hey you know I love to
[1:14:38] shout I love to dance
[1:14:39] I love tongues interpretation of tongues
[1:14:41] I love prophecy I love it all but you
[1:14:44] know the devil can do it all he can
[1:14:47] imitate all of that I'm not calling the
[1:14:50] Holy Spirit I'm telling the vessel could
[1:14:53] be a devil and still do it all hmm but
[1:14:57] the life the life of Christ only a true
[1:15:02] believer can live it will help me Jesus
[1:15:06] listen he said the Bible says come out
[1:15:10] of them be ye separate saith God see
[1:15:13] you're not of that and when that new
[1:15:16] nature comes in you you don't have to be
[1:15:19] pulled out you don't want to go back
[1:15:22] like Lot's wife you just born out of it
[1:15:27] you're born out of it right y'all get it
[1:15:33] and you're in or not this is part of
[1:15:36] like another dimension I like that
[1:15:39] because often time I feel that's just
[1:15:41] the way it is I'm just in another
[1:15:42] dimension I'm
[1:15:44] seeing things that other people ain't
[1:15:45] seeing I'm top of the world they don't
[1:15:47] see what I see this message is not a
[1:15:53] stumbling block to me this message
[1:15:56] taking me higher and higher and higher
[1:15:58] in Christ Jesus from glory to glory to
[1:16:02] glory in Christ Jesus
[1:16:05] hallelujah listen and he goes on and say
[1:16:09] listen he says you don't want to go back
[1:16:12] like Lot's wife you just born out of it
[1:16:15] and you're in another dimension and that
[1:16:18] looks trashy to you and this this great
[1:16:22] fabulous America that we live in has
[1:16:25] become one of the big chaos of it
[1:16:28] everything is lust in women and women
[1:16:31] the way they're dressing and the men the
[1:16:33] way they're acting and the things
[1:16:35] they're doing and then call themselves
[1:16:38] Christians so when a real Christian
[1:16:41] born-again Christian all this junk
[1:16:43] becomes trash to you I'm gonna stop here
[1:16:47] but I'm trying to bring something to you
[1:16:51] we must if we are the body of Christ
[1:16:54] Jesus Christ understand me he became our
[1:16:58] sin that we might become his
[1:16:59] righteousness and now the only body
[1:17:03] Jesus have is what what we see here and
[1:17:06] everywhere else those who are truly born
[1:17:08] again they are the body of Christ
[1:17:10] because the Bible says they are baptized
[1:17:12] into one body by one spirit and God
[1:17:20] justifies you then he sanctifies you
[1:17:24] then he feels you right so let me throw
[1:17:28] this at you he that begun the good work
[1:17:32] in you is faithful to completed why
[1:17:38] should I worry let me tell you all
[1:17:41] something if you don't know it doesn't
[1:17:45] matter when it comes to where we think
[1:17:51] somebody right or wrong
[1:17:55] it is just like let me say like this if
[1:18:00] we took the Old Testament and we go down
[1:18:02] to Old Testament you see all those who
[1:18:04] stood for Jesus who stood for God and
[1:18:07] how many mistakes they made now watch
[1:18:11] this because even even when it came to
[1:18:14] Naomi and Ruth in all them they were
[1:18:16] among idol worshippers a people ha ha
[1:18:22] how comfortable were they in a place
[1:18:25] where they were sacrificing babies
[1:18:29] Moloch and all of the rest you
[1:18:31] understand me
[1:18:32] and yet they still regard people in such
[1:18:37] a myth and at that opponent time God
[1:18:41] called them out all of us have been
[1:18:45] guilty we all in some way was a party we
[1:18:50] weren't in the Church of Laodicea we was
[1:18:53] part of the spirit of and God called all
[1:18:57] of us out why because we were his people
[1:19:00] and not one of us let me put it this way
[1:19:04] when you're baking cakes you have
[1:19:08] measuring cups right and those measuring
[1:19:14] cups is a set that you work with now I
[1:19:20] could take a a couple of a cup and
[1:19:23] measure what 1/2 a cup is or in my mind
[1:19:27] but no there's a designated size cup
[1:19:31] it's called 1/2 a cup you got 1/3 cup
[1:19:36] y'all understand what I'm saying my
[1:19:40] point is all of us may not be a full cup
[1:19:45] we may not be a whole cup we may be a
[1:19:48] half a cup but God gonna use you God
[1:19:51] gonna use the third and God gonna use
[1:19:53] he's in the baking process
[1:19:55] he's breaking bread y'all understand me
[1:20:00] I'm trying to tell you in other words we
[1:20:02] measure ourself there's no way I half a
[1:20:04] cup can become a whole cup
[1:20:08] yes I have up just make sure you're
[1:20:10] half a cup is full but some of y'all
[1:20:16] might be a little teaspoon or tablespoon
[1:20:21] but make sure you know when I when I
[1:20:24] measure it up y'all I y'all got when I
[1:20:26] measured so I make sure it's er easy
[1:20:28] it's right cuz when I measure right I
[1:20:32] know it's gonna come out right so what
[1:20:35] I'm trying to say is folks we are all
[1:20:37] different yet we are all alike and we're
[1:20:42] all here been placed to do what
[1:20:44] manifests Jesus Christ hallelujah and
[1:20:48] you've heard me say this many times I've
[1:20:51] gone to churches and and I'm cold and
[1:20:53] believe it or not I am I'm gonna make
[1:20:55] this one state man see having brother
[1:20:57] branham picture up here y'all know who
[1:21:00] I'm come on but if I were to stay having
[1:21:02] a pillow fire up here cuz you know
[1:21:03] that's the picture the pillar fire
[1:21:05] brother Brenda was just in the picture
[1:21:09] is that right
[1:21:10] brother Brown said he took his picture
[1:21:13] with me he does that I took my picture
[1:21:16] with him he took his picture with me
[1:21:20] and so many times people can get
[1:21:22] offended by this because they don't
[1:21:24] understand the revelation they don't
[1:21:26] understand what that light is that ain't
[1:21:29] something somebody colored in or
[1:21:31] coloured out that was God out of all the
[1:21:34] ages took a picture allowed a
[1:21:38] non-believer to take that picture to
[1:21:41] make him a believer we would have never
[1:21:45] known now I say like this some of y'all
[1:21:47] may have not seen the pill if I I've
[1:21:49] seen the pill afire more than once when
[1:21:53] I first came to the message I've seen
[1:21:54] the pillar fire so I don't have to
[1:21:57] wonder whether this is right I know it's
[1:21:59] right before I came to this message
[1:22:02] I saw Christ in a a dream he looked like
[1:22:08] that so I don't care so myself I don't
[1:22:12] believe he look like that
[1:22:13] I believe he's black with kinky hair
[1:22:19] my thing is who cares who cares he saved
[1:22:27] my life I wouldn't care if he was
[1:22:31] striped with polka dots I wouldn't care
[1:22:34] he saved my life I talked to a guy
[1:22:38] yesterday and you know he was biracial
[1:22:40] he started with this black stuff I say
[1:22:43] color on me nothing I kind of raised my
[1:22:46] voice a little bit
[1:22:47] I say colored on me nothing I say it's
[1:22:49] character that's what matters character
[1:22:54] they're bad people black bad people who
[1:22:57] write bad people amen sharpens coming
[1:23:00] every color if Jesus was black and kinky
[1:23:06] here what good is gonna do me I still
[1:23:08] got to be born again people so silly
[1:23:13] love with you I shouldn't say that but I
[1:23:18] say you know what I said you know I told
[1:23:20] y'all hope y'all don't mind me saying
[1:23:22] this I said the black people were
[1:23:24] deceived because they believed that the
[1:23:25] white man was superior and the white man
[1:23:28] was too DC because he believed he was
[1:23:30] superior why are you saying like that
[1:23:34] because my brother my prophet said there
[1:23:36] is no superior race and I believe what
[1:23:41] he says and a black man can give a black
[1:23:44] a white man blood transfusion and vice
[1:23:46] versa so whether you like it or not I'm
[1:23:50] all in the family it is the way it goes
[1:23:56] yo so what I'm trying to say let me get
[1:23:58] you this my point having these pictures
[1:24:02] even across shut up does not make us a
[1:24:07] message Church yeah and I come to be
[1:24:14] where y'all where's the pillar cloud we
[1:24:16] have to peel I heard a Brad a brother
[1:24:18] come to my church say you ain't in the
[1:24:20] messenger cuz you don't even have the
[1:24:21] cloud up I had years ago a man coming to
[1:24:27] my church in our church in South
[1:24:28] Carolina he walked in he said just don't
[1:24:30] look like a message Church come on what
[1:24:32] does
[1:24:33] Church look like he is he is come on
[1:24:41] somebody you gotta realize you the
[1:24:44] church you are the message eat the book
[1:24:49] eat the book and then prophesy again you
[1:24:57] know how honestly I do I get so tired of
[1:24:59] people with racial comments and all that
[1:25:02] I'm not prejudiced I've never been
[1:25:04] prejudiced right and and and and I was
[1:25:08] raised in our area where I should have
[1:25:10] been perhaps but one thing I am
[1:25:17] prejudiced about and that's Jesus Christ
[1:25:22] I'm here to glorify Him only if I got
[1:25:26] some Long's if I got some differences
[1:25:29] it's when I see and I get jealous and I
[1:25:33] like I told her brother the other day I
[1:25:34] don't care if you say brother branham
[1:25:36] name 1000 times as long as you say Jesus
[1:25:40] Christ mm the name of William Branham
[1:25:47] doesn't stumble me cuz I know who he is
[1:25:51] but I get him I get something you know I
[1:25:53] was telling the brother say if I was
[1:25:54] sitting in the audience I would have
[1:25:56] known who you was talking about but I
[1:26:00] need to after hearing you preach I need
[1:26:03] to know who you were talking about
[1:26:05] well you talking about Jesus Christ Oh
[1:26:08] were you talking about just the Prophet
[1:26:10] now I don't care if you bring them
[1:26:12] together just bring them together give
[1:26:18] me a full picture that's all I'm saying
[1:26:21] don't make it once I did bring the Jesus
[1:26:25] Christ in there like Paul did that
[1:26:28] brother branham did is that right I know
[1:26:31] I'm sounding crazy but I'm saying it
[1:26:33] gotta be Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:26:35] what brought me brother Brandon was
[1:26:37] Christ in him and what makes you would
[1:26:40] be Christ in you otherwise you're
[1:26:42] finished you love the Lord the the man
[1:26:47] but Christ Jesus must become you let's
[1:26:50] stand you know I I know people don't
[1:27:00] understand I'm trying I can't get grant
[1:27:02] you revelation that's Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:27:05] is the only one that can give us a
[1:27:06] revelation and what I'm saying is not
[1:27:07] indeed it ain't deep it's just there
[1:27:11] right in your face been there all the
[1:27:14] time but I tell you where we where we
[1:27:18] men aren't when we went off and there
[1:27:20] was a time when brother Branham lived
[1:27:22] their message was God sent a prophet we
[1:27:28] never changed it you understand me
[1:27:32] because at that day and time he needed
[1:27:34] to know right come see the man you
[1:27:41] understand me and that was all right
[1:27:43] because Christ was in it but then when
[1:27:46] Jesus died and he rose again Paul said
[1:27:49] we don't know no man after the flesh
[1:27:51] anymore only Christ the God that was in
[1:27:55] Jesus that's when we come to know and
[1:27:58] that's what we need to know that God
[1:28:01] that was in William Branham is what we
[1:28:03] need to know who he who we need to know
[1:28:05] we need to know Jesus him that one that
[1:28:08] was in him the one who broke up every
[1:28:10] revelation did you know that one time
[1:28:13] the prophet of God believed in Trinity
[1:28:15] Oh in the Old Testament in the old tapes
[1:28:20] he believed in Trinity who broke the
[1:28:24] revelation to him it was God see if
[1:28:29] people say oh I believe every word he
[1:28:31] said well at that time he was right with
[1:28:33] what he understood but he was
[1:28:35] progressive in his revelation I'm not
[1:28:38] here to question anything I'm just
[1:28:40] saying I know that I'm getting the
[1:28:42] portion of the message I'm supposed to
[1:28:44] get they got what they were supposed to
[1:28:47] get I'm getting what I supposed to get
[1:28:48] you're getting what you're supposed to
[1:28:50] get hmm I think people just so concerned
[1:28:55] about just dumb stuff dumb people
[1:29:00] arguing about
[1:29:01] where the bridge didn't collapse and the
[1:29:03] people didn't die who cares who cares
[1:29:09] they say he wasn't there when when the
[1:29:12] cane just showed up in the I say let me
[1:29:14] tell you something let me give you one
[1:29:15] answer for that when people bring that
[1:29:17] nonsense to you ask them were you at
[1:29:21] Phillips revival I know you saw him
[1:29:25] there but did you see Philip when he
[1:29:31] disappeared and went into the desert and
[1:29:34] then he came back and said don't you
[1:29:36] know what I was just in the desert
[1:29:38] I just preached through the unit he was
[1:29:40] old no ain't no way feeling I just saw
[1:29:42] you five minutes ago you understand me
[1:29:46] if he said he was there he was there
[1:29:49] it ain't listen what I'm trying to say
[1:29:51] is there were so many supernatural
[1:29:53] elements happening during that time how
[1:29:55] you gonna say he wasn't there explained
[1:30:00] to me if y'all go up to finger are that
[1:30:04] finger point up in Arizona
[1:30:06] tell me how that man got up on that
[1:30:07] mountain old man there are mysteries so
[1:30:14] let me say like this thing that only the
[1:30:16] spiritual mind would catch because when
[1:30:18] people kind of tell me that over here
[1:30:19] under there I said what Moses wasn't
[1:30:22] there either but he wrote all the Old
[1:30:23] Testament he was a prophet they saw what
[1:30:31] let me tell you what he said Enoch Moses
[1:30:34] Noah saw Enoch and what they had two
[1:30:37] timelines I say hello
[1:30:39] so as we umbrella Eve and he said he saw
[1:30:43] Eve what do you think he dropped those
[1:30:47] things in there for so we can see that
[1:30:50] if it's the latter it'll kill you but
[1:30:52] it's the spirit that gives life and we
[1:30:56] saw easy saw E and if Moses saw the
[1:31:00] creation throw the Bible away then
[1:31:01] because you gotta rest in faith
[1:31:04] somewhere and if inna a boat nor saw
[1:31:10] Enoch he saw him he was a prophet
[1:31:14] brother ban who says tada boy who had
[1:31:17] those look blue jeans on he says oh yeah
[1:31:18] you live in this house the baby got a
[1:31:20] little blue jeans and when I when the
[1:31:23] Lord healed him he have this chocolate
[1:31:24] milk or some kind of milk around his
[1:31:26] mouth and everything and anyways the
[1:31:28] daddy said brother have you been there
[1:31:30] you've been at my house before he said I
[1:31:33] was just there a few minutes ago Oh
[1:31:36] somebody help me here he said just a few
[1:31:39] minutes he said there's some kind of he
[1:31:41] said there's a spirit that takes me day
[1:31:47] these are intellectual demons trying to
[1:31:51] make the saints of God out you just take
[1:31:53] trust God and God to bring you out folks
[1:31:55] a while when he made mistakes I said let
[1:31:57] me tell you something he is so in the
[1:31:59] Bible all through Revelation the seven
[1:32:04] angels doing every kind of stuff I said
[1:32:07] he made it on his air I'm holding tight
[1:32:13] cuz if he made it I'm making it too
[1:32:15] right that's right I ain't letting it go
[1:32:19] to your bless me so I you know these
[1:32:21] people they just they ordained to be
[1:32:24] this way don't let nobody turn your mind
[1:32:28] against this message it's 100 percent
[1:32:31] right whether you can understand it or
[1:32:33] not it ain't about that is believing it
[1:32:35] have faith that God didn't make no
[1:32:38] mistake when he sent Malachi 4 and the
[1:32:41] word that he preached is Jesus Christ
[1:32:44] and that message will get you into the
[1:32:46] gate it's by grace you know you love the
[1:32:51] Lord everybody you said what brothers
[1:32:53] like you said everybody can't hear let
[1:32:54] me a little a little a little a little
