TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for whatever reason God uh allowed me to leave a page of my notes out from this morning and I kept looking and I'm thinking something's missing and then when I got back to my office I found out what was missing so I really believe by the grace of God this is what God would have us to minister on this evening same thing I'm working with I'm not a conqueror when we when we look at that and as we said this morning we know who the Conqueror is and the first thing that God must do because he is the second Adam and God told Adam the first Adam to do everything so we are of God's inheritance and he has been charged over us that's what the word of God said he's God Over All Flesh and so therefore he is the god that is to sedu to us y'all hear me but it must come even as Adam's uh labor would have been only by the spoken word that is the only way God can subdue you is by the spoken word he subdue and bring all order to his creation by the voice of his word is that right or the word of his voice is that all right so let us um go back by the grace of God Amen and we're just going to read 1 John 4:4 uh where it reads ye are are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen let us pray father God we come before you as humbly as we know how and we just so thank you for your grace and your mercy God you're better to me that I've been to myself and no matter what Lord I know your voice I hear your voice and I know how to respond father and God we come to do thy perfect will and we pray that your will be done here this evening in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you know because we must realize and and like I said earlier God is God is obvious you know uh he is all around us he above us he's in us he's through us you know and I was thinking uh today and I'm going to tell you this uh whether some Of You' noticed and maybe some of you haven't noticed but uh my daughter a couple of them have been wearing those High here shoes I had to call them in the office this morning and told them we can't do that here and uh I also uh told him you know uh one not to bring her baby to church with with with pants on you know and and uh coold and no cold they did they they were able to do without him when they didn't have a furnace or a heater you know they say a child don't know but a child do know and I just know that by the grace of God uh for whatever reason it just seems like the enemy uh uh challenges CH uh channels my family uh to to embarrass uh the ministry or bring a reproach and let me tell you something people of God you know God knows what you got on and he knows what you're wearing and and you better understand by the grace of God that those things hinder the Serv Serv it might seem small but a little fox spil the vine now you know and and we don't have any deacons so it look like I'm going to have to be the Deacon you understand me so that means you're going to see a nice part of me and then you're going to see a patrol part right the P Patrol part is there so I want you to realize by the grace of God that's not legalistic the Bible said train up a child in way they should go and even so when they little you ought to get them down to pray with you now I say this by the grace of God my even when it come to rebuking the church I am the brother said the Pastor is the is the head authority of the church when it comes to rebuking that's where it comes from right anything else is out of order you understand me so when it comes to those things correcting the church that's what we do uh when it comes to uh counseling always counsel in canceling Services understand I pray about those things it is a very difficult thing for me to do but I try to keep everybody in mind even the other day when I did Council service I actually came down here from my house and the road was pretty slippery so I just thank God for just uh bearing witness I wanted to make sure I had done the right thing uh saints of God there's no joy and pleasure in doing that but even so when you see that we do have service look how many come we're not but a small group but it just seemed like there are not those who can be really dedicated dedication is something that is precious in this day and hour and I think that we need to learn how how to be dedicated all of us in everything that we uh say we're going to do for God it is called a sacrifice and that's what we're working on by the grace of God we're working with being being a Living Sacrifice amen because we remember I said this morning that the only way that uh uh you can be a more than a conqueror is that you must allow the Holy Spirit to conquer you right amen and I'm going to read by the grace of God what brother bam says in the token message and this is what I left out this morning or by God's will he allowed it to be so he said now notice I'm sorry this is coming from covenant God's COV Covenant when God called Abraham he called for a total separation separate yourself from your Kinsmen separate your yourself from your father's house separate from all your Associates and completely annihilate yourself from all these things and walk with me and brother brandham said it like this as God dealt with Abraham he also deals with Abraham's children is that all right what a privilege it is when a man is being called like that how happy a real Christian is to separate himself how happy a Christian is a real Christian how happy a real Christian because that was the quote I looked up real Christian real go not Fool's Go real go and I'm going to tell you something if you think about it right now it is our own our families that are literally draining the virtue taking The Virtue from you because you won't cut yourself loose we got to let them go we can't save them the part is the truth of the matter is if they're bride they'll come forth if they're not they won't and that's it so you and I must realize and recognize by the grace of God our greatest hindrance just like lot Miss lot she had a a a interest in her loved ones at a time she she should have let it go right y'all hear what I'm saying true sacrifice listen no matter how much we love him God didn't already promised us by the grace of God he'll wipe the tears from our eye brother Bram said that is when God will cause you forget that you ever knew them so there'll be not a moment of sadness in heaven in your mind God will wipe away your mind those loved ones that didn't make it so that you could be eternally happy can you imagine knowing that you in this blissfulness and knowing your loved was in hell you couldn't be happy so God has to come and wipe away all that why are you worried we all do it we all come to a place amen we allow our in our loved ones to pull to take away from us we're trying to move forward and many of us will miss the Rapture because of it that's the word of a prophet separate yourself and he says Abraham beside all of this I am I've already settled it and I'm going to make a covenant with you isn't it right that we even have loved ones that'll be Lites instead of Abraham mites right there will always remain lukewarm and ain't nothing you can do about it and God had to bring to a place where he had to separate Abraham and lot God had to do it cuz because Abraham couldn't don't you worry God will make it right he said you'll be the father of every nation and I'm going to make a covenant with you and your seed and you're coming to me in an old age there's no doubt about it and you're going to be a great work for me and besides I'm going to give you a child by Sarah your wife through him all Nation shall be blessed now I'm going to read another one by the grace of God you see we looking we we're in a in an age right now where Faith must come first God's we must believe folks we got to I'm speaking to I'm talking from myself I see where Satan has fought me I see where Satan has duped me in so many things amen not not uh but God allowed it God allowed it that I might see down the road at a perfect time right now the lamb was obedient to the Dov see no matter where it led it was willing to go I wonder today when God leads us uh to a life of complete surrender and service to him I wonder if our spirit then sometimes don't Rebel kind of showing that wonder if we are lamb see a lamb is obedient a lamb is selfs sacrificial it doesn't it doesn't take claim its own you can lay it right down and Shear the wolf off of it the W off of it that's the only thing is God it'll never say anything about it just sacrifice everything is God hallelujah that's why we come to church and we must realize it's not about us it's about him God is to get the glory god is to get the glory that a lamb it gives everything to it gives everything away itself and all it is everything away and all it is help us Lord and that's the new the way a real Christian is they if they self-sacrifice themselves caring nothing for this world but giving all they got to God see now this is a perfect lamb Christ was and then through the shed of this lamb uh the N natural lamb in Egypt the blood was applied and when it was it stood for a token then what would be what the blood of this lamb stands for see the token that we are dead to ourselves and identified with our sacrifice then the lamb and the and the blood and the person becomes identified together the sacrifice and the believer SE you identified in your life by your sacrifice let me put it in in in these terms a full worship a true worship amen of God in you is when the characteristics of God are on display that is the token let me say it like this again real worship 100% worship pure worship I'm not talking about praise because everything can praise God let everything that have breath praise God but when it comes to worship His Life his mannerism what he will do and what he won't do amen is in you and is on this play it is not setting up on the Shelf saying I'm going to pull it out some of these old days but it is where people can see it because Jesus said I am the light of the world then he comes around and says but now ye are the light of the world a city that that's on a hill there must be a difference in our lives and our character and if it's not you hear what I'm saying in order to worship God in his fullness you must display his character there's the that's the simplest way I can say it then the blood was a token of our remember because brother brandham said in the Old Testament when those lambs and things were slain what was the issue he said that blood could only cover them the life of that lamb was not compatible with the life of a man so what was the life about so therefore when the lamb TR Lamb of God was slain his life could come back now was it just to set on your shoulder no it was to display itself through you it was to make manifest that a true Lamb of God was slain and now the light that you once live you live no longer he's living in you and you are dead the blood identified that that the worshipper had had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb and applied the token to himself that he was not ashamed he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it and it was a place in such a position that everybody passing by CU see that token see many people wants to CH be Christians and they like to do it secretly so nobody would would know that they're Christians or the association they run around with some of them would think well now look I want to be a Christian but I don't want so and so to know about it see well now you see that's not Christianity Christianity has to display its token publicly in public life at the office on the street when Tru trouble is around anything in church everywhere else the blood is the token and the token must be applied or is not even the Covenant is not in effect woo help us Lord if the if if the blood has not been applied the Covenant is not in effect the blood was a token or an identification identifying this person has been redeemed now why notice they were redeemed before before there was anything had ever happened by faith they applied the blood seed before it actually happened the blood was applied by faith believing that it was going to happen the wrath of God passed through the land and the blood had to be applied first it was too late after the Wrath had done Fallen you see where we are glory to God ain't God good to us now I'm working with this because if we're going to be more than a conqueror we've got to come to a place amen that we are as I said displaying his character oh I was so happy when that brother came uh brother Gabe and he showed us that it was all right to be angry and sin not how many of y'all at times when you get angry the devil say see you wrong and you knew you was right and it's okay to be angry but the Bible said when you're angry sin not God was angry God has I could never put that together for whatever I could not put together how God could get angry at time and destroy this and destroy that if it was sin for us how come it you see what I'm saying so God allowed us to see that anger is okay when went in the spirit of righteousness Hallelujah is that all right you know I think that's when brother B said don't don't whip your children in anger I believe she he's working with the wrong kind Vengeance but there is a righteous anger amen that you chastise your children to correct them in is that all right now I'm going tell you something that happened in a to a church to a brother up there in New York there was a split in his church and God told him not to speak to this brother until he repented it was I got how many years five six years he would see this brother in public and the brother could be right there and he had to turn his back and not speak he said oh brother Brooks he said the pain that he was inflicted with me because he had to he had to marck the brother and and turn his back to him but because of that down the road years later the brother repented and all the people that left him came back to him him see he was obedient to God even though he suffered a pain he loved the brother he never stopped loving the brother but to make a long story short that same brother who took the people and his wife now that brother and his wife is out in the world see what I'm saying but that was all for the people God knew who the brother was but he was also helping him gain the Sheep back now his church is full all over again see it sometime it's difficult Amen to do those things that are righteous but often time we have to in order to save the look oner is that right you see when it comes to God as I said the Bible say he that taketh not his cross and fall after me he's not worthy of me and the cross is suffering folks you got to suffer for not because of your wrongdoing but because of the Cross we can't compromise even with the message y'all understand me we suffer for it but it's okay we have a crown Romans 8:18 says for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us I think it was brother Randy that told me this and this is maybe it maybe maybe not if the people understood those who are in hell right now that they was going to be living there longer than they were on Earth they would have have made a better choice somebody told me that maybe he looking at me that it was maybe it wasn't if he can't remember normally it is more than likely it wasn't him but my point is we look at this life as if it's long this is short this is a short period of time maybe it was who was it I can't remember but think about how long those people been in the grave and they traded that they traded Eternal eye for that it makes no sense because now most people have been in the grave longer much longer in years they've been there than they ever lived on the earth and they had rather spend hell time in Hell than in heaven think about it it doesn't make sense but if they could only understand oh I don't want to suffer for being a Christian I don't want to suffer I don't want people to know I don't hello you going to suffer for being a devil you might as well suffer for being a Christian if that makes sense you might as well suffer to be a Christian this is a short time James said it's like a vapor oh I think about Steve Bell right now I can see him with his hair you know cuz he didn't have no hair on his head he didn't have no hair you know what the polo uh scarlet fever took all his hair and everything out he didn't have nothing just smooth skin maybe a few strands I can remember the time when I was down there in Florida and he had a wig on and he thought it was the funniest thing and so did I it was so hot that day he said brother boo when I came out of church I took that wig and threw it in the trash a red when a blonde whatever it was but you know there was something calling for hair brother B said he didn't lose one said wherever they were they're still there now he's got them hallelujah oh I can't hardly wait to see my brother hallelujah oh my oh oh it's just truth it's the truth you know he had to wear false teeth and then he couldn't do them either but by the grace of God he won't have to wear false teeth there he got his Originals hallelujah oh people isin't that wonderful you think about it the suffering of this world cannot be compared to the things God has in store it's worth it all how can I say it Lord when you think about contracts when you got two people in a contract you they kind of want all the benefits to be equal equally shared but think about this I want you to understand nothing we have ever done could ever Merit anything from God if if Jesus Christ is not the motive and the objective for every everything you and I do it will be burned and destroyed in the fire you'll be saved but only the works that were done in the name of the Lord Jesus Will Stand everything else will be Tried by fire is that okay as I said this morning if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost a lot of people don't understand what that means you could be sitting right up in a message church hearing a preacher preach the message and still not comprehend or understand one thing that is being said you're wondering in your mind why can't I understand why can't I get up zus and things you you know what is it that that's not happening most of the time is this mental block here this thing here amen the fact that you haven't died to yourself is that all right as I said this morning brother banam rebuked the storm amen but then he comes along and explain to the people I didn't do it he did it he spoke to me and he told me what to do I did what he said is that all right the same God now I'm talking I I've been praying I have been you know there's something that that's got to break forth in in my soul something God wants me to do and and and and and I'll be honest with you it's really getting the it it's really doing I can't explain my emotions behind it but but sometimes I feel like I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm just about to lose my mind if I don't hurry and get to this place and and it's a powerful place it's a place where I know God is going to do something and at the same time you got the devil on the other end accusing and saying well how can this thing be you know that God has chosen you to do this that and the other I don't know but I do know that brother bandam said God always do those unusual things and right now you know it just you know uh it's just a real uh place to be uh uh but but I trust God and I know God is going to bring us through I didn't come to Iowa uh for nothing I believe that God sent me here but right now it and I'm going to tell you how I feel I feel like there's so many people quitting I feel like there's so many people giving up I feel like I'm I'm almost by myself and that's not a good way a place to be and yet it is because that's the only way God could get Moses that's the only way God could get any true servant of God is to bring him to themselves by themselves so I'm not complaining by the way I just I want you to understand I need need your prayers right now and I need your support but you know uh God because I tell you what this ministry can't be effective if you don't believe in it if you don't believe in the ministry that God has sent here whatever I preach it's not going to do you any good it it won't and I find out that there's a great percentage of the people that come here don't even respect me as a pastor so how is it going to work that's right sister Jesus I realized there was Moses had so many people that didn't respect him but he got the work done amen now who is living in you as I said this morning it must be the Holy Ghost it's got to be Jesus Christ on the inside I wish I could stand up in here and say I'm God but I'm not yet I am because he's in me not that I've made myself that he chose me to be that like he chose you to be that this nation or this nation was raised up so that we would be exalted in other words Satan Eden was prean it was made by God Allowed by God to be as dark as it is see God has to show a comparison he has to show something that that that how can say uh uh uh if there wasn't there had to be a sinner before there could be a saint you know in other words someone in before could God could heal somebody had to be sick he's a god of contrast so how can you express the bride at a evening time he had to allow it to get dark midnight has to come and then he preached a message and talks about the darkness Before Dawn that is the hour of the bride before right now the darkness is gathered against you is it gathered against me it's trying to stop the will of God but let me say it like this there's no amount of Darkness that can how can I say that can defeat the smallest amount of light is that okay so I want you to understand we don't we don't fear that we're going to be overcome by the darkness we're at a place in our lives we just want to do his perfect will whatever that might be Romans 9:17 is that all right for the scripture says unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and my name might be declared throughout all the Earth is that is that all right I put in uh parenthesis USA he raised his bride up that she would declare God the will of God is that your that you you Triumph in Victory that's his will not that we fail not that we come short God has placed it as a a in a position that we would Triumph oh come on somebody is that the word absolutely the Bible said he causes us to Triumph God does how we going to Triumph we've got so many people that don't even believe in the name of Jesus when I was there at Harmony I could see people getting upset with me because I was singing there ain't no other name Jesus Jesus no other name under the heaven could save us and I'm telling you I had people distant themselves from me you know I saw that and I questioned the Lord what was that about he brought that song back to my mind what I had just finished saying no other name under Heaven can save us and I don't care what the message people believe there's no other name under the heaven that can save us outside of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah don't you know if there was power in the name of William brandom he would have used it and he said that he he over there in Africa he said in the name of William brandham in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and then when he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Laughter] boom amen so we going to try to hurry up by the grace of God ain't God good to us amen so let's look at this now this is what I love because this is where the power is it's in the name woo I said listen listen you know uh snowblower you going to work I I was determined and when I hit that button I said Lord I believe you know what I was determined to stay out there all night and punch that button until it start cuz I knew God was more than able that devil say you keep pushing this button it's going to explode on you I said well it have to in my mind I said it's going to have to explode cuz I'm going keep hitting amen that's the determination you got to have is that all right amen St John 16:24 say hither to you ask nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your what Joy may be full that's what happened I asked and God made my joy full I was really happy like I said I was so happy I even did the next door neighbors amen so when you you look and you see what God is doing and just think about I think it was in the uh uh pergamus age indeed married he said amen he says listen you I have and has born and have patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted you know there was always a small group laboring for the name for the name not just the message the name because the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the message revelation of Jesus Christ that's how it starts off Hallelujah and he brings out through the church ages the name must remain the name right so they label with this they label with this and listen what happens the Bible says amen that anpus was my faithful model who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth brother said where Satan dwelleth was what that that Satan had moved his seat to pergamus that's where he was working from pergamus didn't went to fully roam but the where he really started was in pergamus the seed of Satan and the seed of Satan the the the the thing was was to drown out the name of the Lord Jesus come on even in this message you got the same thing you got to conquer that you got to conquer of that you got to overcome that I don't care if they don't love you they don't like you but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is The Only Name whereby we must be saved yes they'll kill you they'll put you out of their Circle so what sitting in Satan's sea you know what antibus mean I looked it up it means not against all not against all that means there was a little bit left a few people left that God was not against but for the most part he was against all because they all am me joining Lee y'all remember Constantine he wasn't a Christian yesterday and he ain't one today no matter what the Catholics say hallelujah y' oh my God think about it I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou H has a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name you have a little strength remember every demon of every Church age is fighting us now Sevenfold and the devil say you ain't nothing come on and he got to pull out seven of them to try to put you down and the devil say you ain't nothing you're more than what you think you are you're the true seed of God that God is trying to awaken or Quicken or bring you to life that you can be just like him oh but I tell you what the devil got a good whing coming he don't know it yet and I tell you what you'll be just like Gideon you know fighting and whooping those thinking the whole time I didn't even know I could do this amen but that was God in him God had to convince him you're a Mighty Man availer and think about this people The Best For Last I love this because yes it seemed like you you're weak sometime but only you could have taken the Mind battles of this age no one else could have done it no other age could take this they would be in the insane asylum right now huh oh yeah think about it people are flipping out all day every day nowadays killing each other cutting them off all kinds of stuff and you walk inane W come on somebody amen why cuz you and I have been taught turn the head you learn to turn it the right way right you turn the head amen and as like I said once you it's like any habit Once you turn your head long enough all of a sudden you don't even see what's around you Hallelujah thanks be to God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and make manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place make manifest the savior of his knowledge in every place how by revealing himself in you through others that they might see Christ and glorify God is that all right listen he said in the word of God I want you to understand we've got to begin to really study his word try to commit it to memory uh and everything into your heart because this is what he says and and the word of God will defeat Satan any place anytime anywhere and on any condition that's right that's what it is it's God's word and God in his word is the same you speaking how that's possible brother that I can speak God out of my mouth he and his word is the same so when you speak his word you're speaking God out of your mouth and when God comes out of your mouth he comes out in action that's the real Superman listen I hope this is okay amen he says now that shows you that you can defeat Satan on on the word of God no matter the word of God would defeat Satan any place anywhere under any condition if it's in the belly if it's in the belly of the well or if it's in the Lion's Den or on the bed with the cancer or laying Yonder bleeding to death in an autal accident the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere and the weakest Christian can use it woo so if you think you're the weakest Christian you still can use it it's your god-given privilege to do it see some people should have been here and they're not here they missing their meal notice there's a man an old fisherman who came to him by the name of Simon Peter his name was Simon and when he came he the strange thing about it Jesus yesterday he knew who he was and he told him what he was his name was St John the first chapter Thou Art Simon and your father's name is Jonas what do you think that the old fisherman with the greasy apron on thought when Jesus a man that had never seen him told him what his name was and what his daddy's name was and that was kind of strange and I'm going to give you another name I'm going to call you Peter which is by interpreted a little Stone now this how could I say it like this now if that was the case don't you think God also changed your name he changed your name even before your character has been changed because he knows your character will be changed right amen God called him Abraham before he his character had ever fully changed he was circumcised way before his character ever changed and God worked him and worked him and worked him and worked him you better believe a lot of things were left out hey we probably don't know half the things Abraham didn't do but God just dropped a few nuggets so that we can see that Abraham wasn't always obedient he never doubted but he didn't always do the right thing like we do y'all hear what I'm saying amen So You Realize by the grace of God God is still moving and I'm trying to wrap it up because I want you to understand you're not a conqueror you're more than a conqueror you're not barely making it you done hurdled this thing oh my by that much can you measure that is that all right that's why oh you know I had this thing in here I I'll be I'll know that we got the victory when we come in here worshiping like we ought to I don't care if it's a slow song it's fast song it doesn't matter I guarantee you you know we can always tell amen because brother brand you remember brother BR was sitting in the seat of the scornful he said those women come in his in this day you see y'all ain't heard no real worship until you can hear somebody play that old scrub board how many ever heard that oh my goodness that's real music amen and they had those little whatever they had put together to play those things and I'm telling you he said oh my God they done turn my church into a juice joint amen and you can see that woman now I don't mean no harm folks but in this old message we had got to the place you know in order to worship you got to be like this you got to be like this you know what to the pure all things are pure it's where your mind is y'all hear what I'm saying amen that's why Saul daughter looked at David said oh you you ill Fame you you like the children of Bal you moving too much you done took your clothes off Dancing before the Lord and God said this man is a man after my own heart Hallelujah come on somebody let me tell you something they used to sang a song in the world called Twist and Shout y'all remember that where do you think uhh Elis got all that from he got it from church he added his little thing and the reason why it came filthy because he was under the spirit of lust instead of the spirit of the Holy Ghost people are afraid to even move nowadays and sometimes I think to myself Lord am I moving too much and the times I've act I thought that I get to moving more Hallelujah I don't know what it's going to be like there in heaven but it won't be that kind of thought ever into anybody else's mind I can roll and kick it up and everything else and nothing will be thought about just I see honestly I've gone I've gone and you know how you see little commercials and things when you on your internet and stuff I'm like oh my God they worshiping now in a football game in a basket they're worshiping they jumping like the sons of God ought to be jumping Satan has taken our own and given it to the world and we sitting up here like cardboard boxes what's wrong with us yes we got to take back what God gave to us that's ours they worshiping oh come on because you know what Satan was there he knew he knows rather how the true sons of God worship God and he comes right down here and mimics and that's what brother say he ain't nothing but a mimic right those old Pentecostal people out there now I know they done gone too far with some of that stuff but the truth of the matter is how can you be decent when you're worshiping God in that sense think about it people are the brother back there I was preaching he's amen he look around why it should have been that everybody else should have been as excited as he was he didn't know whether he was in place or out of place this morning he was in place he was he was really there and and you know he almost called himself Lord he done been down somebody else's church but I got to call him and said brother you can let your hair down here you can run if you want them right amen because amen listen when I read this last week oh clap your hands all ye people Shout with unto God with the voice of Triumph you can't even get message people to clap their hands cuz they don't have Victory more or less shout you shout you Pentecostal well then God must be because he told me to do huh come on somebody I was telling somebody the other day I said what do you think who was who was moving David who was moving David if God said David is a man after my own heart that meant God was in David's heart making him do what he did at that time when David was worshiping God he and David had God had become when the man was totally out of his mind no king would ever done that no King but here we are by the grace of God you said brother you trying to pump me up people let me tell you something well you know you I and this is true me and a brother almost got into a little argument out there Harmon in the desert cuz he trying to tell me I'm different and he trying to tell me black people different from white people when it come to worship I said well it all depends on where you go I said cuz over here in America I I said they they throwing each other all in the air at the Rock concert they can shake their head in the way I can't shake it y'all understand me that is ridiculous I said maybe it was last year but it ain't this year now y'all hear what I'm saying culture ain't got nothing to do with this go to a football game or a basketball game and see how people act you know what I laugh at y'all excuse me but I laugh at a black man who can't dance now that's strange to me it's but there are plenty ain't got nothing to do with it you know if you ever want to dance You Can Dance that's the truth now let me move on by the ch God I hope I went off on little tangent but I can't help it you know I get to this place I got all of this thing bottled up in me and I just like Lord what it is I'm feel stifled sometime and I can't hardly stand that you know because I'm the preacher and I don't want you to catch my spirit but I sure want to release it oh God help me Jesus Oh My listen let me move on listen praise uh the praise of his glory look what it says here excuse me people when we look at this thing and we see amen that the M Majestic of the king of majestic Majestic which belong to him as a supreme ruler now I I'm saying you going to come before a supreme ruler I mean even in the Old Testament they they a natural King they carry on yeah I mean you ever seen Hitler the whole crowd goes up and look when they inaugurate Obama How They carried on these are men that's going to die and vanish and here we got our King in our midst oh there's got to be more noise than this there will not ever be a quiet soul in heaven I'm going tell you something if you think that you going to sit there and lean back like you're doing now and expect that you're going to be that way no it ain't going to happen you're not first of all you insult a king if you come before him and you don't bow that's that's an audience for head cuts off cut take your head off Hallelujah come on somebody in that audience you know you look at this thing you say Oh Brother Where are you working with I'm saying yes we come the reason why amen that we're not more than a conqueror is because we're not praising the Conqueror when David amen conquered the Goliath and you know when David killed 10,000 uh they said Saul a thousand David 10,000 y'all hear what I'm saying what was it there was a worship and hear your kingdom destroyed every work of the devil and there's no worship God said he inhabits the praise of his people is that right he inhabits so you don't want God in your midst don't praise him then don't ask God what's wrong with me don't ask God why my prayer are not being answered don't ask God why I don't feel you because you're not praising him and the Bible tells me even the prophet of God said when you talk about him he gets closer he draws nearer the more you call his name he comes close we're not using it the the weapon that God you see what word brother let me say it like this if you would do that I guarantee you the devil will leave you uhuh the devil will leave you hay 2:7 says and I will shake all Shake All Nations and the desire of Nations shall come and I will fill this house with his with Glory not some brick building this house I will fill this house with glory is that the truth that's what he said he said the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former what they had on Pentecost will not compare to what God has for us it must be greater or it's not the real thing aah 2:9 the glory of this Lou house should be greater than the glory of the farmer said the Lord of host and in this place I will give peace said the Lord of hosts I'm almost done Psalm 69:13 says but as for me my prayers unto thee Oh Lord in an acceptable time oh God in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation huh look what he says amen and the mighty conqueror I'm almost done he said the mighty conqueror he died a witness to the Earth to witness to the prophets a 33 year old man he conquered the cross he conquered the shame he conquered every devil and when he was dying Jehovah God turned his face in on him and he died alone forsaken by God and man let me back that up so y'all understand what I'm talking about my wife used to go to a UPC Church there in Kansas is that right that's right I mean anybody nobody could worship like Progressive I mean when we would when the word of God would come and the music would play and the song saying I mean 99.9% of the people were shouting we talking about 300 or so more people shaking the balcony and everything and I thought my it couldn't get no better than this amen I go to her church there where she used to be amen over there in Kansas and I I'm talking about predominantly white so I'm I'm I'm not taking that as an excuse I ain't asking none of y'all to act can I be honest and real I'm not trying to act make you worship like a black man I want you to worship that's all worship the devil done put the the Dukes or something on most of the people because they feel like well I'm white and I'm not emotional that's a lie that's a devil's lie no maybe you don't know how to have the you don't maybe don't have the rhythm of Nehemiah but you don't have to have rhythm to worship you can be your own [Laughter] beat what I'm saying that's all I'm saying you know and and you know we we when I went to her church I thought I was going to be Stampede them people was running and jumping over benches and I'm telling you amen don't fall cuz they trap all over you I seen it with my own eyes I thought oh my God and I'm telling you that was the best Sunday school lesson I had ever been to they taught the word to those children it was powerful it it was powerful and and you felt such a love now what all was going on in there I don't know but there was something going on that that I don't know whether it's still there probably not but my point is I thought we were the ultimate and I went to this church thinking oh you know it' be predominant white and ain't going to be hardly nothing you you know my was out of for root Awakening so he said nobody can't tell me I done seen it with my own eyes I'm sorry the truth has made me free that's right the truth has made me free God allowed me to see that because he knew I was coming to this and let me tell y'all something what you what a lot of people don't know and I don't know why why I'm saying this but I have to say it I wish more people was here when I came to this message everybody was shouting and praising God years ago there was fire everywhere I went they had gifts and everything until some brother preached the Holy Ghost without sensation and since then it killed the church I've seen it happen now we're Beyond Pentecost and look what they doing now denying the very message Satan's trick because it is the anointing that destroy the yolks I'm almost done I keep saying that this is is just a one quote I'm trying to finish amen oh pretty religious right now he was more than a conqueror in the face of every difficult death uh death itself and forsaken of God he walked to the front like a conqueror died in such a way till even the people who stood by had to witness that he was the earth Shook and took a nervous prostration a chill run over the back of Shame for shame and his own Creator had to drop his blood on the earth to redeem it the moon and the stars refus to shine the Roman Centurion said truly that was the Son of God pilot said I washed my hands from him Judas the scari said I betrayed an innocent blood what was it everything had to recognize him he had been prophesied since the Garden of Eden the woman's seed and all the prophets everything grave notice it spoke forward to that time when the cre greatest conqueror when he would come and Conquer everything that Adam lost in the fall he would redeem it back to man oh there was no King monar potent take or nothing could take that place the mighty conqueror Christ Christ Jesus this is what just God this is what I'm going end on God just dropped this in my heart and you can take it as God or not God will not take a incomplete Church it didn't fall that way he will have to in order to defeat Satan he must have a man as complete as Adam was y'all hear what I'm saying that came from God just now so The Church Must Be a complete body he cannot otherwise he's defeating his whole purpose his whole purpose was not only to redeem but to restore mankind back to its original position and in not just being there it has to live it and in order for a Rapture to take place the bride must be a complete person or body in Christ made manifest am I I don't know how else to say it and you've been chosen what you going to do about it you've been chosen for the moment God has given his grace to us and right now we it's almost like how can I say it God has has come to a place and he's tightened things up if you ever been in the military have been around the military as as it growes harder it gets harder you start off light kind of well you don't think it's light at the time but when you realize that down the road it gets harder then you realize what you first had was light stuff but it don't get easy because they're training you they know that one day the country will rely upon your faith and courage so they they train you in such a way and they put you through tests that you think you could you can't do it I can remember you know pulling up on the bar not this way this way this way is easy this way is the hard and and you going up on your third or your fourth and you feel like you're going to die they say push it you can do it you can do it and then sometime they give you help to to hurdle that but there coming a time you got to do it all by yourself and that's how God is he's given you the Holy Ghost so at a appointed time you will be in complete Authority because he trust you is that the word let's stand I appreciate you I know uh you know we look and see uh by the grace of God I I I I said a few things out of my heart and and God knows it was in my heart so I couldn't keep it in there uh uh but people um it doesn't matter how small the number decreases too we've got a work to do you know and my point is if we can't do it let's just pray that for those who God will anoint everybody uh uh wasn't anointed to do everything but just pray that God will take those who are anointed and ordained to do the work to do it that's what we need that's what we need and I believe with all of my heart I'm not trying to be something great I'm nothing we all aren't anything without or besides Jesus Christ that's what makes us who we are but you know what brother I look for the day when you get a full Victory brother Robert I look at I look at my my sister and and all of us who Satan is Afflicted afflicting us and I can't stand it it troubles me I want you to know I care and I don't like Satan getting the victory or even the appearance of Victory you know you know what I'm saying as a pastor I look over here and I see things happening in the spirit even though I don't say anything I know what's going on I'm not stupid you know God has made me so amen that I've always had some kind of deser in my life so I see things I understand things my point is Satan is hiding somewhere and it needs to be exposed Victory amen our Victory amen is something is sucking this thing away from us and and somehow we need to know what it is we need to know God sent me here I believe in you I really believe in these people I believe in you it's all right to be overtaken and whatever it is but at the time we know what I'm saying is when I say all right we all are at times but we must repent we must give our lives ourselves to God help me Lord you know I I want to be right before God and my point is I trust that God will give us the grace so that nothing will be exposed but we will willingly be repented giving ourselves to God wherever it may be I just feel like there's something and I don't know exactly really where it's at and what it is but you know something is hindering and it's been for a while now we seem to go here then we go back down seem to go here then we go back down but God knows what it is and I'm I'm praying and I'm not going to tell you what I'm about to do but I'm praying and I'm seeking God and and I know God G to show you said what brother I don't know let me tell you something I was invited just recently to go to uh uh Nigeria well really last since last year forgot all about the the the invitation I had a dream about a month ago about this individual that was going to try to get into this thing and was going to bring havoc in the meetings in the whole process and don't you know that thing happened this individual was trying to push his way in I told the brother no I said this ain't the time for me to come I said besides that I don't I try my best not to go nowhere on Easter I want to be with my people when the resurrection happen CU I believe with all my heart is going to brother say some early Easter I really believe that that it'll happen in that season and you know my thing is this it was not a nice thing I saw in this dream now I know it's true what God showed me it's not for me to expose or to bring it to show people but my point is the one brother who invited me Tony jur basa who ministered here one time he called me and told me what was happening in the background and I said brother I didn't even want to mention this individual's name I said but I saw something there about a month ago in a dream and I said 'I can't go I said I can't tell you what to do with your meetings and what to do and the brother ended up canceling his meeting I said because I a dream it can be stopped if it's a vision it's a thus said the Lord you know what I'm saying so by the grace of God I I thank God for uh you know his grace I believe God hand is in all of our lives he loves us all and uh we appreciate you we just got to keep pressing people but what I'm saying if if you can't do nothing else I know all of us can pray prayer doesn't cost nothing and and let us pray for for each other is that all right I'm G tell you something and I I I don't I don't mean to flatter just and I can't cover all of y'all everybody has been a blessing to me but I really have a a a real love for Stampers you know just I saw how they came and you have been such a supportive people you know they just been there they come clean to church whenever they can you know you see them walking like I'm I you know you're like poring dolls to me when I see both of you together you know that's the way I look at you you know and I think oh my God you know it just you make me feel good when I see you and uh I I think about how they press and we got so many people in in in more strength than they and don't even come you know so brother you know I don't I don't worry about your salvation that's for sure I don't worry I just believe with all my heart you already sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is not a I don't believe it's a hope I know it's a no you know what I mean God didn't bring you here you know always tell my I said God didn't bring you here to lose you God brought you here to save you and I know they going through something right now but you know what I'mma tell you what I really believe it's just a Finishing Touch it's just a Finishing Touch and God is just getting all of us to a place where he's where they polishing you polishing you getting you the place where you can shine because I'm going tell you something when you are afflicted in your body and you don't understand why you got the pain and you can still love him anyway sister that's genuine that's a real real thing brother and and and and to think about how you know God could have took my brother he was there he was there he didn't why it's all for a purpose y'all understand what I'm saying these things don't come for n but I'm going tell you something by the grace of God these finishing touches that we can't fully understand we'll look back and say thank you Jesus we will thank you Jesus you know I I think about uh it's just the labors of everybody I don't want to go through the names because but I just thought I thought this is what we're thinking and and uh before I forget it and uh brother chapples brought this my attention and I hope y'all don't be mindful embarrassed by it but I was thinking about that he he brought to My ATT that parking spot right there by the door we want you guys to park there you're the elders so you won't have to you understand what I'm saying don't don't say no brother this is what we're going to do that that that place right there by the door is for brother con he so when they get here they don't have to look for no parking space they can come right here when they get get out they can WP bump bump and not in the in the car right we that's where it's going to be by the grace of God and if if the people won't won't do it I have to put a sign there amen we honoring you we're honoring you you know and uh we love you here we love y'all
