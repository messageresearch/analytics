[14:18] [Music]
[14:29] and I think I'm poor
[14:31] Amen if you've tried them a man okay man
[14:39] we had some issues with the recording
[14:42] this morning I sure enjoyed that message
[14:44] but it didn't make it to the internet so
[14:46] I was just for you well I sure did enjoy
[14:53] that message so I enjoy receiving as
[14:57] much as we enjoy giving it amen and I'll
[14:59] take every little bit of it amen amen
[15:03] now it's a traveling message the Lord
[15:06] ever gives me a chance
[15:08] Amen let's just open our Bibles to first
[15:12] Thessalonians chapter 4 will read the
[15:17] 13th through the 18th verse speak a
[15:24] message called being alive and remaining
[15:34] this scripture has been on my heart for
[15:38] Oh probably a month or so now but I
[15:47] heard it preached on my brother Tim
[15:51] Pruitt probably 10 15 years ago and just
[15:55] the way he preached China it's always
[15:56] stuck with me you know and and I just
[16:00] it's been on my mind now I kind of
[16:02] refreshed my memory recently and and
[16:04] just like I just got to preach on that
[16:06] amen amen because we want to be alive
[16:09] and we want to be remaining when he
[16:11] comes
[16:12] amen amen so first thessalonians chapter
[16:16] 4 verse 13 and it says I would not have
[16:23] you to be ignorant brethren considering
[16:27] them which are asleep that you sorrow
[16:30] not even as others which have
[16:33] no hope Amen so there is a hope that we
[16:36] have to have Amen and we have to have it
[16:40] as a possession amen
[16:42] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[16:46] rose again that speak service here even
[16:50] so them also which sleep in Jesus will
[16:53] God bring with him for this we say unto
[16:57] you by the word of the Lord that we
[17:00] which are alive and remain unto the
[17:03] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[17:06] them which are asleep
[17:08] for the Lord Himself showed the sin from
[17:11] heaven with a shout and with the voice
[17:14] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[17:17] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[17:19] first he repeats that phrase again he
[17:22] says then we which are alive and remain
[17:25] shall be caught up together with them in
[17:28] the clouds to meet the lord in the air
[17:31] and so we shall ever be with the Lord
[17:35] wherefore comfort one another with these
[17:38] words
[17:40] that's quite a promise hey man you know
[17:44] I let's just find a hit where as River
[17:49] amen Heavenly Father we just thank you
[17:52] Lord for this this word Lord promised
[17:55] father that or many people have received
[17:58] your promises over the years healing and
[18:02] deliverance lore but there are so few
[18:06] that have had a promise of meeting you
[18:10] in the air and lord I sometimes we
[18:14] forget that we have this promise waiting
[18:16] for us but nevertheless here it is on
[18:19] the pages of the Bible and I hear it
[18:21] still stands that there will be someone
[18:24] upon this earth who is going to be alive
[18:26] and they're gonna remain and that you
[18:29] are gonna meet us in the air llores we
[18:32] just want to walk around the scripture
[18:34] here for a few moments and talk it over
[18:36] Lord we just pray that you would come
[18:38] upon the scene father as we believe you
[18:41] chose the message Lord may you also
[18:43] bring the interpretation of it
[18:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:48] amen amen you can be seated something
[18:54] about having a promise like that that's
[18:58] it's different it's different than a lot
[19:01] of other promises that we've has it's
[19:04] more than just crossing a river and
[19:06] having it part before you it's more than
[19:10] the sick being healed it's more than the
[19:14] lost being saved but there's just
[19:15] something about how I'm going to promise
[19:17] that we who are alive and remain have a
[19:22] promise that we can look forward to
[19:24] meeting the Lord in the air it just it
[19:29] does something to me when I think about
[19:31] it that there are going to be people on
[19:33] this earth that are not gonna they're
[19:35] not going to pass down through death but
[19:38] like Enoch they'll be standing here and
[19:41] as it's been preached before the named
[19:43] Enoch knee is dedicated and disciplined
[19:45] amen and so they're going to people that
[19:47] are dedicated and disciplined on the
[19:49] earth they're gonna be waiting for the
[19:51] Lord and because they've waited up on
[19:54] the Lord he will show up and meet them
[19:56] in the air amen that will in a moment in
[19:59] a twinkling of an eye we are going to be
[20:01] changed and we're gonna get to meet the
[20:03] Lord in the air there is going to be a
[20:06] meeting in the air and the sweet sweet
[20:09] by-and-by I'm going to meet you greet
[20:11] you over there there's going to be a
[20:13] meeting in the air it's a promise that
[20:15] is just so astounding that somehow these
[20:19] bodies of ours is going to lose hold of
[20:22] natural gravitation and we're going to
[20:25] get to meet the Lord in the air
[20:27] amen as many people have looked for this
[20:29] great rapture that's great taking away
[20:31] amen and they've gone down to their
[20:33] graves waiting but there is going to be
[20:35] a people who who are actually going to -
[20:39] to experience this great promise amen
[20:43] and the pot in the Bible has a little
[20:45] description here of what those people
[20:47] are going to be like they're going to
[20:49] they're going to have this promise come
[20:51] over them amen
[20:53] they're going to be alive and they're
[20:55] going to remain now when it talks about
[20:59] being alive there's a lot of people that
[21:01] are alive on this earth that's not
[21:02] really what is talking about amen
[21:05] because there's many people on this
[21:06] earth that are alive
[21:08] amen but it's not talking about the
[21:10] natural kind of life that they're living
[21:12] amen they're their fruits testify about
[21:14] the life that they're living but no
[21:16] they're gonna be those that are not
[21:18] living by the natural life as within
[21:20] them but they're gonna be living
[21:22] according to the supernatural life of
[21:24] the Lord Jesus Christ that the life of
[21:27] Christ will be on the inside of them and
[21:29] they'll be living out as we said this
[21:31] morning they're giving free reign to the
[21:34] Holy Ghost amen
[21:36] they're gonna be free reign so that when
[21:38] they're so when the Holy Ghost is going
[21:40] on this trajectory and the and the cares
[21:43] of this life are going on this
[21:45] trajectory that this gives you to that
[21:49] amen and they yield their thoughts their
[21:52] ideas to the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[21:55] can move in their life unimpeded those
[21:58] people are alive with the fruits of the
[22:00] Holy Spirit amen amen so not only will
[22:04] this people that are going to experience
[22:06] this promise be alive like that with the
[22:09] life of the Lord Jesus Christ on display
[22:11] they're going to be remaining amen no
[22:14] that means that they're that they've
[22:16] gone through something amen they've gone
[22:18] through something that could have taken
[22:20] them out of the way but yet they stuck
[22:22] through it anyhow
[22:23] amen there there are many things that
[22:25] try to grab ahold of them that could
[22:27] have put them down on the ground but yet
[22:30] even though even through all that they
[22:32] remained they stood there and having
[22:35] done all they stand amen they stand
[22:38] there's many things that came in like a
[22:40] flood but through it all through the
[22:42] Word of God and with the testimony of
[22:43] Lord Jesus Christ
[22:45] they're remaining a man when Jesus and
[22:48] we probably get that answer where Jesus
[22:49] said when I return will I find faith on
[22:52] the earth there will be a people that
[22:54] can raise their hand and say yes yes
[22:57] Lord yes when you return you will find
[23:01] you will find faith on the earth why
[23:03] because that faith is in me amen faith
[23:06] that you gave out on the day of
[23:08] Pentecost is still here is still
[23:11] remaining
[23:12] it's down inside my soul amen and it
[23:14] will not go and it will not go away amen
[23:17] we are alive and we're remaining and
[23:20] we're trusting in the Lord we have a
[23:22] faith inside of ourselves that will not
[23:24] die a faith that is in ourselves that
[23:29] just will not die that no matter what
[23:32] happens in this life's journey we just
[23:35] believe we believe in a power of the
[23:40] Lord Jesus Christ that is greater than
[23:43] any power in this earth or under this
[23:47] earth or above this earth it is greater
[23:50] than all other power and and we have
[23:52] submit ourselves unto this Lord Jesus
[23:55] Christ we've heard about him in the word
[23:58] we prayed unto Him and then we got to
[24:01] experience him in a baptism of the Holy
[24:03] Ghost amen therefore we know we have the
[24:06] evidence inside of ourselves that he is
[24:09] still alive and he still remains God
[24:11] therefore we are still alive and we
[24:14] still remain the bride of Lord Jesus
[24:16] Christ amen as much as it's been
[24:20] prophesied that someone is going to be
[24:22] alive and remain that means there is a
[24:24] promise that we can grab ahold of - we
[24:28] can make it through amen we can make it
[24:31] we can go through this we can go through
[24:33] all the way to the end why because
[24:35] there's me somebody that's gonna be
[24:37] alive and it's gonna remain and that
[24:40] somebody is gonna be us amen it's got to
[24:43] be us amen so and why is it us why
[24:47] because we know more than others no is
[24:50] it because we're smarter there's no
[24:52] we're no smarter than bails we don't
[24:54] know any more than anybody else does but
[24:56] we have something that's been revealed
[24:58] to us and it's the word of Lord Jesus
[25:01] Christ and by holding on to his word
[25:03] we're gonna be alive and remain there's
[25:06] something about the word of the Lord
[25:08] that once you latch on to it and you
[25:12] grab ahold of it that no matter how what
[25:16] happens in the doldrums of life or
[25:18] whatever comes along the long life
[25:20] journey there's something about that
[25:22] word that you just hold on to it no
[25:24] matter how you
[25:25] how you feel in your mind no matter what
[25:28] your spirit goes through no matter how
[25:30] whatever might happen in your spirit or
[25:33] in your mind there's something about
[25:34] that word that once you've latched on to
[25:36] it you just can't let it go why is that
[25:39] it's because there's a prophecy out
[25:41] there that you have to fulfill that
[25:43] you're going to be alive and remain
[25:45] among after everything after everything
[25:48] happens that could happen to a person on
[25:50] this life's journey you're gonna be the
[25:52] one that's gonna be alive and remain at
[25:54] the coming of the Lord and therefore
[25:56] because of that you get to meet him in
[25:58] the air amen
[26:00] because there is going to be a meeting
[26:02] in the air amen someone's gonna
[26:04] experience that meeting it might as well
[26:06] be me and it might as well be you
[26:08] because who else is it gonna happen to
[26:11] amen but to those that the promise was
[26:14] given amen when a people receive a
[26:16] promise of the Lord they latch on to it
[26:19] and they love it
[26:20] they love everything about it and so
[26:23] they're there for when it comes to
[26:25] manifesting time God sees to it that
[26:27] they're there it's just like Ana I don't
[26:31] know how old she was and Simeon I don't
[26:33] know how old he was but there's
[26:35] something about it that even while
[26:37] everybody else does born the same year
[26:39] they're born kept dying and passing away
[26:41] they had a promise that they would get
[26:44] to see the Lord amen and in God no
[26:47] matter how old they got they said the
[26:49] Lord has told us that we're going to see
[26:51] the Lord's Messiah amen and therefore
[26:55] when the Lord's Messiah came the Messiah
[26:57] found them still alive and still
[26:59] remaining and not only that but still
[27:02] trusting in the word that was given to
[27:04] him amen and even so let it be unto us
[27:07] according to thy word amen we are gonna
[27:10] go on believing in remaining why because
[27:12] that's just who we are that's just what
[27:15] we do amen you know if I if I was to go
[27:19] find a if I want to find a dentist I'd
[27:22] go to a dentist office if I went in
[27:24] there I'd see a man he's working on
[27:25] teeth and he's doing a good job and
[27:28] patching things up I could say that man
[27:30] is a dentist why the evidence of what
[27:33] he's doing and where he is proves that
[27:36] he is a dentist you know if you want to
[27:38] find a mechanic
[27:39] go down to the car dealership you go
[27:41] down into the shop before a guy with
[27:43] some grease on his hands he look and
[27:44] watch and he has some skill about him
[27:46] and he's sitting there fixing the car
[27:48] and when he's done the car is back in a
[27:50] better condition and he found it and it
[27:52] works just right he say that man is a
[27:54] mechanic well there's also going to be
[27:56] believers upon this earth a man if you
[27:58] want to find them you come to a body of
[28:00] believers and you look at them and then
[28:02] what they do they believe a man and that
[28:05] is what they do it's their occupation
[28:07] there's some people are plumbers some
[28:08] people are mechanics but there is a body
[28:10] of people on this earth that are
[28:13] believers Amen Jesus himself say when
[28:16] the Son of Man returns will he find
[28:18] faith on the earth and we'd like to be
[28:20] those that raise our hands and answer
[28:23] him and say yes Lord when you return you
[28:26] will find faith on this earth because
[28:28] you'll find me on this earth and your
[28:30] faith has entered down into my heart so
[28:33] much it's anchored there that no matter
[28:36] what happens to me upon my life's
[28:37] journey no matter what happens to me my
[28:39] body or in my spirit or in my mind or
[28:42] whatever it goes I am gonna be the one
[28:44] that believes in the Lord amen then you
[28:46] are the material that is gonna be found
[28:48] waiting and live and remaining at the
[28:51] coming of the Lord amen I'm kind of glad
[28:55] about that amen
[28:57] let's turn over to let's turn over to
[29:04] Matthew chapter 17 verse 24
[29:10] I love this scripture here I love almond
[29:19] this little story means a lot to me just
[29:23] because it just it's just a little
[29:27] something that Jesus didn't have to do
[29:30] it this way but he did it just to help
[29:33] Peter out amen he did it just just to do
[29:38] something to help Peter out and what
[29:40] Jesus did here Peter could take and grab
[29:43] a hold of and hold it all the rest of
[29:46] the days of his life amen
[29:48] so Matthew chapter 17 verse 24 says and
[29:52] when they were come to Capernaum they
[29:55] that received tribute money came to
[29:57] Peter and said does not your master pay
[30:00] tribute he says yes and when he has come
[30:04] into the house Jesus prevented him
[30:06] saying what thinkest thou Simon you know
[30:10] I just almost have to wonder if maybe
[30:12] there was just something nagging on the
[30:14] back of Peters mind and he didn't fully
[30:16] understand something you know and and
[30:19] Jesus is gonna make sure he didn't want
[30:21] Peter to ever be waffling on anything so
[30:23] they wanted to make sure that the thing
[30:24] was settled in Peters mind amen and so
[30:27] he says what thinkest thou assignment of
[30:29] whom do the kings of the earth take
[30:32] customer tribute of their own children
[30:35] or of strangers and Peter saith unto Him
[30:38] of strangers and Jesus said to him then
[30:41] are the children free notwithstanding
[30:43] lest we should offend them go thou to
[30:47] the sea and cast a hook and take up the
[30:51] fish that first cometh up and when now
[30:54] has opened his mouth thou shalt find a
[30:56] piece of money and take and give unto
[30:58] them for me and me so here Jesus is
[31:01] saying you know by rights we don't even
[31:03] have to pay this tax by rights we
[31:06] shouldn't have to pay this but even
[31:10] though we don't have us I had the money
[31:11] to pay it I maybe we shouldn't have to
[31:13] pay it so we don't offend them I have a
[31:16] way that we can pay it amen he says and
[31:19] go down no I don't know when when Jesus
[31:22] Jesus couldn't just snap to speak
[31:23] and could have handed a coin to Peter
[31:26] amen but instead he told Peter to go on
[31:30] down to go do something like this
[31:32] something he normally would have done a
[31:33] lot of experience fishing a man and
[31:35] maybe he's opened a lot of fish's mouth
[31:37] he's never never seen a coin in one
[31:39] before of you know tens of thousands of
[31:42] fish that he caught in his life amen but
[31:44] now something new is gonna happen he
[31:47] goes down there and it's not just he
[31:49] found a fish with the coin in his mouth
[31:52] but it's the exact fish that the Lord
[31:55] Jesus told him about to me the moment
[32:00] this happened to Peter just increased
[32:05] his relationship to the Lord a little
[32:07] bit tighter amen a little bit closer
[32:10] that faith was anchored a little bit
[32:13] more sure because when you realize what
[32:16] God is capable of not just that he reins
[32:20] up on high but the fact that he is able
[32:22] to reach down into the affairs of men a
[32:24] man he's able to reach down into your
[32:26] life amen and do anything that he wants
[32:30] to do and to change any situation to be
[32:33] exactly how he wants to change it so
[32:36] Peter he goes out and he gopas up the
[32:38] fish's mouth and sure enough there's
[32:39] that coin you know to me from that
[32:42] moment on how could Peter ever doubt
[32:45] again the rest of his days anything to
[32:49] do with finances amen from this moment
[32:52] on Peter could never worry about money
[32:55] again in my book he would have no right
[32:57] to because he knows at any moment in
[33:00] time that if he ever had need of
[33:02] something that the same Lord Jesus who
[33:05] is still alive could just direct him to
[33:08] go pick up another fish amen no we are
[33:12] the people that are alive and remain
[33:13] like Peter was say meant and so we also
[33:17] had the same ability to pull the same to
[33:20] his story about history amen whatever we
[33:23] have need of in this life's journey we
[33:26] know that the Lord Jesus is able to take
[33:28] care of it
[33:28] amen we have the same faith that Peters
[33:30] why do we have that faith because God
[33:32] gave it to us it's just as simple
[33:35] God gave us a faith
[33:37] that there are many others on this world
[33:40] that try to have that faith they they
[33:43] wanted to have that faith I've seen
[33:45] people up on stages praying hoping that
[33:48] they had that faith I've seen people
[33:50] yelling at demons to come out just
[33:52] hoping and that maybe that demon would
[33:55] come out I've seen people wishing to
[33:57] their prayers to be answered but there's
[33:59] something about the bride of the Lord
[34:00] Jesus Christ that she's not wishing and
[34:03] hoping she knows her Lord amen she knows
[34:06] her Savior and she just believes him
[34:09] that's just that simple
[34:11] she just knows it's like it's like if
[34:14] I'm sitting in my living room at home
[34:16] and-and-and and the lights are on and
[34:19] they're a little bright and I'd like the
[34:21] lights to be turned off but I don't
[34:23] necessarily want to get up on the couch
[34:24] off the couch I can look over at my wife
[34:27] as she's walking by and say honey you
[34:29] know could you shut the lights off for
[34:31] me and you know what there's no there's
[34:34] no doubt in my mind but that she would
[34:39] just walk right over there and shut the
[34:41] lights off she wouldn't think about it
[34:44] she wouldn't pause about it she wouldn't
[34:45] say with exasperation she'd just go over
[34:48] there and flip the switch off now how
[34:50] much work did the Lord Jesus put in to
[34:53] get in that coin and that fish's mouth
[34:57] no more than what my wife would do to go
[34:59] turn on a light switch and this is our
[35:01] husband the Lord Jesus Christ amen when
[35:05] you realized that there is nothing
[35:06] impossible to God he doesn't have to
[35:09] work at it he doesn't have to try at it
[35:10] he just has to speak his word and it
[35:13] comes into a action it comes into beat
[35:16] and when you begin to have faith like
[35:18] that and you have a confidence in your
[35:20] relationship with the Lord and you just
[35:22] know the eight we are one of a kind amen
[35:26] flesh was blown flesh of his flesh bone
[35:28] of his bone amen it's our husband we are
[35:31] the bride of Lord Jesus Christ
[35:33] we didn't make ourselves too bright it's
[35:35] just who we are we when we received them
[35:38] when we received that revelation we went
[35:41] and we grabbed ahold of every single
[35:44] promise that we could find in the Bible
[35:46] and we believed on until it came to pass
[35:48] that's how we receive the baptism of the
[35:50] Holy
[35:51] amen we believe the word and they came
[35:53] to pass in our lives and we received
[35:56] Christ on the inside the same Lord Jesus
[35:59] still alive still remaining in us and
[36:02] therefore we also get to be alive in
[36:04] Romania when he comes amen so that story
[36:08] vism just for Peters for all of us
[36:11] amen every single one of us if you have
[36:14] a need upon life's journey amen
[36:17] hey so I brought that quote up with me
[36:20] brother brands this one to read that
[36:23] real quick says
[36:36] well it just disappeared on me so we'll
[36:39] just continue on without amen amen let's
[36:47] turn over to ice turn over to Genesis
[36:54] chapter 22 real quick
[37:04] there are people throughout all the
[37:06] scripture that they got to a point in
[37:09] their lives to where they had seen God
[37:11] do so much but they just believed in God
[37:15] for everything amen
[37:18] that's quite a place to be amen they've
[37:21] just got to a place in their lives where
[37:23] they just seen God do enough that they
[37:26] knew Liew is just capable of doing
[37:28] anything that's a good place to be once
[37:32] you get to that place let me tell you
[37:34] Saints I hate to say you've arrived but
[37:37] you're you're pretty much there I mean
[37:39] you when you begin to realize that God
[37:42] has your back that when God is actually
[37:46] interested in affairs of your life that
[37:48] God really does love you he really does
[37:51] care for you he really does have his eye
[37:54] upon you and you just believe you just
[37:57] know it's not a hope so you don't have
[38:00] to wish it so you don't have to hope he
[38:02] hears your prayer you just know that he
[38:04] hears your prayer it's just a faith that
[38:06] rises up within you and that you
[38:09] actually have ownership of that faith
[38:11] Amen as maybe walk there they'll reach
[38:13] and grab out and grasp try grasp at that
[38:16] faith but there's other people that they
[38:18] just own it they just own that faith
[38:20] it's there so it's a possession thank
[38:23] you they received it from Christ himself
[38:25] as down anchored inside their soul and
[38:27] they just believe that they're believers
[38:29] that's just what they are as much as a
[38:31] mechanic as a mechanic a plumber as a
[38:33] plumber
[38:34] these are believers and they do believe
[38:36] amen amen
[38:39] Genesis 22 chapter 22 verse 5 and
[38:44] Abraham said unto the young man abide ye
[38:47] here with the ass and I and the Lord
[38:49] will go yonder and worship and come
[38:51] again unto you what's he doing there
[38:53] he's believing amen he's just believing
[38:57] and Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[38:59] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[39:02] and took the knife in his hand and the
[39:04] fire in his hand and the knife and they
[39:06] went both of them together and Isaac
[39:09] spake unto Abraham his father and said
[39:10] My father he said here am I my son and
[39:13] he said Behold the fire and the wood but
[39:17] where is
[39:18] the lamb for a burnt offering and
[39:20] Abraham said my son God will provide
[39:25] himself a lamb for a burnt offering and
[39:28] so they went both of them together
[39:31] there's something that was within his
[39:34] soul that he just knew that God would
[39:38] provide and now we have Jehovah Jireh
[39:41] ever since then Amen everybody that's
[39:45] ever trusted in Jehovah Jireh was
[39:47] looking back to this scripture amen they
[39:50] our God will provide well our God will
[39:53] provide a lamb
[39:54] amen my gut my son God will provide
[39:56] himself a lamb for the burnt offering
[39:59] so they went both together amen and what
[40:02] happened the same here he goes up to
[40:04] kill his son and the same son he say
[40:06] will return again with us came back down
[40:09] why because God provided a lamb stay
[40:12] bruh ham knew he wasn't guessing you
[40:15] know sometimes and you know if they were
[40:17] trying to make a movie of it if
[40:19] Hollywood was to get ahold of this
[40:20] they'd have him doubting and everything
[40:22] else you know hey can you imagine what
[40:24] Holly would do if they tried to recreate
[40:26] this movie they'd have him doubting and
[40:29] everything else but you know he wasn't
[40:31] going up there and oh he wasn't Abraham
[40:35] knew exactly what was gonna happen we
[40:37] went out there we say are you sure about
[40:42] that brother Troy yes Abraham knew
[40:44] exactly what was what why why was
[40:48] Abraham able to say God will provide for
[40:50] himself a sacrifice he knew that God was
[40:54] gonna provide he knew that there was
[40:56] promises regarding that son Isaac and he
[40:59] knew that those promises could not fail
[41:01] and that no matter what happened to
[41:04] Isaac he didn't know exactly maybe how
[41:06] it was gonna go down exactly what was
[41:08] going to happen but he knew one thing
[41:09] that God's promises from way back we're
[41:13] going to come to pass and he even saw it
[41:15] as the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[41:17] know that those promises from way back
[41:19] are gonna happen you say why do you
[41:22] believe you know why do you believe the
[41:25] promise the promises of Lord Jesus
[41:27] Christ why do you believe in a rapture
[41:29] every generation has died and God
[41:32] the sand here you're thinking that
[41:33] you're gonna get out of here without
[41:34] dying why do you believe that because of
[41:37] a promise because of a promise
[41:41] who is that promise given to was given
[41:44] to me amen
[41:46] so I could be alive and remain at the
[41:48] coming of the Lord amen why did God give
[41:54] that promises and he gave it for me
[41:56] that's just what it is I'm taking that
[41:59] and applying to myself well how can you
[42:02] do that how can you do that how do you
[42:03] know it's not the generation after you
[42:05] he just gave it to me he just gave it to
[42:08] me it's mine I claim it I claimed in his
[42:11] mind as a possession amen amen amen now
[42:22] I'm gonna read that quote amen it says
[42:37] well the round says that little tree is
[42:40] set out a little slip of it set out and
[42:43] you have to water it and it has to drink
[42:46] it has to drink more than its portion
[42:48] and just drinks and the more drinks and
[42:51] drinks till it pushes out limbs and then
[42:54] it pushes out leaves and it pushes out
[42:56] buds then it pushes out apples
[42:58] it just keeps drinking and pushing and
[43:00] that's the way we are we are planted in
[43:04] Christ Jesus the inexhaustible fountain
[43:06] of life in exhaustible fountain of life
[43:10] that means we can just sit there and
[43:12] drink and drink and drink and drink amen
[43:17] we can read this Bible and accept it and
[43:19] accept it and believe it and believe it
[43:21] and it will just keep producing fruit in
[43:23] our lives that's just the way it's going
[43:25] to be amen amen we just drink and push
[43:29] and drink and everything that we have
[43:32] need when we're filled with the Holy
[43:34] Spirit every healing everything that we
[43:37] have need of in life's journey is given
[43:39] unto us right then right then when
[43:43] you're a young baby and Jesus Christ
[43:45] when you're a young just a young
[43:48] Christian when you were first received
[43:49] the Holy Ghost right then and there
[43:51] everything you have need of and this
[43:54] life's journey is given to you right
[43:56] then even the rapture Amen it's given to
[44:00] you it's yours everything I meet up is
[44:02] given to you right there
[44:03] Amen it's your personal property you own
[44:07] it amen
[44:09] and it's just the way it is other people
[44:12] they might worry about it they grasp it
[44:14] faith is always something external to
[44:16] some and something that they they wish
[44:19] this would happen but there's other
[44:20] people to have such a confidence in the
[44:22] Lord Jesus Christ that they know all the
[44:24] guy to do is bow their heads and start
[44:26] praying and all heaven starts listening
[44:29] and there's not a doubt in them about
[44:33] where their prayer goes because they
[44:36] know exactly where their prayer is going
[44:37] and they know exactly who is listening
[44:39] to it and they know exactly what his
[44:41] capabilities are that's just the bride
[44:44] and Lord Jesus Christ amen and that's
[44:46] the condition that we are to be when the
[44:48] rapture
[44:49] we're supposed to be alive and remaining
[44:53] with the same faith until the coming of
[44:56] the Lord amen so when the so when the
[44:59] rapture does come amen just five minutes
[45:02] for the rapture what condition are we
[45:04] gonna be in we're gonna be alive
[45:07] with life of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[45:10] we're gonna remaining still believing
[45:12] after everything that we've gone to
[45:14] still trusting and knowing that the
[45:16] promises of God are true but the
[45:18] promises of God are yes and amen amen
[45:21] amen
[45:24] everything that we have need of and
[45:26] life's journey is given to us right then
[45:29] it's all your personal property just
[45:32] drink that's all look and live that's
[45:36] all then you can easily see the
[45:39] resurrection can't you
[45:41] what's the resurrection he talking about
[45:43] he's talking about changing back to a
[45:45] young man that's the resurrection he's
[45:49] talking with he's talking about changing
[45:51] back to a young man again how say how do
[45:53] I do that I just keep drinking and keep
[45:55] pushing and that life that is welling up
[45:58] on the inside of me all son begins to
[46:01] manifest itself and the gray hair turns
[46:04] what amen the the wrinkles turn smooth
[46:06] amen gain weight over the years it goes
[46:10] back amen everything is just goes right
[46:13] back to where it was why because that is
[46:15] what God had in his mind in the
[46:17] beginning a man God had his mind in the
[46:20] beginning all those attributes right
[46:21] there and so we drink and we push we
[46:24] keep pushing out those fruits but there
[46:26] is another manifestation to where it
[46:27] comes and finally changes this mortal
[46:30] body and one day in a moment in a
[46:32] twinkling of an eye after all that
[46:34] drinking and all that pushing we're
[46:36] gonna be changed why because we are
[46:38] those that are alive and remain at the
[46:40] coming of the Lord and when the Lord
[46:42] comes he comes for he comes the window
[46:46] son of man returns where will he lay his
[46:48] head amen upon the bride of Lord Jesus
[46:51] Christ he is the capstone they are the
[46:54] pyramid amen that's just the way it's
[46:57] going to be
[47:00] man accepting the word keeps me alive
[47:04] just constantly accepting the word keeps
[47:08] me alive
[47:09] every time I accept it every time I find
[47:11] something I accept it I say yes Lord ask
[47:13] truth Lord Amen Lord I received that in
[47:16] my life Lord and that's what keeps me
[47:18] alive
[47:19] amen it's just like if you had an engine
[47:21] if you drain it with all of its oil
[47:23] although I loved it it wasn't even
[47:25] starts getting hot it starts overheating
[47:27] and things start burning up on the
[47:30] inside but if you take an engine and you
[47:32] just keep it oil and they're fresh I can
[47:34] just run mile after mile ten thousand
[47:37] miles later fifty thousand miles later
[47:39] two hundred thousand miles later three
[47:41] hundred thousand miles later that engine
[47:43] just keeps being refreshed to every oil
[47:46] change refreshed and refreshed and
[47:48] refreshed and it just keeps running in
[47:50] the same condition and then after three
[47:53] hundred thousand miles it still has
[47:54] pretty much the same amount of metal it
[47:56] had the beginning why because there's
[47:58] always that smoothness of the oil within
[48:00] it
[48:01] amen same thing with the Christian they
[48:03] keep drinking they keep pushing they
[48:05] don't get frustrated they don't get
[48:07] worried why because they believe in the
[48:09] Lord Jesus Christ it's when you start
[48:11] doubting that you start overheating why
[48:15] is that because you're losing the oil of
[48:17] the Holy Spirit and when you get mad and
[48:20] frustrated you start overheating why
[48:22] because you're losing the oil of the
[48:24] Holy Spirit amen you have to get back to
[48:26] that refreshing Amen at a time of
[48:29] renewal why so that that anger doesn't
[48:31] come back and you only by staying in his
[48:33] presence do you keep staying in that
[48:36] same condition and that condition is
[48:38] being alive and remaining being alive
[48:42] and remaining through it all you were
[48:44] alive and you remained in the same
[48:46] condition so it's the same condition you
[48:49] were back at the dealership 300,000
[48:53] miles later you're in the same condition
[48:55] why because you have had there you've
[48:57] had the experience of the refreshing of
[48:59] the Holy Ghost
[49:01] over and over and over and oil change
[49:03] after oil change refilling after
[49:06] refilling refilling after refilling why
[49:08] because you're gonna be one of those
[49:10] that are alive and remain
[49:12] at the coming of the Lord amen how did
[49:16] you make it through brother I just
[49:18] trusted in the Lord I just trust in the
[49:20] Lord constantly faithfully every problem
[49:23] that's the medicine I took for every
[49:25] problem I'm just trusting in the Lord
[49:27] just believing in his word amen I know
[49:30] he'll see me through
[49:31] I took the problem I laid it upon the
[49:33] altar where the blood of the Lamb is
[49:35] amen
[49:35] I've checked my life over I've done
[49:38] everything I know how to do so now I'm
[49:39] just waiting upon the Lord hey man let's
[49:44] turn over to first Kings 17 there's a
[49:47] familiar story but we'll read through it
[49:49] again we won't be much longer
[50:09] I'm sorry second Kings three
[50:24] second Kings three verse 16
[50:34] Sartre the 14th verse and Elijah said as
[50:39] the Lord of Hosts liveth before whom I
[50:42] stand surely were not by regard the
[50:45] presence of Jehoshaphat the king of
[50:47] Judah I would not look toward the Norse
[50:49] easy but now bring me a minstrel and it
[50:54] came to pass so in the minstrel played
[50:56] that the hand of the Lord came upon him
[50:58] amen this is a familiar story we
[51:00] remember the evil king and asked Elijah
[51:04] to come and give him a blessing tell him
[51:07] how to win the battle but that the evil
[51:10] King didn't deserve to win a battle at
[51:12] that time but because there was a
[51:14] righteous King there on the battlefield
[51:16] Jehoshaphat amen Elijah came and said I
[51:19] will just because of why Josh defense
[51:21] presents a man so so he had a minstrel
[51:25] calm play and the presence of Lauren
[51:28] came down and the answer the Lord said
[51:30] thus saith Lord make this valley full of
[51:33] ditches for thus saith Lord ye shall
[51:35] meet you should not see win neither show
[51:38] you see rain yet the valley shall be
[51:40] filled with water that you may drink
[51:42] both ye in your cattle in your beasts
[51:43] and this is but a light thing in the
[51:46] sight of the Lord he will deliver the
[51:48] Moabites also into your hand amen so
[51:51] there they were there stuck out in the
[51:52] desert there trying to win a battle and
[51:55] they couldn't win it and then they
[51:56] started running our water and now even
[51:58] the Eagle Creek King is crying out to
[52:01] Jehovah for help amen and that's how it
[52:04] is when times get rough he's just
[52:06] reading the other day an article about
[52:07] they say down Venezuela Venezuela has
[52:10] been a godless country for a long time
[52:12] amen but now all of a sudden they're
[52:15] having a resurgence of faith amen the
[52:17] churches are being filled why because
[52:20] they're running out of food they're
[52:22] running out of clean water they don't
[52:24] know when their electricity is going to
[52:25] come back on there our government is in
[52:27] shambles he used to be the richest
[52:29] country in South America and now they're
[52:31] the poorest country in South America and
[52:33] what's going on now all of a sudden
[52:34] because they're in trouble
[52:36] they're returning back to the Lord and
[52:38] right now if all the powers to come back
[52:40] on and food in every home where were the
[52:43] churches be next Sunday you know that's
[52:46] just the nature of people
[52:47] a man by the but Elijah said okay so you
[52:51] need water and you need the Moabites to
[52:53] be killed and so he told me start
[52:55] digging ditches the waters gonna come
[52:56] you gotta get ready for it you know and
[52:59] and even though the the king is there
[53:02] they did exactly what the Prophet said
[53:04] the Bride of Christ knows that whatever
[53:09] the word of Lord says she just gets
[53:10] ready and it happens
[53:12] amen it did not surprise Elisha amen it
[53:19] may have surprised everybody else in
[53:21] that entire scenario but Elisha was one
[53:24] man that was not surprised that what
[53:25] happened that all of a sudden you know
[53:27] next morning a rush you know water came
[53:30] through and filled all our ditches with
[53:31] water and then what the Lord came is
[53:33] through their enemy so as I saw with the
[53:36] Bride of Christ she's not surprised at
[53:39] what the Lord does the Bride of Christ
[53:42] is not surprised when God answers her
[53:44] prayer why because she believes she when
[53:48] she prays she is expecting that God will
[53:52] hear her prayer why does she do that
[53:54] because she's alive and she's remaining
[53:57] what's your main and perfect faith she's
[54:02] remaining in the same condition that she
[54:04] was back at the beginning amen back when
[54:07] God first thought of her back when
[54:09] however the condition that's that God
[54:12] imagined his bride to be in that same
[54:15] condition that he prophesied them to
[54:17] being we've accepted that prophecy is
[54:19] ours it's a possession
[54:22] it belonged to us when we received the
[54:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're
[54:26] still holding on to it amen and so now
[54:29] no matter what happens to us upon this
[54:31] life's journey we just keep drinking and
[54:34] pushing amen and we know they are God
[54:36] will answer our prayers and it doesn't
[54:39] surprise us when it happens Amen what we
[54:42] knew God would do that
[54:43] we knew that God is capable of doing
[54:46] that it doesn't it doesn't surprise us
[54:47] from God answers prayers
[54:50] amen amen let's just last scripture here
[54:54] Psalms 23
[55:05] brother Isaiah was gonna minister
[55:07] tonight but yeah got held up in Iowa
[55:09] City there and had to stay over so he
[55:12] asked me to minister this evening for
[55:15] them amen Psalms 23 verse 4 it says yea

[55:25] shadow of death I will fear no evil for

[56:55] the way that it is for the bride of Lord
[56:57] Jesus Christ as Paul said in sickness
[56:59] and death and suffering and in calm and
[57:03] no matter what it is wherever I am you
