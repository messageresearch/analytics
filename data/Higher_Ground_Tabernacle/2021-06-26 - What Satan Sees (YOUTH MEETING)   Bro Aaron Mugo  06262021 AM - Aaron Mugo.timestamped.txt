[38:50] and people are not dignified you don't
[38:52] mind worshiping god
[38:54] they don't mind sweating and they don't
[38:56] mind jumping and shouting and screaming
[38:58] and
[38:59] [Music]
[39:11] [Music]
[39:12] himself and my first time meeting him
[39:16] but the brothers have referred him and i
[39:18] i trust their word
[39:21] we're just believing that our brother's
[39:22] going to bless us
[39:24] you know i got a witness from the lord

[39:56] especially elderly people
[39:58] they know that something's real because
[40:01] we're living in such a wicked
[40:03] age and so when you see people young
[40:05] people especially
[40:06] talking about jesus it gets everybody's
[40:10] attention
[40:11] and i'm not going to preach because i'm

[42:16] verse 12.
[42:17] and while you're turning to that uh i
[42:19] just want to say i thank you the
[42:21] church for inviting me here i recognize
[42:24] the spirit on brother isaiah is a
[42:26] wonderful one to invite a young minister
[42:27] who's not
[42:29] been tried probably as effectively as
[42:32] the older generation but
[42:34] um still has a burning heart who wants
[42:36] to surrender to the lord
[42:39] i'm very well i feel very welcome here
[42:42] like
[42:43] everything from going to the office
[42:44] coming over here hearing the music and
[42:46] the singing i appreciate it brother
[42:47] caleb
[42:48] i i appreciate these brothers here who
[42:50] travel with me it's a
[42:52] about a nine hour drive coming from
[42:54] kentucky
[42:56] and if you don't know me i'm brother
[42:58] aaron my last name is mugo
[43:00] and uh i live in kentucky but i go to
[43:02] church in indiana just across the river
[43:04] and um yeah i love the lord and that's
[43:07] the important thing
[43:08] amen and i recognize that if you would
[43:11] if you're a young person and you come
[43:13] out here on a saturday
[43:15] and take time off to come over here you
[43:17] must love the lord too
[43:18] and i feel very honored to be um
[43:21] counted worthy to speak to you guys i i
[43:24] realized that you're god's children
[43:26] and i could say something that will be
[43:27] wrong i pray that that just gets thrown
[43:29] in the trash and you just take
[43:31] even if it's just a little bit that's
[43:32] right out of this service just take it
[43:34] out
[43:35] um i just want to follow the will of the
[43:37] lord here you know um
[43:40] okay so here in isaiah chapter 14
[43:43] let's go to 12. this is actually talking
[43:47] about
[43:48] lucifer and there's two chapters
[43:50] specifically
[43:51] in the bible that referred to him
[43:53] directly as if it's talking to him
[43:55] and one of them is in ezekiel chapter 28
[43:58] the other one is in isaiah here in 14.
[44:01] so he says how art thou fallen from
[44:04] heaven o lucifer son of the morning
[44:06] how are thou cut down to the ground
[44:08] which did speak in the nations
[44:10] for thou hast said in thine heart i will
[44:13] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[44:15] throne above the stars of god
[44:17] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[44:19] congregation in the sides of the north
[44:21] i will ascend above the heights of the
[44:23] clouds i will be like the most high
[44:26] that's up to 14 so you may be seated
[44:29] that's the main text i wanted to read
[44:31] today
[44:34] just to start with and i wanted to talk
[44:35] on the topic um
[44:37] what god sees i mean sorry what satan
[44:39] sees
[44:40] um because you got to realize that
[44:45] brother branham tells us that we're in
[44:46] the greatest battle ever fought and
[44:48] for there to be a battle there is an
[44:50] adversary and then there is our side
[44:52] which you want to be on god's side so
[44:54] there's god's side then there's satan's
[44:55] side
[44:56] and satan's side is always expressed by
[44:59] doubt
[45:00] in what god has what god says so god's
[45:03] word
[45:03] although it created the world and
[45:05] although we we live in it and we study
[45:07] it and everything
[45:08] like we focus on it as christians
[45:10] although that is presented to us
[45:12] if you do anything outside of it or if
[45:15] you doubt it or if you don't take it as
[45:16] it is the way god wants
[45:18] it to be then um then you're on satan's
[45:22] side
[45:22] and you're doubting that's doubt so uh
[45:26] if you does anybody have a schofield
[45:27] bible anybody reading one of those
[45:29] you got one uh okay well i guess i'm in
[45:32] the minority
[45:33] so if you go to your scofield bible
[45:36] actually and read the same exact
[45:37] scripture
[45:39] in isaiah 14. uh let me just turn to it
[45:42] real quick
[45:44] we have this should be on page 726
[45:49] because i remember it now brother
[45:51] branham used a scofield bible and i
[45:53] bought one from
[45:54] the voice of god in order to you know
[45:57] just
[45:57] be like the prophet you know i don't
[45:58] really know what i was thinking whenever
[45:59] i did that i just did it
[46:01] but then when i i mean i know he doesn't
[46:03] agree with everything that schofield
[46:05] says but he says a profound statement
[46:07] at the bottom of the page in reference
[46:09] to this chapter talking to satan which
[46:11] we just read
[46:12] we didn't read the whole chapter just
[46:13] those few verses right there but
[46:15] he has a statement down there and it
[46:17] says when lucifer said
[46:19] i will sin began he said
[46:23] when lucifer said i will sin began
[46:26] and you can tie it right back to the
[46:27] message because brother branham says
[46:29] that we are a triune being just like god
[46:33] and we're in three parts it's our body
[46:35] soul and spirit so you have
[46:37] your physical senses you know see taste
[46:38] your smell uh
[46:40] feel and then you have the spiritual
[46:43] senses you have
[46:44] memory reasoning all those ones over
[46:45] there i don't remember all of them right
[46:47] now
[46:47] but you have all of these senses but
[46:50] then whenever you get down to your soul
[46:53] what happens your soul is whatever
[46:54] accepts the word or denies the word
[46:57] so uh in reference to that
[47:00] you have either faith or doubt and
[47:02] that's down in your soul
[47:04] it's not five senses it's just either
[47:05] faith or doubt
[47:07] so whenever the word is presented to you
[47:09] you either take god's instructions or
[47:11] you take god's way
[47:12] and that's god's will and if you're
[47:14] outside of that that automatically makes
[47:16] you in satan's will
[47:18] amen all right and nobody wants to be in
[47:20] there right i mean raise your hands if
[47:21] you want to be in things well
[47:23] right no okay no no hands that's what i
[47:26] thought
[47:26] nobody wants that um so whenever he said
[47:31] now the reason that schofield says way
[47:33] back in heaven sin began
[47:34] keep in mind this is before the fall of
[47:36] satan this is before he led all those
[47:38] angels out there
[47:39] to go against in in a fight against
[47:42] michael and all that history before the
[47:43] world actually begins
[47:45] before he falls down to earth so way
[47:47] back then
[47:49] satan was already sinning in his heart
[47:51] he was already sinning right there
[47:53] because he said i will it's like my will
[47:57] so you gotta you gotta think of it this
[47:58] way an angelic being
[48:00] is actually they're different from us
[48:03] because they are godly
[48:06] they were godly from the day they were
[48:08] conceived right
[48:09] they are trying to achieve that perfect
[48:11] word perfect will of god
[48:13] they aren't doing that because we are we
[48:16] had to because we fell
[48:17] and god created us to be like this this
[48:20] was his will
[48:21] um not his perfect will but his
[48:24] permissible this is exactly how he
[48:26] planned for things to go
[48:27] so back whenever angels were all angels
[48:31] and they were all in the will of god
[48:33] they were all living the will of god
[48:35] keep in mind lucifer was sinning in his
[48:38] heart
[48:39] and it started in his heart he hadn't
[48:40] actually manifested those sins in the
[48:42] outside by actually acting on them
[48:44] he hadn't started a rebellion he hadn't
[48:46] done any of that stuff
[48:47] but he was already sinning way down in
[48:49] his heart way down in his soul
[48:52] and i just wanted to show you that we
[48:54] often do the same thing ourselves
[48:56] if you think about it now you can
[49:00] actually
[49:00] i'm trying to keep in mind the title is
[49:02] what satan sees so you're trying to look
[49:04] at this from satan's perspective
[49:06] and you don't want to like keep a godly
[49:08] perspective on things this is just the
[49:10] way he's thinking
[49:11] so you can actually see it if you go to
[49:13] matthew chapter four
[49:14] um let's see chapter 4 verse 1
[49:18] through 11 you actually don't actually
[49:19] have to turn to that but i had that
[49:21] written down
[49:24] this is right after jesus is baptized by
[49:26] john the baptist
[49:27] he goes out into the wilderness and then
[49:29] he fast for 40 days so after 40 days
[49:31] everybody knows he was he was tempted
[49:33] three times
[49:34] so if you if you want to get an idea of
[49:36] what satan's thinking
[49:37] and what he views the world as you can
[49:40] actually look at it at his interactions
[49:42] with god
[49:42] throughout the bible you can see it so
[49:45] when he's talking face to face with
[49:46] jesus the first thing he says
[49:48] is why don't you turn this
[49:52] stone into bread right that was the very
[49:54] first temptation
[49:55] now if you look at that that's just the
[49:59] way he's thinking so the way he's
[50:00] thinking is
[50:01] i i i want something and i'm going to
[50:04] use god's word
[50:05] to get it that's not the way you should
[50:08] be thinking
[50:08] because that's the devil's way of
[50:10] thought now he's like i have this power
[50:12] god promised it in the word i if i have
[50:15] faith then i can apply it to the stone
[50:16] and it's going to become bread
[50:18] so he's just offering to jesus what he
[50:20] thinks
[50:21] is the ultimate offering like what he
[50:24] thinks like
[50:25] there is nothing wrong with it because
[50:27] he has the word to back it up
[50:29] and he's presenting it to him so from
[50:31] the devil's point of view
[50:32] that's the correct application of the
[50:34] word to serve yourself
[50:36] and you can see that a lot in the world
[50:38] in the christian world nowadays some
[50:40] people go out there
[50:41] and they might be ministers they might
[50:43] be something else
[50:44] but they'll use the word to fight their
[50:46] battles and start arguing
[50:47] back and forth with each other and
[50:49] they're like hey this book says this
[50:50] this quote says this i'm gonna throw it
[50:52] in your face and all that stuff that's
[50:54] not what you want to use it for you want
[50:55] the word to use you you want god to use
[50:57] you
[50:58] you want him to work through you and
[51:00] handle his word correctly
[51:02] that's why jesus had his responses were
[51:04] always it is also written it is also
[51:05] written
[51:06] when you look through all of these
[51:07] temptations that's super important
[51:09] that you take the entire word you don't
[51:11] just take that little portion that
[51:12] serves your own interests
[51:14] very important all right so to jesus
[51:17] that would be self-serving if he
[51:18] actually
[51:19] listened to what the devil said it would
[51:21] be
[51:22] okay i'm trying to help my body in my
[51:24] flesh my physical body
[51:25] i'm just gonna turn this into bread then
[51:26] i'm gonna eat so it helps me
[51:28] but you gotta gotta remember that that
[51:31] wouldn't be in god's will
[51:32] see god's will had him out there fasting
[51:35] so he would be breaking his fast of his
[51:37] own accord
[51:38] if you think about it and read on
[51:40] through the chapter you realize that the
[51:42] angels come down and minister
[51:43] to him after he fasts because god's will
[51:45] was hey
[51:46] i'm going to make sure to minister him
[51:49] to him at the appropriate time when he
[51:50] needs the strength to go on with his
[51:52] ministry
[51:52] but if he broke it off early there that
[51:54] would be his own will
[51:56] and that wouldn't be god's will okay so
[51:58] the second
[51:59] the second temptation let's look at that
[52:00] one too um he takes them up to a high
[52:03] place i always imagined him on top of a
[52:04] skyscraper even though i don't really
[52:06] know what
[52:06] where he was he was just on top of a
[52:08] really tall building or
[52:09] high up place might have been a mountain
[52:11] i don't really know but
[52:13] satan tells him hey if you if you step
[52:16] off of here
[52:17] and you follow the way down god's gonna
[52:20] make sure you're not gonna dash one foot
[52:22] against the ground
[52:23] and he had the scripture to prove it he
[52:26] referred to the old testament he's like
[52:27] hey
[52:28] this that's what it says and then jesus
[52:30] responds with thou shalt not tempt the
[52:32] lord thy god
[52:33] so how would that be self-serving in
[52:35] jesus's case
[52:37] because i've often been in situations
[52:40] like
[52:40] you know you're probably in a dangerous
[52:44] situation and you're like god's gonna
[52:45] help me you know you just walk on
[52:47] but that doesn't mean that you can just
[52:50] walk down any street during
[52:51] any time of day and expect to be safe
[52:53] because you're technically tempting him
[52:55] if you know better
[52:56] and you're putting yourself in that
[52:58] situation that's tempting god
[53:00] in a way you know and that would be
[53:02] self-serving because you're just like
[53:04] throwing everything caution to the wind
[53:05] so that's
[53:06] that's the phrase you throw caution to
[53:07] the winds and you just walk where you
[53:09] shouldn't
[53:09] go or you do something you shouldn't do
[53:11] because you know god's gonna take care
[53:13] of it
[53:14] he might not take care of it in order to
[53:16] teach you something you don't know the
[53:17] mind of god no one can know the mind of
[53:18] god it's written in the scripture
[53:20] who can know the mind of god so
[53:23] if jesus had actually taken him up on
[53:25] that he would just be satisfying his own
[53:27] curiosity
[53:28] and that is pointless it's not going to
[53:30] help anybody but jesus
[53:31] and it's just probably going to prove to
[53:33] the people around him that god is with
[53:34] me ooh look at me
[53:35] you know but that wasn't god's will that
[53:37] he steps off of the high place and falls
[53:39] down
[53:40] that wasn't his will in the first place
[53:42] third temptation same exact thing
[53:44] same exact train of thought see you got
[53:46] to think of it from the devil's
[53:47] perspective
[53:49] there is no way out of the tests that
[53:51] he's giving jesus
[53:52] to his perspective because he thinks
[53:54] that's the correct application of the
[53:56] word
[53:57] he actually truly would apply it that
[53:59] way because
[54:01] in his heart he said i will and that's
[54:03] the mind of satan that's the way he
[54:05] thinks
[54:06] he doesn't want he doesn't want to
[54:08] follow god's will he just wants to use
[54:10] god's power for himself
[54:11] so that's the that's exactly the way
[54:13] satan is thinking so the third
[54:15] temptation he says
[54:17] all you have to do is bow down to me and
[54:19] i'll give you everything
[54:20] uh i'll give you the kingdoms of this
[54:22] world he shows them everything and
[54:24] i don't i don't know i always pictured
[54:25] him showing all the kingdoms of the
[54:27] world past
[54:28] present and future like all at the same
[54:30] time and saying this is mine
[54:32] can you imagine if i just gave it to you
[54:34] all you have to do is bend the knee
[54:35] for like two seconds and give me some
[54:38] worship
[54:38] that's all you have to do now from
[54:41] jesus's perspective you know
[54:43] that sounds like the easy way out
[54:45] because he wouldn't have to go through
[54:47] the suffering of the cross to die for
[54:48] our sins and then
[54:49] have a whole generations after
[54:52] generations of people deny his name
[54:54] and actually spurn the blood and the
[54:57] blood sacrifice that he's given us he
[54:58] would just get it immediately
[55:00] right there just by bowing down for a
[55:02] little bit but that wasn't god's will
[55:05] god's will was that he'd go through
[55:06] gethsemane he'd get he'd get
[55:08] uh he'd get he'd grow in character and
[55:11] that
[55:12] he would be the perfect sacrifice by the
[55:14] time that the sacrifice occurred
[55:16] he wasn't at that point yet he hadn't
[55:18] died out in gethsemane
[55:20] so um so back here it was very necessary
[55:25] that uh wait i lost my train of thought
[55:28] yeah it was very necessary that jesus go
[55:31] through all of these things and the
[55:32] devil
[55:32] just wants him to think of himself just
[55:34] for a little bit just for that one
[55:36] instant
[55:36] and the devil wants you to think the
[55:38] exact same thing now
[55:40] it's very applicable to the way you live
[55:43] your lives and what you go
[55:44] go throughout i mean the decisions you
[55:46] make throughout the day
[55:47] you might not be thinking much of those
[55:49] decisions but they might be tiny and the
[55:50] devil just wants you to compromise a
[55:52] little bit at a time just a little bit
[55:54] just a tiny bit in an inch at a time you
[55:56] give him an inch he's just gonna make it
[55:58] a little farther and a little farther
[56:00] all right so you just need to watch for
[56:02] that
[56:03] okay uh now i wanted to
[56:07] show you guys that this lane of this
[56:10] line of thinking is a very
[56:11] modern way of thinking have you guys
[56:14] how many people here in school i mean
[56:16] we're young people right who's doing
[56:18] school
[56:18] everybody most people okay how many
[56:21] people have been to school before
[56:22] right no you never went to kindergarten
[56:27] no okay well all right okay whatever
[56:30] um but if you go to school
[56:33] then they're going to probably show you
[56:35] something like the theory of
[56:37] evolution right and this drives me up
[56:39] the wall i cannot stand the theory of
[56:41] evolution because i
[56:44] i don't understand why you take the
[56:46] bible out of school
[56:47] and say that it's just a theory and that
[56:50] it's just religion
[56:51] and it's something that shouldn't be
[56:52] taught in school because there's no fact
[56:54] behind it
[56:54] and then replace it with the theory of
[56:57] evolution do you realize how ridiculous
[56:59] that sounds it's the theory
[57:01] so it's a theory why are we teaching it
[57:03] in school as if it's fact
[57:04] it's a theory in a theory for a theory
[57:08] to be
[57:08] to not become a theory and become fact
[57:11] science will tell you that
[57:12] it needs to be verifiable and repeatable
[57:16] that means you need to be able to take
[57:18] it through the scientific process
[57:20] and test it and then prove it and do it
[57:23] again and again and it comes up with the
[57:24] same results
[57:25] so that's the reason the theory of
[57:27] evolution is stuck where it is because
[57:28] you can't test it
[57:30] if you can't test it then it's still a
[57:32] theory
[57:33] but i know something right here that's
[57:35] been tested over and over again
[57:37] and it's not a theory anymore right
[57:40] it's not a theory to me you can see over
[57:43] and over again throughout people's lives
[57:44] there's recorded instances
[57:46] over and over again of the word being
[57:48] proved on the basis of
[57:50] itself god can square it swear by no
[57:53] higher than himself
[57:54] and that's the word right here he just
[57:56] proves it right here over and over again
[57:58] it's not a theory to me
[57:59] yet they'll rip it out of school and
[58:00] then they'll put the theory of evolution
[58:02] in there
[58:03] why i say it drives me crazy is because
[58:06] um
[58:06] not only does it stay cuz there's
[58:07] somewhere to put this not only does it
[58:09] stay
[58:11] as a thank you brother not only does it
[58:13] stay in school
[58:14] i'm just gonna get a little comfortable
[58:16] here i don't like sleeves
[58:18] um not only does it stay in the school
[58:22] but they try to put a political spin on
[58:24] things
[58:25] and everybody knows how politics goes
[58:27] 2020
[58:28] it's 2021 actually 2020 was a bad year
[58:30] for politics
[58:31] he saw black lives matter and all that
[58:33] stuff popping up and
[58:36] everybody just wants to prove that
[58:40] the way you're born is the way you're
[58:43] supposed to be
[58:44] and everybody should accept you for who
[58:46] you are
[58:48] and that's like the part that's that's
[58:50] where you find a lot of social justice
[58:52] warriors we were talking about hey
[58:54] this man is born and he has a spirit on
[58:56] him of hey
[58:57] liking other men or this woman likes
[58:59] other women that's just social justice
[59:01] because they say
[59:02] it's okay the way god made you is the
[59:05] way you're going to be
[59:06] and that's the way you should stay
[59:08] that's what that's what
[59:10] the politics of the day will tell you
[59:13] it'll keep pushing the stuff at you
[59:14] and it'll keep they'll keep doing it
[59:16] especially when i got to college that's
[59:18] whenever i start to realize that
[59:19] when i was 19 i first got here i came
[59:21] here for school
[59:23] i was out of the country before that and
[59:24] i came here and i was like man let's see
[59:26] what i can learn you know
[59:28] and uh i didn't think that i would be
[59:31] hit with so much
[59:32] stuff like this it's like there were
[59:34] there was black power movement
[59:36] there's a white power movement there are
[59:38] nazis there are
[59:39] people who are pushing their own agendas
[59:42] there are
[59:42] feminists there are transgenders there's
[59:45] lgbtq
[59:46] plus and all that stuff so many letters
[59:48] and it's just getting longer and longer
[59:49] and it's like do i need to really
[59:52] know and focus on all of these things
[59:53] it's like because there are so many
[59:55] different ways that people are born
[59:57] you got to recognize that the devil
[1:00:01] the gates of hell are opened at the
[1:00:03] moment and the devil is going to work
[1:00:04] his way through people and put different
[1:00:06] spirits on people such a different
[1:00:08] wide variety of people that are born
[1:00:11] and they just have different spirits
[1:00:13] that are born on them but the problem
[1:00:15] with
[1:00:16] the world's idea of democracy is the
[1:00:18] fact that
[1:00:19] they believe the way you're born is the
[1:00:20] way you're supposed to stay and god made
[1:00:22] you special wait
[1:00:23] no not god because they don't believe in
[1:00:25] god right they just believe that you
[1:00:26] were born special
[1:00:27] and everybody has a vote in everybody
[1:00:29] that's their idea
[1:00:30] of democracy you can't tell someone that
[1:00:33] they're more intelligent than somebody
[1:00:34] else because that's
[1:00:35] that's demeaning to them you can't speak
[1:00:38] the truth and say that something is
[1:00:40] right and something is wrong because
[1:00:41] that's demeaning to those people
[1:00:43] because everybody should be treated
[1:00:45] equally that's whenever
[1:00:47] you read the message you see brother
[1:00:48] branham say that that is the spirit of
[1:00:50] communism and i believe that
[1:00:52] because it's just wrong like to their
[1:00:55] minds they're just
[1:00:56] thinking that everyone can be the same
[1:01:00] and everyone needs to be treated
[1:01:03] perfectly well
[1:01:04] for all those wrong things that they're
[1:01:05] doing in the bedroom all the bad things
[1:01:07] that they support and all those
[1:01:09] spirits that they allow to come on them
[1:01:11] now
[1:01:12] if you know if you really know the word
[1:01:14] then you realize that
[1:01:16] we're not in a democracy we're in a
[1:01:18] monarchy
[1:01:19] god is king and we're in a democracy
[1:01:22] under that
[1:01:23] because god treats all of us equally he
[1:01:25] loves us all equally that's the true
[1:01:27] democracy that i believe in
[1:01:28] you know but their democracy if you want
[1:01:30] to there's actually a word for it
[1:01:33] i was listening to some sermons here and
[1:01:35] there and there was a man who
[1:01:36] defined it and he talked about it it's
[1:01:39] this word it's called humanism
[1:01:41] now humanism there's a few definitions i
[1:01:42] have for them
[1:01:44] and the first one is it's is a belief
[1:01:46] humanism
[1:01:47] oops humanism is a belief in the value
[1:01:51] freedom and independence of human beings
[1:01:53] that's what it says
[1:01:55] uh there's another one that says
[1:01:56] humanism and this is from the american
[1:01:58] humanist association
[1:01:59] you know an authority on humanism it
[1:02:02] says humanism
[1:02:03] is a progressive philosophy of life that
[1:02:05] without
[1:02:06] theism or other supernatural beliefs
[1:02:08] affirms our ability and responsibility
[1:02:10] to lead ethical lives
[1:02:12] of personal fulfillment that aspire to
[1:02:14] the greater good
[1:02:16] so i know that's a lot of words but i'm
[1:02:19] going to read a couple more definitions
[1:02:20] just hang on with me okay i know it's a
[1:02:22] lot of big words but whatever
[1:02:24] humanism is a rational philosophy
[1:02:27] informed by science
[1:02:29] inspired by art and motivated by
[1:02:32] compassion
[1:02:33] affirming the dignity of each human
[1:02:35] being that's that democracy they're
[1:02:37] talking about
[1:02:38] affirming the dignity of each human
[1:02:39] being it supports the maximization of
[1:02:42] individual liberty and opportunity
[1:02:45] consonant
[1:02:47] with social and planetary responsibility
[1:02:50] maximization of individual liberty now
[1:02:54] that's saying that however you are
[1:02:57] you should be loved by everybody and
[1:02:59] accepted by everybody
[1:03:01] and there's nothing wrong with you now
[1:03:04] i think that religion and christianity
[1:03:08] i think that that is one of the only
[1:03:10] places you can go to
[1:03:11] that allows you to accept yourself for
[1:03:13] what you really are
[1:03:15] tells you body soul and spirit what you
[1:03:17] are
[1:03:18] and provides a path for self-improvement
[1:03:22] now the way they're talking right here
[1:03:24] is the way you are
[1:03:25] is perfect and you're okay and we accept
[1:03:28] you just like that
[1:03:30] but we accept that we understand that
[1:03:32] we've fallen short of the mark of god
[1:03:34] amen we recognize that we needed a
[1:03:36] savior we needed salvation we needed all
[1:03:38] of these things
[1:03:39] and it's out of our control to get there
[1:03:42] we need god to show us
[1:03:44] we needed god to show us the way we
[1:03:45] needed him to come down and die
[1:03:47] on the cross and shed his blood and to
[1:03:49] do everything because we are weak
[1:03:51] we are weak as human beings we realize
[1:03:53] this flesh is just temporary and we're
[1:03:55] going to die
[1:03:55] we don't have the strength to do
[1:03:57] anything beyond this um
[1:03:59] beyond our flesh we couldn't help our
[1:04:01] own spirits we couldn't we couldn't help
[1:04:03] our souls we couldn't provide
[1:04:04] any sort of payment to pay for that we
[1:04:06] couldn't do any of that we needed god
[1:04:09] and okay there's another one here it
[1:04:11] says humanists believe that human
[1:04:13] experience and rational thinking
[1:04:15] provide the only source of knowledge and
[1:04:18] a moral code
[1:04:19] to live by that's one of my favorite
[1:04:21] ones because it says that there's a
[1:04:23] moral code
[1:04:24] and if you go to
[1:04:28] if you go to school in uh probably
[1:04:30] college university whatever
[1:04:32] and you go to an ethics class ethics is
[1:04:35] talking about morality
[1:04:36] and what's good and what's wrong what's
[1:04:38] good what's bad what you should do and
[1:04:40] what you shouldn't do but if you go to
[1:04:41] the ethics class they're going to tell
[1:04:43] you that
[1:04:43] what's considered ethical is
[1:04:47] relative to the person opinion
[1:04:51] that means what elijah right there
[1:04:54] thinks is ethical i'm not going to think
[1:04:57] is ethical
[1:04:58] but that's his version of what's ethical
[1:05:00] and my version is different
[1:05:02] and it depends on each person what is
[1:05:04] right and what is wrong
[1:05:05] they'll tell you that everything is
[1:05:07] right and everything is wrong
[1:05:09] depending on the person it depends on
[1:05:11] who has the opinion in the first place
[1:05:13] i know that's kind of confusing but hang
[1:05:15] on with me but i think that's ridiculous
[1:05:17] because
[1:05:19] if you go to that class and a professor
[1:05:22] tries to teach you
[1:05:23] that whatever you decide to do is right
[1:05:26] or wrong it's okay
[1:05:27] there's no such thing as a scientific
[1:05:30] origin of ethics
[1:05:32] then you go to that class i dare you to
[1:05:34] cheat in that class and cheat on the
[1:05:35] final exam
[1:05:36] what's the teacher going to do he's
[1:05:39] going to fail you
[1:05:40] even though it's right in your mind
[1:05:43] right let's say cheating was right right
[1:05:45] just tell them hey cheating was right
[1:05:47] because i thought it was right to them
[1:05:49] they say it was
[1:05:50] wrong therefore you're going to fail the
[1:05:51] class so it automatically doesn't even
[1:05:53] make sense
[1:05:54] i don't know that seems really confusing
[1:05:55] i can see the blank looks on your faces
[1:05:57] right now
[1:05:58] okay so to them let me try to break it
[1:06:02] down again
[1:06:02] um let's say i think stealing is right
[1:06:07] and there's nothing in science that can
[1:06:10] tell me that stealing is wrong
[1:06:11] that means i should be allowed to steal
[1:06:13] as much as i want from wherever i want
[1:06:15] and according to science there's nothing
[1:06:17] wrong with that
[1:06:18] that means i should be allowed to hit
[1:06:20] somebody and walk away
[1:06:22] with no recrimination violence uh
[1:06:25] murder anything that i decide to do
[1:06:28] should be right according to me
[1:06:29] so according to science since they can't
[1:06:32] prove that it's wrong
[1:06:33] and according to modern political
[1:06:36] thinking since they can't prove that
[1:06:37] it's wrong
[1:06:38] therefore it must be right to you and
[1:06:40] therefore it's okay
[1:06:42] but if that were true why do we have
[1:06:43] prisons why is there a law
[1:06:46] what is that based on where did that
[1:06:48] come from that's the question
[1:06:50] if you ask them where society's laws
[1:06:52] came from
[1:06:53] and where the bill of rights and the
[1:06:56] declaration of independence came from
[1:06:57] guess what they're going to tell you
[1:06:59] here they came from the bible
[1:07:01] that's where all those rules came from
[1:07:03] in the first place it came from
[1:07:04] spiritual minded men who were trying to
[1:07:06] do the best for their country
[1:07:08] and setting everything in order but they
[1:07:09] used a book as a basis for that
[1:07:12] and since they threw that out the window
[1:07:13] they have to come up with a whole bunch
[1:07:15] of justifications for how something is
[1:07:17] right
[1:07:18] in everybody's heart even though it goes
[1:07:20] against the word of god
[1:07:22] they have to say hey look we have a bill
[1:07:24] of rights but that's not important
[1:07:25] because
[1:07:26] you know science says that there is no
[1:07:28] law there's no basis for our law there's
[1:07:30] nothing
[1:07:32] repeatable there's nothing to show you
[1:07:34] in the word
[1:07:35] i mean there's nothing to show you in
[1:07:36] science that can prove that that law is
[1:07:38] correct
[1:07:39] there's nothing in science that can tell
[1:07:40] me that i shouldn't murder somebody
[1:07:43] and i just think that's just a backwards
[1:07:45] way of thinking
[1:07:47] now keep in mind that whole spirit comes
[1:07:50] from the devil in the first place this
[1:07:51] is the this is the devil's way of
[1:07:52] thinking
[1:07:54] and you're probably going to hear this
[1:07:55] if god's such a good god why did he let
[1:07:57] those people die
[1:07:58] anybody ever heard that before i've
[1:08:00] heard that lots of times right
[1:08:01] why did he let those people in the in
[1:08:03] the bible die why did he let this happen
[1:08:05] why did he let that happen
[1:08:06] so to them um wait actually there's this
[1:08:09] lady
[1:08:10] uh i've never told you guys this story
[1:08:12] before but there's this lady who
[1:08:15] i work with and she was talking to me
[1:08:17] and
[1:08:18] she has a she has a perverse spirit on
[1:08:21] her she's a lesbian
[1:08:23] and she said she read the whole bible
[1:08:26] one time
[1:08:26] but she was a health care worker so she
[1:08:28] had seen healing happen
[1:08:30] and she couldn't deny that there was a
[1:08:31] god but she
[1:08:33] didn't didn't accept what the bible said
[1:08:36] so she didn't like religion but she
[1:08:38] couldn't deny that there was a god
[1:08:41] so we've had a lot of arguments
[1:08:44] let's just say that um but one of them
[1:08:48] she uh she was talking to me and we were
[1:08:50] talking on the subject of what's in the
[1:08:51] bible
[1:08:53] and she told me that she doesn't believe
[1:08:56] that god
[1:08:57] told people with she told me that she
[1:09:00] doesn't believe that anybody
[1:09:02] that god would tell anybody to kill
[1:09:04] somebody else
[1:09:06] that he would never tell you to kill
[1:09:07] somebody else well
[1:09:09] i told her when i opened the bible and
[1:09:10] i'll go to the old testament
[1:09:12] it shows a lot of instances it told
[1:09:14] joshua to kill a lot of people
[1:09:16] he got armies together and killed whole
[1:09:18] cities so i said
[1:09:20] my bible says that god would show some
[1:09:22] people to do that
[1:09:24] and she didn't take that very well so
[1:09:26] she said
[1:09:27] that wasn't god she said whoever was in
[1:09:29] the bible telling them to do that they
[1:09:31] must have had dreams
[1:09:32] and they must have come up with it on
[1:09:33] their own because god would never tell
[1:09:35] them to do that
[1:09:36] and i told her well we had a very
[1:09:40] we had a pretty strong argument after
[1:09:42] that each side was trying to present
[1:09:44] their side then
[1:09:45] like we stopped the conversation we
[1:09:47] walked away and after a while i was
[1:09:48] thinking about it and i was just
[1:09:50] like in her mind
[1:09:54] i realized that there was no way our our
[1:09:56] discussion would come to a
[1:09:59] a good conclusion like there was no way
[1:10:01] we would see eye to eye
[1:10:02] because in her mind
[1:10:05] she had an absolute that she made up in
[1:10:07] her head to me i had an absolute that i
[1:10:09] could see in the word
[1:10:11] so all of my arguments were based on
[1:10:12] this but she didn't even have this
[1:10:14] so to her she said i have an idea of
[1:10:17] what god is in my mind
[1:10:19] and i'm going to hold on to that and i'm
[1:10:22] going to
[1:10:24] live my testimony based on that idea in
[1:10:26] my mind and it was wrong
[1:10:28] but she was still going to go on with it
[1:10:30] and she was still going to push forward
[1:10:31] with it
[1:10:31] what happens whenever you come up with
[1:10:33] your own idea of what god is
[1:10:35] that becomes an idol and that's exactly
[1:10:37] what they had in the old testament
[1:10:39] they had their own ideas of what god
[1:10:41] does and what he's supposed to do and
[1:10:42] how he's supposed to move
[1:10:44] and they packed them into these little
[1:10:45] wooden statues and stone statues and
[1:10:47] ceramic statues whatever you see they
[1:10:50] made them their selves
[1:10:51] and then they said hey this is god right
[1:10:54] here
[1:10:54] and this is what he's able to do and
[1:10:56] most of those gods didn't even create
[1:10:58] the universe they were just gods of
[1:10:59] little pieces
[1:11:00] like this is the god of the trees or
[1:11:02] this is the god of lightning that's the
[1:11:03] god of water
[1:11:04] you know they had different gods but
[1:11:06] that's not what god is god is god of
[1:11:08] everything
[1:11:09] he's god of me and you he's god body
[1:11:11] soul and spirit everything you can see
[1:11:12] and that you can't see
[1:11:14] the intangible in the in the tangible
[1:11:16] all of it together god's still god
[1:11:18] just like brother caleb was saying god
[1:11:19] is god you can do any of those things
[1:11:22] and more that we don't even understand
[1:11:24] he's beyond our comprehension
[1:11:26] amen okay so this is the arg
[1:11:31] let's see this is the thought that goes
[1:11:33] through most people's head
[1:11:34] god they're told that god is a good god
[1:11:36] first right
[1:11:38] so they say if god is a good god
[1:11:41] he loves me that's true god loves us
[1:11:44] right
[1:11:45] but then they get derailed off of that
[1:11:46] because they're like therefore
[1:11:48] if god loves me he wants me
[1:11:52] to have everything i want
[1:11:55] that's where it goes south it's not the
[1:11:56] right thing anymore
[1:11:58] granted god wants you to have all good
[1:12:01] things all good blessings
[1:12:03] but he is the one who knows whether it's
[1:12:05] good for you or not he knows the
[1:12:06] appropriate time for you to have
[1:12:08] it yes so
[1:12:12] so they say that uh oh wait
[1:12:15] i got i got lost somewhere
[1:12:21] okay yeah so that's the line of thinking
[1:12:23] therefore if god
[1:12:26] wants me to have everything that i want
[1:12:28] i can take everything i want
[1:12:30] that that's what that means that means i
[1:12:31] can do what i want and i can still be
[1:12:33] justified by god those people who
[1:12:35] who accept salvation for their souls but
[1:12:38] only do it halfway and don't go all the
[1:12:40] way to get the holy ghost and seek god's
[1:12:42] leading
[1:12:43] that's where they end up stuck because
[1:12:45] they're just thinking hey
[1:12:47] now that i've been saved and since i've
[1:12:49] been predestinated and everything that
[1:12:50] means i can do
[1:12:51] everything that i want to do and god's
[1:12:53] not going to do anything
[1:12:54] i'm still going to make it to heaven and
[1:12:56] that's not right that's not that's not
[1:12:58] what god wants you to stop at he wants
[1:12:59] you to seek his mind
[1:13:01] he wants you to seek after his will and
[1:13:03] to grow
[1:13:04] in the in the body and spirit everywhere
[1:13:06] he wants you to grow
[1:13:07] in him to be more like him he wants to
[1:13:09] give you better character
[1:13:10] but if you keep putting up blocks like
[1:13:12] that saying that i want this and i want
[1:13:15] that and i'm going to insert this
[1:13:16] that's exactly what the devil does in
[1:13:19] his own thinking that's where that's
[1:13:21] what got satan where he is right now
[1:13:23] so uh i actually want to look at a few
[1:13:26] uh examples
[1:13:28] of uh of what the devil was doing and
[1:13:33] what the what his agents were thinking
[1:13:35] so let's go to numbers chapter 13.
[1:13:41] uh let's see
[1:13:46] yeah numbers 13 verse 26
[1:13:50] so this is after uh
[1:13:54] moses sends out the 12 spies to go spy
[1:13:56] out canaan
[1:13:58] and uh they hadn't moses hadn't died yet
[1:14:01] so they weren't going to enter into
[1:14:03] the promised land yet because of this
[1:14:06] moment of failure
[1:14:07] it's that kadish barnia and they had a
[1:14:10] moment of decision to make
[1:14:11] where they either choose to go god's way
[1:14:13] and to take him at his word
[1:14:14] or to fall back and not go all the way
[1:14:17] through
[1:14:18] so verse 26 it says and they went and
[1:14:20] came these are the spies coming back to
[1:14:22] moses with their report
[1:14:23] it says and they went and came to moses
[1:14:25] into aaron and to all the congregation
[1:14:27] of the children of israel
[1:14:29] unto the wilderness apparent to kadish
[1:14:31] and brought back word
[1:14:32] unto them and unto all the congregation
[1:14:35] and showed them the fruit of the land so
[1:14:37] they couldn't deny that there were
[1:14:38] fruits
[1:14:39] and what god had promised would be there
[1:14:41] was already there
[1:14:42] they couldn't deny that because they
[1:14:44] could see it there
[1:14:45] they actually brought back the fruits
[1:14:47] and said hey this is what god
[1:14:49] promised us and here it is in our hands
[1:14:51] they couldn't deny that
[1:14:53] so verse 27 it says and they told him
[1:14:57] and said
[1:14:57] we came unto the land whither thou sent
[1:14:59] us dust
[1:15:00] and surely it floweth with milk and
[1:15:03] honey and this
[1:15:04] is the fruit of it so they're still
[1:15:05] showing them the fruits nevertheless
[1:15:08] the people keep in mind they talked
[1:15:10] about a bushel of grapes
[1:15:11] that was so big that it took two men to
[1:15:14] carry it
[1:15:15] right it was like gigantic so they like
[1:15:17] held it between them
[1:15:19] on their backs just like that that's how
[1:15:21] big the bushel of graves was
[1:15:22] so 12 men went in 12 minutes came out
[1:15:26] says nevertheless the people be strong
[1:15:27] that dwell in the land
[1:15:29] and the cities are walled and very great
[1:15:32] and moreover we saw the children
[1:15:33] of anak there verse 29
[1:15:38] and just just watch this verse closely
[1:15:40] it says the amalekites
[1:15:42] dwell in the land of the south and the
[1:15:44] hittites
[1:15:45] and the jebusites and the amorites dwell
[1:15:48] in the mountains and the
[1:15:49] and the can and the canaanites dwell by
[1:15:51] the sea and by the coast of jordan
[1:15:53] so you got to think these men went over
[1:15:56] there
[1:15:56] and saw you can equate these to demons
[1:16:00] in anything you'd like to because that's
[1:16:02] how that's what
[1:16:04] israel does it types the church of
[1:16:05] nowadays so they went over there
[1:16:07] and they saw all the opposition of the
[1:16:09] devil came back
[1:16:10] and they just started testifying on
[1:16:12] behalf of the devil saying look there
[1:16:14] are fruits
[1:16:15] yes so i admit that what god said is
[1:16:17] true in his word
[1:16:19] but there's so much to to fight against
[1:16:22] me
[1:16:22] that i'm not gonna take it because they
[1:16:24] said look there's all these jebusites
[1:16:26] there's all these ice there's amorites
[1:16:28] there's canaanites there's just so many
[1:16:29] of them
[1:16:30] the anakin all of them and then they
[1:16:32] start talking about
[1:16:34] how it would be so hard to follow the
[1:16:36] will of the lord
[1:16:37] even though the fruits were there so
[1:16:39] they took the devil's testimony
[1:16:40] and put it up here and denied the lords
[1:16:43] they had his down here
[1:16:44] so they took the devil's opinion it was
[1:16:46] just ever so slightly high
[1:16:48] like they just took that and they just
[1:16:50] could not unsee it
[1:16:51] that's what the devil wants you to do so
[1:16:54] verse 30 it says
[1:16:55] and caleb stilled the people before
[1:16:57] moses and said let us go up at once and
[1:16:59] possess it
[1:17:00] for we are well able to overcome it but
[1:17:03] the men that went up with him said we be
[1:17:05] not able to go up against the people for
[1:17:06] they are stronger than we
[1:17:08] see they took the devil's word for it
[1:17:10] and they brought up an evil report
[1:17:12] of the land which they had searched unto
[1:17:14] the children of israel saying
[1:17:16] the land through which we have gone to
[1:17:18] search it is a land that eateth up the
[1:17:20] inhabitants thereof
[1:17:21] and all the people that we saw in it are
[1:17:24] men of a great stature
[1:17:26] and there we saw the giants the son of
[1:17:28] the sons of anak which
[1:17:29] come of the giants here's the important
[1:17:31] part and we were in our own sight
[1:17:34] as grasshoppers and so we were in their
[1:17:37] sight
[1:17:37] you understand at that point since they
[1:17:40] since they took the devil's testimony at
[1:17:42] the beginning they had a low opinion of
[1:17:45] themselves
[1:17:46] it says and so we were in their sight
[1:17:48] because i have a low opinion of myself
[1:17:50] then the devil has a better opinion of
[1:17:52] himself and makes me look weak
[1:17:55] that's exactly how it the devil will use
[1:17:58] that over and over again to discourage
[1:18:00] you and make you doubt god's word
[1:18:02] and whenever he brings you down makes
[1:18:04] you so discouraged that you don't want
[1:18:06] to take a step forward
[1:18:08] that's whenever he looks down he's like
[1:18:09] i got him i got her that child of god
[1:18:12] i i just i don't even have to work
[1:18:14] anymore because they're just stuck down
[1:18:15] there and they don't think any better of
[1:18:17] themselves
[1:18:18] that's where that's what the devil wants
[1:18:20] you and that's his perspective also
[1:18:23] but there are there's a couple of cases
[1:18:26] in the bible
[1:18:27] where the children of israel and other
[1:18:30] people
[1:18:30] don't let the devil get them down and
[1:18:32] actually rise up to the occasion where
[1:18:34] they
[1:18:35] where god wants them to be and have a
[1:18:36] better opinion of themselves
[1:18:38] often enough it takes god's intervention
[1:18:40] personally
[1:18:42] for them to realize where their place
[1:18:44] was and then to rise to the occasion
[1:18:46] so one of them is in joshua let's go to
[1:18:48] chapter two
[1:18:51] joshua two verse one
[1:18:58] so this is after they wandered in the
[1:19:00] wilderness because they failed at
[1:19:01] canada's parnia
[1:19:02] still the children of israel and uh
[1:19:06] it comes back moses dies aaron dies i
[1:19:08] think miriam dies after that
[1:19:10] and joshua is the one leading the
[1:19:12] children of israel now
[1:19:13] and he's pointing them at the word of
[1:19:14] moses and bringing that to the forefront
[1:19:17] and it says in joshua chapter 2 it says
[1:19:20] and joshua the son of nun
[1:19:22] sent out of sh to ten two men who
[1:19:25] to spy secretly saying go view the land
[1:19:27] even jericho
[1:19:28] and they went and came into a harlot's
[1:19:30] house named rahab
[1:19:31] and lodged there and it was told the
[1:19:34] king of jericho saying behold there came
[1:19:36] men in
[1:19:37] in hither tonight of the children of
[1:19:38] israel to search out the city
[1:19:40] so first of all let me point this out
[1:19:43] these are just two men
[1:19:44] and they're the worst spies i've ever
[1:19:46] heard of like the
[1:19:47] absolute worst if you think about it
[1:19:49] moses day
[1:19:51] he sent 12 men into this land
[1:19:54] and they wandered back and forth through
[1:19:57] multiple cities
[1:19:58] nobody caught them they went all
[1:20:01] throughout that place they even managed
[1:20:02] to steal a bushel of grapes
[1:20:04] came back out and the canaanites never
[1:20:08] knew that they were there
[1:20:09] but these two men they're just really
[1:20:12] terrible because they
[1:20:13] walk in and they go straight into the
[1:20:14] first city i think it's probably the
[1:20:16] first day
[1:20:17] they walk in there and not only do they
[1:20:19] get found out
[1:20:20] they end up in the red light district
[1:20:22] district near rahab's house because she
[1:20:24] was a harlot right
[1:20:25] so she was the wrong side of town they
[1:20:27] end up there and not only that but they
[1:20:29] end up
[1:20:29] stuck on her house on her rooftop
[1:20:33] and their lives are at the mercy of just
[1:20:35] a regular old harlot
[1:20:36] in the middle of a city so at that point
[1:20:38] i don't know if i were you but i'd be
[1:20:40] seriously discouraged
[1:20:42] i'd be really discouraged because i'd be
[1:20:43] like well
[1:20:45] we can't do anything right now if you go
[1:20:46] down to verse 8 it says and before they
[1:20:48] were laid down
[1:20:50] because they were going to stay the
[1:20:51] night before they were laid down she
[1:20:53] came up
[1:20:54] unto them upon the roof so you're going
[1:20:56] to see the story change
[1:20:58] because even though they were in a bad
[1:21:00] place of discouragement
[1:21:02] even though they were the children of
[1:21:03] god they've been caught and found out by
[1:21:05] the enemy
[1:21:05] and they were stuck on a rooftop and
[1:21:07] just hiding in a house and all that
[1:21:09] stuff
[1:21:09] even though all of that is going down
[1:21:11] and their spirits are at their lowest
[1:21:13] god comes down and uses them lips of
[1:21:16] rahab
[1:21:17] a harlot to encourage them
[1:21:20] and to lift up their spirits just look
[1:21:22] at what she says verse 9
[1:21:23] and she said unto the men i know that
[1:21:26] the lord hath given you the land
[1:21:28] and that your terror is fallen upon us
[1:21:31] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:21:33] faint because of you now if i was
[1:21:36] standing there and someone told me that
[1:21:37] in that condition i'd be like are you
[1:21:39] sure you have the right guy i mean look
[1:21:41] at me
[1:21:41] i'm just stuck in the red light district
[1:21:44] like in
[1:21:45] in two seconds if you say the wrong word
[1:21:47] guards are going to kick down your door
[1:21:48] and come up and kill us
[1:21:49] that's like the worst thing that could
[1:21:51] happen to me right now and
[1:21:53] you're telling me that all the
[1:21:54] inhabitants of the land faint because of
[1:21:56] us if you actually look at their
[1:21:58] their king their not their kingdom but
[1:22:00] their nation where they were
[1:22:02] they they were about to cross the
[1:22:06] i'm pretty sure they were about to cross
[1:22:07] the river jordan they hadn't crossed it
[1:22:10] yet
[1:22:10] so there was no way to cross the river
[1:22:12] jordan at that moment
[1:22:14] and all of them have been wandering the
[1:22:15] wilderness like
[1:22:17] all the old generation had died so all
[1:22:19] of these people were adults
[1:22:21] that only knew about wandering the
[1:22:23] wilderness they didn't know about living
[1:22:24] in cities
[1:22:25] they were just men women and children
[1:22:27] just regular folk who didn't know how to
[1:22:29] fight
[1:22:29] they didn't have any weapons of war they
[1:22:31] didn't even have real weapons for real
[1:22:33] like they probably killed the king of
[1:22:34] hog by that time so they had a few
[1:22:36] weapons but they weren't like
[1:22:37] an actual invincible army and you look
[1:22:40] at the walls of jericho
[1:22:41] brother branham said that they could run
[1:22:43] two chariots on top
[1:22:44] side by side that's how big they were
[1:22:46] that's how thick they were
[1:22:48] and that's just how huge they were and
[1:22:51] they had weapons of war the city was
[1:22:53] basically impregnable you could not get
[1:22:55] inside there
[1:22:56] and she said all the inhabitants of the
[1:22:59] land
[1:22:59] faint because of you these people in
[1:23:01] their their clothes that were
[1:23:02] hand-me-downs from
[1:23:04] years before like 40 years old clothes
[1:23:06] that's how old they were from their
[1:23:08] parents
[1:23:09] and they don't even know how to look for
[1:23:10] food or anything like that because
[1:23:12] they're used to food falling out of the
[1:23:14] sky they don't even know how to
[1:23:15] i mean how to pluck fruits out of the
[1:23:17] trees or anything like that they don't
[1:23:18] know how to harvest they don't know how
[1:23:19] to plant they don't know anything
[1:23:21] and they're scared of the of the
[1:23:24] children of israel
[1:23:25] they're just scared of them all the
[1:23:27] people of jericho and it goes on in
[1:23:29] verse 10 she continues to testify
[1:23:31] basically on god's behalf he's using her
[1:23:34] it says for we have heard how the lord
[1:23:37] dried up the water of the red sea for
[1:23:38] you
[1:23:39] when he came out when he came out of
[1:23:41] egypt and what he did unto the two kings
[1:23:43] of the amorites that were on the other
[1:23:45] side
[1:23:45] jordan sihan and og whom you utterly
[1:23:49] destroyed
[1:23:50] and as soon as we heard these things our
[1:23:51] hearts did melt neither did there remain
[1:23:53] any more courage in any man because of
[1:23:55] you for the lord your god he is god in
[1:23:58] heaven above
[1:23:59] and in earth beneath and she was
[1:24:01] testifying to god
[1:24:02] their god not the god of the the
[1:24:05] canaanites not whoever those gods were
[1:24:07] because there had to be plenty of gods
[1:24:08] by them with all those kingdoms
[1:24:10] not those gods but she testified that
[1:24:13] their god
[1:24:14] was true god that he had the strength
[1:24:17] she just
[1:24:17] heard some stories that were told of
[1:24:20] people who travel
[1:24:21] traveled over the river jordan at that
[1:24:23] point so all she had were stories to go
[1:24:25] off of
[1:24:26] and she had a great testimony and then
[1:24:28] at the end of it
[1:24:30] if you go down to verse 23 it says so
[1:24:32] the two men returned keep in mind
[1:24:34] they've been encouraged by
[1:24:35] what the what the harlot said it says so
[1:24:39] the two men returned and descended from
[1:24:41] the mountain and passed over
[1:24:42] and came to joshua the son of nun and
[1:24:44] told him all these things that befell
[1:24:46] them
[1:24:46] and they said unto joshua truly the lord
[1:24:49] hath delivered into our hands all the
[1:24:50] land
[1:24:51] for even all the inhabitants of the
[1:24:53] country do faint
[1:24:54] because of us so the testimony of their
[1:24:57] enemy
[1:24:58] changed their own testimony changed
[1:25:00] their own lives
[1:25:01] and if you remember after that the the
[1:25:04] kingdom of jericho just fell
[1:25:05] they just took the will of the lord they
[1:25:07] took that testimony and they rolled with
[1:25:09] it
[1:25:09] just because they could see what was in
[1:25:12] the mind of satan they could see that
[1:25:14] all of satan's agents were scared of
[1:25:17] them
[1:25:17] that's all it took just seeing what the
[1:25:19] devil thinks of you and i'm just telling
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:21] this for your own self you realize the
[1:25:23] devil is actually really scared of us
[1:25:25] right now
[1:25:26] coming in the church right now and
[1:25:28] singing like caleb saying like brother
[1:25:29] isaiah is saying coming over here
[1:25:31] sacrificing our time and welcoming the
[1:25:33] presence of the lord he's scared of
[1:25:35] something like this happening because he
[1:25:37] knows a change can happen in each and
[1:25:38] one
[1:25:38] each and every one of your lives he's
[1:25:40] scared right now and i'm just trying to
[1:25:42] show you that
[1:25:43] because that's just the way he thinks
[1:25:45] first of all
[1:25:46] he thinks that his will is the best will
[1:25:49] he wants your will to be like his will
[1:25:51] which is basically not god's will
[1:25:53] and then second sorry third he wants
[1:25:57] he wants you to be to think little of
[1:25:59] yourself he wants you down here
[1:26:01] he wants you way down here because if he
[1:26:03] can if he can get you to think that way
[1:26:05] that's the way you're gonna be and
[1:26:07] that's all it takes
[1:26:09] okay let's look at another situation
[1:26:11] because it happens throughout the bible
[1:26:13] let's go to judges chapter seven um
[1:26:16] verse
[1:26:17] nine and uh yeah so this is
[1:26:22] this is the story of gideon
[1:26:26] in the book of judges and gideon he
[1:26:29] started his army
[1:26:30] wait he didn't even start his army he's
[1:26:33] like many christians
[1:26:34] today it takes a lot of proof especially
[1:26:36] in this day and age you know in a
[1:26:38] scientific
[1:26:38] age a way we think is just like hey we
[1:26:41] need to see proof of this stuff
[1:26:42] happening for us to believe it
[1:26:44] so gideon is exactly the same way he's
[1:26:47] minded the same way we are
[1:26:48] so uh he has a visitation from the lord
[1:26:53] and let me just speed through his story
[1:26:55] so he tests the visitation of the lord
[1:26:58] in order to make sure that he was really
[1:27:00] called and then
[1:27:01] when the lord told him hey go down tear
[1:27:04] down that idol in the middle of the city
[1:27:05] he runs out
[1:27:06] and he waits till it's the cover of
[1:27:08] night now
[1:27:10] let's say if we had a visitation of the
[1:27:12] lord like god came down in a dream
[1:27:14] or an angel came and spoke to you or
[1:27:17] something
[1:27:18] super spiritual happened to you would
[1:27:20] you try testing him
[1:27:22] like i i would test it by the word yes
[1:27:24] and make sure it's an actual experience
[1:27:26] but i wouldn't say hey
[1:27:27] i wouldn't i don't think i would do what
[1:27:29] gideon said like
[1:27:31] but we don't know what we'll do until
[1:27:33] we're in that situation
[1:27:34] most of us think that way like hey what
[1:27:37] gideon did was he had this fleece on the
[1:27:39] ground he had
[1:27:40] god like make it wet around the fleece
[1:27:42] but leave the fleas dry then he switched
[1:27:44] it around and had it done backwards so
[1:27:45] we tested him like two or three times
[1:27:47] before he actually accepted his calling
[1:27:50] then when god told gideon hey go
[1:27:52] tear down that idol he waits till it's
[1:27:53] night time and he sneaks over there
[1:27:56] because he's scared of people coming and
[1:27:58] giving him some retribution they were
[1:28:00] just he was just scared that they would
[1:28:01] come and kill him for tearing down the
[1:28:03] idol
[1:28:03] so he sneaks over there does the work
[1:28:06] and all that stuff
[1:28:07] but uh eventually he gets where god
[1:28:09] wants him to be he has the army
[1:28:11] 32 000 god breaks it down to about 300
[1:28:14] men
[1:28:15] and when he has the 300 men he's still
[1:28:18] thinking after all of those things that
[1:28:20] he's seen god bring him through
[1:28:22] all of those steps that god took him
[1:28:24] through and proved things
[1:28:26] over and over again and had so much
[1:28:27] patience with gideon
[1:28:29] after all of those things
[1:28:32] he must have still had some doubt in his
[1:28:33] heart because
[1:28:35] god does this so he goes let's pull up
[1:28:38] judges chapter seven
[1:28:39] um in verse nine it says and it came to
[1:28:42] pass the same night
[1:28:43] keep in mind he only has 300 men and
[1:28:45] it's like they they have so many enemies
[1:28:47] they can't even come
[1:28:48] so i have no no idea how many hundreds
[1:28:50] of thousands or millions there were
[1:28:53] it said and it came to pass the same
[1:28:54] night that the lord said unto him
[1:28:57] speaking to gideon arise get thee down
[1:28:59] unto the host for i have delivered it
[1:29:01] into thine hand but if thou fear to go
[1:29:04] down
[1:29:05] go thou with pura thy servant down to
[1:29:07] the host
[1:29:08] and thou shalt hear what they say and
[1:29:10] afterward shall thine hands be
[1:29:12] strengthened
[1:29:13] to go down unto the host
[1:29:16] then when he down with fury his servant
[1:29:18] unto the outside of the armed men that
[1:29:20] were in the host
[1:29:21] and the medianites and the malachites
[1:29:22] and all the children of the east lay
[1:29:24] along in the valley these are all their
[1:29:26] enemies
[1:29:26] like grasshoppers for multitude and
[1:29:28] their camels were without number
[1:29:30] their camels were without number not
[1:29:31] even soldiers or horses or any other
[1:29:33] thing
[1:29:34] they were without number as the sand by
[1:29:36] the sea for multitude
[1:29:38] and when gideon was come behold there
[1:29:40] was a man that
[1:29:41] told a dream unto his fellow
[1:29:45] and said and this is keep in mind this
[1:29:47] is god
[1:29:48] just showing gideon what his enemies
[1:29:50] think about him
[1:29:52] it's going to change the entire
[1:29:53] situation
[1:29:55] told a dream unto his fellow and said
[1:29:57] behold i dreamed a dream and lo
[1:29:59] a cake of barley bread tumbled into the
[1:30:01] host of
[1:30:02] midian and came unto a tent and smote it
[1:30:04] that it fell
[1:30:05] and overturned it that the tent lay
[1:30:08] along
[1:30:09] and his fellow answered and said this is
[1:30:11] nothing else save the sword of gideon
[1:30:13] the son of joash a man of israel and
[1:30:15] into his hand have god delivered midian
[1:30:17] and all the hosts so he also has
[1:30:19] this enemy come and testify on gideon's
[1:30:22] behalf
[1:30:22] so if you realize that your enemy thinks
[1:30:24] so highly of you
[1:30:26] that he's running scared it could change
[1:30:28] your whole life situation
[1:30:30] just accept the word the way god wanted
[1:30:32] you to
[1:30:33] accept the word and every step that you
[1:30:35] take in life it's super important
[1:30:37] to consult it if you can honestly not
[1:30:40] everything like hey do i go to burger
[1:30:42] king or taco bell after this now
[1:30:44] don't have to test it there you don't
[1:30:45] have to search the word for that but
[1:30:47] if there's a spiritual question there's
[1:30:49] a spiritual answer there's a spiritual
[1:30:51] path that god has for you
[1:30:52] in your life make sure to test it
[1:30:56] i don't really know how long i've been
[1:30:57] speaking but i'm almost done so let me
[1:31:00] just keep going
[1:31:02] i just want to ask you do you
[1:31:06] whenever you're whenever you doubt
[1:31:08] yourself
[1:31:10] do you automatically think the devil's
[1:31:12] lying to you because
[1:31:14] i want to ask you
[1:31:17] who's lying to who are you just lying to
[1:31:19] yourself it could be you
[1:31:21] just testifying on behalf of the devil
[1:31:24] and that would bring you down a peg
[1:31:26] the devil sometimes just sits back and
[1:31:28] sees what you're going to think
[1:31:29] and it's often the wrong thing if you
[1:31:32] let him
[1:31:33] if you let him lower your opinion of
[1:31:35] yourself
[1:31:36] and don't realize that you're a chosen
[1:31:38] child of god and that you're an elected
[1:31:40] seed if you let him
[1:31:42] if you let him have you forget that then
[1:31:46] it's going to go badly for you if god
[1:31:49] wants you up here
[1:31:50] just look at the look at the back of the
[1:31:52] book and realize that god has such a
[1:31:54] high opinion of you
[1:31:56] that he will not let you fail ultimately
[1:31:59] he he he wants the best for you to seek
[1:32:01] his will
[1:32:02] he knows how to get you there and as
[1:32:04] young people there's so many decisions
[1:32:06] we have to make and
[1:32:07] it's just it can be hard
[1:32:11] and honestly a lot of the decisions we
[1:32:13] make are
[1:32:14] sometimes harder than previous
[1:32:16] generations because the world gets
[1:32:18] harder and harder to live in
[1:32:20] and so many choices we have to make
[1:32:22] choices that we've never
[1:32:24] they never had to deal with and it's
[1:32:26] just going to get worse from here
[1:32:27] we need to be stronger as a generation
[1:32:30] because
[1:32:31] our kids need to be strengthened too
[1:32:32] they need to be strengthened in the word
[1:32:34] they need to
[1:32:34] live off of our testimony and understand
[1:32:36] that god has a place for us to reach to
[1:32:40] and i believe in that i believe in his
[1:32:42] word i believe what it tells me about me
[1:32:44] it says you're the sinless spotless
[1:32:47] bride of jesus christ i believe all of
[1:32:49] this
[1:32:52] let me read some brother branham quotes
[1:32:54] because
[1:32:55] i don't want people to get nervous i
[1:32:57] only read from the bible this whole time
[1:32:59] uh let's see what here is now elijah
[1:33:02] 1959
[1:33:05] wait uh yeah let's read that one he says
[1:33:08] i went
[1:33:08] oh dear it says he says i want to tell
[1:33:12] you what happened in closing
[1:33:14] i've never said what happened he's
[1:33:16] testifying
[1:33:18] and he's going to tell you why he's
[1:33:19] testifying like this he says i don't
[1:33:21] want to say
[1:33:22] it i won't say it because satan can't
[1:33:25] get it as long as it's in my heart
[1:33:27] god lives there but if i speak it he
[1:33:30] will hear it and he will block every
[1:33:31] road
[1:33:32] got to realize satan's not all that
[1:33:34] powerful
[1:33:35] this quote tells me look satan can't
[1:33:38] read your mind he doesn't know what your
[1:33:39] next steps going to be
[1:33:41] he's going to notice that you came here
[1:33:42] and you heard the word but he doesn't
[1:33:43] know what you're going to do with it
[1:33:45] so he's going to throw everything he has
[1:33:47] at you because you don't know doesn't
[1:33:48] know if you're going to accept it
[1:33:50] or deny it he's going to try to block it
[1:33:52] from getting into your heart
[1:33:53] he's going to block you from receiving
[1:33:55] it just open your heart to what god has
[1:33:57] not because i'm talking i'm not saying
[1:33:58] listen to me i'm saying listen to what
[1:34:01] god is saying maybe it's not your
[1:34:03] favorite way to hear it in a sermon or
[1:34:05] anything like that but just
[1:34:06] try to try to receive it just open your
[1:34:09] heart
[1:34:10] whatever god's leading you to do just do
[1:34:11] it take his
[1:34:13] take his will i'll finish it off with
[1:34:15] the church age book
[1:34:18] revelation section it says it exposes
[1:34:21] satan he's talking about his word
[1:34:23] says it exposes satan revealing his
[1:34:26] works
[1:34:28] the attempted destruction of god's
[1:34:29] people and the discrediting of god's
[1:34:31] word right down to the time he is cast
[1:34:33] into the lake of fire he fights that
[1:34:35] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:34:37] people
[1:34:38] get the true revelation of the true
[1:34:40] church and what she is
[1:34:41] what she stands for and that she can do
[1:34:44] the greater work she will be
[1:34:45] an invincible army he knows what you're
[1:34:48] going to be
[1:34:48] if you accept god's word musicians can
[1:34:51] come back
[1:34:52] i thank you for listening to me today
[1:34:57] i thank god for putting this on my heart
[1:35:00] i mean i couldn't have come up with this
[1:35:01] myself i was just
[1:35:03] my mind was blown just looking at what
[1:35:05] god
[1:35:07] what god can show you if you open your
[1:35:09] mind to it your heart to it to receive
[1:35:12] just seeing that the devil he he's just
[1:35:14] got a bag of tricks and he's not that
[1:35:17] he's not powerful at all all he can do
[1:35:19] is lie to you that's his only power it's
[1:35:21] just lying
[1:35:23] and you can accept it every night

[1:39:10] true
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:18] big trees
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:32] amen we truly thank god for the grace of
[1:39:34] god
[1:39:35] we appreciate our brother aaron amen and
[1:39:39] uh brother caleb i didn't call your name
[1:39:41] because when i got up here i'd forgotten
[1:39:43] it
[1:39:44] but i truly enjoyed both of those songs
[1:39:46] in which you sang
[1:39:48] uh we appreciate everything that god has
[1:39:50] done today and i trust that the
[1:39:53] young people got the understanding of
[1:39:55] what was being said
[1:39:57] um and and so bringing out the way
[1:40:01] satan's uh where in satan's way of
[1:40:04] thinking
[1:40:06] i believe god was just basically trying
[1:40:08] to point out
[1:40:09] to you that you should be careful on how
[1:40:11] you're thinking
[1:40:13] because we want the mind of christ in us
[1:40:17] and we want to think in the way that god
[1:40:19] wants us to think
[1:40:21] satan in the way he thinks always
[1:40:24] benefits
[1:40:25] him he sees something out of it that he
[1:40:28] can get if he could
[1:40:30] if if his way of of thinking is correct
[1:40:33] we we know that satan don't all don't
[1:40:36] always tell lies
[1:40:38] sometimes he tells the truth but in
[1:40:41] telling that truth he has something to
[1:40:43] benefit from it
[1:40:45] and one thing for certain when we um
[1:40:50] we are servants of the lord brother
[1:40:52] branham talks about this and tell us
[1:40:54] about the message and calls us a special
[1:40:56] class of people
[1:40:58] and as our brother aaron ended the
[1:41:00] message today
[1:41:01] he basically tried to tell you that you
[1:41:03] are
[1:41:05] everything god says that you are you
[1:41:08] should never be little yourself
[1:41:09] you should never think that you're less
[1:41:12] some of the things that we have to
[1:41:13] suffer and go through
[1:41:16] in this life has been ordained by god
[1:41:19] but understand you that those people
[1:41:21] those things that we go through
[1:41:22] makes us special in the eyes of god
[1:41:27] and so i want to say by god's grace that
[1:41:29] i truly
[1:41:30] enjoyed the word but i want to always
[1:41:32] encourage this
[1:41:33] young brother i don't know how old you
[1:41:35] are but i want to encourage you that
[1:41:38] whenever you go to preach wherever you
[1:41:41] go to preach
[1:41:42] just be mindful that
[1:41:46] you don't have to care about what the
[1:41:47] people think
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:52] keep your eyes on jesus and if you know
[1:41:54] god has given you a message
[1:41:57] you just give it the way he gives it you
[1:42:00] don't have
[1:42:00] you know what i'm saying i'm just
[1:42:01] encouraging you because i've been there
[1:42:04] sometimes you want to preach and you
[1:42:05] also want to want the people
[1:42:07] to accept it but some messages are not
[1:42:09] going to be accepted
[1:42:11] but as long as you know god gave it to
[1:42:13] you
[1:42:15] you only have the one one thing that you
[1:42:17] need to do is to preach it the way he
[1:42:18] wants you to preach it
[1:42:20] let it fall well it falls you know as
[1:42:23] long as you please the one in the
[1:42:24] balcony that's fine the way i
[1:42:26] like so i enjoyed it praise the lord i
[1:42:29] was listening intensely
[1:42:31] you know because i our brother was
[1:42:34] really uh
[1:42:35] trying to show you how god is really
[1:42:39] trying to deal with us and as young
[1:42:41] people you gotta have the holy ghost
[1:42:43] there's no way that you can have the
[1:42:45] mind of god satan will
[1:42:47] do you every time with his logic and his
[1:42:50] reasoning
[1:42:51] if you don't know the will of god and
[1:42:54] that was the reason why uh
[1:42:56] and i'm not preaching i'm just saying
[1:42:58] it's just just uh
[1:42:59] when um when when jesus knowing the will
[1:43:03] of god
[1:43:05] knew that satan's interpretation of the
[1:43:07] word
[1:43:08] was not correct and that's the only way
[1:43:10] that you're going to know the will of
[1:43:12] god
[1:43:13] when satan's satan will bring the word
[1:43:14] to you sometimes but you got to know the
[1:43:16] day
[1:43:17] you got to know the placing of the word
[1:43:18] you got to know the hour that you're
[1:43:20] living in
[1:43:21] you got to know what god is doing for
[1:43:22] you in that day
[1:43:24] so i trusted you was blessed today i was
[1:43:26] blessed
[1:43:27] because it just added another dimension
[1:43:30] to in the way i think or
[1:43:31] the way i see satan moving
[1:43:36] i mean so we trust that the lord blessed
[1:43:38] each and every one of you
[1:43:40] um i trust i won't be here sunday
[1:43:42] morning brother
[1:43:43] but there'll be a lot more people here
[1:43:45] than than they are
[1:43:47] today and uh just let go and let god
[1:43:52] because i tell you what i people don't
[1:43:54] understand how difficult it is to be a
[1:43:56] preacher
[1:43:59] sometimes i'm churning so bad on the
[1:44:01] inside i don't even know how i live or
[1:44:02] stand
[1:44:04] because my nerves are so wrecked and
[1:44:06] this is all the time
[1:44:07] it never stops some days it's worse than
[1:44:10] others
[1:44:11] but uh i do understand i do understand
[1:44:14] like i said you know you're coming to a
[1:44:16] new place you know
[1:44:18] but that was good don't get me wrong i'm
[1:44:20] not saying it wasn't i'm saying i enjoy
[1:44:22] what god had to say but i want you to be
[1:44:25] encouraging
[1:44:26] and i want you to know that
[1:44:30] you're looking at the man in the balcony
[1:44:33] that's all that matters
[1:44:35] you're looking at him to see whether he
[1:44:36] nods or not
[1:44:38] and as long as he knows yes it's okay
[1:44:40] you're fine
[1:44:42] because sometimes i go to come to preach
[1:44:44] sometime and you don't get no
[1:44:46] no no emotions you know
[1:44:49] people look at you and they stare and
[1:44:51] they don't they you know they
[1:44:52] they don't even holly nod you know
[1:44:58] it's okay because the word is the sword
[1:45:02] the word penetrates even in times we
[1:45:05] don't think it's getting beyond
[1:45:07] it is so we enjoyed you brother we thank
[1:45:10] god for
[1:45:11] all that god has done and we're asking
[1:45:14] our brother
[1:45:15] so i won't talk too much i'm a preacher
[1:45:20] and i'm trying i'm not trying to take
[1:45:22] away i'm trying to add to
[1:45:24] if that you understand what i'm saying
[1:45:26] appreciate what god
[1:45:28] gave you today because this was ordained
[1:45:30] for you
[1:45:32] and i trust that you heard what he said
[1:45:33] today you know if not get the tape and
[1:45:36] go back over it
[1:45:39] amen that was surely a blessing how many
[1:45:41] were blessed this morning
[1:45:44] i really liked the way he was bringing
[1:45:46] out things and saw scriptures
[1:45:48] from another point of view i'd never
[1:45:49] seen before no
[1:45:51] i was i was just thinking the whole
[1:45:54] course of the world was changed
[1:45:56] because eve decided to say the word
[1:45:58] according to satan's point of view
[1:46:00] and everything got transformed
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:05] and this was the devil quoting the word
[1:46:07] to eve
[1:46:09] you know satan is not your friend no
[1:46:12] matter how
[1:46:13] good looking you know how sugarcoated it
[1:46:15] is it's rotten in the middle
[1:46:18] so when satan tries to come to you to
[1:46:20] point you to the word no there's nothing
[1:46:21] good coming out of it
[1:46:23] it's just a is temptation distraction to
[1:46:26] you
[1:46:26] so if the whole course of the world
[1:46:28] could change by
[1:46:30] one person looking at the word at
[1:46:32] satan's point of view
[1:46:34] what more power and what more can you
[1:46:38] and me do
[1:46:39] when we look at the word just like the
[1:46:41] pastor said
[1:46:42] with the mind of christ instead of
[1:46:44] looking at it
[1:46:45] but satan's point of view we look at it
[1:46:47] at god's point of view
[1:46:49] it says let the mind that was in christ
[1:46:51] be in you and then psalm says as a man
[1:46:53] think it in his heart so is he
[1:46:55] so if you start thinking like christ and
[1:46:57] seeing things like christ
[1:46:59] you'll be able to do what he did you'll
[1:47:01] be able to overcome
[1:47:02] overcome satan's way of view
[1:47:05] just like jesus did overcome satan's
[1:47:08] temptation
[1:47:09] the way he tempted jesus to try to turn
[1:47:12] stones into bread
[1:47:13] he overcame that because he kept
[1:47:16] what god was telling him he kept looking
[1:47:18] at the word the way god
[1:47:20] had amen that was just so good i i
[1:47:22] enjoyed it
[1:47:24] i mean god bless you brother aaron thank
[1:47:26] you so much driving all the way nine
[1:47:27] hours here
