[11:57] my Lord amen
[11:59] oh well as we stand we're gonna get
[12:01] right on into the Word of God
[12:06] we'll be coming from Romans the eleventh
[12:08] chapter eleven twenty nine to twenty six
[12:23] Romans 11 for the gifts and calling what
[12:33] God are without repentance for gee in
[12:37] time pass have not believed God yet have
[12:42] excuse me yet have now obtained mercy
[12:44] through their unbelief let me do it
[12:48] again for as ye in times past have not
[12:51] believed God yet have now obtained mercy
[12:55] through their unbelief even so have
[13:00] these also now not believe that through
[13:03] your mercy they also may obtain mercy
[13:07] for God have concluded them all in
[13:11] unbelief that he might have mercy upon
[13:13] all oh the depth of riches both of
[13:18] wisdom and knowledge of God how
[13:20] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[13:24] ways past finding out who who have known
[13:28] the mind of the Lord who have been in
[13:31] his counsel or who have first given to
[13:34] him
[13:35] and it shall be recommenced unto him
[13:37] again for him and through him and to him
[13:41] are all things
[13:43] to whom be glory for ever amen
[13:46] one more scripture just a portion of
[13:52] Ephesians the 3rd chapter we read the
[13:55] 17th verse down to the 19 that Christ
[14:05] may dwell in your hearts by faith that
[14:07] ye being rooted and grounded in love may
[14:11] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[14:14] what is the breadth and length and depth
[14:17] and height and to know the love of
[14:20] Christ which passes knowledge that ye
[14:23] might be filled with all the fullness of
[14:27] God let us pray father we come before
[14:30] you and we thank you for being so good
[14:33] to us we thank you for everything you
[14:36] have done for us we pray father that
[14:39] your perfect will be done this evening
[14:41] father bless us as you blessed us this
[14:44] morning our cups Lord is empty open and
[14:48] ready to be filled anoint us Lord and
[14:51] your name Jesus Christ and give us
[14:53] hearts to receive your word in your
[14:55] lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[14:58] you may be seated on this morning we
[15:02] left off with the the ugly mule and we
[15:05] talked about - how vast God is the
[15:09] scripture tells us that the ways of the
[15:11] Lord are past finding out the only way
[15:14] that you can understand God is by
[15:16] revelation you can study this Bible from
[15:19] cover to cover
[15:20] you can put line upon line and precept
[15:23] upon precept but until God unveil it to
[15:26] you in - God reveals it to you you will
[15:29] never understand it the Bible tells us
[15:32] also that the carnal mind cannot
[15:34] understand those things that be of God
[15:36] so therefore in order to understand God
[15:39] you need the Spirit of God to fully
[15:41] understand him if God should give you a
[15:44] revelation and sometimes he does give
[15:47] people revelation
[15:49] have not yet been baptized with the holy
[15:51] ghost but he will give them revelation
[15:54] he gave Peter revelation and Peter had
[15:57] not yet been baptized with the holy
[15:59] ghost but Peter understood who Jesus
[16:01] Christ was so God's ways are past
[16:05] finding out there are those who were
[16:07] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[16:09] Christ and they got the Holy Ghost or
[16:12] received the Holy Ghost and then there
[16:14] are those a man who had not yet been
[16:17] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[16:19] received the Holy Ghost before they got
[16:21] baptized so who's going to determine
[16:24] whether it's right to get it before or
[16:26] after God is the one who gives out the
[16:29] Holy Spirit is that right the Bible
[16:32] tells us that we're just one body with
[16:34] one body baptized into one spirit amen
[16:37] by the grace of God but we are here by
[16:40] the grace of God to understand what God
[16:44] is doing see we came in here amen
[16:48] because of the fall we came in here in a
[16:51] state of amnesia didn't know who God
[16:53] don't didn't know God didn't know who we
[16:55] were didn't know where we were going and
[16:57] where we were coming from but now that
[17:00] we have received the Holy Spirit God has
[17:03] given us the grace His grace so that we
[17:07] can come to a place to so we can
[17:09] comprehend get an understanding of what
[17:12] the depth the length of the height the
[17:15] breadth you know have some kind of
[17:18] understanding who God is we do know that
[17:21] God is our Father and we know by God's
[17:24] grace that we cannot amen be God's
[17:29] children unless we are full of the Holy
[17:32] Ghost the saddest part about this whole
[17:35] thing is is that when we came into this
[17:38] life or into this dimension you and I
[17:42] came into this dimension amen blind we
[17:46] could not see we were sinners shaken
[17:50] iniquities but we were all a part of
[17:53] God's plan when I think about how God
[17:56] said unto Abraham Abraham do you see the
[17:58] dust of the earth so will your children
[18:01] be now you got to understand
[18:03] that's a lot of faith there know that a
[18:06] man and a woman who cannot even have
[18:08] children not even one at the time God
[18:11] looks at the star the dirt of the earth
[18:13] and says now if you can count the sand
[18:15] grains of saying this is how many how
[18:17] your children is gonna be and he goes on
[18:20] says now if you can concoct the Stars
[18:22] hallelujah all of these stars are
[18:24] representing your offspring now that is
[18:28] faith but if Abraham could stand as a
[18:32] witness today he can truly say God has
[18:35] been faithful a man because since God
[18:38] gave him the promise God produced gave
[18:42] him a son and now because of that son
[18:45] amen the whole world has been blessed
[18:48] below both Jews and Gentiles is that
[18:52] right let me say like this because
[18:54] sometimes we don't realize Amen that
[18:56] everything that we do is record it
[18:59] that's why we need to blood the blood of
[19:03] Jesus Christ is the only one that can
[19:05] wash it whiter than snow look what he
[19:08] says Amen in Christ and revealed in his
[19:10] own word he said you're going to find
[19:13] out one of these days that when you go
[19:17] to heaven you don't fly off somewhere
[19:20] else you're still right here - just in
[19:25] another dimension faster than this right
[19:32] through this room is coming colors every
[19:35] color shirt dress whatever you got on is
[19:39] eternal laying right on records going
[19:43] around and around the world every time
[19:46] you bat your eyes it's right on record
[19:49] watch television will prove that that is
[19:53] so true right now
[19:54] Amen Marilyn Monroe been dead for so
[19:56] many years but you can still find her on
[19:59] record you can still see her in the
[20:02] movies and Elvis Presley been dead for
[20:05] years you can still hear his voice you
[20:07] can still see his face you can still see
[20:10] all the dirty did why because it's a
[20:13] record
[20:13] and God said just as those things are
[20:17] on the record of man God keeps record as
[20:20] well is that right so no man will be
[20:23] able to say what Lord I didn't do it cuz
[20:26] God and the day of judgment if you're
[20:28] not a Christian will flash it up right
[20:30] there and everybody will see every dirt
[20:33] everything you ever did that's why the
[20:36] blood of Jesus Christ if you need a
[20:38] hiding place that's where you go hide
[20:40] see God is amazing
[20:42] a man no man no man every man that faces
[20:47] God as a sinner has faced God as a
[20:50] sinner because it's been his choice
[20:52] hallelujah because God cannot judge a
[20:55] man if he'd ever gave him an opportunity
[20:57] to be saying but every man is judged by
[21:03] their own choices is that right
[21:08] hallelujah since when you were born God
[21:12] sets a record on it don't see put a
[21:16] record on it don't make much noise for a
[21:19] little while and that's a truth he said
[21:22] that's when you're a baby and you're not
[21:25] accountable for your sin that's the
[21:28] silent part that's little baby till it
[21:35] comes to accountability then the noise
[21:38] starts he starts saying things and doing
[21:41] things that he has an answer for and
[21:43] then when that life is that record or
[21:46] tape is took off and laid in the great
[21:49] big library of God now how you're going
[21:53] to get away get around it at the
[21:55] judgment bar it plays right back in
[21:58] front of you every move you made every
[22:01] thought went through your mind can you
[22:04] see that now can you see where God is
[22:08] see you got to realize Amen that God is
[22:11] like not like us he can never forget the
[22:15] only thing that makes God forget is his
[22:17] blood hey man when God forgot is because
[22:21] he you have given your life and your
[22:23] sins to him and he throws it in the sea
[22:25] of forgetfulness and God can no longer
[22:27] remember your sins
[22:30] and I guarantee you there's everyone
[22:33] everybody in here won't want God to
[22:35] forget some things don't we hallelujah
[22:39] but God is vast god is great God is in
[22:43] all in above all I see him in the stars
[22:47] I see him in the Sun I see him in the
[22:50] moon I see him in the trees he was well
[22:53] I I don't believe in God cuz I cuz I
[22:56] can't not see him well you don't believe
[22:58] in the air you breathe because you
[23:00] cannot see the air in which you breathe
[23:03] but those trees will move to indicate
[23:07] that God if there's a wind somewhere ha
[23:10] ha hallelujah and we we don't even know
[23:14] we don't know the last breath we take
[23:16] but did you know that God has already
[23:19] said and numbered the breaths that
[23:21] you're going to take it keeps a well you
[23:24] know our science have gotten so great
[23:27] too we can extend man's life that's a
[23:29] lie no man can know science can extend
[23:34] man's life the Bible said God has no
[23:37] beginning and ending when God gets ready
[23:41] for you I don't care from standing in
[23:43] the pulpit like me if God calls my car
[23:45] like a drop right now
[23:46] you don't even have to be sick it's when
[23:50] your number is called when your days are
[23:53] over and like I said it meant James shed
[23:56] is like a vapor it's such a short time
[23:58] you and I we were looking at Esther's
[24:02] pictures the other day and in how she
[24:04] was when she was small and how she's
[24:07] grown up now amen but you know it has
[24:10] happened so quickly I remember when we
[24:13] were changing Christopher I mean when he
[24:15] was a baby hey man and look how grown
[24:17] and tall he is now you see it doesn't
[24:20] take long it happens right in the face
[24:22] you know and you say well brother listen
[24:25] I can remember when I used when I first
[24:27] came the line by Iowa I was running
[24:29] eight miles a day 4:00 in the morning
[24:31] and 4:00 in the evening let me try it
[24:33] now I can't even run on eight eight
[24:36] corners almost but nevertheless it just
[24:40] shows you how time
[24:43] so quickly and so fast right now you
[24:47] said what what do you mean Brotherhood's
[24:49] this is this time I'm not talking about
[24:51] eternity this is just this little little
[24:55] I mean even even even when it came to
[24:58] the time you know James didn't know how
[25:01] to talk to say it it were the fastest
[25:04] thing I ever seen
[25:05] coming or was a vapor hallelujah it
[25:09] moves so quickly through came here we go
[25:11] it's gone amen
[25:14] but see even in that short period of
[25:17] time God keeps account of everything we
[25:20] do and say the saddest thing is as we
[25:25] said we have moved into a world where
[25:28] God has blinded the minds of the people
[25:31] see they have eyes to see but they can't
[25:35] see right they have eyes they maybe even
[25:39] even when Jesus Christ came on the scene
[25:42] the Jew was so blinded they did not even
[25:45] recognize their Messiah hmm and God
[25:49] could be standing right here or sitting
[25:51] right there by somebody and you'll never
[25:53] know it except you be spiritual God
[25:57] comes in the church and somehow they
[25:59] come in the church and then hear the
[26:00] Word of God they leave out here excited
[26:03] and then the another person to come out
[26:05] come out says well you know I found it
[26:07] was quite boring I didn't get nothing
[26:09] see is the mindset is when you come with
[26:13] the right mindset is when God can feed
[26:16] you hallelujah
[26:18] see the Bible said if our gospel be hid
[26:22] it is hid to them that are lost in whom
[26:25] the god of this world has blinded the
[26:28] minds of them which believe not is that
[26:31] right and that's what it is
[26:33] I mean psychology and all of these
[26:37] reasonings that people reason God out
[26:40] because they don't think it ought to be
[26:41] a certain way they feel that God going
[26:44] to change the book for them God won't
[26:46] change the book for himself not one word
[26:50] will fall to the ground everything that
[26:53] God has promised will be callaloo
[26:56] and guess what he's big enough to do it
[26:58] I don't think nobody in here can stand
[27:02] before God and tell him that he ain't
[27:04] gonna do it
[27:05] help us Jesus for we preach not
[27:09] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[27:13] ourselves your servants for Jesus sake
[27:16] for God who commanded the light to shine
[27:19] out of darkness have shined in our
[27:21] hearts to give the light of the
[27:23] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[27:25] face of Jesus Christ something came to
[27:27] me just now and I'm sure every one of us
[27:29] probably have experienced this and I
[27:31] don't know really they used to know the
[27:33] old folks says you know the witch was
[27:34] riding you last night it's when you try
[27:37] to get up and you can't get up when you
[27:41] try to wake up and you can't wake up but
[27:43] you know that ain't God that's doing it
[27:45] you having a bad dream and you need to
[27:48] call on Jesus and you can't get him out
[27:49] your mouth you can't get your mouth all
[27:53] you can just feel like yourself you just
[27:54] screaming in Holland and nobody can hear
[27:57] you
[27:57] that ought to wake people up it ought to
[28:01] make them see they're not in control of
[28:03] their lives and sometimes God puts a
[28:06] demon on you just to show you you are
[28:09] that you do not have the power over your
[28:11] flesh hallelujah and there are times the
[28:15] only way I could get out of it was to
[28:17] call on Jesus and I had to work at it
[28:23] when we see how good god has been to us
[28:27] we need to see show how God you know you
[28:31] got to understand there was a reason why
[28:33] God had Israel here as I said this
[28:35] morning
[28:36] no man have seen God at any time but
[28:38] when God wants to be seen he occupies a
[28:42] flesh body he shows a many people and so
[28:47] when God comes to occupy to show himself
[28:50] he comes down and such a are you aware
[28:56] of humility and put it this way look at
[28:59] God comes and we just so-called
[29:01] celebrated Christmas but my thing is God
[29:03] could have been born in a mansion but
[29:06] God came down and was born in a manger
[29:10] and I understand that that manger was a
[29:12] was a cave a little place where you know
[29:16] not not like they have it in the movies
[29:18] but a cave opening in the cave in the
[29:21] rock I like that part where they kept
[29:24] the sheeps and goats and whatever the
[29:27] ball they fed them there they kept them
[29:29] there and they slept in there you know
[29:31] some of them so you look at this thing
[29:33] you said well why did God do that
[29:35] because he wanted to let people know
[29:37] though he was God he knew how to Humble
[29:40] himself he was he wanted them to know
[29:43] that listen I want to be a known and I
[29:48] want to be understood
[29:50] amen that that I can I want to be I can
[29:54] touch the feelings or can be touched by
[29:56] the feelings of the infirmities of even
[30:00] the poor people I'm so glad everybody's
[30:03] so excited tonight smiles and
[30:06] hallelujahs and praises to God I can't
[30:09] hardly stand it up here whoo hallelujah
[30:14] but listen the the Bible tells us that
[30:18] people don't be selfish people are going
[30:20] to be you know you know they pay all
[30:22] about themselves and you know even when
[30:25] it comes to God they don't feel like it
[30:29] you know they have to do this you see
[30:32] but the Bible says this know also that
[30:35] in the last days perilous times shall
[30:38] come first men shall be lovers of their
[30:42] own selves I don't feel like doing it
[30:45] lovers have their own self I don't think
[30:48] it's necessary lovers of their own
[30:50] selves covetous boasters proud
[30:54] blasphemers disobedient to parents world
[30:58] that's a big one I'm thankful unholy
[31:05] without natural affection trucebreakers
[31:09] you know what those breakers are those
[31:12] who break the peace hmm those who feel
[31:17] like is okay Amen to fuss and fight and
[31:20] carry oh oh
[31:21] bradwick brothers when you know
[31:23] made peace would you stir it all up
[31:25] again trucebreakers I looked it up I'm
[31:28] like I thought I knew what to speak as
[31:30] well till I looked it up this evening
[31:33] you don't call a truce you don't call
[31:36] for peace and then here come here come
[31:39] again stirring the pot all over again
[31:41] God said that's bad hallelujah lovers of
[31:46] pleasures more than lovers of god having
[31:48] a form of godliness and i was hitting
[31:51] that today that's what having a form of
[31:54] godliness is looking like you got the
[31:56] Holy Ghost and you don't hallelujah
[32:00] but denying the power thereof I want it
[32:03] but I don't want to get it like that hmm
[32:07] from such turn away ooh
[32:11] but you and I must realize that the vast
[32:14] is oh I can't understand this I think
[32:17] about it all the time the scripture says
[32:20] no man can add a cubit to his statue you
[32:24] can't do it I can't do it only God can
[32:28] do it but one thing for certain we have
[32:31] an assurance that God knew us from the
[32:35] foundation of the world and we were in
[32:38] the mind of God and so therefore being
[32:41] in the mind of God even we can rest
[32:44] assure that whatever God has determined
[32:48] for me is for me whatever God has
[32:52] determined for you is for you hallelujah
[32:55] and no matter what Satan tries to stop
[32:58] you oh my god is the truth think about
[33:01] the woman a man at Jericho who was a
[33:03] prostitute all her life but in the mind
[33:07] of God she was a daughter of God and yet
[33:10] she didn't know it hallelujah and yet
[33:13] God took a whole millions of people out
[33:17] of Egypt traveled them through the
[33:19] wilderness for 40 years until Rahab
[33:22] became an adult terrain became up for a
[33:26] person Amen that that could respond to
[33:28] the gospel and when God saw Amen Rahab
[33:32] was ready God told Joshua it's time to
[33:35] cross
[33:36] time to cross over I've got a seat over
[33:39] there see no matter what she looked like
[33:42] to the public in the mind of God she was
[33:45] a daughter of God that's what I'm
[33:47] talking about it doesn't matter what
[33:50] what family you born in coming to this
[33:55] well the way we do people are evil
[33:58] people do evil things and your parents
[34:02] amen though you were born a man this
[34:04] he's excused there's nobody who I know
[34:07] of that was born into a good family

[34:13] God hallelujah it doesn't matter who's a
[34:17] prostitute a whoremonger whatever god
[34:24] don't look at that God looks at once he
[34:27] put there in you before the foundation
[34:30] of the world
[34:32] hallelujah if the soil is not the thing
[34:41] is to see you said what do you mean look
[34:48] at brother Adam he comes in there his
[34:51] daddy's an alcoholic

[34:57] Indian you know a man he's about her
[35:02] being a come on somebody it's the
[35:05] truth
[35:06] hallelujah he had a bet his family had a
[35:09] bad reputation but it wasn't that that's
[35:12] not what God was looking at surely he
[35:14] was born in a manger he was born in a
[35:17] mess hallelujah but God saw who we were
[35:21] even at the day of his birth the pillar
[35:24] fire come down and swept to in the
[35:26] window hallelujah

[36:19] what I wish I could preach this message
[36:21] like God showed me on my bed hallelujah

[36:26] share but if you can see what I'm trying
[36:28] to say that even though we we look at
[36:31] these chairs and these chairs one time
[36:33] they the wood chairs anyway used to be
[36:37] he was alive hmm but you know every tree
[36:42] is not made into a chair just like every
[36:46] or every little metal amen every piece
[36:49] of that metal was ordained to be in that
[36:51] particular chair right there we never
[36:53] think about it every screw everything
[36:56] that's been made to form that chair God
[36:58] saw that now tell me if that's not
[37:01] brilliant he saw that one day we would
[37:05] go worship in this church and we would
[37:07] have all kinds of colors in here of
[37:10] chairs
[37:12] he saw that hallelujah he saw exactly
[37:16] where we're sitting he saw everything it
[37:19] nothing surprises God that's just that's
[37:25] just so mine he knows the battles he
[37:27] knows every demon every devil we have to
[37:29] deal with and he's willing and willing
[37:32] to get rid of all of him

[38:46] I preached but he's he's all hallelujah
[38:50] and everything that was created was
[38:52] created in him because there's nothing
[38:54] on the outside of him he feels every
[38:57] crack every corner he feels all and in
[39:00] all who had measured the waters in the
[39:05] hollow of his hand and meted out heaven
[39:07] with the span and comprehended the dust
[39:10] of the earth in a measure and weigh the
[39:12] mountain and scale in his heels in a
[39:15] balance who have directed the Spirit of
[39:18] the Lord or being his counselor have
[39:21] taught him
[39:22] anybody can anybody tell me that you can
[39:25] teach God hallelujah
[39:27] yeah God has said had you in his mind he
[39:31] saw you there hallelujah that's just how
[39:34] vast he is that's how people talk about
[39:37] the depths of God the depths of God can
[39:40] only be found in the love of God hello
[39:43] yeah because God is love when you began
[39:47] to love like you are - that's when God
[39:49] began to break the word he began to
[39:52] share things with you that he won't
[39:53] share with anybody else
[39:55] but because it's a love affair his love
[39:58] Plus love equals love hallelujah
[40:01] when God can trust you he can show you
[40:03] things that he can't show anyone else is
[40:07] that right
[40:07] oh yeah Paul loved God so much that he
[40:11] was willing to love God he died three
[40:13] times he was shipwrecked beaten so many
[40:15] times he loved God and guess what
[40:17] but he even counted joy is that right
[40:22] kind of joy right when you fall into
[40:26] divers temptations all those things well
[40:29] says listen I have learned to be a bass
[40:32] I've learned to humble myself hallelujah
[40:36] Paul says listen I've seen I've had all
[40:39] kinds of experiences but in all of my
[40:42] experiences the thing I want people to
[40:44] see is Christ in me not a hard to live
[40:47] but Christ lives in me whatever I do I
[40:50] want them to see Jesus not me
[40:53] Paul said is not hard that live but
[40:56] Christ that lives in me if the people
[40:58] could see that see you and I can't
[41:03] expect to stay in the King's Chamber
[41:06] acting like Vesta or vasty no sure yeah
[41:11] man Vashti was she she was arrogant she
[41:13] was prideful she was Queen she had a she

[41:36] people Amen whoo oh I'm in the message

[41:45] bride brother well said God that that

[41:56] barefooted poor looking girl Amen who
[42:00] cares nothing about the well but she's
[42:02] got that's what God is looking for he's
[42:07] looking for character he's searching for
[42:11] somebody that's going to worship Him in
[42:13] spirit and in truth
[42:15] hallelujah he's looking for somebody
[42:17] that's compatible miss Jesus Christ who
[42:22] can produce the same kind of love oh
[42:26] that's what he said the prophet of God
[42:28] said we must pray
[42:30] that we're not from satan's either hmm
[42:35] with who Tukey counselor and who shall
[42:38] instruct him and taught him in the path
[42:42] of judgment and taught him knowledge and

[42:50] hallelujah what's that man that genius
[42:53] that died not too long ago a man that
[42:55] almost became a computer himself what
[42:58] was his name but my point but poor

[43:03] how smart he was he had to die and if he
[43:08] didn't know Jesus Christ with all that
[43:10] education

[43:17] what give me let me be a dummy if I
[43:19] gotta be a dummy to get to hell and let
[43:21] me be a dummy because what all what did
[43:24] that do for him
[43:25] Oh people can brag on him in this
[43:28] dimension but in the dimension he's in
[43:30] he wish he could come back one more time
[43:34] hallelujah and do it all over again mmm
[43:40] she Paul says listen up I understand
[43:43] things about this way like I said see
[43:47] that's what people don't understand they
[43:49] look at their flesh and they think that
[43:50] flesh can be saved your flesh won't be
[43:52] save until Jesus quicken it that old
[43:55] little devil gonna be hanging on you
[43:57] until you die or to Jesus rapture you

[44:18] which is it with your him where the
[44:20] worms never die fool can you imagine
[44:24] hallelujah
[44:25] think about it ooh so you and I must
[44:28] understand Paul says listen I sure God
[44:31] there are times at times I want to do
[44:34] good and that don't do it I mean the
[44:37] time when I whenever I don't want to do
[44:40] bad I end up doing bad you
[44:43] there's two laws there but they call for
[44:46] the law of grace he said that two laws
[44:49] then he said there's a law in my member
[44:52] and there's a law on the inside that
[44:55] inside law is how I serve God that's why
[45:00] I needed the Holy Ghost
[45:02] I needed a king on the inside of my
[45:05] heart
[45:06] hallelujah I needed to become a kingdom
[45:08] hallelujah within the kingdom hallelujah
[45:12] I needed a meant something on the inside
[45:15] that can cause me to worship God in
[45:17] spirit and in truth I can't do it as a
[45:20] natural man because my natural man is
[45:23] carnal
[45:25] don't you know God knew that he knew
[45:30] Jeremiah was gonna get frustrated
[45:32] Jeremiah said God you tricked me
[45:35] you don't trick me LaHood you told me I
[45:38] was going to be this and that you told
[45:40] me I preach you told me you called me
[45:43] before I was in my mother's womb you
[45:45] fashioned me Lord but you never told me
[45:47] they were gonna beat me up they're gonna
[45:51] reject me the way they did you didn't
[45:53] show me how I was gonna suffer for your
[45:55] namesake let me tell you something when
[45:58] you are true living son or daughter of
[46:00] God you gonna suffer for the namesake of
[46:02] Jesus ha
[46:03] cuz God gonna make it happen did you
[46:06] know that brother BAM said God loves to
[46:08] lead us into traps he loves to read lead
[46:13] us in the traps why because he want to
[46:15] see how you going to come up out of it
[46:17] he know you will it doesn't matter how
[46:21] big the stone that day the devil don't
[46:23] roll over the tomb God says hey you roll
[46:27] it away hallelujah you will see a
[46:30] resurrection boom and every man and
[46:33] woman has the faith to roll that stone
[46:36] of unbelief away I don't care louder
[46:38] here he said I didn't like this all my
[46:41] life
[46:41] roll away the stone ask God for the
[46:44] faith to roll away the stone think about
[46:47] it you think those few women amen could
[46:49] have just roll that stone by themselves
[46:51] Marion loved to roll away that stone a
[46:54] stone that would perhaps a ton of more
[46:57] know how heavy it was but I've been
[46:59] there and the stone is no way you can
[47:01] weigh it on the scale it was very big
[47:02] round stone roll away the stone the
[47:06] Bible didn't say they had no help it
[47:08] took faith Rollo for to win the roll
[47:13] even that they were big strong women but
[47:15] all I can tell you that you know it was
[47:17] it was so big that even the Roman
[47:19] soldiers couldn't easily roll it away
[47:21] but they rolled away to stone why
[47:24] because jesus said if you do that you'll
[47:28] see the resurrection hallelujah
[47:30] not in the future now hallelujah and
[47:34] that's why God allows certain things too
[47:36] late in our lives things that are just
[47:39] just keep us in the tube hallelujah keep
[47:42] us in a bad position but God says I have
[47:45] given you the faith to do it if you can
[47:48] realize I'm the creator of all these
[47:50] things and is there anything too hard
[47:52] for God if you can see that I'm the one
[47:56] and all you have to do is trust me and I
[47:59] will give to you your heart's desire
[48:01] that's the truth it's the truth right
[48:05] for now being is no more that I do it
[48:08] that's what Paul said but sin that
[48:10] dwelleth in me but I know that in me
[48:13] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[48:15] thing don't trust it don't you even
[48:20] trust it for to will is present it's
[48:23] present with me but now how to perform
[48:26] that which is good I find not now Paul
[48:30] who is a prophet is telling me he had
[48:33] trouble in his flesh hello Paul is
[48:37] telling me he failed God at times Oh a
[48:44] prophet you know I don't quote this so
[48:50] many time but remember brother Branham
[48:51] God told brother Branham if you don't
[48:53] move when that man come there cut that
[48:56] tree down you gonna beat him up and God
[48:59] gave him a vision folks that means it
[49:03] was in process that means it was going
[49:06] to happen that wasn't just a dream that
[49:09] was a vision and brothers
[49:11] hitting a man hitting and kicking down
[49:13] the heel and everything and the Holy
[49:14] Ghost says if you don't move this is
[49:16] just what you're gonna be doing hello I
[49:20] profit but you and I must realize amen
[49:24] if God don't keep you he is a keeper
[49:28] that's why I said grieve not the Holy
[49:31] Ghost you can have the Holy Ghost and
[49:33] still do wrong things they don't grieve
[49:36] it God is the keeper of the house
[49:41] hallelujah oh you sure wanna be we
[49:45] remember when God told brother Branham
[49:47] don't smoke he was getting pressure from
[49:49] and dad him to drink in his in women's
[49:52] and smoke and he said every time he
[49:54] tried to do that those go yeah happen
[49:58] that was enough for me right there I
[50:02] wouldn't come for a second hallelujah I
[50:05] would have been running Lord I'm sorry
[50:07] forgive me I'm sorry y'all understand me
[50:14] you know I'm using this for an example
[50:17] to show you people of God he even had a
[50:20] higher high calling a greater calling in
[50:22] his day than we have in that way you
[50:25] know we're called to be bright which is
[50:27] a higher calling but he was prophet and
[50:29] bride you see what I'm saying so you got
[50:33] to realize by God's grace that the
[50:35] emphasis are given to us now because to
[50:37] whom much is given much is required
[50:39] God don't want church folk God have had
[50:42] church folks for thousands of years you
[50:47] know won't you just a joint church and
[50:49] be something just sitting up in here
[50:50] amen oh praise God I go to church I mean
[50:53] you know that's what you want to sell it
[50:57] for is that what we're gonna be just
[50:59] just to come in here and just warm the
[51:01] chairs up throw this action in Christ
[51:04] there's so much life in Christ and
[51:07] that's what God see God I listened to
[51:10] the message amen God in His Church in
[51:13] God brother I'm saying God love bravery
[51:17] you know I'm no coward he love bravery
[51:20] that struck
[51:24] this morning I'm like we just put
[51:25] another log on my fire hallelujah I find
[51:29] in a law that when I would go do good
[51:31] evil is present with me for I delight in
[51:34] the law of God after the inward man but
[51:38] I see is that right he said but I see
[51:40] another law in my members warring
[51:42] against the law of my mind and bringing
[51:44] me into captivity to the law of sin
[51:46] which is in my members is that right how
[51:49] many times you've gone to church and
[51:50] you've had a wonderful time
[51:52] just the Holy Ghost falling all over you
[51:54] and everything else and just write out
[51:56] the service or something you forgetting
[51:57] something happen to you say Oh Lord the
[51:59] devil say see what you just did ain't
[52:01] nothing he's alive and you you you
[52:04] foolish to believe that huh him and he
[52:09] just told you a lie
[52:10] God God not you will come to you without
[52:14] making a change whenever God comes he
[52:17] makes a change hallelujah now it's up to
[52:20] you to receive the chain but God when he
[52:23] comes he brings a change you just got to
[52:29] have faith to hold fast to that change
[52:31] is that right hallelujah it's just like
[52:35] healing and you know people don't
[52:37] understand healing is something that's
[52:39] great but healing take faith healing can
[52:43] look at this dimension healing is not up
[52:46] this I mentioned healing is a
[52:48] supernatural element of God and in order
[52:51] to handle that you must be on the
[52:52] supernatural mind to handle healing
[52:55] because the devil it'll bring you to
[52:57] smell to see the taste and all the
[52:59] feelings Amen that comes with being sick
[53:02] and everything else and if you it all
[53:04] depends on who which one of those
[53:06] sermons you enjoy the most you enjoy the
[53:11] sermon of God with His stripes I'm
[53:12] healed you heal hallelujah but if you
[53:15] just feel so sick god I'm just dissing
[53:18] oh I see you gonna remain that now I
[53:21] know I've experienced it from experience
[53:23] when you know especially with a headache
[53:25] all my headache is getting worse and
[53:27] when I do that guess what I just cursed
[53:29] myself let me move on people of God so I
[53:35] want you to understand this vastness
[53:37] the depth of existant the depth of
[53:39] existence because you gotta understand
[53:42] you're not just here you just didn't
[53:45] come here to be here and eat our
[53:48] brothers coming from Iowa City
[53:50] y'all just y'all I know y'all let's go
[53:52] let's go to Des Moines but you will
[53:54] understand that still an inspiration and
[53:57] the inspiration comes from God why are
[53:59] you alone and nobody else there's
[54:03] something for you God has something and
[54:07] you got to find out what it is but God
[54:08] has something and when I come when I say
[54:11] these things I don't say it to flatter

[56:20] climbing
[56:21] Ezekiel's ladder did y'all know now we

[56:29] but in the DNA the ladder goes like this
[56:32] like a spiral hmm like a spiral still
[56:40] going up but you got to understand that
[56:45] you know you're going in a circle as you
[56:48] climb and what people don't understand
[56:51] is this when you and I that life that
[56:55] ladder all of that is DNA all that is
[56:58] showing you by God's grace that that God
[57:01] has everything control even in your
[57:03] blood he's already determined what kind
[57:05] of person you're gonna be he understood

[57:22] might see somebody that look really
[57:24] sharp and you think wow what I what that

[57:41] better than me you might have some
[57:43] harmful things going on on the inside
[57:44] y'all know what I'm saying so let's move
[57:48] on by God's grace you know we look at
[57:51] this thing because I'm trying to get us
[57:52] to see that God now listen if God said
[57:56] to brother Isaac if you have the faith
[57:58] to say to this mountain be thou move and
[58:01] believe in your heart

[58:11] grain of sand to a mountain if that dust
[58:16] but in you you have the ability to move
[58:19] that mountain now understand is not by
[58:22] power nor by might but by my spirit say
[58:25] at the law that means that dust that
[58:28] little piece of dust all he has to do is
[58:30] speak and the end and the vastness the
[58:34] depth of God the existence of God will
[58:37] move that for you now Shiva saying it
[58:43] makes God even greater
[58:45] yeahjust it does something and make God
[58:48] so great just to see that God can use me
[58:51] and you to do his work brother I said

[1:00:03] him to go straight you know oh he said
[1:00:05] okay and he said all of a sudden he
[1:00:08] found himself traveling he was in this
[1:00:09] like traveling traveling traveling he
[1:00:12] said then all of a sudden he stopped and
[1:00:13] he was in this light that was so bright
[1:00:14] and he said he heard the voice with
[1:00:18] I can't get his name John I'm gonna say
[1:00:20] John huh what was his name ah Keene

[1:00:44] thought oh he's gonna he's gonna say
[1:00:46] depart from me you work of iniquity he
[1:00:49] said but all of a sudden in the back
[1:00:50] back of me he said I heard the sweetest
[1:00:53] voice sweeter than a mother's voice he's
[1:00:58] a lord John stood for me on earth and
[1:01:06] I'll stand for him now I can't think of
[1:01:13] his name right now
[1:01:14] anybody knows named Daniel Daniel Currie
[1:01:22] that's right amen and my mind was far
[1:01:25] away from Daniel but you know what God
[1:01:28] knew is so he made y'all remember so we
[1:01:33] look at these things and you and I must
[1:01:34] realize that man here was Daniel Currie
[1:01:36] and God blesses this man I wanna shake
[1:01:39] his hand when I get there but you know I
[1:01:42] look at these things I see everything
[1:01:45] you do for Christ will last
[1:01:48] you and I will never old God anything
[1:01:52] and what he doesn't pay you if he
[1:01:56] doesn't pay you here and now he'll pay
[1:01:59] you when you get on the other side in
[1:02:00] that amazing that God is gonna pay you
[1:02:04] for allowing you allowing him to use
[1:02:06] your body he gonna pay you and he's the
[1:02:12] one doing the work he's the one doing
[1:02:19] the work
[1:02:25] Oh Oh merci is this okay now listen
[1:02:34] likewise and this I'm coming to this
[1:02:36] before cold
[1:02:37] he said likewise the spirit also helpeth
[1:02:40] our infirmities for we know not what we
[1:02:44] should pray for as all as we ought but
[1:02:47] the Spirit itself maketh intercession
[1:02:49] for us with groanings which cannot be
[1:02:52] uttered and he that searches the heart
[1:02:55] and knoweth what is in the mind of the
[1:02:58] spirit now understand me now you got the
[1:03:01] Holy Spirit you got God and you got the
[1:03:03] Holy Spirit God steel God right
[1:03:08] he knows the mind of the spirit because
[1:03:11] it's his spirit and he knows the spirit
[1:03:15] you got here didn't didn't brother I'm
[1:03:17] said God God puts a watchman over us he
[1:03:20] puts a person he says it somebody he
[1:03:22] said the Holy Ghost reports back to God
[1:03:27] the Holy Ghost report back to himself
[1:03:29] what's really going on in you and when
[1:03:33] you don't know how to pray the Holy
[1:03:36] Ghost intercedes for you
[1:03:40] this thing is so powerful to me
[1:03:42] because let me say like this remember
[1:03:44] here Peter ordained of God to be the
[1:03:47] preacher on the day of Pentecost tells
[1:03:49] Jesus you're not gone to Calvary and
[1:03:52] Jesus looked beyond Peter and said Satan
[1:03:56] see he was in another dimension
[1:03:58] he knew that wasn't Peter that was
[1:04:01] trying to stop him to go in the Calvary
[1:04:03] knowing that Peter loved him he didn't
[1:04:06] ask Peter Peter do you love me right so
[1:04:08] he knows they meant by God's grace so
[1:04:11] you say well be sometimes even out of
[1:04:13] our own mouth comes negativity doubt and
[1:04:19] unbelief and God to bring a word from
[1:04:22] the preacher then I cut you make it
[1:04:25] right and you say thank you Jesus huh
[1:04:30] it's God it's God hallelujah all right
[1:04:36] I'm at the end of my journey but
[1:04:39] look at these things I want to say this
[1:04:41] when God comes in and he works in your
[1:04:44] behalf which he will always why for whom
[1:04:47] he did foreknow he also did predestinate
[1:04:50] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:04:54] so if he knew you he he you already been
[1:05:00] predestinated to do what be conformed
[1:05:03] and don't you know when god conforms you
[1:05:07] or transform you there's always a lot of
[1:05:10] pain hello you can't be a Christian
[1:05:15] without paying folks you cannot be a
[1:05:17] Christian without rejection people gonna
[1:05:20] reject you you cannot be a Christian
[1:05:23] a man without battling and having fights
[1:05:26] is that right the only way you can be a
[1:05:30] you gotta suffer hmm and when I'm gonna
[1:05:34] tell you like this
[1:05:34] let me put it this way when would you
[1:05:36] rather suffer now or later
[1:05:39] you know everybody's a little slow now I
[1:05:44] didn't have the thing I knew who
[1:05:46] listened give me my suffering now
[1:05:49] whatever I got to do because I realized
[1:05:52] I'm not something for evil I'm suffering
[1:05:54] for good God is moving the evil out of
[1:05:57] me all right everything you go through
[1:06:01] it is listen
[1:06:02] cashing out devils it's not always
[1:06:04] laying their hands some Devils leave
[1:06:08] because you refuse to do what they want
[1:06:11] you to do right it's the truth
[1:06:16] y'all remember y'all remember our what
[1:06:19] was his name I can't think of his name
[1:06:20] right now brother jewel fawning your
[1:06:23] father said he got his mom a whip tell
[1:06:24] my mom and dad I don't know which one it
[1:06:26] was
[1:06:26] whipped him so good he didn't ever tell
[1:06:30] he'd never told us what he did he said
[1:06:32] hit but they whipped him they beat him
[1:06:34] bad he said he said and then that devil
[1:06:37] came back around and says let's do this
[1:06:39] he said no less they gonna do nothing
[1:06:42] you do it see cuz you get me in trouble
[1:06:45] and I get the beaten
[1:06:50] I'm not even saying it lucky you know
[1:06:52] you know how to devastate okay let's go
[1:06:55] drink yeah no no how he says it
[1:06:57] oh you know you wanna drink I don't
[1:07:00] drink but I'm just using that for an
[1:07:02] example he's all you know you want a
[1:07:04] drink oh you want a drink you go drink
[1:07:06] cuz I'm not gonna do it the deviling
[1:07:09] will keep coming to you v ain't got no
[1:07:10] drinking party he need a drinking
[1:07:13] partner you love the Horde see this is
[1:07:23] the end
[1:07:23] but the Gentile bride of Christ you
[1:07:26] weren't you see when God took Israel and
[1:07:29] I understand I can see it clearly I came
[1:07:31] in like I told you if I could give it to
[1:07:32] you the way he gave it to me
[1:07:34] you know God talked to me last night and
[1:07:36] this message came from God I know it
[1:07:38] came from God the first part in the
[1:07:40] second part but my point is I can't seem
[1:07:43] to give it to you like he gave it to
[1:07:44] give it to you the way he gave it to me
[1:07:46] but I'm doing my best because I see now
[1:07:49] why should you fear a younger state I
[1:07:54] think David knew what he's talking about
[1:07:55] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:07:59] right and then gave us us who shall I
[1:08:02] fear the Lord is the light of my
[1:08:06] salvation he is a revelation to myself I
[1:08:09] can't save me
[1:08:10] you can't save you God is the savior of
[1:08:14] the soul
[1:08:16] is that right just like brother I'm
[1:08:18] saying even a preacher can't save you he
[1:08:21] can be under the anointing and he can
[1:08:22] preach it but God is the one that must
[1:08:25] save you he's not even a healer I'm no
[1:08:29] healer god is her healer he is the
[1:08:34] deliverer God is everything and he will
[1:08:36] not give his glory to no man the Gentile
[1:08:41] bride of Christ must prove to be a
[1:08:43] witness to the unity of God in his
[1:08:47] universe and in his people so you're not
[1:08:51] just here amen as as church members
[1:08:55] church members a dime a dozen now no I'd
[1:08:59] say 20 a dozen 20 or 20 but 24 for 10
[1:09:03] cent
[1:09:04] to death would you find him everywhere
[1:09:11] but what God is looking for is somebody
[1:09:15] that he can use even probably God said
[1:09:21] if God can get one man in the same y'all
[1:09:24] know that's my prayer that's my prayer
[1:09:27] ah I know there are other Christians in
[1:09:30] this message I know that but you know
[1:09:32] I'm looking for a hundred percent I
[1:09:34] really want God to use me a hundred
[1:09:36] percent you see it doesn't matter how
[1:09:39] small it may seem as long as I do what
[1:09:43] he wants me to do you know I think about
[1:09:46] this woman and I'm closing now but I got
[1:09:48] a two more things I want to state this
[1:09:51] woman at Simon's house you don't yell
[1:09:53] you do y'all realize the courage it took
[1:09:56] for her to enter into Simon's house she
[1:10:00] was a prostitute she could have been
[1:10:01] readily stoned right she was a
[1:10:05] prostitute folks they could have stolen
[1:10:07] her and you know they moved out of her
[1:10:10] way but I can almost see her you know
[1:10:15] you know sometimes when people want to
[1:10:17] really brush up interior here you think
[1:10:19] you better than me huh yeah brother
[1:10:22] Mannis say she elbowed her way through
[1:10:24] the crowd and you know and that means
[1:10:28] she forcibly entered she got in there
[1:10:33] and she got the crying and weeping she
[1:10:38] had Church all by herself listen that
[1:10:43] look that an auntie was right there and
[1:10:45] all she knew is that she was enjoying
[1:10:47] herself y'all you know say that's what I
[1:10:51] said this morning until we get rid of
[1:10:53] this pride that we have among ourselves
[1:10:55] this dignity and whatever you call it
[1:10:58] Amen I uh you know you you always
[1:11:03] worried about what other people think
[1:11:04] about you as long as you think like that
[1:11:06] you ain't gonna get it you're not gonna
[1:11:08] get it the way you want it because God
[1:11:10] would come and touch you or he might say
[1:11:13] shout oh he might say say hallelujah
[1:11:16] and then if you do this you just missed
[1:11:20] him
[1:11:23] you just missed him
[1:11:25] I remember one time praying for the Holy
[1:11:28] Ghost years ago when I was really really
[1:11:30] praying for the Holy Ghost and and and I
[1:11:32] got to a place it just like I knew this
[1:11:34] was the next move I was just right there
[1:11:37] and the devil said if you're going any
[1:11:40] further you're gonna lose your mind and
[1:11:42] I for a moment like brother said I
[1:11:46] stopped for a moment and when I did the
[1:11:49] Holy Ghost now just just like that you
[1:11:52] know why because I didn't trust him I
[1:11:57] lost trust right that's what he wanted
[1:11:59] me he wanted me to push and now that I'm
[1:12:01] in the message you know what you know
[1:12:03] brother don't say you got to push
[1:12:04] through the sound barrier
[1:12:06] the devil is telling you you're you're
[1:12:08] gonna get in you ain't worthy you know
[1:12:09] that means you are wise that's been
[1:12:12] you've gone to get it he's the man
[1:12:14] there's time to stop you from God there
[1:12:16] Oh
[1:12:17] then we winning winning when he can't
[1:12:19] stop you they so you know you tied you
[1:12:21] gotta work you got to do this you gotta
[1:12:23] do that he pause all those obligations
[1:12:26] on you the moment you stop because he
[1:12:29] you're getting the Holy Ghost must be
[1:12:31] more important than your job your school
[1:12:34] your family friends and all these things
[1:12:37] has to be is that right
[1:12:49] you know I saw what brother Bennett told
[1:12:51] sister say sisters you need to you know
[1:12:54] you don't how'd he say it I can't say it
[1:12:57] verbatim but he says like if she you
[1:12:59] know she has her duties he says stop all
[1:13:01] that get with God
[1:13:03] don't worry about cooking and dishes and
[1:13:06] all that right some of these brothers
[1:13:10] wouldn't want to hear that but sometimes
[1:13:14] the sisters fear for their husbands more
[1:13:16] than they fear God and when you know you
[1:13:18] need God hallelujah move out my way I'm
[1:13:22] coming you gotta be that way
[1:13:25] fanatical is what God needs some
[1:13:28] fanatics hmm
[1:13:30] y'all come on y'all know it's the truth
[1:13:32] if we could be toward God like these
[1:13:35] football and basketball teams are a
[1:13:37] mentored to our dear God a piece of pig
[1:13:41] skin or whatever full of hair and they
[1:13:43] jump in with their shirts off and all of
[1:13:45] us all of us they got y'all don't know
[1:13:47] they doing our dance
[1:13:50] that's what where were you Joe when the
[1:13:53] sons of God jumped for joy huh it's just
[1:13:56] a devil mimicking us hallelujah
[1:14:02] and they getting out there doing all the
[1:14:04] stuff and then they come and said now
[1:14:06] you be quiet now you'd be consecrated oh
[1:14:11] ho lord have mercy
[1:14:13] ah I believe David was a man of God's
[1:14:18] own heart because david knew what god
[1:14:20] liked and wanted and he gave it to him
[1:14:25] you know all of us don't worship the
[1:14:28] same now i'm not saying it but give God
[1:14:30] whatever you have right
[1:14:32] you give him if he's got a one hand
[1:14:35] salute give it to him y'all know that
[1:14:39] man that I'm closing you know the man
[1:14:40] down and um uh uh you know a random
[1:14:45] tabernac he's going to be with the Lord
[1:14:47] and uh he go hey he's a black brother
[1:14:56] he's a black brother brother brother Tom
[1:14:59] Brown y'all he's going on the view of
[1:15:01] the Lord he said they was getting ready
[1:15:03] to sit down and their brothers in high
[1:15:15] it scared him so bad he scoot all out
[1:15:18] the chair and they went to ask brother
[1:15:21] Brandon was that the Holy Ghost brother
[1:15:22] and said you better believe it is listen
[1:15:28] from now you hear them on the take some
[1:15:30] time hi
[1:15:37] he said the holy goes to hear them at
[1:15:39] some of the strangest times it could be
[1:15:41] quiet easy Oh bless its heart you know
[1:15:47] what I'm trying to say it's whatever God

[1:22:03] bet somebody help me you know I don't I
[1:22:09] have no doubt you don't tell the Lord I
[1:22:11] said Lord you know me I say God you know
[1:22:14] me
[1:22:14] I said if you take me before the rapture
[1:22:17] I said I just want people to know I made
[1:22:19] it do something to encourage the people
[1:22:24] that I made it you know manok I was a
[1:22:30] out in a Colorado California Arizona one
[1:22:34] time and a brother brother uh the pastor
[1:22:37] wanted us to go pray for this one sister
[1:22:39] and God told me don't go because this
[1:22:41] was a time now people think I'm crazy
[1:22:43] when I tell him God said if I ever say
[1:22:45] that God said you better believe God
[1:22:47] said because I don't just say that
[1:22:50] randomly or loosely and everybody so why
[1:22:54] don't you come on in God says no I said
[1:22:57] uh you know no because I had experienced
[1:23:00] that one time before brother Dorsey
[1:23:02] local brother right now in Michigan his
[1:23:09] first wife died and we were at a camp
[1:23:11] meeting and I got jumped because the
[1:23:15] people told me I well you need to come
[1:23:17] pray with us all the minister's going on
[1:23:19] says no God told me it was her time to
[1:23:21] go home oh you cursing the lady you
[1:23:23] should be saying stuff like that I said
[1:23:26] they shot me I said well what am I
[1:23:28] supposed to do God told me not to pray
[1:23:30] for cuz it was her time to go home
[1:23:32] yeah I had three two or three brothers
[1:23:35] that really got hard on me because I
[1:23:37] said dad and I think before we left
[1:23:39] Michigan that's just ahead on going home
[1:23:41] and they had prophesied saying that she
[1:23:43] was gonna rage she was gonna live
[1:23:45] thank God told me no it wasn't gonna
[1:23:48] happen same way with the lady there in
[1:23:50] in Arizona I didn't go but I heard the
[1:23:53] story they said when when they got to
[1:23:56] the hospital said all her children
[1:23:58] children was at the hospital and nobody
[1:24:00] called each other she was in a coma
[1:24:03] ready to go and all of a sudden she woke
[1:24:05] up and she saw all of our children and
[1:24:08] everything and I can't remember all she
[1:24:10] said but she was glad to see him and the
[1:24:14] late they said the lady starts talking
[1:24:17] about people who she was seeing in the
[1:24:19] room just like bars were seeing all the
[1:24:21] people in the room and stuff amen and
[1:24:23] she began to see all the people in the
[1:24:24] room all of a sudden she broke out and
[1:24:26] Amazing Grace laid back
[1:24:28] went home that's what I'm talking about
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:37] all my life trying to make people know
[1:24:40] that that dimension is real so when I
[1:24:43] enter into it I want God if he doesn't
[1:24:45] do nothing else you know he don't have
[1:24:47] to do a hallelujah you know I don't know
[1:24:50] what he would like do but my point is I
[1:24:52] want people to know I made it
[1:24:54] God is good to me and I'm gonna tell you
[1:24:57] something people when when you see God
[1:24:59] every preacher no he ain't he's not
[1:25:03] worthy of this pulpit there's nothing
[1:25:07] about me that makes me worthy of this
[1:25:08] pulpit
[1:25:09] I have battles just like all of you and
[1:25:14] their days I do good in days I don't but
[1:25:19] I know how to call on God and ask God
[1:25:21] for forgiveness I know how to ask God
[1:25:24] for his cleansing power hmm when I
[1:25:27] thought it ain't always pure but I try
[1:25:29] my best to keep them that way I listen
[1:25:32] just like I said this morning
[1:25:34] I said I listened to tapes almost every
[1:25:35] day I pray every day
[1:25:38] I may not pray hour after hour sometimes
[1:25:40] I pray hours sometimes I don't I just go
[1:25:43] by the leading of the Lord however he is
[1:25:44] it's not like like talk a little or my
[1:25:47] wife sometimes my conversation with my
[1:25:48] wife is short sometimes they're low
[1:25:50] that's how it is with God don't put them
[1:25:53] in a box let God have his way I asked
[1:25:56] the people I said how many of y'all be
[1:25:57] listening to tapes you know people can
[1:26:00] sit right there and they can judge you
[1:26:01] and they think you don't even hear what
[1:26:03] they're saying or thinking and here you
[1:26:04] are in the Spirit of God and God telling
[1:26:06] you things and you preaching things and
[1:26:08] you know where it's going and and they
[1:26:10] think you don't know but see they fail
[1:26:13] to see this ain't me once I'm in the
[1:26:15] anointing it ain't me that's God is
[1:26:17] talking and they failed it's like
[1:26:20] brother said they they take that he's so
[1:26:21] bad he's so powerful yet when he when
[1:26:24] he's on the scene they don't recognize
[1:26:26] his presidency that's how come so many
[1:26:28] people miss God and we look at things
[1:26:31] and we say lord have mercy I can't tell
[1:26:35] you folks but honestly honestly and just
[1:26:39] if it's if it's just that anointing on
[1:26:41] me
[1:26:42] keep pushing and praying and fighting
[1:26:44] amen to move forward I just believe that
[1:26:47] the rapture is so close at hand I don't
[1:26:49] say that to be saying it I really do
[1:26:52] believe it I don't know what that's
[1:26:56] gonna happen in 2019 but a sister sent
[1:26:58] me a little thing about about about it
[1:27:00] happening in 2019 in May but I can tell
[1:27:04] you when I really believe it's going to
[1:27:05] happen around Easter because brother
[1:27:10] branham lean too much water one Easter
[1:27:13] morning resurrection morning
[1:27:18] it happened on our Christmas did you
[1:27:29] know that brother Branham was actually
[1:27:30] born on the same day Jesus it's in there
[1:27:34] a medium told him that your birthday was
[1:27:39] the same day of Jesus's and God gave it
[1:27:42] to you as a memorial so whenever he was
[1:27:45] born that's when Jesus was more that's
[1:27:48] why the pillar of fire come down look
[1:27:53] same scenario Jesus was in a cave
[1:27:59] brother Anna was in a shag what's the
[1:28:02] difference huh
[1:28:06] springtime hmm so I'm just sharing with
[1:28:10] you by God's grace I really believe
[1:28:13] that's when it's gonna be because if you
[1:28:16] read the sixth seal you'll find out
[1:28:17] it'll be around that time it won't be
[1:28:20] Anna in the wintertime persecution to
[1:28:23] come in right sides and season seasons
[1:28:28] work with signs you know as harsh and
[1:28:31] hard in the wintertime you know pray
[1:28:33] that your flight be not in the winter
[1:28:34] all right yeah where's God you know we
[1:28:38] we are blessed people I love spring
[1:28:42] because it's quiet when when it's
[1:28:44] blossoming nobody hear those little
[1:28:46] little flowers opening up
[1:28:53] my hitta thunderstorm we might here see
[1:28:55] the lightning but that little flower is
[1:28:57] just really enjoying everything is every
[1:29:03] other scene went a little slow for
[1:29:03] slow-moving movies when nature's
[1:29:06] blooming and blossoming there is just
[1:29:08] like like beautiful dance you know I'm
[1:29:14] getting carried away let's let's stay
[1:29:21] yeah I'm feeling pretty good myself yeah
[1:29:25] Satan anyway I'm feeling pretty good
[1:29:30] because I realized her it's difficult
[1:29:35] for my mind to grasp it though but I
[1:29:38] believe I'm a seed of God that's what
[1:29:42] inspires me that's what keeps me moving
[1:29:45] alright and I believe that nothing can
[1:29:50] take it from me no matter how hard Satan
[1:29:54] fights that's one thing he can't take
[1:29:57] away and he's amazing cuz everytime
[1:29:59] Satan tried to come in a certain way God
[1:30:01] would come right back and say say
[1:30:03] remember your mind ha ha I love the Lord
[1:30:09] don't ever think God is so small he
[1:30:12] can't handle your problems
[1:30:15] remember that sway the devil will us
[1:30:17] turn it make make us think that God is
[1:30:19] little he's small God is all that in all
[1:30:23] he hears you before you call he answers
[1:30:28] your prayer before you ask he's always
[1:30:31] there even in those little small time
[1:30:35] when you say Lord I need a little sleep
[1:30:36] God gives you sleep when you say God
[1:30:41] increased my thirst for you he increased
[1:30:44] your thirst he's always there he just
[1:30:47] you know and the thing about it I forget
[1:30:50] some time but he says I'll never leave
[1:30:53] you nor will I forsake you I will be
[1:30:57] with you always even to the end of time
[1:31:01] my god is awesome he can
[1:31:06] do anything when man fail when man stop
[1:31:11] God has that opportunity to show himself
[1:31:16] that's why the devil don't want you to
[1:31:18] know that he wants you to think God is
[1:31:21] small and he's greater than God and you
[1:31:25] know he won't to entrap you and you make
[1:31:27] you think that whatever trap he got you
[1:31:29] in you can't get out and the Bible said
[1:31:32] that God breaks the Fowler's snare he's
[1:31:36] the one that breaks and destroy the
[1:31:38] yokes God is and I know by God's grace
[1:31:42] if you depend on him he will never let
[1:31:47] you down never ever let you down let's
[1:31:56] pray father we thank you for being so
[1:32:01] good to us and forgive me Lord if I got
