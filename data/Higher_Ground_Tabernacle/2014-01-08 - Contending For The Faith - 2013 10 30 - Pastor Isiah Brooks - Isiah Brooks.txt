TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're going to ask as we stand let us go right to two passages of scripture Hebrews 12:16 and then we go to Jude 13 Hebrews 126 you love the Lord amen amen let's start read let's read um uh the 14th verse follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness spring up and trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau for one Marshal of meat sold his Birthright Jude please Jude first chapter we're going to read the third verse beloved when I gave all excuse me beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write to you and exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you Father for being so real to us we thank you for being so good Lord you've been better to us than we have been to ourselves and Lord we just pray father that you cleanse us tonight and forgive us for all of our sins anything that we may have said done thought oh God anything that is not pleasing to you Lord and not in your will father continue to instruct us continue to lead us continue to cleanse us Lord with your fire of the Holy Spirit Lord I pray here tonight that you would give us Grace to move completely out of your way and Lord uh let thy will be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen we appreciate the Lord Jesus and everything that he's doing my we had a wonderful time at Bible study last night Amen Brother Rich said it was the best he've had I said it was my best too I thought it was pretty good you know the Lord really came down and really blessed us by the grace of God but while I was actually uh uh we were teaching on last night uh something just kind of came to my heart in my mind and that was contending for the faith reason being is that we're living in a crucial time we're living in a Time amen where judgment and everything else is coming out our way and the thing about it is I don't know whether people know what faith is what the faith is uh because remember uh the word of God said when the son of man shall come shall he find the faith the faith is not a thing it is not a feeling it is not an emotion but the faith is a person amen let's say it like this in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and then Hebrew says by faith God created the heavens and the Earth and then the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ created the heavens and the Earth so by Jesus Christ God created the heavens and the Earth amen so we look at this thing and this is the whole argument in our day in our time on whether Jesus Christ is whether he is God whether he is the only God whether he is the only Creator that's the argument remember this argument or this uh subject just didn't start but the subject started in heaven when Lucifer said in his heart I will descend Ascend above the Throne of God so he likened himself to be God Amen and that's where the argument and it is still Lucifer is still claiming to be God now uh we understand that before Calvary Lucifer had power he had strength he deceived many he had men Hearts full of fear but the Bible tells us that Calvary God conquered death hell and the grave now what Lucifer did in in all of his doing he brought in all kinds of assorted let me put it this way assorted religions and all these assorted religions led to Lucifer or Satan but God only ever he's ever he's never had but one way Lucifer has assorted way he he has always being a liberal and we find out by the grace of God that we are now coming to a place and I really believe that the Rapture is on and it's been on for a while but it's picking up amen you know uh we'll speed up and it'll slow down and we realize by the grace of God God Amen I I I forgot the uh great uh uh uh uh man of God that once said we must prepare for battle in a time of peace and this is what the message is all about here tonight that you and I might come to a place that we are preparing for battle amen right we must know that there that the battle is on in it's not or when it's going to start it has been in array for a long while now and but we must as we see this enemy coming we must uh uh uh Place ourselves in a position of War now we we understand that uh none of this can be achieved by us it must be faith and we understand according to habca the word of God said behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith not your faith not my faith but his faith is that all right now Faith is uh is a law and this law contr thows all things I want you to think about what I just said faith is a law and this law controls all things because by faith God created so by faith God created let's say the world or creation and then creation brought forth the law right so in other words after the creation you can find the law that brought the creation and the law was God's way of doing things and let's put it this way he said listen he said let there be he spoke what he wanted to be created and he never died doubted it he believed what he said and it came to pass and that law still holds for the believer amen faith it is a master of all circumstances amen no matter what it is it Masters all circumstances hello somebody in other words I don't care what your circumstances are faith will slow walk it and Conquer it amen and you see our faith is not in a human being because what we're going to see down the road is that this world want us to put Faith in a system or faith in a person called a pope or you know what I'm saying our faith is not any in any any other king outside of the king of kings now I want you to see that when when we we we uh uh how can I say it here job knows that faith is not just anything CU job says in the 13th chapter 8th verse will we ex will ye accept his person or and it says will ye contend with God right so we realize you've got a choice you can receive him or you can fight with him you can receive him or you can fight with him hello somebody but remember faith is on your side amen I like this when we talk about contending for the faith we're literally talking about contending or arguing or fighting or striving with all opposition amen that willah denounce God belittle God in any kind of way as to say he's not the same he doesn't exist or any sort of thing like that we're here to contend amen and to prove and to declare that the Jesus Christ that lives today is the Jehovah of the Old Testament and he is the creator of all things now we're not going to uh uh submit ourselves to anything less than that as I was studying I thought about uh inent that Keith to Shar with me some years ago about being in this Bible study and this uh man he he told in the Bible study he said Jesus Christ is God and the man got really upset about it hello now how can a Christian who knows God per se say that Jesus Christ is not God let me say like this I've been really studying this thing because I've been telling people this for a long time even when I was in Li Lima or I want you to know that every preacher every renowned person that you see supposedly in the pull pit is not for Jesus Christ there are people who are Jesuits who have filtrated the rinking of this message come on somebody and they come out with these strange odd doctrines and you wonder what this all about but I will will not stand with any man who refus to acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is my faith hello somebody if you take the word of God and you go back to the Old Testament that's what it was the Holy Ghost the pill of fire however you want to say him you know here was the ark of the Covenant right there with Israel and Israel was always protecting it why because that was their faith that was their God come on somebody they always protected it because that was their faith that was their God let me I wrote down a few things that faith is Faith is a gift itself faith is a positive sense faith is the six sense faith is a direct Revelation it is something you uh uh subconsciously do faith has a pull faith is fearless faith is the victory faith has a long range Vision come on somebody faith is a substance faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer faith is a law of God and faith and by it all things are accessible all things all things I love it the way Jesus says and I'm tying this in now he said if you have the faith of a mustard seed he didn't say size he said faith if you have the faith of a mustard seed and then according to the Book of John the Bible said if the seed remains in you you cannot sin then brother brandham comes along and he says in the midst of your heart is a is a little place in there by the size of a pinpoint pin head right kind of like a mustard seed and he says basically if that if that little place in your heart is quickened it is not something he's telling us it's not something that could be hybrid or mixed or or watered down or it is pure faith and that little speck that little pin head that's in your heart is able to move mountains amen why because that little pin head is God Amen when God is occupying the Throne of your heart that's why people I feel it all over me that's the anointing that's just a a a portion of it but his life is there whether you feel it or not amen whether you feel it or not it's there but he said in that day you'll know that I'm in the father that's why I thank God God ain't in Rome God is in my heart Hallelujah but there's a lot of people believe that God is in Rome Hallelujah sitting up there amen with a big hat whatever you call it and go God don't have to ride in Pop mobile come on God don't need man's protection Hallelujah man needs God protection now let's move on faith is something sometime you don't even know you have but it's there amen cuz God don't show he don't put on the show for anybody he is God right and you and I you say well what do you why are you preaching this because I'm telling you when you believe that you're a true son and daughter of God hold to that amen amen hello somebody you hold to that come on because listen you're not doing the work it's the faith in you that's doing the work what did God tell Israel hold still I'll fight your battles that same God that fought Israel's battles are the it's the same God that's fighting our battles but he said you hold still then he comes on and says listen Israel I'm going to put I want you to do something for me because I like it some people don't understand why God loves worship God loves worship because there's a law if you worship me I'll bless you see we're not the one God ain't so much being blessed because he gave us everything so he gives you everything he said give it back and I'll bless you with it amen right come on the more you say Jesus the closer he becomes to you right y'all hear what I'm saying and that is the key to worship worship you you give back to God what he's given you God comes down and rewards you for giving it back to him that's why I try to tell people I said listen when you come to church the Bible tells us that God inhabits the praise of his people huh it's just amazing it amazes me you you know uh how uh the world can get such their people on such a one Accord and we we we come to church and and can't get everybody just on one Accord to worship and the worship is not you know you're not here to uh bless uh brother Isaac or me is about God contending for the faith when the devil say you ought to be quiet you said no I heard the prophet said wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise so I'm going to put my share of the noise in the pot right I I noise a lot of time noise brings Victory too right he said Gideon he said I want you to take your lamp and and I want you to crack this thing and when you crack it I want you to make a Lou of noise blow them trumpet come on somebody and every one of us got a trumpet Hallelujah that's what the Bible say cry loud blow the trumpets in Zion Hallelujah he ain't talking about this he talking about this Hallelujah blow it Hallelujah that's a time of of war and victory and this is what God God is excited now you don't y'all might not believe this but he is God is really excited Hallelujah you said well how would you know brother Bruce wouldn't you be wouldn't you be excited when you know that this this this time that I have designated for the bride to be made manifest is just a moment away she'll come into her full bloom she'll come into her full manifestation you know God don't run out of patience but I'm sure he's been waiting cuz the Bible said he was he waits for his precious fruit amen hallelujah so God is excited about all of you amen thank you Lord he ain't worried about it I don't know why you are am he's the Creator he's the maker of all things and he you worried about it where God can do it and he's still holding the sun holding the moon holding all the stars and the consolation in his hand and and you looking at your little itty bitty problem that he can't even see under a microscope it's nothing but the truth we add burdens that God can't even F can you imagine cast your burdens the whole Christian people is casting their burdens on God and he don't even feel amen no heavier than he ever been he's still God Amen God don't have no weight I hope you can see what I'm trying to say Amen listen so we contending for it we're preparing for battles we we're taking God at his word for everything when Satan rais his head God has given us the authority to take it offen hello why are you saying this because I'm saying when battles come is for you amen God's battles the battles that come in your life is for youen and God want to mature you in those battles he want to give you a testimony y'all it's going to be a sad thing to get over there with no testimony when God said the over overcome the world by the blood and the word of their testimony you got to have a testimony that's why he's sending you through these things Hallelujah and by faith I am a victory a Victor hallelujah hallelujah I've got it amen I don't have to feel it I know God has saved me and I know I'm bride how you know brother Brook by faith I know that I am and faith is a revel turn with me to Matthew's 8th chapter please most of the time we just get in the way that's all we get in the way you get frustrated God said don't get frustrated because the devil get you frustrated he'll get you to sin he get you to doing things you ain't got no business doing right he said don't don't be that way right don't let no building spring up in you because he the devil knows if bitterness come up in you now you got an attitude and he can get you to do things that you wouldn't normally do then he goes on and say you be careful because what the devil does he he put a bitterness in you then he makes you feel lonely then he says listen you go get you some comfort then all of a sudden you become a fornicator he said don't be like that that's Esau profane ungodly Hallelujah you trying to find comfort in the world and God got your comfort I'mma tell you something Solomon was never satisfied that's the truth a thousand wives and he never was satisfied probably if he could have lived long and you know what I'm saying he would have had it more than that but he never was satisfied and I'm going tell you something you'll never satisfy this flesh no sir the only time you can put this thing under under control is get the Holy Ghost Hallelujah come on somebody it's nothing but the truth Satan get you to doing things you ain't got no business doing because amen and you know what the this the part the scary about it you can do it one too many and sell your Birthright you don't want to do that you don't but that's where he's driving you amen driving you to a point where if you cry out to God there's no more repentance that's what selling your Birthright is Now understand this you got to pull and you here that means you're still okay thank you Lord hallelujah but don't play too long with God y'all hear what I'm saying amen cuz when you when you said listen I I just don't know I I tell you what I that that used to scare me all the time when the Bible said Esau sought it and couldn't find it that scared me you know but one thing about Esau he never came back to God if you've come back to God and you there that ain't you you understand me God has drawn you into a place because I always look at it I said you know when when it comes to backsliding we backslide every day one way or another I'm telling you you do you do Matthew 88 listen the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed now come on this is so powerful to me to see a centurion a man who is a Roman citizen don't even know anything about Jehovah God but have heard Jesus and when he is saying this he's saying I know you're God I know you're the Messiah when all of the Jews didn't want to believe he was this man said I know you got Authority he said I understand Authority I'm a centurion and I can tell my me go go they go stay stay they stay he said you don't even have to go where I want you to go you speak the word he understood that the demons this was a supernatural man that's the faith God is Supernatural all things are possible to them that believe amen the same faith that caus you to believe you could be saved it's the same Faith that'll take you into the Rapture he said for I'm a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when Jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith know not in Israel now remember it's a giften and God had given that Centurion faith in Christ did it work if you confidence that God is can do it then God will do it if you have the confidence that God will do it he'll do it amen thank you Lord right come on somebody it's the truth like he said he said to that that woman you you know we used this illustration so many times you know I I don't give the the children's bread to dogs see see it was something subconsciously she didn't even know she was a Daughter of Zion she didn't even know what made her believe it but she believed it anyway and for some reason she said the right thing just like had it right all had a right was he she wasn't there but she heard about those squirrels and she said that ain't nothing but the truth brother brandom and God thundered out of heaven and said give her what she want whatever she asked for give her what she want he said she could have asked for a million a million calite whatever she wanted she said but she asked for The Souls of her two sons and when she said Lord give me the souls of my two son the Holy Ghost fell and baptized them right there amen hallelujah come on and there'll be there amen oh come on somebody they didn't those boys didn't even have to stay at the altar amen hallelujah come on somebody they were act actually giggling and everything else and God dropped repentance in their heart right then and all of a sudden the holy go seal them you said they were crying and balling all over the floor that's what the that's what God will do for you now that's what that's kind of faith that God drop in your heart when you need it all you got to do is keep saying Amen to the word am and mean it from your heart and God will get you there Hallelujah come on somebody amen he said I say unto you that many shall come from the East and the west and shall sat down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven and he goes on said but the children of this Kingdom will be cast out and they were they were destroyed and killed over there in 70 AD hello that's Matthew 17 please and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for I say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of a mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to Y the place and it shall remove and not shall and and nothing shall be impossible unto you I believe it amen hallelujah if you got enough Faith to move a mountain you got enough Faith to move a car you got enough Faith to stop win you got enough listen he take he didn't take just a little little something he took a huge mountain as his illustration so you can see how impossible it would be to do that without faith why because I told you faith is not a thing it's a person it's Jesus Christ believing what you said Hall oh my God Hallelujah St Mark please we're not going to be long here tonight St Mark four the worst thing you can ever try to do is figure out try to figure out oh how it's going to be done you don't have to figure it out you know God said let there be if he wasn't up there okay calculating now how it's going to be done I mean which going to come first he said it all right St Mark 4:39 I'm telling you it's the truth I've heard this testimony so many time one time before and I've said it many times this sister I think she lived in Jeffers and Ville at the time and uh she her children was wward and uh you know she get up and testify in church I'm so thankful to have my God my children serving the Lord with all of their hearts and just uh worshiping God and loving God and and you know and people got to the place they kind of got tired of hearing it and one sister came o over to her and said sister you know that's actual lying you know you shouldn't be saying it like that she said it all depends on what you're looking at huh amen Faith got a long range Vision sir Hallelujah and Abraham called those things that be not as though they were hallelujah amen you don't you know you you you know the Bible said you know that's what it look he said but let God's word be true and every man be a liar you don't look at near we no we look way out there and we call it like it is God promised it you keep testifying and praising God for it amen amen hallelujah oh not no hope no God said so if I've got the faith to believe it and speak it it shall happen that's the truth amen that's the truth you said circumstances come upon me sometime and I don't know what to do okay let's hold fast St Mark will tell you just what to do St Mark 4 that all right 39 4th verse and he rose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great Cal and he said unto them why are ye so fearful that's when you know you ain't got it when your circumstances has caused you to be fearful faith is absence because faith is fearless amen hello some come on somebody amen faith is fearless so when fear is there and I don't mean fear won't come but perfect life cast out fear Hallelujah and when that fear overtakes you and you're worrying faith is not there you spoke BR it but you didn't believe it and they feared and they listen and said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith now here was Jesus on the boat like Jesus in in your boat he's in you they knew he was there they woke him up Lord cares thou not that we perish how can you drown with eternal life's laying right there and you know the situation what it was he was laying there as a father and a tutorer he wanted them to stand up and say peace be still that's why he rebuked them yes there are times God would do it for us but he wants us to do it while you crying Moses you speak it and believe it I don't understand it sometimes but I'm going tell you even witches got more faith in their working than we have in ours they'll conjure up some stuff and do this whatever they do and believe it and it happens because faith is a law amen faith is a law faith is a law you've heard of people amen they talking about adrenaline caught and fell on a loved one and that woman pick it up like this ear and don't even know how she did it Faith she was caught up into a revelation she was going to do it it happened before she even knew it that's what faith will do hello somebody listen St Mark 4:39 and 40 all right let's 41 and they feared it sealingly and said one to another what matter of man is this it wasn't no man see it it shows that Revelation wasn't right brother B said they Revelation wasn't right at that point because they're asking what not a man is this it wasn't a man who did it it was God who did it amen even the Centurion had a better Revelation amen of what his own disciples had at this point in time what kind of man they was no man that was God on the boat Hallelujah that was God brother brandom even tried to help us to tell us like Jesus never healed one person he tried to help us with that that it was God doing the work he said I can't do nothing except the father show me so it was God doing the work he saw God doing and he just put himself in the place where God was doing it amen hallelujah it ain't you it always will be God come on somebody ain't God good to us contending for the faith because you know we've got all listen what's going to happen understand when the when this squeeze come on us and this thing began to happen you think you going the only one be with signs and wonders that wasn't like that in Exodus time in in in Janice and jambre time they had power they did some things that the eyes were able to see that's what confuses the Pentecostals they could be all off the raw word and they still have SE Miracles because they don't understand the law of Faith you don't have to be a Christian to see a miracle you just got to have faith oh my goodness he talks about he tried to tell us he said those James and those Hindus over there they can take swords and push it through here and walk on Coes how many of y'all can do it yes every one of you can do it if you put your faith to it it wasn't a trick question but as a human being you can't do that but they believe that if I they could walk it and they it happens because it's a law Jesus believed he could walk on the water it happened Peter believed he could walk on the water it happened but as soon as his faith failed him you'all see what I'm saying amen so don't tell me that we can't walk on water we can do it amen ain't God good to us I heard something in the other day and I thought man that is something interesting something I had never heard of but you know what I often wondered how uh um Adam was even able to name fish and all that think about it he named everything all the Beast and all you think about it what what was what was going on where Adam could even name fish and birds and cuz Dominion to to have dominion it means that you are above them above everything that's created just a good question I don't know the answer but I'm saying F something some things that God hasn't told us yet you you don't think he communicate okay let me put it this way either he created all those fish that Peter caught or he called them and told him to come by this way huh something he did we don't know how he did it he either created all those fish or somehow he communicated with those fish and they came you don't thinkk God oh was just a coincidence that this whale that God prepared for Jonah was just swimming through the y'all hear what I'm saying God prepared a fish for Jonah amen perfect timing throw me overboard when you see what God God can do it whatever your situations are God can change it but you got to speak it and believe it amen whatsoever you ask in my name believing that you shall receive it it shall be given unto you contending for the faith is action action John 5:38 ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he have sent him ye believe not huh now his word is Faith by faith God created and how did he do it word he spoke it and he goes on and talks up tell these people listen if if my word is not abiding in you you you don't have you you I'm listen let's let's turn there amen St John 5 ain't God good to us people is it's right in front of us it's not something that you got to muster up brother bam told tells us about little simple Faith something told me I can pick this up and I just did it I didn't have to know the mathematics behind it I just did it he said when you he said Faith does this because you are actually uh Defying Gravity amen but something in you telling you I can do this right there was no effort in that it was just it is what it is you know when you sweating and everything else oh like I told somebody and I've told them many times you done pray for somebody and the temperature going up and you say take the temperature again you just lost it because Faith don't have to take it a second time when you do that now you you worked against your faith if you really got faith you don't have to check it it works against it because what is now what if the temperature is no longer 102 but 104 well out of your mou oh it's getting words and you say well I didn't say it but you thought it and in heaven he hears your thoughts quicker than he does your words see what I'm saying so let let's read this here come quickly so let's hurry up so um okay there's another coming from the 32nd verse there's another that beareth witness of me and I know that the witness which he Witnesses of me is true ye sent unto John and he Beed witness unto the truth but I received not testimony from man but these things I say that you might be saved he was a burning and a Shining Light and you were willing for a season rejoice in his light but I have greater witness than that of John for The Works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father ha sent me and the father himself have sent me have borne witness of me ye have nether heard of his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he ha sent him ye believe not come on somebody and he and and that goes on for the day amen hallelujah people well I got the word I got the word listen God sent us a prophet if you can't believe the word that God sent you don't you don't believe amen you say you do but it's a revelation it is it is a revelation it's truly a revelation but I know you that you have not the love of God St John 5:42 right let's let's let's let's finish reading that right search the scriptures for in them that you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and ye will not come to me that you might have life and ye will not come to me that you will have not life I receive not honor from men but I know you that you have not the love of God in you now that is something for God to say I know you now remember Amen in the in the chapter there when those disciple of whoever it is they come and they said Lord haven't we done great things in your name their their approach in itself has given them away on who they are amen Lord did not we do great things in your name see first of all if you ever do anything for God you know you've never done anything amen here was a prophetic man who had done all these great things supposedly for God he's laying on his bed and he says my I have not done anything for the Lord and if I'm going to do anything I better get up and be about my father's business amen millions of Souls save for God and he's laying there thinking he's not done anything see that's the way a true servant believe that's the way that's what's in his heart he whatever he he's doing it can't Mount up to anything cuz he's doing nothing amen everything that's been done has been God Amen hallelu I know that you have not the love of God in you I am come in my father's name and you receive receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you shall receive you hear what he's saying if you don't receive the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're going to receive the pope because he's going to come in his own name he's telling you if you don't receive me you're going to receive the mark of the beast think about what he just said there see contending for the faith I want to say this cuz I was looking to looking at a little documentary today before coming but may God have mercy on us and I was just looking at what it took for the world to get this Bible to us the church all of the blood that's on this book all of the effort people have been killed their children loved ones murdered and killed through inquisitions and everything else uh uh Jesuits and you know Catholic church and you know and and think about it we've got the King James version right we've got the Bible that it took people you know Luther's Wesley they they love this word now in our day we got so much you hardly read it and we forget the cost what it took for you to get this into your hands and right now the Catholic church and that Machinery that God is right now working real hard to change this Bible back into something that will accept them there's a new Bible that has literally taken out the word Antichrist and here we are people at a generation that people don't even know nothing about the King James they getting this HIV I mean um NIV version and I didn't mean to say HIV I meant NIV I done said that so much till it just come programmed in my head but I mean NIV version and and the people don't know they don't even have the Holy Ghost to discern whether it's right or not amen and think about the spirit that's coming with it because it's there to unite people together so that they can understand there's no difference between you and me but there is a difference amen and I I I I for what I saw today and understand the word vika itself means Antichrist anti so when you look at this thing and you say oh my God you know I what you think how God going to judge us on this thing we won't read our word we won't we won't we won't we won't listen to our tapes and books and all and we we Christians we forget the blood stain is greater than the bloodstained Battle of that flag we got it's greater than that the cost that has taken and what's going to happen when this book is taken from your from your possession and then you don't have it in your heart how do you going to know how you going to speak a word youve never read or know to read or know to speak how you going to do it the commission for this age for the bride age was to eat the whole book come on somebody that means seals Church ages everything that comes with it amen and I guarantee you only a few of us have conquered that hello somebody now I was the Holy Spirit trying to get us on track prepare for battle in time of Peace because I'm going tell you something you think you think this thing is going to be so but you're going to be Satan knows how to smooth talk and how can I say it he did it to Eve all he had to do was change one word and get her to agree with it and it stripped her see and you don't know you you think well this pressure it won't be it w yes it will it's going to be pressure on every hand and let me tell you something folks if you don't have faith to believe God can take care of you now you going to have faith to take God going to take you that care down the road am I making sense oh people of God I say these things because I love you I love you and I love the word of God you know and and but you know and this is what I'm saying you you go on and and he says but in St John 14:20 he says at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you don't stop till you know that cuz that's your seal amen that is your seal that's marck in your forehead to know that you know that you know that God is in you I'm not talking about some false pregnancy amen y'all know some women have psychologically made them themselves believe that they were pregnant and they never were and they grew and went through the all the changes my wife can bear witness we know a woman who did that nine months and was nothing there she made herself believe that she was pregnant but with God you don't make yourself believe you know you had an experience you know something came in you you know something change your life I'm not talking about your flesh I'm talking about your soul amen your flesh going to always give you trouble it's going to always I hate that you a lot of us we don't want to want to hear that you know but it's true I don't like it either but that's the way God designed it but think about it this thing that gave you trouble all your life and then all of sudden a wind come through you and a sharp pain and the next thing you know you standing in your glorified it'll be worth it all amen I guarantee you you'll never miss this one God is after your soul he condemned your flesh so don't worry about your flesh will take care of itself God will take care of that think about it no matter how much you grooming it's still getting older but the soul is getting younger amen it's getting strong stronger amen is that right just give me a few more minutes amen can you please amen so God will is to live in his people his life through you in other words God wants you to be a walking Faith Tabernacle a walking Faith machine amen a walking Faith Tabernacle did you know David had a tabernacle I'm jumping on something I'm studying that now and I'm not fully right with it but David had a tabernacle the scripture says it but what David did David was showing amen that here Solomon was building the Temple but David had a tabernacle of his own and he took that Ark and he put it in his Tabernacle and David was showing what was going to happen to mankind that God was going to put see Jerusalem the New Jerusalem won't be nothing without God being in you amen is God in a tabernacle amen why we be in a tabernacle if that makes sense God in us and we in God that's the way it is listen he said if you abide in me and I in you as a branch cannot bear of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me now let me let me put it this way for some reason we have this in we have this thing we always put it off like like the World Church is thinking you know the Rapture is coming well the Rapture is here amen God is right now changing you from glory to glory oh they can't see it but it's happening God is now building a bride right now amen and when God seal you with the Holy Ghost you're Rapture material your soul has already been raptured that's why he can say you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen right and the world can't see it but it's happening now my point is this if you abide in me and I in you that's the key abiding in him and him in you ask what you will and he goes on to say you going to bear fruit amen you know what it is it's true I was reading some things about conelius and I forgot how many years the the word of God had been going I think it was 10 years after Pentecost when Kus uh Paul and then went to uh Peter and went to Kia's house but we think it was just just the other day 10 years nobody knew nothing about canas but God did and in one service canas in his whole house receive the Holy Ghost you see it's about God it ain't about you it's about God right so we look at this thing and you say brother what you look and it's just somehow we feel like we got to do this we got to be doing this this this this this this this this and God may have just ordained you to do one thing that could be just one Soul you bring to the Lord amen that could be all you ordained for you wonder Lord have I done anything for are you he said one soul is worth a million world Amen Hallelujah what can be greater than a soul you can have the power to heal you can have the power to prophesy all of that's going to cease but think about a soul the greatest thing you could ever do is win a soul to God Amen and the devil said will you haven't done nothing for the Lord and I'm going tell you something some of these seeds you planting you won't see until you get on the other side of Jordan I'm I'm going move on now amen Romans 8-9 8 and9 says but Ye Ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you hello now think what he just said I want you to really let's see it but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwells in you in other words if the spirit of God hallelujah if the spirit of God dwells in you he doesn't even see your flesh glory amen he's not judging oh come on somebody that's the scripture said let's read again but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwells in you amen because if the spirit of God dwells in you he's looking at that seed and he said that seed cannot s Lorden come on somebody now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his amen and if Christ be in you the body is dead L I want my body to be dead God said it's dead if Christ is in you the body in the eyes of God is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal body woo come on somebody amen let me move faster now amen so you can realize amen we must prepare for battle in time of peace Ephesians 21:18 says for through excuse me let's turn there Ephesians 21:18 that's the best way of doing it can't read no hand you love God 218 for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God come on think about it think about that you're a fellow citizens of God in heaven not Rome or anything like it oh my I I really do I do I do I do I do amen amen just going to read off a few more scriptures then I'm going read the quotes and I'm going let you go 1 Corinthians 16 says even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you it must be confirmed in you Hallelujah come on somebody amen it must be confirmed once it's confirmed the devil can't take it from you if Christ be in you I say it again the body is dead because of sin right amen listen what he says First Corinthians 3:16 know ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you yes Lord have y'all oh my goodness 1 Corinthians 6:19 what know you not that the B your body is the Temple of of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not what your own amen hallelujah it is the spirit of God that unites us together it ain't this building it's not these chairs it's not the name Higher Ground it's the holy ghost that unites Uso preparing you un ning times is that right amen by one Spirit you were baptized into one body according to 1 Corinthians 12:13 but let me read these quotes he says but if if you notice it was so beautifully Illustrated when the Great Pillar of Fire that followed the children of Israel through the Wilderness appeared to St Paul when it come down on the day of Pentecost it broke up and tongs of fire set upon each of them it was God in the pillar fire the loost separating himself among his people showing that Christ and the bride see see God and his church are becoming one why it's just the most beautiful thing you've ever seen then then together not in different organizations where we ever stand in a kuckian I'm a Kian to Together We Stand divide with fall why did the Indian lose the country to the white people it's because they wasn't they were divided among themselves how are we going to lose the great race it's because we're divided how we going to do it we've got to stay together we're all believers in God the holy Holy Ghost takes us all in it'll be a paradox if if God ever gets us together but he will amen just trust him the Virgin birth he knows how to send the persecution it's a shame it's a shame but he said he knows how to bring the persecution it'll run us together amen and it's coming coming you better believe it it's coming amen I won't have to worry about it as long you know as long as they let us have this place you won't have to worry about it will you you people will be showing up I think so now Pentecost was a paradox and how that God chose a bunch of illiterate fishermen that didn't even know their ABC they're told that Peter couldn't even sign his own name H the Bible said that he in John acts four was ignorant and unlearned but yet they had taken notice that they had been with Jesus now you know some Scholars are saying that that's not what God meant that Peter didn't he had his own business hello I know a lot of folks who couldn't read or write who had their own business now that's the main thing and how God chose now the church had trained up a bunch of men for that thousands of fine intellectual priests who know that word they said from all the meaning of it and everything studied it day and night just had it in in their hearts I can't help but to say it but let me say it God in our day rose up a seventh grade Kian confounded the people in his day with the scriptures confounded him and every time they challenged him you off the scriptures prove it to me right I think it was in Chicago when those men had then already set up what they were going to do brother bandam told him exactly where where they would be and he said if you don't believe the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said come up here and stand right he said they knew they weren't going to stand CU he knew that angel was on his right hand side right they knew better than that he said well if you just stay off my back let me tell you something there ain't a the Theologian in this world that don't know the acts 238 is not right they know it but because of money pressure and Jesuits they won't do it but they know it because the Bible said they hold the truth in unrighteousness they know it they know it the Bible Way whether they reason it away or not God chose a bunch of men that didn't even know their how to sign their name that was a paradox from taking a man who was trained from the word for the word and by the word and take a man know nothing about the word and confirming the word through him that was a paradox certainly was and let me tell you something that's where he'll do it right now God ain't requiring us to know nothing but what he sent what he said and he he I gotta pause here I'm sorry I'm trying to finish it but think about it we've got Bible now a book Scrolls they didn't have that and how many years it took them all they could do is remember what he said and go back to the Old Testament and glean from it then God in a man by the name of Paul Paul goes out in the desert for three and A2 years and come back with some preaching huh and they listen to Paul because here come Paul taking all the Old Testament types and bringing it to him and then they say oh my good even some of those things that Paul said was hard to be understood but they didn't go to church and they could open up the Bible like we can they didn't have that what made them know what was right is when the Holy Ghost was in you it'll say Amen to the truth and they arguing over the Greek when my God became Greek out into the streets they went screaming listen let me pick it up he says listen that was a paradox certainly was it was a paradox how that them people up in the upper room there afraid of the Jews and had walked with Jesus he says listen but when the Holy Ghost came woo he said the Jews they were afraid those who was up in the upper room they were there cuz they were afraid he said but when the Holy Ghost came they wasn't afraid no more see and that's how it will be when the squeeze come amen Supreme Grace will be given us uh Supreme Grace Supreme faith will produce Su Supreme Grace in the Supreme hour right right and out into the streets they went screaming falling acting like a bun bunch of drunken PE drunk people that was a paradox the Holy Ghost Came Upon them women and all they wasn't ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it certainly was a paradox they wasn't uh naturally natural they wasn't natural horses they breathe fire talking about now is I'm I'm working with something else now so you got to understand now here they they got power and authority to uh overcome the world to do whatever uh God would have them but let me let me tell you something in our day so you'll understand and and and I'm maybe I'm I'm I'm too long here but but listen we are in for something I'm I'm working with faith because it's going to take Faith to get you through this brother BR talks about amen that these spiritual demons the old Roman Empire had raised up and it start killing off all those Jews you know y'all remember the holy CA well you got people who are now trying to explain that way and say it didn't happen I've been to Israel I've seen books I've been to Museum and everything else how could it not have had happened you know what I mean but you see he tells us that these demons was raised up he says 200 thousand Demons of persecution and notice what happened under the six uh uh uh under under the that six trumpet they were turned loose on the Jews the persecution of the Jews Supernatural Devils nearly 2,000 years then Loose by Stalin Hitler upon the Jews those demons were loosed by men and oh come on somebody y'all better recognize y'all day in this message because I'm going tell you something he said when when that war war and everything was over they all went by way of Hollywood they traveled to the west and from that point on America has been increasing they're now what they're doing the very same things Hitler they're mutating things they experimenting with things they doing all kinds of stuff trying to find life the same thing Hitler was doing here they're doing it in America and every everywhere else now you seeing horror through Hollywood and Hollywood is trying to tell you what hell looks like amen right and let me tell you something he goes on to say how insane the people will be in our day they're there the bride will be the only persons amen who will be uh uh have their sanity but everything is insane come on somebody it's true I remember the time that the wind blew and a woman was walking and her dress went up just a little bit below her knee she blush and shame be shamed come on y'all am I telling the truth now they just take it all off they don't care they don't even blush they look at you like you're crazy if you're staring at them but that's true I'm telling you sometime I think to myself how can it be but there are they're insane these are the Deep listen folks so you can understand these people possess demons and these demons are murderous demons and these demons that walk around here naked and everything else they're coming against you they haven't been loosed yet but they're occupying bodies right nowen just like those demons occupied bodies in Hitler's Day come on somebody but it took Hitler to Rally them to bring them together so will it be in this day amen and the prophet of God said what going to what's going to happen here in this time he said it be like a picnic he said he said the holy go holy cost would look like a picnic compared we have no idea yeah you say well I'm I'm going to make uh the Rapture before the tribulation I trust that's why we're working tonight trying to get us to believe and have faith that we will amen because if you ever left behind you in trouble you in trouble hello somebody but not one will be people say well you know you're looking at folks and I'm I'm wondering I'm thinking why is I'm why am I so excited and others are so excited and others are not something's wrong amen if you can't feel the pool that something's going on let oh yeah they've been talking about the r for a long time but brother say one of these old days you going to hear it for the last time that was the devil desensitizing the people let me read this last quote okay is that all right coming from Feast of the trumpet I want you to understand folks we we got something coming and we done been preaching this thing over and over but I'm going tell you something in my Christian walk I've been saved by the grace of God ever since I was what 19 years old and I'm going tell you something I I thought the Rapture was going to happen a year after I got saved but I'm going tell you something it's clearer now than it's ever been and I'm going tell you something in I never thought it could ever get this bad and it's not at its worst yet well what has he done in this cunningness as he said talking about the pope he'd come in like flatteries and what has he done he's bringing the Protestant e communal Council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist let me tell you something the bride the Rapture would take place in between the bunding of the wheat bunding of the systems right just before he and the uh appearing of the Antichrist if you here and the Antichrist appear you've missed it you missed it he bringing the Protestants at communal counsel of the world churches Spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just just like they did the others in the hour to to call the bride how loosed in the ecclesiastical Church Spirits loosed upon what not upon the denomination upon the bride but you hear but you he said but here you get it the bride will not go through that time the Bible says not the church will but the bride not the bride can you see it ministers can you see that Brethren you say the church has to go through the persecution uh for the Perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride that's why you got to get the Holy Ghost that is the life of the blood a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found Grace to her with her she's found Grace with him he's engaged to her and if there's anything he'll keep her from even uh every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride and so is it did on the bride we're unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it look at how many lost and blind how many Sinners was there in the world the hour I I got saved God saved me for a purpose here it is God saved me for a purpose and I'm determined by his will to do that purpose God saved you for a purpose and you ought to be determined by his will to do his purpose amen amen let's stand oh Jesus people people of God we were Shing sharing brother I said he don't care if you scream H snot all the way till he craw up your face he said you as long as you get it and
