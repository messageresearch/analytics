[47:48] was able to make it this
[47:50] afternoon uh it's been a while since we
[47:52] had had our youth meetings so we're
[47:54] hoping we're going to be able to do
[47:57] uh as much as we
[47:59] can uh before the winter
[48:02] starts anden in the Bible verse that we
[48:07] read Jesus was teaching the disciples
[48:09] how to pray it says you pray you say Our
[48:12] Father which are in heaven Hallowed be
[48:15] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[48:18] done on in Earth as it is in heaven so
[48:22] my um my title this afternoon will be an
[48:26] un written law which is choice so uh it
[48:31] will make sense as we go further down so
[48:34] the small topic we're talking about is
[48:38] an unwritten law
[48:41] choice I forgot to ask is there anyone
[48:43] who needs um
[48:48] translation
[48:50] okay Unwritten low and Unwritten low
[48:54] choice I have a couple of slides that I
[48:57] sent to the brothers over
[49:01] there that's where I put all my notes
[49:04] so um
[49:08] um depending on
[49:13] them we able to put it on the um on the
[49:23] tablet I mean so we speaking about
[49:26] choice this afternoon so when God
[49:28] created man he put a law and he gave
[49:32] each and every person an ability to
[49:34] choose when he put Adam and Eve in the
[49:37] garden he gave them what the prophet
[49:40] calls free moral
[49:42] agency which is every person you choose
[49:46] whatever you want to do you are given
[49:49] multiple options but it is up to you to
[49:52] select what you want God is a gentleman
[49:56] he does not force himself on you he does
[49:59] not force force his choice on you but he
[50:02] lets you select what you want and we see
[50:06] that in each and every day that we live
[50:09] we consciously and unconsciously make
[50:11] choices this morning when you wake up
[50:14] you went to your closet or wardrobe you
[50:17] had a lot of clothes unconsciously you
[50:19] made a choice you probably had a lot of
[50:22] shirts or a lot of dresses that you had
[50:25] but then you chose one one particular
[50:27] one and you say this is the one I want
[50:29] you are making a choice no one forced
[50:32] you to wear
[50:33] it this afternoon you probably ate some
[50:36] food you probably had a couple of
[50:38] options that you had but you went to
[50:40] select the exact food that you ate why
[50:44] unconsciously you made a decision to get
[50:46] what you got so we see that in our lives
[50:50] each and every day we have choices that
[50:53] we make so unconsciously and consciously
[50:57] and this is the law that God gave to
[50:59] each and every one of us when he created
[51:01] man when you walked in here this
[51:05] afternoon you had to make a choice where
[51:07] you wanted to sit you could have said
[51:09] there you could have sat there but you
[51:11] decided to sit in that seat why you made
[51:13] a choice
[51:16] amen but we realize and we thank God
[51:19] that we are children of God our choices
[51:22] that we make we make them by faith we
[51:25] make those choices is based on the
[51:28] word um the prophet of God in the
[51:32] choosing of a bride here says in many
[51:34] things of life we are given a choice
[51:38] that's the next slide
[51:40] please in many things of life we are
[51:43] given a
[51:51] choice the way of life itself is a
[51:54] choice we have a right to make our own
[51:57] way choose your own way that we want to
[52:01] live education is a choice we can choose
[52:05] whether we're going to be educated or
[52:07] whether we are not going to be
[52:13] educated education is a choice we can
[52:15] choose whether we're going to be
[52:16] educated or whether we are not going to
[52:19] be educated that's a choice that we have
[52:22] right and wrong is a choice every man
[52:25] every woman boy and girl has to choose
[52:28] whether they're going to try and leave
[52:31] right or not leave right it's a choice
[52:33] and he says choice is a great thing so
[52:37] wherever you are seated right now the
[52:39] condition that you are in it is because
[52:41] you made a
[52:43] choice if you go to school and you say I
[52:45] want to study accounting or you say I
[52:49] want to be a lawyer the day when you
[52:51] graduate and you stand and you get that
[52:53] code on it you just did not become a
[52:56] lawyer overnight you just did not wake
[52:58] up and became a doctor overnight but it
[53:01] is because of the choice you made a few
[53:03] years ago amen so wherever you are you
[53:07] are a product of the choices that you
[53:10] made amen and that's what prophet is
[53:12] telling us that choice is a great
[53:15] thing and says your Eternal destination
[53:19] is a
[53:20] choice and maybe tonight some of you
[53:22] will make that choice of where you will
[53:25] spend etern
[53:27] before this service ends tonight and
[53:30] there'll be one time that if you turn
[53:32] God down many time there'll be one time
[53:35] you turn him down the last time and he
[53:38] talking about the line between mercy and
[53:41] judgment amen so your Eternal
[53:43] destination where you are going to go
[53:46] when you move on from this life you have
[53:49] to Cho you have a choice to it whether
[53:51] you're going to hell or you're going to
[53:53] spend it in eternity that's a choice you
[53:55] have to make
[53:57] but remember each and every choice that
[53:59] you make it has a consequence you just
[54:02] don't choose and say oh I'm doing this
[54:04] and then go whichever way whatever you
[54:06] decide to do it has a replication it has
[54:09] a a consequence to it but here the
[54:11] prophet is telling us that even today
[54:14] you can make a choice of where you want
[54:15] to be in eternity you can choose if you
[54:19] want to be in Hell or if you want to go
[54:20] to heaven and he says one time you'll
[54:24] turn him down the last time and that's
[54:26] crossing the line between mercy and
[54:29] judgment says it is it's a dangerous
[54:32] thing for a man a woman boy or girl to
[54:36] step across that line for there is no
[54:39] return when you step across that
[54:42] deadline so that's the line of mercy and
[54:44] judgment in other messages the prophet
[54:47] is talking about you go to church each
[54:49] and every day you hear God calling out
[54:51] your name he is telling you to repent
[54:54] leave what you were doing but you said
[54:56] oh I'll do it next next um next
[55:00] Sunday you don't know tomorrow is not
[55:02] promised for you right you might leave
[55:04] out and this is your last Sunday you
[55:07] never know but that's a choice you're
[55:09] making and he's telling us you will
[55:11] cross that line of mercy and judgment
[55:14] and once you are gone there is no
[55:17] returning and once you have have crossed
[55:20] that line of Mercy there is no more
[55:22] Mercy for you you are done the prophet
[55:25] of God gives the this story of one um
[55:28] one preacher's daughter he went to this
[55:30] pre he went to this pastor's church and
[55:33] he was preaching and he was blasting on
[55:35] sin and when he came out this preacher
[55:38] the pastor's daughter came to me and
[55:39] says um my dad didn't hire you to come
[55:43] and preach this he says no your dad
[55:45] didn't hire me he invited me to come
[55:47] preach then he says what business did
[55:49] you have preaching all that
[55:51] nonsense and she was just fuming at
[55:54] him then they were in their separate
[55:57] ways within a year later after that the
[56:00] prophet of God was walking and this girl
[56:02] came up to him and she's saying oh do
[56:04] you want a cigarette do you want to do
[56:07] you want to
[56:08] smoke and he was wondering what's going
[56:10] on with this girl and the girl said do
[56:12] you remember me and then he said yes
[56:15] then she said that day when you told me
[56:18] when you rebuked me that's the day I
[56:20] cross the line and she says she was done
[56:25] and she told the prophet and said said
[56:27] this point in my life I can even see my
[56:29] mother's Soul frying in hell like a
[56:31] pancake and I don't even care she had
[56:35] crossed that line of mercy and
[56:38] judgment that day was her last day so
[56:41] you never know when that last day is
[56:44] going to be when you hear God calling
[56:47] out your heart he's calling you to give
[56:49] you for you to give him your life make
[56:52] sure you he to that call cuz you don't
[56:55] know where that line is you don't know
[56:58] when you are going to cross that line
[57:01] but also Satan tries to be slick he
[57:03] tries to come to you and tell you that
[57:04] you've already crossed it it's you
[57:07] already done deal and I was reading uh
[57:09] in question and aners the prophet of God
[57:11] someone came and said how do I know I
[57:13] haven't crossed the line of mercy and
[57:15] judgment yet he says so long you still
[57:17] feel the desire to serve the Lord you
[57:20] haven't crossed it yet so whenever Satan
[57:23] tries to come to lie to you you tell him
[57:25] you are a liar
[57:26] I'm still a child of God I'm still a Son
[57:29] of God I haven't crossed that line yet
[57:32] so no one force you to come here this
[57:35] evening no one forc you to go to church
[57:38] well I hope
[57:39] not but because you came here no matter
[57:42] how many battles you are fighting the
[57:45] slightest desire that you have is God
[57:47] tugging on your heart he wants you to
[57:50] serve him and he is telling you you
[57:52] haven't crossed that line yet because
[57:55] remember once you step across that line
[57:58] there is no turning back amen and he
[58:01] says so tonight it might be the time
[58:03] that many will make their decision where
[58:05] they will spend their endless
[58:09] eternity amen so you have to make a
[58:12] choice remember God gave each and every
[58:15] person free moral agency starting from
[58:18] when he created Adam and Eve he
[58:21] said you can choose either the tree of
[58:23] life or the tree of the knowledge and
[58:25] they make made their own choice although
[58:28] he wanted them to stay with the Tree of
[58:31] Life they made their own choice and he
[58:33] let them have it because remember God is
[58:35] a gentleman he is not going to force you
[58:38] but he will tell you what he wants for
[58:40] you because he is the one who created
[58:43] you so he has your user manual you know
[58:46] many of you when you buy when you buy a
[58:49] gadget or um uh an appliance or wherever
[58:52] from a store you have to go look and
[58:55] find the exact user manual and the user
[58:59] manual is created by the person who
[59:01] created this device why because they
[59:04] know how it functions from A to Z they
[59:08] are the ones that put it together so God
[59:12] is the one who created you he is the one
[59:15] who has your user manual you don't even
[59:18] know all of it so whenever you have any
[59:20] questions go to God and ask him Lord
[59:24] what do I need to do here because
[59:26] remember he is the one who put you
[59:27] together the Bible says you are
[59:29] wonderfully and fearfully made I know
[59:32] sisters love that verse say I am
[59:34] wonderfully and fearfully made while
[59:35] you're looking in the mirror there's
[59:37] nothing wrong with that amen cuz God
[59:40] created you in his own image and when he
[59:43] was creating you he had you on his mind
[59:46] and he created the best that he could
[59:48] cuz remember you are made in his own
[59:51] image amen and he created you for his
[59:55] own own pleasure many people they say
[59:58] why would God would just why would God
[1:00:01] just create people just to worship
[1:00:04] him they say oh so God is a narcissist
[1:00:08] he just wants to create people make them
[1:00:10] have problems and come and start healing
[1:00:12] them so that he gets all the glory you
[1:00:15] cannot take God and put him in a human
[1:00:18] mind and understand him the moment you
[1:00:21] understand God then he is no longer God
[1:00:24] am amen you are called only to believe
[1:00:28] amen so God created you and him for his
[1:00:32] pleasure he created you and me to
[1:00:34] worship Him Revelation says Thou Art
[1:00:38] Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and
[1:00:41] honor and power for thou has created all
[1:00:46] things he created the plants he created
[1:00:50] all the nagar Niagara foes he created
[1:00:53] the Grand Canyon all for his pleasure
[1:00:56] and he created you for his pleasure says
[1:01:00] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[1:01:03] created so whatever you do you are
[1:01:06] pleasing God Amen so whatever choice you
[1:01:10] are supposed to make remember first that
[1:01:13] God created me for his pleasure whatever
[1:01:16] I'm doing I'm supposed to please him and
[1:01:19] you as a Christian although you are
[1:01:22] given those different choices to make
[1:01:25] you are supposed to come to a place like
[1:01:26] Jesus and say not my will but your will
[1:01:30] be done cuz even though as all those
[1:01:32] options are there he is the one who
[1:01:34] created you he's the one who made you
[1:01:37] use a manual he knows which choice you
[1:01:39] need to make
[1:01:42] amen and he
[1:01:44] says there's another choice that we have
[1:01:46] to make uh in life that's a life's
[1:01:49] companion a young man or woman stepping
[1:01:53] out of life um has been given a right to
[1:01:57] to make a choice the young man chooses
[1:02:00] the young woman has a right to accept or
[1:02:02] reject it but it's still a choice on
[1:02:05] both sides so the man has to make a
[1:02:08] choice the woman has to make a choice
[1:02:11] both men and woman they have a right to
[1:02:13] make a choice that is a choice that God
[1:02:15] has given us the prophet is talking
[1:02:18] about the different choices that we have
[1:02:20] to make and it is totally up to you it
[1:02:23] says also you have a choice as a
[1:02:26] Christian you have a choice of the
[1:02:29] church here in America so far that you
[1:02:32] can go to that's your own American
[1:02:34] privilege to choose any church that you
[1:02:37] want to belong to God does not force you
[1:02:40] which church to go to you have your own
[1:02:42] choice you have to decide you have to
[1:02:44] make the choice to serve him he says
[1:02:48] that's a choice you don't want to go to
[1:02:51] any of them if you don't want to but if
[1:02:53] you want to change from the Methodist to
[1:02:55] the Baptist or the Catholic to a
[1:02:57] Protestant or so forth there's nobody
[1:03:00] can tell you or make you come to any
[1:03:02] certain church that's our freedom that's
[1:03:05] our democracy every man can choose for
[1:03:08] himself freedom of religion and there is
[1:03:12] a great thing God help us to keep it as
[1:03:15] long as we
[1:03:16] can there are so many religions in this
[1:03:20] world whatever you are looking for
[1:03:22] whatever you are thinking there's a
[1:03:23] religion that can fit that so you have a
[1:03:26] choice to make but you as a Christian
[1:03:30] you know where you came from and you
[1:03:32] know where you are going back to so you
[1:03:35] don't have to start thinking am I
[1:03:38] supposed to go with Buddhism am I
[1:03:40] supposed to go with a Muslim or what not
[1:03:43] because you know you are a Christian you
[1:03:45] were born again Hallelujah God gave you
[1:03:49] and called you to worship Him amen and
[1:03:51] the only way is through Christ so we
[1:03:55] thank God that we are Christians like
[1:03:58] the pastor was preaching earlier on
[1:03:59] before you can say I'm a message
[1:04:01] believer you are a Christian that's how
[1:04:03] you identify yourself
[1:04:05] as so you have to make that decision
[1:04:09] remember he says you have a choice to of
[1:04:11] the church that you want to go to but
[1:04:14] nowadays there is so much moral
[1:04:17] indecency people carrying on what and
[1:04:21] doing whatever they want to
[1:04:23] do but we're not like that we are
[1:04:26] different called we are called to be
[1:04:29] different we are called to be a chosen
[1:04:32] people amen and we want to be like
[1:04:35] Joshua when he was addressing the
[1:04:37] children of Israel he said and if it
[1:04:40] seem evil unto you to serve the Lord he
[1:04:43] says choose you this day whom you will
[1:04:46] serve whether you want to serve the gods
[1:04:48] of your fathers which are on the side of
[1:04:50] the flood there's a God of Abraham Isaac
[1:04:53] and Jacob or the gods of the amor
[1:04:56] in whose lands he dwell but he says but
[1:04:59] as for me in my house we will serve the
[1:05:02] Lord God is looking for someone to this
[1:05:05] evening he is looking for a witness
[1:05:08] someone who can say me in my house I
[1:05:11] will serve the Lord if you don't have a
[1:05:13] house you say as for me and myself I
[1:05:17] will serve the Lord it doesn't matter
[1:05:19] what the devil throws in out there but
[1:05:21] I'm going to stand for the word amen
[1:05:24] with so much tempt ations coming in
[1:05:27] especially more so to the young people
[1:05:29] the devil tries to attack the young
[1:05:31] people cuz if he attacks the young
[1:05:34] people there is no church
[1:05:36] tomorrow we are done so that's why all
[1:05:41] his targets the enemy is coming in with
[1:05:44] full
[1:05:45] force coming from all different angles
[1:05:49] you have movies is the more you watch
[1:05:52] those movies they're conditioning your
[1:05:54] mind
[1:05:56] you start thinking crazy probably the
[1:05:58] first time you were watching a movie and
[1:06:01] you saw a man and a man kissing you like
[1:06:04] e but then you kept on seeing it every
[1:06:06] day day after day now you look at it
[1:06:09] just like oh yeah it's going to pass why
[1:06:11] the devil is conditioning you and you
[1:06:12] are used to it when you walk out and you
[1:06:16] go out you see men kissing or two women
[1:06:19] kissing it's normal to you cuz Satan has
[1:06:22] already conditioned your mind and he
[1:06:24] ping out them music that you are
[1:06:27] listening to each and every
[1:06:29] day that's how they change culture
[1:06:32] through music through movies and all
[1:06:35] that and you are not even paying
[1:06:37] attention whilst you are driving you're
[1:06:39] just listening to it it's not just
[1:06:41] making you excited but it's ministering
[1:06:43] to your spirit and it's changing your
[1:06:46] filter it's it's making holes in your
[1:06:49] filter things that you used to not like
[1:06:51] you start liking them things that you
[1:06:54] used to never things that you never um
[1:06:57] used to tolerate you start tolerating
[1:06:59] them places you never used to go to you
[1:07:02] start going to why because Satan is
[1:07:04] conditioning you he's trying destroy you
[1:07:08] cuz he knows if he destroys you they is
[1:07:11] not future amen for any continuity
[1:07:16] anything that's happening there is
[1:07:18] always a training for a Next Generation
[1:07:21] go to sports when uh those athletes they
[1:07:24] about to get to the and they start
[1:07:26] training the Next Generation because if
[1:07:29] they don't train the Next Generation
[1:07:31] then it's done there is no future amen
[1:07:34] and God always has a witness in each and
[1:07:38] every age in each and every age he has a
[1:07:41] witness amen and I'm looking at God's
[1:07:44] witness this afternoon
[1:07:46] Hallelujah just turn around to your
[1:07:48] neighbor and say I am God's witness of
[1:07:53] lodia Amen
[1:07:56] the prophet God says you have also a
[1:08:00] choice whether you choose this church
[1:08:03] you can choose whether you in this
[1:08:05] church whether you will choose a church
[1:08:07] that will guide you to your Eternal
[1:08:09] destination you can choose a church that
[1:08:12] has a certain Creed that you might think
[1:08:15] that Creed is what you want or the other
[1:08:17] church has their Creed and then they is
[1:08:20] the word of God you have a choice you
[1:08:23] have to make the choice and say there is
[1:08:25] an unwritten law Among Us the law of
[1:08:29] choosing which is our our um subject
[1:08:32] this afternoon the law the UN written
[1:08:35] law Among Us of choice amen says you can
[1:08:39] choose a church where you want to go to
[1:08:42] the prophet of God says before you
[1:08:43] choose a church of where you want to go
[1:08:45] to you have to
[1:08:47] pray cuz that's where your soul is being
[1:08:50] fed amen you might buy you you you
[1:08:54] clothe your body with with expensive
[1:08:56] clothes and um you're feeded with a
[1:08:59] really good food but you don't care
[1:09:00] what's coming in your soul before you do
[1:09:04] anything you have to make sure that
[1:09:07] whatever is feeding your soul is the
[1:09:09] unadulterated pure word of God that is
[1:09:13] coming into your heart amen so I thank
[1:09:16] God for our pastors cuz God says I will
[1:09:20] give you Shepherds after mine own heart
[1:09:23] amen and we thank God for our pastor
[1:09:27] always preaching the true unadulterated
[1:09:29] word of God Amen and I will stand here I
[1:09:33] remember the first time I came here um I
[1:09:36] sat in brother Brooks's office and he
[1:09:39] was he were just getting to know each
[1:09:40] other and getting acquain he says
[1:09:42] brother me I just preach the word and he
[1:09:45] says I just preach what the prophet
[1:09:48] preached and he
[1:09:51] said
[1:09:53] that I preach the prophet so when he say
[1:09:56] that I said I was in a good
[1:10:00] place I knew I wasn't lost that's when I
[1:10:04] made my decision and I said I will stay
[1:10:07] in this church cuz many people nowadays
[1:10:09] in different churches they will say oh
[1:10:11] yeah the prophet say this but um well
[1:10:14] that was you know that's that was
[1:10:16] whatever I'll go with this and people
[1:10:18] say yeah I know why the prophet says I
[1:10:20] know why the word of God says but my
[1:10:22] pastor says this your pastor is supposed
[1:10:25] to follow the prophet what the prophet
[1:10:29] says because remember God reveals the
[1:10:32] will of any age to one man that's right
[1:10:35] it's a onean Ministry and when he
[1:10:38] reveals that word to one man which is
[1:10:41] the prophet of a dispensation then each
[1:10:44] and every one of us are called to
[1:10:46] participate in God's will amen so
[1:10:50] whatever Church you are going to
[1:10:52] wherever you are make sure that you are
[1:10:54] listen listening to the unadulterated
[1:10:56] word of
[1:10:58] God
[1:10:59] Amen when you come to church that's
[1:11:02] where God speak you from this Pulpit
[1:11:05] life is preached or death can also be
[1:11:07] preached from the pulpit every time you
[1:11:10] pray and you say Lord please speak to me
[1:11:13] and then you come to church God will
[1:11:15] speak to you from the pulpit have you
[1:11:17] ever come from home and you say Lord I
[1:11:19] don't understand this and then you come
[1:11:21] you didn't have a conversation with the
[1:11:23] preacher for that day and then he goes
[1:11:25] right into your life what is happening
[1:11:29] God is speaking to you God is answering
[1:11:32] your prayer amen so make sure when you
[1:11:36] before you you go to church you say Lord
[1:11:39] speak to me Lord answer my prayer and
[1:11:43] every time you come to church you are
[1:11:45] comparing your life with the mirror of
[1:11:48] the word of the Lord if there's anything
[1:11:51] that's a miss you recalibrate yourself
[1:11:54] so that you can fit exactly in the word
[1:11:56] because remember we are being built into
[1:11:59] the St of a perfect man we are not
[1:12:02] perfect but we keep on coming because he
[1:12:04] gave us a promise that he will make us
[1:12:07] perfect we are not perfect in our own
[1:12:09] accord but we are perfect in him so we
[1:12:12] start out with
[1:12:14] faith you don't have enough faith for
[1:12:17] the for the healing of a of of a
[1:12:18] headache but you keep on praying you
[1:12:21] keep on coming to church every day you
[1:12:23] keep on listening to that word then you
[1:12:25] start seeing yourself getting victory
[1:12:28] victory after Victory why you're being
[1:12:30] built into the stat of a perfect man
[1:12:33] then you see yourself climbing up that
[1:12:35] ladder you find yourself you have virtue
[1:12:38] you get to knowledge Temperance patience
[1:12:42] all the way to the Holy Ghost where you
[1:12:44] are why because that's where the word is
[1:12:48] being preached into your life amen so we
[1:12:52] thank God for free moral agency
[1:12:55] amen and the choice that he gave us and
[1:12:58] remember your flesh will never choose
[1:13:01] the word of God that beastly nature will
[1:13:04] never want things of the word it always
[1:13:07] wants to go right against it so before
[1:13:10] you can choose you have to choose by
[1:13:13] Faith remember faith is a revelation a
[1:13:16] revelation of the word so before you
[1:13:19] make any choice you got to pray Lord I'm
[1:13:23] about to make this decision please guide
[1:13:25] me remember that scripture that says
[1:13:28] consider the Lord in all your ways not
[1:13:31] some of your ways but consider the Lord
[1:13:34] in all your ways whatever decision
[1:13:37] you're about to make consider the Lord
[1:13:40] and when you consider him in all your
[1:13:42] ways he will direct your paths wherever
[1:13:45] you go before you make any decision you
[1:13:48] say Lord please guide me in today
[1:13:51] decisions I have to make at school
[1:13:53] decisions I have to make at work please
[1:13:55] guide me and he will direct your paths
[1:13:58] and that's a choice you have to make you
[1:14:01] don't have to consider him if you don't
[1:14:02] want to because remember you have free
[1:14:04] moral agency
[1:14:07] amen Deuteronomy 30 says I call Heaven
[1:14:10] and Earth to record this day against you
[1:14:14] that I have set before you life and
[1:14:17] death blessing and cursing those are
[1:14:20] choices life and death blessing and
[1:14:24] cursing
[1:14:25] but then he comes and he say tells you
[1:14:28] therefore choose life that both you and
[1:14:31] thy seed may live amen so you have a
[1:14:35] choice of life and there's a choice of
[1:14:38] death there's a choice of a blessing and
[1:14:40] the choice of a cursing but whatever
[1:14:43] choice you have that is the consequence
[1:14:46] of it the choice that you make can lead
[1:14:48] you to have eternal life choosing to
[1:14:50] serve the Lord will give you eternal
[1:14:52] life choosing to reject it that's
[1:14:55] choosing death that's choosing a curse
[1:14:58] to your life amen so choose life that
[1:15:02] both you and thy seed might
[1:15:06] leave and
[1:15:08] remember wherever you are seated right
[1:15:10] now you are a product of the decisions
[1:15:13] you
[1:15:14] made the prophet of God
[1:15:17] says you are today what you are because
[1:15:20] several years ago you chose to be what
[1:15:23] you are now
[1:15:25] what you choose now will determine what
[1:15:28] you will be 5 years from today so right
[1:15:32] now where you are you are because of the
[1:15:35] choice you made five years ago and he
[1:15:38] says 5 years from today you may be a
[1:15:42] missionary 5 years from today you may be
[1:15:45] a renowned Christian or 5 years from
[1:15:48] today you may be in hell because you
[1:15:51] made the wrong
[1:15:53] decision 5 Years From today you may be
[1:15:56] cleaning spits in a barroom 5 years from
[1:16:00] today you may be a prostitute on the
[1:16:03] streets and he is preaching in his
[1:16:06] church he says or you may be a man or a
[1:16:09] woman that's a credit to any society
[1:16:13] because of your choice for
[1:16:15] Christ 5 years from today you may be in
[1:16:19] glory going in the Rapture because of
[1:16:22] the choice you made today amen
[1:16:25] amen so God is a gentleman he allows you
[1:16:29] to make whatever choice you make but
[1:16:31] remember whatever choice you going to
[1:16:33] make where you are seated right now 5
[1:16:36] years from now that's where you will
[1:16:40] be if you decided whilst you were going
[1:16:43] to school and you say I don't want to I
[1:16:45] don't want to finish this no more you
[1:16:48] leave 5 years from then on you will
[1:16:51] still remain ungraduated because of the
[1:16:53] decision you made
[1:16:55] so whatever decision you make is going
[1:16:57] to compound and give you the result of
[1:17:00] where you were going to and he says the
[1:17:04] word God says and God gives you a choice
[1:17:07] says choose you this day who you will
[1:17:10] serve in the Garden of Eden there was a
[1:17:13] tree of knowledge and a tree of life man
[1:17:16] was given the privilege to choose either
[1:17:19] one he desired and so is it today you
[1:17:24] were given Your Privilege as free moral
[1:17:27] agents to choose whatever you want to
[1:17:31] choose he says my advice to
[1:17:34] you
[1:17:36] advice is a choice you don't have to
[1:17:40] take it if you don't want to if someone
[1:17:42] comes to you and say hey I want to give
[1:17:44] you advice you like yeah sure then they
[1:17:46] tell you but as soon as they tell you
[1:17:49] you can walk and say yeah I have a
[1:17:50] choice to take your advice or to leave
[1:17:54] it is that
[1:17:56] right but here the prophet of God saying
[1:17:59] my advice to you don't look at the
[1:18:02] Modern things around you and remember
[1:18:05] when the prophet is is advising you you
[1:18:08] have to take it because he is seeing he
[1:18:11] is a
[1:18:13] Seer a Seer sits on a higher place than
[1:18:17] each and every one of us so he sees
[1:18:20] what's coming and you don't but you
[1:18:23] still have that choice to take it
[1:18:25] there's a lot of things we are talking
[1:18:27] to people they say yeah those was those
[1:18:30] was his thoughts you know you can do
[1:18:32] whatever you want that's up to you
[1:18:34] that's a choice you have to make but I
[1:18:37] know Faith looks at the word faith looks
[1:18:40] at What God Says and remember the
[1:18:42] prophet of God is a mouthpiece to you
[1:18:44] and me amen he says my advice to you is
[1:18:47] don't look at the mod things around you
[1:18:50] and the popularity and the glamour that
[1:18:52] you could be but choose rather
[1:18:55] by faith him that give the promise that
[1:18:59] someday he will come and will Wren all
[1:19:02] the
[1:19:02] wrongs amen and you got to choose don't
[1:19:07] look at what you see because remember
[1:19:09] your
[1:19:10] eyes never rely on them you rely your
[1:19:14] eyes are part of your flesh they will
[1:19:16] choose something that's contrary to the
[1:19:18] word of God he says choose what you see
[1:19:21] by faith not by your eyes that's the
[1:19:24] only only thing that will count is what
[1:19:26] you choose by faith lot as he he had to
[1:19:30] make a choice Abraham gave lot a choice
[1:19:33] their her men were having
[1:19:36] issues and Abraham said Lord listen we
[1:19:38] have to we have to part ways but you
[1:19:41] make a choice where do you want to go
[1:19:43] wherever you go I'm not go I'll go the
[1:19:45] opposite direction and he let him make
[1:19:48] the choice and remember the promise and
[1:19:50] the call was on Abraham and not on lot
[1:19:53] Abraham was always waiting on thus says
[1:19:55] the Lord that's the same thing that the
[1:19:58] Sons and Daughters of Abraham do you
[1:20:00] wait on thus says the Lord you wait on
[1:20:03] what the Lord says you should do and
[1:20:06] what did lot do he chose using his eyes
[1:20:09] he saw Sodom and
[1:20:11] gomorah the pastures were green they had
[1:20:13] a good life and he said that's where I'm
[1:20:16] going but what did his choice leading to
[1:20:19] he didn't know that his choice was going
[1:20:22] to lead to his wife turning into a
[1:20:25] pillar of salt he didn't see that he was
[1:20:29] just looking at what was right in front
[1:20:31] of him but if he had prayed God was
[1:20:34] probably going to show him something
[1:20:35] different Abraham was not choosing that
[1:20:38] he was standing on thus says the Lord
[1:20:41] and he stayed on the land God promised
[1:20:43] him and when you stand on that says the
[1:20:45] Lord God will give you the promises that
[1:20:48] he promised
[1:20:50] you Lord didn't know that he is going to
[1:20:53] end up fathering his daughter's
[1:20:56] children he did that and went by sight
[1:21:00] because he was not following the word
[1:21:03] but the prophet of God says choose what
[1:21:05] you see by faith and that's the only
[1:21:08] thing that count not what you see by
[1:21:10] your own eyes
[1:21:15] Amen in um Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 the
[1:21:20] bible says ask and it shall be given to
[1:21:23] you seek and you shall find knock and it
[1:21:28] shall be open to you for everyone that
[1:21:31] seeketh asketh
[1:21:33] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[1:21:36] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[1:21:40] open and it says oh what man is there of
[1:21:43] you whom if his son ask for bread he
[1:21:46] will give him a stone or if he ask a
[1:21:49] fish he will give him a
[1:21:52] serpent if ye be then being evil know
[1:21:55] how to give good gifts unto your
[1:21:58] children how much more shall your father
[1:22:01] which is in heaven give good things to
[1:22:04] them that ask him remember God gives you
[1:22:07] the desires of your heart he says ask
[1:22:09] what you shall want and he will give it
[1:22:11] to
[1:22:12] you even if it's not his perfect he will
[1:22:15] give it to you he will allow you his
[1:22:18] permissive will cuz remember he gave a
[1:22:21] choice and he's a go God who keeps his
[1:22:24] promise is here the prophet of God says
[1:22:27] but he will give you the desire of his
[1:22:29] your heart he promised that you know
[1:22:33] that he promised to give you the desire
[1:22:35] of your heart and let your desire be the
[1:22:38] word of God let your desire be his
[1:22:43] will I've always read uh this scripture
[1:22:46] that um he gives you he gives me the
[1:22:50] desires of my heart and the way I've
[1:22:52] always seen it is he gives me what my
[1:22:55] heart wants but he gives you the desires
[1:22:59] of your heart which means he gives your
[1:23:02] heart what to desire that's why you have
[1:23:05] to surrender your will to him so he
[1:23:07] gives your heart what to desire and then
[1:23:10] he gives you what you are
[1:23:12] Desiring amen that's what it that's what
[1:23:15] it ought to be let your will be done not
[1:23:20] mine so you are allowing God to pour His
[1:23:24] desire is into your heart cuz when you
[1:23:27] are pursuing God's desire you are
[1:23:29] pursuing a greater purpose in his will
[1:23:33] remember when Hannah was praying she was
[1:23:35] praying for a baby
[1:23:37] boy to her she thought she was just
[1:23:40] praying for her heart's desires but she
[1:23:42] didn't know God was using her as a
[1:23:45] channel to bring an answer to the whole
[1:23:47] nation so in her small mind she was just
[1:23:51] receiving a baby boy but in God's Grand
[1:23:54] scheme of things she was praying for the
[1:23:57] prophet Samuel whom God was going to
[1:23:59] give to him so when you pray you say
[1:24:02] Lord give me what to desire because you
[1:24:06] know what I need and you are the one who
[1:24:09] has my use Emmanuel remember he says in
[1:24:12] his word I know the thoughts that I have
[1:24:15] for
[1:24:15] you thoughts for you to prosper not
[1:24:19] thoughts for you to suffer so let your
[1:24:22] desire be the word of God
[1:24:25] let your desire be his will never your
[1:24:28] own will his will you ask him for
[1:24:32] something you don't give it to you you
[1:24:35] say Thank You Lord you know what's good
[1:24:38] if your
[1:24:40] son or if your child goes to their
[1:24:43] parents and say hey can you buy me a gun
[1:24:44] are you going to are they going to buy
[1:24:46] him no you're not going to give it to
[1:24:48] them why because they're going to hurt
[1:24:50] themselves or they're going to shoot
[1:24:52] somebody with that gun but to them is
[1:24:54] saying my parents don't want me to get a
[1:24:56] gun but the parents know what's
[1:24:59] better so when God does not give you
[1:25:03] some things that you saying you want you
[1:25:05] got to thank him because he knows why
[1:25:07] He's not giving you so instead of
[1:25:10] shouting and praising God only for the
[1:25:13] open doors you got to thank him for the
[1:25:16] closed doors as well because you Lord
[1:25:19] you knew that if I was going to go into
[1:25:21] this door I wouldn't be where I am today
[1:25:24] and some doors are trap doors you get in
[1:25:26] thinking it's an opportunity but you
[1:25:28] don't know what's laying behind so
[1:25:31] that's why you got to keep yourself
[1:25:34] consecrated sensitive to what God is
[1:25:37] telling you because his will is what's
[1:25:41] best for you it might not be good to you
[1:25:45] but it's good for
[1:25:48] you he created you he knows exactly what
[1:25:51] you
[1:25:52] want we all know of him
[1:25:55] Hezekiah
[1:25:58] Hezekiah his time had come to an end and
[1:26:01] God sent the prophet to Hezekiah and say
[1:26:04] go tell him to put his house in order
[1:26:07] because he is
[1:26:09] done his time has come to an end he's
[1:26:12] about to
[1:26:13] die and as soon as the prophet delivered
[1:26:17] the word to King Hezekiah he turned
[1:26:20] around and started leaving immediately
[1:26:24] Hezekiah knelled down and started
[1:26:26] praying he said Lord you know I've been
[1:26:29] so good to you please give me more time
[1:26:32] to live I just need more time and God
[1:26:38] because he is a just God remember if you
[1:26:40] ask what you desire he is going to give
[1:26:43] it to you even if it's not your his
[1:26:45] perfect will and remember he will give
[1:26:48] it to you even if it's his permissive
[1:26:51] will in God's perfect will Hezekiah was
[1:26:55] supposed to die his time on Earth was
[1:26:58] done but because he was stubborn he
[1:27:01] thought he knew better what was good for
[1:27:03] him he knelled down and he pray says
[1:27:05] Lord you know how I've been good to you
[1:27:08] how I've lived a holy life and clean
[1:27:10] life for you please give me more time
[1:27:13] and whilst the prophet was walking out
[1:27:16] God sent the prophet go back tell
[1:27:19] Hezekiah I've given him more
[1:27:21] time then the prophet he's just a
[1:27:24] mouthpiece he doesn't know what's going
[1:27:25] on he turns around he goes and tells
[1:27:27] Hezekiah God has had your prayer he has
[1:27:30] added 15 more years to your life but
[1:27:33] what happened that was not God's perfect
[1:27:36] will it was God's permissive will in
[1:27:39] those 15 years he undid all the good
[1:27:42] that he had done and he ended up dying a
[1:27:44] sinner the prophet of God here says
[1:27:46] Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and
[1:27:48] wept bitterly and said Lord God I ask
[1:27:52] you to consider me I've walked before
[1:27:54] you with a perfect heart I want you to
[1:27:57] let me live 15 years
[1:28:00] longer all right God spoke to the
[1:28:03] prophet said go back and tell him I
[1:28:05] heard him and what did he do he brought
[1:28:08] his grace upon the whole nation he
[1:28:11] kindled the anger of God until he would
[1:28:13] have killed him that's right you know
[1:28:16] that backs sad on God it would have been
[1:28:20] far better on off the nation for the
[1:28:22] king and all if he had went
[1:28:25] on and took God's first thing to him he
[1:28:29] should have died when God wanted him to
[1:28:32] die so you don't know what's better for
[1:28:35] you more than God is God knows so when
[1:28:38] you are
[1:28:39] praying many times we pray we're just so
[1:28:41] stubborn Lord I want this just give it
[1:28:43] to me that's what I want but when you
[1:28:46] mature in Christ and you know that you
[1:28:48] are supposed to pray for God's will you
[1:28:51] said Lord if this is your will for me to
[1:28:54] have this please may I have
[1:28:57] it and if it is if it is in his will he
[1:29:01] will give it to you if it's
[1:29:03] not he won't give it to you you pray
[1:29:06] people pray and say I want this I want
[1:29:08] that materialistic things sometimes God
[1:29:11] does not give it to you because he knows
[1:29:13] that the moment he gives it to you you
[1:29:16] stop serving him you stop coming to
[1:29:20] church and you are a Gunner and remember
[1:29:22] he said all that you you have given to
[1:29:24] me I have lost none of them so he knows
[1:29:28] what to give you to keep you and he
[1:29:30] knows that if I give this person that
[1:29:32] thing they are gone and remember the
[1:29:36] Bible always uses and calls us sheep in
[1:29:39] the
[1:29:40] Bible sheep are meant to be
[1:29:43] L sheep don't have a will of their own
[1:29:47] amen so they follow the shepherd so when
[1:29:50] the Bible calls you and me sheep it
[1:29:53] means the shepherd and we have the only
[1:29:57] one and great Shepherd Jesus Christ so
[1:30:00] sheep don't follow their own will you
[1:30:03] can compare goats and sheep a goat will
[1:30:06] run all over the place when you're
[1:30:09] trying to kill a goat you have to tie it
[1:30:10] up because it's not going to die it will
[1:30:12] run away but if you try to do the same
[1:30:15] thing to a sheep it's just going to
[1:30:16] stand right there it does not have a
[1:30:19] will of its own you and me as sheep the
[1:30:23] Lord our God is our Shepherd we are
[1:30:26] supposed to look for each and every time
[1:30:29] for his choice in our lives before you
[1:30:32] do anything you say Lord I'm your ship
[1:30:35] oh thou great Shepherd guide me to where
[1:30:38] I'm supposed to go give me that which
[1:30:41] I'm supposed to have because his will is
[1:30:45] what's best for you the prophet God says
[1:30:48] it's best to have God's
[1:30:49] will that's what he taught us thy will
[1:30:53] be done
[1:30:54] thy kingdom come thy will be done we
[1:30:58] must submit ourselves to his will and
[1:31:00] his word don't question it believe it
[1:31:04] don't try to find a way around it just
[1:31:08] take it the way it is Hezekiah tried to
[1:31:11] find a way around thus says the Lord and
[1:31:14] look at where it
[1:31:15] ended him he ended up dying a sinner so
[1:31:20] many want to go around get some other
[1:31:22] way and when you do you find yourself
[1:31:25] going on you find God blessing
[1:31:28] you but you are working his permissive
[1:31:30] will you think that God is blessing you
[1:31:34] you think that's an approval from God he
[1:31:36] is blessing you because it's his
[1:31:38] permissive will the only true test there
[1:31:41] is is the word test are you aligning
[1:31:44] with the word of God are you in God's
[1:31:47] will he says you are working in his
[1:31:50] permissive will and not in his perfect
[1:31:53] Divine
[1:31:54] will amen so we have to make sure that
[1:31:59] we are always in God's Will and when you
[1:32:03] are praying you say Lord answer my
[1:32:05] prayer according to your
[1:32:09] will in this next quote the prophet of
[1:32:12] God says do you know what 86% of
[1:32:15] conversions to Jesus Christ is done
[1:32:17] before 21 years old it shows its
[1:32:21] statistics 86%
[1:32:24] that come to Christ come before they
[1:32:27] 21 how many are under
[1:32:31] 21 no you're not how many are under 21
[1:32:35] how many are over
[1:32:36] 21 those who were over 21 God delivered
[1:32:41] you and he says after you pass that age
[1:32:45] you become more molded or set in your
[1:32:48] ways oh it's possible sure they come 70
[1:32:53] 80 years years old but it's very rare
[1:32:55] it's possible people can convert when
[1:32:58] they are 7 years old but it's rare so
[1:33:01] don't let Satan start telling you that
[1:33:03] it's you are too young to serve the Lord
[1:33:07] or you are too young enjoy life first
[1:33:09] then after you enjoy life then you can
[1:33:12] give your heart to God whilst you are
[1:33:15] enjoying your life you're going to get
[1:33:16] set in those ways and once you get past
[1:33:19] 21 it's hard for you to get back you
[1:33:22] cannot so so whilst today is today and
[1:33:25] tomorrow is not promised give your heart
[1:33:28] to him and serve him all the best you
[1:33:31] can cuz who told you what if whilst you
[1:33:34] are still enjoying you pass the line of
[1:33:36] judgment and mercy and there's a you get
[1:33:39] to a point of no
[1:33:41] return He says you make yourself when
[1:33:45] you are young you said Ambitions to what
[1:33:49] you want to do and what you are trying
[1:33:52] to achieve in life you make yourself
[1:33:54] when you were young the decision that
[1:33:57] you make today is what you are going to
[1:34:00] be many years later from now so that's
[1:34:03] why when you are making that
[1:34:05] choice you have to make sure that God is
[1:34:08] leading you look at the Rich Young
[1:34:12] Ruler God gave him a choice come follow
[1:34:16] me then he decides like yeah no I'm not
[1:34:18] going to sell my riches I'll I'll stay
[1:34:21] like this and Jesus looked at him and he
[1:34:23] he loved him because he was he was a
[1:34:25] good man he followed the word to the tea
[1:34:29] but then he
[1:34:30] refused God's choice Jesus choice for
[1:34:33] him and he says I don't want that choice
[1:34:35] I want this choice for myself and luk
[1:34:38] many years later where was he he was in
[1:34:41] the pit of Hell because he did not
[1:34:44] follow Jesus Choice God's Preferred
[1:34:47] Choice for him says you set Ambitions to
[1:34:50] what you want to do and what you're
[1:34:52] trying to achieve in life life even
[1:34:55] Ambitions you have career-wise you make
[1:34:58] the choice that you make right now
[1:35:00] that's where you are going you think of
[1:35:03] it and as you think of course your mind
[1:35:06] it's presented into your mind by an
[1:35:08] unknown something that dominates your
[1:35:11] mind and then when it becomes in your
[1:35:14] mind you speak it that you're going to
[1:35:18] do it and then your Ambitions drive you
[1:35:21] to it it doesn't mean that if if you are
[1:35:24] a Christian you have to be
[1:35:26] unambitious it's okay to be ambitious so
[1:35:29] long you put your priorities right
[1:35:32] remember the Bible says seek ye first
[1:35:33] the kingdom of God and everything else
[1:35:36] will be added to you so it's okay to be
[1:35:39] ambitious it's okay to want to have a
[1:35:42] good career it's okay to want to make a
[1:35:44] lot of money so long that you are not
[1:35:46] putting that money in front of God Amen
[1:35:49] you have to put God first in each and
[1:35:52] everything and then he will lead you
[1:35:54] into whatever that will follow and
[1:35:57] whatever he
[1:35:59] wants
[1:36:01] and God chose you before the foundation
[1:36:04] of the world he made a choice and he
[1:36:08] predestinated you to say this is my son
[1:36:12] this is my daughter you are seated there
[1:36:15] right now where you are because God
[1:36:17] predestinated you you probably didn't
[1:36:20] know how you were going to make it to
[1:36:22] where you are but because of his
[1:36:24] predestination it is holding you where
[1:36:26] you are right
[1:36:27] now your very existence on on this Earth
[1:36:32] was predestination I'll read this quote
[1:36:35] here the prophet of God here says
[1:36:38] remember what I said the other day at
[1:36:39] breakfast uh in the pollen of breeding
[1:36:42] male and female these million germs come
[1:36:45] forth million eggs go forth but there's
[1:36:48] only one of them leave and yet they are
[1:36:52] everyone just just alike one out of a
[1:36:55] million you were one out of a million
[1:36:58] but God chose you why he picked you and
[1:37:03] he said this is my son and he said this
[1:37:06] is my daughter it's not because you were
[1:37:08] any special but because he chose you so
[1:37:12] your life is not in you are not in
[1:37:15] control of your life God is in control
[1:37:17] of your life amen so when you need an
[1:37:20] answer to anything go to the one who
[1:37:22] chose you you say Lord you know what you
[1:37:24] brought me on this Earth for you know
[1:37:26] what my will is it says every one of
[1:37:29] them the same egg the same kind of germ
[1:37:32] one of them lives and the rest of them
[1:37:35] die no one can tell which is the one
[1:37:39] that's ripe egg what about it God has to
[1:37:43] decide that whether it's going to be a
[1:37:45] boy or a girl blond a brunette or
[1:37:48] whatever is going to be God decides that
[1:37:51] not the not that is going to be the
[1:37:53] first one but the first one that God has
[1:37:56] to decide so God decided you and he
[1:38:00] chose you that you are going to be on
[1:38:03] this Earth at this time to fulfill his
[1:38:07] will amen and when he puts you on an
[1:38:11] earth he puts you on the earth for this
[1:38:13] specific time he wants you to
[1:38:15] participate in his
[1:38:17] will remember the word of
[1:38:20] God the whole Bible is the word of God
[1:38:23] but but the will of God is the word of
[1:38:26] God for your day amen go into an ark is
[1:38:32] the word of God but going to a physical
[1:38:35] Ark today is not the will of God if you
[1:38:39] go build and I can you go then you'll be
[1:38:41] destroyed because that's not the will of
[1:38:43] God for today and God sends a profit in
[1:38:47] each and every dispensation to pick the
[1:38:50] will of God and reveal it to the people
[1:38:54] so that you and I we can participate in
[1:38:58] that will what God has intended for us
[1:39:03] and since he is the great Shepherd we
[1:39:05] say Lord lead us into your will reveal
[1:39:09] that word to us and then when it's
[1:39:11] revealed to you you live it remember
[1:39:14] Revelation says the bride has made
[1:39:16] herself ready ready with what ready with
[1:39:19] the word what word the word that was
[1:39:22] revealed in that day amen remember God
[1:39:25] will do nothing but reveal his secrets
[1:39:29] to His prophets and his secrets are his
[1:39:31] thoughts and he says his thoughts are
[1:39:34] good for you amen so when the prophets
[1:39:37] reveals the secrets of the thoughts of
[1:39:40] God he's there revealing what God wants
[1:39:43] you to do amen so everyone who is called
[1:39:48] under any age or any dispensation they
[1:39:52] have to follow the prophet or follow the
[1:39:54] word for their day that's the will of
[1:39:57] God for your day amen he says
[1:40:02] um okay I'll skip that
[1:40:05] one um I'm going to wind down and come
[1:40:08] to an
[1:40:09] end so each and every choice that you
[1:40:12] make it has a replication each and every
[1:40:15] choice that you make it has a
[1:40:16] consequence you just don't go around and
[1:40:20] do stuff and don't have any consequences
[1:40:23] to to
[1:40:25] that
[1:40:27] Moses made a
[1:40:30] choice when he looked outside the window
[1:40:32] he saw
[1:40:33] slaves but he saw beyond that and he saw
[1:40:37] children of God that had a promise when
[1:40:41] Pharaoh looked out this very same window
[1:40:45] he saw slaves that were working but
[1:40:48] because Moses was a prophet he was given
[1:40:52] a different eyesight
[1:40:54] remember your point of view is
[1:40:56] determined by where you are
[1:40:59] seated and where you are
[1:41:02] seated that's how you see so if you are
[1:41:05] seated higher you are going to see
[1:41:07] further that's why you have to trust in
[1:41:10] God you see to the corner God sees
[1:41:13] behind the corner you see just till
[1:41:16] today God sees
[1:41:18] tomorrow so that's why when he is
[1:41:21] choosing a will for you when he is
[1:41:23] choosing for you you take his choice not
[1:41:26] yours because you are not seeing what's
[1:41:29] coming your way
[1:41:31] amen when Jesus was walking with the
[1:41:33] disciples he told them he says oh
[1:41:35] Lazarus is sleeping and they says oh if
[1:41:38] he's sleeping then he's going to wake up
[1:41:41] but he realized no no no they don't
[1:41:43] understand what they talking about what
[1:41:44] what what he meant why because they were
[1:41:47] seated in a different place Jesus was SE
[1:41:49] on a higher place he was seeing that
[1:41:51] death as sleeping
[1:41:54] but the disciples they would see it as
[1:41:56] death then he had to explain and say no
[1:41:58] he is dead that's was like oh he is dead
[1:42:01] then let us go right now but he said no
[1:42:03] let us keep on going why he was seeing
[1:42:06] differently he was seeing tomorrow he
[1:42:08] was seeing Lazarus resurrecting so Jesus
[1:42:13] sees further than you do remember but
[1:42:16] when you are a Christian and you take
[1:42:19] his will for you then you Paul says we
[1:42:22] are seated in heaven places and you can
[1:42:24] see what the word wants for you Moses
[1:42:29] saw children of God he saw people who
[1:42:32] were supposed to claim and take all the
[1:42:36] promises and the choice that he made he
[1:42:39] could have made a choice to be called
[1:42:42] the son of pharaoh but he says no I'm
[1:42:44] I'll be identified with the slaves cuz
[1:42:46] he was seeing further and because of the
[1:42:48] decision he he made 800 years later he
[1:42:52] was seen on Mount
[1:42:54] Transfiguration because of the choice he
[1:42:56] made if he hadn't made that choice he
[1:42:58] was just going to be dead and gone and
[1:43:01] we'll look at one more
[1:43:03] example William brandham made a
[1:43:06] choice to he to God's call and
[1:43:10] because of the choice that he made the
[1:43:14] choice had a replication to it and we
[1:43:17] are all seated here because a man heeded
[1:43:20] to God's
[1:43:21] call and because he heed to God's call
[1:43:25] God said I'm going to give you a reward
[1:43:28] for taking my choice so when you take a
[1:43:32] choice God has a reward for
[1:43:34] you in this quote the prophet of
[1:43:38] God he speaks
[1:43:41] about this man who so um he started
[1:43:46] prophesying he says I had just got
[1:43:48] through speaking of a great powerful
[1:43:51] forceful statements that even the
[1:43:54] overseer one of the general overseers of
[1:43:55] the Assemblies of God stepped down to
[1:43:57] the platform from up in the balcony
[1:44:00] where he was sitting and says I don't
[1:44:01] believe brother brandham meant that he
[1:44:03] says I said I have to mean it sir it's
[1:44:07] thus says the Lord and then it was about
[1:44:10] the church in this
[1:44:12] age it was thus says the Lord about the
[1:44:15] church in this age and he was not taking
[1:44:18] it back and then this was the prophecy
[1:44:21] that this man got about the prophet
[1:44:25] William brandham he
[1:44:26] says and here all three Nots exactly say
[1:44:30] the same thing in French and here it was
[1:44:33] here is the way it reads because thou
[1:44:36] has chosen the Narrow Path the harder
[1:44:39] way thou has walked in your own
[1:44:43] choosing thou has speak the correct and
[1:44:46] precise decision he had a choice to
[1:44:50] reject it or take it but because he take

[1:53:11] be I just want to be with
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:20] you I can truly say that that was a
[1:53:24] masterpiece I really
[1:53:26] enjoyed and and most of all I I sat over
[1:53:30] there watching
[1:53:31] Everybody you're
[1:53:33] tired but you
[1:53:36] stayed and you gave your attention to
[1:53:38] the word that speaks
[1:53:41] volumes I am the Elder of the group but
[1:53:46] I'm still
[1:53:49] young and I I just want to commend men
[1:53:53] all of you you you're so beautiful to me
[1:53:56] because as he was saying when it comes
[1:53:59] to the young people every generation has
[1:54:02] to take the Cho torch and because of the
[1:54:05] decision that I made when I was a young
[1:54:07] person just as you are believe it or not
[1:54:11] but I I I got saved around
[1:54:14] 1819 and I have stayed with God I walked
[1:54:17] With God all my life since then never
[1:54:19] had the desire to turn back and it kept
[1:54:22] growing kept moving forward did I have
[1:54:25] trials did I have tests absolutely but
[1:54:28] once I got a taste of God there was
[1:54:31] nothing in all of my trials could turn
[1:54:34] me back so I I just want to encourage
[1:54:37] you God is getting ready to move with
[1:54:38] the young people I just believe that
[1:54:40] because it was the young people that
[1:54:42] took the took the land in Joshua's day
[1:54:46] and I just believe by the grace of God
[1:54:48] that something is happening not just
[1:54:50] here at higher ground but all over the
[1:54:53] place and for all of you to come
[1:54:54] together the way you the way you you're
[1:54:56] doing it tonight don't worry about I
[1:54:58] won't be too long I know you're really
[1:55:00] tired but I just wanted to give you uh
[1:55:03] how can I say it um just honor
[1:55:06] you uh young people don't get
[1:55:09] honored you you you get a lot of
[1:55:11] criticism but I see you I see the good
[1:55:16] that's in you and what God is going to
[1:55:18] do with you and I just want to say make
[1:55:21] the right
[1:55:22] choices that I don't think it could have
[1:55:25] been a better message
[1:55:27] today because even as an old man
[1:55:30] Hezekiah made the wrong
[1:55:32] choice that's why I try to tell people
[1:55:35] if the Lord should take me don't you
[1:55:37] come talking about praying and raising
[1:55:39] me up
[1:55:41] amen I get up with an
[1:55:45] attitude I I'm
[1:55:47] satisfied I know I'm saved I know I'm
[1:55:49] bride and so I just want to say say to
[1:55:53] the young people I've been there I've
[1:55:54] been where where you are through the
[1:55:57] battles of your flesh you know the
[1:55:59] hurtful things that go goes on between
[1:56:02] young people teenagers and all but your
[1:56:05] being here has been noted by
[1:56:09] heaven and don't think God didn't
[1:56:11] purpose this thing to be where you would
[1:56:13] be
[1:56:15] tired that wasn't an
[1:56:18] accident but you stayed
[1:56:22] you wanted to hear the word something
[1:56:24] magnetized you to the word that our our
[1:56:28] precious brother Samuel was saying I
[1:56:30] love brother Samuel I love all the
[1:56:32] ministers and I think to myself God is
[1:56:34] doing a great
[1:56:36] work and I just want to say thank I want
[1:56:38] to thank brother Samuel uh because he
[1:56:41] pressed on and pushed on and uh listen
[1:56:44] so many great things were said I don't
[1:56:47] know whether you got it but as an older
[1:56:48] man I got it and I'm just going to say
[1:56:51] from now on I'm I'm going to focus on
[1:56:53] making the right choices because because
[1:56:57] of the choice I made when I was younger
[1:56:59] I got a wonderful wife I got eight
[1:57:01] children I got 17 Grands and I'm in the
[1:57:04] message am y'all understand me five
[1:57:08] years from now five years from now your
[1:57:11] choices that you make today will
[1:57:14] determine where you are five years from
[1:57:17] now you love the Lord amen come
