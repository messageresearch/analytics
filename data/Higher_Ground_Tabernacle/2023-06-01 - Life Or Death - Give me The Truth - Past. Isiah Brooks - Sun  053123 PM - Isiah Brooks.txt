just want to kind of do a another part of it we will actually talked about coming the word of the word becoming us dealing with what we have to do with this world that we're living in and one of the things was that we were to go beyond our boundaries you know all of us have boundaries um places where we feel comfortable uh not Crossing and so but but God requires us to go beyond that amen uh there's no places uh for our personal confidence uh when it comes to the Lord Jesus and um we'll try to give you an understanding of what that is but anyway uh the subject tonight would be life or death uh give me the truth so let us turn by God's grace to Romans 8. 14 8 14. familiar scripture Romans 8 14. for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God John eight 44 through 46 ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and a bold not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh the LIE he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth ye Believe Me Not which of you convinced me of sin if I say the truth why do you not believe me you love the Lord let us pray father God we come before you Lord Jesus as humble as we know how we thank you for all that you do for us Lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and father we ask that you forgive us of our sins and cleanse us Lord God from all unrighteousness Lord we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your grace we just thank you for being Who You Are Lord and we thank you God for the many things that you have given to us in spite of but father we realize this is a serious hour and Lord we want to be more serious we want to be more consecrated we want to be more sincere and I pray father that you would give us this Lord granted because without you lord we will not make it in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated first of all I want to make a statement you know there's nothing that we can do when it comes to our Salvation other than truly believing and the believing word that I'm working with is not a noun it's an action verb as an action it's a verb and so it's what we do we first believe and we continue to believe uh what Jesus Christ has already done for us this in itself will bring us into his very image and likeness of God because the word of God tells us that we need to follow him um when I talk about truth we realize that most people do not like truth because truth in itself uh hurts oftentimes because of who we are and basically uh what we have done or the things that we have done in life um but but nevertheless the Bible said the truth shall make you free um and no matter how much it hurts I want truth you know uh the truth is always followed by the minority never the majority that's right uh if you go through the scriptures you'll find out the majority of the people is always wrong it took that small minority of people that had the ability to hear from God and believe it um when it comes to uh who we are we must we make choices and oftentimes I put this way the choices in which we make uh is because of who we are now why would you say that I'll say it like this uh to to bring you where I'm going he was the Pharisees in the Sadducees the religious people of their day they had studied the word of God and they claim to be uh the uh children of God but when Jesus Christ came and he was able to identify them so was John the Baptist John the Baptist identified those who would not follow him as serpents and Jesus Christ came and he backed them up likewise uh and so much so Jesus even said my sheep heareth my voice in a stranger they will not follow many times they want truth I mean I think it was pilate that said uh to Jesus Christ what is truth uh you know because Jesus said I come to testify of that which is truth but you see the thing is if um oftentimes people say they want truth but when truth come they don't want it right because truth always changes you yes if truth doesn't change you it's not truth basically because we were born Sinners we were born shaped in iniquity speaking lies and you know all of those things but one thing about God he gives you a choice uh in your leadership he never makes a person follow him but he will give you the choice you can either follow him or follow the devil because you're going to follow somebody and if you follow Jesus he promised to give you eternal life and of course the children of the devil are the children are the devil and we know where they are Hallelujah as I said there are two types of people the children of God and the children of devil and there are no in between that's right now sometimes it takes an individual quite a long time to I come to the reality of who or she is it may even come to a place where they're on their deathbed and they recognize that Jesus Christ is their savior but it is a thing uh difficult it's it's how can I say it it's just you're playing Russian roulette when you do such a thing because Paul said make your call in an election sure there is a way to find out who you are and that is when you find the word and the word is true and you follow the truth the Bible said they that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and we find out that there are so many people who don't even believe in the movement of the Holy Spirit they don't believe that the Holy Spirit exists they think that the holy spirit is some figment of our imagination but God is real amen and to the believer he will always be real is that right remember when I read the scripture Jesus said unto him because those which I wasn't his uh you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do I mean the very fruits of your life the very fruits of your labor the whatever you do describes who you are and that's what the Bible said you'll know the tree by the fruit it bear now don't get me wrong people of God I'm not working you know sometimes when it comes to uh people's uh personalities a Christian in himself uh could have a demon on any Spirit or soul and still have the Holy Ghost uh and and those demons will direct your life uh in in a way that is not of God it it will it will enter into your flesh and your flesh in itself is is the enemy between God I mean they fight one another that your flesh don't want to do anything of God because it's hybrid it's it's part beast and part man is that right so we know amen that the word of God tells us that Romans 6 and I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can but it but not mix it up uh the thing that you draw that's driving you is what you're worshiping hello I'ma say that again the thing that you that that is driving you is the thing that you're worshiping and you know the scripture gives us the word and I'm going to give it to you in just a moment in Romans 6 16-23 it says know ye not that whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death look what sin takes you unbelief unto death or to uh obedience unto righteousness but God but God be thanked that we were the Servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form a Doctrine which was delivered you amen right we as the Bible says we were all once children of Wrath without holy ghost or being born again we were Sinners we did everything that Sinners would do uh there was no difference between us and the man who we call sinner now we were all in the same pot being then made free from sin became the Servants of righteousness and this is what I want to dwell because when you come into Christ you are be you are made free from sin I mean free from unbelief right you get the Holy Ghost you'll never doubt it ever again amen Hallelujah you know God is real is that right see he says listen I speak after the man of men because of the infirmities of your flesh for as you have yield your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity in other words once you start it doesn't stop yeah one thing continued continues continue to continue continue to continue continue and we we know one thing it becomes a burden right and and and this sin when it is accomplished it becomes what death when it when the lust is conceived like the brother said you are now pregnant with lust and once pregnated with lust it has to bring forth a child and that child is not going to be holy it's not going to be righteous whatever the lust is it will perform right even so now you are your members servants to righteousness unto holiness so if we use that same uh how could I say it if we resist the devil the Bible said he will flee from us and therefore we're yielding our members unto righteousness and that righteousness unto what holiness for when we were the Servants of sin ye were free from righteousness right when we were Servants of sin there were no such thing as righteousness in being a sinner you're a sinner you do sinful things that's what you do you enjoy it right it wasn't about righteousness what fruit have ye been in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death and until we get to a place that we come to until we come to the place that we are ashamed of our failures ashamed of sin amen ashamed because if you're never ashamed you'll never be corrected correction won't come and this is why we come to the house of God to be corrected amen amen right but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit unto holiness and the in everlasting life this brings us into holiness right the kind of Holiness that brings us into the statue of a perfect man but here it is and this is something we know but we've often fail to remember the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord wages when you work in sin your wage is death what do you like what do you like that's that's really important especially nowadays but my readers a quote from the message leadership he said what do you what do you look like that was a what do you look like are you following what are you following what have we done you must choose your leader is that right I think it was Joshua saying choose you this day whom you going to follow choose today you choose life or death if you chew your your choice will determine your Eternal destination what you choose remember Jesus said follow me and you're invited tonight to do so and to follow him into eternal life you must come on his terms um that's right the word not upon the Creed not upon the public opinion not about what what anybody else thinks about it but on what God said about it you say well brother Benham I know a woman just as good as she can be she does this I know a man that went through this I can't help what they've done God's word he said let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth amen amen you've got to come on his term come on his condition the word you cannot come through Creed you cannot come through denominations you cannot mix like that there's only one thing you can do accept it on his terms that you're willing to die to yourself and all your thoughts and follow him get rid of all the things of the world and follow me yeah we all need help don't we second chronicles 15 I talked about that and uh where they made a covenant and the Covenant was that they were going to pursue the Lord with all their hearts and I believe that I believe if we whether from the pulpit to the back of the door if we don't pursue the law with all of our heart we're going to be left behind and I got some stuff here tonight I hope I can get through it it's not something that we don't know it's something that we need to be reminded of I showed you there in Chronicles that Esau ASA which is Asa he was a doctor God used him I mean his name and Benjamin the son of my right hand and and Judah praise and Obed worshiper and and Azariah helped by God but they failed in a condition called maca and that means pressed down worn and fast and you know when something fast you down you can't get free of it oh how many of you've been there you've had a bad dream and you can't wake up yet you are awake and and you you want to get loose and it won't let you loose it pins you down that's marker that's kind of thing that kind of a demon will do to you it puts you in a terrible situation of sin and you can't get free it's locked you in it presses you it depresses you oppressing you whatever it puts you in a bad situation until you fight and you fight and you're fighting you fight you just all worn out that's a devil amen I need to get out of this situation and the word of God said it's possible yes but you got to seek the Lord God with all your heart that's when the blessings come when you seek the Lord with all your heart here's second chronicles 15 12-16 says and they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their father with all their heart and with all their soul that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman what was it and then we had a prophet coming in our day it says desperation you have to be desperate if you don't get desperate you're going to miss it what is he saying you got to seek the Lord God with all of your heart life or death give me the truth I'm giving you the truth because most of the world don't even care about God most of the Christians are they're nothing they they're nothing about Jesus Christ is about Fame and riches and all of the wealth and things of that nature that's nonsense at a time like this foreign when judgment has already struck uh has struck the West Coast we've already already been prophesied California going down it's later than what we think and what's happening to the Christian it's getting so bad you can't even hardly find a lukewarm Christian everybody's growing cold think about it Sunday when I ministered I thought the altar of somebody would just I thought we were going to have some real weeping of some sort what do we get see something is happening to the people they don't see their condition they really think they're okay when they're not that's the same thing Israel thought when Titus came and you know Titus was judgment on Israel for rejecting Jesus and who did he destroy all of the so-called church people who fail to see Christ who fail to follow him Hallelujah guess what did they do what did they do it got so bad they were eating each other's children I got it in the scripture Jeremiah said they were getting eating each other children the father was eating his sons and all I got it and what you say oh brother oh brother gonna happen here you see it coming the handwriting is on the wall there's nothing new Under the Sun what has been will be he said oh not here look what they're doing they're trying to shut your food down anyhow what you're gonna do if you don't have God the Bible has already told you you should know these things you say oh no brother because it happened even in a time of Solomon two women came up before Solomon and they both had babies right a hard time it was a hard time and they kill one baby and they ate him and then the other lady stole you know how it goes but the truth of the matter is is horrific it's a horrible scene that those who know God would submit to such a thing because my question is after you eat somebody you still got to die that fool's gonna Digest and you're gonna get hungry again so who do you kill next and you know how calm it is what goes around come around you reap what you sow so you end up in somebody else's pot I know it sound crazy but it's the truth I'm telling you what we're getting ready to experience America has no idea what it is like or what it will be like people say oh we got poor people no go to India that's where the poor people are go some places in Mexico that's where you poor people are where they they don't even have clothes to wear right let me move on and they swear unto Allah the Lord you sound like brothers why use a you know Doom and Gloom I'm trying to warn us it's not a doom and gloom it's it's a warning amen I'm warning myself you think I'm preaching just to preach to you no no no this word comes back to me and while I Was preparing this message I was constantly repenting and they swear unto the Lord with the loud voice with the shouting with the trumpets and with coronets you see how they praising God and all Jews Rejoice at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with all the whole desire and he found he he was found of them and the lord gave them rest around about them you hear what I'm saying with their whole desire and the Bible said they were he was found of them that's what the Bible said seek ye the Lord while he may be found amen seek him early cause when these things start rolling people going to seek God and they won't be able to find it right also concerning Marcus listen and Judah rejoiced at the oath 15th verse but they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about that's what we really need it's so concerning Maca the mother ASA the king he removed her from being Queen She ruled because she had made an idol in a Grove and Asia cut down the idol her Idol and stamped it and burned it and broke at the brook of kedron what was it what was going on everything that hindered the move of God he destroyed it amen Hallelujah hey man he wasn't like a A can that went out and got it and hid it but we find out that he knew what his mother was doing he went after her mama yeah he went out the mama and he destroyed laughs removed her from the from being the queen you don't have no more rulership here there's joy in the camp now depressed oppressed or anything there's joy in the camp why because the queen has been removed huh when desperation sets in there's nothing that's going to stop you from getting what you want is that right hey you know that's the truth you see this ambulance or these cars and they got a sick person in the car and the red light could be red they care nothing about it they go straight through it nothing's going to stop them from getting to getting to the place they know they can get help Hallelujah and I say this by the grace of God you pray for me and I pray for you because nothing is going to stop me from getting what I need to have Hallelujah coming from the message question and answers by the way I said the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you than ever anything everything everything else there is in the world your prestige your life your job your anything that there is you should not cease until you have it you must receive it it must be the most and and you say well I'm afraid they they have my work I'm afraid that my husband Don't Be Afraid let that be first place let everything else go let that be first well I expect to get it or or one of these days brother I'm not one of these days now this is the time let it be the first before before I do anything else let me have it now desperate that would help answer our question when you get desperate for it really Gotta Have It Or Die see then it would then is when you're going to get it got to have it or die Hallelujah glory to God old church desperation rise and Shake Yourself pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish there is coming forth something from the Lord I know it as thus said the Lord there is coming forth something and we better get desperate amen let's be to it is between life and death it'll pass through us and we won't see it see that's that's what people don't understand because most people have become so complacent and so when you preach messages like this they say oh that's not for the message that's for the the the uh Pentecostals or whatever that that's not my idea yes it is I'm repeating to you what your Prophet said Hallelujah in 1963 after the seers were open huh see what it is you gotta it's like these people have gotten a secondhand religion yes it's been handed down since he's left and that's all they got but listen it doesn't God don't receive second-hand religion you got to have your experience yourself you must have the experience yourself Hallelujah and what we had in Pentecost ain't gonna work hello amen you know how I was when we was in the Pentecostal church or we thought we had it all but what have we done since we left it amen come on you go back to those same churches and they've gotten so worldly it's sickening but you shall receive power after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you right see we didn't understand we didn't understand the three dimensions we didn't understand the three parts of us we didn't understand that the Holy Ghost can fall on your flesh and you can shout and dance and cry and whatever more we didn't know that the Holy Ghost confide following your spirit and you can speak in tongues and all that kind of stuff but that's not where it's supposed to land it's supposed to be in the soul Hallelujah in the whole is of holy that's where he controls you from Hallelujah glory to God Proverbs 1 24-29 see what we we looking at this thing and and and and you know the church will fill up almost and you know what what happens we you know let me tell y'all something there ain't no devil somebody said something to me the other day about that and I can't remember who it was but it was a male figure and uh you know and I I just basically said you know what the only person that's going to tell me I'm not going to make it it's Jesus Christ himself I don't care if it's a Prophet come up to me speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing and if he said thus said the Lord you ain't going to make it you know I tell him already done made it the word of God is already spoken on my behalf Hallelujah I just said to him you better be patient with me because God ain't through with me yet you hear what I'm saying amen amen oh so this is what he said Proverbs 1 24 29 listen hey like the prophet of God said it was it was Jacob who was the shyster and Esau was the good man that was from the outside but on the inside Jacob was the seed he just needed an experience with God so right now you might look like a Esau but God is trying to get to Jake up he's trying to get to the com the seed that can be converted Hallelujah you know they were twins right yeah yeah one represents the Flesh and the other one represents the soul ah Hallelujah because I have called and you refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have said and not all my counsel and with none of my reproof see that's what happens you preach and you preach and you preach people run right out of the congregation right into the best of you oh they like they hadn't heard nothing it went right then the Devil comes and steal everything they thought they had right out of their spirit and soul Hallelujah that's what happens the Bible said that children of God Israel heard the word but they rose up to play and that's what you see but you have said it not all my counsel and with none of my reprove I also here you go we'll laugh at your calamity I will mock when your fear cometh he said oh where will you be he gonna be in your he's going to be in your head right your conscience remember everything what do you think who do you think preached to you if if you go to hell it's your own conscience your own soul will condemn you because your old soul wants to live but your soul will tell you what he tried to get you to do and you would do it you would not when you feel coming there's desolation in your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish come cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they will seek me early but they shall not find me for that they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the lord and that's you say oh brother someone the [Music] revelation God is talking to two C's amen amen hallelujah but he know the true seed of God will take heed to the word they love truth amen the word of the Lord that was spoken on Jeremiah what was it the Judgment of Israel you know Jeremiah God told Jeremiah said you're going to preach but ain't nobody going to repent sometimes I feel like Jeremiah oh yes ain't nobody gonna repent marker a spirit got you fastened down Lord free me because the Bible said he whom the son set free is free indeed but thus saith the Lord Jeremiah 16 9-12 for thus said the Lord of hosts the god of Israel behold I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your day the voice of myrrh and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride now hey something you know what I'm saying what is he saying God is taking his people the bride has rapture that's the only time when the bridegroom and the bride is gone and it should come to pass when thou shall show this people all these words they shall say unto thee wherefore have the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord Our God then shall thou say unto them because your fathers have forsaken me see that's the thing and you can't blame people that have grown up in the message when their their fathers and their mothers for circum they could only give you what they have right this becomes a generational kind of curse thing because they can only give listen you can't give the holy if you don't preach the Holy Ghost if you don't bring that into the uh uh uh how can I say it into the picture and all you got is religion that ain't gonna work they're going to take your religion and that's all they're going to have is religion amen is that right oh that's what the Pharisees had when Jesus come he says listen you've done all these things you did everything right but you you you you missed them the more wavier things that compassion that love that Grace you missed it amen and that's what's happening right now people are missing the most weightier things and that's love hey let me say it like this by the grace of God it ain't just in the age of Grace no more we're in the Capstone where perfect love is supposed to be on display love love your labor love your enemy love love love that's what you and I suppose we do and when we don't do that we're coming up short may God have mercy on us Hallelujah do unto others as you would have them to do unto you does it come easy not when your flesh is in rule but when God is in rule it comes easy naturally like a lamb being a lamb then shall thou say unto them because your fathers have forsaken me said the Lord and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshiped them and have forsaken me and have not kept my laws I can go down a list of things that people are doing and they don't even see it wrong anymore when brother Brandon preached so hard against it and you have done worse than your fathers you you have done worse worse worse and worse for behold you walk every one after the imagination of his heart is evil heart that they may not hearken unto me but let me tell you something you haven't had a battle until God fights against you when the Lord fights against you you are in trouble because guess what nobody can help you when the Lord fights against you he brings you up brings you under a Siege yes you Encompass With the Enemy and you can't get out and you can't fight back Jeremiah 19 9 says I would cause them to eat the Flesh of their sons and the Flesh of their daughters when did that happen one time it happened in Jerusalem 70 80 A.D 70 A.D right and what happened historics say is it got so bad to the blood came up with a horse is bridled so this is not something that just gonna happen again because I'm gonna tell you something if you read Jeremiah it will appear as if Jeremiah is standing in the midst of the United States right now he's describing his day but he's also describing our day Hallelujah I would cause him to eat the Flesh of their sons and the Flesh of their daughters and they shall eat everyone the Flesh of his friend in in the in what the siege and straightness where with their enemies they that seek their lives shall straighten them and that's what happened they didn't have nowhere to run Titus Army encompassed the whole Jerusalem they couldn't get out stayed there and what did they do they started devouring one another what's going to happen to his people when we know that the Demons of Euphrates have already been loosed they have worked their way from uh uh Hollywood and has infiltrated the entire world to everything is filled there's no hiding place not even on the moon because as long as man go to the moon sin is with him he'll just start all over again is that right oh it's true look what Noah did soon as it was over there was no change in his heart or mind right he was just Justified he wasn't Sanctified Justified amen and guess what as soon as he got off the boat he got drunk and then after that incest and then the beat goes on is that right look at it now now we're now back in the days of Noah men look look at you'll find it to be true violence fill the land Hallelujah even Jesus had in that day before the coming of the Lord Nation to be against Nation Brethren begins brother you know everybody's against everybody uh I I don't mean to be screaming but a serious message I wish the church would have been full but listen let me let me move on how many of y'all know we're living in a dangerous time you got to feel it every day you feel strange stuff you feel it it's a strangeness it ain't it's not the way it used to be it's strange oh the problem says don't think about fifth colonists hurting us don't think about Russia taking us it isn't the robin that picks on the Apple that hurts it it's a worm at the core that's what killed the Apple it isn't any other nation that we're afraid of if we have stayed where our forefathers planted the foundation we have been built upon the principle of the Bible now you haven't got any government or anything else running four terms and Breaking All the Constitution making their own laws to do what they want to do 58 19 if that ain't a prophet I don't know what is and that's exactly what they're doing breaking the Constitution to fit in and to do whatever they want to do um Hallelujah glory to God you love the Lord and in and it's nothing but honeycomb by communism the government and you know you don't know who's who hello amen who are you going to vote for if you vote they both oh my goodness hey and you can't be a politician unless you know how to lie real good I'm not saying that some don't do good do well but listen people of God you know it's um how can I say it huh it's terrible it's rotten to the core and we're living in the day one of these old days they'll lock me up for saying this but my future has already been determined by God listen friends there isn't a thing this very hour in the next 25 minutes or 10 minutes for Russia to send up its satellite and sweep over here across this nation they've been doing it train is missiles and say surrender or in two minutes you'll be nothing but dust they can do it right now think of it they can do it right now October 1958. what what would happen plain load up plane load ship load at the ship load of ungodly communist soldiers would swarm our lands would grab our girls take them into the street treat them like cattle Ram a sword through them go into our homes and take our wives out bust the baby's head against the wall ravish our women you say one thing it belongs to them let me say it like this yeah it sounds crazy what I'm reading but it's true because jehu was anointed and jehus killed and they took those babies and they broke took babies and bust their head up against the wall and everything because they rejected the truth and they thought they had gotten understand is that jehu is coming and we know Jay who is here oh yes people haven't seen nothing yet right now this is calm before the storm but it's coming oh yeah you say will our Pentecost surrender Shore in Pentagon surrendered sure it would that would be the only sensible thing to do for it to do it it would happen to do it if it didn't we'll do nothing but will excuse me we'll be nothing but powder in a few minutes we haven't made maybe a few more hours of life but what a Slaughter huh what they may be loading on the plane right now the ships may be in the harbor hello have you all heard we've had ships in our Harbor Russia and China ships and you know they don't tell you they don't want to scare you but let me tell you something you don't have to be afraid because God has a hiding place in Christ if you hide in Christ you won't have to worry about the bombs is that right because our Prophet has told us before one bomb dropped the Bride of Jesus Christ will be gone [Applause] there's not one a weapon to keep it from happening according to prophecy here we are next week you don't know what condition you could be in the handwriting is on the wall we are weighed in the balanced and found wanting now if these things are true and you see they are true you hear what he's saying if these things are true and you see that they are true then how close is the coming of the Lord tonight I want to continue what where will the church be when these uh this take place now if you now you who've always been taught that the church would take the tribulation come out come find out if this is so close if this destruction is so close how much closer is the coming of the Lord for it takes place before the church before one rocket hit this country the church will be in the arms of Christ and gone amen we're at the end it can happen anytime amen oh my God amen you love the Lord I don't mean to scream but I can't help it because I realized that that so many things are going wrong and you don't have to tell me about your battle because I'm having one myself but he said take my yoke upon you learn of me for my yoke is easy and my burden is light and all we've got to do is trust God right and trust God yes Lord I guarantee you know we're saying I'm so glad I followed those blueprints when he saw the storm that he had to encounter and I'm so glad because you know the devil was probably there saying you know what you need to just do it a little bit different than this but he had to follow it accurately see it wasn't his terms it was God's terms that's the only way you'll make it his terms listen he said just like America today with some of their rotten rotten gags and so forth that they have on television and radio and in their modern you you you people that call yourself Christians listening to such stuff now you can see where we're standing you Methodist Baptist Presbyterian you good Pentecostals something's happened to you you desire your desire got wrong for what's in your heart you'll do it wouldn't be no great surprise to me to see a pig on a manure pile feeding that's his nature but it would sure surprise me I've never did see it I never will see a lamb eating with him because of nature in him is different you don't see Christians doing those things their nature the nature of the great Holy Ghost won't let them do these things hello I'm gonna read that again the nature of the great Holy Ghost will let them do these things the Bible says if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not even in you now you can judge yourself or the word judge you if you love those things the love of God is gone from you God has first place a no place they'll owe somebody God has first place or no place blessed be his name I'm so glad of that I'm so glad that he's pure and holy we can put confidence in him he he he he compromises with nothing he is God and he's God Alone amen it's not going to come down to us we've got to measure up to him he ain't going to come to our thoughts we're God to measure his to his thoughts he ain't going to listen to our Commandments we're going to listen to his Commandments but of course we can do just what we want to and I say this with respect ninety percent of the pastors they got so weak they won't preach against it it's a meal ticket to them I'd rather have starve and wear grass sacks to cover my nakedness and preach the gospel the truth then to have uh to have fried fried chicken three times a day and compromise with the devil's trash getting to be an old man and I stood for it when I was young man I want to stand more Gallant now for I see the hours at hand what do you think the prophet of Old Testament would do if they Rose today look at conditions I don't mean to be reading all of this but it just you know we have how could I say it like we have become desensitized because things don't matter anymore there's a time you know we saw disorder we saw somebody walking in a way we would immediately pray it's different now handwriting on the wall brother Brown said when you dress like a prostitute you'll act like one that's right oh you have to do you have a lot to do what kind of a spirit is in you certainly it makes you act what's in you it makes you dress and act and live whatever is in you it governs you hello now get away from that one love or hatred is your leader if you're a sinner raise up your eyes and look now if you've been in indifferent if you had little squabbles and little things what difference does it make you're going to die one of these days what day maybe today you don't know an hour from now you may be in Hell or you may be in heaven but you've got to choose now if there's anything in your life that isn't right you choose Now by faith you say well if I can just even uh get even with her if I can uh get even with him no matter what they've done choose life choose life Jesus said if from your heart you don't forgive every person their transgression neither does your heavenly father forgive you so just get that close if there's one art in your heart against any person sinner or Saint you in danger of Hell Fire by faith Moses y'all got quiet see when truth comes the only thing you can do is repent God help me Jesus help me because I'm gonna tell you something we say I forgive but let me tell you something it doesn't come easy you can say it with your mouth but your heart is where it's lodged it takes God to remove it from the heart but he'll never remove it until you see your desire your earnest desire is for it to be removed amen ah I'm almost done you're okay with that see we have had examples to go through we we shouldn't have to be con uh act like we don't know what's going to happen to us if we don't obey God we've had examples throughout the Bible see you've had examples back there to what God did to your fathers when he got here the high-minded and let his kingdom go like that you got an example of what he did and so have you got an example of what God did to those who did walk up right didn't walk up right before him these are not mystery thing mysterious things this is not a hard message it's the truth you've got an example you know what he did back Yonder to the women who danced before the idols you know what he did to the men who went at the strange women you know what he'd done to the drunken socks and the homosexuals and the perverse of Sodom it's no strange thing you know these things said you should have known it there you there's your example by your grandfather but now this is the meaning of the writing God has numbered your kingdom you are weighed in the balance and found wanting oh if there's ever was a time that Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Pentecostals they are weighed in the balance God's balance found wanting they call the spirit of the Living God and the Unholy thing they have done despite to the work of Grace they have followed big churches and organizations you Assemblies of God you Church of God all you you Oneness and trinitarians baptism Presbyterian Catholics you know you've gone back to Babylon you had an example of that and this Branham Tabernacle knows that you've been warned of these things years ago but now you're weighed in the balance and found wanting fuss and fighting and holding grudges and stewing you think God could work in a place like that never there you are indifference Unholy without natural affection truce Baker false accusers that's the day that we're living in huh what he didn't even leave Branham Tabernacle out and That Was Then do you can you imagine what it is like now because whenever the man of God leaves it gets worse it gets worse I'm not gonna read all of this but I'm I'm gonna quote it to you a little bit Rome or Jeremiah 18 1-12 says take me to The Potter's House there I will cause thee to hear my words and then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and that's what God is doing right now at The Potter's House he's he's got got us on the Wheel you know when you when he puts you on the wheel he's already softened you up and you know he's got you going around it might you might like I'm so tired of going around in these circles but God is putting the pressure that's just the beginning of the real battle you know it seemed like I can't take it no more but you wait till he take you off of The Potter's will and then you got to go through the fire [Laughter] to realize that the pressure the head the fivefold ministry wasn't so hard on you after a while but when you go through the purifying fire where God got to take you through that fire to make sure that everything is pure if it's not pure the fire we're gonna it's going to break you it will destroy you you know and so he said the vessel that made he made of clay was marred in the hands of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seen good to the Potter to make it and that's the thing there's nothing wrong with saying Lord Make Me Over again if you come to a place and you marred you find yourself not the kind of Christian that you want to be whatever I got to go through what's ever necessary for me to please the Potter so let it be old house of Israel cannot I do with you as a Potter said the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in mine or House of Israel at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and destroy it what are you talking about he's saying I'm God I'm your maker I can do what you what I want to do and who's going to stop me but he's showing Israel listen I'm giving you a second chance you were marred so let's make this part all over again and at what instance will I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to replant it you see that to read to build and to plant excuse me or if if it to do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them and see that's what people oh but we under grace we under grace well I know one thing God has never changed his mind about his word and whether you realize or not from the Old Testament to the new the only way the people made it was by grace true they may have been under law but it was Grace that carried them over I'm almost done my thoughts is not to criticize people but I'm going to tell you something you can't trust in your flesh your flesh will betray you every time you think you're a strong man you let a lion get out there if you don't run you're gonna faint your flesh you might in your mind want to run with your flesh can't move it's terrified hmm it's true you know we love each other right but we love each other to a degree because we know that we're still flesh if you say oh I know that brother oh that brother will never do you don't know that we just hope that that brother won't or that sister won't with flash but we must have an understanding of Truth amen amen if your brother do wrong or your sister do wrong no it's the devil and not your brother or your sister it is what it is we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in high places that's our enemy not the man not the woman it's Satan amen blessed is the man the seventh verse let me read the fifth verse thus said the Lord curse should be the man that trusted trust is in man and make flesh is on and whose heart departed uh from the Lord for he shall be like the heath of in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inherit the parts places in the wilderness in a salt land and not not inhabitable blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters and that spreaded out her Roots by the river and shall not see when he's coming but her least shall be green and shall not be careful in the years of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it I the Lord searched a heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings it is God who knows you better than you know yourself Try Me O Lord that's right if you find any wicked thing in me deliver me that that should be our prayer the Bible said when you think you stand take Eve take e one thing for certain there's only one place of refuge and that's in the Lord and I'm going to close with that statement I just want one scripture then Jeremiah 17 13 14 says O Lord the hope of Israel all the all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the Earth because they have forsaken the Lord the Fountain of Living Waters Heal Me O Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for thou art my praise so at the end of the day you got to choose life or death and life comes in truth and death comes in lies and you got to choose truth you got to follow the lord Jesus Christ he says I am the way the truth and the life that's who he is and I don't care what the world is saying oh you could be saved any kind of way you can be a save and Muslim you can be a saved all that kind of crazy stuff Jesus said I'm the only way and that is what I believe and know to be truth you love the Lord people of God all I'm trying to say is that we all stand in a place where we need God to give us desperation we are living in the worst age ever and how can you be desperate when everything is at your fingertip we got an easy life but that's the thing that's killing us that's the thing that makes us lazy that's the thing that that hinders the desperation we need Jesus how many of y'all want to make a rapture oh I know in my heart I I don't live for nothing else that's all I want that's not because I'm afraid to go to hell it ain't going to do no good to be afraid to go to hell if you go in there you understand what I'm saying at least the world of people out there accept themselves and they accept that they're going to go to hell and they think that when they get there they're going to party they'll be jumping around but they won't be because of music the prophet of God said is the worst thing he's at your worst nightmare cannot even compare what hell is like he said just like you can't Envision what heaven is like even at the most Sublime thing in your mind he says far beyond that and hell is just the opposite and people are being tormented they think when I'm dead die I'm dead I'm done that's such a lie hey it's not true you have Consciousness and everything else when you go there that that Rich Young Ruler said Lord have Lazarus go and stick his hand a finger in in some water and just just place it on my tongue that wasn't no story that was truth that was history yeah he's still there still thirsting and remember oh he knew he was called to preach because he goes on to say tell go let me let me raise on the dead and go tell my brother and Jesus says no even if you raise from the dead they won't remember they won't believe you see what was he saying I will raise from the dead I'm coming from there they still won't believe why ain't nothing in there to believe may God help us Jesus help me y'all pray for me and I pray for you let's stand Lord we come before you as humble as we know how God I thank you for your word Lord you said in your scripture there's none righteous no not one [Music] and we realize that our righteousness could never be of us you have judged our righteousness as being filthy rags but your scripture have said you became sin that we might become the righteousness of God Lord direct us lead us you're the only overcomer and in order for us to be over cover you must live in US that's the only way Lord so Lord we surrender our hearts tonight [Music] we repent of all our sins our thoughts our desires our actions everything that's not like you Lord cleanse us from it Jesus father make us more sincere give us that Spirit of desperation Lord that will complete this journey Lord can't do it without it but you're the master builder you you're the Potter where the clay mold us and make us into your very image and likeness no matter what the conditions are no matter what it takes to get us there please sir here I cry hear our prayer Lord look beyond our thoughts see our needs Lord Heal our soul because Lord if you heal us we'll be healed and if you save us we'll be saved help us now help us now we're living in a dark dark age Lord where men is calling right wrong and wrong right and Lord it just seemed like I might be the only one preaching like this Lord but it's happened before but I know Lord Jesus I'm a lover of Souls and I love my soul

church those who are here and those who are not here Lord help us Lord you said there'll be a few and even as the prophet God said way back then it could drop a bomb any time we see tension everywhere we see the nations against each other political Realms of fighting one another churches are fighting Lord preachers and all are backsliding churches are moving into the state of apostasy not knowing right from wrong Lord but father you said you'll never leave yourself without a witness I pray father God you have chosen us to be a witness help us separate ourselves from everything that's not like Jesus oh God have preeminist in all of our lives father we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen [Music] father we come together with my
