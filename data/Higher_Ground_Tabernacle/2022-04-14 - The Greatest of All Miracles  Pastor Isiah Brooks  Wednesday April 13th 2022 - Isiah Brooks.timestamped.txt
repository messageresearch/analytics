[44:01] [Music]
[44:09] [Music]
[44:13] love
[44:17] you
[44:21] [Music]
[44:25] as we stand
[44:27] [Music]
[44:34] thank you lord for your grace
[44:56] as
[44:58] we turn our bibles
[45:04] saint john 14.
[45:07] i love john
[45:11] if you
[45:13] see where john is here where john is in
[45:16] his writings
[45:19] you understand
[45:22] revelations
[45:24] in a better way
[45:29] john didn't see him
[45:33] like luke
[45:34] did luke saw him as a physician
[45:37] mark saw him as an ox
[45:40] matthew as a king
[45:43] but john saw him as god
[45:46] and we realize amen that with that
[45:48] influence
[45:50] he would be the proper candidate to
[45:53] for god to inspire
[45:56] to write
[45:58] the book of revelations
[46:05] because in the book of revelation you
[46:06] got to understand that everything that
[46:08] was written there was written about god
[46:11] god's kingdom god's people
[46:15] the extra things that were placed in
[46:17] there
[46:18] dealt with the serpent and what god
[46:20] would do with them
[46:26] but the book of revelations basically
[46:28] was written to give the
[46:31] church of this last day an assurance
[46:34] not only did god in the book of
[46:36] revelation show us our beginning but he
[46:38] also
[46:39] showed us our
[46:40] ending
[46:42] no other age was able to see that
[46:46] the age of wesley no the age of luther
[46:49] no the age of pentecost though
[46:52] but this age which is called the bride
[46:54] age we see
[46:56] we can understand by god's grace what
[46:58] god is doing
[47:01] saint john 14 and 20.
[47:06] let's read the 19th verse
[47:10] yet
[47:11] a little while and the world seeth me no
[47:15] more
[47:16] but ye shall see me
[47:19] because i live
[47:21] ye shall live also
[47:25] at that day you shall know
[47:28] that i am in my father
[47:31] and ye in me
[47:33] and i
[47:34] in you
[47:36] let us pray our gracious god we thank
[47:39] you for
[47:42] your presence
[47:44] we thank you for that song and songs
[47:46] that have been song tonight
[47:49] lord i
[47:50] i i get beside myself when i
[47:53] feel you lord because i know
[47:56] uh you do these things and you show up
[47:59] by your own choosing
[48:01] none of us are worthy
[48:03] to even feel your presence but we do
[48:06] thank you father for your blessings
[48:08] tonight and
[48:09] we pray father that you would give us
[48:11] the grace to move completely out of your
[48:13] way
[48:14] that your word will be spoken uh through
[48:17] our lips lord and that the people of god
[48:19] tonight will be able to grasp and to
[48:21] hear and perceive and to take in
[48:24] the word of god so that a hundredfold
[48:27] will be brought forth in these last days
[48:30] may you give us eyes to see and are hard
[48:32] to receive in your lovely name jesus
[48:35] christ we pray
[48:36] amen
[48:38] you may be seated
[48:42] my theme basically is his kingdom is
[48:45] come
[48:48] but i like to work with the subject the
[48:50] greatest of all miracles
[48:54] we have seen throughout the church ages
[48:56] all the things that god have done has
[48:58] done
[48:59] i think that
[49:01] when i look even in the old testament
[49:03] and i see
[49:04] the great miraculous things that god did
[49:07] there
[49:08] by way of of joshua by way of moses and
[49:14] some of the great patriots like you know
[49:16] daniel and david
[49:19] it really used to make me so jealous
[49:23] because especially when i read in the
[49:25] word he's the same yesterday today and
[49:26] forever
[49:28] sometimes we look at those things as
[49:30] being so great
[49:32] and they were
[49:33] and they are
[49:36] but the greatest thing god
[49:38] has ever done he's saved to the last
[49:43] and you and i must recognize what it is
[49:48] it's a great miracle
[49:51] a great thing that god is doing
[49:54] and as a prophet of god say we can see
[49:56] what god did yesterday
[49:58] and we can always look in the future and
[50:00] see what he's doing there but
[50:02] it's very difficult for us to see what
[50:04] he's doing now
[50:07] but when your eyes are opened
[50:13] and you have received the eyes of
[50:15] enlightenment
[50:17] you'll never be the same
[50:22] to know that we have a word that is
[50:24] beyond anything
[50:26] it takes away the struggles
[50:31] one occasion brother branham said that
[50:35] the bride of jesus christ wasn't saved
[50:37] on any day
[50:41] that means that if she was saved she was
[50:43] saved in a time what we call eternity
[50:49] it takes away the wrestling
[50:52] it takes away the fear
[50:54] will i make it
[50:56] if if your names were placed on the
[50:59] lamb's book of life before the
[51:00] foundation of the world there is no way
[51:04] you could be stricken off
[51:06] the prophet god explained that to us
[51:09] through the word of god that if your
[51:10] name is on the book of life then
[51:13] it's a possibility
[51:15] that your name could be taken off like
[51:17] judas
[51:20] janice and
[51:21] i don't know some of the others but when
[51:23] it comes to the bride or those who have
[51:25] been elected and chosen by god there is
[51:28] no way
[51:30] you couldn't help your birth if you
[51:32] wanted to
[51:34] you may have looked at different nations
[51:36] and you may have seen
[51:38] uh in the indian nation or the european
[51:41] nation or the what you call asian or
[51:44] japanese or whatever you might have
[51:45] wondered warlord why once and i made one
[51:48] of those
[51:50] but god had already said in his mind
[51:52] what you were going to look like
[51:55] we understand by the process
[51:58] that god used he mixed all kinds of
[52:00] things together just to get you so it's
[52:04] not like you are a chance
[52:06] you are a masterpiece
[52:09] even in your natural
[52:12] and uh
[52:13] whether you see yourself as being good i
[52:15] could just recall when god made man in
[52:17] the beginning he said
[52:19] that's very good
[52:22] but the devil is his job to make you
[52:23] think you're nothing
[52:26] he he belittle you throughout the day
[52:29] only to keep you from recognizing who
[52:31] you really are
[52:33] because of every day you recognize
[52:36] who you really are satan is in trouble
[52:41] i love that
[52:43] as i said earlier the greatest miracle
[52:48] is the kingdom of god
[52:51] jesus said amen even when he was
[52:54] talking to herod and pilate and and the
[52:57] rest he said listen if this was my
[52:59] kingdom i would fight for it
[53:01] huh
[53:02] come on somebody
[53:04] you might must understand that god will
[53:06] fight for you
[53:11] we we look
[53:13] for this great
[53:14] uh
[53:16] coming of the lord in such a way
[53:18] that we're missing
[53:20] we're really missing his
[53:22] what he's doing now
[53:25] how you going to make heaven
[53:27] if you don't prepare yourself
[53:31] the foolish virgins were the ones who
[53:33] never prepared themselves but the wise
[53:35] virgin had all an extra oil what was
[53:38] that that was enlightenment that was
[53:40] revelation
[53:41] that was the last that was the the oil
[53:43] in her lamp that gave her a vision on
[53:46] the direction in which she should go
[53:52] so many things were dropped in our laps
[53:54] by what brother branham said he said he
[53:56] not walked with god and he was
[53:58] translated i like that
[54:01] because sometimes we don't even
[54:02] understand what translation is that
[54:04] means enoch was taken from this place to
[54:07] another
[54:09] sometimes we get confused with
[54:11] translation and transfiguration
[54:14] translation is what philip did
[54:17] he was changed from one place and he
[54:19] took found himself in another and you
[54:21] know what there was no physical change
[54:24] but the character the power of god that
[54:26] was in him was enabled him to change
[54:30] from one place to another
[54:37] this is what god is trying to do within
[54:39] us
[54:40] he's trying to build a character in us
[54:42] that when he wants us to be somewhere
[54:45] it becomes a thought and we change from
[54:47] that place to another
[54:50] there's a lot of mysteries about william
[54:51] branham that we don't know
[54:54] things that he kept to himself but
[54:56] if you
[54:57] literally search out some of the things
[54:59] that he said you'll find out
[55:02] something was different
[55:05] how can be he be here and there at the
[55:07] same time
[55:09] many times i thought he was just there
[55:11] you know by vision sometimes he was and
[55:14] sometimes he was
[55:18] by way of another way
[55:21] but here we are come to a place and
[55:23] don't tell me it's impossible
[55:27] if god translated phillip
[55:30] he could also translate william branham
[55:34] and not only that
[55:35] philip was not a prophet
[55:38] he can also translate you
[55:42] but you got to be packing the goods
[55:46] and this is what this message came to do
[55:48] enlighten us come to a place where we
[55:51] must understand his kingdom is come
[55:56] if you have the holy spirit on the
[55:58] inside of you
[56:01] it's not a second person it's not the
[56:03] third person it is the person
[56:09] he said at that day what day this day
[56:14] the miracle
[56:15] of god indwelling
[56:18] human fallen flesh
[56:22] because he's holy
[56:26] hello
[56:27] even in the old days amen the old
[56:30] testament you know not even an ox
[56:34] or goat or any animal could come close
[56:36] to the mountain
[56:38] where his holiness was
[56:41] god's holiness is beyond anything we can
[56:43] imagine we can't even fathom it
[56:47] but by god's grace he gave us a little
[56:50] piece of it
[56:52] a down payment amen of what it's like
[56:57] understand the holiness of god is
[56:59] connected to god he is holy
[57:03] you can't even be holy without him
[57:08] think about god how he he he used
[57:13] even moses when it came to the plagues
[57:15] you know they say to my he's working by
[57:18] the finger of god
[57:22] now if god can destroy
[57:25] a whole country
[57:27] a nation of people
[57:29] by the finger
[57:31] by his finger
[57:33] what else can he do
[57:35] and god has placed
[57:37] something within the bride that's not
[57:40] just a finger
[57:42] it's the very voice of god
[57:45] now i don't know about you but i believe
[57:47] this message
[57:48] the bride
[57:50] is the voice of god
[57:52] in this age
[57:58] coming from a quote israel in the church
[58:03] number four he
[58:05] he said and they
[58:07] this is the thing of god hallelujah
[58:11] i think of that finger of god
[58:15] god could open a blind eye by his finger
[58:18] this is the thing of god
[58:22] could do all these things
[58:25] look what he did with his finger
[58:27] he healed the sick
[58:29] he raised the dead
[58:31] all these things done with his finger
[58:36] what do you mean
[58:37] i said like this jesus when that woman
[58:40] was caught in adultery jesus went down
[58:43] and he used
[58:45] the finger of god
[58:49] hallelujah
[58:51] moses saw god's finger
[58:54] when the ten commandment was being
[58:56] written
[58:58] understand god is a spirit
[59:02] and that spirit is the holy ghost
[59:06] so when you say god uses his finger he's
[59:09] saying god uses his spirit
[59:12] to cast out devils
[59:13] why the bible said it is the anointing
[59:16] that destroys the yokes
[59:20] this is why it's so important
[59:23] you know we we must understand amen not
[59:26] just having the spirit of god because
[59:28] remember laodicea had the spirit of god
[59:31] in the measure
[59:33] they were able to cast out devils
[59:35] they did miracles they did signs they
[59:38] did wonders
[59:39] yet not being converted
[59:41] the disciples did wonders
[59:44] not being converted had not even gone to
[59:46] pentecost yet but it still was the holy
[59:49] spirit
[59:51] because only god can heal
[59:54] and only god can deliver
[59:57] but i want you to think about it think
[1:00:00] about the god that created all things
[1:00:04] living in you
[1:00:07] and yet
[1:00:09] we live like underprivileged children
[1:00:15] upc
[1:00:20] and we fail to see amen what god is
[1:00:23] doing with us disrespectful we are
[1:00:27] sometimes we come to church as though
[1:00:29] we're sitting in a lecture we there is
[1:00:31] no joy no peace no nothing and we're
[1:00:34] listening and but are we perceiving are
[1:00:37] we receiving what he says
[1:00:41] i believe in change and i believe that
[1:00:43] when we come to church and leave we
[1:00:45] should never go back out
[1:00:48] the way we came in
[1:00:54] think about it god does more with you
[1:00:59] not only can god deliver you
[1:01:01] but brother baron said when he went
[1:01:03] after a lost sheep
[1:01:05] he never used his finger
[1:01:09] he put him on his shoulder
[1:01:12] and brought him in
[1:01:14] hallelujah he said what a security
[1:01:17] a lost sheep
[1:01:19] on his shoulder
[1:01:22] not his finger he didn't even use
[1:01:25] he used his shoulder to pack the sheep
[1:01:29] in
[1:01:31] so you said well i make it
[1:01:33] if you on his shoulder
[1:01:36] he'll bring you in on his shoulder
[1:01:39] and the strongest part of a man is his
[1:01:42] shoulder
[1:01:46] they asked jesus said lord
[1:01:49] teach us how to pray
[1:01:52] prayer is so scrupled up
[1:01:56] people don't know how to pray
[1:02:00] they want to pray selfishly
[1:02:06] sometimes when people pray they
[1:02:08] they want to pray revenge
[1:02:12] but let me tell you something the bride
[1:02:14] never prays
[1:02:15] for revenge
[1:02:19] hello under the law
[1:02:22] they pray for
[1:02:24] revenge
[1:02:25] even in the old testament i mean excuse
[1:02:27] me the new testament right
[1:02:30] those souls under the altar cries out
[1:02:32] how long how long
[1:02:35] when abel was struck dead
[1:02:38] the blood of abel cried out
[1:02:42] see god amen bride does not call for
[1:02:46] revenge she's like stephen father
[1:02:48] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:02:50] do and when you pray for revenge it
[1:02:52] never will happen
[1:02:55] it's not the perfect will of god for you
[1:02:56] to do that
[1:02:58] you're not even under the right
[1:02:59] inspiration you're like elijah lord send
[1:03:01] down the fire
[1:03:05] when you pray
[1:03:07] prayer is a worship
[1:03:10] it's thanksgiving it's
[1:03:12] adoring god
[1:03:14] it's not just lord with a list god give
[1:03:16] me this give me that and if you give me
[1:03:18] this i'll do that that's not prayer
[1:03:21] that's bargaining
[1:03:24] you don't have to bargain with god
[1:03:27] hello
[1:03:28] he didn't say whatsoever you bargained
[1:03:31] with me
[1:03:33] he said whatsoever you ask in my name
[1:03:38] believing it it shall be given
[1:03:40] oh don't no i'm not knocking on nobody
[1:03:43] i've done it
[1:03:44] i'm guilty
[1:03:47] i don't do that anymore but i've been
[1:03:49] guilty of doing the very same thing
[1:03:53] how are you going to keep a covenant
[1:03:54] with god
[1:03:56] when no man of all all men of all ages
[1:03:58] have always failed him
[1:04:02] you love the lord
[1:04:04] coming into this thing he says lead us
[1:04:07] not
[1:04:08] into temptation but deliver us from evil
[1:04:13] listen
[1:04:14] for thine is the kingdom
[1:04:17] in other words god
[1:04:20] you're the power
[1:04:21] you're the glory
[1:04:23] it's not me
[1:04:25] dying is the kingdom and if i'm living
[1:04:28] in the kingdom i'm living in your power
[1:04:31] i'm living in your glory that's the way
[1:04:33] it must be
[1:04:36] we must use these tools
[1:04:39] that's what the word is for
[1:04:41] this is what bride comes into she begins
[1:04:44] to amen every word
[1:04:47] she punctuated with an amen this is what
[1:04:49] he said this is what he means and this
[1:04:52] is what is going to happen
[1:04:55] mark 10 23
[1:04:57] let's turn there
[1:04:59] and it reads
[1:05:01] and jesus looked around about
[1:05:04] and said unto his disciples how hardly
[1:05:07] shall they that have riches
[1:05:10] enter into the kingdom of god
[1:05:14] a brother and i was talking just the
[1:05:16] other day
[1:05:17] and every one of us in here are rich
[1:05:21] you may not think you are
[1:05:23] but you are
[1:05:26] all i got to do is compare you with
[1:05:28] india and some of these places like
[1:05:30] mexico that where people don't even have
[1:05:32] a chain water to bathe in or food or
[1:05:35] toothbrush you understand me
[1:05:38] we're rich because we have change of
[1:05:39] clothes we have food and most of all
[1:05:43] he blesses us every day
[1:05:48] we just don't understand it and
[1:05:49] sometimes we take those riches
[1:05:52] those wealthy things those things that
[1:05:55] god gives us like laodicea and we feel
[1:05:58] like we have need of nothing but let me
[1:06:00] tell you something you have need of god
[1:06:03] until your soul is filled you have need
[1:06:06] of god
[1:06:09] because what would it what good would it
[1:06:12] do the word of god says
[1:06:14] if you gain the whole world what is this
[1:06:16] what is this
[1:06:19] you know i i don't want to talk about
[1:06:21] things out in the world but let me tell
[1:06:23] you something it's it doesn't matter how
[1:06:25] great star you are
[1:06:27] you can be the greatest so-called
[1:06:29] superstar out there and all it takes is
[1:06:32] one mistake
[1:06:35] and like ravenous wolves and like
[1:06:37] vultures they could eat you alive
[1:06:39] why there's no true love out there
[1:06:43] fame and fortune means nothing ask
[1:06:46] lucifer
[1:06:48] he'll tell you his story
[1:06:51] all it does is lift you up and make you
[1:06:53] think you better than somebody else and
[1:06:55] let me tell you something you're not
[1:06:59] part can't call the kiddo greasy
[1:07:02] you understand me we're all i don't care
[1:07:05] what nationality you are
[1:07:10] the bible says we've all sinned
[1:07:13] and come short of the glory of god
[1:07:15] i love that scripture
[1:07:17] especially when people think they're
[1:07:19] better than me
[1:07:21] i'm not better than no one
[1:07:24] and what i am is what god has made me
[1:07:28] same to you
[1:07:31] watch this thing
[1:07:34] because you got to realize amen you
[1:07:35] don't you're not here to make a name for
[1:07:38] yourself
[1:07:40] you're here to make a name for jesus
[1:07:45] you don't have a kingdom none of us have
[1:07:47] kingdoms to put people in
[1:07:49] and you'll find out that everybody that
[1:07:51] sought to make themselves a name
[1:07:54] fail
[1:07:59] and the disciples was astonished at
[1:08:02] these words
[1:08:04] but jesus answered again and said unto
[1:08:06] unto them children how hard it is for
[1:08:08] them that have trust in riches to enter
[1:08:12] the kingdom of god
[1:08:14] let me say it like this
[1:08:17] people who trust in their churches
[1:08:19] people who trust in their pastors
[1:08:22] people who trust i mean your pastor
[1:08:25] can't save you
[1:08:26] your church can't save you there's only
[1:08:29] one savior
[1:08:30] and that's the lord jesus christ
[1:08:33] if you put your trust in anything other
[1:08:38] than the word of god to save you you are
[1:08:41] truly antichrist
[1:08:43] but god don't care i've been in the
[1:08:45] message well those with with moses was
[1:08:47] in the message too
[1:08:50] don't mean nothing until you change that
[1:08:53] spirit
[1:08:55] it is easier for a camel to go through
[1:08:58] the eye of a needle than for a rich man
[1:09:00] to enter into the kingdom of god
[1:09:03] y'all understand what he's saying
[1:09:05] who is the kingdom dying is the kingdom
[1:09:08] how can you enter into god until you
[1:09:09] become nothing
[1:09:12] one thing about the camel he had to
[1:09:13] humble himself
[1:09:15] to get through the eye of the needle the
[1:09:17] camera has to crawl
[1:09:20] and you know what he also has to take
[1:09:22] every one of those burdens
[1:09:25] backpacks and everything off of him
[1:09:27] before he could ever go through
[1:09:30] see that's how it is you can't enter god
[1:09:32] amen with some of your stuff
[1:09:36] everything has to be set aside
[1:09:39] you must become naked before god before
[1:09:42] he could ever clothe you
[1:09:47] they were astonished
[1:09:49] out of measure
[1:09:50] saying among themselves who then can be
[1:09:53] saved
[1:09:54] and jesus looked upon
[1:09:56] them saying with men it is impossible
[1:09:59] but with god
[1:10:01] for with god all things are possible
[1:10:04] then peter began to say unto him lord we
[1:10:06] have left all and have followed thee you
[1:10:10] see peter said well what is that i've
[1:10:12] given it up all
[1:10:13] i've given everything up everything we
[1:10:17] have he says
[1:10:21] and jesus answered and said verily
[1:10:23] verily i say unto you
[1:10:24] the you there is no man that have left
[1:10:27] houses now he began to break it down
[1:10:30] you've left everything
[1:10:33] there's no men that have left house
[1:10:35] or brethren or sister a father or wife
[1:10:40] or children or
[1:10:42] children
[1:10:44] or lands
[1:10:46] that means everything he's named must be
[1:10:48] given up
[1:10:52] hello
[1:10:53] you got to cut it loose
[1:10:55] first of all you cannot save anybody
[1:10:58] with all of your witnessing you still
[1:11:01] can't save anybody
[1:11:04] you can live the most holy life amen uh
[1:11:08] and people can realize that or or see
[1:11:10] that you're different but instead of
[1:11:12] saying you know i wouldn't mind
[1:11:14] you know having what joe got no it
[1:11:16] doesn't work like that
[1:11:19] the bible said this world can't
[1:11:21] comprehend light
[1:11:23] just like the true children of god can't
[1:11:25] comprehend darkness
[1:11:28] now let me hurry up because i'm going
[1:11:29] too slow
[1:11:32] but he shall receive a hundredfold
[1:11:35] now in this time
[1:11:37] houses and brethren and sisters and
[1:11:40] you can't get it no better than that
[1:11:44] when you think you've given everything
[1:11:46] up
[1:11:47] god said i'm gonna bless you by doing so
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:51] i'm gonna give you what a hundredfold
[1:11:53] that means no room for more
[1:11:57] i'm gonna give you a hundred for
[1:11:59] whatever that is
[1:12:01] in this time
[1:12:03] houses and brethren and sisters and
[1:12:06] mothers and children and lands with
[1:12:09] persecution
[1:12:10] there you go
[1:12:12] and in the world to come eternal life
[1:12:15] in other words what he said i'm going to
[1:12:17] give you a royal family
[1:12:20] amen i'm going gonna give you brothers
[1:12:22] and sisters who they've got all of this
[1:12:24] and when they really brothers and
[1:12:26] sisters whatever they have is yours
[1:12:30] y'all got quiet on that
[1:12:34] because listen
[1:12:37] real brothers and sisters will
[1:12:40] say come on in and make yourself at home
[1:12:44] we're brothers and sisters are real
[1:12:46] brothers and sisters
[1:12:48] you know
[1:12:49] you're not the other brothers and
[1:12:50] sisters
[1:12:53] real brothers and sisters become fathers
[1:12:55] they become mothers you know what i'm
[1:12:56] saying we we
[1:12:58] we understand all of these things
[1:13:02] and he says now you're gonna have a
[1:13:03] hundredfold
[1:13:07] but i'm gonna give you some persecution
[1:13:08] with that and that's the part we don't
[1:13:10] want
[1:13:11] but you know what persecution is a
[1:13:13] blessing
[1:13:15] [Laughter]
[1:13:17] he said if you're not persecuted if you
[1:13:19] don't go through no suffering you are
[1:13:20] not mine
[1:13:22] that's what he said
[1:13:24] blessed is the man or woman who suffer
[1:13:27] persecution for what my name say
[1:13:30] persecution is part of it
[1:13:33] and when you don't get it you need to
[1:13:34] double check
[1:13:36] now persecution don't always come from
[1:13:38] outside most of the time it comes from
[1:13:40] family
[1:13:42] even your family get jealous oh you
[1:13:43] think you're holier than now you think
[1:13:46] you're better now let's move on the
[1:13:48] kingdom of god always is hidden from the
[1:13:50] religious ones
[1:13:52] that's what gets me
[1:13:54] a lot of time people are so religious
[1:13:57] and they think being religious is being
[1:13:59] holy
[1:14:01] when it is not
[1:14:03] religion is nothing but a covering
[1:14:07] pharisees were religious
[1:14:10] but on the inside there were dead men
[1:14:12] bones
[1:14:14] many people in the messenger religious
[1:14:17] ain't got a drop of life
[1:14:22] may god help us
[1:14:24] because really as long as you marry to a
[1:14:27] system instead of jesus christ
[1:14:32] huh you're dead men's bones
[1:14:36] you say well what do you mean jesus said
[1:14:37] because i live you shall live wait when
[1:14:40] i thought i thought his disciples was
[1:14:42] already living
[1:14:43] but they were not
[1:14:45] they were living naturally but they had
[1:14:46] not yet been quickened
[1:14:49] they had not received the holy ghost and
[1:14:51] as long as you out here in heaven
[1:14:53] received the holy ghost you're dead
[1:14:54] while you're living
[1:14:57] and pleasure will be your portion
[1:15:00] pleasures of the world are not pleasures
[1:15:02] of god
[1:15:10] at his right hand
[1:15:12] there's pleasures forevermore
[1:15:15] what who is his right hand
[1:15:18] jesus christ
[1:15:19] that's where our pleasures are supposed
[1:15:21] to be amen
[1:15:23] christianity
[1:15:26] it's not an extracurricular activity
[1:15:30] it is something you just don't put on on
[1:15:32] wednesday you just you know we're gonna
[1:15:34] we're gonna put it on on a sunday no sir
[1:15:37] christianity is life
[1:15:42] you can't change from a sheep to a wolf
[1:15:44] and then from a wolf to a sheep
[1:15:48] your nature will define you
[1:15:55] you and i must understand it's a hidden
[1:15:57] thing
[1:15:58] it's the greatest thing that ever struck
[1:16:00] the earth
[1:16:01] we didn't understand it
[1:16:03] we as pentecostals we thought when you
[1:16:05] shout you got it when you dance you got
[1:16:08] it when you run you got it when you come
[1:16:10] to church you got it brother man say you
[1:16:12] can pay your tithes you can do all of
[1:16:14] that
[1:16:15] but until you baptized with the holy
[1:16:17] ghost
[1:16:18] until you've got god on in you it won't
[1:16:20] mean a thing
[1:16:24] and that is the kingdom
[1:16:27] and when the kingdom comes in you
[1:16:30] hello you become the housing of god the
[1:16:34] bible called it the temple of god
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:39] amen mark 4 11-12
[1:16:42] you know what i this has been my prayer
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:49] i
[1:16:50] i don't want just a church
[1:16:52] i don't want a pastor a church
[1:16:55] i want to be be the pastor of the bride
[1:16:58] amen
[1:16:59] i want to see
[1:17:01] lives changed
[1:17:03] it cannot be the pastor you know that's
[1:17:06] that's
[1:17:07] catholicism
[1:17:09] when you think that the only holy man is
[1:17:12] the priest
[1:17:13] and that's the way they live as
[1:17:15] catholics you know or even some of these
[1:17:18] apostolics a pentecostal church the
[1:17:20] pastor is the holy one and we're just
[1:17:23] following him and he's going to take us
[1:17:25] in yeah he'd take you in if you holy
[1:17:27] with him
[1:17:31] no excuses
[1:17:34] and my thing is either we're at a place
[1:17:37] of change
[1:17:38] or we're going to be left behind
[1:17:42] that's the truth that's what happened to
[1:17:44] pentecost
[1:17:46] when god sent malachi 4
[1:17:49] to bring them to repentance god gave
[1:17:52] them that space to repent and they would
[1:17:54] not
[1:17:55] and what did god do
[1:17:57] he left him behind
[1:17:59] brother ben said when god opened those
[1:18:01] seals god
[1:18:03] calls laodicea to fall asleep
[1:18:07] and right now they think they are awake
[1:18:10] they think that they're right in the the
[1:18:12] spirit of god because they're they
[1:18:14] they're casting out devils that miracles
[1:18:16] are still there
[1:18:17] but they're missing the greatest of all
[1:18:19] miracles
[1:18:21] laodicea he knocked at the door and says
[1:18:24] if you would open up to me i would come
[1:18:26] in and i'll sup
[1:18:28] they missed it
[1:18:30] that god was saying this is the hour
[1:18:32] this is the day that you'll come to a
[1:18:35] place to know that i am in you and you
[1:18:37] are in me
[1:18:40] and with us you and me in the father we
[1:18:43] become one
[1:18:46] this is the kingdom
[1:18:48] this is what god is talking about he's
[1:18:50] not talking about religion everybody's
[1:18:53] got it
[1:18:55] religion muslims got religion
[1:18:58] buddhas have religion
[1:19:01] but what's on the inside
[1:19:04] what are you covering
[1:19:06] and what's covering you
[1:19:09] it's yours
[1:19:15] listen mark 4 11-12 says
[1:19:18] and he said unto them unto you it is
[1:19:21] given to know the mystery of the kingdom
[1:19:23] of god
[1:19:25] but unto them that are without
[1:19:28] all these things are done in parables
[1:19:32] that seeing they may see
[1:19:37] and not perceive
[1:19:39] and hearing they may hear
[1:19:41] and not understand
[1:19:43] lest at any time they should be
[1:19:45] converted and their sins shall be
[1:19:48] forgiven
[1:19:49] them
[1:19:50] god said in laodicea they will be blind
[1:19:55] naked
[1:19:56] and don't even know it
[1:19:59] it was their choosing what nakedness
[1:20:02] you're talking about not just naturally
[1:20:05] spiritually
[1:20:07] you don't have a house without god
[1:20:11] there is no word body for you
[1:20:18] help us lord
[1:20:20] it's yours
[1:20:21] the revelation of god in this day is
[1:20:25] christ in you
[1:20:28] not by just feeling it
[1:20:32] manifesting
[1:20:35] manifesting that's what made malachite
[1:20:38] fall different from everybody else
[1:20:41] it was the manifestation of the word for
[1:20:43] that day
[1:20:44] that made him who he was
[1:20:47] you can't oh i'm right i'm right
[1:20:49] everybody's saying their bride but pride
[1:20:52] is a manifestation of christ in you
[1:20:56] and how can you manifest him if you
[1:20:57] don't know he's come for that reason
[1:21:00] that was the purpose of god
[1:21:02] that he would enhouse people
[1:21:05] like they said to jesus when he says i
[1:21:07] and the father are one
[1:21:10] and they took up stones to crucify to
[1:21:12] kill him to stone him
[1:21:14] and he said for what reason
[1:21:16] will you pick those stones up to stone
[1:21:18] me
[1:21:20] he said because you being a man
[1:21:23] make yourself god
[1:21:25] and brother branham said it like this
[1:21:26] they had it backwards
[1:21:28] it was god
[1:21:30] who was making himself a man
[1:21:32] and that's what god is doing now
[1:21:35] in individuals god manifesting himself
[1:21:38] in man a natural
[1:21:41] sinful fleshly man
[1:21:43] that's the power of the blood
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:51] hallelujah christ is the mystery of god
[1:21:53] reveal amen
[1:21:55] brother battle says i love that
[1:21:58] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:22:01] prove the word mystery christ is god
[1:22:05] revealed
[1:22:07] that's who god is
[1:22:11] you love the lord
[1:22:13] in that message
[1:22:16] paragraph 609 he says identified
[1:22:19] oh the devil is howling about this
[1:22:23] the manifested truth of the promise of
[1:22:25] the word in her alone
[1:22:29] it ain't in laodicea
[1:22:32] that's what happened
[1:22:33] you know that's what happened to
[1:22:34] laodicea that's what happened to a lot
[1:22:36] of message people they don't want to go
[1:22:38] further
[1:22:39] they want to keep all of the the thing
[1:22:42] dangles of of the pentecostal agent and
[1:22:45] all of that stuff they had wasn't right
[1:22:48] if it was all right we wouldn't have
[1:22:49] needed a profit
[1:22:51] but we can't go backwards because listen
[1:22:53] it didn't work for them what make you
[1:22:55] think is going to work for you
[1:22:58] god is a progressive god
[1:23:01] oh y'all don't got quiet on me now
[1:23:04] because that's what they every age
[1:23:06] that's what they do
[1:23:08] instead of going forward they go fall
[1:23:10] backwards
[1:23:12] but this is not a digression this is a
[1:23:15] progression
[1:23:16] we must go forward
[1:23:18] it doesn't you know the bible says you
[1:23:20] know leaving all of these other things
[1:23:22] behind and let us press toward the mouth
[1:23:24] let us press toward perfection listen
[1:23:26] that doesn't mean you know you can't
[1:23:27] rejoice that doesn't mean you can't
[1:23:29] enjoy jesus
[1:23:32] no no no you're not taking away you're
[1:23:34] adding to
[1:23:36] but don't you must add two
[1:23:38] you just can't keep what you had
[1:23:42] if you keep just what you had and that's
[1:23:44] what i find out that you know even in
[1:23:47] this message you know we we've got all
[1:23:49] of this
[1:23:50] emotional stuff going on now and
[1:23:51] nothing's wrong with it i love it y'all
[1:23:53] know i love that
[1:23:55] but i know one thing that's not it
[1:23:57] i had that in in the apostolic church
[1:24:01] you understand what i'm saying we
[1:24:03] shouted we danced we spoke in tongues we
[1:24:05] were gifted
[1:24:06] we had all hey preachers oh yes we had
[1:24:09] them
[1:24:10] but that wasn't it
[1:24:12] it was a part of it
[1:24:15] but the message came to take us to
[1:24:17] perfection
[1:24:18] bring us to a maturity
[1:24:21] where god can entrust you
[1:24:24] putting away the childish things like
[1:24:27] oh well um how can i say let me give you
[1:24:30] give you an example listen let me say it
[1:24:33] like this if i never feel god again i
[1:24:35] know i got him on the inside
[1:24:38] i don't go by my feelings
[1:24:40] it's faith that declares him
[1:24:44] but oh i don't feel god i just feel lost
[1:24:46] i don't feel lost
[1:24:49] no
[1:24:50] because i don't feel him means nothing
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:54] because he's in my soul and there's no
[1:24:56] feelings there only faith
[1:25:01] what's going to happen when you sick and
[1:25:03] you don't feel the anointing anointing
[1:25:05] you then
[1:25:06] you understand what i'm saying pain
[1:25:08] racking your body oh god doesn't love
[1:25:10] because the pain rack in my body
[1:25:12] nonsense
[1:25:15] that's childish
[1:25:17] that's what we do god you all these bad
[1:25:19] things happen to me you don't you must
[1:25:21] not love me that shows you still a child
[1:25:24] and you need to grow up
[1:25:27] isn't that true
[1:25:28] it is we come to church and we always
[1:25:31] please and god are singing what oh god
[1:25:34] you this you my dis and you mind this
[1:25:36] you've done this for me you've done that
[1:25:37] for me you've done this for me and then
[1:25:39] what we can say what songs we gonna
[1:25:41] start writing on how we doing what he
[1:25:42] you know
[1:25:44] him
[1:25:47] you understand me
[1:25:48] what what song we need songs that's
[1:25:51] gonna worship him and not us
[1:25:57] he's always been good
[1:25:59] he's always done well
[1:26:02] he don't need us to tell us him how good
[1:26:04] he is what god wants to see is himself
[1:26:07] in you
[1:26:08] that's the greatest praise you could
[1:26:10] ever give god
[1:26:12] is to let him have full control of you
[1:26:16] but that's nothing but the truth
[1:26:18] there was a boy in south carolina he
[1:26:20] looked just like michael jackson just
[1:26:22] like him hair face everything riding
[1:26:25] down you know the streets you know what
[1:26:27] i mean and you know i thought myself
[1:26:29] that is the greatest praise he could
[1:26:30] ever give michael jackson
[1:26:35] the greatest worship you got these
[1:26:37] people amen trying to impersonate you
[1:26:39] know uh elvis presley
[1:26:42] that's the greatest worship you could
[1:26:43] ever give ever presley
[1:26:47] and the greatest phrase of worship you
[1:26:50] can give god is to let god impersonate
[1:26:53] himself in you
[1:26:55] that's the truth
[1:26:57] we shouldn't fear diseases we shouldn't
[1:27:00] fear nothing because there is no fear in
[1:27:02] god
[1:27:04] the thing about it is what i realized
[1:27:06] this is that when we ask god to heal us
[1:27:09] we expect god to snap crack a pop and we
[1:27:11] want him to heal us on our own time
[1:27:13] instead of the devil say see you don't
[1:27:15] love you and god didn't heal you that's
[1:27:16] a lie that that's one of the biggest
[1:27:19] lies he ever told
[1:27:23] the point is
[1:27:24] in his time
[1:27:26] he makes all things beautiful
[1:27:29] but we want god to do it our turns it's
[1:27:32] not it ain't going to happen
[1:27:35] he let that man stay there at the gate
[1:27:38] of beautiful all those years what about
[1:27:40] the pool of salon
[1:27:43] and he must have gotten frustrated many
[1:27:45] times when he tried to run into that
[1:27:47] pool and somebody beat him
[1:27:50] huh as if god never hurt him
[1:27:53] god heard his prayer
[1:27:55] what and he came down personally
[1:28:03] that's what we don't understand god
[1:28:05] always hear us
[1:28:07] when did god become death
[1:28:12] and you don't even have to scream for
[1:28:14] them to hear you
[1:28:15] the bible said he picks up your thoughts
[1:28:20] and you and i must understand god loves
[1:28:23] us if he didn't love you listen people
[1:28:24] with all that sin stuff you and i have
[1:28:26] done we'd have been dead long time ago
[1:28:29] but god has put us in an age that called
[1:28:31] it grace
[1:28:34] and mercy
[1:28:37] i'm grateful
[1:28:39] i'm blessed to be standing right here
[1:28:42] right now
[1:28:43] and you're blessed to be setting where
[1:28:45] you are
[1:28:47] healthy and strength and all that kind
[1:28:49] of stuff in your right mind you could be
[1:28:51] somewhere dribbling your lips and
[1:28:52] slobbing
[1:28:54] but god got you in your right mind
[1:28:58] it's these things that we fail to look
[1:29:00] at and see amen what god i don't know
[1:29:02] how he put up with us
[1:29:06] you know i'm laughing but you know
[1:29:08] that's the kind of love and patience i
[1:29:10] want to have
[1:29:11] i want to be like him
[1:29:13] that i could put up with the even the
[1:29:15] unlovable
[1:29:17] or love the unlovable i want that i want
[1:29:19] all that he is in me
[1:29:22] i want to see that on display
[1:29:25] so much so i don't have to think about
[1:29:27] it
[1:29:28] i don't want to process as long as i'm
[1:29:30] processing it he's not in full control
[1:29:34] but when he's in full control i don't
[1:29:36] have to process it i just do it
[1:29:38] they said lord
[1:29:40] when did we feed the poor
[1:29:42] when did we visit you in prison
[1:29:45] they were so engaged with god
[1:29:47] they never never thought about it
[1:29:51] that's the kind of life i desire
[1:29:53] to have and i'm not going to stop until
[1:29:55] i see him completely
[1:29:57] manifested through me if i become the
[1:29:59] greatest and the only oddball in this
[1:30:01] day that's what i want people can call
[1:30:04] me crazy but i know what i'm looking at
[1:30:08] and it goes on and says and his church
[1:30:09] stands alone listen what he's saying i
[1:30:11] want you to hear what this quote is
[1:30:13] saying
[1:30:16] and this is christ the mystery of god
[1:30:18] revealed
[1:30:20] and his church stands alone
[1:30:24] she is not hooked
[1:30:26] with nothing
[1:30:28] but he was identified by god
[1:30:32] being the body that god dwelt in
[1:30:35] and the church is identified by his body
[1:30:39] doing the same thing
[1:30:41] she is his body
[1:30:43] the manifested truth of his promised
[1:30:46] word for the last days
[1:30:48] and she
[1:30:50] and she alone
[1:30:51] stands by it
[1:30:54] that's why the devil is howling
[1:30:57] these great organizations to set up
[1:31:00] something to close her up they'll never
[1:31:03] do it she'll be taken up
[1:31:05] not closed up she is now risen
[1:31:09] what she is now risen
[1:31:12] and by the power of the vindicated word
[1:31:15] promised to her what she is now do y'all
[1:31:18] understand what that means
[1:31:20] when you were quickened to this message
[1:31:22] that was your place of resurrection
[1:31:26] amen that's what started it
[1:31:29] it's not that you're going not gonna go
[1:31:31] in into the fullness of it
[1:31:33] but that's when you came amen and the
[1:31:35] holy ghost came in you and you was
[1:31:37] quickened from death unto life
[1:31:42] translated setting in heavenly places
[1:31:46] in christ jesus
[1:31:50] you're not of this world and neither are
[1:31:51] you in this world
[1:31:53] half per se
[1:31:55] because there's a part of you that's in
[1:31:56] heavenly places right now
[1:31:59] now if i'm risen that means i was dead
[1:32:04] paul wrote about it many times you he
[1:32:06] has quickened amen who were dead and in
[1:32:09] trespasses and sin you and then he goes
[1:32:12] on and says but now
[1:32:14] you are the sons of god that's john
[1:32:17] not tomorrow
[1:32:18] today
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:22] oh i wish i could preach it like i see
[1:32:24] it
[1:32:29] you know at some point in time
[1:32:35] i think god's going to get tired of our
[1:32:37] complaining
[1:32:42] yeah sarah did laugh
[1:32:46] but she didn't continue to laugh
[1:32:49] and at some point in time god gave her
[1:32:51] strength
[1:32:52] that she could see that the revelation
[1:32:55] that that the angel was giving given to
[1:32:57] her was giving to her was her she was
[1:33:00] the one
[1:33:02] you got to realize amen the message that
[1:33:04] the angel gave to us is for us
[1:33:07] we're the ones who bring the promised
[1:33:09] sun
[1:33:11] we're the one
[1:33:12] we're the impregnated ones who have god
[1:33:15] on the inside and he's maturing in us as
[1:33:18] paul said grow up into him
[1:33:21] you can't just say i'm i'm bride and
[1:33:24] you're still the same place you were
[1:33:25] what a few years ago there's got to be
[1:33:27] some changes somewhere search for it
[1:33:30] search
[1:33:30] it's got to be something
[1:33:33] something that's going to signify that
[1:33:34] you're alive
[1:33:40] how a bride holds that promise
[1:33:43] he told me he would return after me
[1:33:45] i believe it see yes sir
[1:33:48] to meet her headship
[1:33:50] her redeemer her husband her king her
[1:33:54] lord her lover her savior in the
[1:33:57] provided play meeting place let me ask
[1:34:00] you something
[1:34:02] where do you meet him when did you meet
[1:34:04] him
[1:34:06] the provided place to meet him was in
[1:34:09] this message
[1:34:10] in the message of malachi thor
[1:34:14] in the opening of the word
[1:34:16] that's where you meet him
[1:34:18] oh come on somebody you're looking at a
[1:34:20] natural body i'm working with christ

[1:34:35] how are you going to be an invisible
[1:34:37] union and you never meet him
[1:34:40] who did you unite with
[1:34:44] christ
[1:34:46] why because now you are his body
[1:34:50] you are his temple
[1:34:54] and if he's living in you
[1:34:56] why don't you let him live put him on
[1:34:58] display stop hiding your light under a
[1:35:01] bushel

[1:35:05] be ashamed to let people know
[1:35:09] who you stand for i told a guy today i
[1:35:12] said they can do a lot of things but one
[1:35:14] thing i know about about this experience
[1:35:16] i have they can't bawl him out of me
[1:35:19] they can't burn him out of me they can't

[1:35:27] i love my lord i just
[1:35:29] got to love him like he loved me
[1:35:35] how a bride holds that promise
[1:35:38] he told me he would return after me come
[1:35:40] on somebody what kind of pastor you
[1:35:42] think god's supposed to be just let us
[1:35:44] go on and not say something
[1:35:47] the word of god is here to correct us
[1:35:50] and you and i need to accept correction
[1:35:52] and move on with god
[1:35:54] ask god for a greater and deeper
[1:35:55] revelation this is what the message is
[1:35:57] all about
[1:35:59] is that right
[1:36:00] the god the bible says
[1:36:02] you know anoint your eyes with assad
[1:36:04] that you might see
[1:36:07] right
[1:36:08] understand gold tried in the fire trial
[1:36:11] is going to come
[1:36:13] hard breaks are going to come
[1:36:17] it ain't going to be your dog or your
[1:36:19] cat
[1:36:21] it's going to come through people
[1:36:27] to meet her headship her redeemer her
[1:36:30] husband her king and you know you gotta
[1:36:32] meet him before you meet him
[1:36:37] he's got a place to meet them
[1:36:39] brother said the provided place was the
[1:36:41] provided place
[1:36:44] you've read the message you've heard the
[1:36:45] message
[1:36:46] there's only one provided place of
[1:36:49] worship and that's under the blood
[1:36:51] and that's not natural that's spiritual
[1:36:54] unto christ in christ alone i give my
[1:36:58] glory in christ alone i give him my
[1:37:01] praise in christ alone
[1:37:09] right
[1:37:11] a lot of times people think well you
[1:37:13] know because i say brother branham when
[1:37:14] i say the name brother brandon william
[1:37:16] branham
[1:37:17] that's gonna get me into heaven i'm
[1:37:18] sorry you're just as wrong as you can be
[1:37:22] god told nicodemus you must be born
[1:37:24] again
[1:37:25] that's the only way
[1:37:27] that kingdom that we're talking about
[1:37:28] christ you can't come there any kind of
[1:37:31] way you must die and wrought to yourself
[1:37:34] and and you know what that means get rid
[1:37:36] of all your pride and all of the things
[1:37:37] you think you've got you're holding on
[1:37:39] to you got to get rid of it
[1:37:42] a big price to pay
[1:37:44] but a small price to pay for eternal
[1:37:46] life
[1:37:49] he's got a place to meet them you know
[1:37:51] the bridegroom don't leave out nothing
[1:37:55] he's got the ring the identification
[1:37:57] he's got the robe that she wears her
[1:38:00] clothing see and he's got the provided
[1:38:02] place to meet her that is in the air
[1:38:05] everything has been all provided
[1:38:08] he's got the wedding
[1:38:11] softball already set
[1:38:14] guests already invited already chosen it
[1:38:17] makes you wonder how he come in 1963 he
[1:38:21] was he met us in the air he he literally
[1:38:24] showed us and that's just the beginning
[1:38:26] of of our change
[1:38:29] but you know what you got to come to a
[1:38:31] place where the divine nature and you
[1:38:33] can literally put you in a place to be
[1:38:36] can i say it like this teleport it
[1:38:40] translate it
[1:38:42] because you got to realize even the
[1:38:43] bride of jesus christ
[1:38:45] after the millennium
[1:38:47] after the burning of the whole world
[1:38:50] right
[1:38:51] what brother adam says
[1:38:54] god didn't translate us
[1:38:56] he transports us that means he'd take us
[1:38:59] from one place and bring us back to
[1:39:01] earth to fulfill
[1:39:03] the word of god that god told adam
[1:39:06] replenish the world
[1:39:08] or the earth
[1:39:10] and people looking at me like i'm crazy
[1:39:12] but i don't care
[1:39:14] i really don't
[1:39:16] you say well i don't know what you're
[1:39:17] preaching i don't you know i can't make
[1:39:19] you see what i see
[1:39:20] but i can truly tell you that i know
[1:39:22] that i'll give account for everything
[1:39:24] i'm saying
[1:39:25] and one thing i know is that that god is
[1:39:28] changing me
[1:39:31] amen
[1:39:32] i am not the same man i was a few months
[1:39:35] ago
[1:39:37] a few years
[1:39:38] ago i see the changes happening in me
[1:39:42] and i am absolutely excited about it
[1:39:46] because you know why
[1:39:47] because eventually this change
[1:39:50] is going to take bring me to a place
[1:39:53] it's going to bring me into a word body
[1:39:57] and that word body is going to bring me
[1:39:58] into a glorified body
[1:40:03] absolutely
[1:40:06] that's what this message came for
[1:40:08] brother said it would give you rapturing
[1:40:10] faith
[1:40:11] what is rapturing faith for jesus christ
[1:40:13] himself he said i am the resurrection
[1:40:16] and i am the life
[1:40:18] no man comes to the father but by me
[1:40:22] and jesus christ is christ
[1:40:26] cast out devils listen it's his kingdom
[1:40:30] and his order talking about a new world
[1:40:32] this is what he's trying to say listen
[1:40:34] let me say it like this what we see and
[1:40:36] understand about this world is going to
[1:40:39] be completely destroyed
[1:40:41] completely
[1:40:44] completely
[1:40:46] we don't even know the kind of body we
[1:40:48] getting ready we call it a glorified
[1:40:49] body we don't understand it
[1:40:52] but one thing i know brother brown said
[1:40:54] when he was a cross on the other side
[1:40:57] he said they don't even sleep
[1:41:02] they don't breathe
[1:41:05] they don't have to take breaths
[1:41:08] whatever body it is
[1:41:11] amen you can touch them you can feel if
[1:41:13] there's no sex glands in them
[1:41:16] and even all of that is going to be
[1:41:18] destroyed for the new one
[1:41:21] heaven and earth shall pass away
[1:41:24] this kingdom is beyond anything you and
[1:41:27] i can imagine
[1:41:29] the body that will have will be just
[1:41:31] like his and i'm going to close cl
[1:41:34] shortly because i i can see you getting
[1:41:35] tired but my point is this
[1:41:39] there's only one worthy and that's the
[1:41:41] lord jesus christ
[1:41:43] those 24 elders they they they they you
[1:41:47] know they put they threw their crowns
[1:41:49] down and said doll were they down worthy
[1:41:53] ah you're talking about quicken you got
[1:41:55] to be quickened and then that quickening
[1:41:57] will change you
[1:41:58] and that change will bring you to a
[1:42:00] translation
[1:42:02] that's the truth
[1:42:04] i i never saw it before like this but
[1:42:07] you know a translator what is he doing
[1:42:11] a translator when he takes french
[1:42:14] and take the concept of french
[1:42:16] and change it
[1:42:18] from french change it from
[1:42:20] one place to another into english that i
[1:42:22] might understand it or vice versa that's
[1:42:25] why we call it a translator
[1:42:28] he it's the same words
[1:42:30] but those words have changed place and
[1:42:33] position now it was with the man who was
[1:42:35] speaking french but now it's in me now
[1:42:42] right
[1:42:43] that's how translation works
[1:42:47] philip was moved from the revival to the
[1:42:49] desert and with no physical change
[1:42:53] as we know of
[1:42:56] which different
[1:42:58] than those
[1:42:59] bodies on mount transfiguration
[1:43:05] i don't understand it
[1:43:07] but i know they were in glorified bodies
[1:43:10] and the bodies were so glorified that
[1:43:13] the light of god shone
[1:43:15] bright brighter than the noonday sun
[1:43:22] and the disciples said when it was so
[1:43:24] impressive that you know they wanted to
[1:43:27] build three tabernacles
[1:43:30] all i know is this
[1:43:33] the bible tells me
[1:43:36] that the new jerusalem
[1:43:38] the new world
[1:43:40] won't need the light of the sun
[1:43:42] because the lamb is the light
[1:43:45] now you got to understand it ain't just
[1:43:47] talking about jesus the very g the very
[1:43:50] light of jesus will be a
[1:43:53] is that right am i mistaken oh let me
[1:43:56] read the scripture says
[1:43:57] and he carried me away into the spirit
[1:44:00] to a great and high mountain
[1:44:03] and showed me that a great that great
[1:44:06] city the holy jerusalem descending out
[1:44:09] of heaven from god doing what having the
[1:44:12] glory of god and her light
[1:44:17] like unto the stone most precious even
[1:44:20] like jasper clear as crystal
[1:44:24] what was it the very pillar of fire the
[1:44:27] very light of god is now shining through
[1:44:30] her
[1:44:33] guess what
[1:44:35] and her name
[1:44:36] is his name
[1:44:40] that's the word i'm closing on this
[1:44:43] because you know what sometimes we just
[1:44:44] don't understand what god is doing and
[1:44:46] has done for us we we wallow in our our
[1:44:50] shame and our sin and you know what you
[1:44:53] know the bible said you know that what
[1:44:55] god has done supposed to take away your
[1:44:57] guilt consciousness
[1:45:00] but we let the devil throw all these
[1:45:01] things on us as if god oh god didn't
[1:45:04] know i was going to mess up
[1:45:08] nothing you can do
[1:45:10] can ever change his mind about you
[1:45:13] god loved you from the beginning he
[1:45:16] loved you in eternity
[1:45:18] before and he loved you in eternity
[1:45:21] afterwards if that makes sense
[1:45:23] once god sealed you
[1:45:25] you know he can't change his mind he's
[1:45:27] perfect
[1:45:29] and what makes you love this message
[1:45:30] even though you know you can't live it
[1:45:33] for the very fact
[1:45:34] that he lived it for me
[1:45:37] i'm accepted in his beloved i'm accepted
[1:45:39] in his love
[1:45:40] you got to understand because i'm
[1:45:42] accepted god will bring the change
[1:45:46] there's not a tree
[1:45:48] or a flower or bush
[1:45:50] out there could ever brag on doing
[1:45:52] nothing
[1:45:54] everything
[1:45:55] that happens in a tree
[1:45:57] god makes it happen
[1:46:00] that tree can't say i worked hard today
[1:46:03] and i wanted plenty of fruits
[1:46:06] no
[1:46:07] everything that
[1:46:09] tree's potential was in the seed
[1:46:12] and all it had to do was stay in the
[1:46:14] presence of the sun
[1:46:16] and the sun brought it forth
[1:46:18] that sun represents god
[1:46:20] you stay in the word
[1:46:22] you might be a little slow at getting
[1:46:24] there but you'll get there
[1:46:28] god will bring you
[1:46:29] so much soul he said he never left one
[1:46:31] behind
[1:46:32] here's my clothes
[1:46:35] coming from the message exposition of
[1:46:37] the seven church ages
[1:46:40] i will write upon
[1:46:43] him the name of my god
[1:46:46] and the name of the city of my god
[1:46:51] and what is the name of god well
[1:46:54] he was god with us or emmanuel
[1:46:58] but that was not his given name
[1:47:01] thou shalt call his name jesus
[1:47:05] jesus said i came in my father's name
[1:47:08] and you received me not therefore the
[1:47:10] name of god is jesus
[1:47:13] for that is the name
[1:47:15] he came in
[1:47:17] he is lord jesus christ
[1:47:21] and what name does a woman take when she
[1:47:24] marry the man she takes his name
[1:47:27] it will be his name that is given unto
[1:47:30] the bride when he takes her to himself
[1:47:34] revelations 21 1-4 and i saw a new
[1:47:38] heaven and a new earth for the first
[1:47:40] heaven and the first earth was passed
[1:47:43] away and there was no more sea
[1:47:46] and i john saw the holy city jerusalem
[1:47:50] coming down from god out of heaven
[1:47:53] prepare as a bride adorned for her
[1:47:55] husband and i heard a great voice out of
[1:47:58] heaven saying behold the tabernacle of
[1:48:01] god is with men and he will dwell with
[1:48:04] them and they shall dwell they shall be
[1:48:07] his people now dwell means you
[1:48:08] understand that don't mean part-time
[1:48:10] living
[1:48:11] that means he dwells there that's his
[1:48:13] habitation and god himself shall be with
[1:48:16] them and be their god and god shall wipe
[1:48:19] away all tears from their eyes and they
[1:48:22] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[1:48:25] nor crying neither there shall be any
[1:48:27] more pain for the former things are
[1:48:30] passed away
[1:48:31] we can't imagine that how wonderful
[1:48:34] all of god's wonderful promises
[1:48:36] fulfilled it will be all over
[1:48:40] the change will have been completed
[1:48:44] that's when the change is completed but
[1:48:46] right now we're in the process of
[1:48:48] completing it
[1:48:51] the lamb and his bride forever settled
[1:48:54] in all the perfection of god
[1:48:57] y'all believe what i'm saying
[1:48:59] do y'all believe
[1:49:01] what we're reading
[1:49:05] describe it
[1:49:07] who is able to do that no one
[1:49:10] think about it
[1:49:11] dream about it read what the word says
[1:49:14] about it yes we can do all that
[1:49:17] yet we can only know an in infinite and
[1:49:22] uh infinite some
[1:49:24] infinitesimal part of it until it
[1:49:26] becomes reality in the first
[1:49:28] resurrection so we just
[1:49:31] just get little small pieces of what's
[1:49:33] really happening and you know i tell you
[1:49:36] what what really encourages me
[1:49:38] people get about thomas
[1:49:40] doubting thomas
[1:49:42] you know
[1:49:44] but one thing about thomas
[1:49:46] he got it
[1:49:49] he may have had oh lord let me put you
[1:49:52] see god works with you he knows how he
[1:49:54] made you
[1:49:57] so he works with you
[1:49:59] everybody's different
[1:50:02] and god will work with you according to
[1:50:04] your makeup
[1:50:09] but with that being said
[1:50:12] at some point in time that has to change
[1:50:16] because your nature must die
[1:50:21] and thomas had not gone to pentecost yet
[1:50:26] the nature was still living
[1:50:32] he said no one think about it dream
[1:50:34] about it read what the word says about
[1:50:37] it yes
[1:50:38] we can do all of that yet we can only
[1:50:41] know an intermissible invincible
[1:50:45] uh part
[1:50:46] mo of it's until it becomes reality in
[1:50:49] the first resurrection here you go and i
[1:50:52] will write my new name upon him my new
[1:50:56] name
[1:50:57] when all becomes new
[1:50:59] then he will take upon him a new name
[1:51:02] and that name will be the name of the
[1:51:05] bride also
[1:51:07] what that name is
[1:51:10] none dare conjecture
[1:51:12] it would have to be a revelation of the
[1:51:14] spirit given
[1:51:16] so conclusively that none would dare
[1:51:19] deny it
[1:51:21] but no doubt
[1:51:22] he will lead that revelation
[1:51:25] to the day
[1:51:26] when he desired to give that name forth
[1:51:29] suffice it no that uh suffice it to know
[1:51:33] that it will be more wonderful
[1:51:37] than we could ever imagine
[1:51:41] so let us not be deceived i'm going to
[1:51:44] stop there
[1:51:50] what made you a man
[1:51:53] what made you a woman
[1:51:57] why did you become why did you arrive in
[1:52:00] here as a horse or a dog
[1:52:02] or a cat or a pig
[1:52:04] or a butterfly or
[1:52:06] an ant or a worm
[1:52:09] you've got to realize that all those
[1:52:11] manifestations they were thoughts of god
[1:52:16] they didn't just happened
[1:52:20] and what what made you
[1:52:22] who you are
[1:52:25] why the life of god was given to you
[1:52:28] when millions upon millions of babies
[1:52:30] didn't make it
[1:52:33] and why why did god put you in a place
[1:52:37] which is the greatest message that ever
[1:52:39] struck the earth why did he put you put
[1:52:42] that in your face
[1:52:46] and then he comes along and tells you
[1:52:48] law and grace does not mix
[1:52:53] you struggle with laws then you're gonna
[1:52:56] you're gonna find yourself miserable
[1:52:59] if you don't believe that god has
[1:53:01] justified you as though you haven't
[1:53:03] sinned in the first place see because a
[1:53:04] true believer
[1:53:08] he doesn't wake to a week to confess
[1:53:12] as soon as he make mistakes he said
[1:53:13] father forgive me lord i'm sorry
[1:53:16] and his
[1:53:18] his mind is to live it
[1:53:20] because that's the christ in it
[1:53:23] like babies you know they don't mean to
[1:53:24] fall but they fall they don't mean to
[1:53:26] stumble but they stumble
[1:53:28] but they steal children they steal
[1:53:30] babies
[1:53:32] and a lot of times you know we think we
[1:53:34] all grown
[1:53:36] but your actions give you away
[1:53:42] the bible said you know
[1:53:44] we need to look at ourselves see whether
[1:53:46] we stand in the faith
[1:53:50] the bible is there for our correction
[1:53:52] it's there to let us see where how far
[1:53:54] we're it's our measuring stick
[1:53:58] it's christ in you
[1:54:01] this nine talking about human effort
[1:54:04] that's the problem
[1:54:06] systematically we we work with human
[1:54:08] effort that's not what i'm talking about
[1:54:12] it ain't about your human effort that
[1:54:14] changes you
[1:54:15] you can look so righteous and so holy
[1:54:17] and you're righteous there will be
[1:54:18] filthy rags in the eyes of god
[1:54:21] we need god to change us
[1:54:24] that's why brother branham says lay in
[1:54:26] the presence of the son
[1:54:28] let this word bake all the green out of
[1:54:30] you bring that change to you without you
[1:54:32] trying to muster it up and work it up
[1:54:34] and bump it up and whatever up you can
[1:54:36] do with it because that's not it
[1:54:39] that's coming to trust what you hear
[1:54:41] and believe that he that begun the good
[1:54:43] work in you is faithful to complete it
[1:54:45] it's coming to a place to to recognize i
[1:54:48] am bright regardless to how faulty you
[1:54:50] may be
[1:54:51] now a revival for the bride is what it
[1:54:53] is happening now because we've had so
[1:54:55] much trash left in our lives amen and we
[1:54:59] picked up a lot of trash from from uh uh
[1:55:02] laodicea you know god has to clean us up
[1:55:05] this is what i call the bride revival
[1:55:08] god getting all the trash out of our
[1:55:09] lives so that he can really fill us like
[1:55:12] he wants us and want to and live in us
[1:55:14] like he want to live in us
[1:55:17] you know people are you
[1:55:19] uh let me tell you let me say this in
[1:55:21] closing
[1:55:24] what are the
[1:55:25] uh scriptures that have always stuck
[1:55:28] with me
[1:55:29] uh
[1:55:30] perhaps more than any
[1:55:33] and that scripture says
[1:55:36] only the pure in heart
[1:55:39] shall see god
[1:55:43] and i work very hard to keep my heart
[1:55:45] pure
[1:55:48] just the other day i was very angry at
[1:55:50] something that took place
[1:55:52] in my household i was very angry i said
[1:55:54] my house were among my family
[1:55:57] and i just got
[1:55:58] more angry that i haven't i can't even
[1:56:01] tell you how it's been
[1:56:03] i would say tons of years before since
[1:56:06] i've been that angry i i i just can't
[1:56:09] explain it
[1:56:10] i didn't even know i could get there i
[1:56:12] thought all of that part of me was dead
[1:56:16] but i went to the
[1:56:19] cold stone and
[1:56:21] i took my grandson there
[1:56:24] and um that little they had a little
[1:56:26] fella there looked like he was just
[1:56:29] down talking me you know a little young
[1:56:31] boy
[1:56:33] and and i'm thinking you know this fella
[1:56:35] need to have a little more respect talk
[1:56:37] to me better than what he's talking now
[1:56:39] you got to understand
[1:56:41] i was not in the holy ghost
[1:56:44] i was not in the right spirit
[1:56:46] so whatever i was going to hear was
[1:56:49] going to always
[1:56:50] you know when you're in god
[1:56:52] no matter how weird
[1:56:53] or how wicked a person talk with you you
[1:56:56] could still get some sweetness out of it
[1:56:59] but when it came to this guy i i got
[1:57:02] real snappy snappy snappy and you know i
[1:57:05] left out of that restaurant feeling
[1:57:07] pretty bad
[1:57:08] you know what i
[1:57:10] because i knew
[1:57:11] i was going to have to go back and
[1:57:12] confess
[1:57:14] i was going to have to make it right
[1:57:17] and you know what i did
[1:57:18] not just that uh i told it when i was
[1:57:22] down there and i would see the same
[1:57:24] little story
[1:57:25] but just the other day i walked in that
[1:57:28] restaurant i didn't need no ice cream
[1:57:30] but i got some anyway
[1:57:35] i got a big thing of vanilla
[1:57:38] and that's i think if i anyway
[1:57:42] so
[1:57:43] still haven't eaten any of it yet
[1:57:45] but i went in there to apologize that
[1:57:47] was a purpose
[1:57:48] and you know what's so funny about it i
[1:57:52] asked i told that guy in the face of
[1:57:53] everybody that was there i didn't care
[1:57:55] who was in there i told him young man i
[1:57:57] said
[1:57:58] i really owe you an apology i said i
[1:58:00] came in here the other day i was in a
[1:58:02] bad spirit i was not in
[1:58:04] in the right spirit and i was really
[1:58:05] snappy and
[1:58:07] disrespectful
[1:58:08] uh you know what he said
[1:58:10] well i didn't even notice it
[1:58:13] i said i'm so glad you did
[1:58:16] but i said i had a need
[1:58:18] to ask you for your forgiveness
[1:58:21] and then i went to
[1:58:23] to pay my bill i tried to give him five
[1:58:26] dollars and rejected it
[1:58:28] i had the money on the card but whatever
[1:58:30] happened
[1:58:32] it didn't happen so i had to do it again
[1:58:34] and i said well did you get the five
[1:58:35] dollars on there
[1:58:36] he says no
[1:58:38] but i said you know i said in my mind
[1:58:41] maybe the next time when i come but i
[1:58:43] took that five dollars as my own grace
[1:58:46] that god gave me grace see you you you
[1:58:50] you can't be somebody
[1:58:53] how could i say it
[1:58:55] that boy didn't even look like a
[1:58:56] christian i don't know but maybe one day
[1:58:58] he will be
[1:59:02] and he'll know amen that that there are
[1:59:05] those who are kind everybody is not mean
[1:59:08] i don't know what god was doing in his
[1:59:09] life
[1:59:11] but then there was another man back
[1:59:12] there that i normally see and he came
[1:59:15] out after that all was said and done and
[1:59:18] he's seen me he knows i'm a preacher and
[1:59:20] all that
[1:59:22] and we talked and stuff like that but i
[1:59:24] don't know who that was for
[1:59:27] but sometimes when you think you're
[1:59:28] wrong
[1:59:30] and you are sometimes it looks like
[1:59:32] you're in the wrong place at the right
[1:59:33] time
[1:59:35] god turns it out for your good
[1:59:38] honestly i felt so good after i had it i
[1:59:41] mean the ice cream and all of that was
[1:59:43] you know my delight but my point is i
[1:59:45] felt so clean
[1:59:47] after i confessed to that young man
[1:59:50] that's the kind of person god has
[1:59:52] changed me
[1:59:53] into because you know there was a time
[1:59:55] you know what i would say just like
[1:59:57] everybody else oh he'll get over it
[2:00:00] but that's not
[2:00:02] everything you go through every stumble
[2:00:04] every fall
[2:00:05] everything that has been orchestrated in
[2:00:07] your life is for you
[2:00:10] and god expects you to correct it
[2:00:13] y'all i say it like this in closing
[2:00:16] remember brother branham i think he
[2:00:18] brought something over the border
[2:00:21] and i forgot how many miles away he was
[2:00:23] from the mexico border and he turned all
[2:00:27] the way back round and took it back
[2:00:29] because he said he didn't have it
[2:00:32] how many of y'all would have done that
[2:00:38] now i'm laughing but you know what that
[2:00:40] takes god character
[2:00:42] that takes pleasing god
