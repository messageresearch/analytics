[7:32] you all the praise the glory and honor
[7:34] in the precious name of Jesus Christ we
[7:37] pray and we thank you
[7:40] amen amen as we we enter
[7:45] into Book of Proverbs
[7:58] 29
[8:09] and Proverbs
[8:12] 29 and
[8:14] verse Verse 18 Proverbs 29 Verse
[8:19] 18 where there is no vision the people
[8:24] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[8:28] is he
[8:31] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[8:32] readings of his words you may be
[8:35] seated
[8:37] amen say where there is no vision the
[8:40] people perish but he that keepeth the
[8:43] law happy is
[8:46] he amen we want
[8:49] to speak a little on the
[8:53] vision amen the
[8:56] vision amen you know you could study
[9:00] you can have 50 sermons amen you could
[9:03] study for days and weeks yes sir we just
[9:06] want God's inspiration amen we want the
[9:09] Lord to have his way we can have we
[9:10] could have many notes yes sir we could
[9:12] have quotes we could have many
[9:15] scriptures written out amen but we just
[9:17] want God to be on the scene to bless our
[9:21] hearts to meet our every needs amen cuz
[9:23] that's what it's all about it's not
[9:25] about our own thoughts but his thoughts
[9:28] it's not about our own ways but his ways
[9:31] it's not our own will but his will amen
[9:34] amen so so pray for us this morning amen
[9:37] we're glad to be here we've been having
[9:39] a wonderful time in Fellowship amen it's
[9:42] been joyous to be here amen so so here
[9:46] we see that in the word of
[9:48] God we we we read that in the Amplified
[9:52] and they they interpret it in Hebrew the
[9:55] meaning of without a vision the people
[9:58] perish
[9:59] I left my little Amplified Bible back
[10:02] there on the desk but it it says uh
[10:06] without a Redemptive
[10:09] Revelation the people perish
[10:12] amen so we must understand Redemption
[10:16] amen cuz we are in Redemption amen
[10:20] praise the Lord aren't you glad and
[10:22] redeem it means to buy back oh praise
[10:26] the Living God so so Christ Jesus God
[10:30] through his Mercy knew that the law
[10:33] required a Kinsman amen so with that God
[10:39] there was a lamb we know slain before
[10:41] the foundation of the world to redeem us
[10:43] back to buy us back so here God first
[10:48] amen had the vision amen when he was
[10:51] Elohim before he was even God he was
[10:54] Elohim self-existent always was so in
[10:58] his mind he had a vision he had a
[11:00] Redemptive plan he had a Redemptive
[11:03] Vision amen and in Christ The Mystery of
[11:06] God revealed we know as the prophet
[11:08] taught us God wanted to reveal himself
[11:10] in Christ he wanted to get the prence
[11:14] out of our life and restored the kingdom
[11:16] to his rightly position amen so the
[11:20] vision is on a she glad
[11:23] amen my I get
[11:27] excited
[11:33] so what do we see
[11:35] here see we know way before what the
[11:38] 1920s I believe when television came out
[11:42] that's then but God had Vision way
[11:44] before
[11:46] that amen or they call we call it hell
[11:51] Vision praise the Lord so what do we see
[11:55] as as we look into the word of God even
[11:58] uh there in the book of Isaiah and
[12:01] Isaiah 6 he saw a vision he saw a vision
[12:04] of of how it was and how even he
[12:08] described said how even the
[12:11] seams one of the seams took a live coold
[12:15] and touched his tongue and he said Wars
[12:17] me a man undone a man with unclean lips
[12:21] the vision had an effect on isah oh and
[12:24] when you see this Vision it has an
[12:26] effect on you hey man was oh bless his
[12:30] wonderful name so what do we see we see
[12:33] that uh that even habca habaka said and
[12:37] that word vision and habaka it means the
[12:40] same thing in um uh Proverbs 29 habaka
[12:44] said in habaka 2 and one I will stand
[12:46] upon my watch and I will watch what he's
[12:49] saying to me and he said write the
[12:51] vision make it plain upon tables that he
[12:54] may run that RI it for the vision is yet
[12:57] for an appointed time
[12:59] but at the end it shall
[13:02] speak though it t wait for it it will
[13:05] surely come it would not
[13:07] ter so even habca and if you notice from
[13:11] habca 2 Paul got the revelation of that
[13:14] in Hebrews 10 uh verses
[13:17] 37-39 and Paul called now habac called
[13:20] division
[13:22] it but Paul came and called that Vision
[13:25] Christ amen so the vision is Christ amen
[13:28] Hallelujah and Christ is the anointed
[13:30] word amen Christ is the very Heart Of
[13:34] God oh so it's God's
[13:37] desire oh I'm I'm glad to be a part of
[13:39] his his vision his eternal thoughts amen
[13:42] you know God have eternal thoughts and
[13:44] he have created thoughts Elohim so I'm
[13:47] glad to be a part of his eternal
[13:49] thoughts you were chosen in him before
[13:52] the foundation of the world so when you
[13:54] see the vision you must run that word
[13:57] run it means to make haste don't it It
[14:00] Don't Come Easy you don't come half
[14:02] stepping it means to make haste it's a
[14:06] matter of life and death once you see
[14:08] the vision and back then they had to
[14:10] write it on tables of stone they had to
[14:13] write it uh large and clear on tables of
[14:16] stone that when people walked by they
[14:19] saw it clear it was no in other
[14:22] words you didn't had to figure it out it
[14:25] was so plain and and now he's showing us
[14:29] plainly division amen remember the Lord
[14:32] Jesus said many things I could tell you
[14:34] not can bear them now but the time come
[14:37] in that day now the prophet interpreted
[14:40] that he said that day is this day I will
[14:43] show you plainly of the father I will
[14:45] show you show you plainly of the word of
[14:47] God so the word of God is being made
[14:50] plain amen right division make it plain
[14:53] upon tables and now he's writing that
[14:56] Vision plain Upon Our Hearts amen not
[14:59] with ink but by the blood by the spirit
[15:02] of Christ oh he's making it he's writing
[15:05] that Vision in our hearts it's read in
[15:07] our hearts we are reading the pists
[15:09] known and read of our men and what it
[15:12] it's the word quicken in our hearts
[15:15] aren't you glad the letter kth but the
[15:18] spirit giveth life you know some people
[15:20] criticize me cuz I love the
[15:23] spirit I love the spirit quicking word
[15:25] amen amen the is the blood of Christ by
[15:29] the spirit praise the Lord I I don't you
[15:33] know he call us to be on fire brother

[15:41] to stay on fire for God Amen praise the
[15:45] Living God you must be the Revival I
[15:48] tell people don't look for the Revival
[15:50] I'm the Revival ammen the Bri Revival is
[15:53] on now don't wait on the squeeze the
[15:56] squeeze is already on anyway it's
[15:58] gradually happening it could take a year
[16:01] it could take five years it could take
[16:03] 20 years but the squeeze is on and it
[16:06] gradually tightens down amen praise the
[16:09] Living God I want to tell you the
[16:10] squeeze is on you see what's happening
[16:12] out there amen Kenneth Copeland Roman
[16:16] Catholic Church all those things the the
[16:17] four blood moons all those things we're
[16:20] not setting the date it could be 20
[16:22] years from now but one thing we know the
[16:25] squeeze is on now another thing we know
[16:28] that BR reviv is on
[16:30] now remember invisible Union yes sir the
[16:34] move is on now for the BR amen back then
[16:39] when this five planets lined up it was
[16:41] the bride in her emphasis St but
[16:45] now stage of maturity that's where we're
[16:48] at praise the Living God so the vision
[16:52] is being made plain amen we have to move
[16:55] at the vision we can't sit still it's
[16:58] time to be desperate or perish cuz
[17:01] there's coming forth something with the
[17:02] Lord and if we don't be desperate it'll
[17:05] pass through us it's a matter of life
[17:07] and death the token must be applied you
[17:10] know we preach back home a little
[17:12] message call it's house cleaning time I

[17:18] ghost that there's house cleaning time
[17:20] everything got to be clear you you can't
[17:23] have any alts in your heart if you have
[17:25] any alts against your parents against

[17:29] against anyone your boss man whoever you
[17:32] got to get it right you got to forget
[17:34] all those
[17:36] things you have to you can't even enter
[17:39] into this if you can't get those things
[17:41] right because forgiveness is the
[17:43] foundation of Faith
[17:45] amen faith is based on forgiveness so it
[17:48] have to be a Clear Channel if if it's
[17:51] not clear you can't even hear from God
[17:53] it'll pass right through you so it's
[17:56] important that we lay the foundation
[17:58] amen it got to be laid right you know I
[18:01] believe the whole word of God is deep
[18:04] from from Genesis to Revelation from
[18:06] Calvary to now it's all deep because the
[18:09] foundation must be deep Jesus say he
[18:12] that digs the foundation in Luke 6 he
[18:15] must dig deep first amen so praise the
[18:19] Living God and the spirit of God
[18:20] searches the Deep things of God bless
[18:23] this wonderful
[18:25] name praise the Lord so what do we see
[18:28] we who were he out HED out just like
[18:32] Israel we were hewed out by a prophet a
[18:35] Vindicated Prophet regardless what
[18:38] anybody else say I thank God for Elijah
[18:41] amen I thank God for Malachi 4 He Man it
[18:45] came to turn our hearts back to the
[18:46] origin of Faith aren't you glad amen you
[18:50] know I was in a Baptist Church didn't
[18:52] know what a prophet was didn't know who
[18:54] Elijah was but they taught us as as
[18:56] young people read MTH Mark Luke and John
[18:59] so here in Matthew I was it stayed in my
[19:03] mind Matthew 17: 10 and 11 here I'm in a
[19:06] Baptist Church looking for
[19:09] Elijah yeah looking for Elijah to come
[19:12] didn't know who it was going to be but
[19:14] one of the brothers had witnessed to me
[19:16] hold up a church a book he said you
[19:18] remember the Bible said Elijah should
[19:20] come F first come and restore all things
[19:22] I said yes he said this is him that all
[19:24] it took because that what I was looking
[19:25] for amen I didn't know who would be amen
[19:29] Mary knew in her heart when she read
[19:32] Isaiah 7:14 when she read that something
[19:35] came over her she kept wondering and she
[19:38] puted it in her heart amen but one day
[19:41] click amen that's what made the
[19:44] difference and she said be it unto me
[19:46] according to Thy word aren't you glad
[19:49] see that's the secret as the word was in
[19:51] Mary so shall it be in you aren't you
[19:54] glad and when the Holy Ghost Quicken
[19:56] that word it gives you you a Clear
[19:59] Vision of what it's all about so I thank
[20:02] God for this Redemptive
[20:05] Revelation amen the gospel didn't come
[20:08] in word only but in power Amen in
[20:11] demonstration and the prophet wanted to
[20:13] say not just demonstration he said but
[20:15] the Holy Ghost In Action upon the word
[20:18] of God amen amen and oh God and think of
[20:24] that if God could have call give us
[20:26] anything better to defeat the than his
[20:28] word he would have so the word of God
[20:32] shall and will defeat the enemy any time
[20:37] any place anywhere even on his own
[20:40] ground ammen because Jesus Christ he
[20:44] conquer death H in the grave now I love
[20:46] the brag on the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[20:48] don't
[20:49] you he went down into hell he he I
[20:53] believe he's a gentleman yes sir he may
[20:55] have knocked on the
[20:57] door but he took the keys of hell and
[21:00] death you know the prophet said he
[21:02] slapped him and said give me those keys
[21:05] said I'm the boss amen so the devil
[21:08] don't even have the keys to his own
[21:10] house and amen he don't have the keys to
[21:13] his own
[21:15] house and you don't even have to argue
[21:17] with the devil you know when Satan went
[21:22] he went to Michael disputing the Lord's
[21:26] body amen CU see Michael
[21:29] H has a is a sign one of the works of
[21:32] Michael is he have authority over the
[21:35] resurrection power Satan didn't go to
[21:37] Gabriel he didn't go to Wormwood he went
[21:40] to Michael disputing of Moses body but
[21:45] Michael didn't even argue with him he
[21:47] just told him the Lord rebuke thee ammen
[21:50] so you don't have to argue with the
[21:52] devil Hallelujah I said you don't have
[21:54] to AR with the devil amen just tell the
[21:57] devil it's written tell the devil the
[22:00] Lord rebuke thee serve noce on the devil
[22:04] amen why we have authority amen the
[22:07] bride don't have to resume we have the
[22:09] actual Authority praise the lord we who
[22:13] are in Christ we have to act your
[22:15] Authority we don't have to beat at the
[22:17] air amen when the Lord Jesus was on the
[22:20] cross in St John 19 he verse 30 when he
[22:24] say it is finished it's done he spoke
[22:28] this day he spoke of all of it when he
[22:30] say it is finished you know in Hebrew
[22:33] that word it is finished that phrase it
[22:36] is called the Victor's cry oh she glad
[22:40] Hallelujah the Victor's cry why because
[22:44] the Victor Cried

[23:25] amen praise the Living God amen I don't
[23:28] know if I'm going to get into my
[23:31] M praise the
[23:33] Lord so what do we see a prophet is a
[23:37] Divine interpreter of the word of God
[23:40] he's the mouthpiece of God he he he
[23:43] brings God on the scene to the people we
[23:47] know a priest takes the people to
[23:50] God but a prophet brings God to the
[23:53] people oh praise the Living God you know
[23:57] in the old test test up before the blood
[24:00] of
[24:02] Christ and
[24:04] even now as the prophet taught us he
[24:08] said now notice we know the different
[24:11] angels have their works the cherums of
[24:14] course we know Michael is Christ in
[24:17] Angelic Rim Revelation
[24:19] 10:1 Michael that's
[24:22] Christ when Danel
[24:25] prayed for 21 days Gabriel came Gabriel
[24:29] said I heard you when you first
[24:30] prayed but the this demon now and the
[24:33] Prince of Persia withstood me in that
[24:36] Dimension but Michael came and helped me
[24:38] out to get the Revelation to Daniel and
[24:41] make Daniel understand the
[24:44] vision but then we see that Cher uh
[24:47] wormwood controls the
[24:49] waters Gabel mainly Gabriel always to
[24:53] deal with
[24:54] Israel but Gabriel announced the first
[24:57] coming he will announce the second
[24:58] coming but what do we see but then now
[25:01] the cherums they guard the way of the
[25:05] throne but now the serams they have a
[25:08] different work they're burners at the
[25:10] altar and the seams take a sinner's
[25:13] prayer because a sinner is is too dirty
[25:16] to enter into the presence of God so
[25:19] that seram takes the the sinner's prayer
[25:22] and presents it to
[25:23] God but now we as Sons Daughters of God
[25:28] we don't need a Ser from to work for us
[25:30] anymore you Born Again In Christ you
[25:32] could talk to God yourself amen that's
[25:35] what the blood is done you can talk to
[25:38] God yourself but you must be on speaking
[25:41] terms you can't live any kind of life
[25:44] you got to be on speaking terms first
[25:46] with God and you can talk to him
[25:48] yourself that's the authority amen and
[25:52] the prophet taught us he's a he asked
[25:54] the question who have more Authority
[25:58] that's the Angels who are sitting in the
[26:00] presence of God or a sinner a son and
[26:03] daughter of God saved by grace he said
[26:05] Son and Daughter of God saved by grace
[26:08] have more Authority than the angels of
[26:10] God who are in the presence of God we
[26:12] have more Authority am but what did he
[26:15] say he said but they afraid to use it
[26:17] you see oh we must recognize who we are
[26:22] amen it's truth you
[26:26] know
[26:30] and we know the highest
[26:32] order is God revealing his word through
[26:35] a
[26:38] prophet Amos 3 and 7 Malachi 45 and 6
[26:42] Revelation 10: 7 but we see Israel
[26:46] Israel had Grace
[26:48] first even in Egypt Grace came to him
[26:51] but Israel as the prophet taught us the
[26:54] greatest mistake Israel ever made Israel
[26:58] chose law of Grace they wanted to put
[27:01] their own self some work in it amen but
[27:03] they had nothing to do with it that's
[27:06] right cuz God had already promised
[27:10] amen he' already promised Abraham that
[27:14] your seed shall sojourn in a land a
[27:17] Strange Land for 400 years and afterward
[27:20] I will deliver them he' already gave the
[27:23] promise to Abraham say Abraham if you
[27:25] count the Dust encounter the Stars so
[27:30] should I see you oh God you're stars of
[27:33] God you know you know I could have been
[27:35] a basketball star I had it all the way
[27:39] could have made Plenty Money playing
[27:40] basketball but I'm glad to be a star of
[27:43] God aren't you glad hey man you got
[27:46] movie stars you have Hollywood stars you

[27:51] those stars but you're the greatest star

[27:58] glad where was thou when I laid the
[28:02] foundation but we can say I was there I
[28:05] was with him I was in his thoughts I was
[28:08] a part of God am and the greatest thing
[28:11] I cannot be lost no more than God
[28:13] himself could be lost because I know who
[28:16] I am amen you got to see who you
[28:22] are the one little boy remember the
[28:25] story the one little boy walked up the
[28:27] step
[28:28] when he walked up Faith virtue knowledge
[28:30] Tempest pris God really kindness he seen
[28:32] himself in the mirror amen but the other
[28:35] little boy was psyching himself out
[28:37] trying to anyway he was afraid he was
[28:39] walking through the
[28:40] graveyard he was among the dead walking
[28:44] through the graveyard he was trying to
[28:47] pych himself out that he was not afraid
[28:50] but he was afraid and God come to take
[28:53] away our fear Hallelujah to show us who
[28:56] we really are amen Heen that we could
[28:59] that as our brother quoted this morning
[29:02] one could put a th a flight two could
[29:04] put 10,000 oh look how many in here we
[29:07] could put many Devils on the r right now
[29:10] don't you know the devil is afraid of
[29:13] you remember the sto Prophet told the
[29:15] story about the the devil that was
[29:18] booing to this guy this brother he the
[29:22] more he booed he got
[29:25] smaller the more the devil boo him he
[29:27] got
[29:29] smaller but then later he decided to boo
[29:31] back amen so when he boo back he got
[29:35] bigger the devil got
[29:37] smaller he booed the devil got smaller
[29:40] yeah he realized something and then as
[29:43] the prophet went on to say he said the
[29:45] devil is afraid of that blood and that
[29:49] word keep in mind the devil is afraid of
[29:53] that blood and that word he he's afraid
[29:56] of it so Satan is more afraid of you
[30:00] than you think he is all these things
[30:03] though a thousand may fall at your side
[30:05] in 10,000 at your right hand none of
[30:08] those things will come near you because

[30:16] glad for the blood oh there's power in
[30:18] the blood and the blood never loses it
[30:21] power it puts every demon on the run it

[30:49] thoughts praise the Living God you can
[30:52] cast them all down and recognize Who You
[30:56] Are
[30:58] praise the Living God bless his
[31:00] wonderful name we see that even uh we

[31:32] and bad Health don't profit I rather
[31:36] have good health than all the money in

[32:08] basis and it's worse when a person have
[32:11] as basis and smoke cigarettes it's devil
[32:16] worst but but anyway he said what
[32:20] happens he showed it on a
[32:22] microscope and he
[32:24] said now these white blood cells
[32:27] when when when any foreign object comes
[32:29] in the body those white blood cells they
[32:33] are at tension they're
[32:36] watching and when a foreign object comes
[32:39] to the
[32:40] body those white blood cells Rush that
[32:43] foreign object to protect the rest of
[32:45] the body so it would not spread so it
[32:47] builds a wall around that affected
[32:51] area and then but what happens is when
[32:54] the foreign object comes they're like
[32:57] soldiers but they the form changes of
[33:00] those the white blood cells form changes
[33:02] to swords shape of swords and go after
[33:05] that object I said man how Mighty God is
[33:11] amen man and you know the prophet told
[33:14] us brother Bram he said now notice he
[33:16] said those white blood cells are God's
[33:19] Army he said when you see the white PFF
[33:22] it represents many of those white blood
[33:25] cells has given their life
[33:27] for the body to save the body amen
[33:31] Christ gave his life to save the body he
[33:34] sent the sword of the word for
[33:36] protection of glad amen you see how
[33:39] powerful God is my he's so powerful and
[33:43] they said the while the white blood
[33:44] cells are going to fight that area then
[33:47] the red blood cells are sending messages
[33:49] to the brain produce more white blood
[33:51] cells
[33:53] hallelujah
[33:55] hallelujah oh god there are more with us
[33:59] than with them hallelujah we're
[34:02] Victorious amen we cannot be defeated
[34:06] we've got the power in the name of the
[34:09] Lord amen hey we can boast in the Lord
[34:13] amen we're not boasting in ourselves
[34:15] we're boasting in the Lord It's he that
[34:17] doeth the work Jesus said not I that
[34:20] doth the work the flesh has nothing to
[34:22] do with it but my father that dwelleth
[34:24] in me he doeth the work amen it's not by
[34:28] might nor by power but by my spirit said
[34:31] the Lord he is doing the work we just
[34:34] have to realize it's him doing the work
[34:36] we just have to year to him hallelujah
[34:38] praise the Living
[34:39] God you know the prophet said I'm afraid
[34:42] we're getting too me too many to church
[34:45] and not to Christ This is not enough if
[34:48] you're a church member something is
[34:49] wrong amen I'm not a church member now
[34:52] I'm a member of the body of Christ but
[34:55] I'm not a church member not a church
[34:57] members didn't made it if you go back in
[34:59] the numbers the church members didn't
[35:01] make it in the promised land
[35:03] amen the church members heard the shout
[35:06] yes sir the church members is called out
[35:09] assembly yes the church they were called
[35:11] out but remember we know Redemption
[35:14] comes in two parts yes sir out of and
[35:16] into amen that's right that's right he
[35:21] said we're getting them to church and
[35:22] not to Christ amen we're getting them to
[35:25] the prophet but not to Christ now I
[35:29] believe Malachi 4 I know the word is
[35:32] right sir but we've given them to a
[35:35] prophet and not the Christ it's the
[35:37] truth now amen but John now John had the
[35:40] spirit of Elijah and John said Behold
[35:43] the Lamb of God now the Lamb of God
[35:45] today Hallelujah is the word the revered
[35:49] word we're not feasting on the words of
[35:51] a man but we're feasted on the bleeding
[35:53] body word of the son of man Jesus Christ
[35:57] Christ amen so John being a prophet a
[36:00] true Prophet a scripture Prophet pointed
[36:02] the people to Christ the anointed word
[36:06] and the prophet taught us he said the
[36:08] Messiah is the word of God in full amen
[36:12] amen so the Messiah is on us now amen
[36:16] amen praise the Living God that's why
[36:19] the seals had to be
[36:21] open not just six Seals All Seven Seals
[36:26] had to be open amen amen because the
[36:28] seven seal is the coming of the
[36:30] Lord
[36:33] amen we in this dispensation here the
[36:36] coming of the Lord in this it was the
[36:40] coming of the Lord in
[36:42] Genesis
[36:43] right with Adam and Eve in
[36:48] Genesis 18 it was a
[36:51] coming to Abraham and Sarah in Exodus 3
[36:56] there there was a coming I've heard
[36:58] their cries I've seen their Affliction
[37:00] and I am come down to deliver them so
[37:03] there was a coming of the
[37:06] Lord amen but now in this end time
[37:09] course it was a coming 2,000 years ago
[37:12] amen but now there's a coming and this
[37:15] coming is a three-fold coming amen first
[37:18] Thessalonians 4 shout the Lord himself
[37:22] so descend from heaven with a shout
[37:24] what's a shout in the prophet is it it's
[37:27] a message to what to gather the
[37:30] bride so the Lord himself shall come
[37:32] with a shout now we're not we know the
[37:34] litc coming is different I believe in
[37:36] the litc coming I believe in those
[37:38] bloody hands and those nail scar side I
[37:41] believe in it we'll see that throughout
[37:44] eternity yes
[37:47] sir but the voice the voice of our Angel
[37:51] is Christ in you the hope of glory and
[37:54] then the trump it calls us to the feast
[37:58] in the sky now we're not going to the to
[38:01] the to the marriage right we're going to
[38:04] the supper amen that's why the prophet
[38:06] spoke the invisible Union of the r of
[38:09] Christ showing that there must be an
[38:11] invisible union now Christ in you that's
[38:15] the invisible Union which takes you to
[38:17] the marriage supper and who all going
[38:19] have that Christ in them they will be
[38:22] the son you know you know there's you
[38:25] know one's called the lamb supper that
[38:28] we're going to but then those that are
[38:30] left
[38:32] behind will not rejoicing in us but
[38:35] those that are left behind will be the
[38:37] supper which is called God's supper so
[38:39] it's two different suppers so if we eat
[38:42] the
[38:44] book it shows that we're going to that
[38:47] wedding supper the supper of the Lamb
[38:50] I'm looking forward to that that's my
[38:52] vision you know some people are throwing
[38:55] canned goods under the house
[38:57] waiting on the Great Tribulation that's
[38:59] where their faith is that's not wrapped
[39:01] in faith I believe amen if I need
[39:05] something he's going to anoint me to
[39:06] speak it that's wrapped in faith cuz God
[39:09] going to allow the third po
[39:11] manifestation in your life my now I'm
[39:13] getting this afternoon
[39:16] message I had it this afternoon
[39:19] message but God knows all
[39:23] things we love the
[39:25] Lord so what God is
[39:27] doing he's
[39:29] calling just like God called a nation
[39:32] out of a Nation you know people say what
[39:34] they want to say this message is
[39:37] real and my heart is in
[39:40] it and whether many falling here and
[39:43] there and departing from the
[39:46] faith and falling away that's Bible
[39:49] that's it's written that it will
[39:52] happen we search our hearts
[39:57] examine ourself make sure you know where
[39:59] you stand look to Christ the anointed
[40:04] word it's very it's very important you
[40:07] know a heart go out for those Lord have
[40:11] mercy but while while there's still time
[40:15] we got to examine
[40:16] ourself Prophet said he said you need a
[40:19] shaking now he said I need a shaken down
[40:22] he said together we'll make it by the
[40:24] grace of God Amen so we're looking at
[40:27] his
[40:28] grace oh God it's a serious
[40:31] hour it's a serious hour so the churches
[40:34] to call out assembly the church heard to
[40:44] shout but we must be baptized by the
[40:47] spirit amen by one Spirit we're all
[40:49] baptized in that body members in
[40:52] particular of the body of
[40:55] Christ
[40:57] that's where we must have the token
[41:00] that's why the prophet said the
[41:01] highlight of my entire
[41:06] Ministry should have follow those S he
[41:08] said that's the highlight of his entire
[41:11] Ministry is that token that's something
[41:14] that's that's the essence right there
[41:16] that's the he's saying that's the
[41:18] essence of why why I came it's for you
[41:22] to receive the
[41:25] token
[41:31] M wow when I see the blood I pass over
[41:35] you the death angel and he said the last
[41:38] plag to hit the church is spiritual
[41:40] death you know I I'd ask the church and
[41:42] I've asked a few other churches
[41:46] honestly I asked them a
[41:48] question if there was a scale from 1 to
[41:53] 10 for you to determine one one is near
[41:57] zero which is freezing cold and 10 means
[42:02] on fire for God whichever is harder
[42:05] white heart or red white heart is harder
[42:06] than red
[42:07] heart and you you on a scale you you
[42:11] don't have to say it but you as an
[42:13] individual where will you place yourself
[42:15] on that
[42:16] scale now if you say five then I'm going
[42:18] tell you that's lukewarm it and God is
[42:20] through you out of his
[42:22] mouth you see are you a 10 plus where
[42:26] you on the scale or you are one see
[42:29] where's your life where's your heart
[42:31] where's your Zeal where is it are you
[42:34] still on fire when you first come in but
[42:36] because of Trials because of tests
[42:38] because of
[42:39] baners you allow the devil to fame you
[42:42] and cool you off but where are you at
[42:45] see we must be on fire for God Amen we
[42:48] should we should blow up the scale amen

[42:55] fire for God we got to be on fire for
[42:58] God you know one thing about being on
[43:00] fire for
[43:01] God the devil is afraid of fire amen I
[43:05] said the devil is afraid of fire
[43:08] Hallelujah you know why he's afraid of
[43:11] fire because it reminds him of his
[43:14] [Music]

[43:30] going safe around that brother he's on
[43:32] fire see why it reminds him of his his

[44:23] Army uncapable of being defeated

[44:30] that's what the devil can't stand he
[44:32] hates that all hell is against that
[44:34] Revelation Christ in you the hope of
[44:36] glory all hell is against it when you

[47:22] now amen praise the Living God God Amen
[47:27] bless his wonderful name that's why the
[47:29] prophet cried out didn't recognize in
[47:30] your day in his message he said created
[47:32] me a Revival oh God make me to hunger to
[47:35] thirst to be do be more willing to do
[47:37] your will more humbler more consecrated
[47:42] servant he said that's what we need our
[47:45] prayer let he said let me be the Revival
[47:47] Revival in me the Revival in you see
[47:50] that's how it should
[47:52] be
[47:54] amen bless his wonderful name it's
[47:57] stimulation from the revelation of the
[47:59] word and I'm influenced by the star you
[48:03] know I I said now the prophet spoke
[48:05] influence so many times I want to I want
[48:08] to see what more what what it say and I
[48:11] never really looked up that word so in a
[48:14] a Webster it's called a Webster
[48:18] collegate dictionary encyclopedia anyway
[48:21] I looked up in there that word influence
[48:24] it stood out to me
[48:26] and I had to keep reading it I said my I
[48:28] can't believe this but that word
[48:31] influence there is defined
[48:34] as
[48:35] fluids
[48:38] released from the
[48:41] heavens from the Galaxy fluids
[48:45] released from the
[48:47] Galaxy to come upon humans to cause the
[48:52] different actions in their life I said M
[48:57] I said that that word is
[48:59] something and then I thought about we
[49:02] had a seven
[49:03] star that came and influen US aren't you
[49:07] GL in the spirit oh aren't you glad amen
[49:11] but you know we don't stay at the
[49:13] seventh
[49:14] star you know that because remember in
[49:17] the Holy place it was Seven Stars there
[49:20] were seven
[49:21] candlesticks but now in the most holy
[49:24] place
[49:26] is that day
[49:27] star Christ is called the day star he's
[49:30] called the pillar of fire so every age
[49:33] had a star influencing them spiritually
[49:38] speaking but it only came to that we may
[49:41] thought because the Bible said now that
[49:43] we have a sure word of Prophecy the day
[49:44] has gone and the day star has has risen
[49:47] in our hearts now now we learn in
[49:49] science or that the day star is called
[49:53] the sun actually
[49:56] but you know the prophet a message it is
[49:59] the rising of the
[50:02] sun see the prophet had his ministry was
[50:06] in stages said at evening time he came
[50:08] out at evening time they shall be light
[50:11] but and then later he began to preach at
[50:13] the Midnight Hour but then at the end of
[50:15] his ministry he preached on the rising
[50:17] of the Sun so it so his ministry changed
[50:20] from the eite message to the rising of
[50:23] the sun amen amen yeah the same word the
[50:26] same same word but it was stages from
[50:30] from evening time to midnight to rising
[50:32] of the Sun so by the time in 65 what is
[50:36] it it is the rising of the sun 64 what
[50:39] was it good morning arise shine Shalom
[50:43] to who the bride amen oh bless this
[50:47] wonderful name cuz now the Evening Sun
[50:50] cannot ripen the sea right so the
[50:53] ministry had to change so the Sun could
[50:55] rise to ripen the seed in our hearts by
[51:00] the Holy Ghost amen bless this wonderful
[51:03] name so I'm glad for almighty God oh
[51:07] bless his wonderful name it's the
[51:08] quickening power to the Sea it's the
[51:10] Dynamics in the
[51:12] mechanics Dynamics alone alone will not
[51:15] work it must be the Holy Ghost upon the
[51:19] word Jesus said the words that I speak
[51:22] unto you they are spirit and they are
[51:23] life you know I want to take out my
[51:26] my my phone so I can see the
[51:31] time they got my
[51:33] jacket that's why I brought my phone
[51:36] because I I noticed yesterday it wasn't
[51:37] a clock so I brought my phone and put it
[51:40] on silence so I can keep up with the
[51:43] time youall got me
[51:50] now I'm not Al I'm not
[51:53] Al you all have such a
[51:58] that's
[52:00] wonderful see sometime you think you
[52:02] have to go over seas for a
[52:06] pool we appreciate the pool honestly I
[52:10] don't say that for flatter it's the
[52:12] truth it's wonderful wonder that that
[52:16] means more as as Proverbs 17 says it's
[52:20] better a dve morer than a house full of
[52:23] strife in other words a little people
[52:27] than a a
[52:29] crowd strife and
[52:33] eny so thank God for your
[52:36] spirits it's a
[52:38] fire I've GR in churches where it's
[52:40] hundreds and
[52:42] 100 so
[52:45] quiet where Jesus
[52:48] is hallelujah amen amen now some worship
[52:54] God inside
[52:56] if they want to that's fine yeah now we
[52:58] know there was a time when the prophet
[53:00] had there when it was time for deserting
[53:02] now the sister coming out Hallelujah you
[53:05] know she missed her heill another one
[53:08] came up bubbly buba dancing he said that
[53:11] was the
[53:14] time but the one came up rly she re he
[53:19] but now when the word is coming forth
[53:22] that's difference there's a Hallelujah
[53:24] there's a glory amen when the seals were
[53:27] open amen the Hallelujah went up the
[53:30] glories went up JN to they hurt me
[53:33] heaven they hurt me in Earth they hurt
[53:36] me in other dimension amen worth is the
[53:39] Lamb to receive power and glory and
[53:43] wisdom amen because John recognized the
[53:47] lamb amen and only the lamb is worthy
[53:52] Michael couldn't even open his ears only
[53:54] the lamb
[53:56] the lamb tore off the seals I see the
[53:59] lamb took the book and tore off the
[54:01] seals and the lamb s it down to
[54:04] Revelation
[54:06] 10:7 amen Revelation 10:1 Michael is
[54:09] Christ came down in that form but the
[54:12] lamb is on the throne making
[54:14] intercessions for you and I so we have
[54:17] to watch the manifestation and the
[54:20] changes of his name because the word
[54:22] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[54:24] name of God am
[54:26] when he went to Abraham in Genesis 17 he
[54:28] went to him as aedi the strength Giver
[54:31] cuz he told him to be perfect and Jesus

[59:37] old boy walking around with the bottle
[59:39] can you imagine that no it's time for us
[59:41] to grow up it's later than we
[59:44] think misery love company and long as
[59:47] the devil would try to hold you in those
[59:50] room oh so and so did that but that was
[59:52] 10 years ago you you have the same story
[59:54] have you forgiven the brother for doing
[59:56] that to you have you forgiven the sister
[59:59] and they are living that all those years
[1:00:01] and bringing everybody they came with it
[1:00:04] and you know it's terrible when are you
[1:00:07] going to let it go and move on some
[1:00:11] someone done lied on you and you living
[1:00:13] way back there and you bound many are
[1:00:16] bound right in their mind in bondage
[1:00:19] because of what somebody said about them
[1:00:22] or said to
[1:00:23] them you I preached the same way back
[1:00:25] home it's the truth cuz people are bound
[1:00:28] like that and they they they have been
[1:00:30] wounded no doubt you give time for the
[1:00:32] wounds to heal but 10 years and 15 and
[1:00:36] 20 years no no something else wrong you
[1:00:40] want pity
[1:00:41] now you understand you know I had
[1:00:44] someone to tell me the Lord was doing
[1:00:47] different works and one guy come to me
[1:00:49] and said Brother David he said don't
[1:00:51] pray for me he said I'm on disability
[1:00:55] I'm receiving a disability check and if
[1:00:57] you pray for me I know that I'll be
[1:00:59] healed it'll cut my check off but see
[1:01:02] God could have given a better job you
[1:01:04] remember the one that was begging arms
[1:01:06] Peter and John said look on us s go Have
[1:01:09] I None but I give thee in the name of
[1:01:11] Jesus Christ rise up and Mar amen he
[1:01:14] went forth probably made more money with
[1:01:17] the job than he was on
[1:01:19] disability we don't want things handed
[1:01:21] on the silver stoon we won't appreciate
[1:01:23] it as much
[1:01:27] notice all right but all this Mysteries
[1:01:29] revealed only as he promised to his Bri
[1:01:36] prom what mystery Christ The Mystery of
[1:01:39] God reveal amen hell is against this
[1:01:43] truth of revelation of this mystery see
[1:01:45] hell is against
[1:01:47] it but the bride is standing on it
[1:01:51] amen that's her stand
[1:01:55] why do you hunger Hallelujah why do you
[1:01:59] thirst is the father trying to reveal
[1:02:02] this hidden secret to you you see why
[1:02:04] there's a hunger and thirst it's the
[1:02:06] father trying to reveal this hidden
[1:02:07] secret to you but you let so many things
[1:02:10] get get it out of you you let your job
[1:02:13] you let your wife you let your husband
[1:02:14] you you let your children you let the
[1:02:17] cares of the
[1:02:19] world you let some Pastor or some
[1:02:22] preacher you let somebody else get that
[1:02:24] out of you but when you know that way
[1:02:28] down in your heart you're thirsting and
[1:02:30] hungry it's gone trying to reveal it to
[1:02:34] you see the Revelation the last day is
[1:02:38] here do you see so that's why you hunger
[1:02:42] and you thirst because it's God trying
[1:02:44] to reveal and see God said I call you no
[1:02:46] Jesus said I call you no more
[1:02:49] servants because a servant knowth not
[1:02:51] what his Lord doth but I call you
[1:02:53] friends
[1:02:55] and a friend don't weigh thoughts true
[1:02:57] friends is both
[1:02:59] ways you don't weigh thoughts around one
[1:03:02] another you know have to say I wonder
[1:03:04] she I read a quote or she I call the
[1:03:07] prophet
[1:03:08] name I'm just
[1:03:15] saying but God the Bible say Abraham was
[1:03:18] called the friend of God why God say
[1:03:21] shall I from Abraham what I'm about to
[1:03:24] do
[1:03:25] so he
[1:03:26] reveal himself and his secrets to his
[1:03:30] friends so we are his
[1:03:32] friends he's not AF afraid to call his
[1:03:49] brother that's when God is dealing with
[1:03:51] you before anything can happen out here
[1:03:54] to make you be a Christian something has
[1:03:56] to happen in the heart to turn you to
[1:04:00] Christianity that's right it's election
[1:04:03] God does that that's how
[1:04:08] he so it's a blessing that we thirst and
[1:04:12] hunger after
[1:04:19] righteousness praise the Lord praise the
[1:04:22] Lord I'm I'm about to close is
[1:04:26] out but uh what do we see the Revival is
[1:04:30] the moving of the spirit it what it does
[1:04:33] it brings souls to
[1:04:35] Christ it brings us back to a spiritual
[1:04:39] condition one of the meanings of Revival
[1:04:42] it means to bring back to
[1:04:47] conscience you know the prophet said it
[1:04:49] like this he said we don't remember he
[1:04:52] said our minds were were black La it but
[1:04:56] God come in this end time to us to take
[1:04:58] away the spiritual Amnesia aren't you
[1:05:01] glad because people get spiritual
[1:05:03] Amnesia through through Battles Through
[1:05:06] Wars harm between two
[1:05:12] opinions
[1:05:15] tra but then you have to take a for meor
[1:05:20] places that's why the Lord on the road
[1:05:22] to em May you had to take them back to
[1:05:25] the places and then their eyes will open
[1:05:28] then they recognize so anytime the enemy
[1:05:30] try to get you into
[1:05:32] AIA
[1:05:34] State that's the best
[1:05:39] way
[1:05:42] amen right even if you have to as the
[1:05:44] psalmist said in Psalm 77 even if you
[1:05:46] have to call back a song of remembers
[1:05:49] the devil show bring you those songs
[1:05:51] when you in the world those who in the
[1:05:53] world he'll take you way back and and
[1:05:57] and sing that song to you and he could
[1:05:59] sing he'll sing it right in your
[1:06:01] ear and try to take it how much more a
[1:06:04] song that brought you if you don't have
[1:06:07] nothing else to tell tell how you was
[1:06:09] lit amen you know I remember when we
[1:06:12] come in singing a song I'm so glad that
[1:06:14] the Lord brought me
[1:06:16] out and how did you feel when you come
[1:06:19] come out to witness I'm running for my
[1:06:21] life and then you have to ask the
[1:06:24] question like Paul said you run well but
[1:06:26] now what has hindered you you know thank
[1:06:29] God he sent a prophet thank God for this
[1:06:31] message hold on on fire for this message
[1:06:34] and you see them today they they don't
[1:06:36] want anything to do with this message
[1:06:39] it's
[1:06:40] sad what about the songs you s
[1:06:42] Hallelujah I'm glad he brought me
[1:06:45] out we still glad he brought us out cuz
[1:06:49] we still here we hadn't found anything
[1:06:52] better amen because because it's the
[1:06:54] stimulation from the revelation of the
[1:06:57] word of God amen hallelujah oh bless his
[1:07:01] wonderful name I love this wine this the
[1:07:04] best wine

[1:07:43] stuff and besides that my father was an
[1:07:46] alcoholic he passed away
[1:07:49] 2008 the alcohol destroyed his heart ate
[1:07:54] up his
[1:07:55] heart but I was able to win him to the
[1:07:59] Lord before

[1:08:07] in my home it destroyed my home my
[1:08:11] family with my father I always loved him

[1:10:37] wild Oliver we didn't even seek after
[1:10:39] God as the as Hosea said I was found in
[1:10:42] them that sought me not a people that
[1:10:44] didn't even seek after me they shall be
[1:10:47] called the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:10:49] that's the grace of God he said remember
[1:10:51] Israel was blinded in part why for you
[1:10:54] and
[1:10:56] I Joseph said you know have to
[1:11:00] we it happened deserve life I'm

[1:11:20] when the fourth seal was open amen I
[1:11:25] have some the prophet said you went
[1:11:27] beyond the curtain he said there were
[1:11:30] Millions that's few out of six point
[1:11:33] something billion right Millions is true
[1:11:36] but he said I see I see you over there
[1:11:39] praise the Lord I seen you over there I
[1:11:43] was one of them that said we arrested on
[1:11:45] Us
[1:11:47] heyen Praise the Lord he said this
[1:11:49] message for my congregation only now his
[1:11:51] congregation is all those that follow
[1:11:53] this
[1:11:54] message so we're serving a living Christ
[1:11:57] we have the devil's answer now we're not
[1:11:59] just saying that we're not just beating
[1:12:02] at the air we have the devil's answer he
[1:12:05] said well what's his question he's
[1:12:07] saying where's Christ you can tell a
[1:12:09] devil Christ is in me amen praise the
[1:12:13] Living God Amen it's time we we've taken
[1:12:16] too much off of
[1:12:17] Satan we have authority and power we can
[1:12:20] serve notice on the enemy amen it's the
[1:12:24] truth so influence or fluids released
[1:12:28] from the Stars it says fluids released
[1:12:31] from the stars that come upon humans to
[1:12:35] cause different actions in their life
[1:12:37] even in the moon when there's a full
[1:12:39] moon they say more crime is done doing a
[1:12:42] full moon a full moon you know these
[1:12:44] these things how there's no coincidence
[1:12:48] the Bible said when he created the uh
[1:12:50] when the Lord created the the son he
[1:12:53] created for in the moon and the stars it
[1:12:55] was for signs and for seasons and for
[1:12:58] days and for for years and for
[1:13:01] months so these things and and here he
[1:13:04] say he tell Psalm 147 say he tell us the
[1:13:07] number of the Stars he calleth them by
[1:13:10] where were you and the sons of God
[1:13:11] shouted together the sons of God
[1:13:14] shout uh shouted for Jo amen Satan
[1:13:18] wanted to wanted to wor be worshiped and
[1:13:22] be above the St God of God Jesus in MA
[1:13:26] numbers 24:17 even balam prophesied of a
[1:13:30] true Prophecy of the Lord Jesus the star
[1:13:32] shall rise out of
[1:13:34] Jacob he's the chief star amen he's the
[1:13:38] day star he's the chief
[1:13:40] star what happened when the Lord Jesus
[1:13:43] was born what
[1:13:44] happened three stars lined up to
[1:13:47] represent him why God declares himself
[1:13:50] in the heavens on Earth what happened
[1:13:54] 1963 cloud
[1:13:57] of so he declar himself in the heavens
[1:14:00] and it has an influence it has a major
[1:14:03] effect on the earth and upon his people
[1:14:08] put that those stars of the Moon the
[1:14:10] changes of the moon what
[1:14:12] happened representative the ages so God
[1:14:16] is real God is real so here in
[1:14:21] closing we see that
[1:14:26] redemption in two parts out
[1:14:30] of the law Us in ja the law told us we
[1:14:36] were in see the law told us that we were
[1:14:39] wrong but Grace said I was
[1:14:42] wrong Grace come to call us to
[1:14:45] repentance to say I was wrong and Grace
[1:14:48] say I forgive you amen I'm glad for
[1:14:51] Grace I'm glad glad for Grace we have a
[1:14:54] message of Grace that say I forgive you
[1:14:58] that say that you The sinless Virtuous
[1:15:01] wife of the Son of God to say you mis's

[1:15:09] free Amen to give you Jubilee cuz where
[1:15:13] the spirit of the Lord is there's
[1:15:15] liberty so we have a message of Grace
[1:15:18] amen amen Grace has come to
[1:15:21] us I'm so glad
[1:15:24] you know I say a lot of times you hear
[1:15:27] uh youth meetings and you hear the young
[1:15:30] people just being hammered you're this
[1:15:32] you're that you're that telling them all
[1:15:33] their own but they already know
[1:15:37] that but Grace comeing tell you how to
[1:15:40] get out of it see not just tell you
[1:15:43] you're in it they know they in it but we
[1:15:45] must tell them how to get out of it they
[1:15:47] said what must we do to be
[1:15:50] saved and Peter told them what they must
[1:15:52] do to be sa saved he didn't tell them
[1:15:54] what they need to stop doing to be saved
[1:15:57] he told them what they need to do to be
[1:15:59] saved when you tell them what they need
[1:16:01] to do to be saved then they'll stop
[1:16:04] doing what they doing not to be saved
[1:16:07] you understand when the Lord Jesus came
[1:16:10] in Jerusalem many of them asked who is
[1:16:13] this they should have been saying here
[1:16:15] he is amen so when you see the vision
[1:16:19] you'll say here he is is Christ the
[1:16:22] anointed one
[1:16:24] it's all that the prophet spoke of is
[1:16:27] happening it's right Among Us so here it
[1:16:30] is here's the vision and the vision is
[1:16:33] made
[1:16:34] plain amen so we must walk in the vision
[1:16:37] and just like their Vision the vision
[1:16:39] had an effect on Isaiah the vision had
[1:16:42] an effect on Daniel this Vision has an
[1:16:46] effect on us so we must make haste and
[1:16:50] make our call in election sure because
[1:16:52] without a Vision the people perish so I
[1:16:55] thank God for the vision aren't you glad
[1:16:57] for the vision I'm glad for this Vision
[1:17:01] bless is one of Fame there's a deep call
[1:17:03] to the
[1:17:05] Deep I'm glad that by his grace he calls
[1:17:08] me to
[1:17:10] respond it's only by his grace only by
[1:17:14] Grace we can enter and by the blood of
[1:17:17] Jesus Christ we can enter Because the
[1:17:19] enemy once you're washed in the blood
[1:17:22] and once you're sealed in Satan is
[1:17:26] sealed
[1:17:28] out amen so we appreciate God's Amazing
[1:17:32] Grace for opening our eyes he said
[1:17:34] blessed are your eyes for you see and
[1:17:36] your ears for you hear for even many
[1:17:40] prophets sought diligently concerning
[1:17:43] the grace of God and even Angel's desire
[1:17:46] to look upon the things that we see God
[1:17:49] chose us for this last age because this
[1:17:53] is the greatest age for the people of
[1:17:55] God the prophet said no other age he
[1:17:58] wanted to be in but this age if God
[1:18:01] would have showed him all down through
[1:18:02] time he said he would have chose this
[1:18:04] age still because this is the greatest
[1:18:06] age God chose the you to be in this
[1:18:09] greatest
