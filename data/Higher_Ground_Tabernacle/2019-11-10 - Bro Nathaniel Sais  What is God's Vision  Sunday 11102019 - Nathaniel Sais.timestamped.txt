[29:50] one more time to gather in his name and
[29:56] we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for
[29:59] His grace God is good to us we ought to
[30:05] always try even if we're not happy to be
[30:11] happy because God has been good to us
[30:17] battles will always come don't expect
[30:21] them not to come you're in the age where
[30:25] they shall come you we claim to be the
[30:29] bride and the bride has been called to
[30:32] be tested and it's ride every test
[30:36] according to the Word of God is not
[30:38] pleasant
[30:40] but in all that we are tested and God
[30:43] expects us to overcome so we thank God
[30:47] for His grace yesterday we had a
[30:50] wonderful youth meeting I'm sorry but
[30:53] those who didn't make it or those who
[30:54] wasn't aware of it we try to make it

[31:06] wonderful message we have been blessed

[33:03] [Music]
[33:47] [Music]
[34:09] [Music]
[34:46] [Music]
[34:53] [Music]
[35:30] [Music]
[35:43] [Music]
[35:59] [Music]
[36:11] [Music]
[36:24] [Music]
[36:36] [Music]
[36:56] [Music]
[37:04] [Music]
[37:11] well you did come up a few notches
[37:14] [Music]
[37:17] we don't have our brother come down get
[37:20] some real money
[37:22] I really need that you will come and
[37:24] speak to us I like a great heart and
[37:29] self that's the way I don't like
[37:32] lukewarm service I like a green hot
[37:36] that's right
[37:38] [Music]
[37:46] you mean
[37:49] you know one of the ways we would catch
[37:53] a little bit of wind when we get some
[37:54] altitude you know when God gives us him
[37:58] for inspiration you know what we do we
[38:01] start hunting down the devil where's the
[38:04] devil at because only that Devils gonna
[38:07] start getting upset he's gonna start
[38:09] fighting you and some aspect of your
[38:11] life something maybe that happens some
[38:12] spirit that might be here when the
[38:15] spirit begins to lift us up we want to
[38:17] just start discerning where that those
[38:19] spirits are at our brother Keith already
[38:21] prayed here a little bit ago to bind
[38:23] every spirit I appreciated that prayer
[38:25] you know those prayers are not in vain
[38:28] this isn't just flowery words it's not
[38:30] saying something nice things are done
[38:34] for purpose win it and when a child of
[38:36] God when a son or daughter of God prays
[38:39] a prayer of faith things begin to move
[38:43] things begin to change that's why we're
[38:47] here today that the words that have been
[38:50] spoken not just here today but the words
[38:53] that God has spoken would be seen here
[38:56] today in our lives but also as we go
[38:58] from here today we want to go from here
[39:01] with something that will give us power
[39:03] to overcome tomorrow and what about the
[39:07] next day and the next day and what about
[39:09] when God calls for us that trumpet
[39:11] sounds in and he says all of my children
[39:14] who prepare themselves who will be ready
[39:18] for that moment today is the day to get
[39:21] ready today is the day to hunt down
[39:24] where the devil is trying to hide and
[39:25] say devil today is the day of
[39:27] deliverance because God has brought his
[39:30] word to me and I don't have to be
[39:32] subject to you amen praise the Lord
[39:37] thank you musicians appreciate the the
[39:42] sacrifice of them playing this morning
[39:46] let's turn in your Bibles if you have
[39:48] your Bibles with you let's turn to
[39:52] proverbs 29
[39:59] praise the Lord we've been by God's
[40:08] grace we've been speaking in the last
[40:10] couple days and just kind of laying a
[40:14] foundation as continuing on the work
[40:17] that brother brother Brooks has been
[40:18] doing
[40:23] you see power from God comes by knowing
[40:30] God's Word because God does not bless
[40:34] those things that are not of his word
[40:36] now you can get into what what you may
[40:40] be familiar with this term maybe or not
[40:42] and that's okay if you're not but there
[40:44] is God's perfect will and there is God's
[40:46] permissive will now when you're when
[40:49] you're you tell your child son or
[40:51] daughter do this and they do it 90
[40:55] percent they do it 75 percent they do
[40:58] sort of do what you've told them to do
[41:00] you say well okay next time let's do
[41:05] this it'll happen sometimes and God
[41:07] gives us instructions we kind of want to
[41:09] do we want to do what God told us but we
[41:11] want to do with our flavor we want to do
[41:14] it in the way that we want to do it and
[41:15] God says well bless that as much as it
[41:17] is my word but there's a part in there
[41:19] that I can't bless and there's tons when
[41:22] we go through life and we we hit a wall
[41:24] and we hit a wall I got this I'm praying
[41:29] and I believe I have faith and I don't
[41:31] feel like things are moving but when
[41:34] it's God's Word
[41:35] things must move so what is what is the
[41:39] challenge to us we have to dig in and
[41:42] see Lord if you speak it must be and if
[41:47] it is not what I believe it should be
[41:50] something's wrong
[41:51] is there some sin over here this is some
[41:55] sin over here do i misunderstand the
[41:58] Word of God because I might be standing
[42:00] on something Lord said stand over here
[42:03] and I'm standing over here and God said
[42:07] until you get over there
[42:08] I can't bless you so we want to
[42:12] by God's grace we're going to look at a
[42:13] little subject we're gonna take a text
[42:15] here in Proverbs and we're gonna look at
[42:17] a little subject today what is God's
[42:18] vision
[42:19] what is God's vision because we apply
[42:23] our own vision to what God has told us I
[42:25] want to do what I want to do go ahead I
[42:28] pray that you bless what I want to do
[42:29] and God doesn't want what you want dad
[42:32] wants you to know his desire and lift
[42:35] his desire and if you live his desire
[42:38] how can God not stand with you and then
[42:43] the demons in Hell when you wake up in
[42:45] the morning and put your foot down
[42:49] father awake again every devil in hell
[42:54] brothers had an exaggeration that is not
[42:57] an exaggeration
[42:59] two hundred thousand thousand demons can
[43:01] be at your door no thank you
[43:04] today is a day of salvation and God gave
[43:07] me strength to overcome every demon what
[43:10] brother I'm just a little nobody you are
[43:12] but Jesus Christ is somebody and if
[43:15] Jesus Christ is in you he is there
[43:17] somebody he is their power he is the
[43:20] only name that all power was given to
[43:22] you the devil thought he had power and
[43:26] God came and took the power that Satan
[43:28] thought he had so when Satan tells you
[43:32] as power you can say no you don't
[43:36] brother do I have to yell the way you're
[43:38] yelling right now no you don't you can
[43:42] have a quiet humble prayer Lord Jesus
[43:45] you gave me your word and I want to
[43:48] stand on your word Lord you have the
[43:52] victory
[43:53] it's your word it's your victory it's
[43:56] your vision I want to live your vision
[43:58] and watch what God will do in situations
[44:01] like that now let us read here so I can
[44:04] have you be seated here in a moment
[44:07] proverbs 29 proverbs 29 verse 17 to 21
[44:17] we'll just read these few verses and
[44:20] then it will have you be seated
[44:24] verse number 17 correct thy son and he
[44:26] shall give the rest yea he shall give
[44:29] delight unto thy soul where there is no
[44:32] vision the people perish but he that
[44:35] keepeth the law happy is he a servant
[44:39] will not be corrected by words for
[44:42] though he understood understand he will
[44:44] not answer see us yes also verse number
[44:50] 20 and 21 see us now a man that is hasty
[44:53] in his words there is more hope of a
[44:56] fool than of him now let's read this
[45:01] carefully he that delicately bringeth up
[45:05] his servant from a child shall have him
[45:09] become his son at length may God bless
[45:14] the reading of the word you may be
[45:16] seated when I read this this morning I
[45:20] was for this this scripture came to mind
[45:23] where there is no vision the people
[45:24] perish and I was reading it fits so
[45:27] perfectly these verses that we just read
[45:28] fit so perfectly with what the Lord had
[45:31] laid upon my heart and I love as it says
[45:35] here the one that will delicately raise
[45:40] their children delicately so many times
[45:45] we can be heavy-handed with our children
[45:47] but it says here that if one will raise
[45:50] a servant correctly that they will raise
[45:53] up and they will become a son why
[45:55] because they've been treated as a son
[45:58] they've been taught as a son so let's
[46:01] just unfold this we were talking
[46:03] yesterday about unfolding so let's
[46:05] unfold this little scripture here just a
[46:08] little bit
[46:09] they had servants in the Old Testament
[46:12] but here we are a New Testament what
[46:14] does it have to do with us so let's
[46:16] apply this to the scripture and the New
[46:19] Testament and apply it to us the servant
[46:22] is one that is under law we are born in
[46:27] this world by law by God's law of
[46:31] natural reproduction here we are born in
[46:33] this world and we are under law
[46:37] of sin and death because we are in sin
[46:40] we will die but if we are raised
[46:43] correctly if God's Word comes to us and
[46:45] we accept that word though the Bible
[46:47] tells us that at length that means there
[46:50] might be a little season but as the word
[46:53] has come it begins to do something in
[46:56] that soul and the one that is under law
[46:59] becomes a son a son is not by law a son
[47:05] is by grace a son is like the father and
[47:09] as we are growing up in the Lord there
[47:13] are times when we feel like well it's
[47:14] just a bunch of rules how can I possibly
[47:17] do everything that God told me to do but
[47:21] if we can look at the word then the
[47:22] right way and apply it to us those that
[47:25] are servants are I just have there's
[47:27] just rules and and everything that God
[47:29] says just a bunch of rules and it's laws
[47:31] and laws you're thinking as a servant
[47:34] God doesn't want you to be a servant God
[47:38] wants you to be a son or daughter of the
[47:41] Living God and it even says I believe it
[47:44] was Paul said in the New Testament he
[47:46] said you are no longer a servant you are
[47:48] more than a servant you are a son you
[47:51] are all a daughter if you accepted Jesus
[47:53] Christ as your Savior and accepted the
[47:55] work that God wants to do in your life
[47:57] you are no longer a servant
[48:00] we're not held by the law were held by
[48:03] grace Paul said I am a prisoner of
[48:05] Christ why he was a prisoner by love not
[48:08] because a god was forcing him but
[48:11] because something in his heart was
[48:12] holding him was binding him in a good
[48:15] way in a positive way something that was
[48:18] holding him well I don't know if I can
[48:20] be a Christian tomorrow don't worry
[48:22] about it friend that which is in you if
[48:24] God gives you his Holy Ghost it's the
[48:26] Holy Ghost that will keep you you can't
[48:28] keep yourself but don t keep do because
[48:31] if do his word and you fall that makes
[48:36] God a liar did you catch that
[48:40] if God's Word is in you and you fall it
[48:44] makes God a liar and God cannot lie
[48:49] mmm-hmm praise the Lord where there is
[48:54] no vision the people perish and the sub
[48:57] that we're going to take from these
[48:58] scriptures here our little text this
[49:00] morning and maybe by God's graces to be
[49:01] encouraging to you
[49:02] what is God's vision because we don't
[49:06] want our vision anymore
[49:07] we've already tried our anybody tried
[49:10] their whole vision and saw how it didn't
[49:11] work and you raise your hands and say
[49:13] that I've tried my vision I failed I
[49:17] failed on so many things in life of this
[49:19] and big things and small things because
[49:21] I had my ideas and and friends let me
[49:24] tell you you might say to me today
[49:25] brother brother but I'm sincere I was
[49:28] sincere - I was sincerely wrong brother
[49:33] Branham said many people accused him of
[49:34] being wrong but they even his testimony
[49:37] was known he wasn't dishonest people
[49:40] just believed that he thought wrong
[49:42] and that's true whenever every son and
[49:44] daughter of God if the world around you
[49:46] isn't looking at you like you're a
[49:48] little bit different something's wrong
[49:51] Ruth left everything that she had and
[49:53] she left it all and went and followed
[49:55] the army she was a little different and
[49:58] bad calls you out of where you're at to
[50:01] serve Him to follow him to be a little
[50:03] different but when you take a step on
[50:07] God's Word and you stand there in faith
[50:10] remember it's God's Word that key is
[50:13] bound to and if you were lost in his
[50:16] word he can't forsake you and he's not a
[50:21] liar therefore you cannot have anything
[50:24] but victory praise the Lord
[50:30] now remember without a vision the people
[50:32] perish let's go to Matthew 2/6 chapter
[50:46] everyone doing all right this morning
[50:48] praise the Lord praise the Lord here in
[50:59] Matthew 6 chapter but I just love the
[51:05] grace of God he is so good to us let me
[51:09] I mean friends if you feel if you feel
[51:13] down remember it's not the feeling that
[51:18] is your evidence the evidence is God's
[51:21] Word and God's Word never fails why is
[51:24] that important brother well I like to
[51:26] feel good I like to feel good too don't
[51:29] we don't like to feel who likes to feel
[51:31] bad nobody likes to feel bad but when
[51:34] you do when you do feel bad is God's
[51:40] Word still true hey man so if we're in
[51:43] the middle of a trial we're down in the
[51:45] valley you know what there's something
[51:46] so strange about a child of God because
[51:48] they can walk in the valley and people
[51:50] are looking at them like you should be
[51:52] down there's something your life is just
[51:55] falling apart how is it that you you
[51:57] have a joy that you still have a smile
[51:59] on your face because my God said he he
[52:02] has delivered not that he will deliver
[52:03] he has already delivered so I can walk
[52:08] through the valley of the shadow of
[52:10] death and the devil says but I'm gonna
[52:12] put death on you I'm gonna put this on
[52:14] you I'm gonna put financial ruin on you
[52:16] I'm gonna put this I'm gonna put
[52:17] character I'm gonna put ulcers I'm gonna
[52:20] put all kinds of things on you and you
[52:21] can say I'm already delivered but
[52:25] brother you don't feel it it's not based
[52:27] on feeling it's based on God's Word and
[52:31] if we can just have a vision of that of
[52:33] God's Word death hell and the grave
[52:36] doesn't have a chance let alone some
[52:38] Devils that come to you and try to try
[52:40] to convince you well you're not a son or
[52:42] daughter of God mm-hmm God told me how
[52:49] do you know that God loves you we have a
[52:52] precious little sermon called a deep
[52:55] call of to the deep
[52:57] how do you know that God loves you do
[53:00] you want God do you want more of God
[53:04] that is the evidence of God's love my
[53:09] brother I don't feel like he loves me do
[53:11] you want God yes Amen brother I want God
[53:13] do you desire more of God yes but I
[53:15] desire more of God that is the evidence
[53:18] because remember the ocean was made and
[53:21] then the fish was made to swim in the
[53:23] ocean first there was the ocean first
[53:27] there was a God then there was a
[53:28] creation it was made to love and desire
[53:30] that God my so many good things there
[53:36] but let's move on Matthew 6 Matthew 6
[53:43] let's read verse 21 to 23 Matthew 6 21
[53:49] to 23 for where your treasure is there
[53:55] will your heart be also
[54:00] the light of the body is the eye if
[54:04] therefore thine eye be single thy whole
[54:08] body shall be full of light verse number
[54:13] 23 but if thy eye be evil the whole body
[54:18] is full of darkness if therefore the
[54:22] light that is in thee be darkness how
[54:25] great is that darkness if your eye be
[54:31] single maybe you get a picture in your
[54:34] head when I first read that scripture of
[54:36] you know they call it a cyclops of this
[54:38] creature has got one eye in the middle
[54:40] that's not what that means what that
[54:43] means is if your eyes are fixed on one
[54:46] thing and if that thing is the right
[54:50] thing then the light will fill the whole
[54:54] body not just this body but the whole
[54:58] body if there is no vision the people
[55:02] perish if there is the eye is not fixed
[55:04] on the right thing the body is full of
[55:08] darkness but if we have our
[55:11] fixed on the right thing the Bible tells
[55:14] us that a whole body will be full of
[55:16] light so if we can make sure today as we
[55:20] are here today we've got a little bit of
[55:21] time together well brother you might
[55:23] preach for a long time you know
[55:24] yesterday I was so grateful to the
[55:26] children they were very patient with me
[55:28] we weren't much longer than I would like
[55:30] to preach to little children but there
[55:33] were some things important I believe
[55:34] that well my heart it was important to
[55:35] come out and I believe that came out as
[55:37] God intended I was feeling overwhelmed
[55:39] at the end of yesterday I was feeling
[55:40] overwhelmed God your word is so big how
[55:43] could I ever express it all you know
[55:47] that God's Word can't all be expressed
[55:49] from behind this pulpit did you know
[55:51] that because the only way that God's
[55:54] Word can be expressed is if you live
[55:59] their life the word the Living Word of
[56:04] God who is Jesus Christ what we want to
[56:11] wear brother I want to watch somehow you
[56:14] know there is and forgive me for hitting
[56:16] this in this way but it's the truth you
[56:18] know friends people came out of
[56:20] denominational churches and say praise
[56:22] God there's one God and we got the word
[56:26] and we got Jesus Christ that's
[56:29] denominational thinking we got the word
[56:32] over here we got Jesus Christ over here
[56:34] they're the same thing God's Word is
[56:37] himself and that's what he's trying to
[56:39] express today if you can have the vision
[56:41] of God that is Jesus that is Jehovah
[56:44] Savior The Anointed One that's who God
[56:47] is so the name of the word is Jesus
[56:50] Christ that's who he is that word has
[56:54] come to you and we were demonstrating
[56:56] yesterday a message in a piece of paper
[56:59] and as the people piece of paper was
[57:01] given unto us through the Prophet now we
[57:03] have the paper and it's supposed to
[57:05] unfold in our lives here we are for
[57:09] those of you that know there's a
[57:11] three-fold purpose of God and we took
[57:13] that as a very simple example it was a
[57:15] piece of paper that was folded three
[57:16] times and you unfolded and you see this
[57:19] God above you unfold it again and you
[57:21] see that God came down to BRE
[57:24] demson to us to be our Savior but you
[57:26] were folded again and he says now I want
[57:30] to be one with you I want you to be me I
[57:33] want to be you you be me to shall be one
[57:36] flesh
[57:37] think about that friend - shall be one
[57:40] flesh why the very God of heaven wants
[57:43] to dwell in you and express himself in
[57:45] you praise the Lord we saw on Friday we
[57:50] saw that God made Adam in His image and
[57:53] he gave Adam responsibility
[57:55] oh my but friends until Adam at Concord
[58:00] desert the serpent he was now fully in
[58:03] the image of God because of something
[58:05] had been in heaven Lucifer had been in
[58:06] heaven and what happened in heaven what
[58:10] happened in heaven God said Lucifer
[58:13] that's enough get up he conquer Lucifer
[58:17] and when Adam was made leader over the
[58:20] earth where was the serpent in the earth
[58:25] here is now Adam is made ruler over the
[58:28] serpent but God knew that to be in his
[58:33] perfect image Adam and the race of Adam
[58:38] had to overcome the serpent why are we
[58:43] here today why are we all sitting in
[58:47] this room right now because God has
[58:50] drawn us something has tugged at our
[58:53] hearts the evidence of God's love and we
[58:56] sit here today because God is still
[58:59] unfolding his plan because man is not in
[59:02] the image of God until we the bride of
[59:05] Jesus Christ have conquered the devil in
[59:07] every way in every facet and every piece
[59:10] that can be conquer in your life in your
[59:15] everyday life God wants to conquer the
[59:17] devil in your life if you give you a lot
[59:23] to God what will happen the exact same
[59:26] thing that happened in heaven well I got
[59:29] this devil I got this devil give your
[59:31] life to God and watch what God will do
[59:33] he will cast out the devil of your life
[59:37] and in it God is being expressed because
[59:42] God is the conqueror of Satan that's who
[59:45] God is
[59:46] the Savior to hold the Savior came down
[59:50] but he didn't just come down he wanted
[59:53] to be in I will be with you even in you
[59:57] today is the day of salvation today is
[1:00:01] the day that God is made praise the Lord
[1:00:05] but what does it look like friend what
[1:00:08] is victory when God begins to move in
[1:00:12] our lives what is it what what does
[1:00:15] victory look like the world has many
[1:00:18] misconceptions about what victory looks
[1:00:19] like the world has chased after riches
[1:00:23] the Catholic Church chased after wealth
[1:00:26] and power gold overlaid they got
[1:00:32] together and they talked about it and
[1:00:33] they agreed and they said this is what
[1:00:38] victory looks like but you know when God
[1:00:46] sent a man in this day I'll be talking
[1:00:49] with brother Isaiah about this how this
[1:00:51] got out of proportion how many people
[1:00:54] have looked at the prophet and made the
[1:00:55] prophet God he was part of deliverance
[1:00:57] but he was not the deliveries you are
[1:01:00] part of deliverance but you are not the
[1:01:02] deliverance you are God's people and
[1:01:05] God's people are deliverance it's good
[1:01:08] in you and that's how he wants to
[1:01:11] conquer the devil the first he fell but
[1:01:14] the second will not praise the Lord what
[1:01:18] a promise to us that second he will not
[1:01:20] fall praise the Lord right down to the
[1:01:25] last death hell and the grave is going
[1:01:27] to be holding on oh I think we can still
[1:01:29] hold it I think we can still hold a
[1:01:31] victory but that bride just keeps
[1:01:33] slipping away slipping away and the
[1:01:35] devil comes back and he's holding on to
[1:01:37] you he's on your pant leg get off of me
[1:01:41] devil get off of me because God gave him
[1:01:46] a victory death trying to hold on maybe
[1:01:48] you're sick today that's trying to hold
[1:01:50] on to you
[1:01:51] but Jesus already took the keys of death
[1:01:54] hell and the grave what is the vision
[1:02:01] complete and utter victory complete in
[1:02:07] every part every part
[1:02:10] praise the Lord Jesus it's this is why
[1:02:16] yesterday I felt so overwhelmed the
[1:02:19] message is so good the message is so
[1:02:21] pure it's so today it's so alive right
[1:02:24] now the message is alive praise the Lord
[1:02:27] you forgive me I gotta take my coat off
[1:02:31] praise the Lord thank you brother
[1:02:37] complete and utter victory now you
[1:02:41] remember you are not the victory God is
[1:02:46] the victory in you it's Jesus Christ in
[1:02:51] you that is the victory it is not to
[1:02:55] lose or lift yourself up it is now for
[1:02:57] me to lift myself up but what happens
[1:03:00] when we get things in order God begins
[1:03:03] to speak to you he begins to minister to
[1:03:05] your heart and he says do you know who
[1:03:07] you are let me express myself to you
[1:03:10] because if you know who I am then you
[1:03:13] know who you are because you are part of
[1:03:16] me when God looked at the body of Jesus
[1:03:18] he saw male and female the body the body
[1:03:23] brother yes sir we were represented
[1:03:25] there
[1:03:25] and if we identify with his death we can
[1:03:28] identify with the resurrection that same
[1:03:31] resurrection that was in the first
[1:03:33] church age the second the third they
[1:03:35] received the love of the truth then it
[1:03:37] had the full revelation of God's truth
[1:03:39] but they have the love of the truth they
[1:03:42] loved it unto death they were they died
[1:03:45] they were martyred they were killed for
[1:03:46] it
[1:03:47] and here today God knew it was going to
[1:03:50] be the darkest of the darkest ages and
[1:03:53] he said in a darkest stage I'm gonna
[1:03:55] send the greatest light
[1:03:57] and that light is to be in you it is
[1:04:00] supposed to be God in you overcoming the
[1:04:03] devil praise the Lord my God is good
[1:04:12] here in Matthew 6 Matthew 6 we read for
[1:04:20] where your treasure is there your heart
[1:04:21] will be also the light of the body is
[1:04:23] the eye if therefore thine eye be single
[1:04:27] if that vision is right the whole body
[1:04:29] will be full of light
[1:04:32] you know the Bible also says the next
[1:04:35] verse that we read earlier it says that
[1:04:38] if your vision is wrong then it's full
[1:04:40] of darkness but let's just focus on God
[1:04:43] gave us a vision right we can spend our
[1:04:47] time understanding the wrong vision well
[1:04:50] I don't want to be that you can spend a
[1:04:52] lifetime doing that and never understand
[1:04:54] what the real vision is you can spend
[1:04:57] all your time studying well not studying
[1:05:00] I want to if you're the way I say that
[1:05:03] studying sometimes relates to a preacher
[1:05:05] we we use the word studying really we
[1:05:07] just want to spend time with God and get
[1:05:09] God's word so we can stand here and
[1:05:10] preach the pure Word of God but then
[1:05:12] what I'm trying to express is it's true
[1:05:15] for everybody if you spend your time
[1:05:18] what I don't want to do that and I don't
[1:05:20] want to do this and I don't want to do
[1:05:22] that and I don't want to do this what
[1:05:23] you're saying is I don't want to
[1:05:25] transgress the law but didn't we read
[1:05:29] that the servant can become a son and if
[1:05:33] a servant becomes a son the law is of no
[1:05:36] more effect and if we can understand
[1:05:39] what is right then we can walk by the
[1:05:41] grace of the Living God and power from
[1:05:44] God Himself will be in us and that power
[1:05:47] will overcome it is now us overcoming it
[1:05:50] is God overcoming do us
[1:05:52] that's his desire God could just say
[1:05:56] it's done but God wants those words to
[1:06:02] come from your lips brother how can I
[1:06:06] ever be there how could it ever be so in
[1:06:09] tune with God the answer is in your own
[1:06:12] efforts that you cannot just like you
[1:06:15] cannot save yourself Jesus Christ is the
[1:06:18] only one that can save you and it's the
[1:06:20] power of God who is Jesus Christ in you
[1:06:24] that will set everything right so what
[1:06:28] is the challenge that we submit
[1:06:30] ourselves unto God and allow him to do
[1:06:34] the world if we can just humble
[1:06:39] ourselves if we can be more sincere all
[1:06:41] god I'm so tired of messing up Lord you
[1:06:45] know that repentance is not saying I'm
[1:06:47] sorry did you know that many people
[1:06:51] think that well you know I can live like
[1:06:53] the devil but if I come and repent on
[1:06:54] Sunday that I'm okay
[1:06:56] that's a hypocrite that's not a son or
[1:06:59] daughter of God
[1:07:00] a son or daughter of God wants to know
[1:07:02] instruction the Bible says we read that
[1:07:05] in Proverbs that a son that will accept
[1:07:06] instruction is a good thing but a son
[1:07:09] that won't accept or a servant that
[1:07:10] won't accept instruction it's just it's
[1:07:13] destruction but if we will accept the
[1:07:20] Word of God so many people to come to
[1:07:22] church
[1:07:22] Oh Lord forgive me I did this this week
[1:07:24] they got their lists just like during a
[1:07:26] Catholic Church well I did this this
[1:07:28] week and I did this this week and I did
[1:07:29] this this week you know if you're a son
[1:07:31] of God you still repair do you know that
[1:07:34] you still want that but Paul said I
[1:07:37] strive daily I exercise myself daily
[1:07:40] that there is nothing between God and I
[1:07:43] but you're not coming just to say Lord
[1:07:45] I'm sorry a broken in the contrite heart
[1:07:49] is good but it doesn't mean you're gonna
[1:07:51] fall away it doesn't mean that God's
[1:07:52] gonna cast you away and if you've been
[1:07:54] struggling with that that will open a
[1:07:56] door for a demon of depression to come
[1:07:59] into your life but you remember that
[1:08:02] it's not your effort it is the complete
[1:08:04] work of Jesus Christ that delivered you
[1:08:07] and it's not a feeling it's a done work
[1:08:12] and if our vision is right then we
[1:08:14] understand that God did that work but if
[1:08:17] we have something in our life that is
[1:08:18] not a baaad
[1:08:20] well Lord just changed my life give me
[1:08:24] instruction and I will take it
[1:08:29] repentance is not saying I'm sorry
[1:08:32] repentance is if you're going this way
[1:08:35] and you repent it means I'm gonna stop
[1:08:38] turn around and go the other way it's
[1:08:42] not saying I'm sorry I've broken in the
[1:08:45] contract heart is a good thing in the
[1:08:47] right place if it's genuine eyes
[1:08:49] genuinely sin before God God I don't
[1:08:51] want sin in my life Lord forgive me but
[1:08:54] also give me strength that I don't do it
[1:08:56] again
[1:08:57] our overcoming power which we love the
[1:09:02] blood of Jesus Christ but the story
[1:09:04] didn't end there he died and went to
[1:09:07] hell he got victory he rose again and
[1:09:10] gave the victory to the Saints it's
[1:09:13] their victory that we want today is that
[1:09:15] victory that we want to be in us the
[1:09:18] power from on high praise the Lord you
[1:09:22] know that Jesus Jesus told the disciples
[1:09:25] go tarry in Jerusalem until you be
[1:09:27] endued with power from on high you know

[1:09:39] new birth in my life the evidence that
[1:09:42] God wants to give it to you is that
[1:09:43] desire and if you had the desire then
[1:09:48] dwell in peace and wait until you be
[1:09:50] endued with power from on high if it
[1:09:54] worked in the book of Acts
[1:09:55] it will work today dwell in the city of
[1:09:59] peace praise the Lord
[1:10:02] Abraham meant the king of that city and
[1:10:07] you know Abraham spent the rest of his
[1:10:09] life looking for that city where is that
[1:10:13] sea I met the king Abraham it doesn't
[1:10:16] exist yes it does I met him and if
[1:10:19] there's a king of the city and he was
[1:10:21] real I had communion with him I talked
[1:10:24] with him if he's real I've got to find
[1:10:28] him

[1:11:16] this is now Paul he's explaining to the
[1:11:20] Jews just for a moment this book of
[1:11:24] Hebrews sometimes it's good it's always
[1:11:26] good and we understand the context see
[1:11:28] sometimes you can read a book in a Bible
[1:11:30] and you don't understand it and
[1:11:31] sometimes it's because we don't
[1:11:32] understand where it fits this is Paul
[1:11:36] explaining to the Jews the connection
[1:11:38] the book of Hebrews is Paul explaining
[1:11:40] to the Jews the connection the bridge
[1:11:42] from the Old Testament he's proving to
[1:11:44] them by scripture that the Jehovah of
[1:11:46] the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the
[1:11:49] new that's what the book of Hebrews is
[1:11:51] now as he begins to explain here hebrews
[1:11:56] 11:32 and 40 he's just been talking
[1:12:00] about the Old Testament Old Testament

[1:12:46] better resurrection and others had
[1:12:49] trials of cruel mocking and scourge
[1:12:51] scourging 's yerry moreover with bonds

[1:13:06] for the same gospel that you walk today
[1:13:09] well brother they were in the old test
[1:13:12] but they received the love of the truth
[1:13:13] there wasn't there
[1:13:15] their responsibility on the day that
[1:13:17] they were living in they accepted the
[1:13:19] Christ that delivers for their day and
[1:13:22] when they did they were abused they were
[1:13:25] killed they were torn in half for it
[1:13:28] those are your brothers and sisters
[1:13:33] verse number 36 and others had trial of
[1:13:35] cruel mocking and scourging yea moreover
[1:13:37] a bonds and imprisonment they were
[1:13:40] stoned they were sawn asunder were
[1:13:43] tempted were slain with the sword they
[1:13:45] wandered around as sheepskins and
[1:13:46] goatskins being destitute afflicted
[1:13:49] tormented of whom the world was not
[1:13:52] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[1:13:53] mountains and dens and caves of the
[1:13:55] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:14:00] good report through faith received not
[1:14:03] the promise received not the promise
[1:14:08] brother
[1:14:09] let's read carefully receive not the
[1:14:13] promise verse number 40 God having
[1:14:17] provided some better thing for us that
[1:14:20] they without us should not be made
[1:14:24] perfect but I thought it was just about
[1:14:29] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[1:14:33] me me me that is the human condition
[1:14:35] it's all about me me me me me me me
[1:14:40] but God withheld the promise from them
[1:14:45] because of you
[1:14:49] they were tormented they were sawn
[1:14:51] asunder they were torn apart and God
[1:14:55] said the time to receive the promise is
[1:14:57] not yet because your brothers and
[1:14:59] sisters still to come and as we sit here
[1:15:02] today we read the Bible
[1:15:04] yes brother we've read those verses
[1:15:05] again friends I'm not trying to rebuke
[1:15:07] you I'm trying to bring your attention
[1:15:08] to the fact that this is so real it's so
[1:15:12] if we can catch a vision of what this
[1:15:14] means it begins to mean something to us
[1:15:17] there are those that died they went
[1:15:20] through suffering they went through pain
[1:15:22] and they did not receive the promise
[1:15:25] because of you because God had a vision
[1:15:35] God had a vision and the vision wasn't
[1:15:39] complete because you were born you
[1:15:45] weren't there so they were withheld from
[1:15:49] the promise but they accepted the
[1:15:51] promise seeing it afar off they only had
[1:15:56] a little piece you remember I can't see
[1:16:00] it right here you see a shadow you can
[1:16:03] you see that shadow that's a vague
[1:16:05] shadow that's what they had in the Old
[1:16:08] Testament but they saw the shadow and
[1:16:11] they accepted it how much more when the
[1:16:15] shadow has become the hand when God has
[1:16:17] come to dwell in flesh how much more we
[1:16:20] look at it sometimes we say oh my that's
[1:16:23] nice the shadow has become the living
[1:16:30] body of God and they just had a shadow
[1:16:33] they accepted it and died and gave their
[1:16:36] lives for how much more should we have
[1:16:39] the conviction that burns in us Oh God
[1:16:42] it's worth giving up my life God may not
[1:16:46] be asking you to be torn apart in the
[1:16:48] physical God may not be to be asking you
[1:16:51] to have the sufferings in your flesh but
[1:16:55] all of those things that the Old
[1:16:57] Testament Saints had that is asking you
[1:17:00] to overcome them in the spirit
[1:17:04] they had it in the natural and all of
[1:17:08] the natural takes the spiritual so here
[1:17:11] we are today and God is trying to rip
[1:17:13] your homes apart that's the devil's
[1:17:15] trying to rip you apart he's trying to
[1:17:17] rip the church apart he's trying to rip
[1:17:19] the Assemblies apart he's trying to rip
[1:17:21] the body apart trying to be ripped
[1:17:24] asunder the devil wants to pull this way
[1:17:26] the devil wants to pull this way what
[1:17:30] will we do
[1:17:32] will we stand like them will we stand
[1:17:37] like them there comes the Lions for
[1:17:40] punishment
[1:17:41] all these these Christians and in the
[1:17:45] first couple of church ages you don't
[1:17:47] know that church history Roman the the
[1:17:50] political Roman Empire had a stronghold
[1:17:52] on Jerusalem had a stronghold on Judea
[1:17:55] and they had a political rule and they
[1:17:58] could kill anybody they wanted and when
[1:18:00] they hated the Jews they really hated
[1:18:02] the Jews and they would just feed them
[1:18:04] to the Lions for entertainment they
[1:18:07] didn't go to the movies they want to see
[1:18:09] a Christian get eaten by lion
[1:18:12] you know I'm gonna say it this way you
[1:18:16] know a child of God going to the movies
[1:18:18] is just like that because that old devil
[1:18:21] the lion is running around seeing who
[1:18:24] can he can devour and it would run right
[1:18:26] into his mouth
[1:18:27] yes devour me well that might be a
[1:18:31] little bit harsh but it's still the
[1:18:32] truth you are what you feed on and if
[1:18:36] your feeder what the devil has what are
[1:18:38] you going to be we were talking about on
[1:18:41] Friday a sheep when they eat they don't
[1:18:45] do this I'll have any wool yet I gotta
[1:18:49] push some more I need some wool I'm
[1:18:52] straining I'm struggling to push out
[1:18:53] some wool they just eat and if you eat
[1:18:59] what the devil feeds you what do you
[1:19:00] produce what to devil fed you well
[1:19:04] brother I don't really know how I don't
[1:19:06] have victory in my life and the devil's
[1:19:08] done this and the devil's done that
[1:19:10] where's the devil
[1:19:13] there's a stink over here I can't put my
[1:19:15] finger on it my god you know what it is
[1:19:17] God you reveal it because if I don't
[1:19:20] have victory it's because something's
[1:19:21] wrong you're not a liar
[1:19:23] God is not a liar his word is absolute
[1:19:27] and if I don't have victory I need to
[1:19:29] sniff it out some stinks over here what
[1:19:35] is this oh I got this CD I thought this
[1:19:38] CD was okay something doesn't feel right
[1:19:41] you don't need somebody to sit down with
[1:19:44] you and explain what's wrong
[1:19:45] the Bible says that the Spirit of God
[1:19:46] will lead you in all truth in
[1:19:48] righteousness but you know so-and-so
[1:19:52] does it so-and-so has this and so and so
[1:19:56] does that God didn't call you to fall so
[1:19:58] Apollo soul and soul God called you to
[1:20:01] follow the spirit of the Living God and
[1:20:03] if you follow his spirit that spirit
[1:20:06] wolf will lead you in your life you know
[1:20:10] I've done this thing my whole life and I
[1:20:12] didn't think it was offense to God but
[1:20:15] something's just pricking me in my heart
[1:20:16] I challenge you
[1:20:17] saints of God go home and if you can
[1:20:20] find something like that get rid of it I
[1:20:22] know a man that got rid of his TV on the
[1:20:25] next week his heart his daughter gave
[1:20:27] her heart to the Lord
[1:20:28] is that worth it that's worth it
[1:20:32] why because you're giving up give up
[1:20:35] what the devil has and God did that man
[1:20:38] now has three daughters that are serving
[1:20:39] the Lord because he gave something up
[1:20:45] you know a brother I can't even explain
[1:20:48] it just didn't brother I'm not a
[1:20:49] preacher I can't I'm not good with words
[1:20:51] God didn't say you had to be good with
[1:20:53] words
[1:20:54] he just said follow his spirit he didn't
[1:20:57] say you had to explain it just follow
[1:20:58] his spirit and God will do all those
[1:21:01] things I say that because sometimes as
[1:21:03] we preach and I know I move quickly and
[1:21:05] it's because time is short sometimes we
[1:21:08] try to cover some ground or trying to
[1:21:09] move quickly damn brother you're just
[1:21:11] talking so fast I just can't catch all
[1:21:12] of it
[1:21:13] that's okay because I pray that by the
[1:21:16] grace of God the words that are being
[1:21:17] spoken today are more than words Jesus
[1:21:20] said my words are spirit and if the
[1:21:23] Spirit of Truth has come that he will
[1:21:26] he will lead you I can't lead you but
[1:21:29] their books can't lead you it's got to
[1:21:31] be the Spirit of God as we said on
[1:21:33] Friday
[1:21:33] brother Brooks and Albert says a
[1:21:35] fellowship in Alejo we just appreciate
[1:21:36] this thought you aren't are you are a
[1:21:38] brother books is people this isn't
[1:21:41] brother Brooks at church this is God's
[1:21:43] church this is God's pulpit this is
[1:21:46] God's Word and you are God's treasure
[1:21:51] God treasures you know brother you're
[1:21:55] preaching so hard and I you know I got
[1:21:57] this wrong and I got this wrong do you
[1:21:58] we just read in Psalms that if a good
[1:22:02] son or good daughter will take the
[1:22:04] correction and apply and if you apply it
[1:22:06] friends there is deliverance to be had
[1:22:10] brother I come on Sunday and I've
[1:22:13] repented of that did you or did you say
[1:22:16] you were sorry Paul brother I came for
[1:22:19] prayer and brother Brooks laid his hands
[1:22:21] on me
[1:22:22] and praise God God forgave me he did it
[1:22:24] because God is a merciful God but did
[1:22:28] you change direction did you go home and
[1:22:31] do the thing did you go home and follow
[1:22:35] the instruction well brother I didn't
[1:22:38] feel spiritually led to do that now we
[1:22:41] got things mixed up we think that the
[1:22:44] the leading of the Spirit is a feeling
[1:22:46] it's not a feeling when God preaches he
[1:22:51] sends a man of God to preach the gospel
[1:22:52] you hear the word Amen that's the truth
[1:22:56] make a note I need to go home and do
[1:22:58] such-and-such brother but I don't feel
[1:23:01] that God isn't asking you to feel it
[1:23:04] he's asking you to follow his word
[1:23:08] that's all if you want to be a victory
[1:23:12] just follow the word this is complete
[1:23:16] victory to the believer absolute
[1:23:20] complete entire for I can't emphasize
[1:23:23] that to you enough this will smash the
[1:23:27] devil to bits in your life what is God's
[1:23:34] vision God's vision is deliverance
[1:23:38] his people to conquer you know when
[1:23:42] Esther came before the king she kept the
[1:23:44] first time she was fasting and she was
[1:23:46] praying oh you know I might die if I die
[1:23:49] I die the first time she came before the
[1:23:53] king before the king the Bible says the
[1:23:55] fear of God is the beginning of wisdom
[1:23:56] the beginning of wisdom you are aware
[1:23:59] that God is above all a man but that
[1:24:03] wasn't the last of the unfolding Esther
[1:24:06] came again and this time she was a
[1:24:08] little more bold because she had the
[1:24:10] last experience now it wasn't just
[1:24:13] because the the King said you know
[1:24:17] Esther whatever you want you want half
[1:24:21] the kingdom I'll give it to you now she
[1:24:23] had remembered my brother pray to begin
[1:24:26] brother the Spirit of God was blessing
[1:24:28] me in the back when you were praying
[1:24:29] that dot well you know brother Keith was
[1:24:33] it shouting it's not about shouting we
[1:24:36] might shout we might talk quietly it's
[1:24:39] about the truth the spirit of truth when
[1:24:43] the spirit of truth it but brother I
[1:24:45] don't feel it I feel down if you're a
[1:24:50] child of God I don't feel sorry for you
[1:24:52] well brothers because your life is so
[1:24:54] easy well if you want to trade some time
[1:24:58] let me know because no child of God has
[1:25:01] it easy as brother Brooks was saying no
[1:25:04] child of God has it easy why because God
[1:25:08] wants you in his image how can you be in
[1:25:12] his image unless you conquer the devil
[1:25:14] how can you conquer the devil unless the
[1:25:16] devil comes against you I appreciated
[1:25:20] that and our brother said that he was
[1:25:23] talking about the heat is I don't
[1:25:25] believe he said it directly I just was
[1:25:26] talking about the statute of perfect man
[1:25:27] he's praying about the statute of a
[1:25:28] perfect man add to your faith add to
[1:25:31] your faith knowledge or I'm sorry I had
[1:25:34] your faith virtue add to your virtue of
[1:25:35] knowledge and this knowledge brother
[1:25:37] Branham explains what this knowledge is
[1:25:39] this knowledge is gnat because I read
[1:25:41] every every line of the Bible and I
[1:25:43] memorized at all that's not what this
[1:25:44] knowledge is and it's not because I have
[1:25:47] this I could quote all the clothes of
[1:25:49] brother brand have said that's also not
[1:25:50] what the knowledge is
[1:25:52] knowledge is that you have seen the
[1:25:53] water the gods word had to your your
[1:25:56] faith virtue add to your virtue
[1:25:57] knowledge you have faith praise God you
[1:26:00] have faith but not your faith need to be
[1:26:02] strengthened you need to grow in
[1:26:03] strength and as you grow in strength now
[1:26:05] you get knowledge well how do you get
[1:26:07] knowledge because your faith begins to
[1:26:08] work
[1:26:10] faith is the unseen when your faith is
[1:26:13] made manifest it's no longer faith it's
[1:26:17] knowledge I'm not I'm not thinking of
[1:26:22] what's going to happen I'm now you know
[1:26:24] faith is a vision did you know that
[1:26:26] faith is a vision of what hasn't been
[1:26:28] manifested yet but faith already knows
[1:26:31] it and when faith is strengthened it
[1:26:34] becomes virtue and with virtue as
[1:26:36] manifested it becomes knowledge and
[1:26:39] Esther was growing in knowledge because
[1:26:43] she came before the king and then she
[1:26:45] came before the king she was trembling
[1:26:47] what if what if he doesn't want me she
[1:26:51] didn't know who she was she came in
[1:26:55] before the king and the king is can you
[1:26:57] imagine the Kings been busy that day he
[1:27:00] has to make rulings and he has to lead
[1:27:02] the kingdom and he's he's I say it like
[1:27:09] this
[1:27:09] the first thing that the King says or
[1:27:12] they what the King answers he lets his
[1:27:14] heart go right away I'll give you half
[1:27:16] of the kingdom you see that
[1:27:19] I'll give you how I want you to rule
[1:27:21] with me that's God's intent from the
[1:27:26] beginning that will be with God to
[1:27:29] minister to God God ministers up
[1:27:30] minister to God by you submitting your
[1:27:32] life to God you were ministering to you
[1:27:34] that's a wonderful thought we're gonna
[1:27:36] leave it like that for right now but
[1:27:37] that's a wonderful thought so here is
[1:27:39] Esther she's come before the king and
[1:27:41] and the first time she comes she's
[1:27:43] trembling the next time she comes in she
[1:27:44] says King would you come home and I
[1:27:46] prepared a banquet for you would you
[1:27:48] come in and have basically have dinner
[1:27:51] have a banquet she invites the king home
[1:27:54] with her hey man God is not just for
[1:27:59] church on Sunday Esther invited the King
[1:28:04] so then she comes the next time she's a
[1:28:06] little bolder cuz now she has knowledge
[1:28:08] you know the King does really love me
[1:28:11] Esther wasn't with the King every day
[1:28:14] did you know that she didn't get to see
[1:28:16] the King every day that's why she was
[1:28:18] afraid she had not been called the Bible
[1:28:22] I believe the Bible even says I haven't
[1:28:23] been called since and she lists at the
[1:28:25] time that it's been said she's been
[1:28:26] called but who and she comes before the
[1:28:29] King the second time she's a little bit
[1:28:30] more and you know the third time she
[1:28:32] comes now she just she doesn't just walk
[1:28:35] in flippantly but she walks in more
[1:28:37] confidently she walks in more Here I am
[1:28:41] again and the King asked her and the
[1:28:44] King never gets tired of seeing her
[1:28:46] Esther
[1:28:48] oh my queen I just don't get tired of
[1:28:53] seeing you're so beautiful
[1:28:54] now that that doesn't really register
[1:28:56] for us as men as much but you know that
[1:28:58] God is speaking to you to what God is
[1:29:01] saying is that you are getting fit for
[1:29:03] your purpose as you are growing in
[1:29:05] confidence and learning in the Lord and
[1:29:07] growing up this is kind of the terms
[1:29:08] that we men more associate with we are
[1:29:10] being fit for our purpose
[1:29:12] we're useful in the eyes of God hey man

[1:29:19] more with yes that God says I'm
[1:29:22] beautiful yes thatís resonates with our

[1:29:28] wouldn't say beautiful may be handsome
[1:29:31] may be rugged may be strong you know but
[1:29:33] beautiful what God is saying is that he
[1:29:38] is pleased with Esther and God is
[1:29:41] pleased with you if you follow his
[1:29:44] vision so Esther now comes in and she
[1:29:49] comes in you know what she's had this

[1:31:38] revelation that only comes from the
[1:31:40] father there's a secret communication
[1:31:43] going on and here Haman says huh what
[1:31:50] what did I do

[1:32:15] you won't bow before the devil it makes
[1:32:17] him really angry when you won't do what
[1:32:20] the devil was it makes him upset he
[1:32:22] doesn't like it don't be afraid of him
[1:32:26] don't be scared of the devil that dare
[1:32:29] will you know how they say this about
[1:32:30] they even like bears and and things in
[1:32:33] the wilderness I don't want to try this
[1:32:34] out but this is what they say they say
[1:32:36] that the Bears are more afraid of you
[1:32:37] than you are of them I don't know if
[1:32:40] that's true or not but I do know that
[1:32:42] the devil is more afraid of you than you
[1:32:45] are of him but you know sometimes I get
[1:32:48] so afraid he's more afraid than you have
[1:32:51] ever been let me I just gotta give you
[1:32:55] one more example of that here's Peter
[1:32:57] walking after the day of Pentecost he
[1:32:59] comes to a man he's at the gate and here
[1:33:04] comes Peter this man is laying on the
[1:33:06] ground he says the man says you know do
[1:33:09] you have some money can I have some
[1:33:10] money and and Peter says Flett a silver
[1:33:15] and gold have I none I don't have any
[1:33:17] money but I do have something and that
[1:33:20] which I have I'll give unto you can you
[1:33:22] imagine the devil can you imagine Haman
[1:33:24] sitting there P Peter what do you get a
[1:33:28] do you have that kind of power
[1:33:31] Jesus had that power but what how did it
[1:33:39] how'd that man get up and walk Peter you
[1:33:43] don't have that I thought you didn't had
[1:33:47] that power how is it that this man that
[1:33:51] was lame he's now walking Peter I didn't
[1:33:55] know you had that power Esther I didn't
[1:33:57] know you had that power children of the
[1:34:00] Living God
[1:34:00] the devil doesn't know the power of God
[1:34:03] that dwells in you and he all he knows
[1:34:07] is every time he's met a child of God
[1:34:10] he's lost every time well you know but
[1:34:15] brother some people you know they died
[1:34:17] in there sleeping in the ground yep but
[1:34:20] the devil didn't win he might think he
[1:34:23] might even have the idea that he won but
[1:34:25] he could he can read the Bible even
[1:34:27] though he doesn't know what its gonna
[1:34:28] look like
[1:34:29] he doesn't know how it's gonna happen
[1:34:30] but he knows that the Bible says that
[1:34:31] those that are dead in Christ shall rise
[1:34:33] again you don't have to be afraid of the
[1:34:38] devil
[1:34:40] here's their look at that Peter the dead
[1:34:43] would you imagine a devil look at that
[1:34:44] Peter what in the what is this
[1:34:50] can you imagine Haman looking at
[1:34:52] Mordecai I'm sorry
[1:34:54] looking at Esther what what what what do
[1:34:59] you mean your people here ham has been
[1:35:02] trying to do all this work behind the
[1:35:04] scenes trying to hide it from the king
[1:35:06] he doesn't know what he's walking into a
[1:35:08] trap
[1:35:09] what does the King do for Esther
[1:35:14] he says Esther what do you need this
[1:35:21] Haman Haman go hang him on his own
[1:35:25] gallows Esther what else do you need
[1:35:32] that Esther tell me what you need well
[1:35:37] King I need this I need this okay okay
[1:35:41] but you know what Esther this is just my
[1:35:45] real representation of that Esther
[1:35:48] here's a check you go sign it I've
[1:35:53] already so excuse me I've already signed
[1:35:54] it but it's blank you say what you want
[1:35:58] to happen and I will stand with you what
[1:36:04] do you want to happen the King already
[1:36:07] signed the check here he's giving you a
[1:36:10] blank check you know brother brother
[1:36:11] banner said the Pentecostals have money
[1:36:13] in the bank but they don't know how to
[1:36:14] write the check and then the legalists
[1:36:16] on the other side they know how to write
[1:36:17] the check they don't have any money in
[1:36:18] the bank God's children he wants him to
[1:36:21] have it all he wants it to be like
[1:36:26] Esther Esther here's a blank check
[1:36:28] whatever you need
[1:36:30] King what I want is deliverance for my
[1:36:33] people
[1:36:33] it's yours you speak it you want
[1:36:37] deliverance in your home you want
[1:36:40] deliverance in the phasic maybe you've
[1:36:42] struggled with for years God's giving
[1:36:44] you a blank check if we'll learn how to
[1:36:47] write the check we can draw on the money
[1:36:51] in the bank
[1:36:53] brother I don't know how to have money
[1:36:54] in the bank is this simple god I can't
[1:36:58] do anything well how is there having
[1:37:04] money in the bank because when you
[1:37:06] realize that you can't do anything it
[1:37:09] makes you look to the one that can and
[1:37:11] you realize that you're drawing on the
[1:37:13] Kings bank account the one that created
[1:37:17] all things if you need something else
[1:37:20] God can create it brother I don't know
[1:37:24] if God would do that for you God will do
[1:37:26] that for you if you ask you have not
[1:37:29] because you asked you just ask God pull
[1:37:32] on the Lord fill out the check praise
[1:37:36] the Lord I did not expect to go that
[1:37:39] direction today but let's continue on
[1:37:47] when you have God well this is what
[1:37:50] we're talking about today God's vision
[1:37:51] all of this is related to that when God
[1:37:56] is in his right place I've heard that
[1:37:58] Jesus Christ is God like we're talking
[1:38:00] about the beginning of service the word
[1:38:01] is Jesus Christ that's who he is the
[1:38:03] Lord Jesus Christ that's who the word is
[1:38:05] we're told when we talk about the word
[1:38:07] we're talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:38:08] Christ that's who he is
[1:38:09] so when we start to have God in order
[1:38:13] when we start to have God in order in
[1:38:16] the assembly the local assembly this is
[1:38:19] for us here today
[1:38:20] amen friends we're all here shoulder to
[1:38:22] shoulder not one about the other we're
[1:38:24] all here shoulder to shoulder to pull
[1:38:26] together so as we're here striving
[1:38:30] struggling to press forward a little bit
[1:38:32] more in Jesus Christ if we can
[1:38:35] understand how Jesus Christ fits into
[1:38:39] the church if he is placed correctly in
[1:38:44] the church he will then place you
[1:38:47] correctly in the church and when your
[1:38:52] place correctly in the church he will
[1:38:55] place you correctly in your home he will
[1:38:58] place you correctly in your marriage he
[1:39:01] will place you correctly in your job not
[1:39:05] all that
[1:39:06] it just starts with Jesus Christ being
[1:39:09] in the right place if you're in Jesus is
[1:39:13] in the right place because if you know
[1:39:15] where he's supposed to be at you know
[1:39:17] who he is Lord I can't do anything he
[1:39:19] says that's right but I can and I will
[1:39:23] do it through you so lay down yup so now
[1:39:26] he's in the right place now Lord now
[1:39:28] let's continue with our thought here
[1:39:30] Hebrews 11 I think we turn to Hebrews 11
[1:39:33] and we did not read yet so let's read
[1:39:34] Hebrews 11 and 32 we're trying to move a
[1:39:38] little quick more quickly here we did
[1:39:39] read here in he was 11 they without us
[1:39:43] are not complete is what we were talking
[1:39:45] about the Saints from the Old Testament
[1:39:46] now let's let's turn to first
[1:39:48] Thessalonians everyone doing okay today
[1:39:57] praise the Lord
[1:40:06] if anybody's tired that's okay I
[1:40:09] understand that just shake it off a
[1:40:11] little bit we want to keep pressing on
[1:40:14] and make sure we get what God has for us
[1:40:16] we all get tired sometimes and sometimes
[1:40:19] the spirit of sleepiness comes on us and
[1:40:21] you know our body we're trying to fight
[1:40:22] our bodies but God quickened Sampson you
[1:40:25] know that Sampson wasn't a big man you
[1:40:26] know that and he picked up the gates of
[1:40:29] the enemy and walked right up in the
[1:40:31] hill if God can do that he'd give us
[1:40:33] strength to get to a church service
[1:40:34] don't you think
[1:40:35] amen we don't have to wait till we get
[1:40:38] home to start filling out think of the
[1:40:39] check let's fill it out deposit Lord I
[1:40:43] need to draw on that account right now
[1:40:44] I'll need a little bit of strength God
[1:40:46] give me strength ought to do it wait
[1:40:48] wind uh I brother plated beginning a
[1:40:51] service I was there and strength what's
[1:40:52] coming to me in the back I'm not trying
[1:40:53] to be super spiritual I'm just telling
[1:40:55] you the truth that's what happened went
[1:40:57] up when the saints of God pray things
[1:40:59] take place would you begin to draw on
[1:41:01] the account God says yeah you're not
[1:41:03] going to overdraw he's not going to
[1:41:07] bounce his account it's unlimited if we
[1:41:11] could just understand that the power of
[1:41:14] God is unlimited there is no limit to
[1:41:18] the power of God and God wants that
[1:41:20] power to be in your heart
[1:41:25] 1st Thessalonians chapter 4
[1:41:36] first Thessalonians 4 we're gonna I'm
[1:41:42] gonna try to very quickly here just read
[1:41:44] verses 1 through 7 first that's it
[1:41:47] daesil onehans for 1 to 7 furthermore
[1:41:50] then we beseech you brethren exhort you
[1:41:52] by the lord jesus that you have received
[1:41:54] of us how you ought to walk in to please
[1:41:56] God so you would abound more and more so
[1:42:00] what does it take to abound you have
[1:42:04] received from us how you ought to walk
[1:42:08] so that you might abound that means
[1:42:12] increase and if you're not walking right
[1:42:15] you won't abound it's that simple verse
[1:42:21] number 2 for you know that what
[1:42:23] Commandments we gave you by the Lord
[1:42:24] Jesus for this is the will goes right to
[1:42:28] the will of God for this is the will of
[1:42:30] God even your sanctification that you
[1:42:33] abstain from fornication that every one
[1:42:36] of you should know how to possess his
[1:42:38] vessel in sanctification and honor but
[1:42:41] that's whose vessel let's bring this
[1:42:44] down real simple husbands and wives can
[1:42:48] you possess as a husband can I possess
[1:42:51] the the vessel of my wife no she's my
[1:42:57] wife
[1:42:57] it's very personal I love my wife very
[1:43:00] very much very dearly I want to be able
[1:43:03] to do everything I can for my wife but I
[1:43:05] cannot possess the vessel of my wife the
[1:43:09] Bible says possess your vessel well what
[1:43:13] happens when you possess your vessel
[1:43:17] Amen think about that one for a second
[1:43:20] if you possess your vessel and you be a
[1:43:24] child of God what happens to the
[1:43:27] environment around you the environment
[1:43:32] around you begins to change if you
[1:43:37] possess you want to affect somebody else
[1:43:39] you want to do good for somebody else
[1:43:42] you want to encourage somebody else you
[1:43:43] want to strengthen somebody else you
[1:43:44] possess your vessel you consecrate
[1:43:47] yourself you
[1:43:48] yourself in order don't say well you
[1:43:50] know so-and-so you know brother
[1:43:51] Nathaniel's preaching and that's for
[1:43:52] so-and-so you know so uh so needs to
[1:43:55] dedicate their life really what about
[1:43:59] your life because if you dedicate your
[1:44:01] life you watch the people around you
[1:44:04] begin to strengthen begin to increase in
[1:44:07] God if you possess your vessel not your
[1:44:12] neighbors
[1:44:13] yours verse number five
[1:44:16] not unless of concupiscence that's
[1:44:18] desires of the world even as the
[1:44:20] Gentiles which know not gone that no man
[1:44:22] go beyond and defraud his brother in any
[1:44:24] manner he just said possess your vessel
[1:44:26] and he says if you go beyond that you
[1:44:27] defraud your brother hmm the fraud means
[1:44:31] you stole how can you steal from your
[1:44:35] brother or your sister how can you steal
[1:44:36] from them just by not possessing your
[1:44:39] vessel we'll see because that the Lord
[1:44:41] is the Avenger of all such that's not a
[1:44:43] good thing to be in that place as we
[1:44:46] have forewarned you and testified for
[1:44:48] God hath not called us an unclean
[1:44:50] cleanliness but in the holiness let's
[1:44:53] roll right along to verse number 15 now
[1:44:57] this is now looking back to what we were
[1:45:00] reading in Hebrews remember in Hebrews
[1:45:02] we're talking about the Old Testament
[1:45:04] Saints this is now referring right back
[1:45:05] to that verse number 15 for this we say
[1:45:08] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:45:10] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:45:12] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:45:13] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:45:16] himself shall descend from the heaven
[1:45:17] with a shout that's number one number
[1:45:19] two with the voice of the Archangel
[1:45:21] number three with the Trump of God and
[1:45:23] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[1:45:25] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:45:28] caught up together with them in the
[1:45:30] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:45:31] so shall we for we ever be with the Lord
[1:45:36] let's back up to verse number 15 let's
[1:45:39] read verse number 15 again for this we
[1:45:41] say unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:45:43] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:45:46] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:45:48] them which are asleep which sleep hmm
[1:45:56] you
[1:45:57] prevent them but you without them or not
[1:46:00] them without you or not complete we are
[1:46:03] called up together to meet him in the
[1:46:04] air something's got to happen we can't
[1:46:08] prevent them we cannot be ready prevent
[1:46:11] them the Word of God says that we cannot
[1:46:14] prevent them but they without us are not
[1:46:17] complete the body it witness is saying
[1:46:21] here the body must be complete as a body
[1:46:24] not as random individuals enter just do
[1:46:28] whatever they want as a body we must be
[1:46:31] complete how can we be complete how can
[1:46:35] I encourage one another how can i
[1:46:36] strengthen my brother how can i
[1:46:38] strengthen my home lord I just don't
[1:46:41] know what to do I don't know how I could
[1:46:43] just make a difference you know I try so
[1:46:45] hard but I can't make a difference you
[1:46:48] know maybe this God doesn't love me do
[1:46:51] you want more of God that's the evidence
[1:46:54] of God's love you want to make a
[1:46:56] difference possess your vessel
[1:47:00] repentance is not saying I'm sorry it's
[1:47:04] about changing direction it's about
[1:47:07] taking God's Word and applying it to
[1:47:09] your life possess your vessel and if you
[1:47:13] possess your vessel what's the things
[1:47:16] around you change brother I just I don't

[1:47:22] right I don't know if I you know I don't
[1:47:25] know if I could friends what I'm telling
[1:47:27] you is God's vision let me maybe just to
[1:47:32] encourage I'll share a testimony with
[1:47:34] you when my son was about I think I
[1:47:40] touched on this last time I was here but
[1:47:41] it was some years ago and but this was a
[1:47:44] very deep difficult thing for my wife
[1:47:47] and I we go through we go through our
[1:47:50] trials together but she's a child of God
[1:47:53] she's a daughter of God and I'm a by
[1:47:56] God's grace a son of God and we we
[1:47:59] shoulder to shoulder we face the
[1:48:00] challenges that the Lord allows us to go
[1:48:02] through
[1:48:07] when my son was about two and a half
[1:48:08] months three and a half months old he's
[1:48:11] now by God's grace he is now five years
[1:48:14] old but when he was about that age he
[1:48:17] got pneumonia
[1:48:19] he got RSV which is a I believe is a
[1:48:21] viral pneumonia and he also got
[1:48:22] bacterial pneumonia as well infections
[1:48:24] in his lungs and it is fatal in in a
[1:48:28] percentage of children it's very
[1:48:29] dangerous it can be fatal under three
[1:48:32] months so I think it was he was
[1:48:33] two-and-a-half months old if I remember
[1:48:35] the numbers correctly so he was in a
[1:48:37] hospital and he went out on a Friday he
[1:48:41] ended up being there for two weeks
[1:48:43] and in those two weeks we almost lost
[1:48:45] him three different times let me tell
[1:48:48] you friends I had this the only way I
[1:48:49] know how to express it it will change
[1:48:50] your life if I know any of you have had
[1:48:53] serious situations life-threatening
[1:48:55] situations when the doctor comes in and
[1:48:58] the alarms are going off and everything
[1:49:01] is beeping and everything is you know
[1:49:03] there's a team of ten people run in and
[1:49:05] they're all on high alert and they're
[1:49:07] very serious the alarms are going off
[1:49:10] and your son has tubes going down the
[1:49:12] throat he's only two and a half months
[1:49:13] old
[1:49:14] can't breathe on his own he's been
[1:49:15] breathing like this for a week for a
[1:49:19] week he was at at something like a
[1:49:22] hundred and sixty or a hundred 70
[1:49:23] respirations a minute something like
[1:49:25] that he's intubated they have air oxygen
[1:49:31] going in his lungs and fluid keeps
[1:49:33] building up and he's choking he's
[1:49:36] suffocating and you're sitting there as
[1:49:41] a mother and father looking at your son
[1:49:44] and there's not a thing you can do see
[1:49:48] this is what God has allowed me to go
[1:49:51] through this and many other things like
[1:49:53] it well God allowed me to go through is
[1:49:57] to learn that God is in control even
[1:50:00] when it's hard even when it rips your
[1:50:04] heart out even when it's painful God is
[1:50:07] still in control and if my son had died
[1:50:12] by God's grace I would be here preaching
[1:50:16] the exact same sermon as I am today
[1:50:19] because the outcome is the Lord's and if
[1:50:24] we can just understand that and be in
[1:50:27] our place and understand that God will
[1:50:31] do all things this is what we were
[1:50:34] learning in a very painful very hard way
[1:50:38] and we hear of a team of doctors the
[1:50:40] alarms are going off
[1:50:41] eep-eep eep-eep eep-eep eep-eep eep-eep
[1:50:43] and they're running in and they're very
[1:50:45] serious and we're sitting there
[1:50:46] terrified my wife and I all we can do is
[1:50:50] sit there and watch we're just in shock
[1:50:53] don't even know what to do and they say
[1:50:56] these words oh we have heartbeat again
[1:51:01] when you hear those words you start to
[1:51:05] realize how fickle that life is it is
[1:51:09] the hand of God that gives life it is
[1:51:11] the hand of God that can allow life to
[1:51:14] be taken but there were some brothers
[1:51:17] that came in friends of ours that came
[1:51:19] in from out of town and my wife and
[1:51:21] there there was two different time two
[1:51:24] different moments during those two weeks
[1:51:27] my wife and I after those things that
[1:51:29] happened my wife and I stopped or at the
[1:51:33] end of the day we're totally exhausted
[1:51:34] in every way mentally physically Lord we
[1:51:37] don't know what to do don't know what to
[1:51:39] do other than just trust you every
[1:51:40] moment so we held hands we bowed our
[1:51:45] heads and we prayed we said Lord you
[1:51:49] gave us our son we dedicated him into
[1:51:52] your hands when he was born and we will
[1:51:54] not take him back now friends when I
[1:51:57] talk to you about trust I'm not making
[1:52:01] things up the things that are most
[1:52:04] precious is in his life to me are my
[1:52:06] family my wife and my children and I
[1:52:08] know that many of you feel the same way
[1:52:10] I know that many of you are facing
[1:52:12] things in your life that you feel like
[1:52:15] but brother I need something more God
[1:52:18] cannot give you anything better than his
[1:52:21] own word that's the best he can give you
[1:52:25] just earlier this year let me finish
[1:52:28] that testimony
[1:52:30] but my wife and I held hands and we
[1:52:34] committed him into the hands of God
[1:52:35] again weak Lord we know that we cannot
[1:52:37] hold him we know that we are helpless
[1:52:40] and the Lord had also sent a couple
[1:52:44] brothers from out of town two brothers
[1:52:45] and we stood around my son's bed and I
[1:52:48] still remember this is I've given his
[1:52:50] testimony many times it's always
[1:52:51] difficult for me because of it took a
[1:52:53] year after this for my wife and I to be
[1:52:56] able to talk about it openly it was very
[1:52:58] difficult we had to just shut down and
[1:53:00] just live day to day to day it was so
[1:53:02] shocking just out of nowhere for us but
[1:53:06] these two brothers came and we stood
[1:53:08] around the end of his bed we bowed our
[1:53:11] heads and we prayed and I cannot explain
[1:53:14] it to you but what I remember at that
[1:53:16] time myself I was staying in there but
[1:53:19] what I remember is an outside view of
[1:53:22] three angels standing there praying the
[1:53:25] angel of God standing around watching
[1:53:29] over my son brother that's spiritual hi
[1:53:33] friends I can't I cannot tell you what I
[1:53:37] have seen I can only preach the gospel
[1:53:40] that you will know that deliverance is
[1:53:42] real deliverance is here today for you
[1:53:46] deliverance is a person and his name is
[1:53:49] Jesus Christ earlier this year my my
[1:53:55] wife had a very difficult miscarriage I
[1:53:58] was 45 minutes away my wife called me
[1:54:02] she said she had just lost the baby I
[1:54:07] was 45 minutes away and my my wife was
[1:54:10] bleeding to death
[1:54:10] the bleeding wouldn't stop friends I'm
[1:54:17] not giving you this testimony to make
[1:54:18] you emotional I can't help it because
[1:54:21] it's difficult for me I've given this
[1:54:23] testimony elsewhere but I'll give it
[1:54:25] again I don't like sharing things that
[1:54:28] are personal to me but if it will help
[1:54:31] you I will encourage you I will give you
[1:54:33] a testimony because I went through a
[1:54:37] very difficult time after this
[1:54:41] my wife was dying quickly I called some
[1:54:44] people I called 911 friends saints of
[1:54:48] God very lovely people and they dropped
[1:54:50] what they were doing didn't ask any
[1:54:51] questions jumped into motion they were
[1:54:54] ministering to me ministering to my wife
[1:54:57] well brother did they stop and pray no
[1:54:59] they didn't they jumped into action
[1:55:03] they had already been praying they were
[1:55:05] already ready for action when God called
[1:55:07] on them well brother shouldn't should
[1:55:10] they pray you can pray while you're
[1:55:12] moving friends sometimes we want to be
[1:55:14] so spiritual you know I can't do
[1:55:16] anything God wants your body friends if
[1:55:19] we get in order when God calls on you to
[1:55:21] move you can move you can make a
[1:55:23] difference the body can minister to the
[1:55:27] body brother are you telling me not to
[1:55:29] pray I'm not telling you not to pray
[1:55:31] I'm telling you should be praying and
[1:55:33] you should be ready when God calls for
[1:55:35] you by God's grace these brothers and
[1:55:38] their brother and sister were were ready
[1:55:40] to go when we called in them and they
[1:55:42] called they jumped into action and by
[1:55:44] God's grace God saved my wife that baby
[1:55:49] was I believe it was about 13 weeks old
[1:55:52] and I held that little flesh in my hands
[1:55:57] you know in the human mind you think
[1:55:59] about all the things that could be
[1:56:02] that's very hard emotionally so when I
[1:56:06] tell you that you can't rely on emotion
[1:56:08] I'm telling you this because I have been
[1:56:10] there I have been through it like I said
[1:56:14] I don't like sharing personal stories I
[1:56:17] don't like sharing personal things but
[1:56:19] friends this is the God that I serve
[1:56:22] this God who is with us in the private
[1:56:25] moments in the difficult moments of life
[1:56:27] that's the God that I serve and if God
[1:56:30] chooses to take life if he chooses to
[1:56:33] give a life blessed be the name of the
[1:56:35] Lord we must come to trust him
[1:56:38] explicitly in every way in everything
[1:56:41] that we can lay everything at his feet
[1:56:44] and say god it's all yours
[1:56:46] and sometimes we say that with our mouth
[1:56:49] but when it comes down to it we're
[1:56:50] holding on to it friends the safest
[1:56:53] place
[1:56:53] you can be the safest place that your
[1:56:55] family can be is in the hands of God and
[1:56:58] when God sets out to do something let
[1:57:01] him do it
[1:57:02] don't set boundaries and say God you can
[1:57:04] do everything but don't do this don't do
[1:57:08] this don't stop telling God what to do
[1:57:10] just let Dad do God let God be God let
[1:57:15] God be your Savior and when God steps in
[1:57:18] when he begins to move on the scene
[1:57:20] something good will come out of it this
[1:57:27] isn't a joke no friends I'm not
[1:57:31] preaching this because it sounds good
[1:57:33] and I'm trying to win win brownie points
[1:57:36] with somebody as the world would say I'm
[1:57:40] trying to oh I'm trying to express to
[1:57:42] you friends when you get in life and
[1:57:44] death when it's real these are the
[1:57:47] things that can keep you and if you are
[1:57:49] holding on to something else it will not
[1:57:51] work it will the world will break you
[1:57:54] the devil will break your mind the devil
[1:57:56] will break your heart and when you get
[1:57:58] into those moments maybe by God's grace
[1:58:01] the words of God's prophets or servants
[1:58:04] will ring in your ears give it all to
[1:58:06] God let it go set it down at the feet of
[1:58:09] Jesus leave it there and allow God to
[1:58:11] step in that's when the work begins sons
[1:58:16] and daughters of the Living God knowing
[1:58:18] that God is the one that knows God knows
[1:58:25] better than we do we want what we want
[1:58:28] but God already has a vision if we can
[1:58:32] submit ourselves to the vision of God
[1:58:34] and allow the vision of God to unfold
[1:58:38] everything will be just fine let's
[1:58:41] continue on very quickly now let's go to
[1:58:48] Romans 11
[1:59:12] let me give you one more testimony this
[1:59:16] one's a little easier if anybody's
[1:59:19] having financial difficulties today you
[1:59:21] know that God is the king of all God of
[1:59:23] all things you know the first unfolding
[1:59:26] is that God is above all things and I
[1:59:30] was my wife and I were we had done our
[1:59:33] bills for the month and we were I don't
[1:59:37] know how much it was but it was several
[1:59:38] hundred dollars short we couldn't pay
[1:59:39] our bills we didn't have the money to
[1:59:40] pay our bills we bowed our heads in a
[1:59:44] very similar prayer Lord Jesus you know
[1:59:48] in my home I'm not to provide her God is
[1:59:50] the provider I can't do anything God can
[1:59:54] take my mind tomorrow just like that
[1:59:56] what can I do I can't do anything we bow
[1:59:59] our heads and said Lord Jesus you're the
[2:00:01] provider we trust you Lord we ask that
[2:00:04] you will take care of these things for
[2:00:06] Lord we we're doing the best that we
[2:00:08] know how to do but we've fallen short I
[2:00:12] was working at home and I went upstairs
[2:00:14] to where I had a desk and I sat down
[2:00:18] not 10 minutes later friends my wife
[2:00:22] comes upstairs with a check did you see
[2:00:25] this no I didn't see that it was a check
[2:00:30] for two or three times the amount that
[2:00:32] we needed in 10 minutes you know the
[2:00:38] beautiful thing about that that letter
[2:00:41] was already in the mailbox when I prayed
[2:00:43] I want you to think about that friend
[2:00:47] there might have been some process
[2:00:50] something happened some series of events
[2:00:52] that had been going on maybe for months
[2:00:54] and the moment that I prayed it arrived
[2:00:59] God is already working to answer your
[2:01:04] prayer before you prayed it God isn't
[2:01:11] surprised by your difficulties God is
[2:01:15] not surprised at the hard moments God is
[2:01:19] not surprised by anything he knows all
[2:01:22] things and if we can submit ourselves to
[2:01:24] division of
[2:01:25] guess what we will begin to realize more
[2:01:28] and more that he's already God he
[2:01:29] already sees it and if we can submit
[2:01:31] ourselves to his vision we begin to see
[2:01:33] what he sees and as we begin to see what
[2:01:37] he sees oh that doesn't matter the
[2:01:42] amount in my savings account that
[2:01:43] doesn't matter the amount in my bank
[2:01:46] account
[2:01:46] have you met my god have you met my lord
[2:01:50] my Jesus because that God the Bible says
[2:01:55] he has cattle on a Thousand Hills it's a
[2:01:57] way of representing he has well without
[2:02:00] measure he has if he needs to create
[2:02:02] something in your pocket he can create
[2:02:04] something in your pocket if he needs an
[2:02:07] out of thin air make something God can
[2:02:09] do that and sometimes we we believe yes
[2:02:12] God could do that but will he do it
[2:02:15] that's where we fail so many times
[2:02:18] friend but will he do it here in Romans
[2:02:25] the 12th chapter
[2:02:38] I went out when I pulled these verses
[2:02:42] this morning did not realize this verse
[2:02:46] was in here where we're starting from
[2:02:49] something we've been looking at much
[2:02:51] recently and this is what we're talking
[2:02:52] about today although we haven't talked
[2:02:53] to set it in this way but here we're
[2:02:55] gonna start here with what we're talking
[2:02:57] about today what we're talking about is
[2:03:00] a change of thought a change of vision
[2:03:06] if we see God's vision things look very
[2:03:09] differently than our own vision let's
[2:03:12] see how much it will affect us let's
[2:03:15] read the scripture and see what the
[2:03:16] Bible will tell us when our vision
[2:03:18] change when our mind changes let's see
[2:03:20] what happens
[2:03:21] Romans 12 verse number 2 and be not
[2:03:23] conformed to this world but be you
[2:03:25] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[2:03:28] you mean to tell me that just a change
[2:03:30] of thought can transform you brother
[2:03:35] Branham said if you have the right
[2:03:37] mental attitude the right mental
[2:03:41] attitude to the promise of God will make
[2:03:43] them come to pass let's continue on that
[2:03:47] you might prove what is that good and
[2:03:50] acceptable and perfect will of God there
[2:03:53] we go
[2:03:53] the will of God once again the will of
[2:03:55] God for I say verse number 3 for I say
[2:03:58] through grace through the grace given
[2:04:00] unto me that every man that is among you
[2:04:02] not to think of himself more highly than
[2:04:04] he ought to think but to think soberly
[2:04:06] according to God as have dealt to every
[2:04:09] man the measure of faith for as you have
[2:04:13] many members in one body all members
[2:04:15] have not the same office so we being
[2:04:19] many members are one body in Christ and
[2:04:21] every one members 1 excuse me and every
[2:04:23] one members one of another having then
[2:04:26] gifts differing according to the grace
[2:04:28] that is given to us whether prophecy let
[2:04:30] us prophesy according to the proportion
[2:04:32] of faith or ministry let us wait on our
[2:04:35] ministering or he that teaches on
[2:04:36] teaching or he that exhorteth on an
[2:04:39] exhortation he that giveth let him do it
[2:04:41] with simplicity he that ruleth with
[2:04:43] diligence he that showeth mercy with
[2:04:45] cheerfulness let love be without
[2:04:47] dissimulation abhor that which is evil
[2:04:49] cleave to that which is good
[2:04:51] kindly affectioned one to another with
[2:04:53] brotherly love in honor referring one
[2:04:56] another now how does this next verse fit
[2:05:03] with what we just read because it sounds
[2:05:06] so spiritual right let's see what what
[2:05:10] this looks like in verse very simply in
[2:05:13] verse number eleven not slothful in
[2:05:16] business fervent in spirit serving the
[2:05:20] Lord not slothful in business he is
[2:05:25] talking about how the body ministers the
[2:05:28] body and suddenly he's talking about
[2:05:29] being not slothful in business doesn't
[2:05:32] it mean that I need to go home and pray
[2:05:34] and talk to nobody for weeks and weeks
[2:05:37] he says be not slothful in business
[2:05:42] friends there's there is a contradiction
[2:05:44] happening here because the that
[2:05:46] sometimes the idea in our minds is that
[2:05:50] we have to do something that is so
[2:05:52] spiritual as that I heard them many that
[2:05:56] I say it is what many of the old-timers
[2:05:57] used to say it this way no offense that
[2:06:00] anybody is older than me used to say it
[2:06:03] this way sometimes we can be so heavenly
[2:06:06] minded that we are no earthly good we
[2:06:10] are trying to interpret the Bible in
[2:06:12] something so spiritually minded that we
[2:06:14] forget that here is the instruction be
[2:06:17] not slothful in business huh you mean to
[2:06:22] tell me I don't just forget about
[2:06:23] everything Oh what did Esther do King
[2:06:28] come home with me King come to work with
[2:06:34] me King what should I do now what should
[2:06:39] I do at this time what should I do it
[2:06:41] this time it is the life that God gave
[2:06:44] you that's what he wants he doesn't just
[2:06:48] want two or three hours on Sunday maybe
[2:06:51] a couple hours on Wednesday that's not
[2:06:53] what God wants
[2:06:54] God wants everything and when he says be
[2:06:58] not slothful in business what he's
[2:07:00] saying here what brother that's just
[2:07:03] carnal and
[2:07:05] it that sounds contradictory I know it
[2:07:08] but bear with me
[2:07:10] is it the Bible says talking about being
[2:07:14] an order the body million or be not
[2:07:16] slothful in business mother why are you
[2:07:17] emphasizing this because we should take
[2:07:20] the things that we that God is dealing
[2:07:22] with us on and apply it to what to
[2:07:27] everything I wake up in the morning and
[2:07:31] I brush my teeth or brother that's
[2:07:33] trivial you know if you meet if your
[2:07:36] wasteful with brushing your teeth and
[2:07:37] your teeth fall out and then we're
[2:07:38] complaining well well God why did my
[2:07:41] teeth fall out
[2:07:43] God gave you a toothbrush in toothpaste
[2:07:46] right well brother that's just simple
[2:07:50] but then we get into trouble because we
[2:07:52] don't do the simple things and then
[2:07:53] we're running to God knowing why did
[2:07:55] this happen because you didn't do two
[2:07:56] simple things that God gave you that's I
[2:08:00] think that's just the simplest example
[2:08:02] that we could possibly have
[2:08:03] well that just couldn't be worth
[2:08:05] anything this might be really trivial
[2:08:11] but I tell you what I'm just going to be
[2:08:13] real real simple after preaching and
[2:08:17] your mouth gets real dry for an hour and
[2:08:20] a half your breath doesn't smell so good
[2:08:23] right it happens that's kind of awkward
[2:08:27] I know I don't care it's just the way it
[2:08:30] is this body is dying it's just the way
[2:08:33] it is it's gonna keep on dying until God
[2:08:36] changes it that's the way it is and I
[2:08:39] tell you what if my breath was so bad I
[2:08:41] was trying to testify to somebody and
[2:08:43] that person couldn't hear what I was
[2:08:45] saying cuz my breath was so bad right
[2:08:50] that can't get any simpler being
[2:08:54] diligent in the small things we get
[2:08:58] slothful in the little things in life
[2:09:00] and then they hinder the work of God and
[2:09:02] then we cry out to God then why does
[2:09:05] this happen why does that happen because
[2:09:07] we're slothful in business I've never
[2:09:13] heard it friends I didn't plan it that
[2:09:14] way that is a I don't know why breath of
[2:09:17] all things but
[2:09:19] brushing your teeth but I don't think
[2:09:21] that could be any simpler right if we do
[2:09:24] that don't do two simple things that we
[2:09:26] struggle with those things because what
[2:09:28] we want is God's Word the we have the
[2:09:31] term the rubber eats that meets the road
[2:09:33] we want the word to sink in and begin to
[2:09:37] move us brother how is that deliverance
[2:09:43] just do what God gave you to do don't be
[2:09:48] slothful in business in the business God
[2:09:52] gave you don't be slothful well brother
[2:09:54] isn't it isn't it supposed to be
[2:09:56] spiritual friends David had victories in
[2:10:00] private before he met Goliath he had his
[2:10:04] little business in order and then God
[2:10:07] called him out on the battlefield why
[2:10:10] cuz David already had victory in his
[2:10:13] daily business he was out as a boy
[2:10:15] taking care of the sheep because that's
[2:10:17] what he was given to do well brother I'm
[2:10:21] just this you know little nobody and I
[2:10:23] don't really have anything significant
[2:10:26] to do friends I guarantee you that's
[2:10:28] what David felt like if you were to ask
[2:10:31] David as a little shepherd boy are you
[2:10:33] gonna kill a Goliath
[2:10:36] why would I'm nobody
[2:10:39] but then the lion came and he grabbed it
[2:10:42] by the beard was that David and he smote
[2:10:46] it I don't know about you like like I
[2:10:49] said about the Bears right they say well
[2:10:52] they're more afraid of you than you are
[2:10:54] of them if you believe that go ahead he
[2:10:59] got more faith than I do I think but
[2:11:01] David did it he grabbed it he killed a
[2:11:04] bear or killed the lion he smote it in
[2:11:08] private with no one there he was not
[2:11:14] slothful in his business and because
[2:11:19] everything was in order
[2:11:20] God said David today's the day and all
[2:11:24] that David heard was hey David take some
[2:11:27] food to your brothers that was God
[2:11:30] calling him today is the
[2:11:32] David you've been prepared you've been
[2:11:34] preparing it you don't even know it and
[2:11:36] now today is the day to go on the
[2:11:39] battlefield and here David is just think
[2:11:42] well I just do in the business that God
[2:11:43] gave me I don't my dad told me to do
[2:11:46] this so I'm out there taking care of the
[2:11:47] sheep I'm just a little boy and then
[2:11:50] there was something that just came out
[2:11:51] of David what Philistine dares to defy
[2:11:55] the armies of the Living God
[2:11:58] well what was David doing he was just
[2:12:01] doing his business he took the
[2:12:04] responsibility God gave him and took it
[2:12:06] seriously if we can take the business
[2:12:10] that God gives us seriously when God
[2:12:12] calls on us we got something there David
[2:12:16] had something to give because he was
[2:12:18] there in the wilderness playing smite in
[2:12:21] the bear smiting the lion he was
[2:12:23] training for a purpose and the day came
[2:12:27] when God said hey David your brothers
[2:12:31] are hungry okay I'll take him some food
[2:12:32] Oh Phil uh you you you Jews are so
[2:12:39] afraid who's talking like that who is
[2:12:44] this
[2:12:45] Oh David Shh go home David go home there
[2:12:51] was something in David that was being
[2:12:55] cultivated it was growing and when God
[2:12:59] called him he fit right where he was
[2:13:01] supposed to be there was strength that
[2:13:04] he brought where did it come from
[2:13:06] doing his business taking care of the
[2:13:10] bear taking care of the lion well why
[2:13:13] did he what does he say when he goes out
[2:13:15] before Goliath as God delivered me from
[2:13:20] the lion as God delivered me from the
[2:13:23] bear so shall it be with you Goliath he
[2:13:30] was training are you training do you
[2:13:34] want great victories before God uma
[2:13:38] asses again and I want you to consider
[2:13:40] in your heart if you want victories I'm
[2:13:42] gonna ask it in just a moment think
[2:13:44] about it do you want me
[2:13:46] if you want victories then raise your
[2:13:48] hand
[2:13:49] there's your testimony if you want
[2:13:52] victories then don't be slothful in the
[2:13:56] business God gave you take it seriously
[2:14:00] your business is not separate from the
[2:14:03] instruction of God your business is the
[2:14:05] instruction of God then go diligently
[2:14:08] and brother man says just go live humbly
[2:14:10] live a good Christian life do what God
[2:14:13] told you to do what brother that's just
[2:14:15] not big enough David had to do the
[2:14:17] little things and then when when the
[2:14:20] Google app was there David comes out
[2:14:22] there like this and David says haha you
[2:14:29] send a boy in God says I don't need a
[2:14:31] man to do their job I don't need a man
[2:14:35] to do that job I can send a boy that's
[2:14:37] all I need but that boy has been
[2:14:39] preparing for anyone younger ones that
[2:14:43] are here sometimes you feel like you
[2:14:44] can't work for God yes you can just
[2:14:46] don't be slothful in business whatever
[2:14:48] God gives you well brother what does
[2:14:50] that mean clean your room
[2:14:52] brush your teeth get up in the morning
[2:14:55] well brother I have a hard time you know
[2:14:57] being orderly I struggle with that I
[2:14:59] struggle being orderly but God gave me a
[2:15:03] responsibility and if I can't do it
[2:15:05] today
[2:15:05] I can still call upon God god help me
[2:15:08] and God will help me and before you know
[2:15:12] it
[2:15:13] God will then call on that thing and it
[2:15:16] might be here in the church maybe
[2:15:18] there's something else that needs to be
[2:15:19] done and the thing that you've been
[2:15:20] training on at home
[2:15:21] God can then pull on it brothers and
[2:15:24] sisters if this sounds like this is too
[2:15:26] simple or too deep I hope it doesn't
[2:15:28] I hope it's real simple but this is how
[2:15:31] the body is supposed to work everything
[2:15:35] this we're talking about God's vision
[2:15:38] amen
[2:15:39] everybody doing all right praise the
[2:15:42] Lord now we're going to close here in
[2:15:46] just a moment so let's turn to first
[2:15:49] Corinthians 12 and then we're actually
[2:15:50] going to come back to Thessalonians and
[2:15:52] then we're just going to we're going to
[2:15:54] close here like I said in just a moment
[2:15:59] first Corinthians 12
[2:16:10] everyone's still doing all right praise
[2:16:12] the Lord like we're like I said to the
[2:16:18] young people day I thank you for your
[2:16:20] patience and I know that we're slugging
[2:16:22] through right now we're slugging through
[2:16:24] that's what we're doing right now well
[2:16:26] we're gonna start going scripture to
[2:16:28] scripture like this sometimes you just
[2:16:29] feel like it's like oh we're just trying
[2:16:32] to push sometimes that's okay
[2:16:34] it's members not what we feel like it's
[2:16:37] God's Word first Corinthians 12 and 14
[2:16:49] first Corinthians 12 and 14 for the body
[2:16:52] is not one member but many if the foot
[2:16:56] shall say because I'm not a hand I'm not
[2:16:58] of the body is it therefore not of the
[2:17:00] body and if the ear shall say because
[2:17:04] I'm not the eye I'm not of the body is
[2:17:06] it therefore not of the body if the
[2:17:09] whole body were an eye where is the
[2:17:11] hearing if the whole body is hearing
[2:17:15] where is the smelling but now hath God
[2:17:18] set the members every one of them in the
[2:17:20] body as it has pleased who pleased God
[2:17:24] pleased him and if they all were on one
[2:17:28] body or one member where where were the
[2:17:33] body but now are they many members yet
[2:17:36] but one body and the eye cannot say unto
[2:17:40] the hand I have no need of thee nor
[2:17:44] again the head to the feet I have no
[2:17:47] need of thee we'll stop there let's go
[2:17:52] back to 1st Thessalonians how can I say
[2:18:00] to the hand I have no need of thee
[2:18:02] that's not how God made it to work well
[2:18:07] brother that that it's got to be more
[2:18:09] spiritual than that it is spiritual are
[2:18:12] you spiritual enough to catch it I don't
[2:18:17] mean
[2:18:18] disrespect anybody or challenge anybody
[2:18:19] in a carnal kind of way but friends I I
[2:18:22] was born and raised around a message and
[2:18:25] around people that just thought they all
[2:18:27] knew it and I've seen a lot of people go
[2:18:29] back out in the world and one of the
[2:18:32] things that Falls the first is a lack of
[2:18:35] responsibility in the church in the
[2:18:38] assembly lack of responsibility for one
[2:18:42] another
[2:18:43] what is God's vision that every member
[2:18:48] will work together here in 1st
[2:18:53] Thessalonians chapter 4 now let's read
[2:18:58] verses 8 to 12 again let's see the
[2:19:06] nature of the message here this is Paul
[2:19:08] again speaking to the Thessalonians
[2:19:10] verse number 8 he therefore that
[2:19:15] despiseth despiseth not man but God who
[2:19:18] hath also given unto us His Holy Spirit
[2:19:22] but as touching Lily love now this is
[2:19:24] him talking to the Thessaloniki living
[2:19:27] in that well the group of that were the
[2:19:30] Thessalonians I believe was called
[2:19:32] Thessalonica but I'm not sure but as
[2:19:35] touching brotherly love you need not
[2:19:38] that I write unto you unto you for you
[2:19:41] yourselves are taught of God to love one
[2:19:43] another he's saying you got this right
[2:19:44] and indeed you do it toward all the
[2:19:47] Brethren which are in all Macedonia but
[2:19:49] you but we beseech you brethren that you
[2:19:51] increase more and more and that you
[2:19:54] might be studied to be what quiet hmm to
[2:20:00] do what your own business and to work
[2:20:04] with your own as we commanded you that
[2:20:10] you may walk honestly toward them that
[2:20:12] are without those are that means that
[2:20:14] those that are not Christians and that
[2:20:16] you may have lack of nothing hmm but I
[2:20:20] would not have you to be ignorant
[2:20:22] brethren concerning them which are
[2:20:23] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[2:20:25] others which have no hope for if we
[2:20:28] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[2:20:29] even so then which are at which sleep
[2:20:32] in Jesus will God bring with him for
[2:20:35] this we say unto you by the word of the
[2:20:37] Lord I'm sorry we already read this
[2:20:39] earlier here a bit and because we broke
[2:20:44] this up this is this is where I wanted
[2:20:45] to say I wanted to stop here at verse
[2:20:46] number 12 so let's back up and we'll
[2:20:48] just read verse number 12 again but that
[2:20:50] you may walk walk honestly toward them
[2:20:53] that are without that she may have lack
[2:20:55] of nothing you know this is friends to
[2:20:59] me this is so wonderful so let's back up
[2:21:01] to verse number 11 that you study to be
[2:21:05] quiet and to do your own business and to
[2:21:10] work with your own hands as we have
[2:21:14] commanded you brother I need more than
[2:21:20] that there isn't there isn't God's Word
[2:21:29] we all said amen earlier God's Word is
[2:21:33] total deliverance do you know that every
[2:21:37] time that God comes he will announce
[2:21:39] through his prophets this is going to
[2:21:41] happen this is going to happen and
[2:21:42] everyone is looking for this grand
[2:21:44] scheme they're looking for the fireworks
[2:21:47] they're looking for the thunder and the
[2:21:49] Lightning's to just shake them to the
[2:21:51] point where all yet this is what God is
[2:21:53] doing but every time it comes so simple
[2:21:59] that everybody says but it can't be that
[2:22:03] it can't be a baby in a manger it can't
[2:22:08] be a little baby that comes floating on
[2:22:10] a raft and and the princess picks up a
[2:22:12] little baby that can't be the savior of
[2:22:14] the Jews it's just a baby it's just a
[2:22:17] man it can't be that salvation is
[2:22:22] already here it's it's got to be
[2:22:26] something that's coming it's not coming
[2:22:29] friends it's already here God's Word the
[2:22:34] fullness of the message is here today at
[2:22:39] any moment God is gonna say it's enough
[2:22:42] it's done
[2:22:45] but it needs to be something bigger
[2:22:47] there isn't full deliverance right here
[2:22:56] study to be quiet oh brother
[2:23:02] you know what about fighting Goliath now
[2:23:06] that's big study to be quiet
[2:23:11] David studied to be quiet and then he
[2:23:16] met Goliath and his spirit was quiet
[2:23:20] even when he faced a giant gods vision
[2:23:27] when you face the giant what's this I've
[2:23:34] already been training God's already
[2:23:37] taught me I already have knowledge
[2:23:41] I've already seen faith work remember
[2:23:45] add to your faith virtue add to your
[2:23:49] virtue knowledge in the little things of
[2:23:53] life God is teaching us faith and then
[2:23:57] he's adding to it virtue you start with
[2:24:00] today maybe it's brushing our teeth it's
[2:24:03] a simple example but I like simple
[2:24:05] examples because we all have to brush
[2:24:07] our teeth we all wake up in the morning
[2:24:09] and we don't like the way our breath
[2:24:10] smells right I mean if you don't tell me
[2:24:15] your secret but if we can be diligent in
[2:24:20] the small things right we do that with
[2:24:23] our children teach them to small things
[2:24:25] God's doing the same thing with us learn
[2:24:28] the small things and raise up and you
[2:24:30] feel like it's a bunch of rules today
[2:24:32] but remember that when God is teaching
[2:24:34] us it's not about the rules we're
[2:24:37] learning what God is teaching us we're
[2:24:39] learning the little lessons that we
[2:24:41] might grow up in the stature of a
[2:24:42] perfect man that everything might be in
[2:24:44] this place but don't shirk the little
[2:24:46] things don't let go the little things
[2:24:49] have every little element every piece
[2:24:51] that God gives you in your life in order
[2:24:54] I need something bigger there isn't
[2:24:57] something bigger for
[2:24:59] the hardest things to I could tell you
[2:25:01] from experience if you can conquer the
[2:25:03] little things the big things are nothing
[2:25:06] it's the little things that happen at
[2:25:09] home when you're alone that are the
[2:25:12] biggest challenge where does your mind
[2:25:15] go
[2:25:16] are you disciplined when you're alone do
[2:25:19] you do things that you know no one else
[2:25:21] will ever know do you still do the right
[2:25:23] thing do you still do what God told you
[2:25:27] to do when no one sees it that's what
[2:25:31] David did
[2:25:32] and when God needed David God needed
[2:25:37] David because he prepared him for a
[2:25:40] purpose when God called on David David
[2:25:44] said yeah I'll go I already have
[2:25:48] knowledge I've already seen what faith
[2:25:51] can do oh it's just a Philistine but
[2:25:55] Dave he's so what are you gonna do David
[2:25:59] it doesn't matter you don't understand
[2:26:03] how big God is you see I've already met
[2:26:06] God and that that Goliath he's nothing
[2:26:09] where did David learn it at home in
[2:26:14] private he learned his lessons but then
[2:26:18] when it was time to minister to the body
[2:26:21] he was ready and everything just fit
[2:26:24] together just like that praise the Lord
[2:26:30] I believe that does that that come out
[2:26:34] kind of simple hey man I pray that it is
[2:26:39] I pray that it's simple for you well
[2:26:41] brother I need something greater there's
[2:26:43] nothing greater than God's Word complete
[2:26:46] deliverance well brother where does
[2:26:48] faith come in faith is everything the
[2:26:51] message is Jesus Christ faith is
[2:26:53] everything it's faith in God's Word that
[2:26:55] we stand upon and if you believe God's
[2:26:57] Word and do God's Word well I need faith
[2:27:00] on these things okay the word saying is
[2:27:03] study to be quiet well what kind of
[2:27:05] faith does that that take try it and see
[2:27:11] I didn't see because if you study to be
[2:27:14] quiet you know what happens the devil is
[2:27:16] there Oh devil sit down devil sit down
[2:27:20] and wait your turn I'm reading my Bible
[2:27:24] and one of the time okay now now devil I
[2:27:27] have time for you
[2:27:28] you get in line you can't say that to a
[2:27:30] devil sure you can study to be quiet
[2:27:34] that your spirit is quiet and when your
[2:27:38] spirit is quiet for I wish I could
[2:27:40] express it the way I see it because
[2:27:42] here's David looking at Goliath you want
[2:27:46] anything but he's so big
[2:27:50] so what have you seen my god can I tell
[2:27:57] you about him you know what I can tell
[2:27:59] you about him but you have to learn for
[2:28:00] yourself we were giving an example to
[2:28:03] the kids I'll end with this so for the
[2:28:05] young people yesterday we're giving an
[2:28:09] example of what the message is and they
[2:28:13] hold it but one to another when the
[2:28:16] message is given as let's give today for
[2:28:18] an example God laid this message on my
[2:28:21] heart I was praying a pray Lord just
[2:28:25] nothing had peace nothing at peace and
[2:28:26] the Lord gave me a little thought and
[2:28:28] just begin to build what's in my heart
[2:28:32] is I try to give it to you I I can ask
[2:28:37] this is why I asked earlier do you want
[2:28:40] victory we all agreed yes we want more
[2:28:43] of God we want victory that's our
[2:28:46] testimony if you want it then God will
[2:28:50] give it to you but when it comes don't
[2:28:53] be surprised when it doesn't appear
[2:28:55] flashy when it seems like it's less than
[2:29:00] what you expected because that's the way
[2:29:02] God always does it oh it's so simple
[2:29:09] that the world doesn't want it my
[2:29:14] brother I just I don't know then ask God
[2:29:18] to open your eyes if you believe me to
[2:29:21] be God's servant if you believe that God
[2:29:23] has been here at all today
[2:29:25] then you pray in your heart that God
[2:29:28] will show you what I'm just trying to
[2:29:31] express from the bottom of my heart I
[2:29:33] have seen the things were in my life
[2:29:35] where I have failed it's because I'd
[2:29:37] already failed in the little things I've
[2:29:42] already failed
[2:29:43] I've already been slothful in the little
[2:29:46] business that God gave me to do and then
[2:29:48] when the big battle came I fell and then
[2:29:50] here I all why did I fall in a big
[2:29:52] battle because I failed in the little
[2:29:55] things does it did the Prophet not
[2:29:58] preach God revealed in simplicity that's
[2:30:03] what it is friends and I pray that
[2:30:06] something today has struck for you to
[2:30:08] encourage you God is calling you to be
[2:30:11] part of the body to minister to the body
[2:30:13] every member supplies no one can say
[2:30:16] that you're not needed sisters brothers
