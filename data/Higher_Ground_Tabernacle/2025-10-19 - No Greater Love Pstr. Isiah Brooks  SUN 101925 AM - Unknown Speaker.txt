We give honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ this morning. Thank God for everybody being here. Amen. We just uh want to draw your attention to the scripture according to St. John 3 verse 17- 17 &gt;&gt; and then we'll go to Romans. for chapter 17- 21. &gt;&gt; We ought to be the happiest creatures in the world. [Music] &gt;&gt; Coming to church should never be a burden. &gt;&gt; As the word of God said, I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. I am so grateful &gt;&gt; to be one of them and I trust that you are as well St. John 3 beginning at the 13th verse. And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up. &gt;&gt; And who that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, oh I love this, that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. &gt;&gt; Romans 4, &gt;&gt; beginning at the 17th verse. I know some have gone to uh brother Joseph's wedding and I just pray &gt;&gt; that God will give them a safe trip home. While while I'm thinking about it, &gt;&gt; we we will not have service on Wednesday. I've had uh two close I call them brothers, relatives, however you want to call it. Brother um Bobby Wartz &gt;&gt; passed a few days ago. &gt;&gt; He is the man who was responsible for harmony in the desert. Desert. &gt;&gt; Then my pastor's wife died. Yes. &gt;&gt; A couple of days ago &gt;&gt; and uh so we'll be uh traveling to both of those funerals. &gt;&gt; One is on Thursday &gt;&gt; and hopefully the other one will be on Saturday. So pray for the warts family &gt;&gt; the warts family &gt;&gt; and uh pray for brother Charles Anderson's &gt;&gt; George Anderson &gt;&gt; Charles Anderson &gt;&gt; Charles Anderson &gt;&gt; and and his family &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans the 4th chapter &gt;&gt; 17 to the 21st verse As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed, even God who quickened the dead, and callest those things that be not as though they were. Who against hope believeth in hope that might be that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken. So shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was con but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Gracious Father God, we thank you for your grace. We thank you for your mercy and all that you do for us. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for the good times. We thank you for the bad times because we realize Lord things have to be however you have determined them to be they will be. And so therefore we glorify you because of our life. It could not have been any better than it has been because you knew every choice &gt;&gt; and every decision &gt;&gt; we would make. But one thing I glorify you for because you said all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord. We thank you, Father God, that even when we mess up, you know how to restore. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father God, &gt;&gt; for being who you are. &gt;&gt; And there is none like you, for you are the only true living God. And in your name, Jesus Christ, we thank you, Father God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I have been just enjoying the word &gt;&gt; and um reminiscing &gt;&gt; over the service that we had uh just the other day. And I wanted to kind of reassure you this morning that we have no need to worry. &gt;&gt; Those of us who are chosen, those of us who are elected, God is in full control. I think one of the elements that we do miss when it comes to our salvation, we want God to love us. &gt;&gt; But my question is to this morning, how much do you love him? &gt;&gt; Because love is reciprocated. &gt;&gt; It is not a one-way street. Love goes both ways. And we've often heard people say, &gt;&gt; "I love him because he first loved me." &gt;&gt; One of the things that we know by way of this message is that the Lord is soon to come. However you want to phrase it, &gt;&gt; we are about to make a translation. &gt;&gt; And we are behind time. &gt;&gt; I believe that we are living in the longsuffering of God as it was in the days of Noah. &gt;&gt; Judgment should have happened &gt;&gt; years ago, &gt;&gt; but God has extended his love. uh uh for us. So because the bride must make herself ready my my subject this morning would be &gt;&gt; no greater love but if I had a subtopic it would be captured &gt;&gt; by his love. &gt;&gt; Only a few people in here perhaps knows what it means to be captured by love. It means you have become imprisoned by the love that you have towards someone and sometimes you might wish wish that you did not have those kind of feelings. But it seems like no matter what the person may do to you, You love them still. &gt;&gt; You are captured, &gt;&gt; imprisoned by such a love. &gt;&gt; And that kind of love is not a bad love. &gt;&gt; It's just that kind that will bring pain because people will never be what you want them to be. And so is it with us. &gt;&gt; The only reason why &gt;&gt; we become to uh we we come to the place &gt;&gt; that God has uh ordained us to come to is because of his sovereign love and his sovereign grace. The prophet of God says it like this in the serpent seed paragraph 70. &gt;&gt; He said, "But I want to ask you something. &gt;&gt; Is there eternal security?" &gt;&gt; The Bible said. So &gt;&gt; the Bible said that that our names &gt;&gt; were put on the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before the world ever began. &gt;&gt; Now it takes something in you to believe that. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about your head. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about in your heart. Because when you realize &gt;&gt; you are secured &gt;&gt; eternally, &gt;&gt; it produces a love. &gt;&gt; It's like when people do things for you &gt;&gt; and you know you you don't deserve it, &gt;&gt; but they do it because they love you. Something registers in the human heart. and and you'll say to yourself, "I'll never forget that person, &gt;&gt; you know, true love &gt;&gt; constrains a person. &gt;&gt; It literally compels you. It's like a force. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh, you know, you you you might say, &gt;&gt; uh, I'm not going to ever forgive you, &gt;&gt; but real love, true love will force you &gt;&gt; to forgive, &gt;&gt; it is something that you won't and cannot control. &gt;&gt; And so is it with God. &gt;&gt; God is never out of control. But his love toward us &gt;&gt; is love is controlled. &gt;&gt; It's it's a constraining force &gt;&gt; that when you do wrong &gt;&gt; that love of God brings you back to a place to do right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now when we look at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and we see by God's grace, &gt;&gt; the Bible said that he set his face like a flint, &gt;&gt; he was determined &gt;&gt; to go to Calvary, even though he knew what his punishment would be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That same kind of love &gt;&gt; and constraint &gt;&gt; was given to those early church believers. Remember in the age of Smyrna when they were persecuting the church, killing them, &gt;&gt; ripping the babies out of uh the mother's womb, &gt;&gt; burning them, &gt;&gt; crucifying them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Feeding them to the lions. But because they love God so much &gt;&gt; and God loved them, &gt;&gt; God projected his grace, his sovereign grace. That's what I'm trying to tell you. If you love God and really love him, when you come to the end of all that you can do, God will project his grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, he's a problem solver. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is there anything too hard for God? Our problem is &gt;&gt; we don't love him like we say we do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because when you love somebody, &gt;&gt; you can't help but to talk about them. Y'all hear what I'm saying? When you love somebody, you want to communicate. You want to talk to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And sometime text messages &gt;&gt; just won't do. Hallelujah. Because you want to see their face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're the only generation &gt;&gt; that God loves so much that God loved so much &gt;&gt; that he actually showed his face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He came down. [Laughter] for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't waiting for you to come up. &gt;&gt; He came down &gt;&gt; to fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; And he's still here to fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think about it now. God chose Abraham &gt;&gt; and Abraham &gt;&gt; was the natural seed. &gt;&gt; And in the natural, &gt;&gt; the Bible said that Abraham never staggered at the promises of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And though his body was dead, &gt;&gt; he couldn't produce children. He called those things that be not &gt;&gt; as though they were. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We say that so often &gt;&gt; until it's almost a cliche. &gt;&gt; Faith versus reasoning. &gt;&gt; Remember I preached that last me last meeting. &gt;&gt; Faith versus reasoning. Satan will always have you reasoning. Satan, I mean, Satan will always have you reasoning psychologically. &gt;&gt; Is it logical? Is it logical? Nothing is logical with God. &gt;&gt; Everything is by faith. &gt;&gt; You can't mathematically figure him out. It makes no sense. But that's how God works. God does not work by science. &gt;&gt; God works by faith. &gt;&gt; Because he himself believes in his own word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to see something happen. You start praising God for the things you have not yet received, but you believe God and you know you're going to receive it. &gt;&gt; Guarantee God will come on the scene. That's how it works. &gt;&gt; Abraham, where's the baby? &gt;&gt; I don't know, &gt;&gt; but he's coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many years has been Abraham? &gt;&gt; 21 years. &gt;&gt; 22 years. &gt;&gt; 23 years. &gt;&gt; Yep. 24 years. 25. &gt;&gt; Then the baby came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Abraham never staggered. &gt;&gt; His confession &gt;&gt; was that God promised it and God cannot lie. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, our pastor uh last &gt;&gt; was Sam was what's his name? Sam. &gt;&gt; Yes. He came and he gave us a beautiful message. But he also talk about that there's another page or another document. &gt;&gt; And and that's the way God always works &gt;&gt; because we realize &gt;&gt; that Daniel should have died. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The whole world was against him except God. And the thing that Daniel had on his side is because he loved God no matter what the decision would have been. &gt;&gt; You understand me? If God wants me to die at the mouth of a lion, so let it be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I have confidence that my God will not fail. I don't know how he's going to do it, but I know that I love him and he's proven his love to me. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me here because I'm going tell you something. If you really love God, he will prove his love to you. I'm not talking about saying it with your mouth in your heart. If you really love God, He will always show up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now what happened? &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; showed Nebuchadnezzar &gt;&gt; who was really God, &gt;&gt; right? And he put out a decree. &gt;&gt; From this point on, &gt;&gt; everybody must worship Daniel's God. &gt;&gt; And if you don't worship Daniel's God because he is God, &gt;&gt; you will be put to death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, what are you saying? Tying it over into our message. Hallelujah. Cuz he paralleled Daniel with brother Brandon. Hallelujah. And if you don't believe Elijah's God, &gt;&gt; if you don't worship Elijah's God, you would be put to death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But how do you worship Elijah's God? &gt;&gt; The only way you cannot worship Elijah's God, &gt;&gt; you must worship him &gt;&gt; in spirit. I'm going to say it again. &gt;&gt; In spirit &gt;&gt; and in truth. &gt;&gt; I didn't say truth &gt;&gt; only. I said spirit &gt;&gt; and truth. &gt;&gt; In other words, you got to have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost Elijah had Elicia had it. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? And the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. must understand something transpired in our day. &gt;&gt; Is that right? As I said, &gt;&gt; uh when it comes to the message, &gt;&gt; we're no longer just part of the seventh church age. But God has brought something down. [Music] &gt;&gt; He brought the capstone down. He brought him. Hello. &gt;&gt; Now you understand this. &gt;&gt; It was God who came down &gt;&gt; call him the capstone. &gt;&gt; But he that's what Bible said that the same this the the the cornerstone which was Jesus Christ has now become the head &gt;&gt; of the corner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that you better understand what I'm saying. When we get to heaven, &gt;&gt; Jesus himself &gt;&gt; will be on the throne. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not only him &gt;&gt; in the throne room, &gt;&gt; but his bride will be there. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Because he said, "If you overcome, I will allow you to sit in my throne &gt;&gt; as I have sat in my father's throne." Understand what you're given. If you can see that you're giving something that you yourself could not have earned, hallelujah, it ought to make you happy. You don't have to work for it. You don't have to beg for it. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. You don't have to do nothing. Here is the works of God. &gt;&gt; Believe on him &gt;&gt; whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in this last day, God sent Elijah. Oh, you say, "Brother Brooks, you mean to tell me in order for me to do the works of God, I must believe that William Brandham is the messenger of the hour." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when I say believe, I'm not talking with your head. I'm talking in your heart. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if you truly believe it, you will do as Jesus said. If you love me, you'll keep my commandments. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One thing I'll say then, &gt;&gt; you're captured. &gt;&gt; If if if you truly it are the seed of God. You couldn't get away if you tried. You understand me? I mean, he you you stick tighter than gorilla glue. &gt;&gt; You can't get away. &gt;&gt; You're trapped. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You know, there really are some natural love affairs like that. There are some natural love affairs like that. you love your wife or you love your husband &gt;&gt; and you don't even think about leaving it &gt;&gt; and when you do you really figured out how much nonsense that is &gt;&gt; hallelujah you might say oh I can't live with him but you now have crossed that line I can't live without him &gt;&gt; oh come on somebody I know y'all ain't that unhappy Oh my god. I'm 48 years uh in my marriage and I'm enjoying it. Do I have a hard time? Absolutely. But I never thought one time about divorcing my wife. Never. &gt;&gt; And if I had ever thought it, I would tell you. But my life has never been that bad &gt;&gt; where I want to break the vow of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me hold on. Let me move on cuz some of y'all getting there something happening here. I don't know what that is. &gt;&gt; Stop that nonsense. If you thinking about divorce and forget it, &gt;&gt; you promise God you'll go through the bad and the good. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm still looking for some mouse to move. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus defeated Satan by his word. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way you'll be able to defeat him. &gt;&gt; By his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, Satan will always attack you. those comments, that last comments really put a damp or something down up in here. So, somebody's going through something. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, God just spoke to you. &gt;&gt; There is where Satan's attack is on the word. &gt;&gt; And as I said last week or the time I spoke last, you always have reason versus faith. You're going to reason it. &gt;&gt; You're going to think what I need to do is right. &gt;&gt; But I tell you like this, &gt;&gt; the only way to be a winner is to take God at his word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Understand your life is not a mistake. Everything that has happened to your life or in your life whether it's good or bad God ordained it. &gt;&gt; And that's why the Bible says in all things give thanks. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Listen, I refuse &gt;&gt; to let anybody &gt;&gt; control my joy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yo, you you might be wrong, &gt;&gt; but but listen, you're not going to control my joy. &gt;&gt; If I won't let the devil do it, &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let you do it. Oh, well, you hurt my feelings. Hurt my feelings. &gt;&gt; Well, first of all, Lord, help me cuz I'm supposed to be dead anyhow. Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; Listen, something might smack you, &gt;&gt; but you get over the pain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You get over the pain and then you thank God for the pain. What do you mean, brother? Thank God for the pain. &gt;&gt; It's building character. Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows how to try to kill that temple. Some of y'all have &gt;&gt; is that right? &gt;&gt; I'm coming. Don't worry. I'm coming by the grace of God. Now, we understand &gt;&gt; the altar of God. Remember before most of the time &gt;&gt; when Israel will offer a unto the Lord a sacrifice, &gt;&gt; it was it was always in a high place somewhere that it could be seen. Hallelujah. Now the heathens did the same thing. But whenever you offer a sacrifice, you want it to be seen by others &gt;&gt; by others. Y'all understand me? When you say a praise, &gt;&gt; you don't say, "Well, you know, I just praise the Lord." No. &gt;&gt; You want it to be seen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Cuz I know some of y'all think, "Well, they going to think I want to be something." No, they don't have to think that &gt;&gt; because you are something. &gt;&gt; You are the bride of Jesus Christ and you need to praise your husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need to thank God for every moment of this time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you realize no matter what I go through here, &gt;&gt; I have a home beyond the river. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, you don't may not understand this. &gt;&gt; But this life is going to make you enjoy that life in a better way. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me say it like this. Do you think that thief on the cross wasn't happy when he died? He didn't go to hell, &gt;&gt; but he found himself in paradise. Think about it. All he had stolen and may have killed a few people was totally erased. And now he was sitting in paradise. He didn't have to pay anything to get there. Y'all don't understand me &gt;&gt; because here it was. &gt;&gt; I'm almost jumping here and I'm trying not to. But but understand when Jesus Christ came let's let's let's use John when John saw Jesus &gt;&gt; John says listen this is the one &gt;&gt; that has been preferred &gt;&gt; before me. John said, "I'm not even worthy &gt;&gt; to unloose the lashes of his shoes." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said that the law &gt;&gt; from Moses was given &gt;&gt; and that law extended all the way up to John. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; All the way up to that time. Everybody was being judged by the law. And the Bible tells us that the law can't give you life. Because if the law could have given you life, &gt;&gt; we would not have needed grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And here is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Coming in changing the time, &gt;&gt; changing the season. Hallelujah. And changing the administration &gt;&gt; of God &gt;&gt; from law to grace. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So you got to understand Jesus ministry could never be understood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By the sinner nor the religious people. Because in the religious sect, they still were living by the law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Think about it. The woman caught in adultery, it was the law that said she should be put to death. But Bible tells me that Jesus came with grace and truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love this. And and guess what? The law challenged the word. They challenged they challenged Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they were breaking the word &gt;&gt; and tried to challenge the word. Because they were supposed to bring male and female. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying? The law condemned. &gt;&gt; She should have died. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did Daniel break the law? &gt;&gt; He broke the law. He should have died. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The grace was administered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who administered the grace? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't the king. &gt;&gt; It was out of the king's control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the fourth man in the fight. And that same God that was in the fire with the Hebrew voice was the same God in the lion's den. Y'all hear what I'm saying? When law should condemn all of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Grace steps in. This is what you got to understand. There was no perfection of the church ages. Hallelujah. because they did not have the perfect one. But my God, your God, Elijah's God, &gt;&gt; came down, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, as the headstone as a mighty angel. Revelation 10, he came down. And when he came down, he came down with grace. Hallelujah. He said grace and we responded with grace. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. It's amazing grace that you and I could live in such a wicked age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But guess what God said for this generation? Where are your accusers? I've been caught. I've been caught. I've been caught. I'm a sinner. Save by grace. Save by grace. &gt;&gt; And guess what he said? &gt;&gt; Let him, &gt;&gt; let him &gt;&gt; who is without sin, &gt;&gt; let him cast the first stone. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me say it to you. Cast the first stone. Oh, but the brother did this and the sister did this. Hallelujah. How &gt;&gt; can you lay any charge to God's elect? Hallelujah. It is God who justifies. See, y'all get quiet now because you want to lay some kind of child on the elect of God when you cannot. It is God who justifies. Y'all better hear me. It's God. I don't care whether it be man or woman. If they have a power to repent and ask for forgiveness, &gt;&gt; you can't do a thing. &gt;&gt; You can't do a thing. &gt;&gt; But except the Bible says if you can't forgive your brother, then God can't forgive you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, what you going to do with that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, you and I must understand we must hold the righteous condition in order to for a bride to be produced. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You understand me? &gt;&gt; It's it's it's when you come to recognize that you love God no matter what, &gt;&gt; then God can give you the Holy Ghost. I'm going to love God more than I love my my wife, my mama, my daddy. &gt;&gt; Ain't nobody going to stop me from loving God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, it's the truth. If they want to leave me, leave me because I'm never alone. &gt;&gt; He said, I'll always be with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, God. Is that right? I don't have to worry &gt;&gt; about my Lord betraying me. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me here. But I know &gt;&gt; that I stay faithful &gt;&gt; unto him. &gt;&gt; Even when I won't &gt;&gt; be faithful, &gt;&gt; he'll be faithful to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet says. God only provided place of worship. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now think &gt;&gt; these men &gt;&gt; when was was they called and was put into this condition. &gt;&gt; These Pharisees so y'all understand me. &gt;&gt; They've got to be Pharisees. &gt;&gt; They have to be there. There have to be Sadducees. &gt;&gt; There have to be three kinds of believers always in order for God to fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now it goes on says &gt;&gt; and look what he says. But Jesus said in vain you worship me. &gt;&gt; Worship him genuine worship. &gt;&gt; True worship from their hearts. In vain you worship me teaching the doctrine. There are traditions of man. &gt;&gt; You see one time that worked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Lutheran doctrine worked &gt;&gt; at one time. The Methodist doctrine worked &gt;&gt; at one time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Pentecostal doctrine worked. But when God began to do another administration, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, brother, I don't know what you're talking about." &gt;&gt; To prove my point, &gt;&gt; I think it's in 1957. When America was weighed in the balance, &gt;&gt; hallelujah and nobody wanted to repent. &gt;&gt; The gospel was being preached &gt;&gt; by Billy Graham, &gt;&gt; Billy, &gt;&gt; by or Roberts &gt;&gt; and by William Brham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there were missionaries traveling all over the world. &gt;&gt; But here in America, we turn the gospel down. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Baptist, &gt;&gt; Methodist, you name them, &gt;&gt; they all turned it down. &gt;&gt; Now they worship &gt;&gt; in vain. &gt;&gt; Sincerely worshiping in vain and only those &gt;&gt; who moves with the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; will be accepted. Amen. for a rapture. Y'all understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we we see these things. &gt;&gt; Let me see finish. He said, "If I taught you a Methodist message, it would take no effect on you. This is bride time. If Moses taught the message of Noah, it would take no effect, if Jesus taught the message of Moses, it would take no effect because the the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that gives for that seed. See, it won't grow any other condition. It must be the condition that it grows in. So you understand, you can sit in any kind of church you want to. But only the message can make you grow. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It is the only thing that satisfies the true seed of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, that's what John said. John said, "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that you can understand this message is grace. This message is truth. It's not law. It's not dogma. Hallelujah. I do what I do because I love him. And he said, "If you love me, you'll keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's why they couldn't understand Jesus. You mean to tell me you're going to heal on the Sabbath day? Can you imagine if you were sick and you got to wait another day in order to get well &gt;&gt; because you're not allowed to pray on the Sabbath day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus turned around and he said, "I'm the Lord of the Sabbath." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because Sabbath is another word for rest. Come unto me all ye that are later and heavy later and I will give you rest. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What we failed to see is why God saved us. Hallelujah. In this day, let's go to the parable. They're calling people. &gt;&gt; The domination wouldn't come to the wedding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nobody would come. The report got back to God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Is that right? All of them were called every church age. Even up to the Pentecostals, they were called to the wedding, but they were what? Too busy. Too busy. Too much property. Too much land. Too much this, that, and the other. Hallelujah. Then God said, &gt;&gt; "Go to the highways. &gt;&gt; Go to the hedges. &gt;&gt; Go to those who are nobodies. &gt;&gt; Call them. Bring them &gt;&gt; because I want my house full. That's the ministry of the bride. Y'all better hear me. There are people out on the streets &gt;&gt; cast away poor among us fed up with church but they want to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Somebody help. Oh, you don't want to go there. But I got a quote for you so you understand. It's not my thoughts. These are not my thoughts. Brother Bradam said before the wedding could take place. We must do our job. And he says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; We must have the ability of laying hands or healing the sick. I get it. I'll come to it in just a moment. Hallelujah. But how are we going to get there? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He preached a message. El Shai, &gt;&gt; which means the breasted one, which means the strength giver. Hallelujah. And then the reason why we're so weak in faith &gt;&gt; because we have not been nursing the breast of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the last time you listened to a tape, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the last time you stayed on your knees and prayed till you felt God come through. Hallelujah. But that's where your strength is. You're going to always be a weak Christian as long as you don't play the game. You come to church and hear the word. You don't come to church &gt;&gt; to examine brother Brooks. I wonder if he's going to preach the right thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me ask you a question. Why do you believe that what you believe is right? &gt;&gt; That's right. It's only the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, wait a minute. What are you saying, brother? &gt;&gt; The woman at Simon's house, &gt;&gt; I'm using the woman because she represents the church. The woman at Simon's house. I I love this. I was going to preach on the alabaster box and hadn't gotten there yet. But my point is &gt;&gt; this lady &gt;&gt; who was a known illame woman &gt;&gt; what we call today a prostitute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how she made her money. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But she heard perhaps that this woman caught in adultery was forgiven by Jesus. Y'all hear? You know how testimonies? He said testimonies are are not important. Yes, they are. Queen of Sheba said, "I heard." Queen of Sheba said, "I heard about your church services." Hallelujah. I heard and I have come to see if what I heard is real. Wouldn't that be wonderful? If we could go out and testify that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and God is doing the miraculous here, &gt;&gt; because that's what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; He's not calling you to sit up here and just eat lunch and be fat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's fueling you. He's giving you energy so you can get out there and testify. But if God hadn't done for nothing for you in a long time, you're all dried up. &gt;&gt; Dried up and prickly &gt;&gt; like a sticker. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hadn't had rain in your life in a long time. &gt;&gt; People can't even talk to your mouth because you snappy snappy. Hallelujah. You need some rain. &gt;&gt; You need some water. You need an experience. &gt;&gt; You need a refilling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've got to fight for this thing. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Judah &gt;&gt; one. Jude second chapter. I just want to see if somebody will turn the pages or not. There's only one book of Jude one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Beloved, &gt;&gt; third verse. When I gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, &gt;&gt; and exalt you, &gt;&gt; that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saint. &gt;&gt; You know what that word contend means? Uh &gt;&gt; it means to fight &gt;&gt; fight. &gt;&gt; You have to fight to keep it. You know, &gt;&gt; you have to fight to keep your joy. &gt;&gt; Fight to keep your peace. &gt;&gt; You have to fight to keep sanctified. &gt;&gt; It's a battle. &gt;&gt; Like I said, but it's a battle between reasoning and faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For there are certain men &gt;&gt; crept in unawares &gt;&gt; who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, &gt;&gt; ungodly men. You mean in the church? In the church, people are ordained to be devils in the church. That's why you can't look at everybody and you can't say, "Well, so and so ain't doing it. Why should I do it? &gt;&gt; I don't care what so and so ain't doing. &gt;&gt; What that got to do with me? What does that have to do with you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, you live it. You don't know who so and so is, but you better know who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what what they used to say? I can't go up there. I can't go to that church. All they got up there is hypocrites, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, if you come up in here &gt;&gt; with that kind of attitude, &gt;&gt; you make one more hypocrite, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, let let's move on. turning the grace of God into lasciviousness and denying the Lord, the only Lord God. &gt;&gt; You say, how do they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness &gt;&gt; by telling the people it doesn't matter what you wear. And then people come to church, &gt;&gt; shorts, &gt;&gt; tights, &gt;&gt; skirts and dresses above their knees, &gt;&gt; sexual provoking clothing. And these salt called Christians are walking in the spirit of lasciviousness, lust, &gt;&gt; it makes a difference. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Have you ever gone to a church &gt;&gt; and you got to turn your head, &gt;&gt; brothers, &gt;&gt; in church? You say, "Well, I'm in the message in church." Cuz y'all know sometime them dresses so tight. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad somebody said that's right. &gt;&gt; The sisters ain't going to say it. &gt;&gt; But it's true. &gt;&gt; Come on, brothers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those of you who are red-blooded, &gt;&gt; how can you not look? [Music] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, it your your eyes you're designed that way. &gt;&gt; I ain't gonna go too deep, but it's the true, &gt;&gt; you know, and and I'll be honest with you, there are times I had to go. I had to leave. Y'all say brother Brooks leaving his wedding early. Yes, I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about people in the wedding. I'm talking about people that comes. &gt;&gt; But let me stop because I'm gonna make somebody upset. But the truth of the matter is it's so tight. &gt;&gt; I just wonder how they got in it. How can they breathe? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your whole dress is a girdle. &gt;&gt; Let me move on. But that's the seriousness. &gt;&gt; And if I don't preach on that, God will judge me. That's right. I see it. &gt;&gt; And my point is I'm a shepherd. &gt;&gt; I have to call things out. Oh, people say, &gt;&gt; "But is grace, brother Bruce." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But your dress, &gt;&gt; come on, brothers. Sometime y'all have it too tight. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Them pants so tight. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. That ain't right either. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm talking to somebody this morning. &gt;&gt; But my point is, I can't allow that kind of a thing to creep. &gt;&gt; I have to preach it. Whether you like it or not, I don't care about tradition. I care about the word. Hallelujah. Why? Because when I allow us to do that, then I am denying what the word says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We must work. We must dress godly. Think about it. If you can't wear your dress in heaven, you not you don't need to wear it on her earth. Same with the brothers. I know brother Brandham said when he saw the bride, she had loose garments on. loose flowing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Let me move on cuz I didn't mean to go there, &gt;&gt; but God is speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, understand this. &gt;&gt; You can't just dress any kind of way. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord knows my heart &gt;&gt; and I know your heart, too. [Applause] You know, we called a cult. Did y'all know that? &gt;&gt; People call us a cult. &gt;&gt; Because our women dress like women. &gt;&gt; And our brothers dress like brothers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our women still wear dresses. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't nobody making you do it. You're doing it because the Holy Spirit is leading you to do it. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; If a sister got dressed right, if she doesn't have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; she got two wardrobes. &gt;&gt; She got a wardrobe she wear at home and a wardrobe she wear to church. As if God don't see you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling y'all. See, see, I can tell I'm right cuz y'all sister smiling. &gt;&gt; Y'all know it's right. &gt;&gt; But that's wrong. &gt;&gt; Let me move on. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me I have to say it. &gt;&gt; I was telling a brother the other day about brothers wearing shorts. &gt;&gt; Lord, look at that. And the one brother said, "Oh, I didn't know that. I didn't know. I was supposed &gt;&gt; I said, "Yeah, brother Brandon said, "Brothers, don't wear shorts cuz that's women underwear." &gt;&gt; And he said, "The man who wears shorts, it belongs to the big society. [Music] And I told him, I said, "Brother, let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; You don't need a doctrine to tell you that. When I got the Holy Ghost, I was a swimmer. I love to swim." After I got the Holy Ghost, I went to the swimming pool. I walked &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden a wind came from somewhere, &gt;&gt; blew across me. &gt;&gt; I looked down and something said naked. &gt;&gt; I ran home in my nakedness. See, God showed me it was wrong. That's why I can't understand. If God showed me that, why isn't he showing you all that? I was in a Pentecostal church then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not message. &gt;&gt; Y'all, oh Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; God will fix it for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have to fight. Contend for the faith. &gt;&gt; And I told that brother one thing. I said, "Listen, I'm off my notes now. I'm off my notes." But I said when I go swimming, it's been a long time. &gt;&gt; I said every time I've gone to the beach or wherever I would go, &gt;&gt; I said I make sure I have everything. &gt;&gt; I look like a scuba diver. &gt;&gt; I have on my long sleeve or whatever. I have my pants all the way down to my ankles. God is my witness. Everything get wet. You say you're going to look strange in the eyes of the people. I want them to know I'm strange. &gt;&gt; I'm just Let's Let's Y'all okay with that? &gt;&gt; We got a few more minutes. I know y'all. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm talking as a father, as a friend, and as a pastor. &gt;&gt; We don't make you do anything around here. &gt;&gt; Is whatever you choose to do. But it's it's my duty to bring the knowledge to you. Now that you have the knowledge, it's your duty to seek God whether the knowledge that I just gave you is true. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that you understand and I'm getting ready to close on this. The message &gt;&gt; cuz there's no way I can finish. The message of the hour &gt;&gt; has encaged me &gt;&gt; by his love. &gt;&gt; And every believer is engaged. &gt;&gt; But in this generation, we're not building a house. &gt;&gt; God is. Amen. We don't have to build a temple &gt;&gt; because we are the temple &gt;&gt; and we are different &gt;&gt; from all of the ages. &gt;&gt; This is why the word of God say they cannot be complete &gt;&gt; without us cuz we take on the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and understand by the grace of God, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that what God is trying to do with us, &gt;&gt; he's going to do it. &gt;&gt; The Bible said the work that he's done, &gt;&gt; he shall complete it. &gt;&gt; Good to see you, Sister Joselyn. So we realize &gt;&gt; by God's grace &gt;&gt; I said that to you because I always miss you when you leave. I don't get a chance to talk to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Okay. Don't mean to embarrass you, but you know I I I do miss everybody that's not when you miss it. You miss you miss. But but my po my point is &gt;&gt; you and I are special like brother saying a special class of people. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And if you can continue to believe that you re you'll come to the place, okay, I've done wrong. I've done wrong here. I've done wrong here. But there's still something in my heart that wants to please God. And as long as that's in your heart, God still can deal with you. &gt;&gt; And not only that, but God will deal with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As I said, &gt;&gt; El Shadi, &gt;&gt; El Shai, &gt;&gt; it is the uh worker with the uh breasted one. He is to give you strength every day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In other words, we don't look to the pastor. Oh. Oh. This is not a man age. &gt;&gt; This is the Holy Spirit age. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is the one that we supposed to be drawing from. I heard brother Bam said it like this. He said, "When you pull on on El Shad, &gt;&gt; the breasted one, he's working with God." &gt;&gt; He said, "Then God pours his strength into you, the believer." &gt;&gt; So what are you saying? If you're going through something, you have to say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I am weak, &gt;&gt; but thou art strong." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I need you &gt;&gt; to strengthen me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give me a word of encouragement. Show me a scripture. Let me listen to a message. Whatever it is, Lord, I come to you because you are the strong tower. And the Bible said the righteous run at their end and they are safe. What you don't understand is &gt;&gt; perhaps you do. I don't know. &gt;&gt; But you are the completion. &gt;&gt; You are the completion &gt;&gt; of God's body. &gt;&gt; What you talking about, brothers? Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is the male &gt;&gt; and the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is the female. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he can't even be complete &gt;&gt; to every member of his bride &gt;&gt; is complete. &gt;&gt; And he's building you, &gt;&gt; directing you, instructing you. &gt;&gt; He picks you up when you fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He heals you when you're sick. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He becomes your friend, &gt;&gt; when you have no other. Hallelujah. Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; So, he's always there. How many of y'all believe that he's even there? Like that song say, like the song say, even when I don't know it, he's always working. When I don't feel him, he's working. When I don't see him, he's working. He's always working. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To bring you to perfection. to bring me to perfection. &gt;&gt; Potentially, we already have it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God want to see manifestation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Coming from the message marriage and divorce. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 241. He said at the at that end there will be one Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; and his bride, &gt;&gt; many singular. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; There was one David on the throne, &gt;&gt; one king &gt;&gt; after God's own heart &gt;&gt; with 500 wives. &gt;&gt; Jesus sitting on his throne. Hallelujah. in the millennium &gt;&gt; with a wife &gt;&gt; like it was at the beginning &gt;&gt; created out of the earth &gt;&gt; by the hand of the almighty God &gt;&gt; in the resurrection many members there you are hallelujah woman &gt;&gt; struggle to be that &gt;&gt; come into Christ when you're not be in the filthy mess out there, &gt;&gt; then you you not be in the filthy mess out there. &gt;&gt; But long as you're just a church member trying to live moral and good yourself, you'll never make it. Neither can a man make it outside of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As Paul went on to say, &gt;&gt; but there in Christ, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, there is neither male nor female, they're all one. &gt;&gt; Right? So when Christ come into you, you become one with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, you may have been the the weaker vessel, &gt;&gt; but because you come into him, &gt;&gt; you have his power. You have his strength, &gt;&gt; you have his faith, &gt;&gt; everything Jesus got. &gt;&gt; When you join &gt;&gt; in that invisible union, you become one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The power of creation is in you. &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. So I want you to understand, &gt;&gt; you can't look at America &gt;&gt; and expect America to have a great revival. &gt;&gt; No, the revival is in you. &gt;&gt; They their days is over. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be this great I know what it looks like. It looks like the American getting ready to have a revival. But brother Brandham said, &gt;&gt; "When all those denominations get together like that, it would only lead them to the mark of the beast." So all these people, listen, look how they can talk about Jesus better than you, &gt;&gt; right? I I said, "Lord, what is this?" Half naked and everything and praising God. Hallelujah. I've seen him at the restaurants, &gt;&gt; Bible open, &gt;&gt; Bible studying, &gt;&gt; and a beer. &gt;&gt; Huh? You say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; They say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? And they say they're the church, &gt;&gt; but they are, &gt;&gt; but we're the bride. &gt;&gt; We have a difference. &gt;&gt; We're not worried about being saved. &gt;&gt; We're saved. But the point is, we want to make a rapture. We want to be bride. And the only way that you can be bride is that you receive his Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on, one more. One more. Let me let me let me let me read this for you. &gt;&gt; In the message El Shadi, &gt;&gt; every preparation is made. &gt;&gt; Healing is already tone atoned for. &gt;&gt; Sins are already atoned for. &gt;&gt; All things are ready. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what he said? All things are ready. &gt;&gt; Everything Jesus did made all things ready. He said, "Come." That's right. The wedding supper is set. Excuses are made. &gt;&gt; He said, "Go in." &gt;&gt; The last call was, "Go get the sick and the last call, a campaign of healing just before the wedding supper." Now, you can say, "Well, Brother Brooks, &gt;&gt; that happened with Brother Bam." And it did, &gt;&gt; but it wasn't supposed to stop. &gt;&gt; Did not Elisha or Elisha &gt;&gt; do miracles after Elijah was gone? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And now you see where we at. Go get the lane, &gt;&gt; the halt, &gt;&gt; the blind out of the street, &gt;&gt; highways, &gt;&gt; hedges, &gt;&gt; hedges, and bring them in. &gt;&gt; Heal them, &gt;&gt; and let me show my mercy to them. &gt;&gt; Then they'll they'll they'll believe me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's God's last call. supper call &gt;&gt; is healing. &gt;&gt; The last call. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, brother." &gt;&gt; Well, then that's why the Bible according to Revelation &gt;&gt; said the spirit and the bride come. &gt;&gt; You can't get away with it. You can't get out of it. The supernatural is supposed to be among us. Not with the preacher, the pastor only, the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; In my last quote, he said that's the truth. &gt;&gt; America has all has absolutely sinned away of grace. You mark it down on a book. &gt;&gt; You'll never have a universal revival in America. We passed that about three years ago. &gt;&gt; I'll never it'll never be a revival. &gt;&gt; Some of you young people mark down my word. &gt;&gt; Not word down for that. &gt;&gt; There'll never be a nationwide revival. &gt;&gt; No more &gt;&gt; like the Billy Sundays. Billy Sunday. You'll have little spurts up like that till Jesus come. &gt;&gt; But it'll never be. &gt;&gt; God has turned from it &gt;&gt; and gone to the foreign nations. That's where the people come. &gt;&gt; One sign from the Lord done. &gt;&gt; Thousands &gt;&gt; run to the altar &gt;&gt; of heathens. And it could be done over and over to the bunch of Americans that's been taught this way. So let me say it like this &gt;&gt; just to bring it to your attention. &gt;&gt; And if that be the case, &gt;&gt; where do you fit? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you. Brother told his wife, We're not Americans. &gt;&gt; We're pilgrim and strangers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We only belong to one land &gt;&gt; and that's the land of promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you see how come no you can witness to people show them the truth. &gt;&gt; I tried to show a brother a friend of mine yesterday &gt;&gt; and you know gave him a church age book all of that &gt;&gt; and we went back after I left him. &gt;&gt; Let me put it this way. He rejected again. But this man, &gt;&gt; he could go out to malls and place &gt;&gt; dressed like Superman, &gt;&gt; Spider-Man, &gt;&gt; Spider-Man. &gt;&gt; Witnessing people, witnesses to people about Jesus, you get him in a restaurant, &gt;&gt; he'll out talk you &gt;&gt; and he's talking about Jesus. And I'm like, Lord, what is this? What kind of zeal is that? &gt;&gt; See, but when you're not required to do nothing, &gt;&gt; you can be as happy as you want to be. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm trying to say? They will always outshine you. &gt;&gt; They got better choirs, &gt;&gt; better musician, &gt;&gt; better singers. But man, you get the preacher &gt;&gt; with a little bit of organ behind it. You got something. &gt;&gt; But none of that means anything to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even in Esther day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Esther didn't dress fancy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She dressed simple. But all the other churches, all the other women, &gt;&gt; they had on all their jewelry. They thought that was going to impress the king. But they failed to forget. They failed to re realize. It was the king who gave them the jewelry. Remember this. In the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; there's Jehovah Gyra. Jehovah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord will provide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's still the same. &gt;&gt; Right. Abraham trusted him though. &gt;&gt; Without faith, it's impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; Y'all look, I'm telling y'all, you you may not hear what I'm saying now, but you going to need this. Things are not going to get better. &gt;&gt; That's why I try to tell people, you better enjoy your burgers. Enjoy your steaks now. &gt;&gt; Cuz when time get hard, at least you have memory. Enjoy your life. This is what Satan is trying to do to you. Cut your life. Take away your joy. Take away your peace. And to be honest with you, we could all be justified. &gt;&gt; But the point is, how many of us you can do like Job? &gt;&gt; The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Though he slay me, yet I trust him. Hallelujah. No matter what I go through, I am in love with him and I trust him. And I know that no matter what I go through, &gt;&gt; it's for my good. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Be in love with him. &gt;&gt; Ask God to increase your love for him. Hallelujah. But in order to love him more, you got to get rid of your idols. And I don't know what they are, but you know the thing that takes more of your time than reading the Bible or listening to a message. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. [Applause] You know, I can't I can I I can how can I say it so you understand the Bible said judgment begins at the house of God. That scripture has never changed. &gt;&gt; It has and it never will. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon even said if a man don't preach a closline gospel, He hasn't even preached the gospel. &gt;&gt; A closed line. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I I say it in in love. I am so glad I wasn't raised up in this message. Because I find out that so many people raised up in this message &gt;&gt; have a hard time receiving the Holy Ghost. know how to repent. &gt;&gt; And only God can give you a revelation of that. &gt;&gt; But I know what I used to be &gt;&gt; and I know how far God has brought me. And even though &gt;&gt; I might bear scars, &gt;&gt; but the scars do not describe who I am now. &gt;&gt; You understand me? &gt;&gt; What I used to be, &gt;&gt; I am no longer. You know, it's like a man who was an alcoholic or a woman. &gt;&gt; Alcohol burns &gt;&gt; their lips &gt;&gt; and so they have like a two-tone. Don't be looking at nobody lips &gt;&gt; because I know that certain things will change. But but because a person still have that discoloration doesn't mean that still drinking. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? Let me say it like let me say it in a plain way. &gt;&gt; When I was in Lima, &gt;&gt; there was a man. He's now close to a hundred. &gt;&gt; He's lived that long. &gt;&gt; But in his lifetime, &gt;&gt; uh he was a man who liked men. &gt;&gt; Men who like men and he always had that little thing about him. But that man repented. &gt;&gt; He married a wonderful woman. &gt;&gt; He has children. He has grandchildren. And many people would look at him as though he was the same. &gt;&gt; But he was a man I never had to worry about. He lived it. You understand me? He lived it. He lived the life. God changed him. &gt;&gt; So nobody can't tell me what God can. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you were born with a wilted hand, &gt;&gt; God can straighten it out. But some people believe, well, I've been like this all my life. And that might be true. But God come to change that life. God comes to to fix that. &gt;&gt; And I know for a for a fact that the message that we preach The gospel of Jesus Christ that we preach, which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today forever. &gt;&gt; He's still a creator. He's still a restorer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's so true. You never judge a book by the covering. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Every one of us have come through bad stuff. There are things that we would never want to tell nobody. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God still had mercy. &gt;&gt; His love for you was projected and he gave you grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what we need to learn how to do is give our fellow man grace or our sister grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't scone nobody for something if you've never been there yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know how people say, "Oh yeah, you smoke them cigarettes, man. You ought to quit. &gt;&gt; It ain't always easy like that. Why don't you go pray with that person?" But you know what we'll do? We'll gossip. &gt;&gt; That ain't helping nothing. A Christian, when you see your brother or your sister overtaken with a fault, what's the Bible say? You go to that person in meekness and help that person be restored. &gt;&gt; That's what love does. &gt;&gt; That's what love did for you. &gt;&gt; He saw you in every one of us. in the eyes of God, &gt;&gt; in the eyes of his holiness was by sin. &gt;&gt; But God rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; you got to love everybody. And one way of fixing your attitude in closing, when you see somebody that you think, you ought to say &gt;&gt; that could have been me. You don't scone somebody because they're different. We come here to help people change. That's what the Bible is for. That's what it's for. This is a hospital. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we want when people move out and leave out here, we want them to walk out here spiritually healthy. &gt;&gt; That's the way I see it. &gt;&gt; And I don't know who I said that to and why I said it. But I say it like this. Until you come to love what you call the unlovable, you haven't reached that. You're not ready for heaven yet until you come to love what we call the unlovable. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our heavenly father God, we come before you, Lord, as humbly as we know how. We thank you for your grace. We thank you for your mercy. We thank you for your love, &gt;&gt; Lord. In that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. &gt;&gt; You're lovely, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to love you the way you love me. &gt;&gt; I want to love your people the way you love me. &gt;&gt; I can't do it on my own. So we asking, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; that you would fill us completely &gt;&gt; with the divine love that will constrain us every way to always obey your word. Let not your word be a burden to us, &gt;&gt; but let your word &gt;&gt; be our joy. Bless each and everyone here this morning. &gt;&gt; Change the attitudes. &gt;&gt; Change the differences. &gt;&gt; Change the difference. &gt;&gt; Help us now, Lord, &gt;&gt; and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; Let the word spoken this morning wash away all unbelief. Father, we'll be careful to give you the praise, glory, and honor in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. A love of God. His great heart [Music] open can never take.
