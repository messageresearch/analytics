TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you you thousands of Tirana which lighteth every man that cometh into the world you from sons of God even to them that believe on his name please name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of faith but the will of God been with me and the world was living flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth John Barrowman is crying saying this was he of whom I state he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he walks before me and notice his fullest have all we received and grace for grace for the law was given to by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ man no man I've seen Valley in the target they only begotten Son which is inclusive of the Father he hath declared them let us pray father we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord without you Jesus we are nothing the more I see you unfold yourself the more I see how a little bit small I am and then the same token oh god I see how great you have made us from a piece of saying to a great start blessed service this morning has continued to bless us forgive us of all our sins strengthen us Lord in the time of our weaknesses and will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray you may be seated I'm going to use this great hard work in just a moment and it'll benefit you better understand it in just a minute I was thinking about God and the his vastness there's no way that we can ever comprehend it he is eternal meaning he has no beginning no end but either so I had thought him as the man of God said there was a time that he would have chosen if he had been in the mind of God and Bob who said to him what time would you relative you would like to come down to earth to declare me or to justify that I'm real he said this would be the day and I can truly say I'm saying I would not have wanted to go come in a time where they were killing with swords but you gotta realize that this age is the most difficult at all that's right because even in that day they understood the enemy today we failed to see who the enemy is the enemy is not to a brother or sister the enemy is say to himself and to be honest with you you are erased because the world to do good and the world to do evil is within you that word is always being a model the God we when we think about evolution we think about people or a monkey first of all involving into a mirror we think about dinosaurs and all of these things that you know we will get no lizards sometimes it sees that I've seen and this is eternal if you can copy here without them you see [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you see [Music] [Music] such a romantic drama [Laughter] [Music] [Music] I'm trying to bring something that I just enjoy because I see something too there's no issue because God has placed you in a decision you're free warrior angels and God plays you there so that you can make the choice just like Melanie make the choice you must make you will you remain at the truth the Tree of Life a where you go with the tree of they're not a good enough and that's what's so sad because there's tons of people who are now just feeding off the tree of knowledge of good and people in the church when you can see that there is one God and you think it's that's the tree of knowledge because the school in theology will never reveal to you right I think beyond so did you understand there's nothing I'm gonna tell you something if you put God first and everything else you can have as many degrees as you wanted there's nothing wrong with but God I know I like to just plain right and here we are we are living in a day that just amazes me if you played your music before we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we pray for my daughter she's not been able to come to church like she desire would you just open that door for her Lord thank you Father God we pray that you bless her Lord Father buying those spirits of things ayat e Satan the blood of Jesus Christ is against you and I command you to take your hairs off a car tire in the name of Jesus Christ your eyes o Satan and Jesus Christ name we thank you Lord Jesus for our victory in Jesus Christ's name we pray lower so many things I wanted to say I'm trying to say this phone for maybe as in progress with this it become clearer to you so much solely to bring a change in your life it has and I'm beginning to really see that although she's of God those people what I'm trying to say I know you're tired of this stressful situation these things that we go through that really has no value to it you know you think about deepen and correlate raised rubber gets most they tried to be somebody all that for someone it would be seen but then they found out that that that that spirit that motivated them to do was not the Spirit of God that's why these young brothers know God it's coming up to be out of harmony with father give them a thirst yes that they may thirst after you the Living God then all these worldly things of God when God give them grace to harm themselves to their parents that they would be obedient because in this last day that the spirit of that is contrary to you were said in these days children will be disobedient to parents oh god help them down Lord Jesus give you grace with a hallelujah that they may understand you will in his heart to do it forward we call the Lord to serve your purpose and your purpose only so let it be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray father we come before you right now Lord we pray for little Judah Lord Jesus God you know his makeup you know what it's all about Lord Jesus but there's nothing too hard for you bring young boy but father we pray that you give him Grace and strength give him understanding and maturity well God that he would be an honor to you know give him a thirst or God to serve you to love you break and destroy the yokes of the enemy and you know in Jesus Christ we pray father God we know Lord Jesus Michaela they desire your Holy Spirit I pray father God that you don't let that desire die in her when I pray father that you read come to that far and bring it so father God this yield thirst and Harmer for you lord is in a way the Lord has never been before help her now bless her now Lord we realize she's in that angel God with the world but father I pray that you would keep her we dedicated her to you yes and she is yours have died no way in her life and Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
