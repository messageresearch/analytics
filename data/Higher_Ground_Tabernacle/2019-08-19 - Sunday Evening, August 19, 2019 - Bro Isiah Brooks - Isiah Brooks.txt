change he's made in my life since Jesus came into my life he brought joy and happiness hallelujah you know sometimes we take it for granted but it's a blessing to be able to come to church as often as we do it is such a blessing and I'm so grateful actually I thought it was owner already brother I'm sorry gotta cut it off but he's such a blessing and you know I I just would never want to lose this but we know that it's coming the government one day is going to shut these kind of churches down I don't know whether I'll still be living but I always will be living what I mean on this side or the dimension I don't know but I wonder what it's going to be like to those who had opportunity to come and did not come what it will be like when you really miss having church and fellowship with the saints of God you love the Lord let us turn to 2nd Samuel please will continue to thought God creating himself in you you are the earth you know and God is creating himself in Earth I'll never forget that that scripture will always ring in my heart that will be done in earth as it is in heaven it's so amazing how Satan will cause you to forget sometime the various scriptures that you so treasure because he knows that those scriptures that you treasure those who scriptures that give you strength so he realized that it does it in such a simple way and we we just sometimes forget but I thank God for the Holy Spirit because the Bible says that the Holy Ghost will bring all things back to your remembrance at this time in my life I need only go and not just a live but the brain things back to my remembrance yeah that's why it's important to conversate around the scripture with your fellow brothers and sisters because things that we say unbeknownst are unaware are things that they need when they don't well won't even say is what they need or need it anyway second concept' second samuel 5th chapter we're gonna start reading at the 9th verse 1st verse I'm sorry then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and I flesh also in I'm past when Saul was king over us thou wast he that led it out and abroad in Israel and the Lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people Israel and thou shalt be a captain over Israel so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron and King David made a lead with them in Hebron before the Lord and they anointed David king over Israel it's amazing because I believe if I'm correct David received three great anointings anointed by Samuel anointed again here is king and he's finally anointed and and you look at these things because God is perfect in three and we realize Amen that is a significant that we must understand that David had more than one experience of being anointed sometimes we get anointed by God and we think wow that's wonderful and we always looking back but I believe that we continue with God we get more anointing and you know the Bible says David was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned for forty years in Hebrew reign over Judah seven years and six months and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty in three years overall Israel and Judah and the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jaypee sites the inhabitants of the land which spake of the David saying except thou taketh away the blind in the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking David cannot come in hither you know color you know use the poor people as a barricade you know nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion the same is the City of David and David said on that day whosoever get it up to the gutter and smite at the Jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of David so he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said the Bligh and the lane should not come into the house so David dwelt in the fort and called it the city of David David built around about the meelo and inward and David went on up on and grew great and the Lord God of hosts was with him that's what I like and the Lord God of hosts was with him let's pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for enabling us to be here once again this evening we counted as a privilege and an honor many times the flesh get weary but the Spirit in the soul is is it's ready Lord we thank your father for being so good to us in these last four days as men hearts are failing for fear it's as men began to cool off their steel those who help you have left as a witness there is a bride Lord and there is a people that's fired up for you there is are people that are looking with expectation on the translation and and father we thank you for your perfection we thank you for your loving kindness and your tender hand Lord we would not be here had it not been for you thank you for Calvary thank you for shedding your blood for us thank you for cleansing us daily and Lord thank you for your mercy and grace that seemed to that didn't do it to all generations Lord we thank you for serving a god that's inexhaustible Lord a god of patience and a God of love o God Allah God of vision Lord we think your father bless each and every one of us tonight and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as I was saying this morning how that we look at at a situation and and we see by God's grace that David Osher type of Christ and David didn't want anything in the city that would defile the city and the David that we're talking about is the saying the Lord Jesus and I don't think the people realized what's really happening now we seen the prophet of God go I've seen and there's a place in brother Brendan's life it was so dark the Lord didn't allow him to see any father I think it was even during the time of his thinking that the rapture was going to happen in 1977 many men fell away after the rapture didn't take place but brother Branham never gave us dust at the Lord and one thing brother Branham said he says I'm a preacher and he said preachers do make mistakes he said but when I say dust said the Lord he said that's not me it'll never fail and you and I we have seen this message go through transitions and now we're at the very end of it all we have seen God do mighty things you know as I was studying the Word of God the greatest battle ever fought brother Branham transition the soul in the spirit now if you were not understanding where he was coming from you see God allowed things that happened just so because he knew they were going to come those who would look for fault and what you gonna do with Elijah when he told those people how to worship their God why don't you go cut your swelling to shout scream louder da-da-da-da-da you know but those instructions weren't for the bride and he got him all in the frenzy till they began to cut himself they got so desperate you know wanting to hear from their God and he larger knew they weren't gonna hear from their God the God was dead only one true and living God and there are things in this message it's for the foolish and an unbeliever and there are those things in the message that's only for the bride but the bride knows yeah exactly those things that are said there for her when we look and we see by God's grace that God always furnish manna for his bride you know brother Branham talks about Elisha during the famine and he said he call he said that crow came and he fare Elijah did you know that brother Branham liking that crow as a black man go look it up and he said Amen God used the black man to feed Elijah and you don't believe that but let me say you don't believe it but listen even when Elijah who was how William Branham was in this day God sent them where to the colored people it was the colored people down in there and that's why his mother-in-law got so upset and call those people trash it was more than one reason remember brother Branham said that they were having a meeting and they had it in a certain place and because everybody could come north of the South could comes over in that meeting brother Branham winning he saw the real man and the ambassador he said amen they were they were right he said I even sent down by a colored boy did me and they said William Branham William Branham is there anybody he said he is he so I said all of that you know we don't go with color lines and all these things but brother Brandon brings that out for whatever reason he that's what he said the whole point is is to know that God would take a man that was so great in his time and send him to a place that was forbidden off limit the trash of the earth to learn something about God he is not what we think God has in such a way a meant that if we're not careful we'll miss him usually God shows up in the areas that you least expected and we find out in the day it meant that here God comes along and and you look at these things that's in the scripture and had it not been for a prophet to tell us that every word has a meaning there's a purpose behind every word in this Bible the jots and tittles have significance and we came to know and then that when we study now we come and we work and see these words because before we read a word oh that's what it means but now we know that these words when we have to look them up I mean the definitions literally brings the picture into focus I've read the story before is what I'm trying to say we know how David gets Jerusalem he hires people to go conquer falling building all of that David said on that day who shall get it up to the gutter and I look that word up it means the state or abode of those who live in a degree in a degradation a filthy place of misery a mess of misery he goes on and he tells us he said now those places got to be cleaned up kill it all destroy it all and I thought about that and I says Lord is that the way it is that God is now shaking he's shaking the message with every kind of shaking doctrine ohms and everything else now he's going for the gutter he's going for those that are blind and those that are lame amen they would defile the city you said that in Scripture yes it is revelation 21:27 says there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whose work whatsoever worketh abomination or make a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen and he told those studies I'll make you captain as you go if you go in and kill everything else and bring me Jerusalem hallelujah and you and I must understand amen even in this day that's exactly what William Branham ministry did even though we're living in a time where who saw the will shall come this message has come to transform you if you come here that you blind you're supposed to receive your sight if you come here Lane used to count supposed to come walking at home is that right that's what the third Pole was a man they walked him to the tip they didn't know how but they walk out and they were made whole what made of home somewhere there is a people that really will is believing this message right remember brother man who said that the last outpouring of the Holy Spirit he said we will have one he said but at that time the door of the Gentiles will be closed help us Lord it won't be all god I want to be better know sure that anointing has come to anoint you to make you exactly who you are and if you are bribed you will be anointed with such an anointing hey man you will become a super man I didn't say a super woman I said a super man ah because the Prophet says she becomes him will be so much like him but right now it's the time of cleansing hallelujah and the cleansing is not by water you can wash yourself with the water of the world every day but that's not the cleansing that God wants to see God wants to see the cleansing by fire because God cannot occupy you is that right he cannot fully come into you until the fire comes and burn all the demons away hallelujah that's why sanctification is not just the answer to the problem you've got to go further with God hallelujah sanctification is your walk with God hello though you'll be anointed you've got to be willing to give it up whosoever will let income you've got to be willing to give up you've got to be willing a meant to be cleansed but because God cleanse you doesn't give you a ticket or seat in heaven it doesn't stop there amen it is God preparing you tearing you for I eat eternal city and in this eternal city and then the only way you can get there you must be fired baptized is that right yeah man brother brother tells us about it and he says I think is even a message countdown how did the world the earth itself has to come stages justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and this baptism of the Holy Ghost makes room for the Holy Ghost himself is that right oh we thought it's the Pentecostals oh praise God I've been baptized with the Holy Ghost you just begun you just came into life you've just been begotten but you still need a birth you really need a holy goes far baptism right that's where the battle in the mind is because now you've got to kick out all the inhabitants of the land everything that's in your flesh and in your fleshly mind you by the holy spirit must kick them out is that right regardless to the category it falls under there's only three categories of sin that lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life but everything else falls under those three categories and you've got to get rid of it all but how am I going to get rid of it Lord how am I like we always have help me Lord God is the only one that can give you the fire baptism is that John's doctrine or not John said I can baptize you with the holy water hallelujah but he that cometh after me he's the one that can baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire I can't give that to you brother Branham couldn't give it to you it takes so wholly goes himself to give you the fire baptism hallelujah is that right oh it's the truth I believe in brother branham's day if he could have given everybody the Holy Ghost he would have given it to them that's just how much love he had right but he understood one thing the Holy Ghost is only for the elected seat of God hallelujah oh yes the Pentecostals they out there getting the Holy Ghost some of them but it's only in the spirit so you can't get into the heart because they don't they won't the veil got to be ripped now they need a word that can penetrate to the soul walk and rip the soul apart ah come on somebody even it's gotta be a word Amen they could that can bring that van to a place where God can go in and sit on your throne hallelujah amen and is the soul see that's why God did what he did amen because in the soul brethren said there's only faith and doubt is that right now some people could confuse because their praise he's called the soul the spirit and spirit the soul but the pony is those who are the bride we know who he's what he's talking about a man by faith huh it wasn't by emotions that God Amen created everything it was by faith and faith and doubt is in the soul oh my god if you listen to that message he said if God he said of God if you could let God into your soul faint like that he said you become a solar system you know what a solar system it means the Sun sets right in the middle and controls all the planets controls all of that oh come on somebody this soul when he said that I said okay you become a solar system a solar system and I thought about all of those virtues becoming planets mmm circling you like that yeah and that's all got every one of them in control nothing gets out of order because the Sun has a grip on them hallelujah and that's how it is with a true born-again fire baptized man come to recognize what he possessed see that they were trying to keep that from us I believe that we got something here but we're not really utilizing it we're not allowing God a mentor to touch a function in us hallelujah ha the prophet of God said because of those flus those inlets those inlets are plugged up with all kinds of downton filth and you name it we got it all plugged up and so god can't go in and out like he wants to but he said you got to clean it out hallelujah and you and I we know what I hear issues are we must clean it out let God come in and give you a thorough flushing Holly Nia is more than is more than fasting it's more than anything and then when God comes here you know what he is like a love affair he gets everything out and make sure it's perfected is that's okay now if David didn't let nothing unclean come into the city film and that's what people say people don't understand your word I know people who are in this message who are literally miserable not because they never had an experience they did just what John brother John said they believed the message but they never came into the Holy Ghost hmm and just believing the message is gonna make you miserable why cuz you can't live it you know what's right but you can't do it hallelujah but you need a real Holy Ghost experience beyond amen hey you know what it's the truth a lot of times we think oh my god and I was the same way God gave it to me give it to you begging him but it was the wrong kind wrong way I believe in really desperation I really believe in and then prevailing but the travail is lord help me yield help me year Lord let me hear to your Holy Spirit let me yield yield to everything and let me get rid of my thoughts and my desires let me let me die Lord let me yield Lord you see what I'm saying it ain't begging him he's already giving you it again but you he means room in you for the gift you got to make room for him Oh help us Lord that's what David he was able to conquer the city he was able to gain the city Amen because amen the Lord of Hosts was with him and like I said this morning we got the Lord of Hosts with us we've got the mighty angel hallelujah who is Christ himself is that right amen that's why he comes again in Revelation amen coming with his horse with him O Lord to do battle again ah because we fought the battle year we won the better here we gave victory day here we went up there hallelujah and now he brings us back he's not worried and concerned about whether the war would be won hallelujah he knows he's got real experienced soldiers hallelujah who's gone through a real boot training in boot camp and everything else knows the devil before he sees it hallelujah I don't know about that spell but people say like they could smell the devil I never smelled him but I'm sure that's not a pleasant thing but nevertheless you and I must run this town instead is that right he's Beelzebub we don't be other above means Lord of the Flies Lord of the dung yes you see what I'm saying so he can't be smelling too good setting up on the other hand oh god I'm on the dung oh god help us teeth but anyway that's the way God says he is but you know what we a lot of times people don't even know what that means that means he's Lord of hell that's the dung hallelujah they looked unto Him and we're like listen I sought the Lord called the proverbs 30:4 and he heard me and delivered me from all my fear that's what they said fear doesn't harm you as to fear I fear that harms you they look under him and we're lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cry and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles right they talked about Christ but at the same time you can use that this poor man cry blessed is the poor in spirit all right hey and the Lord her and saved him out of all his troubles the age of the Lord in camping around about them that fear Him and delivering them now we've got an angel y'all believe that like I said he's not just here he's here hallelujah hey man and we we though we'd never see we hardly ever see him he's still here he never went that huh and he's here to help you how many times you've been almost in a wreck in the car stop on a dime who you thought or what you thought stop the car you understand me see so many phenomenal things happen around us and we don't even see it but God has always protected us even when we didn't even know he was protecting us and if he protected us when we didn't know it what about now hallelujah future whom he calls the church through justification and calls it through sanctification then feels it with the Holy Ghost and fire and he took it through a process that he himself the Holy Spirit Himself the son of God could dwell in the human heart now it was to go through that before he can't come into it huh let me read that again he brought us through just sanctification then filled us he excuse me he called the church through justification call it through sanctification then filled it with the Holy Ghost and fire and he took it he took it through a process that he himself the Holy Spirit Himself the son of God could dwell in the human heart now it has to go through that before he can come into it huh so you got to go through it you really want a great experience with God you've got to start battling in your mind you got to fight when the devil brings you down to your faith that right when he says you weak you gotta say you're strong is that right when you said you don't have no knowledge I do have knowledge if I don't know the whole books I know that Jesus Christ is Lord hallelujah amen and when it comes to temperance all I got to do is stand still is that right a many patients oh my God all I gotta do is let go and let God is that amen when it comes to Gotham is all I need to do is follow his thoughts is I ride you just gotta let go let God and when the devil talk bad about drunk brother you said but he's a kind man hallelujah he's a sweet live is that right for the man said if you're gonna say anything about your brother make it good huh it's simple but it's by reasoning we fail and God is saying stop your reasoning stop letting the devil talk to you because I'm gonna tell you something if you think the devil gonna stop talking to you while you livin you wrong he ain't gonna stop talking to you - you did hello and then it when you did he can talk all you what he won't do you won't be able to hear but the devil ain't gonna leave you alone you old devil leave me alone definitely gonna leave you alone his commission is to torment you he's a tormentor he's the thing that God allowed to bring in his opposition you know God needed some money to fight with him he's got God used him hallelujah but God had already told you to balance been walked fought in the features you want it ain't your battle stand stealing the Lord will fight your battle he said remember Israel he said he said will you pardon me for a minute he said to go back to Israel do you know what what did they do these 40 years when they made their organizations out there instead of going on through led by the pillar of fire then each of the Lord which was Christ instead of going on through and following him in about ten days they've been in the full promise but you know what they wandered in the wilderness Bible said they come to caters Barnea which was the judgement seat and there when the spies come back and talk about the land they said we can't do it hallelujah I don't know what they're talking about God never told them to conquer the land hallelujah God told him to lay it was already conquered wherever you place your feet is yours why they come back said we can't conquer it they had no business coming back with such a report that lady was already conquered all they had to do is go and that's what those - when cattle said the Laird conquered he's ours man look at all those grapes let's get some of these grains and take them back they could care less about the Giants that was in the land and that's the problem we can't see the promise because of the Giants in the halls every time you're looking at the Giant you're gonna bring back a bad report hmm my Giants hallelujah my god looked down on Giants Catelyn Johnson said we are more than able to do it so they was looking to God's promise not what the concision not what the circumstances was see that's the problem let me go back on this he said listen we are more than able to do it for they was looking to God's promise not what the circumstances was you see that's how we get defeated we're looking at the circumstances hallelujah some of us Amen travelling as Christians for a long time and all we can do is look at circumstances who you know God doesn't call you but you feel that God gonna fail because you in a mess God don't take but a minute to clean you up everybody have their appointed time hallelujah but God can't move until you stop believing that he can do it if you can't believe that God can change you God cannot change you but if you have faith that God can change you to change your situation no matter what it is God can do it God will do it huh is that Alright every astronaut has to be pressurized whoo we don't like that pressure yeah man that pressure a man gets next to us sometimes hallelujah but when you know that you have to go through it it's like when you're in boot camp and they take you to the gas chamber and you know already they gonna take that mask off you're not looking forward to it you know it's gonna be a painful experience something that you've never experienced before but you want to be a soldier so what do you do you go through the pain you go through the gas chamber when the window sergeant said take it off you got to take it off and they just let you stay there just for a moment long enough to get your coffin [Laughter] hallelujah but you have a goal and that goal amen is to be completely a complete soul job you know when it comes to the Word of God you got to realize one thing that when it comes to God a lot of people believe and they don't they fail to see they can't hear God's voice if you ever put it never said it like this when the Pharisees and the Sadducees had come on the scene all they knew was what Moses said and Abraham is our Father so when Jesus came they couldn't hear the voice that told Abraham and Moses what they knew see I'm the same thing that happens here when brother Branham came on the scene he came to introduce Jesus Christ not himself many times he said forget about me you know why I'm saying this because people who read the message and they look right at it and I've seen people say I've had people say to me remember when brother Branham said 700 really he that's what he meant said you know is he gonna be around 700 he just you know kind of backed off with a little bit what did you just make my prophet do you made him a liar and he cannot go against the script he said oh he said I didn't even I wouldn't even know where he said I knew it was 7,000 I don't know why I said 700 but there are people and I could call their names move in a certain movement that really believed that over 700 because he said so well what happens when he called Peter John we move he said you know we follow tradition when we get into a place y'all understand what I'm trying to say that's why they could not believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah because they saw the human part of him and when he said I am my father one they could not see the human part of it and that's what is happening are they and when you say things like this people think you preach that preaching against the Prophet no trying to open our eyes because certain things will you so you walk out here believing that it was 700 instead of 7,000 you have just taken away from the word you see and people you know all you speaking evil about the Prophet that is a devil that got people's eyes blind y'all hear what I'm saying and I didn't say that that came out of my mouth so I believe that was the Lord that said that I would be afraid to even say such a thing but my point is we've got people who are so afraid then they they're not secure they haven't made their own election sure they have they're not sure so they hold to what he says and in what he says it's true but they don't have their own revelation you got to have your own revelation you got to have thus the Holy Ghost in you like he had in him you you can't even be a witness you are powerless charged without the Holy gold and I find out that that's what so many people they just get so carried away amen and they think your blaspheming or saying something even that is a devil that's interpreting those things to your mind one of these mornings gods achieve this astronauts that's climbed to Jesus Christ has been in there by the Holy Ghost filled with this power one of these mornings the whole universe will be screaming and wailing and gnashing of teeth when they see they've missed it when the great Eagle powered by the Holy Ghost and fire began to spread her wings the astronauts would take off into the sky to go to meet the bridegroom and when the bride takes off in the astronaut power of God Almighty who sent Jesus Christ to the earth in the form of the Holy Ghost and has brought the church through these achievements so you understand each level of faith you go up it is an achievement you get it my brothers and sisters get pressurized the pressure won't hurt you when you get on the inside and get pressurized get in Christ and you won't care what the world says they can never hit you anyhow you say see how are you talking about brother Brooks I'm trying to tell us something men it's easy for a man to become an air dollar to your husband is Jesus Christ and don't you ever forget it but even when God had done so many great things for Peter James and John they were like his running partners took him up on the Mount Transfiguration they've heard all kinds of things seeing all kind of things and now they see the glory of God Moses in the lodge and I still want to know how they knew that was Moses in a life how did they know that was Moses and Elijah that was a revelation wasn't it and here they want to build Tabernacles and I find that in the message that's exactly what has happened we are building Tabernacles and every tabernacle is not built unto Jesus Christ there are some tapping out was built for Elijah it's true even though Jesus said right true did he say it he said to brother Branham Easter seal a true Mount Transfiguration experience will only glorify Jesus Christ well that's what he said but when you preach that people almost get offended at that and you know why because when they get offended it's ever did that they have a different spirit can I go on the battle is on we don't battle against our organization we know where they are we better against demons in this thing there are no demons in the message because they have to be born again but they are all around what we teach and the whole purpose is to keep this bride from being rod but they don't understand even the demons don't understand it's the seed power it's the power of the seed that makes us bride it's not by our works it's not by human efforts it's by the Holy Spirit on the inside of us that's what makes us different that's what makes us invincible that's what makes us see things that other people can't see even among our own and then we will be called names and blasphemers and things like that because we love the Lord Jesus like I said when that angel came to me vision dream whatever it was I told him I could only love the Lord Jesus and ever since then things have been happening bad things everywhere it's been a real flood I'm like do what you got to do but I stand on this solid Karelia I stand on this solid rock my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and its righteousness and I dare not trust dare not trust nothing oh holy lino nothing but Jesus name and his righteousness hmm is that what brother Branham stood on a man I was telling somebody I can't hardly wait this in hallelujah will you see I'm gonna see him if I'm dead I'm gonna see him if I'm alive I'm gonna see him why he's my brother the greatest battle ever fought she is going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt oh my between Liberty and bondage you know God sent me here and you know I had to you know I told her uh things down there in Liberty City I said God didn't bring me here and bring you here for me to preach to you something that you already know and what you need to do is see God and not me right if you can see God you'll see my purpose but if you can't see God you'll never see me I'm gonna go contrary to a lot of things you think and believe it is what it is because I got a single ayah brothers my eyes are single hmm there's only one Lord one faith in one baptism and I've gotten in trouble because people try to deify him and do everything else I don't care if you're deify brother branham as long as you defy me - we're in the same family don't make him something amen oh they don't hear those quotes that I hear I don't listen for just oh let me see now I hear things that people just don't hear and if the probably God would come back in this day he probably died well if he see what has happened to what his ministry is supposed to produce hello it's the truth and you usually are all brothers I don't I believe that I really believe that because when he left off the scene even random tabernacle was backsliding it didn't look like it in a dress perhaps but they were backsliding because they didn't love God no more he said you've lost your first love now people get here little old well we've seen that before what was that everything was going cold way back then so where is it now I'll tell you I've traveled and I've seen I tell you what like I was telling the brothers now I've had preachers come back to me who grew up in my ministry and now they say brother books I really see what she was trying to do I said you know what I was trying to do I said I was trying to protect you you know I wasn't never jealous of your ministry or jealous of what you could do but I knew what was out there and I was trying to protect you now you experienced it now you see for yourself amen that and all of that beautiful stuff that they got going out of there you better come back to the Holy Ghost you better come back to being born again huh understand all mysteries Paul said and you don't have charity it profits you nothing hmm God listen what he said he goes on and says listen I'm gonna go back and read this whole thing it's just okay this from the greatest battle ever fought he said the greatest battle ever fought she is going she is going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt or in between Liberty and bondage now he covered the whole thing hmm man because of you whatever batter you gone through is between life and death sickness or health faith or doubt or liberty and bondage and you got to whip him and everyone those areas to be completely free the battle is on shine your Spears soldiers polish up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready amen God Ananse his army America dresses their soldiers in the best that they can have to dress with steel helmets Hartman's armors and whatever they got armored tanks and whatever they go in God dresses his army hallelujah what kind of equipment do we use the spirit of the sword the Word of God amen the Word of God is sharper than two-edged swords Hebrew piercing even to the Sunda the bone even the Merrill of the bone even a discerner have the thought of the mind the Word of God to believe his word that's the way God's armor right that right and John 15 said of your body me and my word abiding you you should ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here it is my father's glory that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples hallelujah as father have loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love hallelujah if you keep my Commandments and ye shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments abide in his love hallelujah you know what it's amazing how we don't have love it's amazing I've said in services Amen with preachers were wrong or said something wrong and I said they're still huh because I recognize them as soldiers of the cross hallelujah I recognize them as an auntie preachers hallelujah and when it comes a men to us and then sometimes somebody say something or do something and we ready to quit I've seen it everywhere everywhere I go you know what it this way when it comes to battling some people don't even know how to walk they have no idea on how to fight and it shows people i'ma tell you something if you don't have word in you let me ask you a question knowing the seven seals having a revelation of the seers when you going through battle which which one of those seals you use for encouragement what gives you strength it's the depths of the word is the word you know where we go we're more than conquerors through Christ who strengthens us huh we go right back to a lot of things Paul said you understand me and when it comes to a personal revelation of God that's why I said when it comes when he becomes real to you he's no longer religion you know we're supposed to sing folks listen and in God he puts up with us because the hour of the day the Holy Spirit is lifting from the earth and that's true y'all know it's true it's difficult to pray it anyway it used to be but you got to pray that right once you get in that channel you alright but getting in the channel sometimes can be quite difficult right amen oh how many of y'all I used too fast all the time now I have to bear God you know we ain't no being God is actually being led by God but there sometimes I just want to fast to feel closer because it does that's what fasting does for me it makes me feel close they seem to shop in my spirit mind right but anyhow when you're fasting it seems like you know who you are you got a purpose right so anyway those kind of things you helps be now but when we look at this thing we say okay God's Word is true it is true but understand Jesus this word we've never seen it before like this but for as he thinketh in his heart so is he these virtues are supposed to be the capstone basically the pyramid the power of God in your heart every thought supposed to be thought according to this hmm you know you got to die you got a rot but every thoughts supposed to have faith virtue dogs whatever it's supposed to be pure the Bible said in these things abide in you according to Peter you'll never be barren never neither will you be unfruitful you will always stand in God and this is an achievement and without love it'll never work because brother Branham said love is the thing that seals all these in you got to be born of God for that love to come in you and seal you up think about the stuff I thought we had a good service this morning but where are the people guarantee you they sitting down eating somewhere huh y'all know we love to eat and that's what they doing watching something they shouldn't watch whatever the case may be the Bible said there are Moses and they rose up to play and that's exactly what happened to a lot of people in the church and you know what kills me sometime they people are coming to you said brother Prince I haven't seen you in a long time you ain't been in a long time and in my mind said you need to come at least on Wednesday you'll see me a little more often but all you do is come on Sundays and you don't see me in the morning comes you know cuz sometimes when I go down there I still come up here Sunday evening I'm talking about growth I'm coming up winning battles when we can't even get over these little petty things these little personal issues you know what what should I'm supposed to do brothers sister what will you do an evening service I hadn't seen you in an evening service and almost since you start coming you know that has a two way of going you know but I don't bother people at least I know where I am but we we don't know how to humble ourselves we feel feel you know I'm gonna tell you all something and like the people who I think now for the faithful Todd pears here but do you think I'm here for your tithing you couldn't pay me enough money to be a pastor my wife and I was talking about that the other day you either call are you insane mister truth and somebody sometimes people that were like I'm giving my little nickel and diming that's going to help brother Bruce it's going to help you if you don't do it you in trouble but we do these things and we said oh I'm maturing maturing we're better I'd even gone through the principles of the word yet you said you have faith and you don't even have faith to give 10% it ain't just here's everywhere thank God for those who are faithful may God richly bless you and multiply you a hundred folks eriously what we need to do is humble ourselves that's what the Bible says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God because if you think you gonna tell god what to do with this program you are absolutely wrong god thing you didn't call God like I said who's gonna be his counselor who came to God in order for God to bring recompense give you more money or something who did that nobody we only love God because He first loved us Yemi and you know how to be so grateful let me tell you something you know I used to friend of mine when we was in high school he you know during the summer you know we used to have those uh summer jobs he got the job as a garbage man and people was laughing at me working with garbage truck then I had more cysts in all of us when the summer was over he had new clothes and all kind of stuff and money yeah he what I'm saying while we was laughing at him he suffered the reproach because he knew the reward so what call me whatever you want to call me I know why I'm here and the purpose I'm here and there is coming everywhere I'll never forget that I thought to myself you know next time I might try to get on that garbage truck myself I never did I just was a milkman you know anyway you look at these people and you you you and back in the day that was good money I don't know how they pay the garbage man now but back in that day that was they made good money while everybody else was laughing at them in Columbia South Carolina the garbage man made good money very good money mm-hmm they wrote them garbage clothes doing they doing work but after work they were yeah you see what it is brown goes on to say in the greatest battle ever thought he said if you come you'll keep their memories and conscience and everything thinking about well I might fail it might not be right he said don't you do that at all the moment you think it's gonna fail the moment you think it's not gonna work you just messed up doubt has destroyed everything and you got to look at something like Abraham did and call those things and be not as though they were I don't know how God is gonna do it all but I know he's doing it why is he doing it because I believe it can be done we're taking the land and in a little while that divine love is going to come and cap everything off and when a dog we will take skyy hallelujah oh we think we know what love is a man brother and his wife said bill you preached it but you have no idea huh you have no idea hmm and brother Brandon said that Holy Ghost has it come down from from heaven it decreased city by the time it gets to us it's just a little little something a little shout of something yeah he said but that's just a little shadow of what's there I told you when I was first baptized with the Holy Ghost I didn't know whether I I was supposed to kill a roach or not I was in love it's the truth oh I'm almost done people see your word is eternal truth and it's for me see he said you throw it throw us out everything and open up the channel and say god your word is eternal truth I love that and it's not for me and excuse me and it it's for me it is for me if the old church fell in the hole well fair yes I can't yet I cannot fail because I've made I'm taking the word there's a battle and that's the thing I'm taking the word I'm gonna hold the word and and when does he say he promised me I don't know Oh Mary said well how could this thing be I don't know how it's gonna be it doesn't make scientific sense but Lord be it unto me according to your word I don't know how our translation is going to take place there are no mathematical equations that's going to bring me into a understanding of how this body that is Lord will be changed to immortality I don't know how we're gonna disappear in the twinkling of an eye but I pray he promised hallelujah images well I don't have the Holy Ghost yet but he promised he said if you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus five you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he promised it hallelujah and you need to hold him to his promise until the change come is that right I think brother Keith gave me what about that era of deliverance amen how the era was scenting and everything else but he didn't strike the arrows I think it was a shoot the number of hours enough he didn't get the victory he only did it three times right when he could have gotten it seven times you could have bring it to a completion the thing is we don't strike it love we don't strike it enough we might pray one time and you don't get rid up our game if you don't get rid up our game you just keep praying amen it's striking that promise and then it took God fulfills it that's how you get it but I don't pray Oh hit it again keep hitting today meant until you see the manifestation of what God promised you ain't gonna be satisfied with singing and showering and jumping that's not why I'm here I'm here for the image of Christ I'm here to see his likeness in me I want to see every one of the versions of Christ and then manifested and reflected through this part about it you said how is gonna be that I don't know how but I keeps backing and it's backing an antagonist amen until God make it manifest I don't know what about everybody else but our problem is a heart condition we all have heart conditions here amen in the heart the soul lives in the heart hmm Emma and you believe him your heart hello this is the same prophet amen people don't get religion in their head by a book knowledge you get religion in the heart but an experience in the heart and the heart will always agree with the Bible but the hair will reason and the Bible says we've got to cast down reasoning you can't go with your mind the devil work in that you got to go with your heart so her mind would tell her not it is not reasonable if these women can do that why can't I talking about these sisters and that's what's happening to sisters right now they're called Christians they have good and standards in the church they're good standing in the community so why can't I I am a Christian like they are and if they can do that then it's reasonable and it's reasonable that I should do it cause I do one of them I don't see they think I see I'm old fogey see I I don't have to do nothing right I'm better than they are see see that's the reason if it'll get you in bad every time no matter what your intellect knowledge tell you don't you believe it if it's contrary to the Word of God take thus said the Lord first they write with that no matter and your soul will always agree with the word hmm like I said God dresses his army with the word right I'm almost done the battle is the Lord and the victory is ours he chose to mine and none of us can get out of it we can just ha I don't want the thoughts in my head I don't want still coming they still gonna come right oh I think I'm gonna sleep it off it's still gonna come they ain't nothin no way you're getting out of it the battle has been set in a ray and you got to take your sword and face it is that right why do you think this message God gave the Prophet the Kings sword and then he gave it to us and he says it takes a strong hand of faith to destroy the enemy hmm not no weak like strong strong hand of faith that means his influence and his power is coming at you in a strong way y'all know what I'm saying y'all know the battles are different they're stronger they're more in the influence the way of reasons he's made sense for the moment you got a step back I heard the song say step back and let God do it that's right every when you step back and let God do it then the word will come because the Bible said he will always bring things to your remembrance amen it is God as the Holy Ghost duty to bring the word to your remembers to fight the battle with who and when we we come to the place to realize that the battles in your mind is not they're not coming to entertain you they come to kill you the starts of Satan it received come to kill you it comes to steal kill and destroy that Stan so losing a little battle during the day is not just a little battle during the day it's a great battle and you must handle every battle as a great battle because every battle you win throughout the day takes you higher bills character bill strain and after a while Amen that devilish shake is his it I don't try there be anger I know I can't get next to him that's right therefore bow break his nose if you can break it I love the Lord and one thing I know and in all that God has done for me nobody can take it from me absolutely nobody and when it comes to this message I have studied it I may not be ingenious to quote it like some people but I know it because I know him have I ever made mistakes I've made mistakes but you'll never find me not correcting the mistakes of me but when it comes to this message see one thing about it we're having the Holy Ghost Godin gonna let you rest until you make things right and what I see spirits I see spirits and by God's grace even this morning I didn't want to look at the people because I felt such a mmm I tell you what there's a lot of people that needs deliverance in this place and you know what people are so proud and religious I believe the message you don't even believe it if you don't live it is that right not hearing acting lets believe when you hear and you act on the word that you've heard right but when you see a person I talking about being weak sometimes sometimes we get weak but when you see a person in persons you know I've been how can I said it it's so many situations I've had more situations in the last few years that I've had in the whole of Iowa Ohio and I want you to understand I see now there are people there are churches everywhere and people do not know Christ I've had people complain about me jumping I've had people clean about complain about me my singing you know you're too emotional and I've seen him crack down on people who blown who went to the same church they went up the yeah cam one time and said where do you go to church he said uh I believe is up there in Ohio I thought so you saying just like brother Brooks and I heard him I said hold up as he he got that he had that before he came to me don't blame that on me he got the Holy Ghost before he got came to me I don't want nobody to have my spirit but you're not gonna accuse me of giving somebody my spirit and me not say nothing I shook him up he got quiet no no no no no no even even at one time I was in South Africa and here I done travel with this this evangelist for years and and these people who I called him the board of bishops a man there in Durban supposed to believe this message but I've got to check with them before I come in there and I told him you idiot you tried to tell me this man wasn't a vengeance he ain't got no home Church and all kinds of stuff like that I said listen he out there doing the work and I said he and I know he goes in places you won't even go he'd go into Zulu land and everything else and tell y'all brothers are ones that conversions and everything else another they were afraid to go in there when they said that I said hold up I said there's a lot of you I said listen I don't know how many preachers young pastors I say you pay for my ticket and you can you can set my itinerary any way you want to I said but if I'm paying for my ticket you can't tell me where to go and where not to go I said but y'all can put y'all can get together buy me a ticket if you want I'm still waiting you know what I'm saying but people look at this and they think I'm weak I'm just so you know no no no I try my best not to say neither to the Holy Ghost telling me to say it but when a man stirred my righteous indignation I think sometime they gets shocked I didn't know he had him in what you're talking about I got Jesus Jesus ain't no wimp hallelujah here bring it right on out of me when I don't even want to say it he'll say it so I'm just saying people of God you know we you know I've done seen so I'm trying my best and I'm a tale like this I'm trusting that when I get there God will never none of you would ever have to have a have a saying that I didn't try to tell you that I didn't pull my heart with it out with the truth and I tried to stay as close to this message as I possibly could there's a time you know I thought Oh Lord how I'm gonna say two things brother Branham say you know he would call them Jezebel's and all that but you see if you're not if you better be under the right anointing just say that and when I say that you if God say say say it but if God don't say it you better not say it that's what I learned and I've learned I've seen people amen take people and whip them and say all kinds of things and they said well brother branham said it but brother Brenda was under the anointing for that moment to say what he said and yes he said the truth but you don't know whether that person in the audience is what need that oh how they can't explain it I just know what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about you love the Lord I don't know why I'm pouring my heart out like this but one thing I know for certain people we are blessed and I hope by God's grace not that I'm somebody I just hope God's grace you feel blessed to have me as a pastor because I feel blessed to have you as a people I brag on you and maybe I shouldn't cuz sometimes I get in trouble for that but at this point you haven't disappointed me and I hope and trust by God's grace I never disappoint you you understand me we we love the Lord you may be seated just for a moment just for a moment justice this is a little business here some of you know and I could have said this early this morning but I just wanted to and for the children's sake I'm not gonna call me it's okay you know who I'm speaking
