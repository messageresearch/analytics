[24:06] [Music]
[24:19] this year um I'll just sing this song
[24:22] God will make this trial a blessing and
[24:24] all me if you can put that on the screen
[24:28] mm-hmm because as the Christian life all
[24:31] of us must go through a trial we must be
[24:34] tested and he takes two mountains to
[24:38] make a valley and that's why Paul said
[24:42] count it all joy when we take ten
[24:44] tempted because he knew that God the
[24:47] reason why God put us in many trials is
[24:50] also we can look around in see the
[24:51] mountains that's around full of
[24:53] blessings and also I just want to sing
[24:55] this song maybe they'll help somebody
[24:59] [Music]
[25:08] [Music]
[25:15] [Music]
[25:20] I've just call me to eval you well like
[25:25] I've never seen before I keep searching
[25:30] for a way out
[25:32] seems like bad logs are on the door oh
[25:37] there must be another sunrise another
[25:41] Sun say that I'll see God will make
[25:45] these trial a blessing that's the law he
[25:50] has God will make these Shriner blessing
[25:58] he sends me to my knees who my tears
[26:04] flow like a river getting him their
[26:08] sweets really there's no need to get me
[26:12] courage there's no need to talk but
[26:18] we'll make these trial a blessing and
[26:22] the whole world to see
[26:25] [Music]

[27:28] just be patient
[27:32] [Music]
[27:38] [Music]
[27:50] [Music]
[28:00] and the whole world will originate I
[28:08] wanted to sing this song I didn't want
[28:10] to sing the last first because I thought
[28:13] that first didn't apply to me because
[28:15] many of us when we go through a trial or
[28:17] a test of God wants us to speak to
[28:20] victory before the victory outcomes so
[28:23] this verse says um now I'm standing on a
[28:26] mountain looking back I can see when I
[28:28] was in the lowest Valley his strong hand
[28:31] was leading me oh it's good to see the
[28:34] sunshine to taste and the sweet victory
[28:38] our God has made this trial a blessing
[28:40] all the grace he gives me and I was like
[28:43] well my trial is not over yet so I can't
[28:45] sing this song but then in the in the
[28:49] chorus she says there is no need to talk
[28:51] defeat so just keep talking to victory
[28:54] God want us to talk to Victor before he
[28:55] happens so I'll sing this last first
[28:59] [Music]
[29:06] I can't see his strong hand was
[29:15] leading me it's good to see the sunshine
[29:21] answers this sweet baby god man-made
[29:27] astride a blessing all the crazy maybe
[29:37] try their blessing though he sends me to
[29:42] my ear though ideas for like the river
[29:48] didn't leave their sweets relieved
[29:51] there's no need to get needs courage

[30:05] whole world

[46:11] [Music]
[46:31] [Music]
[46:36] [Music]
[46:51] [Music]
[46:51] Oh
[47:07] [Music]
[47:20] I thank God for the songs that have been
[47:25] sung that song that I brother eats this
[47:31] Paul saying this morning the old
[47:36] favorite of mine by the tidwell's I used
[47:40] to play that song over and over and over
[47:44] again because I know that every trial
[47:49] I've ever had God has made it a blessing
[47:54] God is faithful
[47:56] and I appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:01] thank God for our sister Naomi took a
[48:04] little courage a lot of courage to get
[48:09] up and sing when you're not expecting
[48:11] her sing and I really appreciate her
[48:14] going forth like that it's a beautiful
[48:17] song all the participants in men I still
[48:21] marvel at our brother Samuel
[48:26] he's a little package but he's got a lot
[48:28] of volume I appreciate that
[48:31] I just appreciate all of you I don't
[48:36] even know what to say but before I get
[48:39] started I want to say something to all
[48:41] of you young people cause right now I'm
[48:45] moving up in age and I'd like to see
[48:50] something happen among you I mean real
[48:55] fire
[48:56] not not the traditional thing that you
[49:00] perhaps have seen but I know when when
[49:03] it comes to the top trial trials were
[49:05] getting ready to face you go to bleed
[49:07] more than just understanding of the
[49:10] message in your head it's got to be in
[49:14] your heart and and you young people that
[49:17] do those of you who are in school you
[49:22] really have battles I know you do and
[49:25] you're gonna need more you said well why
[49:28] are you saying that because even when I
[49:30] was in high school I saw young people
[49:34] who belong to a similar church apostolic
[49:38] at that time we didn't know the message
[49:41] but I saw them cave under pressure and
[49:46] even though I wasn't a Christian I knew
[49:48] that what I was looking at what they
[49:52] were reflecting was not what they were
[49:54] supposed to reflect and I used to feel
[49:57] sorry for him but at the same time they
[49:59] wanted to be like me who was I was a sin
[50:02] at a time and I wanted to be like them
[50:04] so you got to realize there's always
[50:06] somebody watching you and if you're
[50:09] reflecting the right kind of thing they
[50:11] really do want to be like you they may
[50:13] not be able to express it with their
[50:15] words but remember that someday when
[50:19] they get ready to see God they'll
[50:22] remember you because you you're the one
[50:25] that they looked at as being a standard
[50:28] as a Christian you're the ones that they
[50:30] did see living a life that they could
[50:33] not live so when they come to that time
[50:36] and they want to live it I'm telling you
[50:37] right now there's a there's a young man
[50:39] I'm trusting he made it more than one
[50:42] person but when I was in high school I
[50:43] saw him stand for Jesus he'd read his
[50:46] Bible a man during lunch time he didn't
[50:48] care who watched him the young man was a
[50:51] very handsome man he could have gotten
[50:53] any girl in the school and he was to
[50:56] himself studying his word taking the
[50:59] abuse people talking about him because
[51:01] he would dress out in jail
[51:03] but that young man was something I saw
[51:07] and wanted to be and when my time came I
[51:13] remembered him and during my time I
[51:17] thought here it is I have a greater
[51:19] message than what he had he was able to
[51:23] stand under what he stand with what he
[51:25] had the Lord let me stand with what I
[51:27] have now as we stand we no matter how
[51:32] young you are people people are looking
[51:36] and people are thirsty brother Branham
[51:39] said the world is dying for love they're
[51:44] dying for it everybody want to love
[51:45] everybody won't love and the Christians
[51:48] are the people who's supposed to be
[51:50] packaged
[51:51] let's turn by God's grace I've got so
[51:54] much to say and I wanted to do so much I
[51:56] don't want to over over bear or be
[52:00] overbearing today but so many things
[52:04] were said even in the songs that goes
[52:07] along with the message that I will have
[52:09] preached today acts 11 please acts 11
[52:19] thank God for all of you who have come
[52:21] up from Iowa City it's a real blessing
[52:24] to me that you did come I just I just
[52:30] know what I've seen and I know what
[52:33] could what can happen I know I see I see
[52:37] a group of young people that I know and
[52:40] believe that God will not set a fire and
[52:42] I know he'll do it if you'll allow him
[52:45] to sometimes it's not when you want it
[52:49] it just comes when he has already
[52:51] designated but just like the prophet of
[52:54] God said if there's a deep call there's
[52:55] a deep to respond you just got to wait
[52:58] keep calling he will respond
[53:02] acts 11:19
[53:09] now they which were scattered abroad
[53:11] upon the person upon the persecution
[53:15] that arose about Stephen traveled as far
[53:18] as Phoenicia and cyprus and antioch
[53:22] preaching the word to none but unto the
[53:25] jews only and some of them were men of
[53:28] cyprus and cyrene II which when they
[53:31] were come to Antioch spake unto the
[53:34] Grecians preaching the Lord Jesus and
[53:37] the hand of the Lord was with them and a
[53:41] great number believed and turned unto
[53:45] the Lord then tidings of these things
[53:48] came unto the ears of the church which
[53:51] was in Jerusalem and they sent to sent
[53:55] forth barnabas that he that he should go
[53:58] as far as any other who then when he
[54:02] came and had seen the grace of God was
[54:05] glad and exhorted them all that they
[54:07] were with purpose of heart they would
[54:09] scream unto the Lord out that that's
[54:13] what I'm saying
[54:13] that love thought purpose of hard that
[54:15] they would cleave unto the Lord for he
[54:19] was a good man and he was full of the
[54:21] Holy Ghost and a faith and much people
[54:23] were added unto the Lord
[54:26] let us pray father we thank you for your
[54:30] grace and your mercy
[54:33] we thank you for being so good to us we
[54:37] thank you for being real so real and our
[54:42] soul you changed this man from what he
[54:45] was to what he is now and father you're
[54:48] still changing us from glory to glory we
[54:51] pray that you would bless this message
[54:54] in a special way and your lovely name
[54:57] Jesus Christ we pray you may be seated
[55:08] because we have a various range of Ages
[55:12] here this morning I may be acting a
[55:16] little different at times but my point
[55:19] is that I want everybody to enjoy the
[55:21] world okay
[55:29] my subject this morning would be a
[55:31] Christian is a believer right so the
[55:38] strength of a Christian
[55:41] it's what's inside of him
[55:45] the strength of a Christian
[55:48] is what's inside of him or the thing
[55:51] that is inside of him
[55:57] just quoting here for a moment so you
[56:01] understand where I'm going
[56:03] the Prophet said a sheep is not asked to
[56:06] bear war he's not asked to manufacture
[56:09] some world this year if he's a sheep
[56:12] he'll have wool because he's a sheep he
[56:16] don't have to say well I'm believing I'm
[56:19] a sheep so I believe better get hurry up
[56:22] around here I got to get some wool for
[56:25] the master he don't have to worry about
[56:27] that as long as he's a sheep he a bear
[56:31] would you don't have to manufacture it
[56:34] now you don't have to manufacture sell a
[56:38] coyote and I've got to have some I
[56:41] should do this and I know I'm a
[56:44] Christian old brother trying to save
[56:45] itself by itself by its own human
[56:49] efforts yet sincere and that's what
[56:52] happened to a lot of Christians or
[56:54] people who have not come to the place
[56:55] where they're born again they try to
[56:57] bear wool when they haven't been born a
[57:00] sheep yet a sheep is it is what it is it
[57:05] doesn't have to go to school to learn to
[57:07] be one it is what it is and we know
[57:09] sheep doesn't manufacture a bear wool it
[57:13] comes from the inside out
[57:15] what's the matter is wheat pulpits weak
[57:20] schools weak seminaries that's the
[57:24] matter teaching man's theology you see
[57:27] today the strength of a Christian you
[57:29] see are your Christian oh I'm a
[57:31] Methodist or you're Christian or I'm a
[57:33] Baptist you know are you're Christian oh
[57:36] I'm I'm in the message all right as if
[57:40] that has anything to do with you being a
[57:43] Christian you must know Jesus for
[57:45] yourself how different hallelujah how
[57:48] different from the first church they had
[57:51] goal of these things to say but they had
[57:53] been filled with an energy I like that
[57:57] word energy
[57:58] I like to see people with energy because
[58:03] in this day it seemed like everybody's
[58:04] tired but I love to see people with
[58:08] energy because they have something to
[58:12] offer and if you tired and somebody's
[58:15] has energy you're gonna either get
[58:17] energy are you to get out of the
[58:18] presence of that energy they have energy
[58:24] a power of the Holy Ghost that has set
[58:28] them free from sin and death and they
[58:31] wasn't normal it wasn't normal nominal
[58:35] excuse me they had a love of God burning
[58:39] in their hearts that sent them to death
[58:43] y'all know what I'm saying
[58:45] see when I read these things it's what I
[58:50] crave for you know what I hear the word
[58:55] of God and I see it I measure myself by
[58:58] that word and I said God that's where I
[59:00] want to be
[59:04] I want to be that that that original it
[59:07] ought to be a copy I want to be the
[59:10] original whatever they had is what I
[59:14] want I'm not gonna stop until I get it
[59:17] all right I'm not a social drinker so
[59:23] you understand what I mean I like
[59:26] getting drunk in the Lord and a
[59:32] Christian he's a believer you know it is
[59:36] you take this Bible and the message how
[59:38] you want to place it and you say I
[59:40] believe it all now let me ask you a
[59:44] question do you understand all of this
[59:46] be honest no but you believe it all and
[59:51] you believe that all of this is God's
[59:53] Word and you believe that whatever God
[59:56] has said there's no error in this Bible
[1:00:02] God has made himself he's manifested it
[1:00:05] I was talking about somebody the other
[1:00:08] day and they said well you know the
[1:00:11] property of God said that Enoch Noah saw
[1:00:15] Enoch translate and I'm saying this to
[1:00:18] the young people so you understand that
[1:00:20] according to the chronology you know the
[1:00:23] time of living knowing Enoch live in a
[1:00:25] different time so how did Noah see you
[1:00:27] Enoch leave and the Lord I asked God let
[1:00:30] me tell you something when you don't you
[1:00:31] have a question about this Bible you
[1:00:33] asked the Lord and God will always give
[1:00:37] you an answer because somebody is gonna
[1:00:39] come in question you own that right you
[1:00:42] know what the Lord told me he said Noah
[1:00:45] was a prophet and so he did see Enoch is
[1:00:49] that right then he took me to the Bible
[1:00:51] and he said my Moses how are you gonna
[1:00:53] believe this Moses wasn't at the
[1:00:55] creation but Moses wrote at all
[1:01:00] hallelujah you see what I'm saying
[1:01:02] people with their ridiculous questions
[1:01:04] all you gotta do is ask God when you
[1:01:06] ever have a question about the word in
[1:01:09] the message ask God and he'll give you
[1:01:11] the answer why because it comes by
[1:01:14] revelation he put things in the Bible to
[1:01:18] stumble those who are so intellectual
[1:01:21] walk reasoning we don't reason the word
[1:01:25] we believe the word the strength of the
[1:01:28] Christian is having confidence in God
[1:01:31] and God is the word Yanis 10 as long as
[1:01:36] you stay on the word hallelujah you
[1:01:40] don't have to worry about failure right
[1:01:43] a Christian according to dictionary or
[1:01:49] whatever says it is a person who
[1:01:51] exemplifies in his or hers life the
[1:01:54] teaching of Christ right he died he died
[1:01:59] in other words he'd used an expression
[1:02:00] he died like a true Christian and we
[1:02:03] remember but remember now the Bible
[1:02:06] tells us and I didn't continue that
[1:02:08] Scripture but I would go head-on in acts
[1:02:10] 2 2050 with only says then departed but
[1:02:14] Barnabas to Tarsus to seat song and when
[1:02:17] he had found him he brought him onto an
[1:02:19] ark and it came to pass that a whole
[1:02:22] year they assembled themselves with the
[1:02:25] church and taught much people and the
[1:02:28] disciples were called Christians first
[1:02:30] in Antioch and understand they were
[1:02:34] called Christians because they walk like
[1:02:36] him they talk like him they lived like
[1:02:38] him and the miracles followed them see
[1:02:41] you said I am a believer
[1:02:43] the Bible says miracles signs and
[1:02:46] wonders shall follow the believer
[1:02:50] hallelujah so you know when you see
[1:02:52] these things you got to understand that
[1:02:54] as a Christian
[1:02:55] somebody's gonna confront you and
[1:02:58] they're gonna ask you all you say you're
[1:03:00] a Christian what make you a Christian
[1:03:02] right
[1:03:03] you think you better and that's what
[1:03:05] they say you think you better than
[1:03:06] everybody else right now those things
[1:03:10] the Bible says those who live godly in
[1:03:14] Jesus will suffer persecution so you
[1:03:18] can't get around that because God is
[1:03:20] gonna put you in a into what we call a
[1:03:23] confrontation you're going to be
[1:03:25] challenged right you're going to be
[1:03:29] challenged and you know you say well
[1:03:31] brother books what do you mean yes God
[1:03:34] loves those opportunities to prove
[1:03:39] himself not only to you but to the to
[1:03:41] thee to the non-believer right so you
[1:03:44] got to realize by God's grace when it
[1:03:47] comes to being a real Christian
[1:03:49] it is what's in you now if you don't put
[1:03:55] nothing in you there's nothing that will
[1:03:57] come out everybody so when the squeeze
[1:04:00] come well when the squeeze come if you
[1:04:02] if there's nothing in you when you
[1:04:05] squeeze nothing's gonna come out it's
[1:04:08] like an orange that deceives you you
[1:04:11] ever had one of those sweet-smelling
[1:04:14] nice-looking orange you squeeze if you
[1:04:16] can't get no juice out of it you know
[1:04:19] anyway that's how some Christians are
[1:04:22] but nevertheless the Bible tells us in
[1:04:26] Philippians 120 and 2930 says for unto
[1:04:30] you it is given in the behalf of Christ
[1:04:33] not only to believe on him but also to
[1:04:37] suffer for his sake she being a
[1:04:40] Christian doesn't mean it's a flowery
[1:04:43] babies everything lovely and wonderful
[1:04:45] no suffering comes with being a
[1:04:49] Christian now the truth of the matters
[1:04:52] are oh this one is a Christian this one
[1:04:54] is a Christian this one is a Christian
[1:04:55] but if you live knowing that you have
[1:04:58] the truth if you live according to the
[1:05:00] Word of God that God has given us a
[1:05:02] corner Malikov you're going to be
[1:05:05] persecuted from we're Christians
[1:05:09] those who call themselves Christians
[1:05:12] they are going to persecute you and you
[1:05:15] must have a ready answer
[1:05:18] you must have something to give back
[1:05:21] other than words there must be a light
[1:05:24] behind what you're speaking is that
[1:05:28] right
[1:05:29] because really let's let's just for an
[1:05:31] example Daniel Daniel not only did he
[1:05:37] and this is what makes me happy this is
[1:05:40] I understand Daniel little bit now I'm
[1:05:42] not a prophet but I like the idea
[1:05:44] because Daniel was a man that stood
[1:05:46] alone though Shadrach Meshach and
[1:05:49] Abednego was there somehow you never see
[1:05:53] them in the same church meetings somehow
[1:05:56] they were always separated and Daniel
[1:05:59] had to pray he had a prayer meeting and
[1:06:02] nobody showed up but Daniel but did he
[1:06:06] stop Oh ain't nobody coming so I might
[1:06:08] as well stop praying uh uh Daniel prayed
[1:06:10] anyhow you see what I'm saying
[1:06:13] he has stamina he had energy he had
[1:06:17] something on the inside of him that made
[1:06:20] him live amen y'all know what I'm saying
[1:06:24] he was not ashamed like Paul said of
[1:06:27] this gospel Paul said I'm not ashamed of
[1:06:30] the gospel of Christ it is the power of
[1:06:32] God unto salvation hallelujah
[1:06:36] having the same conflicts which he saw
[1:06:39] in me and now he now here's to be in me
[1:06:43] now you got to understand Paul says I've
[1:06:44] gone through everything never was I've
[1:06:46] been shipwrecked I've been beaten I've
[1:06:48] been there three times raised up and
[1:06:51] everything else that process and I get
[1:06:52] up and I still glorify God how did we go
[1:06:57] through these little light affliction
[1:06:58] huh they sent the wrong thing to me oh
[1:07:01] you know what I mean these are light
[1:07:02] afflictions we can't be so we just so
[1:07:05] soft jelly
[1:07:11] may God have mercy we need some backbone
[1:07:14] folks
[1:07:18] oh my you got to understand these
[1:07:22] Christians were talking about y'all Noah
[1:07:24] corn is a corn if it's a real high power
[1:07:27] real thoroughbred corn you know what I
[1:07:29] mean it's real right
[1:07:31] anything that real is ugly it's the
[1:07:38] truth everything's happen is beautiful
[1:07:40] is that right think about it you go and
[1:07:43] you see your orange and it's orange in
[1:07:45] it that's not a real orange it just
[1:07:48] looked like one seedless oranges y'all
[1:07:51] know we like those but that's not real
[1:07:53] it's hybrid it's true and and and the
[1:08:00] scientist has designed it so well it's
[1:08:02] so beautiful oh and y'all know we like
[1:08:04] the seedless grapes come on somebody
[1:08:08] it's beautiful it's sweet it's tasty but
[1:08:11] it will not give you life its man's
[1:08:15] system that has made it look like that
[1:08:18] but life has a different way of
[1:08:21] expressing itself is that right
[1:08:24] but a man who even tells us he said you
[1:08:26] know a thoroughbred plant don't need to
[1:08:28] be watered all the time and when you get
[1:08:31] a person and they've got to be watered
[1:08:33] all the time and encourage all the time
[1:08:35] and come on come on come on eventually
[1:08:37] when you stop encouraging them they're
[1:08:39] gonna stop
[1:08:42] so you got to realize as a Christian you
[1:08:45] have to learn how to be strong even in
[1:08:47] times of adversities when there's no one
[1:08:50] else around that's when you stand that's
[1:08:54] when God is working with you right
[1:08:56] because he want to see how you stand on
[1:08:59] the pressure by yourself is that right
[1:09:03] Paul had to do it
[1:09:05] Paul said listen he was the greatest a
[1:09:07] messenger of his agent you know he did a
[1:09:11] lot of witnessing he he opened up a lot
[1:09:13] of churches and and everything else and
[1:09:15] at the end of the day Paul says I'm
[1:09:18] standing alone God even took my best
[1:09:21] friend Dimas one of my best friends and
[1:09:25] now Dimas is gone and now all of the
[1:09:27] preachers are standing against me where
[1:09:29] are all these churches that I once had
[1:09:32] he says I'm by myself he's able to know
[1:09:37] what
[1:09:39] I fought a good fight and I kept the
[1:09:43] same
[1:09:44] and we've got the fight folks you can't
[1:09:47] give up it's too late to give up it's
[1:09:50] too late to be distracted you know all
[1:09:52] these things that's flowing around the
[1:09:53] message keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:09:56] don't let these things all they're doing
[1:09:58] this and they doing that that has
[1:09:59] nothing to do with you
[1:10:01] this is an individual walk keep your
[1:10:03] eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:10:08] let God be able to bring some rule out
[1:10:11] of you you know what I'm saying so you
[1:10:15] realize by God's grace Christians who
[1:10:18] were or not they were you know it's like
[1:10:20] this they were afraid sometimes people
[1:10:22] are afraid to stand for the truth and
[1:10:24] I'm giving you to give you an example in
[1:10:25] the word in Galatians 6 chapter 11
[1:10:29] through 15 of this okay I'm not gonna be
[1:10:31] long you see how Lord you said ye see
[1:10:35] how large a letter I have written unto
[1:10:37] you with my own hand this is Paul
[1:10:39] writing to the Galatians as many as
[1:10:42] desire to make a fair show in the flesh
[1:10:45] they constrain you to be circumcised
[1:10:48] only lest they should suffer persecution
[1:10:51] for the cross of Christ you see what I'm
[1:10:54] saying there's a Jewish law that every
[1:10:57] man child at eight they had to be
[1:10:59] circumcised and when the Gentiles came
[1:11:03] in they were circumcised and they
[1:11:06] weren't being commanded to circumcise
[1:11:08] and so the Jewish people had men tried
[1:11:11] to put this law on the on the Gentiles
[1:11:14] that they need to be circumcised and
[1:11:17] that they knew the truth because Paul
[1:11:19] would not have been rebuking them in
[1:11:21] this situation he said no you're doing
[1:11:24] this and it's only because you want to
[1:11:26] look good in the eyes of the people but
[1:11:28] we know that's right Paul said the
[1:11:31] Galatians have got heaven who will be
[1:11:33] with you that you would go back to the
[1:11:35] law when the law all it did was present
[1:11:38] death to you you couldn't do it you
[1:11:40] couldn't live it yourself and now you're
[1:11:42] trying to make the Gentiles he said you
[1:11:45] are busy you have been bewitched right
[1:11:48] in other words when you go backwards
[1:11:50] when you know to go forward you have
[1:11:52] been bewitched
[1:11:54] and it goes on and he says now but god
[1:11:57] forbid that I should glory right save in
[1:12:02] the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:12:07] is Paul being Jew to the first church he
[1:12:10] said I'm not glory in nothing but in the
[1:12:14] Lord Jesus Christ but whom the world is
[1:12:17] crucified unto me and I unto the world
[1:12:21] for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
[1:12:23] availeth anything nor uncircumcision
[1:12:27] y'all gonna hear what I'm sayin your
[1:12:31] morals mean nothing but a new creature
[1:12:36] because there's a lot of people in the
[1:12:38] world who don't steal smoke lie or cheat
[1:12:41] but you must be born again
[1:12:43] you must become a new creature in Christ
[1:12:47] and this is what I'm trying to get over
[1:12:49] to the people do you realize the
[1:12:51] millions of people who follow the
[1:12:52] message of Moses and yet they never got
[1:12:54] the new spirit only two out of that
[1:12:59] generation and that's what scares me
[1:13:02] that's what troubles me that's what
[1:13:05] makes me sigh and cry because I realized
[1:13:09] there's so many people who are resting
[1:13:12] upon their religion like the Sadducees
[1:13:14] and the fantasy Pharisees did and when
[1:13:18] Jesus came he said you all all y'all
[1:13:20] dead young it looks out on sometime I
[1:13:24] feel like I'm selling rough and I don't
[1:13:27] mean to but I do care about souls you do
[1:13:33] not those of us who understand and know
[1:13:36] you do not want to die amen without the
[1:13:40] blood covering you you want the blood
[1:13:43] covering you
[1:13:45] now dreams are dreams years ago I had a
[1:13:49] dream and this person was talking to me
[1:13:51] and in this dream he took me to the
[1:13:53] three levels of Hell and one level of
[1:13:56] Hell I saw children I said God children
[1:13:58] just yes we're not their children in
[1:14:02] North Day we're not their children in
[1:14:05] Sodom day you understand me
[1:14:08] whether or not their children in Egypt
[1:14:11] right so you said well what about a
[1:14:14] child coming to know when a child comes
[1:14:16] to understand good and evil that's when
[1:14:21] God will hold him accountable
[1:14:23] it used to be 12 but nowadays these kids
[1:14:28] know stuff without mercy
[1:14:35] and you and I must understand Amen that
[1:14:38] we know that the blood has saved
[1:14:40] everyone that has been predestinated to
[1:14:43] be safe now look at this because I want
[1:14:48] you to understand and I caught this by
[1:14:51] listening to the message but anyway you
[1:14:53] know we we find out listen he says you
[1:14:56] know every time something is going good
[1:14:59] Satan always brings something to mess it
[1:15:02] up right you can have a church and his
[1:15:06] own fire for God I'm telling you this
[1:15:08] because when God starts to fire and he
[1:15:11] will he's going to bring it because I'm
[1:15:13] praying I'm believing and I'm expecting
[1:15:16] right and when God starts something and
[1:15:20] it goes good guess what the devil always
[1:15:23] bring somebody in to mess it up
[1:15:31] but the Branham called it sheep stealing
[1:15:34] dogs I'm like yeah hey it's the truth
[1:15:44] sheep stealing dogs and we got a lot of
[1:15:46] around here I said around here I mean
[1:15:49] the message people who will let you work
[1:15:53] they my first my first split in my
[1:15:55] church in in in Ohio which came from
[1:15:58] befriending another brother from another
[1:16:00] I guess a segment of the message and he
[1:16:07] took all my babies all my little babies
[1:16:11] I just warned to the Lord preaching on
[1:16:16] the streets and everything else he took
[1:16:17] my right they never recovered
[1:16:24] even though God gave me a dream of their
[1:16:26] destruction I tried to warn them they
[1:16:28] went on anyway but you see what I'm
[1:16:30] saying when it was going good that's
[1:16:34] when the devil came in so I'm saying
[1:16:37] when it started going good brothers if
[1:16:40] I'm still here by God's grace that I
[1:16:42] mean he's alive if I start preaching
[1:16:44] hard on about the sheep stealing dogs
[1:16:46] you know when I'm talking you understand
[1:16:49] me so let's move on see the devil that's
[1:16:52] the way the devil will do it right but
[1:16:55] it takes stamina right it takes a man of
[1:16:57] God or saint of God to actually see the
[1:17:00] enemy approaching and stop him right
[1:17:08] God is faithful
[1:17:11] you must realize what is your
[1:17:13] inheritance and you must protect each
[1:17:17] other you understand me all of us in
[1:17:21] here which should protect each other
[1:17:23] we should never discuss or speak evil or
[1:17:28] try to down one another even though we
[1:17:30] may not may not agree with things we
[1:17:33] should always be positive each other try
[1:17:37] to unify listen you got to fight this
[1:17:39] what Paul said fight - can you got to
[1:17:42] contend for the faith you're the fight
[1:17:46] and it's important that you have this in
[1:17:50] you is a strength because sometimes
[1:17:52] people can run somebody down and it
[1:17:54] takes a strength for you to stand
[1:17:55] against them y'all know what I'm saying
[1:17:58] it takes us because sometimes this
[1:18:01] person may not maybe you know a relative
[1:18:04] or a great friend or something and and
[1:18:07] and and it takes strength to say hold up
[1:18:09] you don't need to be saying those things
[1:18:12] do anybody know what I'm talking about
[1:18:14] that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:18:16] that's the way it should be because
[1:18:18] those are those are things that we allow
[1:18:20] to infiltrate it deplete displeases the
[1:18:23] Holy Ghost it grieves him because only
[1:18:27] one thing that that blesses God is that
[1:18:30] when we are on one Accord
[1:18:35] now let me hurry up on this I love this
[1:18:40] one thing I love about is you know sham
[1:18:43] God and many of us don't I mean we know
[1:18:46] about him but sham God to me he
[1:18:49] represents that old Christian that you
[1:18:52] know he was just timid and you know I
[1:18:57] thought I knew what that word timid
[1:18:59] meant but it means lacking in self
[1:19:03] assurance lacking and courage or bravery
[1:19:10] easily alarmed shy you see them saying
[1:19:17] you know sometimes when it comes to God
[1:19:19] we're not supposed to be timid you'll
[1:19:22] never see a soldier warrior timid he's a
[1:19:27] fighter
[1:19:28] and he knows he's a fighter he knows
[1:19:31] what he's packing and you and I supposed
[1:19:34] to know what we're packing the devil
[1:19:36] listen when safety comes and say this is
[1:19:39] what's going to happen you're supposed
[1:19:40] to call him down and says you are liar
[1:19:43] when you just be people speaking to
[1:19:46] curse you or say something negative
[1:19:48] about who you are and what you're going
[1:19:51] to become you're supposed to stop that
[1:19:53] because you realize that's not God
[1:19:56] talking that's the devil you know young
[1:20:01] people I'm gonna tell you something you
[1:20:02] can make straight A's and school if you
[1:20:03] want to don't you ever let those
[1:20:05] teachers tell you what you cannot
[1:20:07] accomplish when God said all things are
[1:20:11] possible
[1:20:12] that means if I want to a I can get one
[1:20:16] whatever I want I can get it
[1:20:23] even my son who who gave rededicated his
[1:20:26] life two years ago and he's been trying
[1:20:29] to live just as close to God as he can
[1:20:30] and you know he called me today this
[1:20:33] morning even telling me how God has
[1:20:34] changed in him and stuff
[1:20:36] for the good he thinking something's
[1:20:38] wrong with him but God is cleaning him
[1:20:40] up but the thing that he was telling me
[1:20:44] is that that that that these people are
[1:20:47] discussing or making him the head
[1:20:50] security person over that whole company
[1:20:54] Netflix yeah he just got that news he
[1:20:59] says you are you serious he would be in
[1:21:03] charge of everybody over that and you
[1:21:07] know he's been keeping himself he's you
[1:21:10] know saying in opposition in the under
[1:21:13] the pressure he said daddy I'm so
[1:21:15] different he said I am so different
[1:21:17] around uh uh all these people I said you
[1:21:19] know God made you that way but you know

[1:21:54] be honest with you if all y'all would
[1:21:57] want to jump me with the stick and I'm
[1:21:59] anointed by God you're in trouble
[1:22:04] because somewhere somehow the skills
[1:22:07] will come from and that's the way it was
[1:22:13] when sham God Amen he didn't know how to
[1:22:16] fight he didn't go train he didn't take
[1:22:17] you gypsy he didn't take karate he knew
[1:22:20] nothing about warfare but he got angry
[1:22:23] he got mad at the devil and sometimes we
[1:22:27] need to get mad at him right don't act
[1:22:30] like the devil your friend he's not your
[1:22:32] friend the Bible said he comes to steal
[1:22:34] kill and destroy hallelujah and the
[1:22:39] devil to make you split up with your
[1:22:40] best friend over junk sometimes when
[1:22:46] people say things to you it is good not
[1:22:48] to even respond that's the truth follow
[1:22:53] peace with all men holiness without no
[1:22:56] man should see the Lord share God said I
[1:22:59] am so tired how many y'all have had it
[1:23:03] will seem like the devil just all in
[1:23:05] your pocketbook no matter what you to
[1:23:10] you can't save you can't keep no money
[1:23:13] there like he's all and you don't even
[1:23:14] know where it disappeared to somewhere
[1:23:18] you need to get tired especially if you
[1:23:22] paying your tithing God said if you pay
[1:23:25] your tithe you open up a window where
[1:23:27] you wouldn't have ruler somewhere Amen
[1:23:29] those Philistines is in there every time
[1:23:33] you think you got a good chunk he comes
[1:23:37] yo know the truth a car break down
[1:23:40] something happens right and you need to
[1:23:43] get mad at it don't just think over will
[1:23:44] this is going to happen no you are in a
[1:23:48] warfare understand Satan is working
[1:23:51] against you
[1:23:52] - what to diminish or deplete your faith
[1:23:57] hallelujah
[1:23:58] to make you lose confidence in God you
[1:24:03] gotta put a stop to it you like that guy
[1:24:05] brother said that song you know he can't
[1:24:07] speak negative I don't care what Valley
[1:24:09] we in we got to speak positive right
[1:24:12] we've got to say Amen like Abraham call
[1:24:15] those things that be not as though they
[1:24:17] were become Abraham 25 years knew he was
[1:24:22] going to have a baby but it didn't come
[1:24:24] until 25 years he never changed his tune
[1:24:28] no matter what he went through he kept
[1:24:31] going with it that's the strength of a
[1:24:33] Christian it's what's in you see if it's
[1:24:37] just in your head it's not gonna work it
[1:24:39] has to be in your heart right in your
[1:24:41] heart and when people come up negative
[1:24:44] and tell you all these kind of things it
[1:24:46] what good is that how many times you've
[1:24:50] seen the weatherman say it's gonna rain
[1:24:51] or snow and it never does you know I
[1:24:54] call them false prophets
[1:24:58] right so you gotta understand Shamgar
[1:25:02] desi listen he only had was a weather
[1:25:04] was a little law of the goat call it
[1:25:09] arctic oh yeah with a little stick with
[1:25:12] the metal piece on it right and and you
[1:25:16] know the kind when the ox don't want to
[1:25:17] go you hit him with that thing it had a
[1:25:20] little sharp part on the end right and
[1:25:23] it made him go sometime God has to use
[1:25:27] the flipping those thing they get us
[1:25:29] moving forward but at the same time you
[1:25:35] must understand he used that same
[1:25:37] instrument and he whooped those
[1:25:40] Philistines and he killed 600 Oulu yeah
[1:25:46] I just wonder sometimes you know you
[1:25:48] want to go back and see how it's all
[1:25:49] happening right you want to see how
[1:25:51] minutes ha
[1:25:52] oh I he stacked him through you know -
[1:25:54] by 200 by 200 or 100 but he just by the
[1:26:00] time he's finished I can see his wife
[1:26:02] back you don't have said she was in
[1:26:06] shock
[1:26:07] he was just man who's probably never
[1:26:09] raised his voice you know never show any
[1:26:12] kind of frustration I don't know but
[1:26:15] there was a new man she saw hallelujah
[1:26:19] yeah that's a real story that's a real
[1:26:23] situation
[1:26:24] Halon to look at and to see how God did
[1:26:29] what he did
[1:26:33] and if God can do it for gem god he can
[1:26:36] do it for you this is what we must
[1:26:38] understand this book is for you it's for
[1:26:41] us that we gain faith and trust in God
[1:26:44] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:46] forever he's a God that changed now we
[1:26:49] can't allow our minds to cheat us from
[1:26:54] this reality Lord if it ain't in my
[1:26:57] heart put it in my heart put it in my
[1:27:00] heart so I can speak this thing and
[1:27:02] believe when I'm speaking right Paul was
[1:27:06] a man of God was a mighty man of God
[1:27:09] under persecution and I I love the way
[1:27:11] Paul would do things he really stood as
[1:27:15] a Christian a man and you got to
[1:27:18] understand this man was a very
[1:27:19] intellectual man and he said that listen
[1:27:22] I get rid of all of this that I might
[1:27:24] gain Christ and you and I must
[1:27:26] understand in order for us to see this
[1:27:29] message the way it's supposed to be seen
[1:27:32] you got to get rid of everything is that
[1:27:35] right remember when the Prophet God he
[1:27:37] tells of a story about this man who
[1:27:39] painted a pitch of Christ and our statue
[1:27:41] of Christ and and when he made the
[1:27:43] statue of Christ as one man observed and
[1:27:46] he was disappointed because he had heard
[1:27:48] so many things about this particular
[1:27:49] statue and he was so discouraged about
[1:27:52] it he until the one man who was who was
[1:27:55] mining or keeping everything up he's
[1:27:57] assert he said you'll never see the
[1:27:59] reality of what this picture is all
[1:28:01] about until you get down on your knees
[1:28:03] see that's what I'm saying
[1:28:05] young people you'll never see Jesus -
[1:28:08] you humble yourself do you be able to
[1:28:11] get down on your knees and not be
[1:28:12] ashamed of Christ and when he got down
[1:28:17] on his knees he hit was that the image
[1:28:19] that he was looking at was breathtaking
[1:28:21] breathtaking
[1:28:23] right because he's never seen Christ he
[1:28:27] never seen Jesus like that and until
[1:28:30] this message becomes breathtaking until
[1:28:33] you see Jesus in that way you still too
[1:28:36] high you got to come down this is why I
[1:28:39] said tell people I say you know I know
[1:28:41] people I doesn't matter what they think
[1:28:45] but
[1:28:45] my point is until we get to a place
[1:28:50] where we forget about the great ones and
[1:28:54] see the great one
[1:28:58] we're not going nowhere you think that
[1:29:02] Jesus is Jesus a he's waiting on us but
[1:29:06] everything has to come back to his
[1:29:08] proper order in order for him to take a
[1:29:10] bride that's why it's gonna be a few I
[1:29:13] know it's just like oh so many people in
[1:29:16] the message know they might be in the
[1:29:18] message but how many the message is in
[1:29:21] how many are this message is in that's
[1:29:24] the way he said it he said you ought to
[1:29:25] say the message is in me and not that
[1:29:27] I'm in the message the pall under
[1:29:31] pressure let me hurry up all under
[1:29:32] pressure when he came before Agrippa and
[1:29:36] then I like to grip the word grip
[1:29:37] Agrippa grip I looked at word up it
[1:29:39] means one who causes great pain at birth
[1:29:43] so I thought about that I said you got
[1:29:46] to understand that Paul was continually
[1:29:49] growing into perfection coming into his
[1:29:54] ministry constantly moving forward so
[1:29:57] there were things he had to be birthed
[1:29:59] into and sometimes when you go through
[1:30:02] chain trials God is birthing you into a
[1:30:04] virtue it's painful but you can't say oh
[1:30:09] I'm just oh you know Christians you have
[1:30:12] a lot of stormy days right it's the
[1:30:17] truth you go shuffle friction you gonna
[1:30:21] suffer you're gonna go through but my
[1:30:23] point is if you're gonna suffer
[1:30:24] suffering for Jesus suffer because
[1:30:27] always you know if you're gonna get
[1:30:30] fired you get fired for being too holy
[1:30:35] when they don't want you around cuz you
[1:30:37] ain't you ain't immoral
[1:30:39] then that that's a real testimony but a
[1:30:42] grip of Paul says listen and I thought
[1:30:44] this is why God used that very name of
[1:30:46] gripper because Paul under that birth he
[1:30:49] said listen King I want to tell you my
[1:30:52] story this is what I love about it see
[1:30:54] when people challenge you they said well
[1:30:56] how do you know you a Christian give
[1:30:58] them a testimony let them know where you
[1:31:01] came from where you were and where you
[1:31:04] are now
[1:31:05] Paul says listen I know God is real
[1:31:07] because he talked to me out of the light
[1:31:11] he spoke to me when nobody else heard
[1:31:15] his voice I heard his voice right and
[1:31:19] you know Festus say you know Festus ease
[1:31:22] and listen Paul you sound like you man
[1:31:24] so you got to understand when you really
[1:31:27] start talking about the supernatural to
[1:31:29] those who claim to be Christians they
[1:31:31] gonna think you are crazy I was just at
[1:31:35] a restaurant the other day and I was
[1:31:36] trying to tell this lady who tried to
[1:31:39] get me into her Christian program her
[1:31:42] daddy started some years ago and but
[1:31:44] anyway I was trying to tell him about a
[1:31:46] miracle that took place you know she was
[1:31:48] talking about different things and I
[1:31:50] just cut it off I say you know the Lord
[1:31:51] did ba ba ba ba ba dum he said well
[1:31:54] miracles do happen
[1:31:57] that's all she could say because she
[1:32:00] perhaps never seen one right but I'm the
[1:32:04] greatest miracle ever if you said I have
[1:32:07] never seen a miracle you're not even
[1:32:09] saying you're the greatest miracle ever
[1:32:13] tell me how God changed you and change
[1:32:17] your desires from what you used to have
[1:32:19] into what you are now
[1:32:21] only God can do that right I don't need
[1:32:25] to see a miracle with someone else when
[1:32:26] God has done this great thing with me
[1:32:28] y'all have no idea I'm so glad that all
[1:32:31] my sins are under the blood I'm so glad
[1:32:35] it's under the blood because you would
[1:32:36] have know oh you probably have me as a
[1:32:39] preacher you know and that's the way
[1:32:40] wait you know God does things like he do
[1:32:43] things like that like Moses you know I
[1:32:44] always often wonder how many y'all would
[1:32:47] have joined Moses Church seeing that he
[1:32:48] was a murderer how many y'all would have
[1:32:52] followed David you understand me knowing
[1:32:56] that David committed adultery know how
[1:32:58] many y'all understand me
[1:33:07] but God's God god never left him he's
[1:33:12] still in the book he said I'm saying
[1:33:15] that's why you had to be led by the
[1:33:17] Spirit of God now Paul said who should
[1:33:20] separate see when when Paul comes to a
[1:33:23] place he says who should separate me
[1:33:25] from the love of Christ shall
[1:33:27] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:33:28] or famine or nakedness peril or sword
[1:33:30] and I thought this song good this is a
[1:33:33] good song when I walk into the valley
[1:33:36] what I've never been before I keep
[1:33:40] searching for a way out it seemed like
[1:33:42] the apparent locks on the door how many
[1:33:44] of you been there y'all young people you
[1:33:47] it's coming you got it it's coming when
[1:33:50] you're trying to find a way out of it
[1:33:52] like this door is locked
[1:33:56] no way to get out but understand god
[1:33:59] will make the way out you see what I'm
[1:34:02] saying is like Moses you know how I'm
[1:34:03] gonna get out of this situation
[1:34:05] amen Pharaoh's coming here the widow the
[1:34:08] seeds behind me the mountains there way
[1:34:10] to run Lord ha I'm gonna get out and God
[1:34:12] says stand still and that's what God
[1:34:15] will do young people he'll bring you to
[1:34:17] a place where you just got to trust him
[1:34:19] you have no choice that's where he
[1:34:22] really wants you the strength your
[1:34:24] strength is inside it's not in your head
[1:34:26] is in your heart because when all of
[1:34:29] this is gone and y'all know it's gonna
[1:34:31] go when the squeeze come on some of us
[1:34:34] won't be able to see each other nor
[1:34:36] connect with each other what you gonna
[1:34:38] do then that's what I try to tell people
[1:34:41] y'all don't understand how close this
[1:34:42] thing is this could happen next year or
[1:34:45] this coming year with the new elections
[1:34:47] and everything we don't know how it's
[1:34:48] going to swing we don't know and this
[1:34:52] thing can all happen overnight like in
[1:34:54] Russia and all these other when when
[1:34:57] people go to sleeping in the next one
[1:34:58] and they wake up and tanks running down
[1:35:00] their streets my men one man's decision
[1:35:04] and you don't have no idea that this
[1:35:06] thing can happen to you and when it
[1:35:08] happens where you gonna go who do you
[1:35:10] turn to in those times of troubles
[1:35:12] there's got to be a Jesus Christ in your
[1:35:15] life he's got to be real he's got to be
[1:35:17] more than what mama daddy said he was
[1:35:19] you got to know who he is you have to
[1:35:23] know this is why I keep moving the way
[1:35:26] I'm moving and telling you I'm trying
[1:35:28] says Lord give these young people not
[1:35:31] just wrong but the elders should have
[1:35:32] been here too
[1:35:34] they need a thirst too don't look at
[1:35:37] these old people they're discouraging
[1:35:40] the truth is they're discouraging
[1:35:47] discouraging don't look at them to
[1:35:49] measure this message right you got to
[1:35:55] realize if you're typing a young
[1:35:57] generation that is to cross over the old
[1:35:59] generation is in trouble you don't want
[1:36:04] to think like that do you no but listen
[1:36:07] is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:36:10] today and forever then where is he
[1:36:13] some way you're supposed to see him when
[1:36:17] where's you're supposed to see him in
[1:36:18] the people's lives
[1:36:22] huh it's good you know it's the truth in
[1:36:25] what we've done we've done just what the
[1:36:26] Pharisees and the Sadducees did and I'm
[1:36:29] fitting closing just a bit but we are
[1:36:30] it's a point I want to make in a moment
[1:36:32] but the thing is we've done just what
[1:36:35] they've done
[1:36:36] we've cloaked ourselves
[1:36:40] with the message
[1:36:42] Jesus said oh you've had a cloak until I
[1:36:45] came right now you you you look like an
[1:36:49] uncorruptible Church
[1:36:53] nothing has corrupted to you you got the
[1:36:55] full word he said but I'm here I'm the
[1:36:59] discerner I can see they hated him did
[1:37:04] you know that the Pharisees and the
[1:37:07] Sadducees hated Jesus you know like the
[1:37:12] prophet of God said Pharisees mean to be
[1:37:14] an actor they acted like they weren't
[1:37:18] corrupted but they proved they were
[1:37:22] corrupted because they killed Jesus and
[1:37:24] they join an alliance with Rome and it
[1:37:30] was all about money
[1:37:36] they the Pharisees looked at Jesus
[1:37:38] Christ as an antagonist one that acted
[1:37:44] in opposition like he was waiting for
[1:37:46] him to mess up no he was just being the
[1:37:49] word and the word is corrective it
[1:37:53] people's a whole don't be judging me I'm
[1:37:54] not judging you I'm just saying you just
[1:37:57] missed the word the word is correct and
[1:37:59] you're not correct according through the
[1:38:01] word right it's it's you know you know
[1:38:05] to be that ameesha to oppose and they
[1:38:10] just thought he was hostile
[1:38:12] especially winning winning the temple
[1:38:14] and he whipped him out like that
[1:38:16] if I came in with a message like that I
[1:38:19] think I might get to the church y'all
[1:38:22] know what I'm saying
[1:38:23] people expect Jesus to be dodi they
[1:38:26] expect him to be all soft no no no he if
[1:38:30] there ever was a man ever man he was a
[1:38:32] real one
[1:38:33] he was the art fennec man and he got so
[1:38:38] upset with the religious system that he
[1:38:42] planted he got those plants and he
[1:38:46] planted that thing and he whipped him
[1:38:48] out of the temple
[1:38:51] making money off of the gospel that's
[1:38:57] all I'm saying
[1:38:59] Christ is always against every false way
[1:39:02] now you can't call something false if
[1:39:05] you're not the truth
[1:39:08] you've got to be the truth and when
[1:39:11] you're the truth there's a joy there's a
[1:39:13] peace there's a happiness do you go
[1:39:15] through battles absolutely but I'm
[1:39:18] trying to tell you all young people
[1:39:20] don't settle for what you see you see
[1:39:23] and you hear on those tapes and it read
[1:39:25] in this Bible and you want to you want a
[1:39:27] thirst for that that's what you want
[1:39:31] that kind of a life is what you want a
[1:39:33] thirst for not what you're seeing
[1:39:34] everybody else doing you know to me I
[1:39:37] think it's like you know it says Lord I
[1:39:39] said am I am I going crazy am i
[1:39:43] experiencing what you call a at the age
[1:39:46] of Vesta because all of the churches are
[1:39:50] coming together and they just having a
[1:39:52] great time but how many you have have
[1:39:54] come in says lord I hear your call
[1:39:59] they go from the embassy and they're
[1:40:01] having good meeting stirring up
[1:40:03] everybody
[1:40:04] but who's changed I want a stir you
[1:40:11] should won't change you supposed to go
[1:40:14] to church and have a good time but at
[1:40:16] the end of the day when you leave
[1:40:17] outside that door you want to leave out
[1:40:19] changed something that's a change that's
[1:40:23] all I'm saying
[1:40:24] and the strength of the Christian is
[1:40:26] what's inside of him which is God
[1:40:29] Himself can it get it can I go a little
[1:40:31] further because I was talking about you
[1:40:34] know how Jesus you know they couldn't
[1:40:36] stand Jesus they always tried to trap
[1:40:39] him and that's the way the devil is he's
[1:40:41] always trying to trap you one way or
[1:40:43] another hmm yes so anyway let's move on
[1:40:48] so I'll just say I'm a close with this
[1:40:51] start the reason why I like I like David
[1:40:57] as well
[1:40:58] there was a man of the god of hard and
[1:41:01] we know that but something dog quicker
[1:41:05] to me when I'm in my studying is was in
[1:41:07] 1st Samuel 17 and 2 in Saul and the men
[1:41:12] of Israel were gathered together and
[1:41:14] pitched by the Valley of Elah and set
[1:41:18] the battle in array against the
[1:41:20] Philistines and I thought now here we
[1:41:23] are you got a group on the mountain a
[1:41:26] group on the mountain and then saw pitch
[1:41:28] by by the way of the valley of elah and
[1:41:32] I thought now what does feel I mean a
[1:41:34] law means up here II lah is an oak and
[1:41:38] oak Oak like an oak tree but it also
[1:41:41] means a curse it means also perjury so
[1:41:47] you got this you know our oak tree lives
[1:41:50] a long time just like a curse can live a
[1:41:52] long time right perjury is when the
[1:41:57] willful giving of false testimony under
[1:42:00] oath or from affirmation before a
[1:42:05] competent tribunal upon a point of
[1:42:09] materia to legal inquiry in other words
[1:42:12] it's just giving a false testimony a
[1:42:14] false oh and here this is why David came
[1:42:18] on the scene because here they had
[1:42:20] settled down under a threat from Goliath
[1:42:25] and they were afraid but this was the
[1:42:29] army of the Living God
[1:42:32] you're the army of the Living God why
[1:42:35] should you fear even God said don't you
[1:42:39] consider you know what let's go hold
[1:42:42] tomorrow they look at the sparrow don't
[1:42:44] I take care of him surely your soul is
[1:42:48] greater than the sparrow but if you get
[1:42:51] timid about God's promises God cannot
[1:42:54] work for you you must be bold I I don't
[1:42:59] know what else to say it radical
[1:43:05] hallelujah
[1:43:07] is that right because listen Abraham I'm
[1:43:10] sure they said o Abraham come on you
[1:43:13] guys it's been 12 years now and you
[1:43:15] haven't had a baby I maybe I don't care
[1:43:17] what you say and you think he said it
[1:43:19] nicely you know I really believe that he
[1:43:25] has some emphasis it doesn't matter what
[1:43:29] you say God says so see and you have to
[1:43:34] talk to the devil like that
[1:43:36] you know you talk to the devil Odelle
[1:43:38] would please though don't give me those
[1:43:39] bad thoughts please sound like a crazy
[1:43:46] man if you won't do it's all right he
[1:43:49] said well you don't have to scream the
[1:43:50] devil here I scream even though he know
[1:43:52] I know he hears me because I want him to
[1:43:55] feel what I'm saying
[1:43:56] can you imagine think about the
[1:43:58] vibrations get out of here right get out
[1:44:05] of here that's a difference right
[1:44:08] knock him off his feet yeah
[1:44:12] so what I'm trying to say is it's all
[1:44:14] right
[1:44:15] they gonna call you crazy anyhow but
[1:44:18] here was they they think they actually
[1:44:21] come in a place that is cursed and they
[1:44:25] allowing the the devil amen and in
[1:44:28] gladly passage so they under this curse
[1:44:31] in this cursed place they're giving a
[1:44:33] Goliath a way into their place of
[1:44:38] heretic inheritance just like we do we
[1:44:43] feel like oh I'm going through this
[1:44:44] trial and well they let the devil we'll
[1:44:47] just let him run his course no he
[1:44:48] doesn't run no course you must stop the
[1:44:51] devil that's what God gives you the word
[1:44:53] for to stop the devil wherever he is if
[1:44:57] you are look great us believe that you
[1:45:00] are and start acting like you are and
[1:45:02] speaking like you are that passage you
[1:45:08] gotta you gotta move into that in that
[1:45:10] way so anyway you know they come to
[1:45:13] fight and David and like all of us we
[1:45:16] don't know how you know we don't know
[1:45:18] how to fight the enemy only only with
[1:45:21] the word but God brings these us to
[1:45:24] these tests these trials these are
[1:45:26] challenges so that we can learn how to
[1:45:29] trust in him because the Lord will fight
[1:45:32] your battles but you gotta trust him
[1:45:35] that the Lord will fight your battles
[1:45:37] you gotta say Lord I need you on this
[1:45:38] one hallelujah you don't just oh I'm out
[1:45:42] here no you in it because they said
[1:45:45] trust the Lord with all your heart right
[1:45:47] lean not to your own understanding if
[1:45:50] you acknowledge the Lord in all your
[1:45:53] ways he shall a will direct your path so
[1:46:01] here come David a little fella
[1:46:04] maybe maybe maybe he was no bigger than
[1:46:06] Isaac or no taller than Joel I don't
[1:46:10] know but he was Goliath he was nine feet
[1:46:13] nine nine feet nine inches right that
[1:46:20] that's six cubits and a span that's six
[1:46:23] and a half a cubic feet but in the
[1:46:26] inches that's nine feet and two inches
[1:46:30] I couldn't even jump in slapping so you
[1:46:34] got to realize this was a big guy and I
[1:46:37] don't think he was thin I think it was
[1:46:39] huge
[1:46:40] cuz of the way the arm and everything
[1:46:41] else was can you imagine his sword I
[1:46:45] think I was too faint for David to take
[1:46:48] his sword he just probably had to drag
[1:46:49] that thing over there and cut his head
[1:46:52] off you're not on me I don't know how he
[1:46:55] did it but as I was reading it I'm not
[1:46:57] here as a young boy trying to get this
[1:46:59] big old sword out of out of Goliath
[1:47:02] sheath and he had to pick that thing up
[1:47:04] and cut it head off food all right so
[1:47:09] you say what do you mean they were in
[1:47:11] the valley so that's where you meet
[1:47:13] Goliath in the valley
[1:47:17] you don't meet him on the mountain
[1:47:19] probably we the birds are singing on the
[1:47:21] Mount and the winds are blowing on the
[1:47:23] Mount and the breeze are smelling good
[1:47:24] but down in the valleys when the giant
[1:47:27] comes that's when he begins to say all
[1:47:30] he's going to say what you can't do you
[1:47:32] a failure you ain't gave do this you
[1:47:34] can't do that it ain't gonna happen
[1:47:36] this dog go too close odd devil shut up
[1:47:40] now you listen to all that stuff you
[1:47:43] lose your mind and have a breakdown
[1:47:47] shut him up when he tells you he's you
[1:47:51] losers are no devil you're the loser
[1:47:53] repeat it whatever he says back at him
[1:47:58] that's what David to hit everything the
[1:48:00] devil said to him David took it and he
[1:48:03] reversed it right and it just it's
[1:48:07] amazing you know David looked at his
[1:48:11] other fellow people and this is the way
[1:48:13] I look at everywhere I can't be like
[1:48:16] these people
[1:48:17] I just come so hard folks it just seemed
[1:48:20] like everybody is so afraid of Goliath
[1:48:22] and nobody want to take the challenge
[1:48:23] this message bring you to a challenge
[1:48:26] you got to make up your mind whether
[1:48:28] you're gonna do it are you going to go
[1:48:30] all the way with this mess all the way
[1:48:32] with Jesus Christ what you gonna do with
[1:48:33] it go all the way oh they even in the in
[1:48:37] the message they tell you you too
[1:48:38] religious or you think you better can
[1:48:41] tell you some of these old folks don't
[1:48:43] like it when young people really get in
[1:48:44] the spirit of God they don't like it
[1:48:47] they didn't like it in my day and then
[1:48:49] gonna like it in your day right they're
[1:48:52] gonna think just like David Brothers say
[1:48:54] oh you come over here and now you out of
[1:48:56] place right you just come over here to
[1:48:59] show off that's what they think when
[1:49:02] you're serving God and trying to give
[1:49:03] them your heart they think you're trying
[1:49:05] to show off and all you want to do is
[1:49:08] give God all your heart but they did it
[1:49:12] to David you don't think they're gonna
[1:49:13] do it to you but David says wait a
[1:49:17] minute is there not a cause is there not
[1:49:20] a cause
[1:49:21] look Alliance is making all this boast
[1:49:24] against you and nobody's going out to
[1:49:26] fight in you look at the devil here's
[1:49:30] the pride of Jesus Christ oppose we
[1:49:32] marching to the tune of the word it is
[1:49:34] never shown where she ever stopped
[1:49:38] and we're afraid of today's world with
[1:49:41] we were so afraid that who you know
[1:49:43] don't know how to fast we don't know how
[1:49:44] to pray we're almost afraid of the
[1:49:47] supernatural but you gotta be more
[1:49:48] consecrated to see it yeah even the
[1:49:53] prophet of God God said no before you go
[1:49:55] any further you've got to be more
[1:49:57] sincere this way is a safar sincere
[1:50:01] Christian it ain't for people who looks
[1:50:03] just want to play around with it it's
[1:50:06] got to be real to you it's got to be
[1:50:09] your heartbeat I want it more than
[1:50:12] anything else how they do you well imma
[1:50:18] cut it short but that's what happened
[1:50:21] this is what I love about it just trying
[1:50:23] to get you to see it you know your
[1:50:25] weapon might be rocks go it may be a
[1:50:31] slingshot it may be a rod whatever you
[1:50:35] got in your hand use it all of our
[1:50:39] talents are different
[1:50:41] right ain't gotta use every bit of it
[1:50:44] whatever it is it was just a few fish
[1:50:47] and loaves of bread gotta use it if it's
[1:50:50] just two Mike's got to use it don't
[1:50:52] think that God just got you sitting here
[1:50:54] with no talents you've got something to
[1:50:56] offer every one of us got something to
[1:50:59] offer and I just believe if these young
[1:51:02] people if you all would just pull
[1:51:03] together and just Lord you know we got
[1:51:06] to have some prayer we got to do
[1:51:07] something
[1:51:08] you know constructive you know for the
[1:51:12] kingdom of God I believe God I answer
[1:51:15] your prayer I believe God hears you he
[1:51:18] sees your desires and I know my desire
[1:51:21] is because I just believe that I was
[1:51:23] sent here for a purpose
[1:51:24] I didn't leave Ohio to come to Iowa just
[1:51:29] a pastor another term
[1:51:32] I've seen God do some great things in my
[1:51:34] life and I've asked God one more time
[1:51:38] I like to see it done
[1:51:41] and I believe God is going to do it I
[1:51:43] really do and I believe that you all are
[1:51:46] part of it but the vision itself must
[1:51:48] can only be completed by the people in
[1:51:50] the goose
[1:51:51] all of us gotta walk is saying God
[1:51:54] Cleveland cleaving like Paul did they
[1:51:57] cleaved each other take lead to the word
[1:51:59] they lead to the Lord I just say to you
[1:52:02] cleave to him let the strength of God
[1:52:03] grow in you I know it's a press it is a
[1:52:07] press but don't think that everything
[1:52:09] that you go through is it is for purpose
[1:52:12] and God let make that purpose come to
[1:52:15] glorify you love the Lord
[1:52:18] god is so good to us
[1:52:23] that's a amazing grace
[1:52:30] oh sweet
[1:52:38] ah

[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:54:40] you know I I thought that at the end of
[1:54:46] this service of preaching we could sing
[1:54:49] some more but how I'm just gonna ask
[1:54:52] everybody if they don't mind just

[1:55:06] go any further if we really mean it and
[1:55:10] we really want God to do something for
[1:55:12] the young people in Iowa I think this is
