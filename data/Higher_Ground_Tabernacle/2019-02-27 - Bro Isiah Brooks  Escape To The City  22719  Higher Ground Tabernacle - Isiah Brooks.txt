of y'all you know me here right we always miss you when you're not here okay Isaiah the fourth chapter we're going to read coming from the second verse we read down to the sixth verse in the Daysha in that day she had the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem and when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of Boerne the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be defense and there shall be a tabernacle for shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for covered from the storm and from rain let us pray father God we come before you lord jesus as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness Lord you have been better to us and we've been to ourselves and father I don't know how to put this together but you gave us the thought and we're just committing everything into your hands Lord we pray that you would just have your way tonight in your name Lord Jesus Christ move me my person out of the way we want to just see your person on display break and destroy the yoke to the enemy and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we're living in the last days and everybody knows something is about to happen whether you be a religious person or a non-religious person everybody knows that the world is falling apart and really everybody does it they don't know really where to run there are those who are trying to escape and thinking that somehow they'll be able to build on underground shelter some think they can run to the mountain some think that they could you know perhaps discover something on Mars and put a planet put on some type of refuge up there you know people got all kinds of crazy ideas and as if God is stupid and he doesn't know what he's doing but we know one thing that God is God and I heard the prophet of God say which is so true the Word of God declares it that the law of God makes every seed produces itself whether it is a seed of wheat or whether it be a sea of a kookabura seed or any kind of a weed it doesn't matter God is the creator of all things understand that even when when he said in the garden God has given me a man or a son however she put it I mean God is the only one that could have given it to her if Satan could have given her a son he would have made him a creator but the law of God had already been established at every seat should bring forth of his kind and so we realized by God's grace it doesn't matter I mean what the world thinks and and what the ideas are when it comes to the bride of Jesus Christ because we're not the one who's producing this thing we're not the ones who's going to make it happen it is God who will make it all happen something is about to happen and everybody knows it the animals knows it they don't know which way to fly anymore they don't know where to find shelter I mean everything the earth knows it it's wobbling and carrying on like a drunkard and the seasonal changes are or changes because the word world in itself knows it's about ready to give birth now we understand by God's grace that there's only one way of escape there's only one place of refuge there's only one place where a man can hide in this day I am I I like to title this message escape to the city escape to the city if I had a subtopic it would be the right to no penalty the right to no penalty because you got to realize amen the Bible says that for every transgression there's a just recompense he is that all right the Bible also tells us that for the wages of sin is death but there is a gift and that gift of God is eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ so we think about escaping that means we get free of we whatever had us in bondage now has been done away with we have come to a place where we're no longer held by whatever had us in bondage it means that the Fowler's snare has been broken and you and I must understand also that only God can do that God is the only one that can break the Fowler's snare now when we talk about penalty you and I understand that God told Adam and Eve the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die now God has a law and I want you to understand that this law was given even to Moses before Joshua established it this law was given and I'm going to go through that law it's called this law was dealing with a place of refuge and these cities were named by God himself and we must understand by God's grace that God knew man was going to sin and he knew Israel was going to sin and we know he knew that Israel was going to do things that they should not have not be doing and he also knew that something that they would do would be by accident and some things they would do would be by being deliberate when I was thinking about this refuge and because you got to realize that God has a great plan he he's amazing in what he does and he wants us to know how much he really loves us you know even though he told Adam and Eve you shall surely died he comes right back with his grace and makes a way a refuge you understand me and you know when when I think about it I think about how when Adam and Eve sinned now the Bible says that Eve was deceived she was tricked into it but Adam eyes was wide open hello and he was influenced by the murderer we call Satan Oh Lucifer and when Adam walked out he walked out and then to save his bride but you gotta understand regardless to what his reasoning were he still broke the Word of God and God found a way to save Adam he was guilty both of them were guilty even though they tried to blame the other is that right the only one that did not get away was the man who did it deliberately and that was the serpent hmm cuz that was the law of refuge you could go into a city and be safe if you accidentally killed but it was if it was premeditated you could not you would not be allowed in the city in other words you had to run for your life and we look at this thing and we says oh what a horrible punishment now watch this because when Cain slew Abel God presented him with a way of escape but his answer toward God made it clear that King purposely intentionally meditatively killed his brother Abel and the pivoting of that was to mark him there was no salvation for Cain there was no place of refuge for Cain there was no escaping the penalty and the penalty was death God excommunicated Cain and the Bible said came from that monel went out of the presence of God that's real he was dead before he died right now watch this I don't want to jump but you got to understand there's a reason why the Bible says a voice walked in the cool of the evening because that voice he meant was the Tree of Life that voice in itself was God right so because God cannot find another place a refuge outside of himself God is my refuge David said he's my refuge he's my hiding place he's eclipsed in the rock and you and I must understand and then that God is calling in all of us murderers by birth and you and I must realize listen for the man who said it like this he said these CDs were for people men who accidentally killed he said that's the way it is he said you've got two kinds of people people who don't want to live sinfully people who don't enjoy sin he said those cities were built for them and he said but that man who loves sin don't want to have nothing to do with Christ or salvation he's a murderer and he receives the penalty of a murderer he must die you know how the law would go the law would be that if it was by accident and I'm just gonna because we don't have that much time if it was by accident that man had to run because he had if he killed this man and this man had a brother or had some cousins or uncle's or whatever were would be compelled because they were under the the the law an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth you killed my brother I'm killing you and those men or whoever would be they had to run escape the city and God had already designed another city a place where they could find refuge is that right first of all when that man if he was to get in a come to the city he had to first a men get by pasty the gatekeeper the judges they had to hear the trial they had to hear what he had to say and he had to plead oh lord have mercy on me huh I didn't mean to do it this is how it really was and they would judge that and if it was found worthy of the city he would come in and it was a law among Israel no matter what the crime was that person was safe but if he purposely did it the relatives of that man could come it didn't matter if the man was on the horns of the altar they could drag that man out of the city just to kill him oh come on somebody I'm coming by God's grace because I want you to understand that this message that we have God has designed it for our refuge hallelujah did it's not the scripture said that a man will become our refuge I mean because that man is all it has always been a man hallelujah though the lamb was slain the lamb in itself was a man and that's the only way you go to find refuge is under the blood of Jesus Christ there's so many people who think well the blood of Jesus Christ if you were under the blood of Jesus Christ that blood would change you blood would sanctify you that blood will fill you and the life of that blood will enter into you the Sun shines and the judgment it doesn't matter the Sun will shine you know it on the just and the unjust the rain falls on the on the just and the unjust but the rain can't change what the seed is neither can the Sun the Sun in the rain only produces what the seed is Oh somebody help me here I love this it brings a peace it brings a joy to my soul to know it meant that I can only produce what I am and God has determined that hallelujah Jesus even sitting I'm skipping a little bit but Jesus said all that the father has given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast him out ha because I know him and I know he didn't need to sin in the first place somebody helped me here he was tricked into it hmm see God want us to realize him and that one thing he can't do and I think a lot of time we fail and I say we I'm just generalizing everything we fail to see that God cannot lie but Hebrews 6 17 through 20 says we're we're in God willing more abundantly to show unto the air of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which was it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation and who have fled for refuge to lay a hold upon the hope set before us what was this hope City a place of hiding see we have what we must flee in any oh I'm just gonna get there no sir this is a time to run this is a time to escape you and I know that the Lord is soon to come we know it we don't have to wait for the California earthquake we know it's coming the you and I must realize it meant if you're caught outside of the city the devil who is the executioner has a right to you he is the Avenger of blood he Amen we'll take care of you if you caught outside of the blood only those who are in the blood in Christ will be safe from this guy wherefore the Runner is for us entered I love this because he defeated Satan the forerunner we know we deserve death we know it meant that we are guilty but God came to save those who did who was tricked into it the understanding those a men who didn't mean to do it you know that's how come we can repent you repeat because you didn't mean to do it you repent because she was tricked into it Satan got the best of you right how many of you times you tried to do good and evil was came out of something you tried to do good it's just a way to devil can do things where the venom tells about this story how he went to visit this man who was in prison he was a black man and he got there at the prison he says what a good-looking handsome intelligent black man like yourself doing in here he said I'll tell you the story he said I used to be a Christian he said and and my name was a bishop so my friends would call me holy bishop he said but I got tired and I slipped and I ended up going with the wrong crowd and he said these boys in the neighborhood wanted me to take them to the store said my wife told me not to take him said a they were bad boys they gonna get you in trouble he said I started let him drive my conscience but she said no don't let him do that they're tearing up said I just decided to drive him took him up to the store and while I waited outside I heard gun fires I heard the bullets go off the gun go off and all of a sudden the guys come running out they had robbed the place you see and I tried to tell no no no no I'm not a part of this you got to tell them you know I've got a part of this I'm innocent everything they cracked him upside the head but the girl says listen we're gonna throw you outside out of the car if you don't know if you're not gonna go with us you're gonna get caught anyway and the guy said well you're not going to get away and he said by that time the police came see that's how the devil do you in the wrong place at the wrong time at the right time for the devil right here so he's a trickster hallelujah is that all right let me tell you something you gotta escape you gotta run when you see the devil setting you up you gotta run you can't just play with the devil it's like Joseph when Potiphar's wife they make a man you know sir their husband in the head and she saw him and Joseph when she went after him Jones have been played I don't know how he pushed her away I remember the Bible said he escaped he left his clothes and everything an escape he had to run he had to flee from the situation Oh somebody help me here you can't play with the devil even you don't chose him then playing it parva wife did he was a pot she was a part of the whole thing but he didn't plan it what do you do he had a choice I could follow to this woman or run from her but this woman is a woman of authority she can really get me in trouble she did but he did not know that he was in the plan of God y'all hear me so what am I trying to say this young man Amen with the court he had a shrewd a prosecutor and the prosecutor says sir was this your car he says yeah but he says no no no just answer my question yes sir he said were you in the car yes oh but but no no no just ask Mike I said yes and you know were you with these guys anyway at the end of the questioning he was found guilty and he had to spend ten years in prison for something he did not mean to do brother LEM said that's the way it is Satan is a shrewd fella he gets you in trouble and you have to pay for it and then who comes and get you out however yeah he's our y'all hear what I'm saying God had to sit up and you know what the man was I used to be Christian and God sent a prophet and pray for him that he might get paroled you understand me see Amen we are in a situation now that we didn't need to be in but with true sons and daughters of God we just did not happen to happen we were here and in God's sauce before the foundation of the world we were in him but now look at us fallen we didn't mean to do it we didn't intend to be born sinners but God allowed it to happen so that we can see he ears our xscape he is our refuge hallelujah see you and I must understand that the blood of Jesus Christ saved the whole world did you know that the blood of Jesus Christ when it dropped on the earth saved the whole world did you know that that when when the world went through a flood him in the north day and that was justification did you know Amen that God justified us even in the soil the body that you're now occupying was justified even then hallelujah and then Jesus came don't tell me you can't be sanctified because he already sanctified you the blood sanctify and if God can sanctify the dirt before I get into it Oh what can he do with me in my spirit hallelujah but it will do nobody it won't do you any good if you don't accept it huh see you got to accept your salvation in order to be saved I didn't say almost accept it I think I'm saying you got to believe it about faith that you are saying that's how you get sanctified you got to believe that you're sanctified by faith before you ever become sanctified you got to believe you sanctified before you ever get the Holy Ghost you got to believe I got it it's mine it's for me otherwise you won't get it if you keep wondering the reason for me am i one of them no sure without faith it's impossible to please God listen you're running for your life you must escape mm-hmm is that okay the Bible says for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's you don't I mean you inherited things vain traditions but with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot prevailing for four days before the foundation of the world but was manifested in these last times for you what are you saying though death is raining seemingly seemingly because the Bible tells us that Christ called could death hell and the grave it just appeared to see it seems like he has power but it has no power God's tripped him up those y'all better hear what I'm saying but you see with all even though Satan have been stripped of all his power it'll do you no good until you believe that do you receive it Oh somebody help me here you must believe that you are the god of Satan and not Satan is your God ah because you and I are eternal and Satan is not eternal you must realize he meant there's a reason oh Lord understand there was only six cities that they could escape to with the natural six but I added two more I believe God showed me this he didn't right there in the scripture Oh help me Lord let me go through it in just a moment first of all I want you to realize that God is sovereign mmm when God said whatsoever thing you desire when you pray believe you receive that whatsoever thing you desire these things that I'll do share you also for I go to my father that's true he says listen it's true he's sovereign you're gonna prove him wrong now if you desire to be in a rapture who gave you the desire if you desire to be holy who gave you that desire and then come from Lucifer he's wicked you and I know what it wants to be under him hello but God said he has broken the chains of darkness hallelujah we always talk about this message being the message of Jubilee but the Jubilee has sounded and therefore every one of us didn't tonight can go free ain't no excuse you got take scape now all slave didn't go free they really enjoyed their masters and when they would return or stay there the master would take ore and void it that's why we don't wear earrings because it is symbolic of slavery and when they board they would bore you in the ear everybody knew now that you you know your slave an intentional slave hmm but gotta say a scale or diversity I'm gonna tell you something the Bible says Strait is the gate narrow is the way and only a few be that find it it ain't gonna be such a great multitude because many of the most of the people have chosen to be slaves hallelujah but to those who want to be free God said he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Paul says listen I will not be in bondage to no man to nothing hallelujah that's our Liberty in Christ he is the city of refuge I'm jumping now sometimes you may feel like you ain't worth nothing but I'm worth more than you think so are you the Prophet God said one soul is worth ten thousand worlds look at me look at yourself God has said you worth more than ten thousand words not just one not just to not just three but ten thousand where's hallelujah remember the story about this uh bomb Oh homeless man homeless man is what it was and uh somehow he got hit by a car and the injuries were really severe all the doctors and everything and they looked at him and the doctors began to talk within themselves not knowing that the man was awake and says well you know he's just a bomb and he ain't he ain't worth nothing he ain't worth nothing he he hasn't contributed anything to society you know they were really down and the man did not know didn't know that the man was a lie and the man somehow mustered up enough strength turned over his listen I'm worth something hallelujah Jesus Christ died for my sins I was something who can put a price and this my thought who can put a price on the blood of Jesus you could there's no man no woman no King of Prince a priest a pope or bishop amen they could pay the value measure up to the value of the blood of Jesus hmm what people don't understand is that tough your soul is worth ten thousand worlds that's right and people determine their own destiny by their own choosing is that right you know you think about all what do you say I'm saying this did not King decide he made his own decision against God but he couldn't help it because of the seed that he was hallelujah but then you take Abel he was a man of grace and mercy lord have mercy on me he understood he was worthy of death and he needed a way of escape and the only way that he could get gained this way of escape was to through the death of something else hallelujah and we saw by revelation that that it it needed a lamb his escape was a lamb hallelujah innocent creature he meant something that was so innocent to me that God saw it as being innocent you understand me there is a hiding place for the righteous I'm jumping because of the tonight and hopefully I'll be able to teach it better but you know my thought is that you and I must understand that when the when God established these cities by way of the law Moses was already off the scene but God told Joshua says listen you coming into the Promised Land you coming into the is that right amen Canaan was not heaven Canaan was symbolic of the Holy Ghost you hadn't even fought in the battles until you get it hallelujah till you cross over the Jordan you said what do you mean yes you got a cross over Jordan Joshua crossed over Jordan and then everybody that needed to cross over daughter/father Jordan Joshua is that right you cannot get into the Promised Land without a death to yourself Jesus had to die in the spiritual way you understand me he hasn't died naturally that he may open a way into that spiritual lay Oh somebody help me and the Bible tells us that even even in Hebrew it tells us Amen that we have a inka I ain't got the soul hallelujah because Jesus had already cross over and goes into the veil and as Joshua we following Joshua we follow Jesus because Jesus is Joshua hallelujah and you got a guy in order to resurrect a man and that's the problem so many people they look at the the order of salvation and they come to the justification you know like Luther feh Luthor you know Luther said the just shall live by faith a man that was good for his day where she said oh I need to be sanctified that was good for his day Pentecostal comes up and say well I got to have the baptism hallow that was good for their day hallelujah but they had never gone into the other place we call it the Holy of Holies hallelujah and see when you go into the Holies of Holies you don't come back out you understand me here they like Giarrusso I'm jumping in with a man you gotta realize they meant that the Holies of Holies when you're baptized over you feel door sealed with the Holy Ghost you are entering into a different dimension is that right oh you've crossed over the seventh and now you into eternity which which has no days we don't we don't there you know I'm thousand years old oh when you get born again you move out of the seventh into the eighth is that okay listen even in the news like this songs of Solomon says oh my dog thou art the cleft of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see that countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and the countenance is comely now he says in the secret place understand that means everybody it's a secret everybody don't know where is that brother man comes along any ties in the pyramid and he tells how those seven steps leads into the King's Chamber and you and I we can play with this thing all we want to but you can't this this is the way back home you understand me this is a way back home it is the place where we were before we got here huh this is the way back home and listen if you are see the raw of God will make this happen in you not by power not by might but by my spirit says the Lord who you gotta escape we don't realize how important it is to us to really accept Malachi 4 and believe that God sent a prophet people don't understand but you see without the voice of God it wasn't his voice that we're listening to is the voice in the voice it is ordained voice Peter said God made an entrance this is the entrance the denomination's know nothing about it organizations know nothing about it is right there in the book and they don't understand it but it is given to the elected to know the mysteries of the kingdom it is given to us and now you don't have to worry he that begun the good work in you its faithful to complete it God ain't gonna leave you on the side of the road o that the father is given all that come to me God Jesus that God said I will in no wise cast him out where are you brother Brooks I'm on my way hallelujah to the place where the father has ordained for me to be I'm going to escape in other words I have escaped and I'm on my journey y'all know that he so all what do you mean brothers let me tell you something once that news went out he meant that somebody was dead in the family and it was this man did it oh they dropped everything and they ran after this man whoever he was he couldn't say well I'm on my way to the city no sure he had to run he had to detective bust up energy from somewhere because he realized once he got behind the walls he was safe think about it why because the Avenger of blood was after him you love Lord O Lord we ought to be grateful because the all-seeing eye sees us he's the judge he's the jury he's the attorney he's everybody he's everything he's the man that would judge and see whether you can enter into the city hallelujah he don't have to worry about your story of your lips the Bible said he's a discerner of the heart he knows he goes down to the heart and he sees is that right oh come on somebody remember the woman just just use her for an example Amen who was caught in adultery and everything else and and all of the preachers they felt like they should be the revenger blood caught in the act hallelujah but there was a judge that was higher than all of the judges greater than all of the preachers hallelujah and when he finished the court was out the case was dismissed the case was dismissed and he says why man where are your accusers somehow Isiah picked up others had no weapon formed against you shall prosper hallelujah Amen have you come into judgment nobody judgment nobody's account will a matter with God why cuz you washed in the blood oh lord help me Jesus it's perfect hallelujah he's not sacrificed he's the one that died instead hallelujah y'all understand me he's your sacrifice hallelujah Oh somebody help me here see the City of Refuge of course you got to realize that if a man killed a man I said it early just deliberately premeditated he was locked he could not come to this place but it he did accidentally he he didn't mean to do it somebody help me here look at God maybe wonderful now I'm gonna go to this through the six cities but I gotta jump to the seventh one in first I gotta go to the seventh one first the seventh one is the new Giroud that the new with Jerusalem because remember that rule room is now a City of Refuge it's not mentioned it's in there because all the Jews escaping Hitler Mussolini and everybody ran back to Jerusalem is that right oh Jesus have mercy they killed Jesus they killed a man and they said let his blood be on us and our children somebody help me but we know by the opening of the wire that the Jews only did it Paul said the eyes were blinded didn't mean to do it somebody help me here what happens in the Almighty God becomes the judge the jury the attorney and the Bible say the corner Isaiah could it happen can a man be born in one day what is it the same one they crucified and then becomes the judge the jury he attorney hallelujah says don't you worry about it I will give you a revival I know you didn't mean to do it because I blinded you because I wanted a Gentile bride hallelujah and because of that oh my Indra has the greatest revival ever 144,000 get the Holy Ghost one time [Laughter] hallelujah what happens and they bath God brought them into eternity in one day Oh somebody help me and to show that even when they killed them they will not stay in the grave God brings on Moses and Elijah comes along and they kill Moses and Elijah and Gaza yeah and you but I want you to see what I'm getting ready to do I'm not only raised I'd be all but I raised up the new I raise up those who trusted in me because when they hid in that word they were faithful in the word they stood on the word and now I'm gonna stand for them huh whoo Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee huh but for the man who loves sin that man a man who who loved darkness that's what the Bible says why people won't repent because they love darkness rather than light but for that man that says oh lord have mercy have mercy on me God I didn't intend to do it thought I didn't mean to lie I didn't mean to steal whatever even my nature got the best of me help me Jesus there's always a balm in Gilead no wonder David said thou art my hiding place and my shield I hope in thy word we need to escape and you know people look at me say oh I got it you know because I shouted I danced I spoke in tongues that don't mean a thing God needs to see light hallelujah is that okay hallelujah we won't we don't want to be your grafted vine a grafted branch or anything we want to be coming from the root he's the root and I was bring them up David hallelujah he's a very live stream of David hallelujah and he's our live stream what's in the root comes out in the branches that's why the Prophet God said in Pentecost if they ever put forth another branch hallelujah not these pretenders the real thing but you got to cross over hmm it's crossing over time see you got to understand they they cross over Jordan in the worst time in the worst season the waters was risen and high and everything else y'all know what that means that means it was a lot of pressure how we gonna get across hallelujah huh hey the waters running fast and high and lift it up God said I'm gonna show you how to do it you don't know how to die but this is your season to die I don't care how your trials are I don't care what your travels are even I don't care see like though the waters in water represents people bringing you all kinds of trouble this is your crossing over time said I want you to tell you what I'm gonna do you let the word go first put the wine fires try to lujah then you can put the horn then you can shout then you can dance hallelujah but stay behind the world and they crossed over one thing about these cities they were provided by God hello one thing about these virtues they're provided by God somebody help me here they're provided by God and guess what they were provided by grace you can't work this thing God gives it by grace the next thing we realize amen it's just that God initiates it you know instead what I mean God told Moses before Joshua was even in income and what the cities would be and what they were before and where to place them is that right I think if I got it correctly three cities were placed on the mountaintop and three cities was in the valley see because even when you're Nevada there's a place of refuge hallelujah that's what David said though I walk through the valley the shadow of death I fear no evil this God is always there for you and I you and me is that right and God provided it he made it easy did you know wherever these cities were when something went wrong in wherever you were amen it was easy Lee accept accessible they had a road that led to the city I'm enjoying myself cuz I just said there is a way somebody help me here a highway but in that highway there is away he said it's gonna be so simple to fool on there come unto me all these are the late and heavy laden and I give you rest Seppo take your yoke upon me write and I'll give you rest huh cast your cares upon him for he cares for you he's the caretaker he's the man that you need to see but you need to get on the straight and the narrow right he provides it the blood has already been shed the road has already been paid it's simple we make it complicated because we get self in it let go and let God hallelujah be that are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God ooo you ain't lead nothing you following you following the Holy Spirit you are a sheep he's the shepherd just follow him do I feel like shouting but I got a preach and in that city that city had power to save it was ordained I don't care what who did what once they got behind the wall those who came to kill could not go behind the wall unless there was a murder there who intended and usually the judges catches them and they can't come in is that right because remember in New Jerusalem that devout Bible says ain't no murder was gonna be there ain't no dogs gonna be there no dogs so don't call me dog what's up dog no I'm not a dog don't let nobody call you a dog they had the power to save and see once a man was inside the inside his case was heard by the elders and if it determined that they determined it meant that the death had indeed been an accident he was given a place of safety in the city as long as he stayed in the city y'all know what I'm saying people come to Christ and they have to why they don't want to stay in there you leave out of the city your protection is gone stayin God saying Christ you hit people or they just complain and murmur all the time amen you're saved stay in the city stay in Christ is that right no he said if the elders kept hearing you complain about being in there they put you out you don't want to be put out come on somebody you gotta you gotta enjoy think about why you're there haha what you exhale hallelujah and listen it didn't matter Amen if the relative was out there outside of the wall we gonna get you we don't catch you someday I don't care but I'm behind the wall you can't give me that fact I can look through the gate and see you and you can't touch me y'all hear what I'm saying they had that power that city had that power to secure to secure you and like I said as long as you stay in cries you are safe you're safe from death you're safe from hell you save them from the grave Halloween is that right that's why Paul said Holgrave where's you're staying Oh death where so stay Oh grave Oh victory what I have a refuge thanks be to god who gives me victory did you know that man had to stay in there as long as that priest lived he stayed there and once the priest died he can go free and nobody could touch him because he lived to see the priest die hallelujah oh my but you llamas realized we have a priest that cannot die it's eternal somebody help me here you got to escape this world come out of her my people you gotta escape the doors open wide open I just love it the way Jesus died he didn't die like this he died like this the door is wide open I am the door is that right he said maybe come by me thieves and robbers and all of that but I am the door I am the sheepfold I'm the keeper I know who comes by here and they don't get in he said yeah that's what he said the power you know everything you know in the city yeah you know they have all your needs in there and it's sufficient you know you don't have to go out for nothing they make sure they supply you did you know and you know because they the cities were they had suburbs they had places where they grow food and in the water and everything was out there and you didn't have to go out there they served you actually you you you it meant me amen because we were we were not guilty we didn't mean to do it and those angels you know what I'm saying they serving us servants saving serving us is this okay amen I don't mean to go too long but you know I'm looking at this thing and I want you to understand we've got to escape the thing about it is that they were available to all they were accessible to all is that right they were prominent like I said built on a mountaintop for what for all to see so you were able to see it wherever you were you ran you got on that road to it and you could see it you you saw your yo yo yo our finish line your finish point hallelujah glory to God whoo is this okay they were all you know the door was always open you know the gate was always open you had people there who were always looking for the offenders you know I'm saying you know just think about it if a man you running from someone and and and and and you know say that reaches at the gate and I'm and the man is right behind me and rich just snatched me on in there looking for the offenders I'm here to help you God is here to help us get there if you keep running you'll find out there's somebody right look is that okay it's the truth they were always looking for offenders you know that was their job when you see Amen somebody giving it heart to the Lord we don't see the invisible but the Bible said angels in camp about those who fear God angel the Lord who you think Amen telling you don't do that that's your theophany that's God has the power to secure you it has the power 8-minute like I said and been built on top of mountain so you can see it they were what they were constantly looking for offenders to come the role was not called the gates were never closed and the direction was never confused everybody knew where the cities of refuge were brought up as a child hello that's why children need to know who Jesus is from childhood they need to know and then there's a place there's a way to escape this world now I'm gonna go through these names quickly somebody buddy said brother books you don't have a right to do that all I know is what God told me I had a Jubilee time the first one was Kadish and each name each city had a name and each name had a meaning Kadish mean righteousness Sikkim mean showdown Hebron means fellowship right so you if you did wrong you had a city of righteousness you could run to that all right if you need God to bear you up like a sheep to shepherd bare the sheep on his shoulder y'all hear me hallelujah chicken was your place if he believed you needed fellowship Hebron was Fellowship dezer be easy ER mid fortress and know one thing to come with a scripture to show you that all of these cities were types and shadows of the attributes of God as a savior as a healer as a deliverer hallelujah rame up means Heights huh search searching know the breadth the height and the death hmm go long with joy you there's a city for you now that's just six of them list it because that was natural Israel right that was the time when Israel needed somewhere to run when they made mistakes like killing and murder or whatever you want to call it but you see now Jerusalem because of what Israel did at the crucifixion of Jesus they be murderers and they've suffered because they've been had no place to run and no place to hide no matter search the history no matter where the Jews went they were persecuted before Stalin and Hitler came they had a hard time because they said let his blood be on us and our children so all of their children were guilty of what they'd committed and so therefore they were they were dealt with it and God had the blood of vengeance that's why people hated the Jews no matter where they would go I think was uh which was Wesley the one that that looted one of the ones that didn't have a revelation who I have to call the Jews Antichrist actually but see that city Jerusalem supposed to be a city of peace but since they've been there all they had was bars but still they're now building a wall a place of refuge it's in this future that I don't have time to go go through it but I'll continue it Sunday evening and we realized by God's grace still there's war still they died priest dying everything that was the old Jerusalem but that ain't the final one you got seven days and brother Brennan said it's like seven Church ages but there is a mystical age there's another one it's in there but you got to look for it and it has to be revealed to you because we didn't know that there was an eighth day somewhere but the Bible says it Leviticus calls it and then the holy convocation that means there's another place how are we gonna hide people you and I must realize him and this whole world is getting ready to go up and frame we don't have an ark like Noah we don't have nothing to cross over I don't care if you got a a spacestation the Bible said the heaven and earth is gonna be set on fire where is my place of refuge is that right come unto me all ye that are late and heavy laden and I'll give you rest is that right Solomon said he's a hiding place he's a secret place everybody can't see it like Cain couldn't see his refuge everybody can't see their refuge they think science is their refuge hallelujah but there is a hiding place there is a refuge is that true organization stop that I refuse my organization that's the same way Israel thought when when Titus and the rest time came they thought because I'm a Jew Jerusalem is my place and this is a holy city this is the holy denomination God started this denomination and they didn't even realize that God had departed they had become a kebab because God had departed because of their transgressions hallelujah and they closed themselves up in the wall and guess what they all died there they ended up eating each other's children and everything else and then when Titus McGann finish with them the Bible said the blood was flowing from the how horses brow they fail to see as a nation where their hiding place was but there was one thing hallelujah that caught the vision two thieves on the cross hallelujah the one thief he ridiculed like Oh Israel oh cars Jesus hallelujah but there's one who was ordained who knew amen that this man is a special man I love to say it like this here he was standing there and they're hanging down on the cross he knew he was guilty for something in him men knew he didn't mean to do it he got caught up in his sins hallelujah but he says now inspired it's nobody's fault but my own hallelujah but this man is the innocent lamb this man is innocent hallelujah and they had written there the King of the Jews I love this revelation he said King of the Jews he says I'm a Jew that means he's my king and guess what is his love me me me this is what Jesus said this day you shall enter into the kingdom hallelujah you will be with me in paradise this day what was it he knocked on the door and Jesus opened it it was no hard words all he had to do is accept that Jesus Christ was to save you know somebody had mercy and God opened the door wide open for word hmm if you believe this message in the simplicity God will open the white door wide open to you all you got to do is believe that the door is open for you hallelujah is that right oh listen but this ain't all hallelujah when we escaped when we were born and birth into Christ there was another City because you got to understand that the only City the real city is Jerusalem not the natural one the one that God builds hallelujah you got to understand him and we're not look listen if Jerusalem was the place I needed to be I bought me a ticket and go just now hallelujah if that was my hiding place huh oh come on somebody but listen there's another Jerusalem they meant for everybody it's only meant for those who's elected and God has justified and so they never seen in the first place guilty as charged amen but we've escaped hallelujah why because the jury the judge the attorney all of them were the same when he threw the case out Satan tried to accuse us but how their head and already wrote it he says they no weapon formed no matter what Satan and try to Cruz you are Amen we have a god that already don't wipe the slate clean somebody help me because there are times you not think things that we all not to think we do think that we ought not to do we say things we all not to say but thank God I'm in Christ hallelujah and when you are in Christ you're safe take that one devil we used to sing that song amen hallelujah about done satyrs bad and I'm so glad he missed this so he thought he had imma close here I got a stop but listen the the New Jerusalem is eternal peace eternal safety hallelujah is that right the Bible tells us though I got things I wait I'm gonna stop there see there's there's a there's a translation and when I say a translation I mean God has has taken us and he's placed us in a dimension where Satan can't get to is that right Jesus said it you believe this he says the son of man is here on earth and he's there too brother Brennan was behind the curtain of time says you're here and you dare to put us in a place of safety already my soul is in safety already your soul is in safety no matter what the devil tries here the case is already thrown out he has no evidence i'ma have to close here but you see you better be on the run if you're not in there yet you better be in the run cuz those wolves those Devils whatever they're after you they only say places in the arms of Jesus let's tan we'll finish this up Sunday evening by God's grace but I'm gonna read the scripture to show you that every city is in the scripture as their 967 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God hallelujah fellowship and everything the Prince of Peace yes the principles of the increase of the government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with the justice from his forth even forever the zeal the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this you said what do you mean brother their times you get tired brother you get tired you get tired and you think to yourself oh lord help me y'all know what I'm saying you think those runners they get tired they got tired and God still was so old the enemy up because the man was ordained to get behind the wall some time God has to slow your enemy up he would really devalue if he could but God's is not on not this one lord have mercy I feel so good I don't know what to do because you and I must understand we got to with ordained to escape I'm so thank God that God is you know God don't depend on our thoughts or what we think he's ordained is that right Peter Peter didn't think much of himself and God made it made it happen did you know that think about it a man who did not Christ three times Amen is now to preach on a Pentecost and on the day of Pentecost but God had to move him out the way he had too much of Peter he had too much of him and man he thought it was this and that he thought he could handle it and God wiped him out God had never been able to use Paul with nothing he wouldn't never been useful to God if God would have just took him in that intellectual way even Paul Paul was Paul saw whatever you want to say he this is a smiling man come on y'all how can you not be prideful you you you you you know studied under millions and you straight-a student can you not be puffed up a little bit your notable saying it had to be quite humiliating for Paul to stand there and preach Jesus if he had been in his natural man he would have never done it but now that he's born again tell you what addictive fear out of you you
