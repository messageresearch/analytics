[0:14] right into the word of
[0:19] God Amen we're going to be coming from
[0:22] Isaiah
[0:23] 26
[0:27] amen I've had so many people sharing
[0:31] all and thought I I'll share a few
[0:34] things kind of implemented into my
[0:36] message for tonight we studied this last
[0:39] night and my I just thank God for the
[0:43] Holy
[0:44] Spirit uh because the Holy Spirit no
[0:47] matter where you are you can be in Japan
[0:49] and he'll give you the same message you
[0:52] know and I believe with all of my heart
[0:54] by the grace of God that's how Paul came
[0:56] to know things that he did not would not
[0:58] have known and not he went out in the
[1:01] desert and fellowship and commune with
[1:03] God and then he came out there knowing
[1:05] more than the rest of
[1:07] them you see that's how it is with God
[1:10] and that's how it is in this day he's
[1:12] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15] he's a God that changes not amen last
[1:19] night we uh in Bible study we we
[1:23] preached on the secret coming and
[1:24] catching away amen and uh I just believe
[1:28] with all my heart uh you can't be caught
[1:30] up you can't catch up or CAU be caught
[1:33] up until you catch
[1:35] up and there's a lot of people that need
[1:37] to catch up so they can be caught up
[1:40] amen so we thank God for his grace as we
[1:43] read Isaiah 26 and 20 and from there
[1:46] we're going to go to First Corinthians
[1:49] Isaiah
[1:50] 26:20 you love the
[1:56] Lord for whatever reason I want to trans
[2:00] expose these
[2:02] numbers
[2:04] 2620 come my people enter thou into thy
[2:09] Chambers and shut thy doors about thee
[2:13] hide thyself as it were for a little
[2:17] moment until the ignoration be
[2:21] overpassed I'm sorry we're going to read
[2:23] one more scripture
[2:25] Joel we're going to throw Joel in there
[2:28] by the grace of God Joel
[2:37] two Joel
[2:43] two I believe God is God is trying to
[2:46] tell us something amen Joel 2:16 let's
[2:50] read 15 blow ye the trumpet in Zion
[2:54] sanctify a fast call a Sol a
[3:00] assembly now you got to realize what
[3:02] that's all about gather the people
[3:05] sanctify the congregation assem the
[3:08] elders gather the children and those
[3:11] that are suck the breast let the
[3:13] bridegroom go forth of his chamber and
[3:16] the bride out of her
[3:19] closet 1 Corinthians 2
[3:24] and5 you got to go in before you can
[3:26] come out
[3:34] First Corinthians 2 2
[3:42] chapter getting at the fifth
[3:46] verse that your faith should stand not
[3:49] or not stand in the wisdom of men but in
[3:52] the power of the Holy Ghost how be it we
[3:56] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[4:00] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[4:03] the princes of this world that come to n
[4:07] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[4:10] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[4:13] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[4:17] which none of the princes that would
[4:20] princes of this world knew but had they
[4:23] known it they would not have crucified
[4:27] the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I
[4:32] have not seen nor ear heard neither have
[4:36] entered into the heart of man the things
[4:39] which God have prepared for them that
[4:42] love him now watch this but God have
[4:46] revealed them unto us by his Spirit now
[4:50] here Paul picks up the scripture amen I
[4:53] have not seen and ear have not heard
[4:56] amen he picks that up out of Isaiah 64
[4:59] and4
[5:00] and then Paul comes along excuse me and
[5:03] Paul comes along and pick up what Isaiah
[5:05] says but then he modifies it or he
[5:07] brings it up to his date and he said but
[5:10] God have revealed them unto us now as
[5:15] have not seen ISS have not heard but
[5:18] Paul said yes it is it is so now right
[5:22] God but God have revealed them unto us
[5:25] by his spirit for the spirit searches
[5:28] all things yet
[5:30] the Deep things of God for what man
[5:33] knoweth the things of a man say the
[5:35] spirit of man which is in is in him even
[5:39] so the things of God knoweth no man but
[5:44] the spirit of
[5:46] God now we have received here it is now
[5:51] we have received not the spirit of the
[5:54] world but the spirit which is is of God
[5:58] that we might know

[7:16] seated Lord's
[7:17] willingen thank God for his gra thank
[7:20] you brother
[7:25] Hallelujah we like to uh just start off
[7:28] by the grace of
[7:30] God uh with a a few uh historical things
[7:34] things that are happening right now uh
[7:37] you know in our life and in our world
[7:39] today we know by the grace of God that
[7:42] we're living in the end time because God
[7:44] has given us description of the things
[7:46] that we ought to look for famine
[7:48] earthquakes pestilence Wars rumors of
[7:51] wars and we all know these things and
[7:54] right now I I was uh text uh several uh
[7:58] textes today uh one came from uh Ohio
[8:02] where uh and they showed us that uh they
[8:05] in
[8:06] Oklahoma amen uh they there's a group of
[8:09] people that want has a a unveiling plan
[8:13] uh to unveil the statue of Satan and
[8:17] they want to put it right there on the
[8:18] state yard amen where the Ten
[8:21] Commandments
[8:22] are yeah yeah you can go look it up and
[8:26] it's amazing because Satan is becoming
[8:30] Bolder and it's the same kind of image
[8:33] that the Illuminati and all of these
[8:35] people
[8:36] worship Hallelujah come on somebody and
[8:40] at the same time we see you know uh
[8:42] overseas and uh that that's being
[8:45] bombarded by storms well look at America
[8:49] look what look what's happening to us I
[8:52] mean and look at our nation it's just a
[8:53] matter of time uh before all this rain
[8:57] and snow and water shake things are
[8:59] loose for
[9:00] us uh you know but yet and still we find
[9:03] that this is a time where you know I was
[9:06] talking with the brother that you know
[9:08] we not only can see the evil but we can
[9:11] also feel it on a daily basis the
[9:14] pressure of it you know the Mind battles
[9:17] that uh we we have has become so uh
[9:21] intense far far far uh beyond what it
[9:25] was a few years ago and so we realize
[9:28] you're going to either live or die sink
[9:31] or
[9:33] swim amen that's it there there there
[9:36] are no middle ground when there is no
[9:40] Purgatory I you know don't want to
[9:42] disappoint you but there is no Purgatory
[9:45] that God is going to send you to you
[9:47] either make heaven or make hell amen and
[9:51] so we find out by the grace of God Amen
[9:54] that this is a time and you know brother
[9:55] brandom said we can live so close to God
[9:57] that God will take us places
[10:00] and that's what I'm pressing and trying
[10:02] to press into that that I can live
[10:06] so with God because remember the prophet
[10:10] of God said the Holy Ghost must must
[10:13] live in you
[10:16] supremely that that that's something
[10:19] folks he said the Holy Ghost must live
[10:23] in you
[10:24] supremely that means he must I'm talking
[10:27] about Rapture material now in order to
[10:30] make this Rapture so let us not fool
[10:32] ourselves the Holy Ghost must live in
[10:36] you
[10:37] supremely now let me put it this way if
[10:41] he doesn't it is not his
[10:44] fault it is only our fault because
[10:47] whosoever will see God will never Force
[10:51] this thing on you but think about it
[10:54] here God and and I love this because I
[10:56] don't want you to panic and say oh my
[10:58] God I'm going to make it because if if
[11:00] you true seed God will make sure you
[11:04] come to maturity now you some of us
[11:07] might have to come the harder way but
[11:09] God is going to do it amen is that all
[11:12] right now we're living in a time and we
[11:15] find out that you know this is one of my
[11:17] favorite chapters and that is Psalms 27
[11:20] but we find out I'm just going to turn
[11:22] there quickly Psalm 27 I don't want to
[11:25] mess it up
[11:29] psalms 27 everybody all right amen now
[11:33] we find out by the grace of God Amen in
[11:35] Psalm 27 and and one now this is not
[11:40] just David talking but this is the
[11:42] inspiration of the Holy Ghost he's
[11:45] trying to get a message over to the
[11:48] people and and this is what he says one
[11:51] thing beginning at the fourth verse one
[11:53] thing have I desired of the
[11:57] Lord that will I see seek after you
[12:01] can't just lay still and not do anything
[12:05] I will seek after that I may what dwell
[12:08] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[12:11] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[12:14] and to inquire in his Temple now you
[12:17] must understand David is not talking
[12:19] about the manmade
[12:22] Jerusalem David amen is speaking about
[12:25] amen that new city that new heaven that
[12:28] that new place that God is is preparing
[12:31] for us he said I I have one
[12:33] desire that is to live wherever God is
[12:37] living now he goes on said but in the
[12:40] time of
[12:42] trouble he shall hide me in his
[12:48] pilion that means God is going to have a
[12:52] Sheltering
[12:54] Place amen for you and
[12:57] I in the secret place of his
[13:04] Tabernacle right in the secret place of
[13:07] his tent shall he hide me he shall set
[13:10] me upon a rock and understand what that
[13:15] means set me upon a rock means that he
[13:18] will give me a revelation that when when
[13:21] the storms come remember Jesus said who
[13:24] is the wise man the one who builds his
[13:27] house upon a rock
[13:29] when the winds comes when the storms
[13:32] come and beat upon the house the Bible
[13:34] said the house will not fall because
[13:37] he's built upon a rockl what rock the
[13:41] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[13:44] is hallelujah come on now we working
[13:48] with something right now because you
[13:50] know it's really difficult because
[13:52] sometimes we fail to see that we say we
[13:55] we become Antichrist when we deny that
[13:59] Jesus Christ want to live live in our
[14:03] flesh Hallelujah come on Amen the Bible
[14:06] said if if you can't believe that's John
[14:10] that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh
[14:13] you're
[14:15] Antichrist let this mind be in you that
[14:17] was also in Christ Jesus amen rightall
[14:21] amen so you got to believe that Jesus
[14:24] Christ want to live in your body not
[14:27] just for a moment in
[14:29] well
[14:31] F your Tabernacle he want to live
[14:34] through you walk through you talk
[14:36] through you he wants to do everything
[14:39] through you and you and I must come to
[14:42] realize amen this is the ultimate
[14:46] go oh my God I love the Lord why because
[14:50] he's made it so simple it is the seed
[14:54] that's in you that comes to Perfection
[14:57] not your flesh amen
[15:00] amen but that seed in you amen is that
[15:04] second Adam and that second Adam knows
[15:07] how to sedo the
[15:09] Earth put your flesh under
[15:14] subjection Hallelujah come on somebody 1
[15:17] Corinthians 2:5 Paul goes on to say that
[15:21] your faith should not stand in the
[15:22] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[15:26] hallelujah it ain't good enough Amen to
[15:29] know the message per se we need the
[15:32] power of the message Hallelujah we need
[15:35] the life of the message come on somebody
[15:38] that's what God is saying we're not
[15:40] resting Hallelujah I I I think somebody
[15:43] when when the the healing brother said
[15:46] thank God for the heal uh the Healer the
[15:48] healing is good but thank God for the
[15:50] Healer amen because the healer is a
[15:53] savior he's a deliverer hallelujah
[15:57] hallelujah that means he can do
[15:59] everything Hallelujah that we need him
[16:01] to do now we're living in a day and I'm
[16:04] going to tell you something even among
[16:05] ourselves you know you get we've got put
[16:08] it this way you and I Must Be watchful
[16:12] of the spirits that will anoint us the
[16:16] leodan spirit is loosed the spirit of
[16:19] scoffing is loosed the spirit of
[16:21] murmuring and complaining is loosed all
[16:24] of the spirits that that defeated amen
[16:28] Israel coming out of Egypt are still
[16:31] alive if you're going to put it that way
[16:33] they're loosed and they're here to
[16:36] anoint the Bride of Jesus Christ you
[16:38] said that can't be true it is true
[16:41] because the word of God said when the
[16:43] bottomless pit was open brother brand
[16:46] said the the the lid of hell has been
[16:48] open it's been taken off amen and so all
[16:51] those Spears from the anti-an day what
[16:53] what day the day before
[16:55] Noah right all those Spirits have been
[16:58] loose and they've been loosed on the
[17:00] Bride of Jesus Christ and the devil say
[17:03] you ain't got nothing Hallelujah he's
[17:06] got to pull all hell out to try to stop
[17:09] you and he can't do it why because the
[17:12] Lord Jesus himself amen whipped H
[17:14] Hallelujah and the grave Hallelujah he
[17:17] took all authority and power from the
[17:20] devil so if the devil don't have no
[17:22] power then how can his demons have
[17:24] any amen it's only what you allow them
[17:27] to do with your own own
[17:30] mind Hallelujah you can give them
[17:32] Authority that they don't even have by
[17:35] allowing them in your mind to have
[17:38] authority the Bible said he was stripped
[17:40] stripped of all authority of all power
[17:44] Hallelujah and the Bible said he led
[17:46] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[17:48] man amen oh my scoffers the Lord
[17:53] delayeth his
[17:55] coming oh well you know ain't nothing
[17:57] happened since the Lord fell asleep
[17:59] ain't no change and what they don't feel
[18:02] what they don't see amen is that
[18:04] Darkness can't comprehend
[18:06] light Hallelujah come on somebody and
[18:09] that's what you and I must be careful
[18:12] that we're not walking in darkness
[18:13] because if the light is shining you will
[18:16] not comprehend it when it comes that's
[18:18] why you got to stay in the light walk in
[18:21] the light live in the light Hallelujah
[18:23] so that we may
[18:25] comprehend first Thessalonians 5:5 say
[18:28] you are not all you are all children of
[18:30] light and the children of the day we are
[18:33] not of the night nor of Darkness
[18:36] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[18:39] but let us watch and be sober for they
[18:42] that sleep sleep in the night and they
[18:44] that be drunken are drunken in the night
[18:46] but let us who are of the day be sober
[18:49] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[18:52] love you know faith and love are
[18:55] twins right you can't have one without
[18:57] the other
[18:59] Hallelujah and for helmet the hope of
[19:02] salvation for God have not appointed us
[19:05] to wrath let's say that God has not
[19:08] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[19:11] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ say
[19:13] it but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[19:16] Jesus
[19:17] Christ amen so when the devil say you
[19:20] going to hell quote him that Hallelujah
[19:23] bring the word back to him God is Not
[19:25] pointing me to wrath Hallelujah but to
[19:27] obtain salvation
[19:29] by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us
[19:32] that whether we are awake or asleep we
[19:35] should live together with him oh whether
[19:39] we be awake or sleep come on somebody
[19:41] but here it is wherefore Comfort
[19:44] yourself together edify one another even
[19:48] as also ye do this is the hour we're
[19:51] living in the hour of edifying each
[19:55] other y'all hear what I'm saying I need
[19:58] you you need me Hallelujah we need to
[20:01] learn how to edify one another and if
[20:03] you're not feeling up to Park call
[20:07] somebody don't let the devil whip you
[20:09] Hallelujah that's the anointing that
[20:11] we're living in like the prophet of God
[20:13] said if there's ever time the Bride of
[20:15] Jesus Christ should be clish this is the
[20:18] time they going to call us a cult
[20:22] anyway they don't realize he man there's
[20:24] Baptist Cults Methodist Cults Catholic
[20:27] cults yes yeah they Cults
[20:32] everywhere yeah come on somebody and
[20:35] they look at us and say well y'all cult
[20:37] we look at all these other ones and like
[20:39] I tell people if you define the cult the
[20:40] way I've heard being defined amen
[20:43] following the man then the cathic church
[20:45] is the biggest cult there
[20:48] is hallelujah is that all right now the
[20:52] word of God comes along and says now
[20:53] listen therefore you know for God is Not
[20:56] appointed us to wrath but to obtain our
[20:58] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ is
[21:00] that all right oh my goodness but let's
[21:03] move on to St John 58 I've got a lot of
[21:05] scripture and stuff Marvel
[21:08] not at this for the hour is coming and
[21:13] now is when the dead shall hear the
[21:16] voice of the Son of God and they that

[21:33] heard him amen therefore if you heard
[21:36] his voice the Bible said You shall
[21:41] live Hallelujah well I heard William
[21:43] brand that wasn't William V Brandon's
[21:45] voice that was God's voice you can you
[21:48] got to hear it you got to hear that a
[21:50] voice in a
[21:52] voice oh come on somebody I I'm enjoying
[21:56] this now but I I'm I'm I'm I'm going to
[21:58] shift gears here in a bit 1 Corinthians
[22:04] 15:51 because I don't believe that the
[22:07] put it I don't really believe that the
[22:09] message or we as a message people or
[22:11] group of people that say we following
[22:13] Malachi 4 really see how blessed we
[22:18] are above all
[22:20] measures nobody could have educated you
[22:23] into this it had to be revealed that's
[22:26] why you and I follow this thing no
[22:29] matter how much ridicule we got we can't
[22:32] help it we heard the eagle scream and we
[22:37] know who our father
[22:38] is see we can't help it and and I love
[22:42] that I love that amen because I can't
[22:44] help myself and no matter how many times
[22:47] I fall short I still run back to Mom and
[22:54] Daddy amen 1 Corinthians 15:51 oh the
[22:58] devil is so mad and he's doing
[22:59] everything he can do to stop this
[23:04] Rapture Hallelujah just like I said you
[23:07] got to take away the Roman seal
[23:10] Hallelujah you can't allow yourself to
[23:12] be sted you can't allow yourself to be
[23:14] cold come on somebody you can't allow
[23:17] yourself to be in a state of
[23:19] comos Hallelujah Hallelujah you got to
[23:22] make some motions in here you got to do
[23:24] something you got to contend for the
[23:26] faith and like I said when you contend
[23:28] for the faith you're not contending for
[23:30] just the letter of the word you're
[23:32] contending for the power of God which is
[23:34] the quickening spirit amen because

[30:34] when you persecute Jesus people when you

[30:43] Jesus and when God came here amen so we
[30:46] can understand people well well I'm

[31:48] last Trump oh my god oh Jesus have mercy
[31:53] and we realize now I don't I don't know
[31:55] how true it is but I believe it you know
[31:58] uh the the the uh
[32:01] uh it have to bring it back to my mind
[32:04] but the the prime minister of of Israel
[32:06] that's in in in the coma now and now his
[32:08] body is deteriorating all right and they
[32:11] had a prophecy by this Renown H uh uh
[32:17] Theologian uh he was a priest uh uh one
[32:20] of Israel great leaders in the teaching
[32:24] and you know he he he he had visions and
[32:26] he went in and out of them and and he he
[32:28] revealed to Israel some years ago amen
[32:31] that that Jesus was the Messiah that was
[32:34] after his death and he prophesied that
[32:36] when when uh s Sone amen when he
[32:41] died that's when God will reveal himself
[32:45] to the Jews now just in the last few
[32:48] weeks his body has been shutting down on
[32:52] him if this prophecy is true and we know
[32:56] God had revealed to this orthodox Jew
[32:58] that Jesus Yeshua was the true Messiah
[33:02] they thought something was wrong but
[33:04] they proved his handwriting was
[33:07] correct now if that be the true how much
[33:10] time do we have left because when God
[33:13] reveals himself to the Jews the pride is
[33:15] already
[33:18] gone it's that much time time
[33:24] left remember folks it's a secret C in

[49:24] a woman with child and they shall not
[49:26] Escape shap but ye Brethren are not in
[49:30] darkness that that day should overtake
[49:32] you as a thief there is no excuse if we
[49:37] miss the Rapture is our own fault
[49:39] because we chose to walk in darkness
[49:43] rather than light and the Bible said if
[49:45] you choose to walk in darkness the Bible
[49:47] said men love Darkness because their
[49:49] deeds are
[49:52] evil oh come on somebody

[50:57] how many of y'all know we on a
[50:59] pilgrimage huh when you're on a
[51:01] pilgrimage it's not easy you think about
[51:03] those pilgrims that came all the way
[51:05] from England all the way over here on a
[51:06] a a a strange voyage and didn't even
[51:08] know where he was going there was no
[51:10] stop sign no stop lights there was no
[51:11] road maps no nothing the only thing they
[51:14] had was a
[51:15] compass H oh my something struck me all
[51:19] I got is a compass and that's the North
[51:21] Star hallelujah amen that star amen
[51:25] keeps me alive with the
[51:29] word oh my listen what he says in Israel
[51:33] in
[51:33] Egypt he said oh Jacob in dying standing
[51:37] before Pharaoh he said I have been so
[51:39] many years in my pilgrimage amen what
[51:42] was it what was he he began to come to
[51:45] himself listen he began to come to
[51:47] himself the little fell had done so bad
[51:51] he knew that he was only a pilgrim here
[51:54] now notice we come on down down to the
[51:57] eth verse and God promises Abraham here
[51:59] how he's going to save him and his seed
[52:02] after him now he made the Covenant
[52:05] unconditional it isn't just exactly what
[52:08] uh that he made it just because you know
[52:11] and I thought about I said Lord look at
[52:13] Abraham he messed up he did so many
[52:17] things
[52:18] wrong God knew it God knew Abraham was
[52:22] going to do everything he did
[52:24] wrong but what did God do rewarded him
[52:28] for the things he did
[52:32] right he got the king in
[52:35] trouble you see what I'm saying amen and
[52:37] you you you he didn't even separate from
[52:40] lot like he should God had to raise up a
[52:44] battle and God then when he comes to his
[52:47] son then God rewards him like Abraham
[52:49] has done everything perfectly right and
[52:52] in the eyes of God he did
[52:54] amen right see he made the Covenant
[52:57] unconditional it isn't just exactly uh
[53:00] that uh he made it just because he was
[53:02] Abraham now Abraham if you will do this
[53:05] if you will do that he said Abraham I've
[53:08] done it already it ain't nothing you got
[53:11] to do I've done it myself amen oh my
[53:14] when I think of that God did it himself
[53:18] unconditionally God Covenant is
[53:21] unconditional you say well brother I I
[53:23] quit eating meat I don't do this brother
[53:26] don't have one thing to do with it did
[53:29] you know Amen in oh amen how God says he
[53:34] said when that uh Holy Spirit uh begins
[53:38] to
[53:39] fall it will bring us to a
[53:42] Perfection I just listened to the
[53:44] message
[53:46] today but my point is what we fail to
[53:50] see it's the word it's the spirit that
[53:51] Quicken it's the anointing that breaks
[53:53] the Yoke I don't care how much words you
[53:55] hear you want don't allow the anointing
[53:57] in your life you will be dead letter
[54:00] knowing the word but
[54:02] powerless you got to have the anointing
[54:05] to be
[54:07] powerful the Holy Ghost is the power of
[54:10] the
[54:13] word and we got so many people amen that
[54:16] knows what he says but it's
[54:19] powerless it isn't whether you eat meat
[54:22] and don't eat meat or keep Sabbath days
[54:24] or new moons or whether you go to Sun
[54:26] school on Sunday or what it is this is
[54:30] you know it won't be no jealousy in
[54:31] heaven but God knows when I get up there
[54:34] I want some
[54:35] rewards I don't want to be the least in
[54:37] Heaven you
[54:39] no th those people that do nothing be
[54:42] the least you get there but your your
[54:45] your your outfit would just be
[54:48] plain now I know you say it it won't
[54:51] matter but why if it doesn't matter why
[54:54] does God make the difference
[55:01] some people going to have a lot of
[55:05] Stripes you think everybody going to be
[55:07] dressed alike brother R tells you that
[55:10] even those people amen that came running
[55:12] to him was dressed in different
[55:16] garments you going to have priests
[55:18] prophets Kings all of that and they will
[55:20] all have different garments but yet
[55:23] holy oh come on somebody sure really
[55:26] study your message then you'll know but
[55:29] you know the difference is there won't
[55:31] be no
[55:34] jealousy there won't be no jealousy
[55:37] nobody will be there amen wanting to be
[55:40] me they'll be so glad to get
[55:43] there y'all hear what I'm saying you say
[55:46] oh I don't understand the whole concept
[55:49] of it but why would God say to brother
[55:52] Brandon because you have chose the hard
[55:54] way
[55:56] and your choosing is correct the right
[55:58] way I have given you a huge por he
[56:01] didn't say a large large is that good
[56:04] but
[56:05] huge a huge portion when you think huge
[56:10] it's
[56:12] huge everybody don't get a huge
[56:18] portion y'all hear what I'm saying but
[56:21] because of who he was because of the
[56:23] work he did he chose and every every one
[56:26] of us must
[56:28] choose the harder
[56:32] way is this okay folks and if you say
[56:36] brother you have no desire of nothing of
[56:38] the world and your whole heart centered
[56:40] on that you can't keep away from it but
[56:44] as long as there's a tug there you know
[56:46] there's something wrong
[56:48] yet now y'all hear what I'm saying now
[56:52] yet uh now election God called Abraham
[56:55] told him he was going to to save him
[56:56] unconditionally now let us go over here
[56:59] after the promise of and got got a
[57:02] little later I want now he goes on and
[57:04] say but he says now listen you're not
[57:06] where you're supposed to be if there's
[57:07] still a
[57:12] tug oh my let's move on I don't know
[57:16] what time it is I don't want to keep you
[57:18] too much longer but my point is this I
[57:20] haven't even read some of the things I
[57:22] want to read but let me read let me read
[57:23] a few more quotes here so because I
[57:25] don't want to forget is we're coming in
[57:28] a time and I'm going to just run through
[57:29] it Israel Israel was was tried right
[57:34] remember in Deuteronomy he says and thou
[57:37] shalt remember all the ways which the
[57:38] Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in
[57:41] the Wilder to Humble thee to prove thee
[57:45] to know that what was in thine heart
[57:48] whether thou would keep his commandment
[57:50] or no and every test and trial we have
[57:54] is God proving us
[57:56] amen and we if we make it he he sees
[57:59] where we desire to love do his word if
[58:03] we falter he see we're not there
[58:05] yet but every trial amen and test we go
[58:09] through God is trying you right amen now
[58:14] listen the Bible says according to
[58:16] Psalms 37:39 but the salvation of the
[58:19] righteous is the Lord he is their
[58:24] strengthen in time of trouble so if you
[58:26] don't have him you won't have strength
[58:30] in time of trouble amen let me read that
[58:33] again he is their strength in time of
[58:37] trouble and he cannot be something
[58:40] you've imagined it must be a reality he
[58:44] said in that day you know I'm in the
[58:46] father of the fathers in me I am in you
[58:48] so it must be that's the only way
[58:57] listen what the prophet says know the
[58:59] ones at the end time till it would even
[59:01] be so real he said the the the two
[59:03] between the false I'm saying these
[59:05] things because we're not just working
[59:07] with worldly stuff we're working
[59:08] spiritually here too he said till it
[59:10] would even be so real till it would
[59:13] deceive the very election possible now
[59:16] how you going to How Did we tell it in
[59:18] them days how you going to tell it today
[59:22] the same way stay with the word Jesus
[59:25] Christ the same yesterday today and
[59:27] forever now care all this message and
[59:31] when you listen to the tape even maybe
[59:35] I'll be gone someday when the Lord's
[59:37] finished with me here on Earth you refer
[59:40] back to this listen to my voice what I'm
[59:43] telling you if he takes me before his
[59:46] coming just remember I spoke to you in
[59:49] the name of the Lord by the word of the
[59:53] Lord yes notice be so close together
[59:57] that
[59:58] would that would deceive the elected if
[1:00:01] it were possible what do the signs the
[1:00:05] same Miracles by The Same Spirit would
[1:00:08] do the same sign same Miracles by The
[1:00:11] Same Spirit is that right just like the
[1:00:14] prophets was that you just we just
[1:00:16] talked about prophets now also written
[1:00:20] let's turn to it in in uh uh this one if
[1:00:23] you want to Second Timothy three let not
[1:00:27] leave this one and I don't want to I
[1:00:30] look at the clock up here okay I want to
[1:00:32] ommit a lot of it and I I don't think we
[1:00:34] should do it
[1:00:36] now if I'm
[1:00:38] standing here first faring like I I see
[1:00:41] I am but I'm happy and I know that this
[1:00:44] is true Paul the man who said if an
[1:00:47] angel come from heaven and speak any
[1:00:50] other word to you than that which I said
[1:00:55] let him be cursed not an angel come down
[1:00:59] right now an angel come down right so he
[1:01:02] said he goes on and he says now but what
[1:01:04] what is brother Ram trying to tell you
[1:01:06] he said I preach the same message Paul
[1:01:08] preached and if Paul said it I can say
[1:01:11] it stay with what I said and if anybody
[1:01:14] else come preaching differently let him
[1:01:16] be a
[1:01:19] cursed that's
[1:01:22] powerful so is that all right now let me
[1:01:25] let me let me go on cuz I want to hurry
[1:01:27] up quickly my when my father and my
[1:01:30] mother forsake me then the Lord will
[1:01:33] take me

[1:02:13] own come on somebody and you must
[1:02:16] Realize by the grace of God you can't

[1:02:21] the Bible said those who have friends of
[1:02:23] who is a friend of the world is God
[1:02:28] enemy you know why because your friend
[1:02:32] of the world is going to get you to

[1:03:08] me the Lord will lift me up right cuz if
[1:03:11] you looking at a good picture you going
[1:03:13] you going to Bear
[1:03:14] it you going to work it you going to
[1:03:16] watch it right your body will say go to
[1:03:21] sleep but it's so good you looking at it
[1:03:22] just act like you're looking at a TV
[1:03:25] amen the unfailing
[1:03:28] word God still remain true to his
[1:03:31] word because you got to realize we're
[1:03:33] looking at something that's going to
[1:03:35] cause us it's what we call Brother call
[1:03:37] us the squeeze squeeze you know who who
[1:03:41] who who who betrayed Peter somebody that
[1:03:45] was once a church
[1:03:48] member she was there she said I saw you
[1:03:52] you were there you're one of them she
[1:03:53] could identify him
[1:03:57] y'all hear what I'm saying and Peter got
[1:03:59] out of that by swearing and cursing like
[1:04:02] a
[1:04:04] sinner right so that he could separate
[1:04:06] himself oh come on somebody and think
[1:04:09] about this the whole time he was doing
[1:04:12] that he failed to see that Jesus was
[1:04:14] looking right at him and when he caught
[1:04:17] the eyes of Christ he was oh you can't
[1:04:19] imagine I can imagine how he felt but
[1:04:22] I'm going to tell you something every
[1:04:23] time we do wrong Jesus is standing there
[1:04:25] looking at us
[1:04:29] God who can create squirrels who can
[1:04:31] take away tumors he's still the same God
[1:04:33] tonight for it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:04:36] yesterday today and forever you believe
[1:04:38] that heavenly father who is my witness
[1:04:40] with this uh uh this Bible over my heart
[1:04:44] know that word by word of that is true
[1:04:48] as I know how to say it what good would
[1:04:51] it do me to say something wrong friends
[1:04:54] what am I saying this for that is my
[1:04:57] encourage you to believe now that gift
[1:05:00] that great gift other others I tried to
[1:05:02] explain and say how it was done this
[1:05:05] can't be explained now just wait it will
[1:05:09] not be in operation so perfectly now
[1:05:13] wait till the Council of churches bring
[1:05:15] on the persecution see he says listen he
[1:05:19] said now don't get discouraged about
[1:05:20] this thing because really you cannot
[1:05:23] make it happen but God has designed
[1:05:26] this thing to bring you to Perfection
[1:05:28] like he did with the Hebrew boy he set
[1:05:31] the fire up seven times harder
[1:05:34] Hallelujah so this Perfection that God
[1:05:36] is going to completely bring us into
[1:05:40] that will bring forth the translation
[1:05:42] and I'm not saying amen that that we're
[1:05:44] not where we should be but my point is
[1:05:47] God has designed this thing to full is
[1:05:50] like when the challenge come when The
[1:05:52] Showdown come amen the Mount Zion
[1:05:55] Showdown down come amen that's when the
[1:05:57] Bride of Jesus Christ will show her
[1:06:00] color right amen we wait till the
[1:06:03] counsil of churches bring on the
[1:06:04] persecution that's when it'll happen
[1:06:06] that's the reason I come back among you
[1:06:08] to pray for the sick I have never had
[1:06:10] one but but one thing that he ever told
[1:06:13] me in my life that I know that hasn't
[1:06:16] happened yet that same sort of a
[1:06:18] building or tent where there be a little
[1:06:20] building setting and I have to go into
[1:06:22] that and pray for the sick that hasn't
[1:06:24] happened yet as as far as I know that's
[1:06:26] the only thing that I know and when he
[1:06:29] says those words to say it the heavenly
[1:06:31] father knows that I stand here tonight
[1:06:34] and he would kill me right here in the
[1:06:35] platform yes sir he certainly could do
[1:06:37] it and I know that I I'm well aware of
[1:06:41] that can I read on and I know there's so
[1:06:44] many stories today I ain't responsible
[1:06:46] for them I'm only responsible for for
[1:06:48] that what I say I've got to answer for
[1:06:51] what I say and that is the truth and the
[1:06:54] heavenly father knows that is the truth
[1:06:56] now will you believe Jesus Christ the
[1:06:59] son of God died for your sins and was
[1:07:02] wounded for your transgression with the
[1:07:04] stripes you were healed do you believe
[1:07:06] it in this day when just look like
[1:07:09] everything is black and dark and dull
[1:07:12] but yet Jesus remained the same you know
[1:07:15] I can read a quote overseas like this
[1:07:18] and they'll be screaming and
[1:07:21] shouting it's true and I wonder I
[1:07:23] thought I think sometime we a lot of us
[1:07:26] don't scream and shout over the
[1:07:29] word and when a quote come understand if
[1:07:32] it's connected to the word do you know
[1:07:34] what God is doing to you building your
[1:07:38] faith we don't get excited but it should
[1:07:42] excite
[1:07:43] us right amen I know I've been long and
[1:07:45] I'm I'm going cut it short but don't
[1:07:47] y'all go out there and stand another 30
[1:07:49] minutes
[1:07:50] now no y'all do what you want to do I'm
[1:07:53] just messing with you but you know what
[1:07:55] I'm saying it it's time for Fellowship
[1:07:57] then that's okay do you believe that he
[1:08:00] he's here tonight I want somebody to
[1:08:02] rise and tell me anything I ever spoke
[1:08:04] in the name of the Lord besides that but
[1:08:06] what happened and how many hundreds of
[1:08:08] times that you've seen him say it it's
[1:08:11] never did fail what I'm trying to tell
[1:08:14] you it's totally impossible for a human
[1:08:16] being to do that it's Jesus Christ among
[1:08:20] the people is Christ among us today
[1:08:23] denominations are saying come in here
[1:08:25] comeing come there it's the old trend of
[1:08:28] some school or something which is
[1:08:30] perfectly all right it has to be there
[1:08:33] it's part of the symphony but to me he's
[1:08:35] a living tonight just as powerful and
[1:08:39] strong to make every word real that he
[1:08:42] did back
[1:08:49] there I read one more quote and I'm
[1:08:51] going let you go later in you

[1:11:25] amen amen we we we realize tonight amen
[1:11:30] that there's coming a change but like I
[1:11:33] said by the grace of God you know there
[1:11:36] got to be more out of
[1:11:38] us let's suppose no I won't I just say
[1:11:42] it like this it's got to be more God is
[1:11:45] asking for more you said I'm giving all
[1:11:47] I got maybe
[1:11:50] so or giving all I can give but I think
[1:11:54] if we could all think about that
[1:11:56] statement it wouldn't be true we're not
[1:11:58] giving all we can give and if we were
[1:12:01] God wouldn't be calling for us to give
[1:12:03] more you know it's like it's like any
[1:12:06] any coach you know and I I've seen it
[1:12:09] happen you know even even myself when I
[1:12:11] was in high school you know uh out there
[1:12:13] on the football field and you feel like
[1:12:15] you got to die you going to die from the
[1:12:17] Heat and everything else come on hit it
[1:12:21] again I mean he he's driving you and
[1:12:24] pushing you and and literally you doing
[1:12:26] it something you thought you couldn't do
[1:12:30] cuz in your mind you've already limited
[1:12:32] yourself and that coach is to break is
[1:12:35] to drive you beyond your limits walls
[1:12:39] that you placed in your mind that's how
[1:12:42] records are
[1:12:43] broken because somebody decides in their
[1:12:46] heart and their mind I'm going
[1:12:50] Beyond right and I'm saying by the grace
[1:12:52] of God people we are living in
[1:12:55] a day that it's hard for me to explain I
[1:12:59] just know what I go through on a daily
[1:13:01] basis and I know if I go through
[1:13:03] something y'all got to be going through
[1:13:04] something too you know I wish I could
[1:13:07] truly say that every day I come home my
[1:13:09] my day is hotti hot and never goodby
[1:13:11] hallelujah praise the Lord you know I
[1:13:13] try to stay in that atmosphere I do but
[1:13:16] it doesn't stop the devil from
[1:13:18] coming right he's still going to try to
[1:13:20] break the force
[1:13:22] field yeah he's still going to try to
[1:13:24] penetrate that that right amen so what
[1:13:26] happens is sometimes you you get to a
[1:13:29] place and you think you say well Lord I
[1:13:31] you know you get weary in your flesh
[1:13:33] y'all know what I'm saying not so much
[1:13:35] weary in your soul but weary in your
[1:13:37] flesh and when you get weary in your
[1:13:39] flesh here come the devil right he knows
[1:13:42] exactly when the attack you right but we
[1:13:45] fail to see when we get weary where to
[1:13:48] go one touch from the Lord he can he can
[1:13:52] equate to you eight hours of sleep by
[1:13:55] One
[1:13:57] Touch ain't nothing impossible for God
[1:14:00] he quickens us people and we must learn
[1:14:04] by the grace of God to to get next to
[1:14:06] God follow him with all of our heart our
[1:14:08] mind our soul I'm not done with this but
