TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's just start by reading Proverbs 23:7 just the first portion of that and we'll take and move on finish this tonight Lord's willing amen Proverbs 237 for as he thinketh in his heart so is he that's just read that portion again for as he thinketh in his heart so is he let us pray father God we come before you right now we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your love Lord we pray that you forgive us of all of our sins and our shortcomings Lord and we'll be grateful Lord grateful Lord gratefully to praise you Lord and testify of all the great things you've done and is doing for us Lord help us Lord here tonight bless us we pray as we surrender our hearts our minds and our souls to you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I started off this morning amen showing uh by the grace of God uh where civilization had taken us or has taken us and I showed you how uh all of that though be good is evil too uh so much so that it won't even be in the new civilization amen and so we thank God Amen because if this is a faith civilization the one that we're going to is a faith civilization as well and um I read here in the power of transformation it says see how that the serpent seed went off into science education cities and music and great things in education and Science and so forth but the seed of the righteous one uh uh uh came back to the word I just kind of uh uh paraphrase that a small portion there but that's what he said you know he said a lot of other things but he brought it right back down to uh the seed of Eve and he said that Eve did not have a seed so that was God's seed so and it came back and he brought it back Amen to the point where the Bible said Seth amen when he was born uh men began to call upon the name of the Lord see because that was in the seed it's in the seed to worship God Amen you hear what I'm saying so when that seed was born that seed couldn't help itself it had to worship God amen the true and living God because it was the proper and correct seed is that all right then amen I was reading here how that the civilization built uh uh is built up to its Pinnacle now in other words am mean this civilization has come to its point and we've got death in this civilization we got sin in this civilization we've got sickness in this civilization and that can't be of God so God in in in the uh his great own kingdom that is to come will have a civilization but it'll not be anything like this amen one of the things I wanted to show you this morning I think I kind of left out but I wanted to show you how this transformation take takes place brother brandom said and he used the word I used the tple he said that tple when it is born it looks like a catfish but that catfish when it begins to transform it drops his tail and it turns into a frog amen amen to look at the Frog and look at the tple you'll never uh believe or even know that it was the same creature but that's the kind of transformation that God Amen is looking at of course we're not transforming into a frog we're going far beyond that by the grace of God but he used that as a scenario so that we can see that there's a a total outward change and character change amen right because the tap pole can only live in water but the Frog can live in water and on the land is that right so we're looking at this so we understand by the grace of God that this scientific civilization he goes on to say it'll be a faith Civilization by the word see the scientific civilization we have is all is is ex have excuse me uh the scientific civilization we have is exactly listen Satan an's trap and that's what he's killed the people with that's what he's killing us every day with that's how as we eat day instead of living we die they have so perverted everything to even they take just so much of this and mix it with this and hre this and that and that it till it's a dying it's a dying race and no matter what you try to do you'll die you see seen the picture last night of those Africans they never had penicillin them people live longer than we do they don't even know germs don't bother them see why a germ would throw up his hands and surrender at them I like that they don't why they haven't you see all been uh uh working with he talking about this hybrid stuff so when you and I can see by the grace of God that this stuff is basically killing us so in order to live we got to get something that's going to cause us to live right all of us can be a witness to that amen that this thing amen is killing us I don't care how much amen you physical exercise vitamins amen you can you can close yourself in a bubble and you'll still die amen this civilization has built up as they say a pin it cannot be of God by the grace of God is killing everything is that right amen so but we know by the grace of God that God has something special for us amen he's got something good for us if we can just have faith in God now let me read on one of the things I didn't want you to do I don't want us to so frat like oh my God I'm going to miss the Rapture like I said amen a sheep can never be sheepish it is what it is or two sheepish rather amen it is what it is it's going to bore the character that it is so when it comes to the saints of God let me put it this way I don't care what you think and what I think God's word is the thing or the cause of who we are and what we are today if God did not come by to stir you if God didn't come to anoint you you if God did not if he would not come to change you all of us would still be out there in the world Amen because we have come to know that we did not seek God God sought us oh come on somebody God interrupted every one of our Lives Amen to bring us to this truth and the one thing that I love about it is that God has never lost one hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody you might be at the head of the line but I might be at the back of the line but I'm still in the line amen hallelujah come on somebody he might have to scream to us stay in line get back in line but we in line hey somebody I felt that one am amen so when you look at this you and I must understand that we're working with the God of Peace amen is that right when that wig one came a revelation 10 is that right when he came by the grace of God Amen the Bible said his eyes was like the flame of fire I mean he looked like he was really upset oh my God but he was not upset with his own he came to redeem his own but judge the wicked see because God knew that he his own would repent amen that's where our Victory is it's in Repentance amen that's why Revelation 3 says be zous to repent people of God because God knows that his people will repent it doesn't mean you won't do wrong but he knows you're going to repent from it thank God for that amen now he says Amen in Romans 16:20 and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly come on somebody the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you amen that wasn't just for the Romans that's for you and me God knew that his seed would come in this day and read the very same word because his thoughts about the church yesterday is the same thoughts for today amen and it cannot change is that right I can't tell you how often I have to repent during the day and ask God to forgive me during the day and you know uh come on somebody Hallelujah you know and I mean I mean it's just amazing the battles that we're going through right now you say oh brother Brooks the battles are great I'm so glad you said how can you be glad yes it's painful my daughter just had a baby hallelujah oh my God but she said when she delivered that baby all she could do is say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen amen and they was telling me about one of my daughters when she had her baby she told the doctor she told the doctor I'm going to die the lady said you're not going to die she said yes I am I'm going to die but you see amen that pain was making her feel that way amen but what she failed to see momentarily she wasn't dying she was literally bringing forth life and right now you might feel like the pain is feeling bringing you to a death and you might die but that's not what's really happening God is producing life amen he's bringing life out of you yeah is home yes it's painful Hallelujah anxiet all these things fight your mind but you're pushing Hallelujah you're bringing forth the head Hallelujah which is Jesus Christ himself Oh Glory to God he's a God of Peace God is not angry with you amen amen oh come on somebody if he was angry with you you'd be out there come on somebody God is the God of Peace is that the word amen now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ that great Shepherd of the sheep why you put Shepherd of the sheep so that you understand he's leading through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant not I got you you're Sav today and you're not Sav tomorrow this is an unconditional Covenant amen so rest in Christ amen oh I love this make you perfect in every good work to do his will that is a process to complete and what has been broken he's going to fix it Lord he's going to make you perfect in every good work to do his will amen working in you say working in me amen working in me working in me amen that which is well pleasing in his sight through through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen that word means so be it amen hey Lord working in me working in you Hallelujah he's going to do it he's doing it right now oh the pain thank God for the pain amen cuz if you was dead you wouldn't feel any not in the body anyhow amen glory to God see the birth of the word is truth I love that when the Bible you see I may have read that quote many time where brother brandom said our parent is the word but when I was studying that thing looked like a new a new dimension opened to me Hallelujah you know you know the eaglet that little eaglet amen didn't realize it was a eaglet or Eagle until he heard the scream but when I when I heard that I heard the scream Hallelujah I heard something you know something went off I'm like there it is amen it ain't about me it's about him in this clay God in this clay not me is God in the clay that's what made me it was a human life in this clay that made me human but now it's a God in this clay that'll make me a god hey Lord have mercy it's simple as that and what I got to do be faithful in feeding when Papa and Mama want to feed me I just got to eat right amen eat all your vitamins eat your food and you'll turn out to be a healthy boy and girl right that's the way it goes because the life in itself is going to produce his life am this is powerful you'll never see another tree nurturing a tree and just throw the seed out there this is good stuff amen he throws the seed out there and everything that that seed needs is right in nature amen everything in the earth he don't have to worry about whether it's going to grow because Mom and Daddy tree done proed that the ground was good yeah Hallelujah so the seed goes out amen and the water the rain the Seas and everything that Mom and Daddy had to go through that tree got to go through amen that baby tree has to go through but the life has already been proven Hallelujah the stamina of the tree it's been proven that Mom and Daddy tree y' understand what I'm saying amen he can believe that he's going to be grow up to be a great Oak cuz he can see the ones that around him Hallelujah and so is it with the True Believer the seed may have been thrown but it fell in good ground amen that'll bring forth aund fold God will cause the seed to grow amen have you ever thought about this a lot of us we want to just run real fast don't we but have you ever thought about it that we've got a slug because there's somebody else left yeah Hallelujah if we could run as fast as we desire to run the Rapture will be on Amen but God sometime he have to slow us up a little bit H he has to he has to slow us up a little bit that's why some sometimes famines come in that's why droughts or whatever the case may be may hit certain thing because and and during that period amen it'll slow you up the growth but then after a while a real rain will come Hallelujah and you are you you've grown overnight Hallelujah that's the way God works sometimes even in our lives amen hallelujah amen so when we look at this he make you perfect in every good work to do his will this is what I love about it because understand I love this I've always watched those little animals a horse a deer and the first thing they do when they come they they they a they first learn how to stand and then the next thing they they do after they stand they go for the Mama come on somebody amen they go to be nursed by the mother how did they know that they didn't go to school we're the only lame creature per se not the only ones but we got those like monkeys and all that that needs to be fed that way but when we are born we have to be so taken care of almost every other animal finds their way but we're the ones that have to be so taken care of mama got to come you got you know it it just amazing and that's how God is when we're born he so take care of us hallelujah even when you cry and think he's not far away he's right there watching amen sometime he gives you Grace to exercise your lungs that's the truth that's the truth folks amen you look at that and God is right there to help you is that right now I want you to understand because a lot of times You Feel So Unworthy but I'mma change your thought about this right now Hebrews 11 oh Lord have mercy you got to realize amen that this thing is by faith right you've got something that the world don't have now the world may have faith in all this whatever they call Faith but you got Jesus the faith of the Lord Jesus in you right now here the word of God tells us in Hebrews 11:38 think about this and I want you to really think about this the scripture says of whom the world was not worthy who was he talking about us those who've gone on before us and Who We Are The World is not worthy of you that means you're worth something amen the devil say you're not worth it anything but the Bible said you're worth far more so much so this world is not worthy Hallelujah that's right the whole world is not worthy of you oh yeah they wondered inde deserts and the mountains and dens and caves of the Earth but what this world didn't understand was those who wandered were those who were there in the beginning created with God created in God am I said created with God but y'all me know what I mean when Jesus Christ was created am Hallelujah hey amen there was a part of him that was Hallelujah come on somebody if that part wasn't created it would have never died but when he was created so were you you were in him amen and the world is not worthy of you but they look at like you're the scum of the earth ain't nothing to you oh Lord I I I say sometime man if the people when they mistreat me I said if they only knew who they was mistreating every time I get on the plane they should put me in first class hallelujah amen if it was some Royal president or something there put him there Hallelujah but that's okay our day coming amen amen so look look the world is not worthy and I'm I'm I'm saying because if the if you the world is not worthy that means you're something amen now we're not to be allowed ourselves to be puffed up with pride but we are supposed to know who we are amen amen took upon himself no reputation but he thought it not robbery to be equal with God this is the mindset the bride must have amen you must have this is that all right let us turn to first Thessalonians 5 because I want you to know amen that the Bible said every good and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights are you a good and perfect gift yes I am if you're not you well I thought that was listen the the the the perfect gift was Jesus Christ and I was in it amen hallelujah the father of lights and the Bible said ye are the lights of the world Amen is that right but look what 1 Thessalonians 5 says let me get that so you can understand first 1 Thessalonians 5 5 ye are are the children of light amen that means if light going to have children the only thing it can produce is light amen God is light amen there's not a two lights there's only one light amen and I'm part of that amen that's why brother R said that the Holy Ghost was a you know you were a a rotation off of God in other words God pulled a piece of himself and gave it to you amen broke a piece that's why he broke the bread yes amen oh Lord when I think about that see my point is this you got to believe what you are before you can be what you are huh you got to believe what you are before you can be what you are see and once you believe that nobody can take it from you amen you know I tell you like this Bruce Lee you know this is a a natural thing he was one of the smallest Fighters I ever seen in my life but there wasn't a big fella could whip him why because he had to believe in his heart he could whoop him though they were big in size he was bigger in man right and that's what I'm saying David had believed something amen when he faced Goliath he could not have the same mindset his brothers had that's right amen he could not allow himself to run as a coward in other words he defeated fear by running into the problem instead of running from the problem that's how you defeat fear you run into it amen you don't run away from it you take the challenge and you challenge it amen by the same words amen Goliath challenged David David took the same words and brought it back to Goliath amen hallelujah come on somebody it's still good to me now I look at this thing because if we are the light that and there Darkness tell me at any point anywhere any time Darkness defeated the light you can cut all this whole building all the lights off get you a flashlight and I guarantee it'll be seen somehow it penetrates through all that Darkness nowhere matter what point of the room you're in you can see that light that's how it is in the spirit world yes amen that's how in the spirit world that's how come the devil can recognize you because of the light that you have oh yes I've had mediums come up and tell me so my point is this people of God Amen they can see your light might as well tell you like this you need to start seeing the light amen your mindset out the way we think the way you know you know we've got to learn to to to really set only those things before us that are pure and that is Holy and that is good and that is righteous things that like a the word where we can read and study and you see what I'm saying and you know bringing this thing to us the mirror of the word and I I put down and I thought that's right we must become the mirrors of the word in other words we are person or individual must be able to see the word in us we must reflect back to the word what it has what it's given us in other words amen everything that they said about Jesus was able to be found in the word amen hello somebody he met the word by every Dot and by every tile he met that word amen and so therefore he was blameless because he met the word he said can you find any fault he said if if I'm not doing what the scriptures have said that I would do then you can find you you got me he said but but if I am he basically say shut up that's basic what he was saying because you see he understood he hadn't missed God by one point he was right there see and worldly people can call you Fanatics they can call you holy rollers and all you got to do is tell them say show me where in the scripture I'm not meeting God's criteria show me where I'm going wrong if you can't show me zip it right because amen we are the reflection of the word listen it's not a pride it's not an arrogance it it's it's just an assurance amen they said that this man who give him authority to teach the word like this see he had an authority and when you are certain of who you are it gives you the authority to use the word you know who you are you know your relationship ship with it you're not some study student you the word reflecting back to that word is here is in our minds we've got to learn to change this to can I use brother brand example brother B said I ain't got nothing to brag on he said my daddy was a drunkard my mother was a half Indian my family had a bad name he just was going down the road he said I was born of brandom that's where I was born he said there was nothing to brag on there now what if this man would have allowed his past to keep him from his future not like like Moses did I'm a mess Lord I done messed up over there in Egypt huh I'm oued out like a murderer I can't hardly talk and you telling me that I'm a deliverer you see what I'm saying how how the contrast that God allows all these Wicked worldly rough things to happen in your life and then he brings a lily up out of that pond mud see that's the whole plan that's the whole plan to show Satan no matter how dark you made it for them it's the seed that conquers everything it's what's in them that I have placed in them that will conquer you oh God think about it if the prophet had allowed that to hinder him he couldn't because there was something in him that was driving him they say oh brother brandom that thing that you got is be of the devil he said can't be I love God too much he ran from it Hallelujah then God Amen perfect in his power and in his understanding amen one day stepped out of a pillar of light oh see God protect Tak his gifts amen and if you don't know that God has protected you thus far you in trouble CU every last I I won't say every last one of us but I can say many of us have had death encounters and God brought us through them all what was it it was the gift it was what what was in you Hallelujah that was protect he was protecting amen he couldn't let you go you got work to do amen come on somebody listen even you don't think you're going to get tired even on this journey you get weary huh yes you get weary but you get weary in your natural jobs but you know you still got to show up so is it in your spiritual you get weary at times this flesh get weary your spirit get weary the battles are so great and intense than everything else but guess what you still got to clock in see still got to show up cuz if you don't show up he's coming by your house to find out what the problem is y'all never seen God do that you sitting up here in the church and the Lord walk down right down the aisle and knock on your door and open it up and say I see you in there don't be like my like I did when I was a boy my mama the insurance man came by the door by the house and and and my mama say tell the insurance man I'm not home I went to the door I said mama say she ain't at [Laughter] home guess what I got a whipping whipping because I didn't tell the LIE right oh Lord have mercy on us but nevertheless you see what I'm saying it would be exposed but I look at this stuff and I think to myself Lord have mercy what we've gone through this life but God is rich in Mercy amen amen we becomes the mirror as the scripture says according to James 1 123 for if any be of a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass we're not supposed to hold our face because understand this it was only in this age the face of the Lord Jesus was revealed amen he said we'll see him face to face huh and then James said it'll be like a mirror in other words he's saying when you see my face you see yours the body has one face and that is the face of Jesus Christ come on somebody only one face so when you see his face you see yours wo somebody ought to be happy tonight to know that we're seeing the face of God and that's the way we look amen perfect than amen our lives are heing in Christ Jesus that's a beautiful scripture to me amen man every time I think about that I think about Levi being in the in the Lawns of Abraham his life with he and Abraham and all of Abraham's blessing Levi got it come on somebody and that's how it is with Jesus Christ all of his blessings we get it amen why because we were hid in him 2 Corinthians 3:18 said but we all with open face open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord a chain change into the same what image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord we're being changed from glory to glory don't all happen at one time little by little but we're being change into the glory and the image you've got to believe it anybody believe it I believe it oh can you see it brother I don't care if I can't see it I believe it Abraham walked with God is that is that right amen amen amen and yes we do have to suffer sometimes Romans 8:18 I'm going to read that quickly we have to suffer sure we do amen glory to God and the Bible said but I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US think about it think about it think about it just like I read this morning ain't no way that baby going to want to go back into his mother's womb no no no no no he might have thought he was coming into a mess amen especially when the first expression he the first thing he feels amen oh my God what am I coming into Hallelujah and understand he don't come in here seeing he comeing here not seeing amen so at little by little amen his eyes began to open up amen all of a sudden you see the baby start smiling wonder what he was thinking before he started seeing but you know nevertheless amen you look at this thing and and he can now see he sees a face that he he he knew was mama all along but now he can see who Mama looked like oh oh we can we don't have no idea the joy that fills a baby Soul we can't even remember it but I guarantee you it must be wonderful when this baby can't even recognize but he understands I am in a better place now oh Lord have mercy Abraham never altered his thought and the seed of God never Alters thought Rapture I am amen I'm going to produce Jesus Christ how you know God said so amen well you look like you're getting older Abraham I am but I'm still going to produce Jesus amen cuz God says so amen y'all hear what I'm saying amen it's in my appointed time and God going to produce it amen I want to say something to you that may even look look look a little strange or sound a little strange but Abraham believed God all those years and then here come Elohim himself sit down at Abraham's tent and tells him now Abraham it's time to fellowship with your wife because nine months from now amen I know I'm looking stupid but I'm feeling good amen you think about I I think about things like this not saying it's going to happen like this but what if God does come what if he says he comes to you individually and says okay it's now time to do this this this because so many days from hence this is going to happen am he did it to Abraham he did it to Abraham in the natural amen the Bible said we're Children of the light am we're not of Darkness this thing will not catch us unaware amen hallelujah there's something God is hiding in here and he's doing something amen and let me tell you something the bride feels it amen but I believe by the grace of God she's going to have a personal encounter with God before leaving out of here hallelujah amen glory to God see he's perfect I love the way he he does things I just it's just something that he he moves me W Lord have mercy and when Abraham was 90 years old you know and that's the thing about a people we look at Enoch and like you know Enoch was always perfect huh how could it be Enoch walked with God Enoch wasn't always perfect he walked with God put it this way the prophet of God had walked With God all those years you know been with God seen God but one day at the time of a storm God said can I walk with you he he has the prophit can I walk with you see but all along he had been with him but this was the first encounter that we know of God actually walks with him enjoying the creation this was the first time that we know of that God says to him you've come to that place I can walk with youall you did something that pleased me even though it looked like your death you didn't run from the storm you face the storm I told you to walk to through it you did I told you to speak through it you did it amen you see what I'm saying that's the test every test watch the Hebrew boyss they didn't run from it watch Daniel they didn't run from it they walked right into the storm knowing it was going to be their death if God had not answered and that was the thing that pleased him please God obedience ain't God good to us let me hurry Psalms and I 82 and6 says I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high then Jesus comes along in John 10:34 and quotes it again Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said ye are Gods huh he said I said ye are Gods I said ye a gods look like they would have caught it for in him we live according to Acts 17:38 and move and have our being you see why I'm saying this because when you start thinking like this amen you know what people going to call you a cult you going to believe that you a cult there's only one God hallelujah I know that and that one God is living in me amen no I'm not saying I'm separate from God but we going to Stone you man because you make yourself equal with god you being a man make yourself equal with God you being a man make yourself equal with God and you think that accusation is not going on still and understand by the grace of God you do have Cults that literally be believe that they're being transformed into Gods the New Age movement and all of that but all that is folks is just a mimic of the truth amen you got to recognize where you are we didn't ask to be God we didn't strive to be God he made us that amen it was Lucifer who wanted to be that and God said no amen see because the only one that could be a God is those who comes out of the loins of God Amen and Lucifer was not a seat of God see what I'm saying but that's what he wanted we didn't ask for it no more than you asked to be a man or a woman God gave it to you so is it amen as a son and daughter of God God gives this to you it's a gift it is he God in you right and then in Acts 17:38 says for as much then we are all the offspring of God we ought not to think that God is like unto gold or silver or stone or Graven by Art in man's devices we don't be little God understand he is God Amen created of all things the invisible God but visible to us because we see him on the inside he said in that day you'll see me you'll know me amen like I said I told you you don't see with your eyes you see with your mind have I been on time with you Peter philli and you don't even know me when you see me you see the father he wasn't talking about his physical Anatomy he was talking about the works and the things he did amen amen being born again right 1 Peter 2 1:23 says being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible seed that mean it can't be corrupted amen that's why the Bible said if that seed remaineth in you you cannot sin amen oh Jesus amen excuse me is that all right amen by the word of God listen we make mistakes but we can't sin there is not a true believer that could ever disbelieve the word huh you mess up because of the sticky of this flesh but if we didn't have this flesh we'd be perfect already that's why we make it right this whole thing right here got to go it's got to be changed to with the Redemption of your body everything has been redeemed but your body amen but I tell you what has happened to your body has been condemned huh is that the truth I'm laughing you know I'm laughing it gives me joy amen we triy so hard to fix this house up and it's still condemned before God it's condemned we got a condemned side on it oh Lord have mercy All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of the of man as the flower of grass that's the truth all this stuff people work so hard for in one moment's time it's vanished the grass wither and the flowers thereof follow the way but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you you it endure forever it endures forever they say they they say that even scientists can catch the real real voice of Jesus Christ It Never Dies think about it amen so this holy ghost that we have by the grace of God it causes us to Triumph second Corinthians 21:14 say thanks be to our god unto God which always causes us to Triumph in CAU let me read it again which always causes us to Triumph in Christ it's a win-win amen there's no way you can leave out here a loser right because of his Victorious life you are victorious hey he causes us to Triumph oh I made it I did this I didn't do nothing he caused us to Triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place it's all about about Jesus I'm almost done just give me a few more minutes here see because I want you to understand war is pain and you in a war don't ever think you're not in a war the moment you think you're not in a war you're going to get hit with something you are in a constant battle every day amen anybody know what I'm talking about amen amen you fighting the devil sometime and then you're fighting yourself sometime and then you're fighting both of them amen amen it's always that way that's why I wish the I wish we when we kill our flesh it could just stay dead but it resurrects with you every morning you got to kill it every day amen all that Holy Ghost and yet you got to kill it every day in order for the Holy Ghost to be effective in your life amen oh my I understand what David say sweeter than the honey and the comb see I be tasting the word up here I don't be preaching I'm tasting it I heard brother Brandon preaching the uh yesterday and he go I'm like oh I know that feeling that is good amen something strikes a spirit taste in there and it just that's all you can do is make sounds like that for thou oh Lord thou Lord H has made me glad through thy work I will Triumph in the works of thy hands amen I will and see that's the way David David you got to say it like that I will Triumph no matter what I'll come out victoriously you did it the works of your hand and I will Triumph you got to agree with the word amen the word hallelujah and everything God speaks concerning you is amen you don't have to feel it smell it taste it or see it amen you just got to amen it with all of your heart believe believe it with all of your heart it'll come to pass come on somebody that's where you grow right in here Amen in your heartall first Peter 510 but the God of all Grace who have called us into eternal glory by Christ Jesus no it's going to just last here uh uh uh uh only the wicked Glory lasts here our glory is eternal it just doesn't stop here in time and space it goes into eternity Glory by Christ Jesus after ye have suffered a while and he doesn't tell us how long that while is but I'm going tell you something a while can seem real long folks huh come on y'all know what I'm talking about you can have something come to you and you can be in a tragical accident it seemed like it lasted forever and it could have been just five minutes you ask a woman who's in labor amen that may have gone through a few hours it to her it feel like eternity almost forever forever and that's the way it makes us feel look like we've been pushing a long time look like we've been just laboring a long time Lord have mer you know it just seemed like you know it just you know and there is a time and you know what it's always at that time when that woman can't feel like she can go any further that doctor say now it's time to push is that right sisters it's true that's when he said push and I see my sisters and stuff they be shaking their head I can't I can't and he saiding push hallelujah thank God is that right then what happens them Angels come y'all call them nurses but those angels come and they help lift you up in the back to help support your push come on somebody amen they help you that's why God got it like that to show you even when you come to your birth you got some assistance Jacob wrestled with the angel but he came forth amen so you look at this thing he says listen after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthens settles you a process that you and I must go through amen but let me say it like this the whole time you know it's like this it's your mindset is what you believing and thinking in your heart you got to push through all your unbelief because unbel you can't stop it unbelief coming you know doubt comes but you block it you stop it you you speak the word you create a different atmosphere than all of that unbelief comes y'all hear what I'm saying you're light you're light and and think about it if we could see that realm I guarantee you you see the light in the darkness fighting but that light Hold Steady whole steady whole steady you're not going to come through this I'm not going out why because the light that I have was not lit by men amen it was lit by God my last scripture almost Hebrews 1313 let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise you know he didn't say he said sacrifice of praise y'all know what that means sacrifice something's painful something's got to die in order for the praise to come through Hallelujah sacrifice of praise to God continually amen that is what that's what I was trying to say this morning ah the fruit of our lips give giving thanks to his name the fruit of our lips and we fairly see people with fruits lip fruits but he says he looking for them fruits amen continually giving thanks amen oh I hurt my leg Thank God now that doesn't make sense but he said in all things give thanks amen it's obedience amen see if the children of Israel would have given God thanks when he was leading them through the Wilderness they would have taken them far short of a time and all of them probably would have lived but they murmured and complained because they tried to think that they thought that they knew more than what God thought surely God knows better than this this cannot be the way of a true leader that would lead us into the desert ain't no water out here no bread oh what do you do you should have left us over there in Egypt to die y'all hear what I'm saying and that's the way it is you can't think like like God don't know what he's doing God knows exactly what he's doing and guess what it's all about saving you and me it's hard it is tough sometimes but the harder way is the better way people it is the better way now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead of our Lord Jesus Christ that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting covet I read it again make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight working in you that is well pleasing how many of y'all have heard as I was with Moses that's a good tape good message brother BR said God never held Moses accountable for his wrongdoing how he didn't put it that way but he was saying that God does not look at your sin he looks at the commission you see well Moses struck the Rock and he didn't go over that was God's plan because God can't have two prophets on the scene at the same time so Moses had to go off the scene so Joshua could come over Moses represented the law hello somebody but what you don't see what's the difference brother bandam said I went over there and he said I I was over there and they were real I felt him I talked with him and all Moses got up there you don't know what he saw but he was able to look over into the promised land now come on if he was able to look to the promised land all he saw was the river and whatever was there but I believe he's seen it all however God did dealt with him God showed him the promised land you can't show me a house this is your house and don't let me go look in the rooms huh I want to see the rooms in there see and I just somehow believe that God showed him amen the promised land he didn't go there physically but spiritually he saw you said well I don't know about that well let me put it this way he was standing on Mount Transfiguration can't get it no good than that huh you can't get it no better than that right here he was amen he couldn't go over there then but now he's standing on my Transfiguration people of God look at this thing and here God comes along and he does something for you the Bride of Jesus Christ that he's never done for nobody no other age he only took Paul up into that Dimension Paul came back and told him some of the things brother random comes back and he says I saw you there amen amen hallelujah Blessed Assurance amen Jesus is my oh what a for of Glory Divine no other age was able a prophet able to go over and come back and tell them about all the people he didn't go through the mansions and whatever this and that and the streets of gold you know what he came he brought back the precious fruit that which was more precious to God than anything and that was The Souls of the people amen Millions upon Millions were there and they come and says oh my precious brother oh my one more this is it because I want you to understand and you've heard me say this many times judgment begins at the house of God this scripture has come so alive to me because I realize by the grace of God that what I do will affect the whole of De Mo and anching it had gotten down to the point that God held the flood up until it was one man left the whole flood and when he saw that the people w't go repent he saved that one man took him out of here him and his household is that right so you see it was up until that point God don't love destroying people God would that no man would perish he would that all men come into repentance but he know they're not going to do it but he'll work that righteous seed there he'll leave him there as long as he possibly can to give nobody an excuse eight Souls were saved in the days of Noah huh Enoch one huh somebody said well I can't believe you know brother said to Enoch Enoch uh Noah saw Enoch leav and that's when he knew I said thank God for a prophet people said well he wasn't there I said thank God for a prophet I said because God took Noah right there at the day of Enoch he was a prophet he saw him leave he saw him leave in two different times spans he saw him leave just as much as uh Jesus saw um um brother bandam saw ad and Eve amen he knew the wise he knew these Skeptics were looking to there say see he made a contradiction he didn't make no contradiction Noah saw Enoch leave amen now ask God for the Revelation he'll give it to you brother B said whenever it look like there's a contradiction he say seek God there's a revelation and that's what I did and I saw God and God showed me he said Noah was a prophet Hall that's it you know what people said well he made a mistake amen when when he said uh that uh he went up to the Feast of Pentecost he did he so also went up to the Feast of the unleavened bread he hello what's the feast that they said he went up to the Feast of um Passover yes the Passover now let me tell you something they didn't have no vehicles like we do they don't go up to one feast and said well I'll go back home and I'll come back up to the next one they stayed there but that was laid there in the message to trip you they wrestle and do wrestle to their own destruction amen but he stay I I sought the Lord on him he stayed there and that's why brother you think he mentioned Pentecost all those time like he didn't know what he was talking about who was speaking through the man you don't have to answer and say Amen but I know what people think but this is a matter of life and death so people look at it and they say well he made a mistake cuz this is what the Bible says God have mercy I wondered about it too till I sought God you keep what your understanding is until you seek God ask God what he did huh because God laid right there and showed me they stayed there but the feast that God wanted to emphasize was the Feast of Pentecost so but he was there he had to be there he was the word and those feasts were the Feast of the lamb and he had to be there to every one of them and and it was one after the other so you got to realize what was going on but y'all in this day that's why God kept saying it the way he said it he know it was going to stumble some but for that bride it is given to you to know the mysteries of this thing amen see because that's the foundation those are the things that now the critics are actually attacking because they don't understand it they didn't see God for it what you going to say about it cuz you don't see it and no understand it you better understand what a prophet is anyway I don't know why I dropped that in because of your mindset you got to recognize your what where you're thinking right you got to have confidence amen whether I understand it or not I know it seemed like blind leadership but the the the sheeps are so dumb they don't know which way they going anyhow it's only the shepherd amen thank Lord Lord and when you can trust the Shepherd that God and I told a brother this not long ago I said if brother Brandon wasn't the prophet for our age we better find another one quickly cuz time is running out hello and now if he donees messed up we messed up too because if one word brought us into the chaos every word has to be reestablished and so if one word doesn't mess us up and now brother brandham done messed up and go now who where who how we going to get out of this lean not to your own understanding all I'm saying is by the grace of God there's more to this message that a lot of people are seeing amen you know right now God is unveiling it to us showing us amen by the grace of God where you there's a question there's an answer but God gives the answer hallelujah how in the world brother Brandon would have known serpent seed if God had not spoken it to him first amen see if your God our God must speak to you whenever there's a question there there's an answer there somewhere you just got to wait on God to give it there's a lot of things left off the pages you love the Lord amen you got to believe folks you got to have faith am you got to trust this message with all your heart because if if this if this ain't it what we going to trust I mean I mean you understand what I'm saying amen and all you got to do is ask him that's that's what he's there for that's what he's there for to give us understanding of what he's saying and if we're going to trust him we need to trust him with all of our heart not in skepticism or whatever we need to just go forth and say this is what it is you know brother say serpen sced and didn't even know how to back it up at the time he didn't he didn't know how to back it up but he know what the God told him he said it and so you and I must understand by the grace of God sometime we have to say things ye don't don't even understand or even know how to back it up but if you wait on God he'll show you just how to back it up you love the Lord let's stand dear heavenly father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord truly Lord you've been good to us and you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves and father we pray Lord God that you forgive us and cleanse us from all our unrighteousness help us dear Jesus oh God to walk in your way not to add or take away anything from your thoughts give us strength Lord to repent Lord when we find ourselves wrong help Father God to move forward in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen
