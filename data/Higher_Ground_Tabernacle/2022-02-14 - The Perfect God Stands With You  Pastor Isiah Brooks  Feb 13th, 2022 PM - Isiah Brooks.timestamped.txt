[33:50] turn with me to matthew 5 48
[33:54] real simple
[33:56] but to me a powerful scripture
[34:05] thank the lord for my wife being with us
[34:07] this evening and
[34:15] i
[34:17] appreciate uh the word this morning
[34:21] where is the god of elijah
[34:26] ruffin
[34:28] sister rosella
[34:32] and others who were sharing the
[34:35] same season of birthdays we trust that
[34:37] god will
[34:39] continue to bless them and those who
[34:42] came up for prayer
[34:44] is something that when you get prayed
[34:46] for you need to hold fast
[34:52] don't let the devil take it from you
[34:55] we sometimes do ourselves
[34:58] and then we have to start it all over
[34:59] again
[35:01] but thank god for a second chance
[35:05] matthew 5 48
[35:07] and it reads
[35:10] be therefore perfect
[35:13] even as your
[35:14] father which is in heaven
[35:18] is perfect
[35:19] amen let's pray
[35:22] our gracious father we come before you
[35:24] lord as humble as we know how
[35:26] we thank you for being so good to us
[35:29] you have been better to us than we've
[35:30] been
[35:31] to ourselves and
[35:33] lord there is no words to express and
[35:35] every time when i feel
[35:38] uh
[35:40] like it's
[35:41] i've done too much
[35:43] and i've gone too far
[35:46] you always come with the grace and the
[35:48] mercies
[35:50] showing me that there is no possible way
[35:54] that i could go too far
[35:58] because of what you did for me
[36:00] before time began
[36:04] you predestinated us to be sons and
[36:06] daughters of god
[36:09] lord you
[36:11] has given us a confidence
[36:14] and a faith in your word
[36:16] and no one else could have given us this
[36:18] besides you
[36:21] we pray father god for every
[36:23] lost soul or every discouraged soul
[36:27] uh this evening that somehow you touched
[36:29] him through the word
[36:31] bless us now
[36:32] we need you
[36:34] more than we ever needed you before
[36:38] and lord we thank you for your amazing
[36:40] grace i
[36:41] i feel like screaming right now
[36:45] because you've been so good to us
[36:48] we don't deserve your goodness we don't
[36:50] deserve
[36:52] your grace nor your mercy but your
[36:55] loving kindness
[36:57] have sought
[36:58] and seen us thus far
[37:01] it's not him that will it or he that
[37:03] runeth what is you that shows mercy and
[37:06] god i truly understand what that
[37:08] scripture means
[37:10] and i pray tonight that you bless every
[37:12] soul that
[37:13] will anchor our souls anchor our souls
[37:18] in you lord tonight and your promises
[37:21] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[37:24] amen amen you may be seated
[37:31] sometimes we fail to see what faith
[37:34] really is
[37:36] my subject tonight would be the perfect
[37:38] god stands with you
[37:41] i'd rather have him stand with me
[37:44] than anyone in the world
[37:47] because i know that his stand is perfect
[37:52] i'd like to say tonight in starting off
[37:54] the message faith is not some
[37:56] imagination
[37:59] but is as real as your sight
[38:02] your smell your taste
[38:05] your touch
[38:08] it's something that you possess that is
[38:10] so real
[38:12] the evidence is just as real
[38:15] as your sight your smell your taste and
[38:17] your touch
[38:19] but it's only given to you
[38:22] you as an individual when you have faith
[38:25] in something it's been revealed to you
[38:28] it's in another dimension it's another
[38:30] realm
[38:32] something that you can see and
[38:34] understand and
[38:35] no one else can grasp it
[38:38] something that cannot even be explained
[38:40] because in the natural eye you can't see
[38:42] it
[38:44] only you it has been declared to
[38:48] and you know it's real
[38:50] you know it's there
[38:52] like the bible said abraham
[38:56] sought a city
[38:58] whose builder and maker was god
[39:01] and he spent his life on earth looking
[39:04] for that city
[39:06] because he knew it was real yes
[39:09] faith drove him
[39:12] to a place to find that city and at the
[39:15] end he did find it
[39:18] nobody can tell you what you are
[39:21] and once god save you
[39:25] that's such a personal revelation
[39:27] nobody can tell you that you're not
[39:31] what makes it so
[39:33] because it's faith that has been
[39:35] revealed to you
[39:37] and when you know that you've got faith
[39:39] when you know
[39:41] that there is a yearning in your heart
[39:43] for perfection
[39:45] that's one of the greatest things you
[39:46] could have
[39:48] in your heart
[39:50] a yearning
[39:52] to be perfect
[39:54] because if you yearn to be perfect
[39:57] there is perfection for you
[39:59] there is a place
[40:01] where you can't even you can't even uh a
[40:04] place that you you've never seen
[40:06] but you know it's there
[40:09] because we've been taught that this is
[40:11] the negative part of the positive
[40:13] and if the negative is yearning for the
[40:16] positive there's a deep call to the deep
[40:19] there's one to respond
[40:23] your salvation has been declared to you
[40:25] only
[40:27] and no matter how many times people try
[40:29] to tell you that you're not saved you
[40:31] know that you are and there is no way no
[40:34] place nowhere no way to even explain why
[40:38] you believe that you are
[40:40] but there's such an anchor
[40:42] in your soul and no matter how many
[40:45] times the devil tries to take that from
[40:48] you
[40:48] it cannot be taken
[40:51] you and i must know that there is
[40:53] another world there's an unseen world
[40:55] and that's where faith lay
[40:56] lies it's it's it's in a realm of the
[41:00] unseen
[41:01] it's another world that exists beyond
[41:03] this
[41:04] and you know we call it uh uh i said
[41:08] like brother
[41:09] the sixth sense that god has given to us
[41:11] which is that faith connects us to that
[41:14] unseen world
[41:15] that's why the bible says that abraham
[41:18] can call those things that be not as
[41:20] though they were
[41:22] because he understood if there was a
[41:23] desire if there was a yearning if there
[41:25] was a vision if there was something amen
[41:28] that declared what we call faith to him
[41:30] that it was there and it was that when
[41:32] it was real nothing could break that
[41:35] hole
[41:36] so he understood
[41:39] that's the way god created all things
[41:42] he called those things that be not
[41:45] as though they were
[41:47] that's where creation comes in
[41:50] and that's why you and i are little
[41:52] creators
[41:53] because of the holy spirit
[41:56] we can speak things and those things
[41:58] spoken with faith in revelation we'll
[42:01] have to materialize
[42:04] you and i must understand that god
[42:06] stands with us he's not our enemy
[42:09] the bible says that if god be for you
[42:13] who can stand against you
[42:16] coming from a little message
[42:18] brother adam said but jesus lived in a
[42:21] world that no one knowed about
[42:25] he was an odd person
[42:27] he lived in a world of perfect faith
[42:30] in the perfect god
[42:33] in which he was
[42:36] if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[42:38] christian
[42:40] to what we are we'll be a mystic to the
[42:43] world
[42:44] the people wouldn't understand you
[42:47] your walk in the spirit
[42:49] what the spirit said you would do
[42:52] what it forbid you would not do
[42:55] then the people began to say
[42:57] that you you'll be a mystic person to
[42:59] them
[43:00] that's the way it is to all believers
[43:04] they are mystic
[43:06] the people don't understand because they
[43:08] live in a world to themselves
[43:11] jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[43:13] could touch
[43:15] the bibles couldn't understand him
[43:18] excuse me the disciples couldn't
[43:20] understand him and when he spoke to them
[43:22] they say this
[43:24] and then they say why you talking
[43:26] riddles we don't understand this how can
[43:30] this
[43:31] be see they wasn't in the world that he
[43:34] lived in see
[43:35] they couldn't understand him nobody
[43:38] could understand him
[43:40] and so when a man lives by faith
[43:44] and walked by faith i mean substance
[43:47] faith
[43:48] he is so isolated from the entire world
[43:51] and becomes a new creature in christ
[43:53] there's there's see now you're getting
[43:56] into bride material see
[43:58] you're getting into rapturing condition
[44:01] that means for each one of us
[44:04] not just the pastor the deacon the
[44:06] trustees that means for the laity every
[44:10] individual walks in a world with god
[44:12] alone
[44:13] you're baptized into this kingdom
[44:15] and there's nobody in there but you and
[44:19] god see
[44:20] he gives the order and you pack them out
[44:24] hallelujah
[44:25] whatever he says
[44:27] there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere
[44:30] you walk right on
[44:32] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[44:34] the world can talk you out of it you go
[44:37] right on just the same
[44:39] now you're coming into perfect faith
[44:42] perfect perfection that cannot fail
[44:45] that faith never fails yes he wants a
[44:48] mystic
[44:50] he was a mystic to them with his perfect
[44:52] faith and so it is now with those who
[44:55] have faith perfect faith are a mystic to
[44:57] others
[44:59] we taught we are taught to resist the
[45:01] devil and he and he will free from us
[45:04] now to resist is to just simply turn him
[45:09] down
[45:10] just resist him that is just to walk
[45:13] away from it
[45:14] god said a certain thing no matter what
[45:17] he's trying to tell you you don't even
[45:20] listen to him
[45:22] your ears are deaf to anything else but
[45:25] what the spirit says see to he to he
[45:28] that has an ear that listen see what the
[45:32] spirit have said unto the churches
[45:34] the one that got the listings listing
[45:37] post
[45:38] that catches what the spirit says
[45:41] to the churches see this is where god is
[45:44] trying to bring us
[45:45] into such a faith into another ram he
[45:48] said that's rapturing material
[45:51] you see what i'm saying that's bride
[45:52] material when you have come to a place
[45:54] that your faith is so intertwined and so
[45:57] interlocked into that anointing into
[46:00] that dimension amen until you become a
[46:02] mystic to others they can't understand
[46:05] you because when you say god told me or
[46:07] god said amen it is the reality you even
[46:10] though they can't see it see god will
[46:13] always stand with you
[46:15] he's staying with us even when we are in
[46:17] a spirit of doubt and unbelief
[46:20] he'll rebuke you by his word
[46:23] but he'll never leave you nor forsake
[46:25] you
[46:26] matthew 19 21-22 said jesus said unto
[46:29] him if thou be perfect go
[46:32] and sell that hat sell
[46:35] that thou hast and give to the poor
[46:38] y'all know who the rich young ruler was
[46:40] and thou shall have treasures in heaven
[46:42] and come and follow me
[46:45] but when the young man heard that saying
[46:48] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[46:51] possessions and oftentimes when we read
[46:54] that we say yes that was for the rich
[46:57] young ruler but that's for every
[46:59] believer
[47:00] you must sell all that you have
[47:04] and give to the poor
[47:06] you understand you must sell your ideas
[47:09] your thoughts your everything that you
[47:11] think that is of value to you
[47:13] in order to follow jesus christ
[47:16] and remember god never takes anything
[47:18] away from you
[47:19] without giving you something better
[47:23] understand by god's grace that he so
[47:26] stands with us and if that
[47:28] if that rich young ruler had only
[47:32] truly
[47:33] realized that the god who asked him to
[47:36] go sell everything was his creator
[47:40] now the rich young ruler called him
[47:41] master called him lord call him good
[47:44] master and then jesus said unto him
[47:46] there's only one good but god
[47:48] if he could have just only caught that
[47:51] revelation he would have known the same
[47:54] god that made him rich the same god that
[47:56] brought him thus far amen was the same
[47:59] god that would take care of him
[48:01] afterwards
[48:03] but somehow it missed him because the
[48:05] bible says wherever your your your
[48:07] treasures are that's where your heart
[48:09] will be
[48:12] james 1 17 says every good and every
[48:15] good gift and every perfect gift is from
[48:17] above and cometh down from the father of
[48:19] lights with whom is no variableness
[48:22] neither shadow of turning see so you
[48:24] know our uh
[48:26] we know that the perfection the perfect
[48:28] gift comes from the perfect god
[48:30] and think about us each and every ones
[48:32] that have some sort of gift i believe
[48:34] everybody has a gift if it's only if
[48:36] it's just only one but that thing that
[48:38] god gives you is given to you for his
[48:41] glory it is the glorified god
[48:44] now remember jesus christ was the word
[48:46] born the word without without the holy
[48:49] spirit without the quickening of the
[48:51] word that gift that word would have laid
[48:54] dormant
[48:55] but because amen holy spirit came down
[48:58] into him and stood there and said this
[49:00] is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[49:02] pleased to dwell in that word became
[49:05] quick and it became dynamite it became
[49:07] omnipotent it became god
[49:11] and that word was able to be tested and
[49:13] tried and the thing that really
[49:16] really really always strikes my mind is
[49:19] when jesus said unto the serpent said
[49:21] unto that o devil amen man does not live
[49:24] by bread alone but by every word that
[49:27] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[49:33] i often think that
[49:34] that was maybe one of the scriptures
[49:37] that those old saints
[49:40] who were burned at the stake
[49:43] saints a man who was fed to lions and
[49:46] those saints that were actually
[49:48] displayed in herods and all the other uh
[49:51] roman emperor's
[49:53] arenas
[49:55] they
[49:56] knew man does not live by bread alone
[50:00] but by every word
[50:03] and there was no bowing to the to the to
[50:05] the opposition
[50:07] see that's the thing when faith strikes
[50:10] you and you know that you belong to god
[50:12] there is no bowing to the opposition
[50:17] you know that what you have that good
[50:20] and perfect gift that's god
[50:22] hallelujah and it is there's no variance
[50:25] there there's no shadow it's there is no
[50:27] weakness around it through it or in it
[50:30] it is god and when god gives you the
[50:33] holy ghost that's the perfection of
[50:35] perfection
[50:38] that's what we stand on
[50:41] that's the deception that we've we've
[50:43] received throughout the years believing
[50:46] the holy ghost was just a sensation of
[50:48] jumping and shouting and dancing and all
[50:50] of that's good
[50:52] but if the life is not there
[50:54] that's the dynamite
[50:56] when god changes the inside
[50:59] out
[51:01] he changes from the inside out
[51:04] that's the power that which dwells in
[51:06] you when he said you'll know in that day
[51:10] i'm in the father the father's in me and
[51:12] i am in you
[51:13] see it's that life that we need to start
[51:16] drawing from i know i got the holy ghost
[51:18] so these things shouldn't be happening
[51:20] in my life
[51:22] i i heard what the problem the brother
[51:24] said this morning
[51:25] when you go wrong find you a tree find
[51:27] you somewhere to go pray and just drop
[51:29] down with your word and say god forgive
[51:31] me
[51:32] see a lot of times people don't
[51:34] understand that even your healing
[51:37] comes by way of confession that's right
[51:40] that's what brother branham said he said
[51:41] it
[51:42] he said you don't even have to go pray
[51:44] he said most of the time he said people
[51:46] need to go confess
[51:48] and once you confess the devil will move
[51:52] he only holds you because there's
[51:54] something that's not been confessed in
[51:56] you or some you some you know what i
[51:58] mean it could be a
[52:00] a family thing
[52:02] but oftentimes confession is necessary
[52:05] to be healed
[52:08] listen for those that he has called he
[52:10] has chosen and those that he has has
[52:14] called as he justified excuse me and
[52:16] those who justify he's glorified already
[52:19] and when this earthly tabernacle be
[52:22] dissolved
[52:23] we have one already waiting amen for
[52:27] some reason i've been there myself i
[52:30] feel like i gotta do this i got to do
[52:32] that i got to do that and you know what
[52:34] jesus told his disciples and all the
[52:36] ones that believe in him he says have
[52:39] faith in god amen that's what it's about
[52:42] no man can add a cupid to his statue no
[52:45] man amen can achieve anything without
[52:48] god all of our achievements come by his
[52:50] anointing and his anointing is jesus
[52:53] christ himself
[52:56] my thank you lord
[52:59] right in the presence of his being
[53:01] tonight right we have already waiting
[53:04] amen right in the presence of his being
[53:06] tonight in his sight we are already
[53:09] glorified are you feeling that way
[53:14] those who he justified he hath which is
[53:17] past tense glorify
[53:19] and what makes you a christian is
[53:21] because
[53:22] long for you long for that perfection
[53:25] is because the perfection laying right
[53:27] out there
[53:29] that other glorified body and when this
[53:32] one is moved out of you move into that
[53:35] one you understand me i said that
[53:37] earlier but that longing that yearning
[53:40] for perfection that learn yearning to be
[53:42] a christian that yearning to be a better
[53:44] christian that yearning came in to be
[53:46] just like him he you know what the
[53:48] reason is because in that other
[53:50] dimension
[53:51] there's a body
[53:53] paul call it
[53:55] a a body that's
[53:57] made by the hands of god and not by man
[54:01] the word of god tells us of the theophy
[54:03] he said he said if this earthly
[54:04] tabernacle be dissolved i have one
[54:07] made what tabernacle this body
[54:09] i have one and so therefore we know that
[54:11] death is not a part of eternity and we
[54:14] want to move into eternity
[54:16] oh god help us here tonight
[54:18] isn't that marvelous what are we scared
[54:20] about then
[54:23] we just believe and then the master of
[54:26] it
[54:27] all he says all things work together for
[54:29] the good that them love god nothing can
[54:31] harm us
[54:33] just as peaceful as little children
[54:35] playing around we've got a heavenly
[54:37] father who watches over us
[54:40] and whatever he sees
[54:42] that we have neither
[54:44] he just presents it to us
[54:47] [Music]
[54:49] hallelujah talk about resurrection of
[54:51] jairus's daughter
[54:53] he was a man a man who
[54:56] wasn't even a part of
[54:58] of the faith of israel but you know he
[55:02] had a need
[55:04] and he was a ruler and his daughter died
[55:08] and and and jesus awakened him
[55:11] because the man made profound statements
[55:14] i i'm a master i have people under me
[55:16] all i got to do is say do this do this
[55:18] do this see what happened faith caught
[55:20] it
[55:21] and he recognized that jesus was working
[55:23] in a different dimension
[55:25] he wasn't working on the earthly term
[55:27] these natural terms dealing with the
[55:29] elements of this world he he was he was
[55:31] a king from another world and so
[55:34] therefore amen jerry is caught that
[55:37] you know uh that that that understanding
[55:39] and he says lord all you got to do is
[55:41] speak
[55:42] speak the word
[55:46] and i know my daughter will be made
[55:48] whole see
[55:50] and if he's the same like that brother's
[55:52] head this morning he's the same
[55:54] yesterday today and forever like i said
[55:56] earlier faith is not an imagination
[56:00] it's a reality it's a revelation that
[56:02] god gives you personally and no matter
[56:05] what anyone else says you have it and
[56:07] that's all you need to do is work with
[56:09] it
[56:10] or let it work you
[56:13] romans 12 1-2 says i beseech you
[56:15] brethren
[56:17] by the mercies of god that you present
[56:19] your body is a living sacrifice holy
[56:21] acceptable unto god which is your
[56:23] reasonable service
[56:26] and be not conformed to this world
[56:28] but be transformed by the renewing of
[56:30] your mind that you may prove what is
[56:33] that good and acceptable and perfect
[56:36] will of god see what we understand is
[56:39] that
[56:40] living holy and righteous is just
[56:43] reasonable
[56:44] it's what expected of you
[56:47] and you and i must understand that
[56:49] because it's expected it is something
[56:51] that we need to do
[56:53] and desire to do
[56:55] be not we didn't know what the world was
[56:57] who knew what the world was until you
[56:58] got saved
[57:00] yeah we did everything they did we
[57:01] didn't know there was a separation there
[57:03] was a different world
[57:04] there's a world that the christians live
[57:06] in there's a world that the sinner lives
[57:08] in
[57:09] we lived in the sinners world
[57:11] and when god called us like being in
[57:12] egypt when god called us out of egypt he
[57:14] was not expecting us to continue in the
[57:17] habits and things that we learned
[57:20] in egypt
[57:22] we were called out into the wilderness
[57:23] to be sanctified and this is why we go
[57:26] through so many trials so many tests so
[57:28] many fires gold tried in the fire and
[57:31] the reason being is because god is
[57:33] trying to mold us and make us into his
[57:36] very image
[57:38] and what is that image but perfection
[57:42] that we may prove what is that good and
[57:44] acceptable and what perfect will of god
[57:49] god is calling for a perfect being
[57:52] you say oh lord how can i become perfect
[57:55] when i've got so many faults he's not
[57:57] talking about you
[58:01] you put god on a jagged rugged mountain
[58:05] it doesn't change the shape of the
[58:07] mountain
[58:08] but if you put god on that mountain the
[58:10] mountain becomes holy
[58:13] did y'all get it
[58:14] see it's the holy ghost in you that
[58:17] makes you holy not you
[58:19] you and i could never be holy
[58:22] except the holy god be within us
[58:25] what are you here
[58:27] get this in your mind now i'm going to
[58:29] close e but you are here it
[58:32] but what you are here is a sign
[58:35] that you are something else somewhere
[58:38] you always wanted to be imperfection
[58:42] you christians
[58:44] there is a perfection and that
[58:46] perfection is not in this life
[58:49] but every man and woman here that's a
[58:51] that is a christian every person that is
[58:54] a christian here now is already
[58:56] glorified in the presence of jesus
[58:58] christ
[58:59] here you see how the devil is a liar
[59:02] you see how he makes us feel so bad and
[59:04] oh you're so bad you dance you're dead
[59:06] you're hypocrite you're this and that
[59:08] but once you receive christ into your
[59:10] heart you've already been glorified the
[59:12] bible said not who he sanctified the
[59:15] bible said whosoever he justified he
[59:18] glorifies
[59:20] see
[59:22] sanctification will come
[59:24] but glorification comes before
[59:26] sanctification
[59:28] and you've got another body you won't
[59:30] have
[59:32] some other time see
[59:33] you have right now
[59:35] right now there's another body waiting
[59:37] for you if this is one
[59:40] if this one should perish could you
[59:43] think on that see that's what people
[59:45] fail oh if i die what's going to happen
[59:47] to me no i'm a christian
[59:50] a born-again christian
[59:52] a born-again christian
[59:54] i may not be what i desire to be but i i
[59:57] know for certain i'm not what i used to
[59:59] be
[1:00:00] and you and i know we travel somewhere
[1:00:03] listen the bible said he and i love this
[1:00:05] scripture he that begun the good work in
[1:00:07] us is faithful to complete it
[1:00:10] or perform it
[1:00:12] however you look at it it's god working
[1:00:15] on us
[1:00:16] we're not working on god it's god he's
[1:00:18] the we're the he's the potter and we're
[1:00:21] the clay he mows us he makes us he
[1:00:24] shapes us he sends some through the
[1:00:26] water some through the fire y'all know
[1:00:28] the scripture
[1:00:30] hallelujah
[1:00:32] but all through the blood
[1:00:34] all of us must come through the blood
[1:00:38] the blood in itself is the seal of god
[1:00:43] ephesians 4 11 and 13 says and he gave
[1:00:45] some apostles some prophets some
[1:00:47] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[1:00:51] and that's why i try to get people in as
[1:00:53] often as i can whoever i can
[1:00:55] times of getting a little difficult but
[1:00:57] you know whenever i'm led i do what i
[1:00:59] can do
[1:01:00] but the bible said for the perfecting of
[1:01:02] the saints for the working of the
[1:01:03] ministries for the edifying of the body
[1:01:05] of christ
[1:01:07] till we all come into the unity of the
[1:01:09] faith and of the knowledge of the sons
[1:01:11] of god and to perfect man unto the
[1:01:13] measure of the stature of fullness of
[1:01:14] christ
[1:01:16] you know what i can't i can't preach
[1:01:18] like brother isaac i can't preach like
[1:01:20] brother sam i can't preach like brother
[1:01:22] isaiah did this morning i only can
[1:01:24] preach according to the gift that god
[1:01:26] has given me
[1:01:27] but every one of these gifts that god
[1:01:29] has placed in this church is a valuable
[1:01:31] gift because every good and perfect gift
[1:01:33] comes from god
[1:01:34] and understand that those gifts are
[1:01:36] being used in those ways that god used
[1:01:39] them god is perfecting the church
[1:01:43] hallelujah and think about it like it
[1:01:46] marvels i marvel at the people when when
[1:01:48] we have outside speakers coming in they
[1:01:51] don't know them never heard them speak
[1:01:53] and because they have no they don't know
[1:01:54] who they are haven't heard them preach
[1:01:56] they don't come hear them why because
[1:01:58] they don't have a vision
[1:02:00] they don't understand the economy of god
[1:02:03] they listen you say well what do you
[1:02:05] mean god took philip to a eunuch in the
[1:02:08] desert who had no knowledge of jesus
[1:02:11] christ
[1:02:12] and spoke to that man and that man
[1:02:15] became a christian
[1:02:16] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:02:18] christ
[1:02:20] see god can pull people from anywhere
[1:02:24] when he see a job that's needs to be
[1:02:26] done i don't care i was thinking this
[1:02:28] morning if a man came up here crippled
[1:02:31] or bawled up in a knot but could preach
[1:02:33] the word you know i let him preach
[1:02:36] i would
[1:02:37] because it's not the outward appearance
[1:02:38] i'm looking for
[1:02:40] it's a god in that temple that god that
[1:02:43] speaks to clay
[1:02:45] that's what we must always understand it
[1:02:48] ain't always those people that are
[1:02:49] popular
[1:02:52] sometimes it's those like i said earlier
[1:02:54] before before is the no-name preachers
[1:02:58] a lot of them still praise
[1:03:00] a lot of them still fast
[1:03:02] a lot of them still can hear the voice
[1:03:04] of god
[1:03:05] a lot of them have a greater revelation
[1:03:07] because their interest is not fame and
[1:03:10] fortune
[1:03:11] their interest is pleasing god and like
[1:03:14] i said in the early in the message once
[1:03:16] you have broken into that dimension amen
[1:03:19] where you're living in faith you hear
[1:03:21] god and you obey him and he speaks and
[1:03:23] you speaks and he talks and you talk and
[1:03:25] whatever he commands you to do you do it
[1:03:28] and have without any explanation or even
[1:03:31] reasoning other than he told me to do it
[1:03:37] he said is that crazy no every time i
[1:03:39] think about the prophet of god taking up
[1:03:41] some stones and throwing them up in the
[1:03:42] air
[1:03:43] and all of a sudden the whirlwind came
[1:03:45] and
[1:03:46] you know but there was something he had
[1:03:49] to do and those who were there with him
[1:03:51] would have perhaps wondered what in the
[1:03:53] world is he doing now
[1:03:56] but there was no voice
[1:03:57] for him to say
[1:03:59] all he knew was what god had instantly
[1:04:01] said to him he did it he obeyed it and
[1:04:03] and then the whirlwind came
[1:04:06] you see what i'm saying
[1:04:07] it's like taking a piece of stick he
[1:04:10] like elijah
[1:04:11] and throwing it in the water
[1:04:14] and the axe head began to float
[1:04:16] it makes no sense
[1:04:20] you see god will never make sense to the
[1:04:22] natural man but when you are in that
[1:04:24] faith realm he'll make you do or tell
[1:04:28] you to do things that makes no sense to
[1:04:30] the man who's watching
[1:04:32] look at jesus
[1:04:34] what he had to go through
[1:04:37] tabitha dead
[1:04:40] and he walks in and says
[1:04:43] the girl is not dead she's asleep
[1:04:46] and he was the bible said he was laughed
[1:04:49] to scone
[1:04:51] and what did he do come on y'all
[1:04:53] understand me what if god had you to do
[1:04:55] that you really got to be channeled into
[1:04:58] god amen for god to say go and raise
[1:05:01] that man and pray for him he's going to
[1:05:03] live again
[1:05:04] cold his eyes been dead how long oh
[1:05:07] 24-hour dead baby and god showed him
[1:05:12] resurrection amen
[1:05:14] see that's the kind of like the brother
[1:05:16] said where's the god of elijah but it
[1:05:19] ain't god who's that thought it's us
[1:05:22] we're at fault because we we we got
[1:05:24] we're holding on like he said to too
[1:05:26] many things
[1:05:28] and we just need to let it all go
[1:05:31] so that god will fulfill his purpose in
[1:05:33] us
[1:05:34] for those last days
[1:05:37] jesus once for all one time he
[1:05:39] had perfected forever those that have
[1:05:42] come into the fellowship
[1:05:44] with an everlasting blessing eternal
[1:05:46] fellowship now understand you don't
[1:05:48] you're not fully in fellowship until you
[1:05:50] get the holy ghost
[1:05:51] with the eternal presence of god with
[1:05:54] the power of the holy ghost not in
[1:05:56] symbol uh symbol out yonder or in some
[1:05:59] word or in some theology but the holy
[1:06:01] ghost in you
[1:06:03] the power of god that raised christ from
[1:06:06] the grave is made alive in you
[1:06:09] and you are now a new creature then you
[1:06:12] are a son and a daughter of god oh
[1:06:14] brother see that's it the blood of jesus
[1:06:18] christ to serve it takes the power the
[1:06:21] life that was in
[1:06:23] that blood
[1:06:24] that's what it takes
[1:06:27] like he said amen when they saw jesus go
[1:06:30] up you know those disciples was gazing
[1:06:33] in the script and the angel says why are
[1:06:34] you gazing at him he coming again in
[1:06:37] like manna
[1:06:38] and on the day of pentecost the holy
[1:06:40] spirit fell on all of them
[1:06:42] that same god that went up like elijah
[1:06:45] saw elisha saw elijah
[1:06:48] and god comes down and blesses them and
[1:06:50] fills them with the holy ghost
[1:06:53] philippians 3 13 and i'm not going to be
[1:06:55] too much longer
[1:06:57] but he says brethren
[1:06:59] i count not myself to have apprehended
[1:07:02] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[1:07:05] things which are behind and reaching
[1:07:08] forth in unto those things which are
[1:07:11] before and that's why it was it was a
[1:07:13] blessing to i won't go back i won't go
[1:07:16] back
[1:07:17] to the place or to the things that i
[1:07:19] used to be
[1:07:20] paul said i pressed toward the mark for
[1:07:23] the prize of the high calling of god in
[1:07:26] christ jesus let us therefore as many as
[1:07:29] be perfect be thus minded and if
[1:07:32] anything ye be otherwise minded god
[1:07:36] shall reveal it on on this even unto you
[1:07:39] and so you must understand as you press
[1:07:42] as you move forward
[1:07:44] you also must move forward in revelation
[1:07:47] in understanding why you move forward if
[1:07:49] you don't know where you're moving
[1:07:51] right it has to be a revelation that's
[1:07:54] that's causing you to move forward
[1:07:56] i'm the bride of jesus christ i must
[1:07:59] have virtue i must have knowledge i must
[1:08:01] have tempers i must have all of that in
[1:08:04] me
[1:08:05] and as long as i'm falling and i'm keep
[1:08:07] falling i keep falling the bible says
[1:08:09] you're lacking something
[1:08:13] it doesn't mean you don't have him but
[1:08:14] we're not maturing like we ought to and
[1:08:17] the falls and the shortcomings that we
[1:08:20] have is god says wake up you're not
[1:08:22] where you should be press forward you
[1:08:24] got to move forward
[1:08:27] you and i must move forward
[1:08:34] so what makes you long
[1:08:37] what makes you
[1:08:38] long for health
[1:08:40] what makes you long for perfection is
[1:08:42] because there see you in this life are
[1:08:45] no other negative
[1:08:46] and this earthly tabernacle dissolved we
[1:08:49] have one already waiting
[1:08:51] so it's that one that's pressing this
[1:08:54] negative groaning in the spirit to be
[1:08:57] clothed upon with the immortality that's
[1:09:00] the reason that was take place see a lot
[1:09:03] of time we think we're so backslidden
[1:09:05] you know oh god i just yeah i want to be
[1:09:07] one and don't you understand that's the
[1:09:09] working of the lord
[1:09:11] he puts us in that place to groan
[1:09:15] to desire more of him
[1:09:18] it's if gossip oops he fell again no he
[1:09:21] knows where you are but he places you
[1:09:24] there so you can look up and says god i
[1:09:26] need more of you
[1:09:29] that's what he wants
[1:09:31] that's the whole point behind it he
[1:09:34] don't want you to think oh i'm here and
[1:09:36] i'm not and you're not there
[1:09:37] we don't want to come up short
[1:09:40] so the holy spirit leads and guides us
[1:09:42] into places amen that we we don't know
[1:09:45] he sees the trip he sees the fall and
[1:09:47] like the brother said he lifts you up
[1:09:51] he's there
[1:09:53] he's not going to destroy you because
[1:09:54] you're in training
[1:09:56] you're in training you're learning how
[1:09:58] to be sons and daughters of god you're
[1:10:01] learning how to
[1:10:02] how to handle the word you're learning
[1:10:05] how to defeat the enemy you're learning
[1:10:07] his tricks and all of his wiles and all
[1:10:10] of the things that he comes at you but
[1:10:12] after a while
[1:10:14] you'll see him from a distance
[1:10:19] ooh you see there's got to be a deep
[1:10:20] calling to the deep before the there can
[1:10:22] be a deep to respond and that's what the
[1:10:25] body sets you setting yonder waiting for
[1:10:28] this to leave here to say goodbye here
[1:10:31] goodbye morning good morning there see
[1:10:34] and this old frail wrinkled up skinned
[1:10:37] scared body will drop into the dust and
[1:10:40] you'll receive a new one
[1:10:42] i don't know about you but that's
[1:10:45] that's where i'm at
[1:10:47] but i know one thing i no man can add a
[1:10:50] cupid to a statue
[1:10:52] and i know it takes god
[1:10:55] he's the only one but i believe he will
[1:10:58] and i know that this message has
[1:11:00] declared unto me that i have a theophany
[1:11:03] i've got a word body
[1:11:05] and that word body is waiting on me and
[1:11:07] you know what we'll meet one day
[1:11:10] you see but in the meanwhile i've just
[1:11:14] got to have patience
[1:11:15] and let god let go and let god
[1:11:18] in my last quote
[1:11:20] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:11:23] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:11:25] lacking nothing
[1:11:27] god will for us
[1:11:30] god's will for us is perfection
[1:11:34] and that perfection is patience
[1:11:36] waiting for god
[1:11:38] and waiting for god
[1:11:41] waiting on god i say it again and
[1:11:43] waiting for god
[1:11:45] this is the process of character
[1:11:48] development
[1:11:49] [Laughter]
[1:11:52] how mighty god has commended these
[1:11:54] saints of the dark ages patience as
[1:11:57] lambs led to the slaughter
[1:11:59] lovingly faithfully they served god
[1:12:03] that is all they wanted out of life
[1:12:06] just service to their lord
[1:12:08] how great was to be
[1:12:10] their reward
[1:12:13] and that's out of the exposition think
[1:12:15] about it
[1:12:17] how great is your reward
[1:12:19] in this most wicked age ever
[1:12:22] but yet you waited for god
[1:12:25] no turning back no turning back
[1:12:28] it's forward onward christian soldier
[1:12:31] merging as the war with the cross of
[1:12:34] jesus going on before
[1:12:36] you and i can see the world falling
[1:12:38] apart we see
[1:12:40] the the gathering together we see the
[1:12:42] unity of the churches in the system and
[1:12:45] what they're about to do we see the
[1:12:47] earth groaning quaking and shaking and
[1:12:49] earthquakes and volcanoes and tidal
[1:12:52] waves and you name it everything is
[1:12:53] happening diseases and pacifists people
[1:12:56] well uh you know what about the book of
[1:12:58] revelation you're living in it

[1:13:04] that great tribulation there'll be a
[1:13:06] catching away
[1:13:08] there'll be a bride
[1:13:09] and i'm so glad to be part of it
[1:13:11] i'm so thankful that god revealed and
[1:13:13] opened to us the dangers of being part
[1:13:16] of an organization or denomination
[1:13:18] i'm so thankful that god has given us
[1:13:20] the grace to see that all of that is
[1:13:22] going to lead up into the mark of the
[1:13:24] beast
[1:13:25] i'm so grateful
[1:13:27] that god mercy has been with us and that
[1:13:29] in itself has given me an increase of
[1:13:31] faith to know that he that begun the
[1:13:33] good work in us is faithful and listen
[1:13:35] he separated us i did not separate
[1:13:38] myself he separated us

[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:40] we're getting ready to turn to change
[1:15:42] the order of the service
[1:15:44] and as our brother continue to
[1:15:48] play myself
[1:15:52] for the communion
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:16:24] so
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:36] just why
[1:16:38] he came
[1:16:40] to love me
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:57] i shall
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:07] me
[1:17:38] oh
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:52] goodness
[1:17:54] for those who are
[1:17:58] tonight we ask that you turn with us to
[1:18:01] first corinthians
[1:18:04] we'll read the 11th chapter
[1:18:07] beginning at the 23rd verse
[1:18:12] which is our normal scripture that we
[1:18:13] read for communion
[1:18:16] and it reads for i have received of the
[1:18:18] lord that which
[1:18:20] also i delivered unto you
[1:18:23] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:18:25] which
[1:18:26] he was betrayed took bread
[1:18:29] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:18:32] and said take e this is my body
[1:18:35] which is broken for you this dude in
[1:18:37] remembrance of me
[1:18:39] after the same manner also took the cup
[1:18:42] he took the cup
[1:18:44] when he had sucked saying this cup is
[1:18:46] the new testament in my blood
[1:18:48] this to eat as often as you drink it in
[1:18:51] remembrance of me
[1:18:53] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:18:55] drink this cup ye do show
[1:18:58] the lord's death till he comes
[1:19:00] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:19:03] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:19:05] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:19:07] and blood of the lord
[1:19:11] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:19:13] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:19:16] cup
[1:19:17] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy
[1:19:19] eat it and drink it a damnation to
[1:19:21] himself
[1:19:22] not discerning the lord's body
[1:19:25] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:19:27] among you and many sleep
[1:19:30] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:19:32] should not be judged
[1:19:35] but when we are judged we are chasten of
[1:19:37] the lord that we should not be condemned
[1:19:39] with the world
[1:19:41] wherefore my brethren
[1:19:43] when you come together to eat
[1:19:46] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:19:48] hunger let him eat at home
[1:19:51] that you come not together unto
[1:19:53] condemnation
[1:19:55] and the rest i will set in order
[1:19:57] when i come
