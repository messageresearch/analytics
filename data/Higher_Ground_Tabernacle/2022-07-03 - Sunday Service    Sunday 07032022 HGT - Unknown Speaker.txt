precious name of jesus oh we have the victory [Music] is see daddy foreign foreign foreign five christ for it is man amen amen so as we were saying the billboard god's billboard so as i was meditating on what i had to preach we have to look um search where the spirit has to take us based on what has already been preached so we just pray that god gives us a message that can impact people's lives we don't just preach to preach but we pray so that we be taken in the spirit of god the little topic that we're going to talk about this morning it concerns all of us it doesn't concern just one person one brother or a sister it concerns every one of us and the good attitude that we're supposed to have to see if your life gets up to the word of god the word of god is not preached and when the word of god is preached you don't when someone when the word of god is preached you don't look at somebody else when the word of god preached you're saying you're always saying uh you're always looking at somebody else but when the word of god is preached it's always new you don't get used to the word of god that's why i want every one of us this morning to be careful it's a little sermon that's not going to take long if the lord helps us help us we can finish in 45 minutes its taste from where shall it be salted [Music] it's good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trolled trodden under food of man because imagine you have salt on your hands but you try to taste salt it doesn't have its savory what can you do with that salt to make it to to give back its savior it's no good for no for not for nothing just to be cast out no more that's why [Music] to be salted and that's why the lord says you are the salt of the earth [Music] you don't put the lights onto your back but you put it on the table you put it on the place where it can light up everybody we learned that jesus christ himself said he's the light of the world but jesus is not the only one that's the light of the world he says that we are also the lights of the world and when [Music] he has to light up those who are in darkness as he there are all kinds of things on the billboard women and all kinds of things that sometimes [Music] and it was well organized it had a good appearance on the billboard but when you actually get to the place that the billboard said that place existed they're gonna tell you know that's all you that's all you can see here but the advertisement remains does not exist no more just imagine you saw a good hamburger and that you're hungry you're you're craving for an amberger now looking at the the advertisement for that amber hamburger and now you're hungry to eat that embryo now you go to mcdonald's they tell you that there is no that hamburger will no we no longer have that hamburger here i think you're gonna tell them you're gonna ask them why did you leave that billboard there with that image you should have removed that image on the billboard [Music] now when the world will come to us [Music] when pagans will come to us when they will come to but the problem is that today when those the one who doesn't pray come to the believer where he was supposed to find peace where he was supposed to find the pizza joy of the heart where he was supposed to find all the virtues of god knowledge and patience but when he this thing was for peter and paul but we're supposed to be billboards of god all the virtues of god have to be found at us but i came to build individuals so that when pagans will come to them they will find all the virtues of god brother brother says here what i just told you it is christ of jesus christ [Music] that's why [Music] so that we become distributors of the word of god by his power that's the purpose of the the message the purpose why the message came that's why brother brethren says so that you understand that you are also messengers the messengers of this message that's what brother branham says there was one day [Music] and his boss organized a party like that because he had a lot of benefits in his business and as they gathered that morning that night and that they were playing or after making the lolo now brother says we had a little dinner they had a little dinner it's in the sermon thirst for life preached in 1960 [Music] now he says they gave a little topic and then we had they had this little thing and everything and after everything was done the people um back backed up back down and his boss told him you can help back up because we're gonna have some um we're gonna have fun here and brother brown says what kind of uh fun are you going to have his boss told him is it going to bother you if you can go just stand at the door says he says this little the the the person told him brother brahman i believe you don't believe in dancing but those people here will dance [Music] and she ran in in the a comfort for for a person working at night and then she could play with her little children and then have a good life a good free life astonished to see the way this little girl was acting and she this little girl was running touching every man and she got back to me and said my voice you can hear me without the mic maybe all the every man there now she got back to brother and she told birth brother if you don't say can you dance with me brother brown says i said we might damage you yes yes madam i want to dance and she said well come dance with me and brother brown says i got to the the dancing floor and i said i i held her hand there is one thing that i used to that i always do before anything and we're going to do that but there is one thing that i always do before anything else shut up what is i then i told her about uh get on your knees and then i held her here and she couldn't do anything now we stopped that thing in just a couple minutes certainly brother branham and they took all their instruments their brother brown says i said you can fire me if you want to you can fire me if you want to take a second with whatever i just did i disturbed all your progress program here but his one [Music] i always pray before doing anything that's the question that i'm going to ask everyone before doing one thing do you always pray it's very easy to see a brother in the restaurant ordering food and then it starts eating brother brothers tries to eat when the pork tries to eat he's only going to eat it he never looks up where the apples come from [Music] they don't pray no more we're ashamed of the masses we're ashamed to pray to identify ourselves as christians because we are we have we are ashamed our boss we don't want our boss to know that we're christians we don't want our friends to know that we're christians because those who represented christianity but when christianity was christianity caring the name of the christians was a great responsibility and it was joy the christians samson was raised [Music] to destroy the nation of the first time but because he forgot who he was that nation destroyed himself the thing that god raised us foreign [Music] and you're gonna see the caller uh how he gets mad [Music] he should be the one that's the nicest person on earth it's a sweetest person on it because he represents christ christ was a gentleman a judge a man of 33 years old they they they and as christ was screaming as he was crying the angels told him but master the marston just do a sign just do it just point something and we're gonna destroy the earth because you cannot suffer like that jesus told them you don't know what the son of man came to do the son of man did not come here to lose but he came it was just raise your hand like that the son of a man did not come to loose christianity that they recognize that they were disciples of christ but today the love that we face it's just a a simulated love christian is on everything they're criticizing gossip they're christian was supposed to be the most respected person in the society the christian would should identify himself with a good education because outside of the school that he had find problems with you without even going to the word there are some pagans unbelievers that when their brother is angry they know that they have to refrain themselves their drug problem so they resolve big issues without even going to the word but what about us no problem how much how much issues can we resolve with all humility with all peace i am ashamed she's falling and we're just looking at it when you try to when you try to show something to your brother or your sister they will always give you reasons christianity of today have produced a lot of intellectuals more than christians real christians and there is intellectual christianity we're talking about the face of the heart who can live like that again [Music] who can accept that somebody takes his beer like jesus christ accepted it that they spit on you who can accept that today in the good way what did you say paul was saying in hebrew chapter 12 he said no he said we also know and sin that's that beset there's always someone that's trying to get an influence from me that's what paul was saying because we're so compassed with the clouds of witnesses let us lay aside every way [Music] it's not the word of god anymore it's not the sermons anymore it's not the sermons but if we act just like the world that's why the church is without power that's why the church is now full of intellectuals more than christians the world is tired they're tired don't let anything uh dirty come in my little children pleading [Music] don't let anything defiled come to during the dark ages [Music] because of god yeah you know the story was was uh running they were taking pregnant women they will split their stuff their stomach and take their child just because of the word because they were defending the values of christians the only thing they did wrong was to believe in jesus christ that's why they killed him but today of us today so that you don't represent the word in the good way that contains the blood of your sisters and brothers so that we betray the world what testimony are you going to have what are you going to tell when you stand in front of those people that lost their lives because of the word my brothers and sisters and when blood will dry out on your veins [Music] what testimony is going to come behind you what works are you going to leave in your life are you going to leave on this earth i would have left that for my children maybe if i had a bear i would have left it for my children maybe if i had a wrenches i would have left that for myself but i don't possess all the goods of this world the only thing i can leave for my children of one thing i'm certain enough is the word of god because it's eternal bankrupt all those things this wrench can burn but the thing the only thing that's going to stay eternally is the word of god that's why us as parents we have to be responsible for every act we make because we have children behind us who are looking at us the parents will carry the burden of every action they did on earth [Music] he would always [Music] and as he was doing that his boy his little boy also tried to imitate him he also tried to walk just like him no the dead the father stopped and he said he said oh son why are you doing this the son told him [Music] the responsibility that we have as a true love they need to find that love without hypocrisy a we may stand you can give a song i might sing the song lord i want to be a christian in my life amen lord i want to be a christian in my heart in my heart lord i want to be a christian in my heart oh in my heart in my heart lord i want to be a christian in my heart oh lord i

lord forgive me lord for everything i've done that did not represent you in the good way i was supposed to be a billboards for you i was supposed to represent you in the good way because those who don't it's in that moment they'll be thirsty of you let's just pray for a little moment yes foreign for coming to to your your throne of grace to ask for your grace because we have realized we have to

forgive ourselves we ask your lord we give all our transgressions we find ourselves once more alert we forgive us more sincerely [Music] to have the name of christians we're ashamed of it we're
