[46:02] [Music]
[46:09] now that felt good
[46:12] hallelujah you know the master of the
[46:14] wind
[46:15] thank you brother and we're gonna go
[46:17] right into the scripture
[46:19] we appreciate all that you do
[46:23] all that everybody does around here it's
[46:26] wonderful
[46:29] i was thinking
[46:33] such an inspiration struck me this
[46:35] morning when i was ministering and
[46:39] where two or three are gathered in my
[46:41] name
[46:43] oftentimes we think two or three is
[46:46] working with just
[46:48] numbers but it's more to it than that
[46:52] because those two or three has to be on
[46:56] one accord
[46:58] must have the same mind and the same
[47:01] determination
[47:03] in order for god to move you you can
[47:05] have two or three but if you got one in
[47:07] there that's doubting
[47:08] or two that's doubting it's not the same
[47:10] effect the bible says a two-quarter
[47:12] strong but a three chord
[47:14] is hard to break and i was just thinking
[47:17] about how that if we could get the
[47:19] people of god just two or three
[47:22] on one accord we can really see god do
[47:26] something in this place
[47:28] set our mind on a revival
[47:32] and when i mean revival i don't mean
[47:35] jumping and shouting
[47:36] i mean a cleaning house and getting our
[47:39] minds and hearts set on the coming of
[47:41] the lord
[47:43] we can really see something take place
[47:46] by the grace of god
[47:48] as we stand let us turn to second
[47:50] corinthians
[47:51] we're gonna go there the third chapter
[47:54] and then from second corinthians we ask
[47:56] that you turn with us
[47:57] by the grace of god to romans
[48:01] the eighth chapter i'm very excited it
[48:05] may not look like i
[48:06] am but i am i feel right now as light as
[48:10] a feather
[48:10] and i know that's god
[48:14] if i got on a natural man scale it
[48:16] wouldn't be be that but
[48:18] i really feel good in my soul and uh
[48:22] as a as of as of what i know now there
[48:24] is
[48:25] nothing hindering my soul and i surely
[48:28] thank god for that
[48:30] second corinthians the third chapter we
[48:32] got we're going to read there at the
[48:33] 17th
[48:34] verse we appreciate the word of god
[48:37] i am looking with expectation
[48:40] for the translation and i don't want
[48:44] nobody to interrupt me
[48:48] i got my mind made up
[48:52] and i won't turn back hallelujah ii
[48:55] corinthians the third chapter
[48:58] and um
[49:01] the 17th verse i i i'm i'm seeing grace
[49:04] in such a way that i've never seen it
[49:06] before
[49:08] uh it's always been there
[49:14] but grace when once revealed
[49:19] causes you to love god
[49:23] it's no longer law it causes you to love
[49:27] god
[49:28] when you see the amount of grace that
[49:31] he's bestowed upon us
[49:35] second corinthians 3 17.
[49:42] let's go to the 16th verse that's that's
[49:44] more appropriate
[49:46] nevertheless when he shelter and to the
[49:48] lord
[49:49] the veil shall be taken away
[49:52] now the lord is that spirit
[49:56] and where the spirit of the lord is
[49:58] there is liberty
[50:00] but we all with open face beholding
[50:04] as in a glass the glory of the lord
[50:08] are charged or excuse me are changed
[50:11] in the same image from glory to glory
[50:15] even as by the spirit of the lord
[50:19] and if you remember in my early
[50:20] messengers message is i showed the
[50:22] difference between being formed in his
[50:25] image
[50:26] and being formed in his likeness the
[50:29] difference between the two
[50:31] in his image we're working with the
[50:33] theophany we're working with the very
[50:35] character and nature of god
[50:37] adam was first created in the image he
[50:40] was first a spiritual man
[50:42] then he was created a natural man which
[50:45] was his likeness
[50:46] that's why the bible says image and
[50:48] lightness
[50:49] but here the scripture is telling us
[50:51] that in this day
[50:52] we're being created into his image he's
[50:55] not even working with the natural man
[50:58] he's working with the image of the inner
[51:00] man
[51:02] let us turn now by god's grace
[51:05] to romans the eighth chapter
[51:10] don't you just love a god like that
[51:13] a god who creates hallelujah he doesn't
[51:17] leave his creation up to us
[51:19] right hallelujah he creates
[51:23] he's the master builder amen so
[51:26] romans 8 26
[51:31] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[51:35] infirmities
[51:36] for we know not what we should pray for
[51:39] as we ought
[51:40] but the spirit itself make an
[51:42] intercession for us
[51:44] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[51:47] and he that searches the heart knoweth
[51:49] what is the mind of the spirit
[51:52] because he maketh intercessions for the
[51:55] saints according to the will
[51:57] of god and we know
[52:00] that all things work together for good
[52:03] to them that love god to them
[52:06] who are called are the called
[52:09] according to his purpose
[52:13] for whom he did for no he also
[52:17] predestinated to be conformed to the
[52:20] image of his son
[52:22] that he might be the firstborn among
[52:24] many brethren
[52:26] moreover whom he did predestinate
[52:30] them he also called for whom he called
[52:33] them he also justified and whom he
[52:35] justified
[52:36] them he also glorified
[52:40] what shall we say to all these things
[52:44] if god be for us
[52:47] who can be against us
[52:50] let us pray father god we come before
[52:53] you lord and we thank you for your
[52:54] amazing grace
[52:56] we thank you for being so good to us
[52:58] lord you have
[53:00] been a million times better to ourselves
[53:04] to us than we've been to ourselves lord
[53:07] the number
[53:09] cannot even be counted i can walk
[53:12] through my daily life
[53:14] and see where grace has met me grace has
[53:16] met me grace has met me grace has met me
[53:19] hallelujah and i am so grateful for your
[53:22] amazing grace
[53:24] forgive us for anything we may have said
[53:26] or done that has not been
[53:28] pleasing in our sight and i pray pray
[53:30] tonight oh god that you would just help
[53:32] us
[53:33] and show us lord teach us and guide us
[53:36] most of all cause us to love you
[53:40] as you love us we want to be that union
[53:44] of of saint john 17 where you say i am
[53:47] in the father the father's in me and i
[53:49] am in you
[53:50] that's what we want that's what we
[53:52] thirst for
[53:53] so let it be according to your will in
[53:56] jesus christ's name we pray
[53:58] amen you may be seated
[54:02] hallelujah
[54:05] god is so good to us i say that all the
[54:08] time and
[54:10] i honestly don't get tired of saying it
[54:14] because it's so true it's so true it's
[54:16] so true
[54:17] and sometimes when i think about his
[54:19] goodness i almost lose my mind i feel
[54:21] like if i just let go
[54:23] i might not come back
[54:27] because i can see it it's so crystal
[54:29] clear to me
[54:31] knowing where i came from and know where
[54:33] i am now and where i'm going
[54:35] and i know that everything has been
[54:37] ordered by the lord
[54:39] and when we come to this day i was
[54:41] thinking about this new year and now
[54:44] uh first sunday of the new year
[54:47] and and and how god has really blessed
[54:49] us amen how he brought us through
[54:51] 2020 and of course 2020 represented
[54:54] perfect vision
[54:56] and as i said last night or this morning
[54:58] if you
[54:59] in 2020 if you didn't see your position
[55:02] and where you stood in god because god
[55:04] was showing all of us
[55:06] where we were spiritually up the scale
[55:10] whether we were in the valley on the
[55:12] plains or a mountaintop
[55:14] god showed us we must be honest let's
[55:17] face the facts
[55:19] but they're there he just didn't leave
[55:21] us there
[55:22] right he's he's telling us amen that
[55:25] there's room for
[55:26] improvement and understand no man can
[55:29] add a cubit to his statue
[55:32] but i i thought to myself because i was
[55:35] listening to the message living he loved
[55:37] me
[55:37] you know living loving you know you know
[55:40] that that
[55:41] and i saw the adept of the resurrection
[55:44] or the death of his death
[55:46] in a way i had never seen before and you
[55:49] know the prophet god says that
[55:50] no man could have died that death no one
[55:54] could have done that
[55:55] jesus christ was the only man designed
[55:58] to do it and i often
[56:02] think how many times
[56:05] the enemy perhaps tried to make him quit
[56:09] or stop in the process but the bible
[56:12] said he set himself his face like a
[56:14] flint
[56:15] he was determined you see he wasn't
[56:18] about saving himself like that
[56:19] like they screamed out you know you save
[56:22] others but you can't save yourself
[56:24] and how true that was it's not that he
[56:26] couldn't save himself he didn't want to
[56:28] save himself
[56:30] because there were others he wanted to
[56:32] save
[56:33] and oftentimes you know you know i heard
[56:36] somebody
[56:37] on on the youtube he was talking about
[56:39] oh early christians how
[56:40] early christians were ashamed of how
[56:43] they worship and i thought oh
[56:45] you missed it early christians
[56:48] never was ashamed of how they worship
[56:53] it was the counterfeits
[56:56] that came along afterwards who became
[56:59] ashamed of the way the spirit of god
[57:02] would move them
[57:04] it's always been that way but when i
[57:08] look
[57:08] at this message and that's why i keep
[57:11] bringing something
[57:12] to god keep bringing something opening
[57:15] more and more and more to me because
[57:17] as we said that here in the church ages
[57:20] were rules and regulations
[57:22] you know justification and you know how
[57:25] that was and then
[57:26] sanctification when wesley came it was
[57:29] the method is you had to do it this way
[57:30] and that way and you couldn't do this it
[57:32] was
[57:32] touch not taste not hand or not it was
[57:35] and that kind of a trend
[57:37] went all the way throughout even up to
[57:40] pentecost or
[57:41] and then you know brother branham
[57:42] brought it to our attention it wouldn't
[57:44] last it didn't last he said
[57:45] if the methodist could really see
[57:49] what the the methodist of that day was
[57:51] doing
[57:52] he said they would turn over in their
[57:54] graves why because the
[57:56] natural the standard of sanctification
[57:58] in which they laid out was now
[58:01] gone i mean even when it comes to
[58:03] holiness and pentecostalism
[58:05] you you look at the standard and you
[58:07] find out that what the problem was it
[58:09] was always law
[58:11] and never grace you see and only grace
[58:14] can come when you actually see grace you
[58:16] can receive grace
[58:18] grace in itself is a revelation that
[58:20] produces
[58:21] love you understand me because it's one
[58:25] way of loving god you can be made to do
[58:28] something but
[58:28] the bible said the goodness of the lord
[58:31] ought to lead the man into repentance
[58:34] right so there's a different level
[58:37] there's a different
[58:37] element there's a different level of
[58:39] grace that god tries to bring us
[58:41] into and and and here we understand it
[58:44] finally we we get it because the bible
[58:48] tells us that the capstone
[58:50] the headstone comes down with
[58:54] grace grace he started the church with
[58:58] grace
[58:59] and he ends the church with grace right
[59:03] and you must understand that the grace
[59:05] of god is the unmerited love
[59:08] and favor that god has or have toward us
[59:12] right it has nothing to do with
[59:16] you it's all about god
[59:20] god chose you god chose me i am so glad
[59:23] about it
[59:24] and think about it one in a million
[59:28] in this age god chooses us
[59:32] and think about it that even in this age
[59:36] among ourselves how god
[59:39] is dealing with you as an individual
[59:43] and the man or the woman who sits next
[59:45] to you he may not they may not even hear
[59:47] or even understand
[59:49] what's going on one thing i know about
[59:52] life
[59:54] is there's nothing that can control life
[59:57] hello because god is life
[1:00:01] i remember the time i preached a message
[1:00:04] years and years ago
[1:00:05] penetration and i literally got that
[1:00:08] story of that
[1:00:09] that inspiration because i was walking
[1:00:11] along and i was watching the pavement
[1:00:14] and i saw a little piece of grass
[1:00:16] coming up through the pavement it didn't
[1:00:18] go around it
[1:00:19] it was coming up through that pavement
[1:00:21] and i was amazed and i thought well how
[1:00:24] on earth
[1:00:25] did that happen how was how is that
[1:00:27] possible
[1:00:28] see because nothing can hinder life the
[1:00:31] grave couldn't hallelujah
[1:00:33] the grave couldn't hold him you
[1:00:36] understand me
[1:00:38] stone they rolled a stone amen over the
[1:00:41] grave and they thought they could hold
[1:00:42] life
[1:00:43] you can't capture life life is god
[1:00:47] and i saw that little piece of gray
[1:00:49] grass come up through that blade that
[1:00:51] that
[1:00:51] pavement and i thought oh how heavy that
[1:00:54] and concentrated that that that that
[1:00:56] that pavement was that that brick that
[1:00:59] man-made brick like you know what i'm
[1:01:01] saying
[1:01:01] that man-made brick those cages those
[1:01:04] things that the
[1:01:05] the the dominations put us in and try to
[1:01:07] cage us in but you can't cages you can't
[1:01:10] cages and then
[1:01:11] because why that seed hear the voice of
[1:01:14] god
[1:01:14] come out of her my people and no matter
[1:01:17] how thick the walls are
[1:01:19] it they may even seem uh in
[1:01:24] when you can't penetrate it
[1:01:27] but god's word penetrates
[1:01:31] all darkness and that light strikes that
[1:01:35] seed
[1:01:36] you can be a catholic you could be a
[1:01:38] buddha
[1:01:40] a allah a muslim hinduism
[1:01:44] it doesn't matter how thick the walls
[1:01:47] are
[1:01:48] how heavy it is
[1:01:51] if the seed of god is in you
[1:01:56] when the light strikes it penetrates
[1:01:59] all man-made traditions you understand
[1:02:02] me
[1:02:03] it cannot be conquered no
[1:02:06] element no time no space
[1:02:10] can ever conquer life amen
[1:02:14] because life is god and think about it
[1:02:20] how invincible you are
[1:02:23] i'm not talking about your flesh but i'm
[1:02:26] talking about
[1:02:28] the life that's in you through christ
[1:02:31] we don't worry about death death doesn't
[1:02:34] scare us
[1:02:36] because we understand we've already
[1:02:38] passed from
[1:02:39] death unto life
[1:02:43] we are invincible and the devil knows it
[1:02:46] and all the devil can do or all the
[1:02:49] devil can
[1:02:50] try to do is make your life miserable
[1:02:52] here
[1:02:54] but he cannot stop your resurrection
[1:02:59] no wonder in the preview of the church
[1:03:02] brother branham saw the
[1:03:04] christian church marching
[1:03:07] so i want you to understand
[1:03:10] that even when we came through the
[1:03:12] church ages
[1:03:14] that was really a platform
[1:03:17] that was what what brother balum called
[1:03:19] it a bogus
[1:03:21] now understand there was life in there
[1:03:24] but it wasn't the original life
[1:03:27] being seen original life went down in
[1:03:31] the day of pentecost
[1:03:33] in the early church in the ephesus age
[1:03:36] and it went down there and
[1:03:37] it died and it came up like a stalk
[1:03:40] but we could never see the original
[1:03:44] right what they did on the day of
[1:03:46] pentecost and prior to that
[1:03:47] we could not see that we saw little bits
[1:03:51] and pieces of this
[1:03:52] that and the other now watch this
[1:03:54] because even in
[1:03:55] azusa street 1906
[1:03:59] they thought that was the life the the
[1:04:02] thing that would bring
[1:04:04] the resurrection but that was just the
[1:04:07] restoration of the gifts
[1:04:09] and i'm preaching tonight because i've
[1:04:11] got some quotes but nevertheless the
[1:04:12] prophet god said
[1:04:14] they thought that was going to produce
[1:04:17] the rapture and it did not
[1:04:20] why because it was just the restoration
[1:04:24] of the gifts it was just the
[1:04:27] shock the thing that looked like the
[1:04:31] original life
[1:04:33] but that wasn't it so that's why he
[1:04:36] basically said
[1:04:37] when it comes to speaking in tongues
[1:04:39] shouting dancing
[1:04:41] healing raising the dead we've seen all
[1:04:43] of that
[1:04:44] but that's not it amen
[1:04:48] why because even in that age
[1:04:52] you had impersonators you had demonic
[1:04:56] power
[1:04:56] working within the framework of the
[1:04:58] pentecostal realm
[1:05:00] and the people did not even know the
[1:05:03] difference
[1:05:06] hallelujah but then god sent
[1:05:09] a prophet a seer
[1:05:14] that was greater than their mediums you
[1:05:16] know because a lot of christians still
[1:05:18] go to mediums
[1:05:20] right but a true prophet of god
[1:05:25] no matter how small the gift or how
[1:05:29] great the gift is
[1:05:30] he always magnify the lord
[1:05:34] jesus christ
[1:05:37] nothing can conquer the word y'all know
[1:05:40] that
[1:05:42] we don't even know when god said let
[1:05:44] there be light
[1:05:45] how long ago that's been
[1:05:50] hallelujah is that right you know we get
[1:05:53] so tied up with traditions
[1:05:55] and and things of men you know you know
[1:05:57] i
[1:05:59] yeah i just recently learned that you
[1:06:00] know celebrating birthdays
[1:06:02] you know as hedonistic
[1:06:05] just like celebrating chris christmas
[1:06:09] but you know i ain't going there but my
[1:06:11] point
[1:06:12] is you know i i i'm not criticizing
[1:06:15] nobody if that's what they want to do
[1:06:17] my point is that don't save you neither
[1:06:19] does it make you lost
[1:06:22] see you're saved by the grace of god
[1:06:25] you know that's why brother branham
[1:06:26] handles what he said well
[1:06:28] yeah even easter be careful because even
[1:06:31] easter
[1:06:32] amen is it's it comes from wrong
[1:06:37] now y'all come on now the truth of the
[1:06:39] matter is you're going to meet some
[1:06:40] jehovah witness and they're going to ask
[1:06:42] you
[1:06:42] you know they're going to tell you or a
[1:06:44] seven day event is it's gonna say well
[1:06:45] you know
[1:06:46] we need we must uh you know worship on
[1:06:48] on the seventh day
[1:06:49] and so you ask him then when is the
[1:06:51] seventh day
[1:06:54] because we can only go back when men
[1:06:55] start making calendars
[1:06:57] and who's to say his calendar is right
[1:07:02] but then we're supposed to worship on
[1:07:03] sunday when then how do you know when
[1:07:05] when the day of sunderland
[1:07:07] a crooked true christian worships every
[1:07:10] day we've set aside
[1:07:13] sunday but we don't know whether the
[1:07:15] sunday that we celebrate
[1:07:16] is a sunday that could be a monday
[1:07:18] tuesday or wednesday
[1:07:20] all we know is that he was resurrected
[1:07:22] on that day now when you get technical
[1:07:25] nobody knows because everybody had
[1:07:27] calendars
[1:07:30] if you don't want to you say well i
[1:07:31] you're following wrong well then what
[1:07:33] calendar you think you're
[1:07:35] following right so we can technical
[1:07:38] things we can look at these things and
[1:07:40] say
[1:07:40] but my point is does it matter
[1:07:44] at the end of the day we've come to do
[1:07:47] what
[1:07:47] worship god in spirit and in truth
[1:07:51] right we're not here to to bring a
[1:07:54] judgment on nobody we're here
[1:07:56] as individuals to make this revelation
[1:08:00] that has been preached to us in this end
[1:08:02] time
[1:08:08] really
[1:08:12] i believe it was november 17th brother
[1:08:14] branham said that noah went into the ark
[1:08:18] and nobody knows when november 17 was
[1:08:23] i know november 17 might be somebody
[1:08:25] else's november but you god don't pay no
[1:08:27] attention to that
[1:08:28] god looks at your heart and your effort
[1:08:30] in what you're trying to do
[1:08:33] we get hung up on dates and times and
[1:08:35] paul said don't do that
[1:08:36] that's beggarly that means nothing
[1:08:40] right don't lower yourself like that god
[1:08:42] has brought you a spirit
[1:08:44] and they that worship him must worship
[1:08:45] him in spirit and truth
[1:08:47] and and and and where the spirit of the
[1:08:49] lord is there is liberty
[1:08:51] is that right that's why
[1:08:54] david said no i'm hungry and i'm going
[1:08:56] to eat this
[1:08:59] all right jesus went into somebody's
[1:09:01] field and said oh okay there's corn
[1:09:03] we're going to eat this
[1:09:05] right and when you say well see but
[1:09:07] people can get all strung up on times
[1:09:10] and laws and rules and
[1:09:12] and i'm not throwing up but i want you
[1:09:13] to understand that we are being made
[1:09:15] free
[1:09:18] and we must understand what this message
[1:09:20] come to bring us we
[1:09:21] we can't have nothing tying us down
[1:09:25] absolutely nothing and he whom the son
[1:09:28] is made free
[1:09:29] is free indeed and where the spirit of
[1:09:31] the lord is
[1:09:32] there is liberty you understand me
[1:09:35] the only way a man can ever grow in
[1:09:37] christ is that christ
[1:09:39] bring the growth
[1:09:43] right take the life out of anything and
[1:09:46] it's dead
[1:09:48] right the only thing that brings you
[1:09:50] into a perfection
[1:09:51] is the life in you growing
[1:09:54] up into christ hallelujah
[1:09:57] it is it don't get me wrong if you know
[1:10:00] order to do good and doeth not your sin
[1:10:03] but understand the working of life
[1:10:07] how many of you all have seen yourself
[1:10:10] grow naturally
[1:10:15] the only thing we know is sometimes we
[1:10:17] need a haircut
[1:10:18] but none of us seen the strands of our
[1:10:20] hair or grow
[1:10:24] huh come on you understand what i'm
[1:10:26] trying to get you to somewhere
[1:10:28] because i want you to understand amen
[1:10:30] that we're not in a system
[1:10:32] we have been made free and the point is
[1:10:35] if you know it to do good and do it to
[1:10:37] not it is sin
[1:10:39] it doesn't our freedom doesn't give us
[1:10:42] liberty to sin
[1:10:44] because when god when jesus christ was
[1:10:46] raised from the dead
[1:10:47] guess what sin died
[1:10:52] now i want you to understand what i'm
[1:10:53] saying to the believer
[1:10:55] sin is dead in other words to the
[1:10:58] believer
[1:10:59] there is no unbelief
[1:11:03] oh come on somebody that's what sin is
[1:11:06] it's unbelief
[1:11:07] and when the word comes we don't have to
[1:11:09] understand it
[1:11:10] we don't have to explain it we say like
[1:11:13] mary
[1:11:14] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:11:17] this is what god brings to us
[1:11:20] coming from the quote amen if this is
[1:11:23] okay with you i'm gonna read this
[1:11:24] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:11:27] because i look at these things and i'm
[1:11:29] so glad for
[1:11:30] genesis 1 11 where it says
[1:11:33] every seed shall break forth of its kind
[1:11:36] i'm happy about that
[1:11:37] because i realize that i'm not doing the
[1:11:39] same
[1:11:41] it's not him that willeth nor he that
[1:11:43] runeth but god that
[1:11:44] who showeth mercy right it's god who's
[1:11:47] doing this thing in us
[1:11:49] nobody will be able to boast a brag and
[1:11:51] i'm not getting that from any of you
[1:11:53] but i'm bringing this to you so you can
[1:11:55] understand we have no room for pride and
[1:11:58] arrogance
[1:12:00] there is no room the bible tells us that
[1:12:03] humility bring god's on the scene
[1:12:06] and all of your growth will determine on
[1:12:09] how
[1:12:09] humble you can be you know did you know
[1:12:12] that
[1:12:13] dying and rotting means to yield to
[1:12:15] god's will
[1:12:17] set yours aside and yield to god's will
[1:12:24] hallelujah nothing can conquer the word
[1:12:27] so let me ask you a question then if
[1:12:29] that be true then who are you
[1:12:32] what portion do you fit feel in this
[1:12:34] scripture
[1:12:36] jesus christ had to come in here in the
[1:12:38] bible and find his position
[1:12:40] right remember amen when he opened up
[1:12:43] the scripture
[1:12:45] he went to isaiah right and talked about
[1:12:48] how
[1:12:49] amen the captain would be set free and
[1:12:51] all of these things
[1:12:52] and then he goes on to say and this day
[1:12:54] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:12:56] in your ears he understood where he was
[1:12:59] in the word
[1:13:00] nothing could take him away from that
[1:13:03] nothing could deter
[1:13:05] him from being that he was that
[1:13:08] and he proved it by character
[1:13:11] and by the life he lived you see what
[1:13:14] i'm saying
[1:13:15] now he says now here's what i'm trying
[1:13:18] to say to you
[1:13:20] the law of reproduction bring
[1:13:23] forth of its kind hallelujah
[1:13:27] so you're saying what if the seed of god
[1:13:30] is in you
[1:13:31] if the life is in you it brings forth of
[1:13:35] is kind i'm gonna say it again
[1:13:39] see because you know why we have been so
[1:13:42] used
[1:13:45] to the teachings of the organizations
[1:13:50] to we always want to put our hands to it
[1:13:53] now it it almost seems uh uh
[1:13:57] like you know i'm trying to preach
[1:13:59] something hypocritical
[1:14:01] but i'm trying to say this when a man
[1:14:05] pray is when he connects with god
[1:14:10] he gets into the shekinah glory he's
[1:14:14] just laying there praying
[1:14:16] it is the shekinah it is the life of god
[1:14:19] that then takes over and produces the
[1:14:22] character
[1:14:24] take all of the greenness out take all
[1:14:26] of the deadness out
[1:14:27] and produces what life would bring in
[1:14:30] you
[1:14:32] right you're not in there flexing your
[1:14:34] muscles
[1:14:35] you're not in there trying to prove to
[1:14:37] god what you can do
[1:14:39] you're laying as a dead man so that god
[1:14:43] can work
[1:14:44] in you and through you that's why so
[1:14:47] many people christians get frustrated
[1:14:49] i've been there lord i ain't gonna do
[1:14:51] that ever again
[1:14:53] boom whenever you say something like
[1:14:56] that god says okay
[1:14:57] talk talk to him devil god will let the
[1:15:01] devil trip you
[1:15:03] hallelujah if you said lord's willing
[1:15:08] that makes a difference then you put put
[1:15:11] your desire into the will of the lord
[1:15:14] right and the will of the lord is that
[1:15:17] you what
[1:15:17] prosper even as your soul prosper he
[1:15:20] wants you to prosper
[1:15:21] so when you set your will into the will
[1:15:24] of god
[1:15:25] then you put your problems into god's
[1:15:28] hand
[1:15:29] and now it's god's business to make the
[1:15:31] change
[1:15:33] hallelujah see the law of reproduction
[1:15:38] yeah it is you know i sometimes this
[1:15:41] this thing that bothers me sometimes but
[1:15:43] that's the way a tree is made
[1:15:46] you know a tree you know don't hop up
[1:15:47] and walk and go where it wants to go and
[1:15:49] it can't say well you know
[1:15:50] that water on the other side of the
[1:15:52] river looks fresher to me and i think
[1:15:54] i'm going to uproot myself and go over
[1:15:55] there
[1:15:56] that tree is steadfast your trees
[1:16:02] anchored in the word as long as you
[1:16:05] anchor yourself in the word
[1:16:07] don't move because god is going to bring
[1:16:11] the sunshine
[1:16:12] the rain the storms he's going to prune
[1:16:17] your limbs anything that's not doing
[1:16:20] right he's going to cut it off
[1:16:22] you might have a little few lightning
[1:16:24] flashes in your life
[1:16:26] but my point is you ain't cut
[1:16:30] and as the storm rock you and real
[1:16:34] a little bit what the brother said about
[1:16:36] that your
[1:16:37] roots are getting deeper the storms are
[1:16:39] good for you
[1:16:42] right so this is the way nature works
[1:16:46] nature works and so i say all of this to
[1:16:49] say
[1:16:49] don't think that you and i gonna get out
[1:16:52] of this
[1:16:53] dimension on a bed of ease
[1:16:57] the storm is coming
[1:17:02] but it's there he said listen genesis 1
[1:17:05] 11
[1:17:06] and he goes on to say these last days
[1:17:09] the true
[1:17:10] church bride comes to the headstone will
[1:17:13] be
[1:17:13] the super church a super race
[1:17:17] nearing the great headstone
[1:17:21] this is what i'm saying we can't just
[1:17:23] leave
[1:17:24] amen the headstone separate
[1:17:27] the holy ghost unites us
[1:17:30] is a invisible union
[1:17:34] and i think that's what people it looked
[1:17:36] like it's a space in there but no no
[1:17:38] that is a union
[1:17:40] there's a union there and what people
[1:17:43] don't see
[1:17:44] is because it's invisible we don't have
[1:17:46] lines
[1:17:47] why because that union is eternal
[1:17:52] there's no lines with us how eternal can
[1:17:55] you be
[1:17:58] box can hold you what line can hold you
[1:18:02] there's nothing that can hold you not
[1:18:04] even this body
[1:18:05] because when you die this soul
[1:18:09] and the spirit leaves this body and
[1:18:12] connects with another
[1:18:16] you understand what
[1:18:19] the essence of a true believer is god
[1:18:23] all that god is you are now there is no
[1:18:27] way to explain it
[1:18:29] you got to believe it mary said
[1:18:32] to the angel lord how can this thing be
[1:18:35] how can i bring forth a child and i
[1:18:38] don't know a man
[1:18:40] right and that's what a lot of people
[1:18:42] think well let me ask you a question
[1:18:44] what happened to the eunuch that philip
[1:18:48] witnessed to
[1:18:49] was caught up what happened to him
[1:18:53] you know what he'll be there
[1:18:58] what organization or denomination
[1:19:01] where were they when god met the woman
[1:19:04] at the well
[1:19:07] told her of herself i
[1:19:10] gave her the revelation she's one of
[1:19:12] them
[1:19:14] huh what about mary when she came
[1:19:17] and found him at simon's house they were
[1:19:20] all gathered around
[1:19:21] but not one of them could touch
[1:19:25] her heart like jesus did
[1:19:30] he said to her woman go your sins are
[1:19:33] forgiven
[1:19:34] go and sin no more no man had anything
[1:19:38] to do with that
[1:19:39] what about the thief on the cross he was
[1:19:42] born free
[1:19:43] every true child of god is born free
[1:19:47] no matter where you get born at
[1:19:51] you're born free god gives the birth
[1:19:55] we admire each other we collect together
[1:19:58] because we're believers
[1:20:00] hallelujah but at the end of the day
[1:20:02] amen because i'm joined in fellowship
[1:20:04] with you
[1:20:04] doesn't doesn't guarantee me salvation
[1:20:08] the only thing that guarantees me
[1:20:09] salvation is that i have met
[1:20:11] jesus christ on his grounds
[1:20:15] that's it hallelujah
[1:20:19] i'm glad to be a christian am i
[1:20:22] fault-free no sir
[1:20:26] in my eyes i see what i mean
[1:20:29] my thoughts are that my faults but in
[1:20:31] his eyes
[1:20:32] i'm perfect
[1:20:35] hallelujah now you can't understand it
[1:20:38] unless you're under the blood hallelujah
[1:20:41] and when you honor the blood
[1:20:44] there's no charge against you why the
[1:20:47] bible says
[1:20:48] there is now no condemnation to those
[1:20:52] who walk
[1:20:53] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:20:55] that means if you got the holy ghost
[1:20:57] your desire is to do what he wants you
[1:20:59] to do you might
[1:21:01] stumble you might fall but god said
[1:21:03] there's no condemnation
[1:21:07] a super race now understand this
[1:21:10] when we say super race everybody puts
[1:21:12] everything here
[1:21:14] and like the problem god said and i'm
[1:21:15] not going to be long tonight but the
[1:21:16] prophet god said this
[1:21:17] he said you know we always look at what
[1:21:19] jesus did yesterday
[1:21:20] and we always look at jesus what he's
[1:21:22] going to do tomorrow
[1:21:24] hallelujah but you know what we forget
[1:21:27] what he's doing today what is he doing
[1:21:30] now i'm gonna tell you what he's doing
[1:21:32] i'm gonna tell you whether you know this
[1:21:34] or not he is
[1:21:35] literally forming and shaping
[1:21:37] individuals
[1:21:38] into his image right before your eyes
[1:21:42] but the truth of the matter is you can't
[1:21:44] see it because it's veiled by human
[1:21:46] flesh
[1:21:49] hallelujah but one all these old days
[1:21:52] the glory that moses had will not be
[1:21:56] even compared
[1:21:57] to the glory that god has for his bride
[1:22:01] is that right when moses came off to
[1:22:03] that mountain
[1:22:04] he had to veil his face because of the
[1:22:06] glory of the lord hallelujah
[1:22:08] and guess what even because of that they
[1:22:11] still talk about moses today
[1:22:13] they forgot to see that there was
[1:22:15] something behind that veil
[1:22:18] that caused moses to glow
[1:22:21] oh jesus help us lord i am so glad to be
[1:22:25] a christian
[1:22:26] i am so so people say satisfied i don't
[1:22:30] wanna i don't understand whether
[1:22:31] satisfied is such a a weak word for me
[1:22:35] because it's more than satisfied i'm
[1:22:37] elated
[1:22:39] huh it illuminates me it causes me it
[1:22:42] causes
[1:22:42] thrills when i think about what god has
[1:22:46] done for me
[1:22:47] and what he's doing for me he said they
[1:22:50] would be so much like him even they will
[1:22:52] be in his
[1:22:53] very image i get that he didn't say
[1:22:56] likeness he said image in other words
[1:22:59] god is working on the inner man
[1:23:01] the christ in you being formed into the
[1:23:04] christ
[1:23:05] right in you the very virtues of god
[1:23:09] being formed and framed in you and we
[1:23:11] know that's victory
[1:23:13] right the father's will pressure
[1:23:16] right turning you around whatever the
[1:23:18] whole point is this
[1:23:20] we are in a in a in a
[1:23:23] process right now where god is creating
[1:23:27] a game
[1:23:30] what is he creating his own son
[1:23:36] jesus christ the beginning of god's
[1:23:40] creation hallelujah what is he doing
[1:23:43] creating
[1:23:44] a game what do you mean what do you mean
[1:23:47] he first created the male
[1:23:49] then he came back and created the female
[1:23:53] from the male right and what is it
[1:23:56] that's why jesus adam said
[1:23:59] to eve you're born in my bone and flesh
[1:24:01] of my flesh
[1:24:02] in other words we're made out of the
[1:24:03] same substance
[1:24:06] my holiness is your holiness the holy
[1:24:08] ghost that
[1:24:09] that causes me to live is the same holy
[1:24:11] ghost you god
[1:24:13] right it is god it's the essence of god
[1:24:16] in us and all god is saying to us
[1:24:21] submit to my word and you'll see the
[1:24:24] glory of god
[1:24:27] right what happened the first son what
[1:24:29] happened to him he failed
[1:24:31] when god came back gave him the word
[1:24:33] test the devil calls him the fall
[1:24:35] understand here was adam and here was
[1:24:37] adam
[1:24:38] mr adam and mrs adam then miss adam fell
[1:24:41] here and in order for them to be united
[1:24:44] mr adam had to come here too because
[1:24:46] they were on this on different planes
[1:24:47] after she failed
[1:24:49] he had to fall in order to unite
[1:24:52] hallelujah but in this case
[1:24:55] our adam is here we're here
[1:24:59] and we must come up hallelujah
[1:25:02] because he's already lowered himself as
[1:25:04] much as he possibly can low himself
[1:25:06] right think about the god of heaven
[1:25:08] becoming the man
[1:25:10] he becomes sin that we might become his
[1:25:12] righteousness
[1:25:13] oh i don't understand it it's like
[1:25:15] people don't understand the gospel
[1:25:17] and the reason why they won't try it or
[1:25:19] want it because they don't understand
[1:25:21] what it is
[1:25:23] people say well i don't want to go to
[1:25:25] hell that ain't it
[1:25:27] nobody really wants to go to hell oh is
[1:25:30] that the truth
[1:25:31] but that ain't it this is a love affair
[1:25:35] god wants someone who's going to love
[1:25:37] him for who he
[1:25:38] is right
[1:25:44] when it comes to the bride of jesus
[1:25:46] christ the lord has eternal vision
[1:25:48] you know what i mean y'all know have you
[1:25:51] seen people with tunnel vision
[1:25:52] you can tell that you can tell that
[1:25:54] person say listen you know
[1:25:56] i think something wrong with her but if
[1:25:58] that guy's in love with her
[1:26:00] you can say all you want to say he can't
[1:26:02] see it and don't want to hear it
[1:26:06] and the only thing that can break tunnel
[1:26:08] vision when you see that there's a
[1:26:09] couple that ain't right
[1:26:11] is prayer because all your talking ain't
[1:26:14] going to do any good
[1:26:15] well let me say like that's that's the
[1:26:17] way god is with us
[1:26:18] satan is the accuser he can say whatever
[1:26:21] he want to say about us
[1:26:22] but god has tunnel vision for us he
[1:26:25] loves us so much
[1:26:27] that no matter what the devil says he
[1:26:30] doesn't listen
[1:26:32] why because god knows those who he came
[1:26:35] to redeem
[1:26:37] hallelujah and he loved us before he
[1:26:40] redeemed us
[1:26:42] oh lord help us jesus i'm taking my time
[1:26:46] understand this that god knew that in
[1:26:48] this flesh
[1:26:50] and you know this flesh is really it's
[1:26:52] kind of like a
[1:26:53] form of a serpent you know he always
[1:26:55] gets you in trouble
[1:26:58] it's a hybrid and i don't care how you
[1:27:00] try to tame it you know what i mean
[1:27:02] it's going to do whatever if we want to
[1:27:03] do that's why paul said kill it
[1:27:06] you have to kill this thing you have to
[1:27:08] put the will of the flesh underneath
[1:27:09] your feet
[1:27:11] every day throughout the day every time
[1:27:13] you try to raise up his head you got to
[1:27:14] bring him down the bible said
[1:27:16] cast down every evil imagination see
[1:27:19] that's where the devil anoints your
[1:27:20] flesh to bring you to
[1:27:22] a place of failure so you have to stop
[1:27:25] him
[1:27:26] right there and how do you stop him oh
[1:27:28] you don't say
[1:27:29] stop speaking in tongues that ain't
[1:27:30] gonna stop the devil
[1:27:33] you can shout and that ain't gonna stop
[1:27:35] him you know the only thing that stops
[1:27:37] the devil is the word
[1:27:40] learn the word and learn how to speak
[1:27:44] the word you don't even have to feel it
[1:27:47] when you
[1:27:47] speak it you don't need a thunderbolt or
[1:27:50] you don't need the hands on your head to
[1:27:51] stand up or to win
[1:27:52] come by speak the word and believe it
[1:27:56] and it'll come to pass
[1:28:00] you love the lord the bible says we're
[1:28:02] more than conquerors and i believe that
[1:28:04] and you know how that is you know the
[1:28:05] story about that
[1:28:06] the man goes to work he makes all the
[1:28:09] money
[1:28:10] right and he comes back home and gives
[1:28:11] his wife the paycheck
[1:28:13] well she's the more than the conqueror
[1:28:17] she didn't have to work for it or sweat
[1:28:18] or brow but she takes the check
[1:28:20] he works for it right so she's more than
[1:28:23] a conqueror
[1:28:23] so my my understanding is this you know
[1:28:26] people say i'm a survivor
[1:28:28] i'm not a survivor
[1:28:31] survivor means that you just bail you
[1:28:33] just made it
[1:28:34] i'm a conqueror that means i had an
[1:28:37] opposition i had an opponent
[1:28:39] and it may have looked like he was going
[1:28:41] to get the best of me but i
[1:28:42] conquered him i defeated him i turned
[1:28:46] the the the whole scene around where
[1:28:49] he's at the bottom
[1:28:50] and i'm on the top at the top jesus
[1:28:53] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:28:55] forever
[1:28:56] we are predestinated that means amen god
[1:29:00] is already determined
[1:29:02] because he knew what we would do right
[1:29:04] he doesn't make any of us serve him
[1:29:06] that's what my brother said uh uh well
[1:29:09] why should i serve a goddess
[1:29:11] that's got to make you serve i say that
[1:29:14] ain't it
[1:29:15] god don't make us serve him everybody
[1:29:18] that have
[1:29:18] hardships and hard times don't come to
[1:29:21] the lord
[1:29:22] no some people heart gets harder
[1:29:26] against god they end up in hell because
[1:29:29] they resist him
[1:29:32] right and never think about who's giving
[1:29:34] them strength who's giving them life
[1:29:36] they never think about who gave them the
[1:29:39] intelligence
[1:29:40] to think and to work and uh they never
[1:29:43] think about
[1:29:44] science science what science got to do
[1:29:46] with it
[1:29:47] like my son said i'm going to worship
[1:29:49] the god that made science
[1:29:52] huh science guy has nothing to do with
[1:29:54] it
[1:29:56] in the beginning god said that's that's
[1:30:00] what it is
[1:30:00] and when we come to a place and people
[1:30:03] well i don't think i want to serve the
[1:30:05] lord because
[1:30:06] you know why you don't want to serve the
[1:30:07] lord you just don't know how good it is
[1:30:11] maybe you haven't seen the right example
[1:30:12] of christianity
[1:30:14] hallelujah but if you get a taste like i
[1:30:16] told somebody
[1:30:17] you get a taste of the holy ghost you'll
[1:30:20] never want anything else
[1:30:22] you know what you're going to do want
[1:30:23] more of it
[1:30:27] hallelujah i used to be afraid of the
[1:30:28] holy ghost what i thought was the holy
[1:30:30] ghost anyway because
[1:30:31] my mama used to shout and speak in
[1:30:33] tongues and jerk and
[1:30:35] i find myself doing the same thing now
[1:30:38] but it used to look like it hurt you
[1:30:39] know
[1:30:40] you know and uh i used to be afraid of
[1:30:42] it and i told her i said lord i'm afraid
[1:30:45] i wasn't ashamed to tell him i was but i
[1:30:47] said but i but i want it
[1:30:49] i didn't know what it was going to be
[1:30:51] like but oh my
[1:30:53] when i got a taste of the holy ghost i
[1:30:54] was dancing everywhere
[1:30:58] i came home speaking in tongues and my
[1:31:00] family say i don't think you're supposed
[1:31:02] to be doing that here dude
[1:31:05] because i was a child i couldn't control
[1:31:06] what i was doing but
[1:31:08] by god's grace oh nothing was going to
[1:31:10] stop me then
[1:31:13] church had a different meaning to it
[1:31:17] blasphemous name each one of these ages
[1:31:20] had that rock confession
[1:31:23] now my thing is this i told you and i've
[1:31:26] said this and i know i'm talking
[1:31:27] and i could be i could i feel like
[1:31:29] preaching but i'm talking
[1:31:31] and but i want you to understand cause i
[1:31:33] really want you to understand
[1:31:35] we cannot stay here you understand me
[1:31:39] wherever you are spiritually you cannot
[1:31:42] stay there
[1:31:44] and expect to make a rapture you
[1:31:47] understand me
[1:31:48] now we know what gets god's attention
[1:31:53] it's when you cry out
[1:31:57] brother branham said there's no other
[1:31:59] way to bring a birth
[1:32:02] right he said it doesn't it doesn't
[1:32:04] matter if you you you you you're being
[1:32:06] born in a decorated
[1:32:08] hospital room it could be pink or blue
[1:32:10] every birth
[1:32:12] is a mess and people don't want the mess
[1:32:16] but let me tell you if you're ashamed
[1:32:17] like one brother says
[1:32:19] brother you know i want the law but
[1:32:21] maybe i'll rent me a hotel room and
[1:32:23] we'll go there and maybe god give me the
[1:32:25] hotel he said uh-uh
[1:32:27] god can give you the holy ghost right
[1:32:30] now
[1:32:31] you mean right here right now
[1:32:34] if god can go to you know a prostitute
[1:32:37] place or
[1:32:38] wherever look through the scripture
[1:32:42] anywhere you can get god you don't have
[1:32:45] to be in a church building
[1:32:46] you can be home in a closet wherever god
[1:32:49] will give you the holy ghost
[1:32:51] if you really want it but the thing uh
[1:32:54] isn't about it
[1:32:55] is that when the change comes you must
[1:32:57] believe that that is to change
[1:32:59] because as soon as you move out from
[1:33:03] that anointing the devil gonna tell you
[1:33:05] you didn't get nothing
[1:33:08] he strips you and you will allow him to
[1:33:11] strip you with his words
[1:33:13] my point is how would he ever know
[1:33:16] what you got because he can't go
[1:33:20] there he can't go there
[1:33:24] if he can come behind the blood he's
[1:33:26] then your brother
[1:33:27] so how he gonna tell you what you didn't
[1:33:30] get
[1:33:30] when it's veiled to him
[1:33:34] you can't see he can't see what's in
[1:33:37] your heart
[1:33:37] he can't see it
[1:33:42] but understand what was happening now
[1:33:45] we're moving
[1:33:46] from glory to glory
[1:33:49] and all of us want to be changed in a
[1:33:51] moment of a twinkling of an eye
[1:33:52] it's coming
[1:33:56] but we're now in the process of moving
[1:33:59] up that ladder walking like enoch
[1:34:03] y'all hear me walking like enoch
[1:34:07] the bible never brings out enoch's
[1:34:09] failures and thoughts
[1:34:12] but you better believe he was a man
[1:34:15] hallelujah
[1:34:16] but he walked with god and the bible
[1:34:18] said if you walk in the light
[1:34:21] as he is in the light you have
[1:34:23] fellowship one with another
[1:34:25] and the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:34:27] you from
[1:34:28] all of your unrighteousness so as you
[1:34:31] walk in the
[1:34:32] light you might have failures and
[1:34:33] thoughts but that blood is there washing
[1:34:36] cleansing you every step of the way
[1:34:40] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:34:44] he said then this is what he said
[1:34:46] because i want you to understand by
[1:34:48] god's grace
[1:34:49] we're moving into an area that a lot of
[1:34:51] people are not understanding they can't
[1:34:53] see it
[1:34:54] and it's okay it's meant for those who
[1:34:56] can't see
[1:34:57] the point is is that this is we're cloak
[1:35:00] the time of uh we're closing in on this
[1:35:03] rapture
[1:35:04] on this trial on this translation it's
[1:35:07] really getting closer
[1:35:08] much closer than you think
[1:35:11] hallelujah but brother branham goes on
[1:35:14] and says
[1:35:15] the saints are sleeping waiting
[1:35:18] waiting waiting waiting see
[1:35:22] until this age been waiting for this age
[1:35:26] do you really think that god is going to
[1:35:29] rapture a church
[1:35:30] that's living in the glare of another
[1:35:32] age
[1:35:33] pentecostal age is over
[1:35:37] we can't live in that age we go beyond
[1:35:39] that
[1:35:40] then if we're going beyond that what are
[1:35:42] we looking for
[1:35:44] we're looking for the image we're
[1:35:46] looking for the very
[1:35:47] image and likeness of god to be formed
[1:35:50] into
[1:35:51] us that's why brother said we've we've
[1:35:53] had all of that
[1:35:54] we've had the singing we've had the
[1:35:56] shouting we had the dancing
[1:35:58] and we still got some of it right but
[1:36:01] that ain't it
[1:36:04] he said they do stuff like that at the
[1:36:06] football games
[1:36:09] yeah that ain't it
[1:36:12] it's all good what we experienced the
[1:36:15] other night there
[1:36:16] in service i really enjoyed myself that
[1:36:18] that ain't it
[1:36:19] that ain't all of it it's good to be
[1:36:22] able to do those things but that ain't
[1:36:24] that's not
[1:36:25] it there's a life that god want to see
[1:36:28] in us and it must be that is the token
[1:36:34] that is the token people it is the life
[1:36:37] of christ
[1:36:38] in us
[1:36:42] glory to god he said but soon the holy
[1:36:46] ghost being poured out from christ
[1:36:48] will come and will seal up the church
[1:36:53] whoo he said it's coming
[1:36:56] i know a lot of people ain't looking for
[1:36:58] nothing but it's coming
[1:37:00] right then the church then that's why i
[1:37:03] said it's coming because he said
[1:37:05] then the church will be raptured it'll
[1:37:08] be a complete
[1:37:09] unit of god hallelujah
[1:37:12] a bride for christ who will be the head
[1:37:16] of all things amen
[1:37:19] huh it's coming but
[1:37:22] we're pressing as it's pressing we'll
[1:37:25] meet each other right
[1:37:27] that's the way our wedding is we meet
[1:37:29] each other
[1:37:32] overcomers right to get the better of a
[1:37:35] struggle
[1:37:36] you got to get the best of this struggle
[1:37:39] or conflict
[1:37:40] it means to conquer it means to defeat
[1:37:44] hallelujah he overcame the enemy
[1:37:47] what was it because you were in a battle
[1:37:51] and we know we're going to have battles
[1:37:53] hallelujah
[1:37:55] that's why we're called soldiers that's
[1:37:57] why paul said put on the whole armor of
[1:38:00] god
[1:38:01] that you may be able to stand against
[1:38:03] the wiles of the devil
[1:38:04] these tricks and things that he's
[1:38:06] putting before us he said
[1:38:08] listen but and a survival is one that
[1:38:11] just
[1:38:12] i put this way endure it's like a man
[1:38:15] stranded out on an
[1:38:16] island and you know you somebody find
[1:38:19] you and you just
[1:38:20] a few breaths from death but a conqueror
[1:38:24] if he conquered the island you'll find
[1:38:27] him but he's got his campfire and his
[1:38:29] meat on the fire
[1:38:31] right because he's conquered it
[1:38:35] hallelujah like i said of some things
[1:38:37] i've already said
[1:38:38] but when it comes to the power of god we
[1:38:40] must learn this bible is the power it's
[1:38:44] god written
[1:38:46] and jesus didn't pull out a wand or he
[1:38:48] didn't pull out nothing
[1:38:49] he said well i tell you what you know he
[1:38:51] didn't go through all of this stuff and
[1:38:53] you know
[1:38:54] thus said the lord no he said it is
[1:38:56] written
[1:38:58] how simple can you get it how simple can
[1:39:01] any of us get it
[1:39:02] it's written and if we could take it
[1:39:04] within our hearts like that people of
[1:39:06] god
[1:39:06] do you know the victory that we'll have
[1:39:09] the struggles you have to go because
[1:39:12] when you resist the devil the devil will
[1:39:13] flee from you
[1:39:15] that's about y'all believe that i
[1:39:17] believe that
[1:39:21] he said listen yet the father could have
[1:39:23] spoke anything through him
[1:39:24] but he never used it he used the
[1:39:27] father's written word
[1:39:28] and he never used his power but he used
[1:39:31] god's word and said
[1:39:33] it is written you understand me he
[1:39:36] didn't feel no swelling of the holy
[1:39:38] ghost coming up in him
[1:39:39] he just spoke it
[1:39:44] it is written why because the word is
[1:39:47] life
[1:39:49] it cannot be defeated it cannot be
[1:39:52] conquered
[1:39:53] it cannot be contained hallelujah
[1:39:57] that's what makes us different from the
[1:39:58] oneness the oneness believed that god is
[1:40:01] like on your finger that's impossible
[1:40:03] you can't put god in a box hallelujah
[1:40:06] he cannot be contained even though the
[1:40:08] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:40:10] was in him that means the very essence
[1:40:12] was god of all god was in him but still
[1:40:14] god was
[1:40:20] everywhere
[1:40:22] can you imagine space and time
[1:40:25] god created that and our little p brains
[1:40:28] cannot even understand space and time
[1:40:31] that's what gets me about scientists
[1:40:32] they think they dig
[1:40:35] they deep deep deep deep because they
[1:40:37] understand space and times and quantum
[1:40:39] theories and all of that and they don't
[1:40:40] forget they who who made it
[1:40:46] my brother branham said it like this
[1:40:48] it's the truth they think they know up
[1:40:50] and they know down
[1:40:52] he said but who's to say what's up and
[1:40:54] what's down everything is in space
[1:40:59] so your up could be down and your down
[1:41:01] could be up
[1:41:03] right only god knows what's up and down
[1:41:08] it is true and we look at this and we
[1:41:11] say oh brother brooks
[1:41:12] what's wrong with you you know what let
[1:41:14] me say like this people of god we must
[1:41:16] focus our mind on the rapture
[1:41:18] we must focus our mind on on translation
[1:41:21] right even the animals knows when it's
[1:41:23] time to mate
[1:41:26] is that right i mean the trout would go
[1:41:28] all the way upstream
[1:41:30] knowing that once you get up there he's
[1:41:31] gonna they're gonna have
[1:41:33] some the sperm thing on and he gonna die
[1:41:35] he knows it
[1:41:37] but there's nothing that can stop him
[1:41:40] from going upstream
[1:41:43] rainbow trout is that what you are
[1:41:45] nothing going to stop you right
[1:41:47] right amen it's going to be tough it's
[1:41:50] going to be hard but it's in you you're
[1:41:51] a conqueror
[1:41:54] hallelujah amen i can be identified with
[1:41:58] this message
[1:42:00] you know people have a hard time when
[1:42:01] brother branham talk about squirrels and
[1:42:03] all of that
[1:42:04] if you see the way i'm spelling
[1:42:05] squirrels up here and you're like
[1:42:06] brother you need to go back to school
[1:42:09] i'm really seeing the thing like that
[1:42:11] ain't right but anyhow
[1:42:13] if you understood when brother brown
[1:42:16] preached and he talked about squirrels
[1:42:18] people said well i don't believe i
[1:42:20] believe it
[1:42:22] like i was saying this morning do y'all
[1:42:24] realize there was an
[1:42:25] ice storm coming here during the new new
[1:42:28] years they expected snow and ice
[1:42:30] guess what somebody prayed i was one of
[1:42:33] them
[1:42:34] i wanted to have church it missed us
[1:42:40] do you think that was coincidental oh no
[1:42:43] i i know don't y'all some of the ones
[1:42:45] the old saints i say oh
[1:42:46] those who were with me when i first came
[1:42:49] how many times we prayed storms away
[1:42:51] from this place
[1:42:52] and even the the news people said we
[1:42:55] don't know what happened
[1:42:56] hey but here at higher ground we know
[1:43:00] god we prayed we spoke it it went
[1:43:04] hallelujah little fishy how many of
[1:43:06] y'all believe that
[1:43:08] a dead fish raised back to death life
[1:43:11] and if
[1:43:11] god does that for a fish what about you
[1:43:14] and i do you
[1:43:15] don't you understand in his image and
[1:43:18] his likeness
[1:43:19] god cares more for you than he does the
[1:43:21] sparrow
[1:43:22] that's what he said he said listen i
[1:43:24] feed the sparrow and i clothe the field
[1:43:26] with flowers and don't you think i'll
[1:43:28] clothe you and don't you think i'll feed
[1:43:29] you
[1:43:30] and don't but you know what let me tell
[1:43:31] you something
[1:43:34] i can boast on him a little bit
[1:43:37] since this coronavirus uh cobic came you
[1:43:41] know
[1:43:43] you know how so many people have been
[1:43:44] out of jobs
[1:43:46] things have been happening financial but
[1:43:48] let me tell you like this in a nutshell
[1:43:50] god has never left himself without a
[1:43:52] witness
[1:43:54] i am a man to say that god knows how to
[1:43:56] take care of me
[1:43:57] [Laughter]
[1:43:59] amen times i said the devil tried to
[1:44:02] make you worry oh but how this is going
[1:44:04] to happen
[1:44:04] all of a sudden something come in from
[1:44:06] somewhere
[1:44:08] people you have no idea but i've even
[1:44:11] had people
[1:44:12] you've been on my heart brother brooks
[1:44:15] call me
[1:44:20] that's what i'm talking about you talk
[1:44:22] to god and god
[1:44:23] but god will fix it for you you don't
[1:44:26] have to feel it
[1:44:27] speak it is this is elementary i know
[1:44:31] but i'm
[1:44:31] i'm bringing us up to something brother
[1:44:34] battle was praying with the people he
[1:44:35] says i'm gonna put
[1:44:37] the right words in your mouth he started
[1:44:40] praying i'm gonna
[1:44:41] i'm gonna put the right words in your
[1:44:44] mouth i'm gonna tell you what to say to
[1:44:46] get the results
[1:44:48] when i read that i'm like oh that's
[1:44:50] pretty
[1:44:51] oh yes i'm gonna put the right words in
[1:44:54] your mouth to get the right results
[1:44:58] and all he did was pray a prayer of
[1:45:00] faith
[1:45:01] he said everything in a positive way
[1:45:05] and ended up with jesus christ
[1:45:08] and it happened in closing
[1:45:12] and the word will defeat the devil
[1:45:14] anywhere
[1:45:16] anytime under any condition
[1:45:19] hallelujah i don't i've told you folks
[1:45:22] we're at that place where samson was
[1:45:25] you got to realize you defeated and
[1:45:28] without god coming down
[1:45:30] to do something special for you amen
[1:45:33] you're a failure ha
[1:45:36] we're at a place we should be on fire
[1:45:40] fire but the philistines those demons
[1:45:46] has affected us in one way or another
[1:45:49] and if we don't cry out oh lord once
[1:45:51] more people say you crazy brother
[1:45:53] yes maybe i am but i know one thing
[1:45:57] i know one thing just by you know your
[1:46:00] body language tells everything
[1:46:02] you you speak with your body you know
[1:46:05] nobody goes away
[1:46:06] do you have joy in your life
[1:46:13] your body tells you know when you you
[1:46:16] know you see people that listen
[1:46:18] you the crossing of your legs the
[1:46:19] crossing of your arms all of those
[1:46:21] things you shutting god out and don't
[1:46:23] even realize it
[1:46:24] you're speaking you're speaking things
[1:46:28] and don't realize you you you your
[1:46:30] disposition
[1:46:31] is giving you a way you might be hearing
[1:46:34] here
[1:46:35] but you're not making it it's not making
[1:46:37] it here because when it makes here
[1:46:39] everything comes alive
[1:46:41] it's like turning on the light it's true
[1:46:46] you you go ask anybody who knows how to
[1:46:48] read bodies that's how some people
[1:46:50] you know that's why some people they can
[1:46:51] work at a bank and they can tell a crook
[1:46:53] before he comes in the door just by the
[1:46:55] way he walks
[1:46:57] they know the body language he may he
[1:47:00] may be in a business suit
[1:47:02] and if that person understand people and
[1:47:05] the way they talk with their body
[1:47:07] it gives them away the shifting of the
[1:47:10] everything
[1:47:10] plays a part in reading but anyway let's
[1:47:13] move on
[1:47:15] but jesus proved it when he defeated the
[1:47:18] devil the devil
[1:47:19] not using his power but just use just
[1:47:22] but just
[1:47:23] on the word of the father it is written
[1:47:27] it is written now when satan comes into
[1:47:30] you
[1:47:30] or trying to come to you you must remind
[1:47:32] him you are a super church
[1:47:34] you are the blood of jesus christ
[1:47:38] by the spirit you are undefeated
[1:47:42] invincible untouchable
[1:47:46] and nothing he can do like paul said can
[1:47:49] separate me from the love of god
[1:47:51] it's not my works he that begun the good
[1:47:54] work
[1:47:55] in you is faithful to complete it don't
[1:47:58] don't think god gonna fail you he cannot
[1:48:00] fail you
[1:48:01] and god doesn't change his mind he's
[1:48:03] perfect when it comes to choosing you
[1:48:06] god doesn't change his mind not about
[1:48:10] you
[1:48:11] when he was on the cross you were on his
[1:48:15] mind
[1:48:17] way before you got here long before you
[1:48:20] got here
[1:48:21] he saw you hallelujah now coming down to
[1:48:25] close
[1:48:25] what is he doing now he changed his mask
[1:48:29] william branham is gone thank god for
[1:48:32] the man i
[1:48:33] i i longed to see him in that
[1:48:36] resurrection
[1:48:38] but when he changed his mask he moved
[1:48:40] into what we call the bride form
[1:48:44] the bride age the bride of jesus christ
[1:48:49] and right now each one of us if you have
[1:48:52] the holy ghost each one of us
[1:48:53] is wearing we are the mask of god we are
[1:48:57] that
[1:48:57] that being that's veiling god is that
[1:48:59] right know ye not that you are the
[1:49:01] temple of god
[1:49:03] hallelujah but you understand when he
[1:49:06] changes his mask he never changes his
[1:49:08] character
[1:49:09] he never changes his nature whatever he
[1:49:12] was
[1:49:12] yesterday he is today that's why you
[1:49:15] that's how you know when you got it
[1:49:17] because whatever he was doing yesterday
[1:49:19] he's doing it today
[1:49:20] right we are invincible whatever he's
[1:49:23] still healing the sick
[1:49:24] he's still raising the dead he's still
[1:49:26] loving the unlovable
[1:49:28] hallelujah and you know what jesus still
[1:49:31] witnessing
[1:49:33] he went all out of his way to meet a
[1:49:36] woman at the well
[1:49:38] right he witnessed to all of his
[1:49:40] disciples he didn't send nobody there to
[1:49:42] them
[1:49:43] he came by john peter james all of them
[1:49:46] he himself drew them by his word
[1:49:49] come follow me he did it yesterday he's
[1:49:53] doing it today
[1:49:54] right so let's move on we're looking
[1:49:58] at something that's real and like i said
[1:50:01] i've seen every kind of religion i'm
[1:50:03] closing now
[1:50:04] i've seen every kind of religion there
[1:50:06] there is onward christian soldier
[1:50:09] marching as the war letting god letting
[1:50:12] go and letting god
[1:50:13] uh change us from glory to glory
[1:50:17] to glory to glory how do you know when
[1:50:20] there's ever human effort
[1:50:21] when there's ever human effort you'll
[1:50:23] find yourself falling backwards
[1:50:25] but when god changes it it's a real
[1:50:27] change
[1:50:28] that's what james says james said that
[1:50:31] we're drawn away with our own lust and
[1:50:33] entice
[1:50:34] right but when god takes away the lust
[1:50:37] enticed
[1:50:38] he takes away the thing the darkness in
[1:50:40] you that brings the lust and entice
[1:50:42] and when he takes that away from you
[1:50:44] like i was telling somebody i used to
[1:50:46] love to drink when i was young
[1:50:48] you know what i mean and and and perhaps
[1:50:52] i know it was a habit but i'll say it
[1:50:54] like this
[1:50:56] when god took it away he took it away
[1:51:00] i can drink real wine and never
[1:51:03] have a desire to drink it otherwise
[1:51:06] other than
[1:51:06] in communion i don't drink that when i
[1:51:08] say oh my goodness
[1:51:10] i'm i shouldn't have done that i'm a
[1:51:13] recovering alcoholic
[1:51:14] no i'm not a recovering alcoholic i
[1:51:17] never was a recovering alcoholic
[1:51:21] god delivered and when god delivered you
[1:51:25] can drink as much wine as you want to
[1:51:27] y'all understand me
[1:51:31] and never be a alcoholic he takes the
[1:51:33] alcoholic spirit out of you
[1:51:35] right so when it comes to communion you
[1:51:38] know people say well you know i can't
[1:51:39] take communion if it's real wine i can't
[1:51:41] do it because
[1:51:42] i used to be an alcoholic you haven't
[1:51:43] been delivered yet
[1:51:46] right i can go around well i never was a
[1:51:49] smoker i hated cigarettes anyway
[1:51:52] you know and stuff like that i i don't
[1:51:54] even know why people do it it's so gross
[1:51:55] but nevertheless you know that was one
[1:51:57] thing i know well you know when i go
[1:51:59] back round somebody name you hear that
[1:52:01] i remember being in in in um
[1:52:05] one thing about south america and the
[1:52:07] islands y'all think they play the music
[1:52:10] loud here
[1:52:12] it's on a different scale your house
[1:52:15] shakes
[1:52:16] your house dance your bed rocks
[1:52:20] it is so loud you think to yourself
[1:52:23] i'm gonna lose my hearing you can't even
[1:52:26] think
[1:52:28] i'm i'm laughing but i'm telling you
[1:52:31] it's the truth it's what i experienced
[1:52:34] and
[1:52:34] that's one of those things i have to be
[1:52:36] well prepared for when i go to those
[1:52:38] islands or go to uh
[1:52:39] or south america because i know they
[1:52:41] play their music
[1:52:42] they got drum decibels that you where
[1:52:45] it's against the law to play
[1:52:47] to take it to in this america and you
[1:52:49] don't if you not holy ghost field
[1:52:52] it's going to overtake you
[1:52:55] the next thing you'll do you'll see your
[1:52:57] mind and you yourself and your mind
[1:52:59] moving to the beat
[1:53:01] i'm telling you it's just that bad you
[1:53:03] have no control of it
[1:53:06] it will control you
[1:53:09] right but what i'm trying to say is you
[1:53:12] know
[1:53:12] there's not been a time i've ever gone
[1:53:14] and i want to go out there and just
[1:53:16] move why because god took it out of me
[1:53:21] he took it out of me and i'm saying when
[1:53:25] this is what we want we don't want a
[1:53:27] patched up job we want god to take
[1:53:30] all the darkness out of us
[1:53:34] and when he does fill us with his light
[1:53:37] don't leave
[1:53:38] us with an empty space but fill us with
[1:53:41] all of his life let's stand
[1:53:45] i i don't know whether all i know is
[1:53:48] i just know what he's doing in me
[1:53:53] he's changing me like the scripture says
[1:53:56] from glory
[1:53:58] to glory and i feel real good tonight
[1:54:03] in spite of having a rough
[1:54:07] sleep last night i feel real good
[1:54:12] and i know that the way i feel is is
[1:54:15] supernatural
[1:54:16] it ain't from the coffee
[1:54:19] but it's from god and i want to see
[1:54:24] everybody happy i was telling
[1:54:27] the church in iowa city we should never
[1:54:30] leave church safe
[1:54:32] that's that's that's
[1:54:36] it would be a disrespectful thing to be
[1:54:38] in the presence of the lord and then
[1:54:39] leave out of his presence saying
[1:54:42] i can't explain it it's it's degrading
[1:54:46] you mean to tell me you come to church
[1:54:50] and you leave in church you you're so
[1:54:51] unhappy
[1:54:53] you don't even know what to do and i
[1:54:54] think to myself lord
[1:54:56] that's why i said i'm going to be trying
[1:54:59] out my best to preach on a positive
[1:55:00] note we all get beat up during the
[1:55:03] daytime
[1:55:04] and every one of us know our
[1:55:05] shortcomings and our sins i'm going to
[1:55:07] call it out when god tells me
[1:55:09] but i want to bring something that's
[1:55:10] going to encourage you to to understand
[1:55:13] it is the goodness of god
[1:55:15] that should lead men unto repentance
[1:55:19] because i think about if i'm preaching
[1:55:21] on you and i'm really hard with it and
[1:55:23] you got a stubborn spirit i'm making you
[1:55:25] worse
[1:55:27] but maybe i can put some love in it some
[1:55:30] honey in the rock
[1:55:33] hallelujah and we can have some good
[1:55:34] fellowship around jesus
[1:55:36] if we can get people to the place that
[1:55:39] they will stop allowing the devil to
[1:55:42] condemn them
[1:55:44] we'll be all right because let's let me
[1:55:47] tell you something he works really hard
[1:55:49] on you before you come to church
[1:55:51] so he can condemn you so that when you
[1:55:52] could get in church you can't worship
[1:55:55] he imprisoned you by your own feelings
[1:55:58] and your shortcomings you got to
[1:55:59] understand
[1:56:00] god don't just run to the altar every
[1:56:01] time you fail
[1:56:03] he the bible said he shed his blood once
[1:56:05] and for all
[1:56:07] once involved i don't know if there's
[1:56:09] somebody that desired prayer
[1:56:12] would be more than happy to pray for you
[1:56:13] i want you to always pray for me i need
[1:56:15] your prayer all the time
[1:56:17] if you think you're going through
[1:56:18] something think about me
[1:56:21] being the pastor and every time a demon
[1:56:23] is cast out of you i
[1:56:24] he come by my house
[1:56:28] that's why sometimes i know what your
[1:56:29] failures are i know what your
[1:56:30] shortcomings are
[1:56:31] because i know what and and it's so
[1:56:33] amazing you get prayer and the devil is
[1:56:36] cast out
[1:56:36] and you don't even know he's gone some
[1:56:39] people don't even know he's gone
[1:56:42] because they're going by their feelings
[1:56:44] you can't go by your feelings
[1:56:47] faith is what makes him gone
[1:56:50] you understand me when the word of god
[1:56:52] is preached when the word of god has
[1:56:54] prayed over you
[1:56:55] at that moment in time if you really are
[1:56:57] a believer
[1:56:58] satan just left he has to
[1:57:02] and you got to believe he's gone because
[1:57:04] if he doesn't he's coming back and
[1:57:06] bringing his buddies with him
[1:57:07] now the stronghold is stronger than it
[1:57:09] was the last time
[1:57:11] because you're basing your victory upon
[1:57:14] your
[1:57:14] feelings and your feelings will always
[1:57:18] deceive you
[1:57:20] you love the lord in moments like
[1:57:24] these in moments like
[1:57:30] i'll sing
[1:57:50] i lived up
[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:32] ah
[1:58:37] [Music]
