[Applause] up there i think this is it sister amen and that's you have your piece of paper because i'll don't god bless you i'm excited about being here with you it's been a long time too long and but i remember all most of all the faces here in the building tonight so we're not strangers uh this is a song that we just started learning at our church brother harold brown he passed a few weeks ago a couple of months ago and this was one of his favorite songs and so we picked it up and i wanted to share it with you and that way you all can start learning a new course [Music] so [Music] is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] uh grace [Music] um [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] you [Music] [Music] so [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] so so several of you know probably here in the room but some of you may not a number of years ago my grandmother was driving down the road and she had never heard the word theophany never she know anything about it didn't know what it was had never heard of it nobody was preaching about theophany at that time so she pulled over to the side of the road and she wrote these words in this psalm book and grandma has been gone this coming may will be 20 years she was called home but she did exactly what god wanted her to do and she has shared several songs but this one particular song was traveled around the world i've heard it in several different languages several different ways and i am by no means her but uh i promised her when she was getting ready to cross over that i would keep sharing her songs and i know brother brooks does a wonderful rendition of this but i wanted to share it with you i tried to look for other songs and it passed by my way in three different places in a song book so i said this is what we'll do one day [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so so so so so [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] amen praise the lord amen thank you for a wonderful grandmother amen the lord used grandmother to give us that song and i'm sure other psalms amen let's just sing that song reign god good amen hallelujah is our brother isaiah gets ready to come amen and maybe he has a smile oh ain't god loving praise oh me is is is is [Music] maybe a little bit too loud now but uh you can just hear me for sure hallelujah you may be seated we we encountered an honor and a privilege to have our sister angela senor here um and her friend sandra we had a lovely uh supper or dinner yesterday and i had not laughed so hard in my life it was medicine to my bones i'm telling you it was and we enjoyed every moment of it and on top of that the shrimp and the onion rings was number one yeah so god was good to us and i appreciate her stopping in to see her she comes occasionally [Laughter] since angela goes way back her uh when those my children were little children and she would take them and give us a little break at times when we were in west virginia and we thank god it uh uh during that time we would go to uh brother charlie spencer's place and all and she would meet us there and we would have a good time and i guess yesterday i found out why she was taking the kids because they would stuff us all in one room and she was giving us [Laughter] and it was true it was true so god was good to us and you know her her her grandma's sister craighead uh was a wonderful lady and and like i told sister angela nobody can sing my theophany like she could and she'll hit a note and she would spin like that it was all over then [Laughter] but yeah when i first heard i sing that song i'm like yes that's mine [Laughter] i will be singing that song and i guess i sung it so long and so much people thought i wrote it but i would always correct them by god's grace no it was sister craighead that uh we came to know as a wonderful sister in the lord and um she's been going for a while but her presence is always with us and her memories uh so we thank god for her and we thank god for sister sandra coming and the saddest part about sister sandra is that she doesn't sing [Laughter] otherwise you know would have her give us a selection as well um give me the key of c um [Music] may i have your attention i like to introduce is is is is [Music] arena i will never count him out is is hallelujah hallelujah i am so grateful that he is my champion i could not have done this myself i needed him and i will always need him throughout eternity i need him and i will always [Music] stand in honor of the word normally as a first song i can't do it god did that and i thank god for giving us the grace we ask that you turn with us to ii corinthians we appreciate the musicians always the song leaders there's a time we didn't have much but you know god has blessed us and uh you know we're grateful we're grateful for everything you know it's it's amazing i find god amazing i know we shouldn't look at him in all because he is what he is but when i think about the transformation and the changes that he's made in my life i give god all the glory i could not have done it i have no change in me except the changer and i thank god for the grace of god amen second corinthians 3 we're going to read from on the 17th verse a thought came to my mind today i had been listening to other things and various thoughts that uh that just got my mind and caught my mind and my attention you know we've been working on you know uh the changing into the image of god you know the basically the capstone and what god has been doing in this last day what makes our message different from laodicea's message and uh the reason why we follow malachi for our teachings and you know why we stand the way we stand enzo doing it has made us an oddball we're different from all others and people don't understand why but the reason being is because god has made the difference uh to be chosen and elected by god to be bright is the greatest honor uh one could ever have in this life and i i believe that i am chosen i believe that i have been elected uh for uh the the great celebration amen and i believe that at this day and time the bride is making herself ready second corinthians 3 beginning at the 17th verse now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord let us pray father god what can we say all of the praise and all of the glory that we could ever allow to come out of our lips will never be enough to express who you really are and what you deserve i've had and heard a songwriter said if i had ten thousand tongues i would praise you with everyone but even with that saying it still will not be enough father there is no way to express our appreciation to you other than to live this life and father that's what we're asking you tonight in our praise and our worship we're asking you to live live in us live through us that your glory may be seen through and by us and so we surrender the service into your hands we say oh god have thine own way in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i was thinking today how the people so many people you know just hate the bible especially in this age of liber you know of the liberals yeah i saw on the news the other day how they're burning down churches in canada and nothing's really being done you know canada is like a twin sister to america you know basically what goes on there is coming here we know the end of what this thing is going to turn into the persecution of the true bride of jesus christ but we do know that at that time is when we when our lover shall appear amen and he's going to change these old bodies from mortal immortality i had a thought and the thought is observing the mirror or the reflection in the mirror and when we talk about a reflection it's it's a throwing back by a body or surface of light heat or sound without absorbing it everybody loves the mirror almost everybody loves the mirror you want a kind of mirror that's going to show the real reflection of you some mirrors will enhance your looks and some will do just the opposite but we like the kind that's going to really give us a little enhancement and oftentimes those mirrors will do that you know by way of the light that's striking it and uh but we look and every day i'm sure every one of us look in the mirror i hope so anyway because by looking in the mirror you checking everything out to make sure that everything is in order and you're the one that's going to approve the image in the mirror you're the one that's going to judge what you're seeing and sometimes when i'm looking in the mirror i says lord have mercy sometimes even to myself i look rough but i'm talking tonight about the mirror of the word this word of god is not something that's just placed in a book matter of fact this is not all of him because the scripture says that if everything written of him was written we would not been able to contain the books and that was written yesterday what about the things that uh god is doing today things that people don't even know about yet and still god is fulfilling his word god has never failed us and he never will this message or this bible in itself is an emancipator it will set and make you free amen you and i sometimes we don't understand why we need to read the bible because we the bible says the truth will make you free those of us i mean i'm sure all of us have been in bondage in some way or another psychology couldn't do it mind over matter couldn't do it mama couldn't do it and daddy couldn't do it many times they tried to drive those demons and devils out of our lives and they couldn't do it you understand me but the only thing that can and will do it is this jesus said if any man come unto me i will in no wise cast him out i believe that with all of my heart before we came to christ we were all slaves people are afraid of that word but it's true we were all slaves to sin you know what the master would tell us to do is what we did there was no argument there was nothing in us to refuse what he wanted to be done we didn't have god but we had him and you must understand that this guy who had us in slavery must die amen he must die in your life because there is a law that you cannot marry jesus having another husband and that's exactly what the devil was to us before we became christians he was our husband he was our master he was our ruler he was our slave master we worked for him we're talking about making a rapture and we understand by god's grace it is the grace of god but songs of solomon said and that this this bride of jesus christ will be a mature bride there will be no flaws in her now i want you to think about it because even now without the blood of jesus we can see flaws but understand the blood has come to excuse me perfect you the life of the blood rather we call it the holy ghost but what is the holy ghost if it doesn't bring a change in your life the holy ghost is life it is god even though the world might want to see it as a second person or a third person it is the person it is the spirit that that the logos came out from is that right because jesus said i go come from my father and i go back to my father and when he came back on the day of pentecost he was the pillar of fire amen so you and i must understand by god's grace amen that there is nothing that can change you outside the holy ghost and the holy ghost is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god amen and it still is amen so you and i must understand that we're the spirit of the lord and we i'm gonna kind of interchange this because the spirit in the words insane we're not talking about you know the rhema we're talking about the logos we're talking about that word that lives we're not talking about the written part of it this bible can be burned but you could never burn god you could never destroy god because god is a spirit y'all understand me so what i'm trying to say is when you've got the holy ghost the holy ghost will change you you don't change yourself it changes you hallelujah it's amazing how so many people with the holy ghost constantly trying to change himself you know what we are kings [Music] you know what the king has to do stretch himself like a cross and he's got everybody around him who's dressing him putting on his shirt put y'all understand me a king doesn't even label to dress himself he has those who are ordained to address him oh that's good i feel like shouting john right now because you and i must understand amen that when we under we come in contact with god it is god who does he does the work he worketh he has the only laboring we do as christian is to enter into his rest according to hebrew but we work so hard and most of the time we're in his way this is grace and this is not law this is grace and you can't mix the two the devil will call you a hypocrite because you love grace let him call you dad if he wants to because i'm sure he's called you worse things than that but you must understand amen under through his eyes it looks hypocritical but in the through the eyes of god he says i find no fault y'all understand me we've already been examined is that right when they took jesus amen from judgment hall to judgment hall what were they doing examining his body they were examining him to make sure to see if he had any faults but you see they could find no fault y'all understand me and you and i we are the body of christ even then they couldn't find no fault the bible says who shall lay any charge to god's elect it is god who justify it and the thing about it is we work so hard and that's the problem if we would pray like we ought to it would bring us to a rest it will stop us from laboring in places we we don't need to labor israel got in trouble with god because they did not know how to honor the day of rest understand me and we don't have a day of rest jesus christ the holy ghost is our sabbath he is our rest and when you get the holy ghost you're supposed to rest from all of your labor when you rest from your labor you're happy i can tell you that yesterday those shrimps were the best shrimps i had in the perhaps ever i'm not a shrimp lover but i love those i enjoyed those now i'm saying that why because i was laying back i was resting and it was a good rest so let me move on by god's grace so you and i unders must understand we're not you know when we were born into this world we came by way of the tree of god good and evil because remember in the beginning it was just a good tree that was adam and eve there were good trees there was a another tree the knowledge of good and evil that was a bad tree and in that mixing we became good and evil that's what god said now they have become like gods they have become like us they know good from evil [Music] and ever since we came into this world we've been fighting even with ourselves good and evil right paul says listen even when i tried to do good when i wanted to do good evil was always there right oh it's true even when you're doing good to others evil is always there trying to influence you hallelujah but here in the word of god there is a solution to it and by god's grace i trust that god would give us the spirit of utterance in matthew 7 8 through 18 through 19 says a good tree cannot bring forth good fruit excuse me evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth i got it mixed up right a good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is you down and cast into the fire y'all understand me so we're not in the age of good and evil amen right from death unto life and he became the tree of death because by every birth a woman comes from amen you're going to die that's it but there was one tree he said if you eat of me you will never die you'll live forever hallelujah now i want you to understand though this flesh might lay down brother bruce could never die don't cry over me like i'm dead you know sir done died already anyway let's move on amen matthew 12 33 says neither make the tree good excuse me either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known of his fruit now that's where i'm at when you look in the mirror what are the fruits what are you looking at when you look into the word of god it will define you it will separate you hallelujah you understand me it will allow you to see who you are what you are amen hallelujah it is that's the word without the preaching of the word you'll never know you're a sinner it's the preaching of the word it's the word that brings light to us is that all right people used to say years ago oh i thank the lord for delivering me a from a miserable life of sin but my life never became miserable until the word came into my life amen you'll still enjoy sin when that's all he knows but once the word comes in the light comes in and it brings a little conviction then and only then you could never be the same right amen it changes you when you know truth because the truth will make you free hallelujah saint john 8 31 says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free not set make you free right and what is truth that's the truth what is truth jesus says i'm truth i'm the truth and i'm the way i am the light is that right amen is that right amen you know brother branham said it like this he said a good he said a true mount transfiguration experience doesn't glorify moses doesn't glorify elijah it only glorified jesus christ himself that's the only one and though we all work together like i was saying the other day i said yesterday we was at the table and god was using us amen you say oh lord when you know one day god gonna use me god using you now amen it's just that simple god is using you now we're looking for these you know dividing of the waters turning water into wine raising the dead what about the woman who brought forth her few pennies what about the woman a man who who had no physician that could heal her and she went and touched the hem of his garment hallelujah y'all understand me simple things even mary who who didn't know that god was using her when she said uh would you do something about this at this wedding we need some wine and all we've got is water hallelujah you see that that wasn't chance that was ordained by god because that was supposed to be the first miracle and god worked it just that way y'all understand me see what we fail to do is when we love on our brothers and love on our sisters and help our brothers and help our sisters you are in the word and god is using you because the bible says they will know you that you are my disciples by the love that you have one for another. but we fail to see those light those things that people think is not you know people like to to blow their horns oh brother so and so did this for me and he laid his hand and i got healed no no no no no no no you know what heals you your faith and you know what that faith in itself give is a gift from god look it up that's what brother brahma said he said your faith god gives you the gift of faith because that man can pray for you all day until god gives you the gift of faith ain't nothing happening that's right hallelujah i like that you know so you look at this thing he says how be it this is the part i like because we're coming we're coming and how we know we're in truth because god said it would be this way that's right amen how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth i got this from uh sister angela yesterday she said he's a god i'm like yes he's a god he's a guy he's not gonna make you do nothing he's gonna lead you he's a shepherd he's not going to force himself on you you're going to either do it or you won't whosoever will that was good guide you into all truth guides you god will place truth in front of you you must still make the choosing you must you must choose for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and be he will show you things to come can i read the amplified version is this all right but when he the spirit of truth the truth giving spirit comes he will guide you into all truth the whole full truth for he will not speak of his own message on his own authority but he will tell whatever he hears from the father he will give the message that has been given to him and he will announce and declare to you the things that are to come amen that will happen in the future amen and you can slide malachi 4 right in there you understand me because he said he not they so he prophesied jesus is telling there's coming one like like moses said there's coming one like me and jesus said there's coming one like me and he'll be the son of man a son of man revealing the son of man and he's going to speak my word we needed it look at all the confusion we're babylon all over again everybody's right in their own eyes but god said there shall be light in the evening time hallelujah it didn't stop i'm living from glory to glory is that right hallelujah all the way from ephesus up into the bride age or the bride dispensation however you want to say it but i know one thing i'm living in eternity hallelujah you say well what do you mean well i'm gonna tell you something truth it's truth but certain truths cannot be applied to our day it was truth when god told noah build an ark for the saving of your house that was applicable for that time but building a nod can't save you because god has moved on it was true when god said put the blood on the doorposts and the little try it now there they'll lock you up for slaying an animal it was true and by that truth because they obeyed that truth amen they walked free hallelujah think about it the pharisees and the sadducees in their time believed that they were saved and and that they were going to heaven they they were perfect on the law they they jotted every ah eye and crossed every teeth their works were great so much so paul said i was blameless in the things in which i was taught i kept it all it wasn't just paul the rich young ruler was tested himself by jesus and just went down the line amen with him because he asked a question by law he says lord what must i do and because he approached that was his protocol he asked god what must i do in reference to the law to keep it and jesus went down the line see you've got to be careful how you ask god questions hallelujah and so what did god what did he do he went all the way down and he said oh but you good you good there check check check check but he saw one thing he loved his money he loved his riches right and the probably god said god called him the minister and he switched that he he he had rather be rich than to preach the gospel let me tell you something there there is nothing that can measure the wealth that god will give you when you become a christian you say my brother books you don't look rich i am you may not see it but my day coming [Laughter] and the gold and everything that i obtained by jesus christ will never be kinked amen i'm richer than you can imagine but let me go ahead on he even you know but the rich young ruler couldn't give it up you see that's what's wrong with people you approach god by the law he's going to respond to you by the law you understand me but look zacchaeus even though he was a rich man he saw himself so unworthy and he tried to hide up in the sycamore tree and jesus passing by knew the heart of zacchaeus said come on down out of that tree this day i'm going to have dinner with you i'm going to stop at your house but look at zacchaeus he never asked the question but because of his heart being right he was inspired he began to confess he began to say what he had and he began to tell god i'm going to give this instead of this i'm going to give this instead of this you see what i'm saying that's what the living god will do that's what inspiration will do what happened if you can't read or write you need the inspiration of god you need god you need the life hallelujah glory to god you see how be it when the spirit of truth has come and the spirit of truth has come and that's what the world is missing you say well what do you mean brother brooks don't you understand the majority of people always miss it in the days of noah the majority missed it in the days of of moses majority missed it you say oh no no no millions came out yeah but they still was blind they never understood who moses was hallelujah he looked like a man but he was god in the man y'all understand me that's why they miss william branham amen it had been even prophesied that many would look on him as he was god he wasn't yet he was you're not yet you are amen see it's god in you the man never declared himself to be god people did that they're caught everywhere and their message calls the reality of it is true there's baptist cause methodist cults every everybody got look up the definition and you'll find it right but there are those who are free you understand me they understand who their husband is they understand who their lord is they understand and they'll never be entangled in bondage to a man they have christ the same anointing that malachi 4 had they had it a double portion is given to the bride y'all understand me don't get me wrong let me break it down so you can understand what i'm saying i i say break it down i mean like that let me just say it this way when moses was on the scene everybody wanted to see moses moses do this moses do that and he did when trouble came called on moses but when moses passed on now moses never died like that he died but he was resurrected right but moses told joshua whatever you do remember everything moses said you see what i'm saying so joshua's commission could not go out well without moses foundation y'all understand me but what did joshua do that moses didn't do when they got over joshua began to make the church work he took all the emphasis off himself and says no you go spy out the lady you understand you go this you go that because you need some experiences you need the supernatural experience i've got it you need it and that's the way the pride is right now you need it the move is on for the bride you need it hallelujah is pie out the land conquer the inhabitants that's what we've been ordained to do but listen don't be like a can i gotta have a little bit of the world you know what i mean don't be like akin you get in trouble like that not only did he can bring himself to judgment but his whole family his dog his cows his cats whatever he had was judged and killed i'm almost done i'm not going to be long tonight but i want you to turn with me to first king please let's look in the mirror of the word because we need to see ourselves where are you there are characters in this bible that will identify who you are yeah you okay all of us must understand amen by god's grace that this thing is a beautiful thing if you let it don't give up on god because god won't give up on you but you know a lot of times we want to give up on god why you're holding the life raft hold on to it you don't give you don't let go of that you see the waves dashing and everything else oh well no no i see the shore i see safety as long as i see safety i'm going to hold on to it you love the lord in reality we're not holding on to it he's holding on to us thank god i don't have to worry about his hand getting weak right first king you there i'll bring something out and you most of y'all know it first king let's uh read at the ninth verse 17 9. i think i'm in the right place am i at the right place 17-9 up and wrote something down wrong just bear with me for a moment must be 19. i'm actually jumping my my mess but let's go there let's go there first king let's start at the uh we could read the ninth verse but i want to read the 24th verse 24th verse the last verse of that particular scripture and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth and the elijah of that day that anointing came on the prophet of this day y'all understand me why are you preaching this brother books because if you stray away from the books if you stray away from the tape if you stray away from the urim of theorem somewhere satan gonna slip a lie on you yes sir amen and he is the father of lies do you think god is stupid do you think god will allow this generation to go the way it is without leaving himself a witness god will never leave himself without a witness he told this wicked generation that even the queen of sheba is going to rise up in judgment against you why because she she was willing to lose everything for the truth and when she saw solomon the prophet of god in his on his own display he said oh my goodness the half has not yet been told y'all understand me do you really believe that god will let the gentile age go in come in and out without sinning a prophet with everybody out there all it's doing is bringing more confusion but i'm gonna tell you something god has never left himself somebody got to be speaking the truth and everything that they speak should be able to be found in the word of god amen hallelujah now i'm saying this too because you ought to understand that brother branham was actually ordained to clothe the bride with the word you understand me we saw what what what all the other ones are doing we see how they've corrupted themselves but the bride of jesus christ she's clothed with a pure word now you say what brother bruce well listen i'ma tell you something it's god's provided way i've had nothing to do with it god chose noah could have been another of somebody else but that was god's providing way god chose moses could have been yeah and moses was a murderer but god chose him that was his way god chose paul who was saul a murderer too he cheered when they stole stephen but he was the great man of god and a lot of people don't even know to this day he was the angel of that age paul wrote more books than any of them and then he had a statement said if you don't believe what i believe if you don't preach what i've written if you don't believe that you're going to be cursed amen well i don't believe paul well you don't have to [Laughter] i just say the word shall not fall away the bible says the grass withers and the flowers fade away but the word of the lord shall stand amen people say well i just you know i don't understand what people think the word is but anyway let's move on by god's grace you love the lord you love the lord amen listen you know uh uh uh 17 uh first king i don't know how i've got that 17 24 let's see 17 24. yeah i just read that but somehow somehow i must be the first verse i wrote something down wrong but let me let me read it it's in there we'll come back to correcting it you can find it for me oh mercy okay let's move on you know why i'm wrong because it's the wrong chapter 16 of judges i'm sorry i got you hallelujah thank god for the flesh the flesh will let you down every time it will embarrass you but thank god for his grace amen judges 16. i wa i'm working with trees now i'm actually working with the image that you're seeing in the mirror what are you seeing okay because i want you to know you could be ordained of god called by god elected by god but reflecting the wrong stuff the first verse says then went samson to gazer and saw there and harlot and went in unto her y'all understand me this is the nazirite this is the one that god ordained to destroy the philistines and in his weak moment he finds a harlot and he lays with her i'mma show you something here because at that point in time you think well the lord should have departed but you understand he had a covenant he had a nazarite vow so god couldn't leave him you understand me that's the only reason why god don't leave you you have a promise you have a vow but look what he's doing look at the next verse look at the next verse and it was told the the the gazites saying samson is coming hither and they com com they compassed him in and laid and wait for him all night in the gate of the city and we're quiet all night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him and samson laid till midnight and rose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon the shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before hebron he possessed the gates of his enemy even right after he had done evil y'all understand me because god made a covenant oh god y'all understand me there are many people who do evil but god stay with them and at the end of the day they shall possess the gates of their enemy hallelujah we all falter we all fall but god has ordained us to be a nazarite unto the lord and in his doing not ours and as long as we stay with this message of the seven seals and you know we we stay with that don't cut the locks stay with it god will honor you god will prove you on who you are don't worry god is there if you can see yourself in the scripture because the prophet preached a message once more and that was after 63 who was he talking to the pride of jesus christ he had already been kicked out of the church nobody wanted anything to do with him but they thought they were kicking him out but what he was doing was fulfilling revelations the third chapter where jesus was standing at the door trying to get in to that very age amen he ain't there who is that impersonator amen let me tell you something living saved is living right samson did that thing but at the end of the day samson had to die with his enemy you understand me you might do your wrong and god will be with you until he brings you to that place you're going to have to die with your enemy you're going to have to die to yourself you're going to have to die to your ways you're going to have to die to all of that but even in that you gain the victory everybody knows about samson everybody knows everybody knows he fell and trapped entrapped with delilah and delilah typed out the world and that's what happened to christians sometimes they've fallen trapped to the world but nothing can stop god's election nothing can stop the predestinated seed no matter what you go through god will bring you out you just trust him you might have to go through a rough time but god will be there with you did y'all catch it the same tree because he's a tree you're a tree yeah you bear fruit you're a tree the woman is the fruit tree and at the end of the day that's what the psalmist says i'll be like a tree planted by the river water i shall not be y'all understand me so we we must understand israel is a tree she's a fruit tree she's a fig tree you understand me you're a tree oh i can tell you some things but anyway at the end of the day amen god will see his seed not only prolonged but declared there'll be a lot of people in heaven you thought wasn't going to make it look at it look what samson did in just the second verse he's taking up the gates of gaza and then the prophet god preached a message possessing the gates of your enemy what was he saying you and i are living in an adulterous generation you know what that means everybody is it's the truth everybody is it takes 400 years to clean your blood and that means no mistakes in between so if you're not you won by birth you understand me that's why we need a new birth yo y'all don't let me tell y'all something gentiles are dogs and every gentile think that their blood so clean your blood ain't clean not one man blood is clean the only clean blood is the blood of christ yeah i think about that at times i said you know what people try to law and law this and law that and law this and all that and all they're doing is putting themselves and making themselves two-fold child of hell the only way you'll make it to heaven is to trust in the sacrificial lamb of god amen and all that he's done for you that's it and by you trusting in him he will make it happen for you let me hurry up listen a very thought you know i could say oh i'm going to go to go to school and i'm going to be a doctor a medical doctor now that's a real joke it is because it ain't there people say well you can be whatever you want to be that's a lie too you know because you got to understand that the gifts and callings of god is without repentance whatever god has given you you was born with it if you're gonna be a musician you had to have music in you somebody pulled it out of you but it was already there is that right a fig tree the the fruit's already in there it just takes seasonal changes to bring it out oh people say oh man i wish i could sing and y'all know there's a lot of people wish they could sing and you know what it doesn't matter inspiration doesn't change it they can be anointed but nothing is going to deceive that ear right it is what it is but to them they sound beautiful y'all know what i'm saying i mean it's this it is what it is people make comedy out of those kind of things but the truth of the matter is and a gift whatever gift it is it's in you already huh you didn't have to repent to get it right brother bannon was a prophet before he was born when he was born you understand me you were bribed before you were born you can't wish to be bright you you can't work to be bright there's nothing you can do those those things were elected and chosen let me put it it's just the word of god said jesus christ according to revelation is the beginning of god's creation and sometimes people think well god created god no that's not what he's saying he's saying jesus christ was the author of the creation the logos came out of him because god cannot be seen but god built him a house called logos and he stepped into it came out and began to create in oh he condescend what do you mean god is he was everywhere everything and he can't dis dimension no dimensional because god is here right now but he's in another dimension you can't see because you're trapped in this dimension hallelujah but one day we'll be free from this dimension and we'll see him just as he is you say i don't believe that brother it's true can y'all see those radio waves going through the you can't see the television vision coming through here they are that's in another dimension we call that the fourth dimension and science developed a crystal that could catch that place it in a box so you can see it real people real time real happenings hallelujah y'all understand me it's proof there's another dimension and if that dimension exists the dimension of the loss does too and if the dimension of the laws exists the dimension of heaven does too you understand me it's there whether you like it or not let me move on about god's grace i'm almost done i had to say all those things you say even your believing this message is a gift everybody can't believe it everybody can't see it everybody can't receive it it's a gift from god don't ever take it lightly amen that's true you understand me don't ever take it lightly i wish the brain the brain can't just do what it wants to do you know what i mean there was a time i thought the same thing oh you can be whatever you want to be i did i thought that for a long time and i recently found out that's not true yeah how you're going to tell a man who who can't sing you can be a top-notch singer all you got to do is practice practice and go practice ain't going to help that because you got to understand singing is a revelation it's something revealed you don't even know how you do it but you do it there's no science about it they can try to produce it but there's a lot of people with good vocal cords and they still can't hold a tune let me move on so inspiration is always good you know you see inspiration all of us have inspiration and time but all inspiration is not right everything that comes to you by way of inspiration needs to be checked by the word of god there are so many people say well i know i i know what god did for me i had a brother that really just broke my heart i went through the scriptures showed him all of the things about baptism and everything else he saw it he literally cried he went back home they changed his mind he came back and he said i'm not gonna do it and i was just so broken because under the inspiration he was able to see it but once the inspiration left he chose not to believe it so when you come to a truth and you choose not to believe it then you become blind it's like what ephesus what the the all of the ages did you know when the you know methodists and the pentecostals went on beyond that and those who closed their eyes to that they were left behind and so is it with the word of god now once god you're walking he is the shepherd he's the god remember i told you he's guide you and lead you into all truth and let me tell you like this god people always look insane they never make sense can you imagine how crazy moses noah looked it's gonna rain ain't no water no clouds no nothing it's gonna rain what is it anyway [Laughter] what is rain they didn't know what rain was because during that time it never rained do came up from the ground read your bible and then we said oh water coming down from heaven they looked up in the blue skies but they didn't know in the laboratory of man he was trying to figure things out just like he's doing today see it wasn't god who destroyed it it was man science in their laboratory don't cheat what folks are oh these people weren't cavemen they didn't have no clubs coming out of a they were far more intelligent than we are we're just coming in my day and time we just come up with what they call pie and you go to egypt and you find out that that's how they built those kind of stones with mathematically they were using pie and all that other stuff they were using i don't know whether they call it the same thing as we call it but the point is we could they were mathematical geniuses they were able to build that pyramid amen in the center of the earth the sin of this and the sin of that and it all came equal to the sun and noah was far better a boat builder than the titanic man and nora didn't have half the equipment he had you understand me the difference between noah's boat the ark and the titanic is that god built the ark he used noah to do it but it was all blueprinted by god you see what i'm saying that's why people are a rapture and i'm i'm closing i'm trying to stop a rapture look in the mirror folks who are you you you say your bride you should be dressed like one you should adorn yourself like one you should carry yourself like one right you should stay clear you should stay as clean as possible because though we know when we mess up we got a bleach you know but what i'm trying to say is we're different from all the others not that we're trying to be he chose us to be we're not a vastly we're an esther we come from nowhere with no name but yet and still god has given us a name and you and i must always look in this bible and say where am i lord where am i let me look into this word revelations 19 7 says let be glad and rejoice and get honored to for for the beverage of the lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready made herself ready and you know the problem is with when you say made it make you think that you've got a labor you know what you labor to do die to your will move your will out of the way and let his will be done that's what jesus said lord not my will but thine will be done when you move your will god can place his will in you coming from the message presented present stage of my ministry he brother said i hope he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress the bride in the clothes of the word and for his righteousness i hope he will crown me let me stand on that day and say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world hmm this ain't no you're not reading some story book are you not reading some little books that this uh seventh grade education man that's why god did it that way people so smart and that's exactly what happened in the days of john god god stays john like a wild man think about it elijah coming out the wilderness hair all bushy and not comb breath you know and everything else popping p locus in his mouth like peanuts they thought he was crazy and he's screaming and hollering and calling them names oh and yet god was hiding behind that veil then he took jesus his son and it made it took jesus born in bethlehem he took him down to egypt from egypt to nazareth and nazareth was one of the wickedest city ever and that name stuck with him jesus of nazareth why it was god cloaking himself putting a bad name on him so that those who could see him won't see him because of the natural but would be able to see him because of the did supernatural same thing to william branham mama half breed right dad is a drunk didn't have no education y'all understand but he had the pillow fire you understand me you know the point is that god looks at you and he took you out from every one of us that came from some part of life disgusting all of us wasn't raised up in the church some of us some of us have bad lives don't you they were so bad you can't even do nothing on testimony at that time you can't tell at all try to tell it all you be in trouble all them carnal christians be in there you understand me but he took us think y'all i tell you what we can't see it quite yet but i tell you what it's going to take jesus to wipe the tears from your eyes because otherwise they will never stop it's going to take him to stop it because we're going to have joy we're going to miss our loved ones we're going to things people who won't make we're going to and then all of a sudden he comes and the prophet god said when he wiped the tears away from your eyes you won't even remember those who who who you left behind because heaven won't be heaven if you could think about those lost relatives that didn't make it you're gonna wipe all that away from your memory and all you will remember is the good part you love the lord constantly stay in the mirror look this is examining times we won't we're not going to be purged we're being purged by the word now foolish virgins will be purged but the bride of jesus christ she's washing herself by the water of the word right now and we've got more than enough more than enough you love god let us stand god knows i hope everybody's been blessed amen i i try to preach in love and i trust that you feel what i feel because you know this is a time of urgency and things are getting more critical all over the world your freedom has been taken from you and you don't even know it yet and things are not going to get better things are going to get worse and you got to be prepared y'all understand me love your enemies y'all got enough love to love your enemy y'all better know it you gotta love you [Laughter] you know because they coming your way you know a lot of christians i'm telling you i don't know how we're going to do it i just know that if it started off well peter tried to defend himself and got in trouble same thing at the end you better know you better have some of that anointing [Music] real anointing the kind that when they walk close to you they'll feel it and fear will strike you understand me you gotta have that that kind of anointing that will it's like like the scripture says a wall of fire built around that's the kind of anointing we need and people of god that's the kind god wants to give you we are coming into the very image and likeness of jesus christ y'all understand what that means that's beyond anything we can comprehend but god says i'm taking you there follow me i'll take you there and i believe with all of my heart right now we're all struggling we know what's right we want to do right and yet we have these little things that seem to hold but understand god the lord jesus christ he breaks everything he destroys all the works of the enemy it's already done but we need to learn how to accept what has been done i know with all my heart that things are happening and everybody you know we have our own problems your problem's different from mine mine is different from yours but i do understand what my problems are doing for me they're making me better they're molding me into the image and likeness of christ they're shaping me so that when i look in the word okay lord i can see i didn't do that but you did it you did that for me and you know how many y'all know this truth you you've had people scream and yell or do something to you it could be anything and you couldn't even respond god kept you and you know in the devil and the devil is on the left side of you said if they just should have known me just a few years ago if they would have known me then see but that's the devil talking to you because we have come to be new creatures not some patched up job not some you know thread tying us to the old man everything has been savored everything has been cut we've been free and the bible said he he whom the son is set free is free indeed and that's why i keep saying look in here the prophet of god brought us an image of jesus christ by the word of god and we must learn to see that image and walk in it focus on it until that image we become that very image he didn't eat an air from the word but he brought us an image when the whole church world and lost the image he ate the you know what put your picture on the wall there's no power in it there's only power in the word of god and you and i must understand that that image that he's brought to us amen we must keep it we must keep it because that's what we must become you understand me it's real and it's late it is as it is right now we got people who everywhere and i trust it's none of us we claim to be christian but we're still acting like samson huh you got to make the tree good or you got to make it evil that's the time we're living in the tree must be good if it's not good it's going to be tuned down you're going to be left behind and the only way that you can ever make the tree good is that you must be born again the life of christ must come into you in order to make you good because there is only one good and that's god you love the lord god is good to us anybody desire prayer oh me in moments like this [Applause] i lived love you lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] song to jesus [Music] see [Music] oh [Music] god [Music]
