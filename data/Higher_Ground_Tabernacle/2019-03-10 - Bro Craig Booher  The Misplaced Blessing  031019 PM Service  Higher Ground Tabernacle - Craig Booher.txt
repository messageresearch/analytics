threw me off last time i was here you had the pulpit facing this way and so this is good this is this works it works out really good it's good to see you all i see some growing in our midst and friends and loved ones we appreciate you we're still here and we intend to keep fighting till jesus come and it'll be a fight and so we're just real happy to be with you we've been traveling uh full blast just trying to do something for the lord you know but we're really happy to be with you here tonight and appreciate brother brooks having us you know you're all home away from home and i just feel like i'm among friends and loved ones and we appreciate you very much so let's let's turn our attention to the scriptures if we can turn in the bible we had a wonderful service this morning and uh they didn't leave me a whole lot of voice left but they gave a peace offering they drove me here so i'm just uh really happy to be here with you more than words can say and i'm going to do my best here i just you know as you try to find the mind of the lord and i just feel i feel to tackle the scripture and so let's just uh approach it together in matthew chapter 11 and uh we'll start with verse one and i can use as much as you can give me uh monitors and amends so matthew chapter 11 and i ask that you just pay very close attention just if you will just don't let your your mind divert stay right with the thought and i think you'll see uh if you pay close attention we'll walk right down into it i think you'll see it clearly matthew chapter 11 verse 1 and it came to pass when jesus made an end of commanding his 12 disciples he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities and when john had heard in prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and he said unto him art thou he that should come or shall we look for another and jesus answered and said unto them go and show john again those things which you hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me i want to preach tonight on uh the misplaced blessing blessed is he that is not offended in me if we could just pray heavenly father we love you with all of our hearts and god we're christians we're not ashamed of that but we could not do it without you and so lord when we come into the house of god we don't stand in our own strength but we're dependent upon you we ask that you empower us tonight lift us up lord into your presence speak to us things that will establish us strengthen us settle us in the precious faith of jesus christ we love you we commit ourselves to you now in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you can have your seeds john the baptist was trained for thank you brother rich was trained for 30 years just for six months work that's astounding to me that that god would just the greatest man born of a woman outside of jesus christ that god would invest so much into him just for six months work and that's all god needed but he fulfilled god's purpose and you know god's ways are not our ways we often think you know that we could maybe do a great work for god and it's totally contrary to what god would want from us at all and none of us would know that he was the greatest man born of a woman except jesus told us we would never know the way god views things are very different than the way we understand it and then god would train jesus christ himself 30 years just for three years work and so it's all about quality not quantity it's all about quality say lord make me a quality christian that's all i want to be i don't want to be anything great but i want to be a real christian and you know john the baptist daddy died when he was 9 years old that's what the prophet of god tells us and that that god began training john out in the wilderness he said his job was to introduce the messiah and he said his job was too great to be trained in the schools like his daddy he said but god had to have him one-on-one and that's where the prophets are trained on the backsides of the desert on the potter's wheel where god can mold uncompromising spirit god can mold uh eagle eyes and and understanding of god you can't get that in a school it only comes by the spirit and bill branham said that his job was too important to go to school but his job he said he had to be formed of god and god began to train him to watch for a sign six months work his job was short but very important and he had to be positive and brother venom said so do we got to be positive i believe in knowing what we believe it's not good enough that the pastor knows that her your daddy knows it but we got to know whom we have believed if you're the last one standing you've got to be positive so you can stand in the face of the devil yourself and say i know whom i have believed and i know what this message is and then when the shaking comes and it will come you'll be able to stand on your own testimony how many can say give me strength lord make me positive we must be positive and john had to be positive he had to know because there was going to be trials coming up his way he was to introduce the messiah it was a big job and there was no doubt many false prophets uh competing with jesus that they were the real one so the entire ministry of john the baptist was contained in two scriptures in isaiah and in malachi but yet he was the greatest and when he stomped out and came to his public ministry he shook the whole region like an earthquake like a spiritual earthquake he just began to shake the whole place john was preparing the way in other words something was coming behind him let me tell you there is something coming behind this message god that his wife has prepared herself and made herself ready john was preaching repentance and proclaiming uh that the messiah was coming and john was the messenger of the covenant he was standing between dispensations and he was introducing a new lamb and a new age and a new covenant it was all together new they were entering into a new frontier reminds me of what the lord told joshua you've not gone this way before there's something about god there's always something new let's not settle for yesterday but let's look for something new when i say that god ain't sending another message but it's just a fresh experience of the message that he has given us john was the great eagle he flew down right onto the banks of the jordan and he put his wings out and then he began to introduce the messiah i love the way god does things he's in he's in just skins don't look like nothing probably spit more than i did might even missed a tooth or something popping locusts and wild honey tell him to repent or perish you can imagine what an offense that was to a trained theologian that this man popping locust is telling me i'm a snake in the grass and he's telling him get to going serpents in there i mean they were moving in all directions stomping and snakes are flying laying the axe to the root of the tree i like the way god does it he had molded an uncompromising spirit and i believe that god is sent a message to make us uncompromising in the word as well he didn't pull any punches he just brother venom said he let the chips fall where they were and he said he just preached it raw with no gloves he just preached it spoke it out and i like that brother branham said one day he preached to one that got very offended bear with me stay with me with my thought and he said that that a fellow comma said now uh what was it was it herod that was out in the audience with his brother's wife and he said now listen don't say anything we've got the governor in the audience today and he said john actually ran out and stuck his finger right in his face and said it ain't lawful for you to have her and that got him in trouble brother branham said god give us men like that we ain't looking for our own kingdom but we're looking for the kingdom of god john was cast into into a damp jail this is where i want to start building brother branham said it must have been a horrible experience for a man that was accustomed to being free for a man that god is comfort from god out in the wilderness would feel the sun shine upon his face and feel the presence of god out there for them to put him in a damp dungeon where it's cold and he said just getting moldy bread and and he said he was losing weight there was no bible to read and he said for his comfort and he said it was there in those days and those days turned to weeks or those weeks might have turned to months his eagle eye began to film over brother branham said john the baptist had a nervous breakdown and then he become confused this is very odd this the scripture that john was sending someone to jesus to say are you him or do we look for another after he already identified him as the lamb of god how did that happen he knew the sign he was trained by god to see the sign and brother branham said john listen closely john was prophesying as he was anointed by the power of the holy spirit and he said the messiah is coming his fan is in his hand he'll thoroughly purge his floor and he said the spirit of god was just prophesying out of john and he said but when jesus came he was not a conqueror he was meek he was lowly he was pushed around i wanted to read this to you he said john became offended john became offended because things did not go the way that john thought it should go i'm quoting now brother branham said because he had introduced jesus the messiah whose fan was in his hand that would purge the floor he couldn't hardly understand he was let down and he was offended see the sign was unmistakable he said when you see the spirit of god like a dove brother branham said like a pillar of fire coming down on him he said and remaining that is the messiah he was trained to see it but brother branham said his eagle eye filmed over down in those conditions and he said john thought his fan was listen he thought his plan was in his hand that the millennium millennium would start right then that the grain was already ready and that he was gathering his wheat into the garner but that was not that coming he was seeing the second coming and when it did not look like he thought it should he became offended he was prophesying of the grain he was prophesying of this day brother branham says it direct quote modern events made clear by prophecy he said the grain is here the bride he said he'll burn it with unquenchable fire the stalk he said seek salvation while you can he said because the life is in the grain cast away the theology the life is in the grain this is the gathering time the combine time and john this is what john was looking for right now so john his eagle eyes film over and he sends his disciples and said are you here we sh should we look for another and jesus jesus said just wait till this evening tell me what you see go tell john what you see just wait to the meeting and so as they were watching they were studying very closely and they were seeing the eyes of the blind open they were seeing the lame leap like a heart they were seeing the power of god on display that they had not seen in that in that time of dispensation and then brother branham says this i imagine those disciples of john was watching every move of course john had taught them what the messiah was and they began to see what was taken place and then after the service those two disciples went back to john that the blind see the lame walk and told them all about the meeting and the poor's got the gospel preached to him you tell john don't be scared don't think anything different i'm right on schedule everything is running right i'm right on schedule don't pay attention to anything else blessed is he that is not offended in me don't be offended john he misplaced the beatitude no matter what takes place stay with the message stay with the word i know it don't look right but don't be offended john turn with me if you will to matthew chapter 5 verse 2. matthew chapter 5 verse 2 and we'll read down through verse 12. everybody love the lord and he opened his mouth and he taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you persecute you say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you now go to chapter 11 verse 6. and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me brother branham calls this the forgotten beatitude or the misplaced blessing and he placed this in a very particular place that word offend blessed is he that is not offended in me means stumbled blessed is he that has not stumbled or caused to fall away who you love the lord and so brother branham said he never condemned him jesus never condemned him he had the spirit of elijah he knew he did he knowed everything was running right everything was according to the schedule john introduced him god presented him and so will it be at the end time everything is on schedule don't be offended believe on him churches are offended people are offended but don't be offended he's right on schedule don't be scared are you ready don't be offended in god's way the way that he fulfills his word don't be offended when god the way he brings his word to pass don't be offended by the way god answers your prayers are you with me don't be offended at god because that attitude will take you off course and your ego eyes will film over but keep your heart centered on god's word no matter the way you interpret it lord how believe it don't ever be offended at god's word don't lean to your own understanding bible tells us in revelations i know thy tribulations and thy poverty i know and brother branham said isn't this amazing that god would know that god knows about it and he said but does he stem the tribulation no he said does he does he says i know it i'm not unmindful what a stumbling block this is to many people see many think that love means no suffering they thought that love meant baby parental care that that was god's love but god's love is elective love the proof of his election no matter what happens is his love is proven by the fact that he chose us to salvation and because god chose you to salvation and sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as paul he may commit you to suffering like job that's god's prerogative but it's all with a purpose and we are not immune from troubles because we are believers does not mean we are immune from troubles you think oh christian everything runs perfect no it doesn't no actually it we have more troubles as christians but you know brother branham said god promises god promised many afflictions strange feelings strange things beyond our understanding but it's always done for the good you trust him he said just can't understand it because if we did it wouldn't be faith he said but we do it we have it we believe it by faith god's word it's going to work for the good none of us are immune from those things we realize that but it's for our good and the trial of our our faith is more precious than gold job job said when he hath tried me i will come forth as gold we hate the trying but i want you to think about the shining you know it's just like the man that challenged brother branham brother branham was talking about the first the early church fathers in the book of acts they sold all that they had and laid it at the apostles feet and he said worst mistake this was a prosperity preacher worst mistake that they ever could have done he said they had no homes to go to brother branham said the holy spirit did not make a mistake he said they were in a perfect position to spread the gospel all over the world he said god don't make a mistake see but listen god knows what he's doing but many get offended in god's way because god's way will never add up like we think it should add up and many of us judge god because it don't add up to our peanut brain thinking can you imagine you know i was telling the the church this morning in iowa city i said john the you know john when he or paul rather you know paul was establishing churches and the devil was a matter of hornet and so you know he said i'm going to throw i'm going to throw paul into prison you think here's a man a light to the gentiles yeah i mean he was faithful whipped and stoned and rejected but you know when they threw him in there all he did was write the new testament aren't you glad that paul was thrown in prison we still get comfort out of those scriptures same with john they bowled him in oil as a witch they thought he had a devil they couldn't boil him god preserved him put him on patmos why god had to get him alone he was traveling too much testifying too much i've got a message for an end-time people you think this is why am i an alcatraz i'm in snakes and lizards and i hate snakes this is a place where i can get you quiet nobody's going to bother you nobody's going to bother you me and you john john out there them snakes crying he didn't notice the snakes when the presence of god came down and he broke into a vision and began to write god help us not to notice our trials but keep our eyes upon the goal hallelujah do you love the lord but don't be offended in the way that god brings it to pass god don't know us anything we know that all things say all things all things work for the good to them that love god and are called according to his purpose he works in mysterious ways many times he gives us a lash of correction and we wonder how could it be working for the good but after it's all over we praise god and we know that it did work for the good he said just be obedient to the word be obedient to the chastening he never would chasten us unless we needed it maybe we are not he said but we know it will all work out for the good just lay your life in his hands and say here i am lord just use me guide me direct me i want to be pleasing to thee and don't murmur no matter what path stay with it anyhow and god will work it out for the good because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord blessed is he that is not offended in me lord i don't want to be offended when trials come my way i don't want to be offended when i'm rejected and misunderstood i don't want to be offended i believe that all things say all things all things work for the good to them that love him just make sure you love him many people hate him in the trial because they're offended i'm not going to be offended i'm going to love him in my trials then it'll work for my good i mean say lord change my attitude god permits trials to come he brings tension into the church i know brother brooks hated to hear that one he brings tensions into the church for every son must be tried and proven and tested he lets sickness strike you he lets diseases come on you he tests you to show the world that you are a seat of abraham he permits disasters he permits his friends to turn against you he permits the devil to turn loose and tempt you but not take your life he can throw you on a bed of affliction he can turn your neighbors again so he can turn your church against you he can do almost anything and it's god's will for him to do it and it's more precious than gold glory our trials are more precious than gold brother branham said your trials are jewels more precious than gold when you go through a temptation hold your ground stay right where you are till god says it don't shake it every wind stay right there and even if you're a little out of the way if your heart is really sincere stand firm and god will respect it ain't that wonderful god is only testing an action and a reaction god wants to see faith is not offended brother branham said there was a boy that a catholic boy was praying for his mama she was sick and he said lord heal my mom and he was reading that prayer book well when she died he grabbed the prayer book and threw it in the fire brother branham said his attitude was wrong to begin with he should never ask to change god's mind but ask god change my mind to fit your will you know brother branham told the story of a of a shepherd he was walking in the east and he had a little lamb beautiful little lamb with a little broken leg and they oh it's a beautiful little lamb he said yes it is and they said uh it must have broke its leg out in the wilderness he said no he said i broke it they said what a cruel shepherd you are he said no you don't understand he said he kept wandering away from me but i wanted to show him a little love i wanted to bond with him i wanted to show him how much i cared i broke his leg so i pack him around everywhere i go he can never be away from me but he's right with me he's right with me in prayer he's right with me in service he's right with me every step of the way god knows how to get our attention it's a fact that that the church flourishes under pressure the pressure must be but blessed are they that are not offended in me don't doubt him believe it's working for your good we got trials don't murmur don't be negative you believe god i know i'm a child of the king i know this is working for my good use the little faith that you got and speak a positive profession and you watched god begin to move did you know brother branham said many of people die a premature death because they don't accept their healing their attitude towards the atonement they die early and it was available it's all about our attitude you know job was the greatest man of the east he was a perfect man one that feared god and shoot evil his children were getting worldly brother branham said it in that in those terms so they had a bunch of children they were getting worldly and job was offering burnt offerings for his family continually and brother branham said the burnt offering was offered before the tragedy he said let's not try to offer burnt offerings in the tragedy he said but he was doing it before getting ready for trials to set in and god permitted satan to afflict him and the devil said can i turn loose on him he said the only reason he loves you is you baby you give him everything that he wants you hedge him in you bless his cattle you bless his barns you bless his family so sick of this round here give him to me and he'll curse at your face he won't amend you in church he'll go to the back nothing wrong with anyone in the back he won't give you an amen he'll hate your guts god said can't do it you can't do it you can't make isaiah brooks curse me you can't make the stranger curse me you can't make them turn their back on me don't you touch his life you turn him loose and you see what kind of faith is burning in their heart here come the test he lost his cattle he lost his asses he lost his children it boils head to foot he must have looked like a monster a miserable sight his wife said cursed god and dying his comforters come and said their sin in your life brother branham said you've got the wrong theology your doctrine is wrong or you wouldn't be going through this whoo that's what brother branham said is his comforters the devil was doing everything he could i want you to hear this quote i built i i built the story of job for this purpose brother branham said he lost everything his children and he said he was being accused of being a secret sinner he knew that he met god's requirements he knew there's no need of satan tempting him he knew it was the devil as long as the devil could make him believe that his sickness was god doing it he was whipped wow if he could convince job this was between the devil and job if he could get job to become offended if he could get job to believe this ain't the devil doing it it's god doing it he'd lost the battle he lost his position in christ he was the only going through the trials to make him something it wasn't god doing it it was satan doing it and he'll try to tell you those trials is god putting putting punishment on you and it's god permitting it to temper you to see if you're tied to the earth with earthly cares and earthly treasures to see where your treasure is and job was a prophet and brother branham revealed how job stood against so much temptation brother branham said the secret was his burnt sacrifice i don't understand this i don't know why but i have come god's provided way and i'm standing on the blood my confidence is in my sacrifice my confidence is in the word of god he was justified he overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of his testimony and it worked out for the good because you and i what would the world be without job how many times you've been in trials and drew from his experience and so this horrible affliction upon job was for our good it was for the good of the church it was for the good of the kingdom can you say amen see god sees further down the road than we see we only see here god sees what he's trying to make you he also knows where we would lead ourselves if he didn't intervene many times we think god is angry with us and he's only trying to get fruit blessed is he that is not offended in me just for a moment because you say how does that relate to me i'll tell you exactly how it relates to you you know brother branham said that day at calvary if you get a chance to go back and listen to that message that day at calvary he said he broke satan's backbone he said sin was destroyed that day at calvary he said his last breath was it is finished listen to me closely at that moment everything that adam lost was restored by jesus christ that day at calvary the sin question was settled forever that day at calvary every redemptive blessing that you'll ever receive happened that day at calvary every human being that will ever be saved was saved that day at calvary if you reject it then you will die in your sins but you were healed at calvary you were forgiven at calvary your sins are already forgiven but you must accept it all sinners everything happened at calvary every one of us was saved at calvary now if you do not accept it then you must appear before god as a sinner and be judged calvary included you calvary included me brother madam says this 1964 after the seals every sinner right now is already saved everyone on earth is already saved right now he forgave them at calvary but if they go out not accepting it then they will die a sinner see every sinner is saved right this moment god so loved the world are you ready that is seed and non-seed i know it's shocking that is seed and non-seed every man on earth was saved at calvary remember when he came to cain i was just sharing this with a brother last night when when he came to claim he said if you do what your brother does what do you say i will receive you god was not just talking god would have received him now when abel died his blood cried out against cain his righteousness condemned cain but brother branham said the blood of jesus christ speaketh better things than that of abel and then i'll just read it to you the token he said abel was a righteous man he died innocent because he was in the way standing for the real revelation his blood cried the justice blood of abel cried against cain the blood of jesus not only cried out it redeemed it speaks better things it makes you sons and daughters it hides you from the wrath the blood of abel could not hide cain but the blood of jesus can there is forgiveness for cain if he will receive it by grace are you saved now god knows who will and who won't that's his perspective so we should never get in a mind battle am i elected my seater am i not we all have the same opportunity you want to talk about equal opportunity there's no socialism or communism that can compete with gods it's equal opportunity whosoever will let him come but god knows by foreknowledge and election who will and who won't but the door is open hell was not made for humans hell was made for the devil and his angels and brother branham said you got to fight your way to get there god ain't sitting there like zeus ready to just you know blow you into oblivion he did everything he could to save you i want to show you the grace of god did you notice in the prayer lines the thousands of discernment not one time did the angel of the lord ask him what church they went to you want to talk about a display of the mercy and grace of god men that committed adultery were forgiven that instant people that were in sin i just i just heard an incredible testimony that this fellow brought a friend i just i'll just tell you the first testimony he said he went to brother branham's meeting this is years ago and he said he was watching and there was a little girl with legs drawn up like this brother branham said little girl do you believe and he said surely not surely that little girl couldn't get up out of that chair her legs were just withered and he said he said have your daddy lay his hands on you and he laid his hands and he prayed he said honey come up out of that chair and he said her legs straightened out like that she come right up out of the chair and he said and then the power of god fell and brother branham said and you're healed and you're healed and you're healed and you're healed and he said people were coming up out of the wheelchairs and he said he was watching the power of god and one woman laid right there and then other people just kept popping up but that woman laid there and he said he was sitting there watching and they took brother branham and took him off the stage and he was gone he said so i worked my way up to that woman and he said i i stood over her cotton said ma'am did you come here to be healed she said yes he said he told you you were healed she goes he did he goes yeah he said she jumped out of that go away glory he said she was healed and didn't know it many of us were saved and didn't know it glory and he said so then he brought his friend to a meeting he said he was a tough nut to crack he said they sat up in the balcony brother branham is calling people out and he said woman you're about ready to commit murder you have a gun in your purse and you're going up to new york to kill somebody he said don't let the devil do that to you god will take care of it give that gun to that girl next to you and he said his friend jumped up and looked off the balcony and seen that woman reach in the purse and give it to her friend and he looked over and said this is the real thing [Laughter] glory you love the lord see no matter how sinful you are this is a demonstration of the grace of almighty god we complicate it but god has made the path clear for us hell was made for the devil and his angels no matter how sinful you are no matter how stooped in sin no matter how lost you are he died to save the vile sinner there is hope for you there's grace for you men in their limited minds and narrow thinking shut the door of grace when god opened it wide and screams from heaven continually come come it's the preachers that don't have a revelation of grace and i don't mean to discredit preachers god sends preachers but jesus said it he said you shut up the kingdom against men and you don't even let them go in i just want to preach it loud so you understand the grace of god and and job in what revelation that he had in his dispensation stood upon his sacrifice it is so vitally important that you do not look at you you must look at calvary if you ever will be saved it'll be because of calvary if you'll ever do anything for god it'll because what he's done for us you're up and down up and down and we get tired of going in circles we are human beings but he did something permanent that was for you for you for you for me for all of us we can all stream amazing grace how sweet the sound it's your personal faith in christ it's just like someone said you know i trusted the lord and till the rope broke brother bam said oh no don't trust him till it breaks that's the time to trust him if you want god to make a way for you then you got to take him at his word because god's word will bring forth when god speaks it's got to come to pass it can't fail do you believe that now to wait for the prophecy to be fulfilled is another thing and we get caught in that time that's where the problem is john didn't understand in a damp cell what was happening he could not comprehend it and there's a there's a delay there's a time where we're waiting for the word to be fulfilled and we are so selfish because we're in okay do it lord you can shut the door shut the door lord i'm in lord i'm here you can yeah but there's a lot like you and i that would love the same presence the same revelation so we got to hold faith until the fulfillment you love the lord we get in such a hurry i know i feel like i'm holding you along you're a wonderful group to preach to you're pulling it out so joseph i was preaching on joseph this morning roped robed in rainbow colors because he was he represented the holy spirit he had the covenant upon him this message has a covenant upon it and you know that god had already prophesied that it the knees would bow that all the stalks would bow and all the stars and the moon and the sun was going everything was going to bow so this was said and he knew that those were never wrong then everything backfires everything looks totally chaos his brothers hate him and though and don't forget those men are the 24 elders you're going to shake their hand and you're going to think how did you sell your brother out it's the grace of god that's why we're there too every one of us have our bad stories it's just no one else knows about it but the bible told us god knows but the same grace covered them covers us and so they sold him dirty rotten and i often think of joseph because he he was a boy i remember when i turned 21 i thought i was a man and i went out to uh where was it in albuquerque new mexico i lasted three weeks and came with my tail tucked i was so homesick missing mama it was awful i was having dreams and everything and i never dreamed and i often thought how homesick joseph must have been you know to think what is daddy thinking they loved each other i love my son and you love your family you can imagine how that daddy felt that the pain was real homesickness was real and all of this why did my brothers do this this rejection is real but all things will work for the good and so then he goes to potiphar's house and immediately god begins blessing him and then while he's rising all of a sudden the legs get kicked out of it with no explanations and now you're going to the pit and brother branham said how joseph suffered the bible said the word tried him and he's in here in a pit and all of a sudden in the pit here comes the prosperity all of a sudden he finds favor with the guard and things just start moving back and it's as good as it can be in the pit have you ever been there lord i don't know why i'm in this trial but i still see you blessing but i'm in this trial i see you lord i catch a glimpse i look and you're gone i know you're here help me lord i don't understand that's exactly where he wants you he wants you to believe he's caught in this nightmare i see god i think it was job that said i look and he's gone you know where is he hides himself and in his worst moment while he's in there he could have been offended he could have really been offended and it would have turned the tables a different direction but he maintained his attitude he maintained his faith and all the sudden here it comes god has got to bring the vision to pass everything turns around and he begins to rise and he begins to rise and all of a sudden he interprets the dream and you see it fills the garners of egypt i was preaching on it this morning the reason god did it he said it to preserve a posterity upon the earth because that fireman would have killed the whole seat of abraham but god was looking at the bloodline where the messiah would come and he raised up joseph for the purpose of preserving the bloodline for the messiah all things work for the good to them that are called according to his purpose is not understood until the time it's to be understood and all the sudden the light turned on he said don't be angry you didn't sell me god sold me to preserve life and dad he brought dad together who what a joy what a glory god knows this little a light affliction is nothing compared to what we're going to experience over yonder what are you looking at are you looking at the trial are you offended or are you looking at the promise even when the trials are long blessed are sea that is not offended in me all things are working for your good you love the lord you know god sometimes sends trouble just to jerk us back in line amen am i holding you too long blessed is he that is not offended in me you know god told abraham now i'm skipping a lot i just want to go into abraham now god told abraham i will make you a father of nations this was the grace of god the from the chapter 12 on genesis 12 on the entire bible is based off of god's promise to abraham the entire bible from that time and god now god makes a promise to abraham you're going to have a son the bible said that abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong and so it's easy to believe when the promise first comes then a year went by and then sarah said now tell me what he said again they told me i'm going to have a son she had already told her 15 times two years later repeat that again did you tell me everything yes yes i'm gonna gonna have a son what else did he take he didn't tell me anything else well when are we gonna have the son i don't know but we're gonna have it you just make ready then five years goes by and 10 years goes by then 15 years goes by then 20 years goes by tell me what he said huh never mind done forgot it but god made a promise now notice this now 25 years later never changed the thing in abraham never changed he never staggered he believed it just as much how many believe this message as much as the day that you saw it how wonderful because the promise was anchored into abraham's heart and abraham actually grew stronger and stronger 25 years passed and i i want to read this quote this is incredible to me brother branham said all the sudden the herdsmen started feuding complaints were coming in the cattle was becoming very thin and the water supply was getting very low and he said you know it's always the darkest before day you watch a pattern you study that it's always the same always the darkest and then god comes on the scene he said he's now notice satan was trying to tempt them to make them feel they were doing something wrong to block the visitation that god was going to give abraham and sarah wow now the prophet has given insight as they're sitting on the plains of memory and it's hot and the devil wants to block this visitation of god coming and he said when he tempts when he tempts you what is he trying to do he's trying to get you to disbelief the worst thing you can do is disbelieve as soon as you get scared and say maybe i've done this or i haven't done that right the devil has conquered you you can't get it as long as the devil makes you think that perhaps you wouldn't listen to such temptations like that and if you paid attention you may miss the blessing then everything rises out of order maybe if we would just listen to satan we might miss seeing it like sarah did he said see sarah was a little fussy that morning i don't believe brother branham's just talking he said that morning sarah was just a little bit fussy and you know we seen her in the scriptures you know show out a little bit and uh and thank god because the bible tells all sides oh yeah yeah i know everyone's got halos over their head it's amazing you should see it but we're all human beings and we all get a little fussy once in a while pray for me i'm the only one that gets messy so sarah was just a little fussy on the morning of the visitation and you know why brother branham said she was thinking about how lot and his wife went down to sodom and had all the modern caravans and imagine she's standing in front of the mirrors and got her feathers and her fluff and her plumes and you know you know with the thing on her eyelashes and she puffing herself with all the ladies and i'm stuck out here at these flies look at all this dust he tracked dust back into my tent so sick and tired so hot the air conditioning ain't fixed he tells me to cook and i have nothing to cook with dirt pies abraham abraham's outside for a reason lord bring the promise to pass brother branham said he looked and he saw visitors coming and he said they they had dust on their clothes i love the way brother branham describes brother branham said satan was trying to distract sarah from the things of god because satan knew that it was coming and abraham was watching and he sees three men coming how many are looking forward to seeing that day when the dead loved ones come walking through the walls i believe it with everything i'm not ashamed of it the dead loved ones will walk through those walls it'll be brother branham said spirit-filled people are always watching spirit filled people who are always recognizing the presence of god now most people how many people they walked by all right marlon marlin hide out and they just walked right by they had dust on their clothes they just look like you and i and they had a predestinated appointment with an elect abraham he's noticed something because he was watching he was expecting he never lost his faith he never got discouraged god help us not to get discouraged and as they were walking out brother branham said notice the spirit declared them he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere so he could recognize right from wrong all the time that's the way the christian ought to do he said never looking at the bad side and to the good side you're the children of god expecting his blessings he said he ran in and said sarah this is the day of our visitation and he said he run out woo how he said lord give me spiritual eyes help me not to become common even meetings like this or i'm tired lord help me not to miss my visitation abraham told sarah get something on and he takes off running out and she's like again she's in a mood he comes out he washes their feet and he brings them to the outside of the tent i love the way brother branham describes it i believe he's seeing it he said he took the chair and leaned back against the tent he said he was talking to abraham do you think god would come down and lean back in one of these chairs and fellowship with us i believe with all my heart he said where's sarah she's in the tent behind you she's a little fussy this morning oh do you love the lord and he said she missed it she lied right to the face of the angel said i didn't laugh he said but you did brother branham said let us be open let us be willing and blessed is he that is not offended in me you laugh at sarah but do you realize she types you and me she types the church and the church has been the moody one the unspiritual one the weaker one the fussy one dear god 50 years of fussing since brother branham went off the scene but we're still watching i'm not offended that god didn't come in 1977 i'm not offended that false teaching is everywhere these things must be i'm not offended that those that are preaching what brother branham preached is a minority i'm not offended by that i'm not offended that we're a rejected outcast despised little group i'm not offended how many can say amen listen blessed are they who are not offended in me abraham was not offended he was blessed by god how many want to be blessed blessed are the meek blessed are the peacemakers blessed are they that are rejected and called all manner of evil for my name's sake blessed is he that is not offended in me listen i want us blessings i don't want to be caught in my own spirit and i believe with all my heart the same change they were looking for we're looking for on a greater level take god at his word don't be scared the bride is going to be there this message will produce the rapture it will not fail there may not be another next time here it could be over like this but this message will produce it how many would say lord i don't want to be stumbled i don't want to be offended you do things the way that you're going to do them and i know that it'll work for my good help me to have the right kind of character to follow wherever you lead me even if it don't make sense even if it hurts even if i come under the chastening arm of god lord help me not to be offended i want your blessing let us stand our feet soften my heart lord could you play that do you know that song soften my heart lord does your church know that one okay we
