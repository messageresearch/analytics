TRANSCRIPT
========================================
James chapter 1 verse 18 of his own will beget he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures amen so may God bless you you may be seated uh like to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen uh it's a pleasure for me to be here with you this morning as brother Brook said I known him for few years now he has been to our country several times I remember when he came the first time we were in a little classroom uh could be maybe as big as this place slightly smaller and uh we were few at uh we really had a blessed service and the next time when he came we were we are now in our own building and uh we thank God he has been a blessing to us through uh his singing and through his preaching mostly and uh the things that he preached in our country left a very strong impression on our hearts amen and uh we thank our brother he is one of the best examples we have in the message and we really appreciate what the Lord has done in his life and we appreciate his family uh I appreciate the family I'm staying with them amen and I appreciate the atmosphere in the home amen and uh so I bring you greetings from our church in Soto and uh my family I only have two girls that's what the Lord has blessed me with I would have loved to have uh many more children more than that I really love children but I'm happy with what the Lord has given me one Pastor from Congo uh after he got married after you know they had children after many years of marriage and uh you know in Africa that is a reproach if you don't have children uh so people were talking and so on he said well when I married my wife I just saw her not with children around here first of all and second to that I don't want no se SE in my house I want children that I'll go to the Rapture with said my that's something so uh but we we really thank God for our children we thank God for brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith uh now I was asking brother Brooks several times uh how long should I speak and he doesn't want to tell me because uh there is a saying in Africa I'm just saying these things just to to easy my nervs I'll tell you why uh I I don't travel much uh I do travel a lot within South Africa but most of the time I'm home so it's easy to preach at home because I just tell them we are going to continue so I can't say that today amen I can't say that to you now now the most difficult part for me is to start but I will start I was still saying to you that you know uh they say there's a saying there's few sayings there in Africa because you know there's uh one problem that we have in Africa uh not all of Africa some of us we have tried to come out of it but uh it's a hard thing to keep time in Africa very difficult thing so especially in weddings people will say okay we'll start at 9:00 and they come after 4 hours you know so uh like I I was early on my wedding amen I came on time and my wife came one time so God was help was was gracious to us so uh now one white man was saying to this other uh men you knower it's Mandela's tribe that is us so he asked him but why you people can't keep time he said listen we invented this thing and we control this thing this thing doesn't control us but uh I believe that when it comes to the things of God time matters amen so today we are just going to speak on a subject uh just one word fatherhood amen that's what we are going to talk about fatherhood I was saying to brother Brooks it's amazing brother Brenham talk I mean he preached a sermon and he titled it Mother's Day but he never said anything about Father's day but uh we know he said a lot about father amen show us the father and all those messages amen so uh we we are very grateful amen that we have a Heavenly Father amen amen and brother Brenham says he didn't just uh create things and uh left them as they are amen he's interested in what he created amen amen he's very much interested in us amen very much interested in us to a point that he doesn't leave us the Bible says he doesn't leave us he doesn't forsake us brother bam says isra forsook the rock but the rock never forsook them imagine we we even when we beg light God doesn't leave us he goes with you to those places where you go he's right there amen uh he even told Jacob I'll never leave you until I fulfill everything that have spoken about you amen so he followed Jacob all the way to lavan's place everywhere when Jacob was cheat cheating Lan that's a strange fellow he went there he had nothing but when he came out he was uh richer than his master there are people like that amen you know they they they they work and all they do is just steal and steal and and and if you are not careful they can uh uh bring the whole company to uh you know they can bring it down the whole company can be bankrupt because of them amen but God never left him even when he was doing all those things right in that place right in that condition God spoke to him to come back amen and Jacob had to come back so he doesn't leave us so we we are very grateful ful to have a father like that amen now as we start now here James says of his own will he beget us with the word of Truth know we come to this world by the will of God no one chose where he wanted to be born amen God decided those things no one decided that I want to be a boy I wanted to be a girl God decided that amen there's many families that are sitting with girls and they don't have boys you know like my mother-in-law her her tribe she's a the prophet calls them bazas but is basus amen so in that tribe when you get married uh the family that uh you are married in they will give give you a name so her name is mad Danel which means the mother of Daniel guess what my mother-in-law doesn't have a son she she's got four girls till today they're still calling her M Daniel so uh you know the wish never brought Daniel Amen the wish never brought Daniel they wish that he had a son that he would have a son and he would call his name Daniel but Daniel is not here she can't call for Daniel because Daniel is not here amen so you can imagine they had that desire to have a son and they would have called him Daniel he's not there the wish can't bring him here amen it had to take the actual birth to bring Daniel here so we see that you know uh they wanted to have a boy but they have girls and others have boys and they don't have girls and they wish to have a girl and they don't have any girls and other words they wish to have children they don't have children so we didn't even come here by the desires of our parents but we came here by the will of God am amen God at his own time he decided that you would be born in this country in this family and so on and no matter what you had to be born at that time nothing could stop that amen so the will of God is very powerful and even when it comes to the New Birth you know it we we we are not born again according to our own will no as much as you know I couldn't choose to be taller than what I am amen or to be brother than what I am amen I had to I mean God decided all those things amen and uh same thing here when it comes to the New Birth it is God who decides amen amen and and we are born again by his word of Truth word of Truth amen word of Truth so any man's ideas won't work for us that cannot bring any new birth de but it has to take God to give the word to reveal the word in that age no you cannot even be born again you know by the message of Luther in this age no no no no no okay let me let me just uh say it like this we know uh Aon had a bre breastplate now that breastplate of Aon it had 12 Stones so then there's 12 tribes of Israel so every Israelite is born under one of those stones so it's either you are the tribe of Reuben or Benjamin or whatever Tri tribe you are but you are born under a stone yes those are Jews now that's Israel now but when it comes to the Gentiles we are born again under AAR right so those who lived in the times of Paul in the age of Ephesus there was no way for you to be born again any other way but through that message under that star yeah all the way down to this age that we are living in I tell you even when we were in the Pentecostal churches we were not born again no it was not a birth it was a false birth because there's no truth there there's no word of truth if there is then the question is what are you doing here then you better go back but we came out because there's no truth there amen and uh and everything was just false false water baptism false New Birth false pastors false everything is false false Church everything was just false amen amen but now when when we come under the word of our day that's the only time that we can be truly born again where your life is exactly like the life of God Amen but I normally say if they say this message is so false how can a false message produce such pure lives you know like uh in Africa that's the only hope we have our politics are messed up everything is messed up and everything that came to us you know uh when it came from anywhere from Europe the Lutheran gospel when it came from Europe it was already a denomination by the time it reached Africa you know you even the the Pentecostals yeah it was already a denomination when when the assembl of God and them came down there it was already a denomination but the only thing that came to us that was never a denomination it was this message amen and it is and it is throughout the whole world the only hope that we have is this message of the hour amen we have seen God change lives we have seen God change your homes amen there's uh uh it cannot be disputed amen so but you see the message of Noah was the will of God but in the time of Moses it was the word of God but it was not the will of God in the time of Moses reading it yes it is the word of God but trying to build the ark and cross the Red Sea that's not the will of God Amen so God's will for the day was to open the sea amen not cross over it with the ark no so building an ark in the days of Moses it was not the will of God Amen yes it is the word of God but it was the word of it was the will of God in the times of Noah amen amen so we realize that in the days of Moses God had a plan for that day he told Abraham that your seed will soen in a Strange Land and when they are they are in that Strange Land I will visit them and I'll take them out with a mighty hand so we know how they went there and how Joseph was sold and uh and I tell you brother sister sometimes our the people that we think they are our enemies those people they are the ones that we need in our lives amen you know the people that love you they are they are wonderful it's wonderful to be loved and every one of us wants to be loved it's good to have people who love you amen it soothes you it encourages you and all that but we need negative people amen amen I mean the the the the brother of Joseph never loved Joseph but because of that hatred they were they were helping Joseph to fulfill the purpose that God had about the life of Joseph if he had people who just loved him and who who never hated him he wouldn't have he wouldn't have you know come to a place where his life fulfill the will of God so he needed these people who hated him and I think we also need people who hate us brother sister it's not an easy thing to say but that's the truth that's the truth so they hated him they never loved him and uh and they sold him amen and to the midianites and the medit sold him to pona he's like he's getting further away from the dreams amen because yeah his brothers they are left behind amen and his father is Left Behind well they sold him to the m but when the meites sold him to Bona his brothers didn't know about that but that didn't bother Joseph what a strong testimony we have from this life I mean at the age of 17 that's when all these things happen to him he came to a country where he was the only Christian everybody doesn't worship God he he couldn't even you know fellowship with no one he couldn't even you know uh uh sing hymn with no one he was all by himself throughout the whole country but in it all amen God's grace kept him one time I was looking at the you know the there's a certain documentary they made and they were they they invented a little camera they put they put it on the back of beds and then they also put it on the back of an eagle just to see how they fly and all that and as this Eagle was flying a storm came up very powerful storm but they noticed something that the eagle went through the storm even the storm didn't divert it from its course it went right through it I said praise God there is Eagles right here in the scripture one of them is Joseph all the things that happened in his life never diverted his cause he still he still remained true and faithful to God I said Lord help me to be strong like that my trials my testing my my everything that comes my way may I never never lose the vision of Jesus may I still stay focused so brother sister may God help us amen and I believe that you know everything that comes our way we will be able to master it amen we can Master anything that comes our way so Joseph stayed faithful they sold him he came into Pontius house Pontius saw that God is with him and he made him uh Steward in his house and he was an overseer of everything there and uh uh God bless the home of pontia because of Joseph and I believe brother and sister this same God of this Bible is the same today all these places are blessed because we are still here amen it may not look that way it may not sound that way it may be it may seem like all these prominent names you know in the political realm and and and business and all that they are the ones who are running things here no things are happening because we are here amen because of we are here amen God is blessing places because we are here the way the day we live this place is going to be chaos here amen I mean these people the weapons that they have and the hatred that they have and you know when they are far from God and they don't even believe there's God but there's something that is is keeping them not to blow each other amen because we are here you can even read it in the Book of Revelation amen chapter 7 God didn't just hold the four wings only for the 144,000 he is holding it because there's a bride also here because we are here amen God must still do something in us he must still seal those who don't have the Holy Ghost you must still save those who are without God Amen that's why we are still here amen can I say something here to encourage us you know brother sister it's amazing let's take for an example a peach tree a peach tree it blossoms all at the same time those little flowers they become little peaches at the same time but you know what you won't eat all those peaches at the same time from that tree not from another tree same tree there will be those will get ripe first amen you eat those first the others are still there you eat those you become sick they are still green some of them and it's amazing it's a paradox they are on the same tree same nourishment same s same everything they they should be ripe at the same time but no it doesn't work like that so we might be in the same church same message but we don't mature at the same time amen some of us are not yet ripe amen it doesn't mean that they won't get ripe some are in and out of church it seems like they're not settled but brother sister there's something that pulls them in there's something about a true child of God when the word is spoken something happens in their soul though there might be F fightings in the mind and and battles here and there and so on but the word of God has got an effect on a child of God they can't deny it they can't resist it they can't deny it they may not have surrendered now but it's just a matter of time amen it's just a matter of time so we see that Joseph in the house of Piva God wanted him higher than that now with God the way up is down so they had to take him out sometimes we get mad we get angry when we are falsely accused but it happened it even happened to Joseph the wife of pontier was after him so it shows that money and riches and all those is not all that life is about here is a woman a wife of a very rich man and he's after a Hebrew boy who doesn't own nothing so there was something that Joseph heard that the husband didn't have there was something she saw something in this young man but then she goes after Joseph and so on and Joseph resisting that and one day they were Joseph went there and they were they were just two in the house and she grabbed Joseph you can imagine I mean pains and all those things they come from Egypt okay maybe she dressed in a sexy way and Joseph never saw that painted her ey you know her lips green and then purple and this color and that color Joseph doesn't notice all those things then it h she realized no no no no no then I have to do it physically and she grabbed him he left his jacket and he ran away then he appeared before this judge and the judge held his jacket son is this jacket part of that trouser that you are wearing yes sir this jacket and that that jacket and this trouser it's a suit okay so on such a day you were there yes now this thing over the boy is guilty you know uh then he was uh uh sentenced attempted rape that was the case now he couldn't argue that no he couldn't argue that but he answered with his life there are times you cannot you know brother sister God help us we cannot answer everyone we don't know owe everyone an answer but the life our life before every man must be a Godly life let's answer with our lives so Joseph was falsely accused and there he is now he ends up right in Dungeon if there was a man who was supposed to give up on God this was a man but he never understood what was going on but somehow election held election held something kept him amen like brother Brenham says I I I I want God to keep me so that when I cannot hold on anymore he can hold me those times they come those times they come but uh Joseph he continued on he came into prison he was not with you know kind men he was with men of terrible Spirits right in prison the the head of prison realized no God is with Joseph Joseph has got a better control over these Spirits than I so he must be in charge of the prison so he was in charge and he was controlling everything and and because Joseph had come there's no gang fights and all those things and and you know he was in control and we know the story about the dreams amen and because of those dreams and he interpreted the dreams he took another two years the battler forgot him he took another two years but God took him out from down there and he became the second in charge in Egypt pontif wife under Joseph under Joseph he could he could have revenged him he he could have done all sorts of things but brother sister because he is a child of God Vengeance it was not even in his mind everything under his feet prison you name it even the very judge that sentenced him under him amen I tell you one of these days it will happen Hallelujah yes brother sister it will happen amen I believe it I believe it it may not look like that now that everything is under our feet but brother and sister we are getting there amen we are getting there every child of God must come to that point am I was telling the church okay let me not say that that's just a message on his own let me leave it I still feel that I should say it you know brother Brenham says brother Brenham said in stch of a perfect man I think it's uh paragraph 172 to uh where he says I just paraphrase the thing he said uh he's trying his best that every member of the Tabernacle must become this message now when we talk about every member of the Tabernacle now brother Brenham Tabernacle is not the Brenham Tabernacle we remember very well how God told him that's not your Tabernacle amen so we are here we are part of brother bam tacle whether so to wherever we are part of that so I said you see I saw something there that every me now when we talk about every member we're not talking about the elderly people only even Sunday school is included every one of us must become the message my life your life everybody's life you know uh uh the reason why I stand behind the desk is that people should become the message amen not only that if you go a little bit backwards then he said he is not sent to build an organization but he is sent to build an individual to become a Powerhouse amen now under the message we don't follow this man because he's got an anointing or we follow that one because he he is the anointed man and that one no every one of us must become powerhouses powerhouses even this little fellows right in Sunday school they must become powerhouses so it's not just supposed to be me as a pastor or Pastor Isaiah or or any Minister you know brother Troy or whoever no every one of us brother sister is not only men even women yes even women you know brother bam speaks of a sister in the message uh the sixth sent this sister she had a dream and the devil came to her making all the funny faces and she said get out of here and told Brother Brenham Brenham gave the interpretation the prophet says uh there she was in the home with her husband they would be killed and is not a problem but in times like that that's when Moses was born amen he was an answer to prayer yes sir and not just an answer to prayer but born to fulfill the word of God when God spoke to Abraham the prophet says God had Moses in mind so God doesn't just speak the word no he's got people who already fulfill that word part of the we is spoken part of it rich part of it is US amen amen part of it is us like when the Bible says in the beginning was the word it was not the riching word it was not even the spoken word it was the Living Word The Living Word spoke the word for us to speak the word we must be the living word amen so every day God is just putting weight upon weight upon weight and every day we are getting better we are getting better every day that's why brother sister I I I used to worry a lot and so on but I don't worry no more brother says you know our duty is to plant the seed God will take care of it amen amen so some people you you labor on them you talk to them and so on then they argue and they fast and so on but you know it's coming from here but the word is for here amen amen so they may be arguing from here but deep down here something else is happening and at the right time that word amen it has to bring forth am so we see that you know Pharaoh killing the children and so on and Moses was born at the time the Bible says the parents of Moses they were not afraid of the king that's right now Moses was a normal baby ye he also cried the whole night they had sleepless nights and so on but the Bible says they were not afraid where there's fear there's no faith where there's Faith there's no fear amen amen so they were not afraid they knew that this boy is born to fulfill the scriptures so you can imagine at night Moses is crying and maybe he's teething or whatever the problem is and he's crying and crying and uh the soldiers they knock on the door open AMR just opens the door hey sorry sir we had a baby crying and he's still crying we had a baby crying sorry he's not in this house we'll go next door they couldn't just get this baby no not this one but Pharaoh was busy killing children and killing children looking for this one then God said okay you are looking for him I'll give him to him then they put Moses in a little Ark mother of Moses put Moses in a little Ark made a little AR for Moses and we know how she pitched it and so on put Moses in it and it was sailing Down the River Nile all those crocodiles that have been fed on Jewish uh Israelite babies and uh h they were there but the Angels gathered around the ark amen and it was sailing and sailing and sailing and it came right where the daughter of pharaoh was before she could take a bath and the the the security GS they stopped reached for this Ark and they came out with a little baby and he started crying and when they looked it's a Jewish child but she said my father killed all of them not this one you won't touch this one uh God poured all the motherly love into the heart of Pharaoh's daughter then she took Moses and while she was holding Moses Miriam stood next to her imagine how did she get so close to the princess what were the gods doing but when God God is moving nothing can stop him nothing can stop him thank you Lord and then Miriam said I'll get you aness oh is that so yes I'll get you someone that will take care of him oh go and bring her by the way this is the password but she was standing there without a password this is the password she went brought her mother and the prophecy is God is full of those extra blessings amen yeah is Moses mother has been blessed with a child but God gave an extra blessing she got paid for looking after her own baby and then she was right in the enemy's territory she taught Moses about God without the Bible because the Book of Genesis was written by Moses but she taught Moses about God oh God help us so you realize that we have a respons a ability and we have all the material the materials around us to teach our children right so may God may God help us amen and she taught Moses about God and you know and Moses growing there and you can imagine just to go back a little bit faraoh he would go on his business for the day and they kill so many and uh Jewish boys and he comes back and uh he's rocking this baby to sleep the very one he's looking for right in his hands but he can't find it brother BR says in adoption part three he says God can seal you until the devil can find you there is Moses so hidden right in the house of pharaoh but Pharaoh can't find him amen amen and he grew up in that home Like An Egyptian he did everything as an Egyptian but mother was telling him you are not an Egyptian and when he was of age he refused by faith what a g me you know brother he he didn't refuse because he has seen the pillar of fire no no no no he made a decision before he even saw the first miracle nobody pushed him into it amen it came from his own heart leaving the palace and by choice becoming a MCD Dober and and and he did that and and came out and he identified himself with the children of Israel it was a wonderful thing he killed one Egyptian messed the whole thing up and he ran away he abandoned the whole thing but brother bam says when God made man he made him to be a free moral agent he says when God made men to be in partnership with him that is Christ the Myster of God revealed paragraph 168 he says God made men to be in partnership with him so when Moses did it without God it failed and God couldn't do it without Moses because they are in Partnership so God had to go and find first his partner and bring him back amen so brother and sister me and you we are also in partnership with God that's why we should never start a day without prayer amen you should not live your life without God because you are in Partnership amen we must have a conference with God every morning conference every day conference before we do anything we must have a a conference you know some of those uh partnership it is uh s and so and Sons so you can be in Partnership even with your own children so that's what is going on here God is in partnership with his children father God With Us in Partnership this thing is very serious very very serious God couldn't even destroy Sodom and gomorra without talking it over with Abraham he's got a partner he had to go and have a conference with Abraham and he spoke it over with him first and you know so now partnership is not the you are not an employee when you are a partner no as an employee as an employee you decisions are made and you must carry them out you might have your own ideas but you are not in Partnership here you are just a supervisor or a manager or whatever but when you are in Partnership you you you you you you discuss things you discuss amen so Abraham said yes Lord I hear what you say but if there's 50 will you still destroy them no Abraham in our company we don't do things like that if there's 50 Russia people we won't destroy Sodom and gomorra because the 50 lives of Russia people there will stop everything we don't work like that in this company abrah so you know it's a conference so brother sister hey God help us you know the message is so powerful just think of it we we are not just Sinners saved by grace we are not just you know just just servants we we are in partnership with god brother says God can never save a sinner until you project Divine love to that sinner is partnership amen when we have a bearing about somebody then God will do something about that person amen it's partnership so Moses God had to go and find him and when he found him he was looking after sheep there and uh God came and spoke to him uh he said I've come down I've heard the cries of my people imagine people praying for 400 years it's like the prayer is just eating the ceiling here but when God came he said I have heard their cries no prayer that God doesn't hear amen he hears prayer he answers prayer so I have heard the cries of my people I've come down to deliver them but Moses you go so he he he must go God can do it alone Moses can't do it alone they must do it together so now where we see God and Moses coming back to Egypt and when Moses came he told Pharaoh I met God and he told me to tell you you must let his people go who is God who is the Lord you know and and mooses said okay I'll show you a sign and he dropped the stick and the rod became a snake Pharaoh laughed he said that's just a cheap magician trick Jan's G come and they did the same thing Moses has done his part now God the partner of Moses did the rest he showed he did something that that Moses never saw behind the behind the desert there no no no no no no at the back side of the desert but then the snake of Moses swallowed j jesis snake J's snake and when Moses left he had a rot they didn't have rot amen amen that's it moved from one thing to another remember he told God I can't speak but God said who made M God didn't just make him able to speak he even spoke like his father H father God in Genesis 1 he said let there be let there be let there be Moses also he said let there be flies Let There Be frogs amen and there were frogs so he's speaking exactly like his father you know election time is a very strange time they in in in our countries there you will find you will see strange things the big man the president he will go go and go down to a to a ghetto go to a you know a small little place no running water nothing and he'll be sitting there on a uh you know uh little bucket and he will be talking to someone there is just because it's election time he has come there not to not for that guy to be the president no he has only come his intention of coming there is because he wants to run for second time okay he want second term so then it will be all over the place but there's something about God when God comes to you he's coming so that you should be God yes yes when he came to Moses if you read Exodus 7 verse1 he said I have made you God Amen so when God comes to us you become God that's why he comes so that you should become like him you should become his child you should become God a dog gives birth to a dog a cat gives birth to a cat God gives birth to God amen amen so he com so that you should be God you should be a Powerhouse amen so he came to Moses so that Moses must be God and he is spoke like God Amen Let There be let there be let there be he speaks it God brings it to pass what the partnership what a partnership very powerful so he moved from one thing to the other it was wonderful when he spoke frogs into existence and all those things but they were still in bondage but it came a time when they went to service and Moses said now now we are you are going to go home and clean up your house take all the living out after you have taken the living then bring the lamb so all this time it was Moses Moses Moses stretching the rod water becoming uh you know blood and uh uh uh speaking this and uh you know speaking the word and flies they come and you know bringing Darkness on Egypt and all those things but this time now they must become part of the message they must take the message and go and practice it so they must go home clean out the living we wouldn't have known what living is until Malachi forame amen we we wouldn't have known how to clean our homes am amen amen it's only through this message so then the prophet comes and he tells us to kick the televisions out and all these ungodly things we take them out and then we see that people they once kicked them out now they're bringing them back I don't know what's going on today but it must be that way we clean everything out televisions out and all the short dresses and the mini skats and and the shorts and the cuts and everything and the beer bottles and everything out so that's how that's theiving today amen amen it's amazing that Exodus never took place in a church it took place in a home in a home that's how important a home is amen they didn't apply the blood at the door of the church no on the Angel there above the door of the church no it was at their homes they ate the lamp in the home the prophet says the the father became the priest of the home you see so as fathers we have to be praying amen praying fathers praying for our children praying for you know uh for our loved ones amen amen you know we we should be priests in our homes making intercession and making sure that we read the word to our children and so on there is a part that we play you know you you you correct the children you teach them the right things and so on but there's also a part that God must do that we know amen so we do our part the best we can then God will do the other part amen amen amen because you know you you may know scriptures you may know all these things that doesn't make you a Christian the devil knows the Bible he was quoting into Jesus in Matthew 4 it is written it is written it is written he's still a devil even today amen that didn't change him am all right so we may know the message we can quote the message and that's why it it shouldn't Shake us even when we see people leaving the message it shouldn't Shake us no no no no no no no don't don't it shouldn't Shake us one bit amen this is still the truth it is not man who must weakness to the things of God sir no one witness to the me to the ministry of Moses but God himself even Paul say so he said God gave bear them witness it's written like that in in Hebrews chapter 2 so the there's no greater weakness than God so this message God witnessed to it that it is the truth and he's still witnessing to it by Chang ing the people's lives am amen so it shouldn't Shake us amen but what I'm trying to say here is this we do our best but we know there is a part that God must do like the mother of Moses she taught Moses the truth she taught Moses everything about God but she could not work in the heart of Moses only God works in the heart only God works in the heart I mean in that message life 1957 uh brother speaks about that girl that uh went to college and she was working there uh with a psychiatrist and how the aat sat her down and talked to her and uh told her girl have you ever uh Been Kissed by a boy no oh you don't know what you are missing have you ever uh you know taken a little bit of beer or this and that no oh girl you are missing quite a lot and it went on like that and and the prophet said she him him being a psychist moved her mind from Christ to what he was talking about and she became evil and bad when her thoughts were on Christ she was a Christian when her thoughts were moved away from Christ then she fell from Grace there the propes he goes to say that's what preaching is all about is to move your thoughts to something higher to a place where Christ is until you are converted so you see preaching doesn't even work in the soul it's working in the mind we don't we don't do anything in the heart we don't do anything in the soul only God works there amen even the woman of the world the prophet says the woman of the world knew the scripture better than the priest yeah so you realize that the preacher did a very good job on that woman she knew the Bible very well but her life was a mess but when Jesus came he went and worked in a spot that the preacher never reached amen and from that time she was never the same that's why we preach we preach we preach but after preaching we pray that God may come and Quicken these things in our lives Quicken these things in our children amen I was telling my children I said you are part of what I'm doing you are just part of what I'm doing I'm preaching and you are part of this ministry though you are girls you cannot stand behind the pull pit and preach but you must be beging what I'm saying with your lives amen you must be beging what I'm saying with your lives uh it will make make things easier for me amen you know uh we are living in a country that is just gone very bad it's in Africa but he no longer part of Africa we have uh a terrible Constitution to a point that it's like a crime now to have children because you must just have them don't correct them don't discipline them you raise your voice speaking with them they they it abuse abuse abuse and uh that's the only way they know now there's nothing like discipline there's nothing like correction and and and it's so bad it's so bad politicians are not honest they never grew up like that themselves amen they were corrected they were beating up they they went to schools that were very strict our schools was like almost like the the military you know you you get beating up you you you you you you and with us the way we grew up any man that is as old as your father is your father you meet that man on the street you will be accountable before him as your father you do any wrong thing he will give you a hiding right there like your father don't you dare tell your father about it because you're going to get another hiding you'll tell you that man can be wrong you know anyone any woman that is as old as your mother is your mother that's how it is you know but those are the those are the values that we have but because of politicians those things have been changed and and and is not good for our children is not good for our children but in it all we thank God for the message there is something that can straighten things out amen so our hope is not even in that so I'm not even looking at that I told them I said I don't regard them am amen we don't regard that we we don't believe in that we believe in the Bible and that's what we do amen I I you know he so bad he so bad the other day a small little boy of about seven years was hitting a teacher as old as our brother Rich here with a broomstick in the class and the other little fellows they were video videoing that with their little phones and so on and it was on YouTube and everywhere and there's nothing wrong with a child according to that Society in my days that would be something else that would have been something else that teacher had a right to beat the boy up and if he goes home mother will give him another hiding big brother will do it and father will do it he he will never do that again for the rest of his life he will never do it again those things were good I mean I also had that and I realize I tell the people that you know if I never had a father that that did that to me I wouldn't be a preacher today I would have done very bad things and I wouldn't even been qualifi to be a preacher but I had a dad who really disciplined me I had teachers who disciplined me and that made me what I am today amen and I knew while I was still a child I knew I was wrong okay so you must pray for us amen so I was telling the kids even in our church I said no no no no no you don't do that none of you must do such things when you go to school go on time and be a a Christian Child you are there to reflect Christ you are there to reflect Christ amen don't be part of all this confusion don't be part of this chaos amen you you you represent Christ and and you you have respect you show respect even when you talk to your teachers even when they are wrong and you are right you still show respect because you are doing it unto Christ brother BR him said so your attitude to anyone is your attitude to Christ not your attitude to Christians your attitude to anyone amen amen so uh we we keep it like that so is not an easy thing amen but we know uh greater is he that is in us than the one that is in the world amen we are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus amen so we we pray we hold on and we thank God you know for the children that this message has produced we really thank God Amen and for for the ministry and for for for the churches and and we thank God for all that now coming back to Moses this Moses we find that he continued like that amen because he's a Son of God he has to do do things like his father you do things like your father one time Jesus hanging on the cross the thief on the left said to him if you are the Son of God he was speaking like somebody that statement was not made for the first time that time the devil said the same thing to Jesus if you are the Son of God so this guy also was speaking like his father so Moses also spoke like his father let there be flies let there be this my right in his own life his father was reflected so they had to take now the lamp bring into the homes and uh don't uh boil it roast it with fire it all happened in the home and uh they applied the blood and uh they they came under the blood and when the death angel was passing and there was a cry here there was a cry there brother bam says in that message job he said it was an insult to be afraid when you are under the blood it will be an insult to God so when Israel came under the blood no fear amen when we are also under the blood today no fear amen amen no fear it was a wonderful thing no Prophet no lamb no token no Deliverance no Exodus today the same way no Prophet no Holy Ghost no Prophet no church no nothing so Grace gave them a prophet Grace gave them a lamb and you know when and brother sister imagine they had to come under the blood it didn't matter what sort of Life they lived so long as they are under the blood when the blood was a where the blood was applied you knew very well that there the message has been accepted amen and they accepted the message and and they they they didn't just you know take anything that was popular no they took something that was an abomination in Egypt a Shepherd is an abomination in Egypt but if the same man uh changes and he heads cattle he not an Abomination so what was really an Abomination is not the man is sheep so what was not accepted in Egypt that which was rejected that's where your token came from even Jesus when he he hang on the cross that which Israel the whole of Israel had rejected that's where the Holy Ghost came from amen so even today this message is not accepted everywhere it's something that has been rejected and from this rejected word that's where the Holy Ghost comes from amen because the Holy Ghost follows the word the proph is the the Holy Ghost is a conductor of the weight amen so once again we see here brother and sister that this message the prophet says it's not it but it is him Christ the lamb so eating the lamb today is feasting on this message and I read something that is very powerful one of the the the the authorities of medicine he said uh make food your medicine so we don't just we shouldn't just eat because of the taste we should eat because we want to be well make food your medicine and make medicine your food so but we know most of these things now are contaminated H they are purified by prayer amen but when it comes to the spiritual matters we we should make food our medicine we Feast on the word to keep healthy spiritually amen and we Feast on the word to cure spiritual diseases amen amen so as we Feast on the word we become healthy we become fit amen I tell you you know when you start the day with prayer when you start the day with reading the word and so on no matter what comes you are ready for it but if the day is a bit messed up and we don't start the day with prayer we don't start the day by reading the word and so on we are in deep trouble so it seems like everything just keeps going wrong amen so they had to eat the lamb amen and they were they were supposed to eat the whole lamb that's strong hey they whole lamb amen now brother and sister right in that lamb there is a g bladder now the Bible says eat the whole L and that thing is real b g bladder when we Slaughter you know once G bladder can spill on the on on on the carcass I tell you there's nothing that can cure that you can put salt you can put all kinds of spices the meat will still be terrible it will be bitter so imagine they had to eat eat everything you don't just eat lamb chops you don't eat just you know the parts that you like you must eat everything including the G blad so when it comes to the word we don't just take parts that are so nice and wonderful we we must even take things that are against us amen it was not easy brother it was not easy for Moses to say to the people thou shall not kill who is talking he has killed an Egyptian he's a murderer himself but he that word because he has done that no he brought it as it is H he tells Israel you must not marry outside Israel but he's sitting with an ethopian woman he never changed that word so it was not a nice thing for him but brother sister that's the word he was not a suicide bomber because some preachers they want to lower the standards because of you know our shortcomings shortcomings of uh you know children family and all that and and sometimes you know because of membership and all those things for so so many different reasons but Moses never done it when I saw that I said Lord help me I preach it I preach it I preach it where I'm failing I will go on the altar with my church and I pray I say Lord I preached it help me also amen so when we do it like that then it helps all of us anyway a pastor grows with his church amen we are growing we are all growing amen all coming to Perfection all of us amen so we we realize here that they had to eat the whole lamb my and uh they did it and Pharaoh chased them out of Egypt they didn't run away just chase them out I want to read something here let's just go to Hebrews 11 I will close in a short while at least we have started we will continue this is one chapter that's incomplete in the whole Bible this is one chapter that is incomplete I mean even when we read here uh yeah Paul say so let me read somewhere here verse 32 and what shall I more say for time would fail me to tell of Gideon of Barack of Samson of jaffna jafta of David also and Samuel and of the prophets not a coma not a full stop hen still continuing incomplete you see these are Heroes of Faith he can't complete it because we were also coming amen we were also coming this chapter is not complete it cannot be complete you your name must be included here my name and that brother that sister everyone you can complete this chapter we are also Heroes of Faith amen amen incomplete let me say this it's amazing I mean when you read this year it says by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than dead of Cain then he goes to Enoch by faith he was translated it goes to Noah it goes to Abraham listing different things all happened by faith not a different Faith same Faith same Faith by faith in was translated by faith Abraham you know when he was old he received Isaac and by faith you know Enoch was translated by Faith by Faith by faith the walls of Jericho fell by Faith by faith and brother B says perfect Faith Masters all circumstances amen same Faith different circumstances right in the book of Hebrews 11 but where we want to read is here from verse 23 by faith Moses when he was born was he three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to yes refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season so faith is a revelation also of who I am so by faith Moses knew his identity it was a revelation the Bible goes on esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect and to the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt now it doesn't say by faith they forsook Egypt by faith he forsook Egypt so Moses believed for the whole of Israel and they left Egypt because of the faith of Moses oh God help us so you realize that my faith your faith must put us in amen amen so I have to believe for my whole church pastor Must Believe for the whole church we must believe for one another you believe for pastor I believe for you oh God help us hallelujah so Moses in Israel he was the father of the whole of Israel the house of Moses was the whole of Israel brother sister imagine he believe for their dogs he believe for their donkeys he believe for their cat he told Fara that he said we won't even leave a wolf here yes he believe for the animals we are not living even a wolof here he didn't just believe for them he belied for their animals as well oh God help me what a father that was now that's why Paul could say here let's read here Hebrews 3 verse one wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house so the house of Moses it was the whole the whole of Israel that's why in that message th house braim speaks of he read uh okay I think we can read we can read let's go to act 16 we read there Acts chapter 16 let's read verse 25 and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners H them them hey this is this is a very touching story here these men of God have been falsely accused because they Paul cast out a devil out of a fortune taer and they were put in stocks the prophet said there's rat in there there was rat in there there was all kinds of insects and so on they should have been depressed stressed but the Bible says they prayed and said s Praises unto God God help us situations mustn't change us no matter what goes wrong brother sister there is a reason for that we may not understand it but there is a reason so all we continue doing praying praising God and singing and so on and so even if you can't hold a tune you must sing amen amen not only the singers must sing everybody must sing and the Bible says suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's BS were loosed the prophet says those walls were falling away from them not AB them right and the keep of the prison awaking out of uh he sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here then he called for a light and uh sprang in and came trembling fell down before Paul and silus and brought them out and said s what must I do to be saved they said said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ thou shall be saved and thy house and thy house amen so he must believe for himself and his hous amen so this man's house yes they were saved the prophet he took that uh those words there thy house and he he started speaking on that but the house of Moses was not just all those of his household it was the whole of Israel and right in that message the prophet said I am holding on for every brother in my church I'm holding for every sister in my church so we had a prophet that believed for us amen amen even in perfect Faith he said it he said come I'm believing for you just come amen so we we we thank God so that's the house of Moses by faith he left Egypt so it happened by the faith of Moses if a man could believe for 2 million people and their animals and so on my home is very small amen my home is very small my church is very small amen so you you realize that we can believe for everybody in this messag am we can even believe for those who are bleading brother we believe and we trust God and we continue believe until they are brought back amen the prophecy is we don't give up on nobody we give up on a person when he's dead so long as they are alive There's Hope for them amen so Moses believ the believe for all of them the faith of Moses took them out of bondage deliver at them amen the faith of Moses let's read on we are still there in 11 uh Hebrews 11 uh verse 27 by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he enjoed as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover it's only Moses all the time and the sprinkling of the blood lest he that destroyed the first born should touch them now verse 29 by faith they pass through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians are saying to do were drowned now that's Moses let's just close with another example here Father Abraham [Music] amen read something here in Genesis 19 so we know Abraham took Lord his nephew with him Lord never met God never saw any Supernatural he just heard Uncle Abraham saying I met God and uh Lord was just following he was there with Abraham his heart is in Sodom when opportunity arose he went to to Sodom there in Sodom it was not good for him one time captured by the Kings and Abraham came after him Abraham never said you see this is a Vindication that God is with me look at him now no he went after him even when lot you know left him he still went after lot and fought delivered lot delivered all those people of Sodom and and uh you know and after the the slaughtering of those kings that's when Abraham met melkisedek kedc met a man that had such a brotherly love such a love for lot even when lot the the the the the Shepherds of lot you know strove with his own Shepherds and and so on and he told Lord we don't have to have strives here whatever way you go I'll go the opposite direction if you go to the east I go to the West if you go west I go to the to the East and Lord was given the best amen he was given the best and he made his own choice but Abraham still loved him even when time came now for Sodom and gomorra to be destroyed now we know Three Angels Came to Abraham in Genesis 18 there other one remained with Abraham and the other two went to Sodom it's amazing three came when they were with Abraham only one spoke to Abraham the other two were quiet the prophet shows that you know it was God in one place he say is god with worm hood and Gabriel you know and and and and there they were and he shows that these Three Angels they are a shadow or or rather yes a shadow of what is happening in our day there's only three seeds here amen Pentecostal seeds shown by Oral Roberts that's right and then the other seed shown by Billy Graham and the other seed for the El sown by William Brenham just three Three Angels Came and the other two were quiet and only Elohim was speaking to Abraham because there others they never had a message for Abraham Abraham needed a body changing message so today oral Robert Billy wonderful people but they don't have a message for me because also in this day we need a body changing message and the change must start within in the soul first amen and then there it was and and uh they came remember all this time Sarah also she just heard Abraham saying God spoke to me let's get out of here where are we going in the book of Hebrews 11 the Bible says Abra left and he didn't know where he was going God just led him and led him where are you going Abraham there was no Bible no no he couldn't show them here is a verse here is a scripture here no no no God just spoke to him and he spoke to him alone Sarah and them there just to follow now Genesis 18 yeah God is talking to Abraham he said I will visit you according to the time of life Sarah thy wife shall conceive and Sarah was innot and innot he was inent according to 2 Corinthians 5 this body is a tacle attent so we are not this body the real you is your soul so she was in attent and being in this body also in aent I think that helps us with a with the tent Vision amen Sarah in a tent and this five this body of five senses is a tent she's also inited and she was laughing oh my goodness today my husband has received Friends that talk exactly like him because she was thinking he is old he never spoke like this when he was young now we're going to have a baby now I must need booties here and all those things she has never met by the way Sarah never met God yet God came here in Genesis 18 and then why did he come to take away all the doubts and the unbelief of Sarah and Sarah said my goodness what's going on today and Abraham was rejoicing and you know he told Sarah to cook a special meal and God said why did Sarah laugh she realized yeah I laughed in my heart how did he know that then she realized no no no no no no no this one is God Only God can do that not an ordinary man can do that then it just took one year Isaac was born so as much we could say Sarah this Sarah that but she never met God until Genesis 18 then God remained with Ibraham the other two angels went to Sodom let's just read here Genesis 1 I mean Genesis 19 we read verse one there came two angels to Sodom at even and Lord sat in the gate of Sodom and Lord seeing them rose up to meet them and bowed himself with his face toward the ground and he said behold now my Lord turn in I pray you into your servant's house and T all night and wash your feet and he shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night hey hey you can imagine the streets of Sodom all the wickedness is in the streets yes I mean like if we go to the streets of this city here that's all the wickedness is you come to to Johannesburg in the house it should be better but imagine the what sort of a home is this that the Angels don't even want to go in there they can rather stay out there with all those gay men and whatever huh there's something wrong in this house of lot so God must help us we must have a home like that of Abraham Where Angels can visit us amen remember some of us will be raptured in our homes to two will be sleeping one shall be taken one shall be left some of us will be raptured in our own homes so we must make our homes make our church make our lives you know to be welcoming to the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Spirit must feel welcomed now but let's just go somewhere won't stay long there right there in that chapter there's something I wanted to it we just building up to it it's marked in my little thing there I'll find it just now so we should have a a home like that amen the prophet says once you are a Christian uh once you are born again you are associated with the Unseen World you're associated with the Unseen World just look for it right here find it faster I didn't mark it on my Bible yet there's a verse I'm looking for bear with me so it's it's a wonderful thing to have a a caring father like God Amen now this vers right yeah yes verse 29 verse 29 and it came to pass when God destroyed the seties of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which Lord dwelt not remembered lot remembered Abraham so Abraham was holding for lot so God remembered Abraham and he took lot he was holding not just for lot for lot and his wife and his daughters Lord didn't want to go out if you read there in Genesis 19 Lord didn't want to go out the Angels they had to grab him pull him out grab his wife grab his daughters God remembered Abraham took lot out right I think I'm done but let me read this let me read just this quotation is just a blessing this one amen I know what brother bam said about uh uh uh one uh Preacher's Daughter in uh respects how you know he called her and uh she refused to come to the altar met Brum outside and uh really spoke harsh to the prophet that you know I mean I I have my father and my father his religion will keep me and this and that and later he found her or he met her and she she was real bad she became a street woman and I know that but there is a middle of the road amen that is the other side but we are talking this side now where you can hold on for your people you can believe for your people amen he says here in the in that message thy house 61088 now I've got my children there is my little Jo my little son Joseph and Billy Sarah Rebecca well now I want to see each one of them a worker in the gospel doing something I want to see them saved and filled with the Holy Ghost now I've committed them to God and say I'm holding on to God for them see and I believe they are going to be saved every one of them see I believe they are going to be saved I like this part and I'll have them on the other side amen hallelujah I don't believe my salvation will save them no but my faith in God will do it you see my faith believing God will do it and will cause them to come to Christ amen say I'll have them on the other side amen so this is scripture is right there in the Bible amen so God can also remember me and pull my nephews amen remember me do something for a family member or a brother or a sister oh my so brother sister we should never be weary amen keep holding on for each other may God richly bless you [Applause] pass
