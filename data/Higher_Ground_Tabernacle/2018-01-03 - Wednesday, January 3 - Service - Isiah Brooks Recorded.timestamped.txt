[29:11] you in Proverbs but the time cometh when
[29:15] I shall no more speak unto you in
[29:17] Proverbs
[29:18] but I shall show you plainly the father
[29:22] and that day ye shall ask in my name and
[29:27] I say not unto you that I would pray the
[29:30] Father for you for the father himself
[29:33] love with you because you have loved me
[29:36] and have believed it that I came out
[29:39] from God
[29:41] I came forth from the father and them
[29:44] come into the world again I leave the
[29:48] world and I go to the Father his
[29:51] disciples said unto Him lo now speaketh

[30:15] the hour cometh yea is now come
[30:19] that ye shall be scattered every man to
[30:22] his own and shall leave me alone
[30:25] and yet I am NOT alone because the

[30:47] of good cheer because I have overcome
[30:50] the world
[30:51] amen first Corinthians 12 we're gonna
[30:53] read the 13th verse there first
[30:55] Corinthians 12 and 13 God is rich mercy
[31:11] by one spirit are we baptized into one
[31:14] body whether we be Jew or Gentiles
[31:18] whether we be bond or free and have been
[31:22] me and have been all made to drink into
[31:26] one spirit I just love the way he says
[31:28] drink into one spirit let us pray father
[31:31] we thank you for your grace and your
[31:33] mercy we thank you for your goodness
[31:35] hallelujah father you've been gracious
[31:38] to us we thank your father for your
[31:41] mercy Lord and all that you have done
[31:43] for us
[31:43] lord I thank you for how you cleanses us
[31:46] every day every hour of the day we think
[31:49] it for your precious blood Jesus and
[31:51] have been shared for us and we thank you
[31:54] for our hiding place and that is under
[31:57] the shed blood of your dear son Jesus
[31:59] thank you Lord for being so good to us
[32:01] lestor service now in Jesus Christ's
[32:04] name we pray amen you may be seated we
[32:15] were talking about the one bread and
[32:17] being of one body last time i ministered
[32:22] I talked about talked about how Jesus
[32:25] identified as a mature as a harvest who
[32:31] was of God and who wasn't and basically
[32:35] he talked about those who could hear his
[32:37] voice he was telling those who say that
[32:41] they were of Abraham's seed and Abraham
[32:43] was their father that if you were
[32:46] Abraham's seed then you do the works of
[32:48] a preparer because Abraham is my seed
[32:52] and not only that if you would if you
[32:54] knew Abraham then you would do the works
[32:56] and then you would hear my boy
[32:58] because Abraham saw my day and rejoiced
[33:03] in it and before he bruh ham was I am I
[33:07] shared by God's grace how one loaf God
[33:12] always took one loaf even when he was
[33:14] doing communion it was one loaf whatever
[33:17] it was it was one because that oneness
[33:20] that one had to represent him right one
[33:25] all right one father law one Holy Ghost
[33:28] one son of God and these three are one
[33:32] in three different manifestations but
[33:37] there is only one Holy Spirit that Holy
[33:40] Spirit made Jesus holy now Holy Spirit
[33:43] will make you holy right but we realized
[33:46] amen when Jesus said also that man does
[33:49] not live by bread alone but by every
[33:51] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[33:53] God
[33:53] here he's telling his disciples in this
[33:56] particular verse st. John 16 that he
[33:58] proceedeth out of the mouth of God and
[34:01] what was he the word he is the Alpha and
[34:05] the Omega and therefore you and I must
[34:09] if we gonna eat any bread it must be his
[34:12] bread I share with you just the other
[34:15] night amen
[34:16] the only way that you can have eternal
[34:18] life is you gotta feed upon God right
[34:22] that's what he did amen you said what do
[34:25] you mean by that the angel told John you
[34:28] must eat the whole book you must eat the
[34:31] Alpha and the Omega
[34:33] right because Jesus Christ said that man
[34:36] does not live by bread alone and he was
[34:38] working with the natural bread but then
[34:41] he says I am that bread that came down
[34:44] from God down from heaven and here he's
[34:49] basically saying I am is that right
[34:52] the Bible said in the beginning was the
[34:54] word the Word was with God and the Word
[34:56] was God
[34:57] well you know it is God so you and I
[35:01] must understand if God is going to give
[35:04] you eternal life and you were in that
[35:06] eternal life there's only one eternal
[35:08] life so how you gonna get eternal life
[35:11] if you don't feed upon eternal life and
[35:14] eternal life is the word of God
[35:17] hallelujah so man does not live by that
[35:20] bread but by every word that proceedeth
[35:23] out of the mouth of God who is Jesus
[35:26] Christ he is the voice of God he is the
[35:30] god he is the spoken word he is and in
[35:33] order to live we must feed as a prophet
[35:36] of God said on the bloody bleeding
[35:38] were flesh of God is that ok so we
[35:46] realize Amen that our overcoming is only
[35:50] because we are part of the brain I was
[35:53] showing you about communion communion is
[35:56] basically fellowship II right and listen
[36:01] that's why Jesus when he broke the bread
[36:03] he gave you a piece you piece you piece
[36:06] if there were twelve disciples that
[36:08] meant there were twelve pieces of bread
[36:10] nothing was left over because he told a
[36:13] said in one a place he said eat it all
[36:16] up
[36:16] drink it all up right and that drinking
[36:21] is the blood that drinking is the spirit
[36:24] let it saturate you right that bread is
[36:28] given to you because listen bread in the
[36:31] Old Testament it was the vital source of
[36:34] life bread means meant life right it was
[36:39] the source of life so Jesus was saying
[36:41] that the source of life I'm speaking up
[36:44] because remember that well the Jesus
[36:48] understood that the woman thirst he said
[36:52] but I can give you water that you'll
[36:55] never thirst again so he took him from
[36:58] the natural and brought it into the
[37:00] spiritual and even when he speaks he
[37:03] says listen man does not live by bread
[37:05] alone right because Jesus had daughters
[37:08] this is natural bread I can turn it into
[37:11] the stone into bread but it won't give
[37:13] me what I'm looking for it's not he
[37:16] turned a life he said well what do you
[37:18] mean remember it was the word broken in
[37:21] the book of Genesis that took away
[37:24] eternal life or living forever it wasn't
[37:29] natural things that broke it it was a
[37:31] spiritual disobedience which was God's
[37:34] word that they rejected and that was the
[37:37] real source of life hallelujah so when
[37:41] you now understand that's why the Bible
[37:43] says we must not add or take away
[37:46] because remember adding or taken away is
[37:49] allowing
[37:50] give him space for what we call leaven
[37:53] in a loving is anything that will puff
[37:56] it up that's why Amen when you and I
[38:01] come to the communion table when we get
[38:04] ready to take communion we're dealing
[38:06] with in the unleavened bread that's why
[38:09] you and I cannot allow sin to be in our
[38:12] life when we take communion because if
[38:16] there is sin in your life and remember I
[38:18] told you the other day Amen that this
[38:20] what makes it unleavened
[38:23] you 11 is when you identify yourself
[38:27] with the unleavened bread you understand
[38:30] me and therefore you must examine
[38:32] yourself to see whether there be any
[38:35] leavening in your life
[38:37] he kind of unconfessed sin in a kind of
[38:41] attitude any kind of thing that will not
[38:43] make God pure or you pure it must be
[38:48] taken out of you and that's the only way
[38:51] it can come out is by way of confession
[38:54] so now you break yourself to this place
[38:57] and you're saying when you come to
[38:59] communion right he overcame I overcame
[39:02] he is the bread I am the bread right is
[39:07] that right brother Branham said it like
[39:09] this the Holy Ghost came to you you know
[39:12] me he said God rotated a piece of
[39:15] himself off of himself one life but he
[39:21] broke it right there was one pillar fire
[39:25] on the day of Pentecost was 120
[39:28] hallelujah here what was God doing
[39:30] breaking the spiritual bread breaking
[39:33] the spiritual life and therefore giving
[39:36] to each individual hallelujah and God
[39:39] can break himself up in whatever pieces
[39:42] he want to I'll tell you what when John
[39:47] saw his body the Bible said there was a
[39:50] number that no man could number and it
[39:52] still was God one one Holy Spirit one
[39:57] people what fellowship hallelujah in one
[40:01] holy place
[40:04] yeah so even in the breaking of bread he
[40:07] said one of these things you're gonna
[40:08] understand what I'm doing here
[40:10] right he said I'm washing your feet but
[40:12] one of these old days you're gonna
[40:14] understand you sir Peter said I won't
[40:16] wash your feet he said well then you
[40:17] would have no part of it right because
[40:22] in this portion of the bread who is the
[40:24] Lord will humble himself and wash his
[40:29] brother's feet
[40:30] that means forgive him and love him and
[40:33] whatever it takes
[40:35] hallelujah if you can't do that that's
[40:39] it that shows you're not a part of this
[40:43] bread ooh one body one bread and one
[40:51] baptism right and we're born that's oh I
[40:56] love it because you and I cannot receive
[40:59] the Holy Ghost in your soul except you
[41:01] came from God hallelujah because each
[41:06] and every one of us have been
[41:07] predestined leyde you know what that
[41:11] means God has already determined you in
[41:15] he knows he was going to choose him and
[41:18] he was going to choose you he knows a
[41:21] man that this what God is doing it's so
[41:24] powerful and yeah like I said it's so
[41:26] simple really my brother Adam said it's
[41:29] just simple now you can show me anywhere
[41:31] in brother branham's life he chased god
[41:36] no no no no even at his birth God showed
[41:40] up when he was a sinner and care no like
[41:44] he was yes what God showed up hallelujah
[41:47] and I guarantee you you can change your
[41:49] life the same way what are you thinking
[41:53] about God and God showed up ha because
[41:57] when you are predestinated it meant to
[42:00] be bride God will intervene in your life
[42:03] when it's time to turn you and to change
[42:05] you God will turn you and change you
[42:08] right because remember I said unto you
[42:11] just the other night Amen that listen is
[42:14] that context our puzzle you know how
[42:18] yes I mean the big piece big puzzles you
[42:20] don't mind doing the smaller the pieces
[42:22] get the more difficult it becomes right
[42:25] but all of those pieces of that puzzle
[42:28] is necessary to make the picture
[42:31] complete hallelujah and you got to
[42:35] understand there's a beautiful picture
[42:36] on that you might have looked up and say
[42:39] oh I wish I was part of that son piece
[42:41] no but God has colored you a piece of
[42:44] the trunk of a tree hallelujah wherever
[42:48] he cut right brother you are in the
[42:51] picture and I think this is what we fail
[42:54] to see we cannot excommunicate anybody
[42:58] that's part of the picture
[42:59] because if we do that then therefore oh
[43:03] this is wonderful
[43:05] hallelujah understand there are portions
[43:09] of this beautiful picture that has been
[43:12] designed just to be the framework
[43:16] holding everything together
[43:18] hallelujah and there are those postures
[43:22] in this picture I mean there might be
[43:24] more exciting hallelujah but
[43:28] nevertheless each picture each piece of
[43:31] the puzzle is needed and there's nothing
[43:35] like trying to complete a puzzle and the
[43:38] main piece you looking for you can't
[43:40] fire you can't frame a piece
[43:47] you can't frame a puzzle that's not
[43:49] completed that you can but it would
[43:51] always look awkward
[43:54] hallelujah and so you saw old brother
[43:56] roots i'ma tell you something brother
[43:58] Branham gave us a clearer picture of the
[43:59] body of Christ we have divided our lujah
[44:05] and you know the Prophet God said except
[44:06] he said when you say except you believe
[44:08] that not the way I believe he said ooh
[44:10] that's wrong
[44:13] uh-uh come on you're not gonna make it I
[44:17] don't see that in the message except you
[44:19] believe the way I believe Oh No then I
[44:22] know you off-track hallelujah
[44:26] Elijah said Lord there's only me I'm
[44:29] only one here
[44:31] God said not so I have 7,000 that have
[44:35] not been found themselves to debayle
[44:38] hallelujah and because that 7,000 wasn't
[44:41] among Elijah didn't mean that God didn't
[44:45] have him there God is the one who judges
[44:50] the heart and God knows every
[44:53] predestinate is so you have me so I'm
[44:57] gonna ease your conscience God will
[45:00] never give you a thirst for the Holy
[45:01] Ghost or perfection imperfection and the
[45:05] Holy Ghost was not yours because only
[45:09] God can make you thirst and the Bible
[45:12] said whosoever thirst after
[45:14] righteousness they shall be filled
[45:17] hallelujah he didn't say when he said
[45:21] they shall be filled
[45:23] that's the word hallelujah
[45:27] listen but through him we both have
[45:30] access by one spirit unto the father you
[45:35] know we're not like I said the other
[45:36] night
[45:36] when I heard brother Branham say Jesus
[45:38] didn't leave you an inheritance I'm that
[45:41] what he said no he said the father gave
[45:43] you the inheritance hallelujah you
[45:46] listen we might call on the name of
[45:48] Jesus but do you know who comes it's the
[45:53] Holy Ghost and who is the Holy Ghost the
[45:55] father that's why jesus said if you have
[46:00] me the son you have a father and a son
[46:04] [Applause]
[46:05] so you understand by God's grace that
[46:09] God is unveiling himself and we're
[46:11] seeing who Jesus Christ he was the
[46:14] fullness of the Godhead bodily that's
[46:16] what I was trying to tell us he was just
[46:18] a hole
[46:19] he was just a shell hallelujah to
[46:24] manifest the fullness of God but he was
[46:29] the being that God wanted us to see
[46:33] because he said listen if you can see
[46:35] Who I am then you'll come to know who
[46:38] you are
[46:38] oh come on solo you can't have eternal
[46:42] life unless you was with God in the
[46:44] beginning he's
[46:45] eternal life and though we we may not
[46:48] remember all of these things we were
[46:50] with him we were in his bed
[46:52] we were attributes we were part of him
[46:54] when he just existed God didn't say well
[46:58] I would think of these things they were
[46:59] there all these attributes and God saw
[47:07] each and every one of us in our
[47:09] perfection and he will not stop working
[47:13] on the house until you and I are
[47:16] completed oh you may run out of patience
[47:19] and say Lord I don't know why you deal
[47:21] with me gossip but I know hallelujah I
[47:24] can tell you exactly where you were in
[47:27] my mind when I thought of you
[47:32] hallelujah
[47:34] oh my I really got excited today uh-uh
[47:39] uh-uh
[47:39] I won't call him a friend but an
[47:41] associate said when he was early this
[47:44] morning he saw the Sun Rise and he said
[47:48] in the sky it looked like three separate
[47:51] suns rising my daughter saw a
[47:57] supernatural thing this morning I saw it
[48:00] happening but I didn't think no more but
[48:02] I thought wow that's powerful it look
[48:04] like fire was coming up from the earth
[48:06] but I didn't think no more but I went on
[48:08] about my business I said well Lord you
[48:09] know but when he showed three sergeant
[48:12] and this man I started smelling I got
[48:14] happy on the inside
[48:16] I said yes Lord I believe it's your time
[48:21] hallelujah and they said well is because
[48:24] of the water vapors and the crystal
[48:26] things and hey I don't care what is from
[48:28] God did it he paints it the way he won't
[48:32] the payment hallelujah my son a rainbow
[48:38] on the side and a rainbow on that side
[48:40] and then in the Sun was a big kind of
[48:43] fire type and yet in it was a dark spot
[48:45] right and all of a sudden the Sun broke
[48:47] through it sound like a resurrection to
[48:50] me hallelujah a covenant of the Old
[48:53] Testament our Covenant to the New
[48:55] Testament and then here come the Sun
[48:58] through the darkness hallelujah
[49:02] it's real my soul even though I didn't
[49:05] see it
[49:06] hallelujah now therefore ye are no more
[49:10] strangers foreigners but fellow-citizens
[49:12] with the Saints and oh I love that the
[49:16] household of God that's it right the
[49:19] whole house of God hallelujah and are
[49:24] built upon the foundation of the
[49:26] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[49:28] Himself being the chief Cornerstone oh
[49:32] don't you see what I'm saying because in
[49:35] this age we are the only ones that have
[49:38] been able to receive that the capping of
[49:42] the pyramid the very cheap cornerstone
[49:47] hallelujah the very finished work of God
[49:50] comes down into us no like a rocket we
[49:55] take up and that's how that fire looked
[49:58] this morning when we saw it would go
[50:00] like this
[50:01] right brother I didn't know what it was
[50:05] I really didn't know or if I had known
[50:08] how to weigh that you see I knew it was
[50:11] the Sun but I didn't understand what was
[50:12] causing that anyway let's go on so the
[50:15] moon as beautiful as it was oh my god
[50:21] and I built upon the foundation of the
[50:24] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[50:26] Himself being the chief Cornerstone
[50:27] in whom all the building fitly framed
[50:30] together groweth unto a holy temple of
[50:33] the Lord well growing we all are growing
[50:39] in whom he also a built
[50:42] I like this together now separated built
[50:48] together for habitation of God through
[50:56] the spirit huh so what's happening now
[51:00] I've got a little note here since
[51:02] judging our hearts a judge our hearts
[51:04] see but them says I am a Pentecostal
[51:07] Nazarene Baptist so that's the way we
[51:10] are
[51:10] we're just represent
[51:12] the Lord Jesus Christ in His mercy
[51:13] that's right for by one spirit are we
[51:16] baptized into the body becomes one
[51:19] people right that's what Jesus was
[51:23] saying and remember now this is one of
[51:27] the reasons why Judas could not go to
[51:30] Pentecost because he wasn't part of the
[51:32] body and just when God was gonna do some
[51:36] great God dismiss him and say go do what
[51:39] you got to do what did God do he got rid
[51:42] of the leavening a little people don't
[51:48] understand what God is doing he's
[51:50] getting rid of the Lebanon oh don't tell
[51:59] see he told those seventy he owes his
[52:03] disciples except you eat my flesh and
[52:05] drink my blood you shall have no part of
[52:08] no life in you what happened they left
[52:11] he was deliberately getting rid of the
[52:14] Lebanon y'all hear what I'm saying and
[52:17] that's the way it is right now
[52:19] hallelujah God is deliberately getting
[52:22] rid of the Lebanon ah
[52:26] because you see what's happening with
[52:29] the bride of Jesus Christ she's going to
[52:31] eat every bit of it
[52:34] she won't all the world hallelujah for
[52:38] example can I use it like this if
[52:41] somebody say well hey you you want your
[52:43] husband with both of his rounds of wine
[52:47] y'all understand me
[52:49] that's no charge to me I want my husband
[52:53] about you know another woman I want my
[52:55] wife I wanted to do this see I don't
[53:00] want pie I don't want to Jesus with one
[53:02] foot one eye or whatever the case may be
[53:07] I want it for statue Alleluia in me
[53:11] right and that's why Jesus said listen
[53:14] if your arm your I would ever fin you
[53:16] cut it off your leash you enter into the
[53:20] kingdom maybe
[53:23] maybe but you at the end of the bed
[53:25] while she walked through that door you
[53:26] fool you complete but at least you get
[53:29] in there what was he saying if there be
[53:31] 11 whether it be your are you up you
[53:34] don't mean you go and plug your eye on
[53:35] he's speaking spiritually here right the
[53:40] seriousness of this body part is that
[53:42] you can see that how detrimental these
[53:44] things can be to you if right you got to
[53:47] make a decision
[53:47] that means if I got to go in name I'd
[53:50] rather go in Lane than to be whole and
[53:53] left behind and that makes sense I think
[54:03] if I say this because I don't listen I
[54:05] want everybody to know listen you didn't
[54:07] come here tonight and then for some
[54:10] entertainment you came because there's a
[54:13] part of you that's keep pulling is the
[54:14] part of you that love God's word
[54:16] hallelujah
[54:17] and let me tell you like this I love it
[54:19] because I couldn't get rid of him if I
[54:21] wanted to yeah he what I'm saying I
[54:25] can't get rid of him but he can get rid
[54:27] of me but he can't get rid of me why no
[54:31] more than Abraham could get rid of Sarah
[54:33] no more than Adam could get rid of me
[54:36] this is what this is the bride that
[54:38] loves him that he's foresaw in his mind
[54:41] that would take every word above all
[54:44] these worldly things we've made pause
[54:47] and I know the word but how to perform
[54:50] it is where I'm having problems but at
[54:53] the end of the day anything about your
[54:55] performance is his performance must
[54:59] remain grace it must remain grace only
[55:04] way we can perform it is because of His
[55:06] grace
[55:11] hallelujah first community services
[55:14] number one spirit how does that spirit
[55:16] come through the sacrifice where did the
[55:19] spirit lay within the blood why couldn't
[55:22] he have a comeback it was an animal
[55:24] hallelujah
[55:25] wait a minute somebody ought to help me
[55:27] here why didn't they handle my blood
[55:29] come on us when Jesus he was an animal
[55:32] y'all scared to see that in it he was
[55:34] part animal
[55:38] God had to make him in this flesh in the
[55:44] image of an animal but God wasn't
[55:48] working with that there was a life that
[55:50] was behind that natural man that
[55:55] produced a spiritual party hello if the
[56:01] natural man can produce a natural body
[56:03] the spiritual body has to produce a
[56:05] spiritual body and we call it the
[56:07] glorified that's where the blood takes
[56:10] us to a complete adoption so much so
[56:13] we're changed from this model to
[56:16] immortality the first atom was made and
[56:19] created out like I'm like buddy
[56:21] verbatim says here's like feet like a
[56:23] monkey how he said it I was like a bear
[56:25] and he goes on like that he was all too
[56:27] touchy to feel and they communicate with
[56:29] this world hallelujah
[56:32] and the second atom what he gave in us
[56:35] was not only a theophany but he comes he
[56:36] brings us a a glorified body
[56:41] we'll be able to walk through walls if
[56:44] there be in here whatever y'all
[56:46] understand me if I said just like the
[56:49] natural man the image the natural man
[56:51] produced the image of a natural man he
[56:53] said just like the spiritual Adam which
[56:55] will produce a heavenly body a spiritual
[56:57] body and that's where we are
[57:02] hallelujah that's what the property God
[57:05] was trying to tell us we are our
[57:08] inheritance is of Elohim God accept
[57:17] existing one whatever then you were
[57:20] Jehovah Jireh and they're all of them
[57:22] this is where our inheritance come from
[57:26] you understand me
[57:28] we are it's the only difference is that
[57:32] God gave us a body after after Jesus
[57:34] y'all know what I'm saying
[57:37] but in those spirit in that Holy Ghost
[57:40] we're just a piece of God I don't know
[57:44] how else to say it and God call it a son
[57:47] if you and I don't get these things
[57:50] not hard in our minds how you gonna go
[57:52] to where you're going faith comes by
[57:54] hearing hearing by the Word of God right
[57:57] now you can't stand back and say well
[57:59] I'm Elohim no he's our him in him we
[58:05] existed you see all thing consists of
[58:14] him so that means there's nothing on the
[58:17] outside of him everything is in there is
[58:22] no space outside of God he feels
[58:24] everything yeah in the same time for the
[58:29] velum said as he is a mishit he said
[58:34] he's a person but he cannot be
[58:36] everywhere at the same time but because
[58:39] of his knowledge in his understanding he
[58:46] explained that with anybody better take
[58:49] it by faith and move on our little
[58:53] brains can't even comprehend their hmm
[58:57] all we know is this thing locked up in
[58:59] here it ain't a lot of room in there
[59:02] either
[59:03] you know I'm saying mine anyway let's
[59:06] move on by God's grace y'all understand
[59:08] what I'm going see we have to be careful
[59:11] and it is true we have been taught
[59:13] whether we realize it or not and in
[59:15] saints of God when God saved me honestly
[59:19] I was in a Baptist Church yes I would
[59:23] whether you know that or not when God
[59:26] saved me and I gave my heart to the Lord
[59:28] I was at 12 years old a Baptist Church
[59:31] and nobody can tell me otherwise
[59:33] we've got saved brother Branham where
[59:35] was he he wasn't in a Pentecostal church
[59:37] he was in the baptist but came to a
[59:40] Baptist Church God could have took him
[59:42] somewhere else he said but in that he
[59:45] learned he thought he thought one time
[59:47] that if you were in the Baptist you
[59:48] ain't got it and then he met these
[59:51] Pentecostals who had more than a Baptist
[59:54] so he learned he learned but a buck
[59:57] takes wherever but Len said that even an
[59:59] eagle can hatch I mean a a chicken
[1:00:03] Hatcher Eagle producing the right
[1:00:06] temperature
[1:00:07] oh that a hallelujah you can be born in
[1:00:13] the streets a lot of people was born in
[1:00:16] car over manure piles in the barns
[1:00:21] y'all hit me it's wherever they now to
[1:00:24] meet God is where God met them but we
[1:00:30] don't remain there
[1:00:31] that's just justification hallelujah and
[1:00:35] this is what I love about the Holy
[1:00:37] Spirit he will draw you but you can't
[1:00:41] move out of those churches if God don't
[1:00:43] draw you and my point is why would God
[1:00:53] said come out of her my people if he
[1:00:55] didn't have people still in there there
[1:00:59] may come a day that all God's people
[1:01:01] that out I'm talking about bride now
[1:01:04] right but until that day we can't this
[1:01:08] fellowship o Lord ourselves from people
[1:01:11] because they believe differently and
[1:01:13] that's where he says he called a
[1:01:17] colonization didn't colonized put walls
[1:01:23] around ourselves hallelujah I marvel at
[1:01:29] the prophet of God because there was a
[1:01:31] time he was at a me Macpherson's blessed
[1:01:35] her gravesite hello talk about how she
[1:01:38] was a wonderful pioneer and he knew the
[1:01:44] word
[1:01:47] I heard him call as this lady was up in
[1:01:49] the prayer line don't get me wrong folks
[1:01:50] I don't know what God is doing but be
[1:01:52] careful because you don't know the next
[1:01:55] step or the next place that person might
[1:01:57] be because they here today don't mean
[1:02:01] they they're not gonna go Father
[1:02:03] yeah and I'm saying how do we judge we
[1:02:06] look at the Holy Ghost by one spirit
[1:02:12] hallelujah don't get me wrong brother
[1:02:14] bellum blob eighty Bisco but any biscuit
[1:02:17] didn't get baptized in the name of the
[1:02:19] Lord Jesus Christ until after brother
[1:02:21] Branham was gone but he was a brother
[1:02:28] I'm not saying you got a walk exactly
[1:02:31] with them and do what they do but I just
[1:02:34] don't be Christianized people I had a
[1:02:40] wonderful experience today when I bought
[1:02:43] my car
[1:02:44] I witnessed to this young man he's of
[1:02:47] Spanish orient and I told her I said
[1:02:50] well down a road we'd get together and
[1:02:52] we have dinner on lunch together didn't
[1:02:55] know that his parents his grandparents
[1:02:57] his parents his gram waist up in the
[1:02:58] church all his life but he backs me and
[1:03:03] he said the other day when I call him he
[1:03:05] said I just whatever he said they get
[1:03:10] excited when I talk about church because
[1:03:12] they know I he said I was just telling
[1:03:14] them that you and I had planned on lunch
[1:03:16] or dinner he said in the phone way he
[1:03:20] said that was that was kind of strange
[1:03:22] that you call it the time I was talking
[1:03:24] about you he plans to come here I was so
[1:03:30] shocked he don't look up our church he
[1:03:33] know what we stand for every day he done
[1:03:35] searched me out tell you what I'm saying
[1:03:39] something is stirring in this young
[1:03:41] man's heart and God somehow made the
[1:03:45] connection it was powerful you know he
[1:03:52] talked about God I think more than I did
[1:03:54] today it was wonderful to know that God
[1:03:59] is making
[1:04:00] I've been praying I need help god help
[1:04:05] me I can't do all this by myself
[1:04:09] not talking that later but anyway cane
[1:04:12] religiously and a worshiper of God
[1:04:14] walked over and laid down his sacrifice
[1:04:17] got back and said Lord receive my
[1:04:19] sacrifice all this I have done and you
[1:04:22] know my regards to you and my faith in
[1:04:25] you look what a religious man he was
[1:04:27] Lord I built you a church and I paid
[1:04:30] into it and I pay hear me on the plate
[1:04:34] and I worship you everyday with the
[1:04:37] sincerity integrity of my heart you know
[1:04:39] me and I worship you and God refused him
[1:04:46] now if God only respected membership or
[1:04:50] just a person looking in the face of God
[1:04:53] and worshiping if God respects that and
[1:04:57] that is his requirement then he would be
[1:05:00] unjust to condemn king after Cain had
[1:05:04] done all of that that's exactly right
[1:05:06] but the scripture says there is a way
[1:05:09] that seemeth right unto man but the end
[1:05:11] thereof is the way of death so be
[1:05:15] careful Church why are you in this last
[1:05:18] days and things are floating and being
[1:05:21] these spirits are coming to the head and
[1:05:23] the wheat and the barley and the vines
[1:05:26] and everything are coming to a head
[1:05:28] don'tjump see it Israel is coming to a
[1:05:32] head and if Israel we who is the barley
[1:05:36] and we are the wheat we're coming to a
[1:05:39] head this thing is running out and I
[1:05:43] wouldn't want to be caught not willfully
[1:05:46] obey are disobeying the Word of God
[1:05:48] they're gonna be number or numbers of
[1:05:51] people who are saying but they got to go
[1:05:54] through the tribulation period because
[1:05:56] they fail to be obedient right I heard
[1:05:59] someone not long ago condemning the
[1:06:02] Lutheran age and condemning the Wesleyan
[1:06:04] age
[1:06:05] he said that was divine just the same as
[1:06:08] the church is today but the thing of it
[1:06:11] was they were only put forth Lee
[1:06:14] there is putting forth fruit now the
[1:06:18] vine is grown up the same charge and
[1:06:21] then well was old leaves is still left
[1:06:24] leaves but if it makes by sea like the
[1:06:28] week coming up among the weeds and the
[1:06:31] week put forth hits see the week put
[1:06:34] forth his fruit and the wheeze put forth
[1:06:36] of his fruit we're at the end time we're
[1:06:39] at the last day
[1:06:42] hallelujah and let me tell you something
[1:06:44] a desire I love this because a desire to
[1:06:47] be perfect by Christ knowing that the
[1:06:50] only way that you can do it or can be
[1:06:52] done you must depend upon him hallelujah
[1:06:56] he said I am the vine and you are
[1:06:58] branches hallelujah when he said I
[1:07:02] brother Brooks how do I come to
[1:07:04] perfection yield yield yield right
[1:07:07] because you know a men when they get
[1:07:09] though bushes of apples or grapes or one
[1:07:12] they said this that tree yielded more
[1:07:14] food fruit see the fruit was already in
[1:07:18] it
[1:07:18] hallelujah but it gave way to the
[1:07:23] manifestation of the fruit the Holy
[1:07:26] Ghost which is Christ in you is in you
[1:07:29] and every perfect gift comes so the Holy
[1:07:33] Ghost is perfectly perfect in you and it
[1:07:36] can bring for perfect character if you
[1:07:40] hear to it is this okay so I want you to
[1:07:49] see by God's grace you know as at the
[1:07:52] scripture we were talking about how did
[1:07:54] the children of Israel they you know are
[1:07:56] sawing and they said one to another it
[1:07:59] is a manna and they wish not what it was
[1:08:01] and Moses said unto them this is the
[1:08:04] bread which the Lord has given it to you
[1:08:06] to eat this is the thing that the Lord
[1:08:08] had commanded commanded gather up it
[1:08:12] every man according to his eating and
[1:08:14] Omar for every man according to the
[1:08:17] number of your persons taking every man
[1:08:19] for them which are in his tents and the
[1:08:22] children of Israel did so and gather
[1:08:24] some more and some less and when they
[1:08:26] did meet
[1:08:28] it was a NOLA he that gathered much had
[1:08:31] nothing over and he that gathered little
[1:08:33] had no life they gathered every man
[1:08:35] according to his eating and moses said
[1:08:38] let no man leave it leave of it till the
[1:08:41] morning in other words there are some
[1:08:44] people a man who eats a lot they've
[1:08:46] fully studied and and that it just feels
[1:08:49] enough and then there who doesn't
[1:08:50] require as much and it feels it but
[1:08:53] whatever they eat they're not supposed
[1:08:56] to leave it till tomorrow that means you
[1:08:58] must have daily bread teach us how to
[1:09:03] pray give us this day our daily bread
[1:09:06] see Jesus couldn't do no different
[1:09:08] anybody commanded them to do in the Old
[1:09:10] Testament you understand me so that
[1:09:14] means when you don't read a study every
[1:09:17] day you're breaking the word because it
[1:09:21] must be daily you the one that would get
[1:09:26] weak God never gets weak but you will
[1:09:32] become weak because you're not feeding
[1:09:34] on his word
[1:09:35] you saw brothers I don't know where to
[1:09:38] start
[1:09:38] God listens he you can talk to him and
[1:09:43] he'll tell you exactly where to go just
[1:09:46] for your daily bread some of us are not
[1:09:51] great readers huh and God knows that all
[1:09:56] you got to do is say Lord just show me
[1:09:58] something give me something for the day
[1:10:01] he'll do it hallelujah give us our daily
[1:10:08] bread and forgive us our debts as we
[1:10:10] forgive our debt toss see give us our
[1:10:13] daily bread but don't forget to forgive
[1:10:14] your brothers and your sisters because
[1:10:16] if you don't do that this bread won't do
[1:10:18] you no good God will not work over
[1:10:23] unforgiveness hello you got a problem
[1:10:28] with forgiveness you know we all do I
[1:10:31] was telling somebody the other day it
[1:10:33] took me three years to get a brother for
[1:10:37] what he did he said three years oh I did
[1:10:42] I would say Lord I forgive them Lord I
[1:10:44] forgive them Lord I forgive them please
[1:10:46] help me Lord but that's what I'm trying
[1:10:48] to say I said please help me see because
[1:10:50] I'm gonna tell you something some of us
[1:10:52] might not want to acknowledge it but
[1:10:54] when you feel those funny feelings about
[1:10:56] people that supposed to be okay with you
[1:10:59] that's unforgiveness God's warning you
[1:11:02] that there's something unpure in you and
[1:11:08] sometimes we show we think his
[1:11:09] discernment that that other brother or
[1:11:11] that other sisters wrong huh
[1:11:13] that's dig deep and see where the error
[1:11:17] is I did
[1:11:27] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:11:29] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:11:31] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:11:32] and the blood of the Lord and let me say
[1:11:34] like this god no I was telling the
[1:11:39] brother the other day I said you know
[1:11:40] what the Bible said if you have the will
[1:11:42] to do God has already counted in each
[1:11:45] other because he know eventually it get
[1:11:51] it will is going to happen oh you say
[1:11:53] well if I die like this if you die like
[1:11:56] that God then call it already done
[1:11:58] that's the scripture if there is a will
[1:12:01] to do God look it up God is already
[1:12:04] counting down but there must be a will
[1:12:08] to overcome it the reason why I was able
[1:12:14] to overcome cuz I don't like to be in
[1:12:16] bondage I don't like nobody controlling
[1:12:20] me the only person I want controlling me
[1:12:23] is God nobody but him we must examine
[1:12:31] ourselves hello
[1:12:35] whether whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:12:37] see you gotta understand I don't know
[1:12:40] your heart and I could only preach what
[1:12:43] he's telling me to preach but I know God
[1:12:47] is in this my thing is I'm just sayin
[1:12:51] examine yourself it's good to say it's
[1:12:54] to see whether you be in the face is
[1:13:01] this okay drinky all of it I love this
[1:13:07] you know I'm trying to come to a close
[1:13:10] and I just got a few more because I want
[1:13:13] you to realize by God's grace that if
[1:13:15] you and I are not constantly filled with
[1:13:18] this Holy Spirit we're going to come up
[1:13:21] short what happened
[1:13:23] because then you began to drink like you
[1:13:25] began to think like a carnal mind the
[1:13:29] Holy Spirit keeps you in the mind of God
[1:13:35] is that right oh come on we looked at it
[1:13:38] this way when you are drunk
[1:13:41] let's say offline whose mine you have
[1:13:44] been it ain't yours
[1:13:47] it's whatever spirit or not at you and
[1:13:52] when you drunk all the holy ghost whose
[1:13:55] mine do you have exactly you say things
[1:14:00] that you didn't knew didn't have no
[1:14:02] intention to say sometimes we prophesy
[1:14:05] didn't even know we were prophesy your
[1:14:08] blessed people you never curse you bless
[1:14:11] him that's blessed blessed blessed
[1:14:12] because about said blessed and cursed
[1:14:14] aha see here you good you're drunk you
[1:14:19] know and I love drunk folks now
[1:14:21] understand me that the scenario of it
[1:14:25] because when they're drunk of real wine
[1:14:27] there is no prejudice among them you can
[1:14:31] smell like a coup and that drunker to
[1:14:34] drink that both in here you won't
[1:14:36] and they didn't criticize you if you
[1:14:38] don't want any y'all remember the day
[1:14:44] it's real and that's how it is when it
[1:14:48] comes to spiritually being drunk you
[1:14:50] want everybody to feel what you feeling
[1:14:53] you want him to have that joy y'all know
[1:14:56] what I'm saying
[1:14:56] call Holly nothing listen that's how
[1:14:58] come a lot of drunks and then they die
[1:15:00] Nicole because they're so hot they can't
[1:15:04] even feel the cold weather some of them
[1:15:12] I don't know about all over this
[1:15:14] somebody truckin can feel it I'm just
[1:15:17] saying but you know that that alcohol in
[1:15:19] their body they don't feel how cold it
[1:15:21] really is yes that's what I better say
[1:15:25] it that way listen oh man I love the
[1:15:33] Lord God is perfect in all this way
[1:15:37] listen and he took the cup and gave
[1:15:40] thanks and gave it to them saying drink
[1:15:43] ye all of it I look at people day I try
[1:15:49] - I don't do it no more cause it
[1:15:50] discourages me when people don't taking
[1:15:52] the wine company going didn't really get
[1:15:57] any I had a sister there and in Lima you
[1:16:04] almost had to put her ass at the end of
[1:16:06] the line because she took whatever there
[1:16:08] I don't know how she did and I was I
[1:16:13] really wanted she said that's right she
[1:16:15] said I take the best piece of bread and
[1:16:17] I take the biggest gulp I can because
[1:16:19] I'm it represents Christ and I won't all
[1:16:23] and from then on I'd be taking y'all she
[1:16:26] betray I try to drink as much as my
[1:16:28] mouth and I tear the brand up when
[1:16:31] nobody else want the rest of it I failed
[1:16:33] to leave it that's what I'm thinking in
[1:16:37] my mind when I do communion I'm thinking
[1:16:40] God I won't as much as you could keep me
[1:16:44] who be sippin off of it and that's all I
[1:16:48] get in it spiritual life just the sale
[1:16:50] you know people are messed up in their
[1:16:54] mind you know they can trust these
[1:16:57] restaurants with their food and drink
[1:17:00] and then when it comes to the cup don't
[1:17:05] make sense to me you don't know what
[1:17:11] those people in that restaurant doing
[1:17:13] you trust them more than you do the cup
[1:17:16] of God that's why I said we're not
[1:17:21] wiping that glass we're wiping germs
[1:17:23] we're just making it you know wet dry
[1:17:26] that's it we don't have to do that but I
[1:17:29] know some people can't take it any way
[1:17:31] that's gone this is my blood of the
[1:17:34] New Testament
[1:17:35] you know that new tested that word
[1:17:37] Testament means wheel this is my law
[1:17:39] this is my wheel which is to share which
[1:17:42] is was shed for the remission of sin mmm
[1:17:45] hallelujah so it is God's will to
[1:17:49] multiply ooh that's what his will was
[1:17:55] the first thing he said to Adam and Eve
[1:17:57] he said beat multiply replenish the
[1:18:00] earth
[1:18:00] that was his will they have
[1:18:02] more of him oh and the only way he could
[1:18:08] have lured him was the shed his blood so
[1:18:12] that life that bypassed us because of
[1:18:14] sin could come back to us his wheel is
[1:18:20] faster be perfect that's what he said be
[1:18:23] perfect as your father which is in
[1:18:25] heaven is perfect
[1:18:27] the prophet god said the only way that
[1:18:29] that could be done God himself had to
[1:18:32] make a way for us to be perfect you go
[1:18:36] out the daughter your will all of us all
[1:18:39] the time every day we hear Jesus said
[1:18:44] Lord not my will but thine be done
[1:18:46] he wasn't just saying that he was
[1:18:48] fighting battling with his with his
[1:18:52] humanity and yet you listen I'm gonna
[1:18:56] tell you something if you think and this
[1:18:58] is what I want you to understand I want
[1:19:00] everybody to understand that every
[1:19:02] Christian when you become a Christian
[1:19:03] you have signed up not just for the
[1:19:06] allow me of the Lord but you have signed
[1:19:08] up to go to the battlefield immediately
[1:19:13] you arm yourself to war every day don't
[1:19:16] you think you go get some kind of
[1:19:18] vacation a break not in this one I don't

[1:19:39] years old I said like that before the
[1:19:41] foundation of the world um you want to
[1:19:42] go there but my point is I've battled
[1:19:45] all my life hallelujah
[1:19:50] there were times I even went AWOL but
[1:19:58] you know when you're in the Army of God
[1:20:00] God go send somebody for you he gonna
[1:20:05] arrest you you'll be in prison for a
[1:20:08] while but by the time he's done with you
[1:20:11] you be ready to fight
[1:20:17] God won't lose one I like it the way
[1:20:23] Jesse said it the other death egg was
[1:20:24] Jesse he said in the midst of the battle
[1:20:28] no that was that brother brother
[1:20:30] Maryland Sunday night in the midst of
[1:20:32] the battle he is is David taking a a
[1:20:38] window break looking through the window
[1:20:42] Yahoo was that no that was our brother
[1:20:44] brother Troy I remember the word I just
[1:20:46] couldn't remember who was saying it and
[1:20:48] that they stopped with me I said we
[1:20:50] spend more time looking through the
[1:20:52] window then we do fighting and battling
[1:20:55] for god this thing is of the devil we
[1:21:01] you know we use it for God but if you
[1:21:04] know if you're not the controller of
[1:21:06] this thing it will control you
[1:21:09] it will command you and dictate to you
[1:21:13] it becomes your Bathsheba yes sir
[1:21:22] I said that's right iPhones iPads and uh
[1:21:26] everything ah everything it's the truth
[1:21:37] listen I'm closing on these thoughts you
[1:21:40] and I and let me tell you something what
[1:21:42] brother Adam said he says when a man has
[1:21:45] the ball we supposed to rally about the
[1:21:48] law the man with the ball we're not
[1:21:50] supposed to want to take the ball from
[1:21:52] the man and we're not supposed to want
[1:21:55] to do something different you understand
[1:21:57] what I'm saying I'm going with the
[1:21:59] pastor's vision I have been here 11
[1:22:01] years and I still have yet to see a full
[1:22:05] response with the pastor on his vision
[1:22:09] it just seems like everybody going their
[1:22:11] own little way and and that's that's
[1:22:14] that's why you have all that aha
[1:22:16] church hopping because the everybody
[1:22:18] said where the Lord led me and the Lord
[1:22:19] lead me and you know I talked with a
[1:22:21] brother who who's from Jesse church and
[1:22:24] the brother him in the church a long
[1:22:26] time with a lolly dingly to visit
[1:22:30] and here's your pastor suffering because
[1:22:32] you are not taking the vision that God
[1:22:35] is he can go little further he can if
[1:22:39] you're not gonna follow behind his
[1:22:41] vision his work here is in vain now he's
[1:22:46] running he and his wife all over the
[1:22:48] place
[1:22:48] amen and Jesse's there needing him and
[1:22:52] that's what we find it in this place
[1:22:54] there may have been some people telling
[1:22:56] me they weren't gonna come Sunday night
[1:22:58] but I said oh my god I I mean you know
[1:23:00] what I'm saying it was it was
[1:23:02] embarrassing that this church was full
[1:23:04] of Iowa City and only a few people from
[1:23:09] Des Moines now I don't know about you
[1:23:11] and I jumped with my saw but I'm gonna
[1:23:14] finish it
[1:23:14] I don't know about you but I would feel
[1:23:16] pretty bad if I was from Iowa City cuz
[1:23:19] nobody ever goes down there but they
[1:23:21] make the sacrifice to come up here and
[1:23:23] then when they do make the sacrifice to
[1:23:25] come up here the people that goes to
[1:23:27] this church disappears then I sent him
[1:23:30] some bad advice so I made a plan told me
[1:23:38] but my point is this there are those
[1:23:39] who've never called never texts never
[1:23:41] did anything and didn't even show up and
[1:23:44] I was very very disappointed
[1:23:46] I had a battle of my lifetime and on top
[1:23:51] of that you no longer took don't text me
[1:23:54] the very a few hours or so before
[1:23:56] getting here he's not coming
[1:23:58] so when he's not coming that mean his
[1:24:00] group is not coming but it's okay
[1:24:02] the Holy Ghost showed up and my thing is
[1:24:06] this there was such a unity in this
[1:24:08] place oh it felt good and when the Lord
[1:24:11] came down through that song it was
[1:24:13] awesome y'all understand me and I look
[1:24:16] at this thing and I said lord have mercy
[1:24:18] you know it was so funny it happened the
[1:24:20] way it did because I had just went down
[1:24:21] there Friday
[1:24:22] spoke to them on this suddenly similar
[1:24:25] to this and I told my said Iowa people
[1:24:28] are different I said when I was in Ohio
[1:24:30] I said these people would even travel
[1:24:32] with me even from state to state I said
[1:24:34] but I'm not asking for state to state I
[1:24:36] said even when I came here I said I came
[1:24:38] in so well anybody need rides will help
[1:24:41] you can go with us we're glad for you
[1:24:43] know
[1:24:44] body yet I wish everybody was here
[1:24:46] tonight I will live I will encourage him
[1:24:49] to take this message and I'm gonna
[1:24:50] encourage them also to listen to the
[1:24:53] last portion because my point is I'm a
[1:24:56] recent scripture here in just a minute
[1:24:57] to back up what I'm saying if we are
[1:25:00] bribed we've got to have one head and
[1:25:01] one hand over the head but Jesus Christ
[1:25:05] is the head of this church brother
[1:25:08] Brooks is the pastor who's the head of
[1:25:10] the church local right you know I was so
[1:25:15] blessed when Pilate and brother Colley
[1:25:19] weekend when y'all came in as cold as it
[1:25:21] was and ice is the road that goes down
[1:25:23] your Road I'm like Oh Lord a real rebuke
[1:25:26] I'm glad you did too
[1:25:28] it made my night yes you know and my
[1:25:33] thing is this you know the scripture
[1:25:34] tells us that you know let me read
[1:25:37] something just first Chronicles 12 38
[1:25:39] through 40 says all these men of war
[1:25:42] that could keep rank came with the
[1:25:45] perfect hard to heed room to make David
[1:25:47] over all Israel and all the rest also of
[1:25:52] Israel were of one heart to make David
[1:25:55] King and they went out with they were
[1:25:59] with David three days eating and
[1:26:01] drinking for their brethren had prepared
[1:26:04] for them now you got to understand this
[1:26:06] is a type of the Millennium this is the
[1:26:09] type of the wedding supper because they
[1:26:11] come to crown here King right and when
[1:26:14] we go to crown him King three years
[1:26:17] really have it's just three days so and
[1:26:20] they were listen what they were doing
[1:26:21] and they were with David three days
[1:26:24] eating and drinking for their brethren
[1:26:25] had prepared for them moreover they that
[1:26:28] were nigh them even unto in Sakhalin
[1:26:31] simulant and Ethel I brought bread on
[1:26:34] asses and cameras and amuse and own
[1:26:36] auxins and meat and meal and cakes of
[1:26:39] peas and bunches of raisins and wine and
[1:26:41] oil and oxen and sheep abundantly but
[1:26:46] there was joy in Israel hallelujah but
[1:26:50] what is it they came with one heart
[1:26:53] I'm not telling people to come make me
[1:26:56] king but I will
[1:26:58] I want to see God King whether it be in
[1:27:02] Des Moines Iowa City with one body and
[1:27:05] that's what I want to see that's what
[1:27:07] I've been called for I did not come here
[1:27:10] to play Church you understand me
[1:27:18] this is on my heart and I'm gonna say it
[1:27:20] just like he wants me to said I just
[1:27:21] wish everybody was here they're people
[1:27:25] that leaves charge go anywhere they want
[1:27:28] to go and don't never call me never say
[1:27:30] anything and and this is what I'm saying
[1:27:32] you see well who are you brother works I
[1:27:34] came making nothing but you know what
[1:27:36] there's a word called RESP ECT and
[1:27:39] that's respect you ain't gonna be in
[1:27:44] somebody else's army what sergeant I
[1:27:46] just thought I'd go to the restroom I
[1:27:48] didn't mean it that way brother but my
[1:27:51] heel because he does go to the restroom
[1:27:53] but my that ain't the point my point is
[1:27:55] you got to say sure sir yes sir can you
[1:28:00] go can I be excused or whatever and he's
[1:28:02] got to respond yes or no that's the
[1:28:06] natural army I would never try to stop
[1:28:09] anybody from doing whatever they want to
[1:28:11] do but this is a respect of somebody
[1:28:14] saying brother Brooks I'm not gonna be
[1:28:15] here and then I won't be able for you
[1:28:18] that was our I see guys my thoughts what
[1:28:22] good did they get an accident well I'm a
[1:28:29] watchman that means i watch everything
[1:28:33] now the holy spirit moves right away
[1:28:36] from the Pentecostal age what did they
[1:28:38] do they organised made themselves we are
[1:28:41] an assembly of god we are oneness we are
[1:28:43] two years we are Church of God we are
[1:28:45] this or that you don't belong you you
[1:28:48] can't get into heaven unless you got
[1:28:50] your name on our books oh such nonsense
[1:28:54] I don't care if you are Baptist
[1:28:56] Methodist Presbyterian you put your name
[1:28:59] on the book of life when God puts it on
[1:29:01] day oh did he do it and when did he do
[1:29:06] it before the foundation of the world
[1:29:09] Oh Lord I got saved today hello
[1:29:11] you just acknowledged your salvation
[1:29:13] today god save you in the mind in the
[1:29:18] line right I don't care if you're
[1:29:21] Baptist Methodist resident you put your
[1:29:23] name on the book of life when God puts
[1:29:25] it on there if you were a predestinated
[1:29:29] to eternal life God will call you some
[1:29:32] way somehow some way or other he sure
[1:29:36] will all the father has given me will
[1:29:39] count no matter what church you belong
[1:29:41] to that has nothing to do with it but
[1:29:44] the denominations will never do one
[1:29:47] thing to you but light can do you a lot
[1:29:50] from going on with God that's all I can
[1:29:53] do him to you that'll never do nothing
[1:29:56] else congregation you get together with
[1:29:59] a bunch of believers and unbelievers of
[1:30:01] course you hit that everywhere you go
[1:30:04] and they even had it in heaven so it's
[1:30:07] alright but you're looking to your
[1:30:09] denomination look to Jesus he's the one
[1:30:12] to look to that okay let me read this
[1:30:16] one more screw the scripture here that I
[1:30:18] overlooked the Bible says and I showed
[1:30:22] you there in David how they wouldn't
[1:30:24] break ring-ring right all these men a
[1:30:27] war that could keep rank hello
[1:30:32] whatever position God put you in that's
[1:30:34] where you stay so they shall run then
[1:30:39] this is Joelle 2:7 they shall run like
[1:30:42] mighty men they should climb the wall
[1:30:45] like men of war and they shall march
[1:30:48] everyone on his ways and they shall not
[1:30:51] break their ranks you know that's why
[1:30:54] I'm so happy tonight because God
[1:30:57] vindicated that service so I I have the
[1:31:02] right and the authority to preach it
[1:31:04] like I'm preaching because God Himself
[1:31:06] indicated it I would tell you something
[1:31:10] and and I don't know how it is how it
[1:31:13] can be but all I know is that when that
[1:31:16] man who was leading hallelujah
[1:31:18] hallelujah I said oh my god that sound
[1:31:21] just like me I said but that's
[1:31:22] impossible
[1:31:25] but he did in my years he did and I kept
[1:31:29] singing and kept listening and I'm like
[1:31:31] oh that's impossible but God can make
[1:31:35] all things possible
[1:31:37] I don't understand it but I was among
[1:31:40] that choir well somebody didn't sound
[1:31:42] like me Oh God have mercy listen Joe to
[1:31:49] $0.07 they shall run like mighty men
[1:31:52] they should climb the wall like in a war
[1:31:55] and they shall march everyone on his
[1:31:58] ways and they shall not break their
[1:32:01] ranks neither shall one thrust another
[1:32:05] y'all know what that means you're not
[1:32:07] gonna kill your brother
[1:32:09] you're not gonna warn your brother not
[1:32:12] on purpose
[1:32:13] you're not going to thrust him right
[1:32:15] they shall walk everyone in his path and
[1:32:18] when they fall upon the sword
[1:32:21] they should not be wounded I'm gonna
[1:32:28] tell you something a lot of the times
[1:32:29] you know we look at this call message
[1:32:31] you know what we do we say to ourselves
[1:32:33] well we need to get on a car but we
[1:32:36] leave everybody else out hallelujah and
[1:32:41] we fail to recognize the body of Christ
[1:32:44] the body of Christ is not everybody
[1:32:48] that's around this message the body of
[1:32:50] Christ
[1:32:50] are those who are sealed with the Holy
[1:32:52] Ghost that's the body of Christ well say
[1:32:58] what hey listen I believe it all my
[1:33:00] heart that a man knowing that he should
[1:33:02] be baptized the name of Lord Jesus
[1:33:04] Christ will Pitt be penalized for not
[1:33:06] being in fact baptized right but you got
[1:33:09] somebody that don't know it but yet God
[1:33:11] is giving them the Holy Ghost how are
[1:33:13] you gonna judge it and I know a lot of
[1:33:16] message people wouldn't like that but I
[1:33:17] care I don't care not like that I'm just
[1:33:20] interested in the way the Prophet
[1:33:22] preacher
[1:33:22] I'm taught about all it's all nonsense
[1:33:25] that people have thrown in here because
[1:33:27] they brought their denominational spirit
[1:33:29] in this message and he ain't never been
[1:33:30] born again you understand what we've
[1:33:35] done but brother Branham said watch
[1:33:37] that's all
[1:33:39] watch that spiritual bride there is a
[1:33:41] spiritual bride and I'm part of it yes
[1:33:48] sir if there be therefore any
[1:33:51] consolation in Christ I'm closing on
[1:33:53] this if any confident love if any
[1:33:55] fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels
[1:33:58] and mercies fulfil ye like joy this is
[1:34:02] what he says Paul he said that ye be
[1:34:04] like-minded having the same love being
[1:34:07] of one Accord and of one mind let
[1:34:11] nothing be done through strife or
[1:34:14] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[1:34:18] each esteem others better than
[1:34:21] themselves look not every man on his own
[1:34:25] things but every man also on the things
[1:34:28] of others that means you should be more
[1:34:30] concerned about your brothers and your
[1:34:32] sisters than you are yourself we're all
[1:34:39] guilty where it comes to me just like it
[1:34:43] comes to you we're all guilty and
[1:34:46] sometimes here's a brother Jared he
[1:34:50] hadn't come yet or Jeremy I don't know
[1:34:52] whether he's gonna ever visit us or not
[1:34:53] but anyway this brother he said listen
[1:34:56] he's looking for fellowship and I was
[1:34:59] hard in my spirit only man who's not
[1:35:03] looking for fellowship and really none
[1:35:07] of us should ever feel lonely because we
[1:35:11] got more than two people in this church
[1:35:14] but there are those who do we just got
[1:35:23] to work on it let God help us you know
[1:35:27] that love the Lord I'm almost done look
[1:35:33] not every man on his own things but
[1:35:34] every man also on the things other
[1:35:36] that's the mighty God unveiled before
[1:35:39] that's the message that came from in
[1:35:41] 1964 the man I used that scripted and it
[1:35:44] was too
[1:35:46] People of God rapture ready rapture
[1:35:49] ready means love in loving one another
[1:35:51] more than we love ourselves that's what
[1:35:54] it is I need to be there I'm not saying
[1:36:01] I'm there I need to be there I was
[1:36:08] telling a brother earlier I said you
[1:36:10] know what how many times I'm called at
[1:36:12] times for witnessing people go down
[1:36:14] witness with me and what I get just my
[1:36:16] family too busy for that is everybody's
[1:36:27] in their own thing and following
[1:36:29] leadership is important is this okay
[1:36:35] if you fall on the sword it won't kill
[1:36:41] you but I want correction and when God
[1:36:47] came here the other night that really
[1:36:48] blessed my soul and I'm gonna tell you
[1:36:51] something it was not my imagination
[1:36:52] I threw it out there and I had no idea
[1:36:55] other people that heard I just hoped but
[1:36:58] I told what people in Iowa City because
[1:37:00] it was filming everything I said
[1:37:01] wouldn't that be wonderful give his own
[1:37:03] tape the God would grant us to hear
[1:37:06] those voices again I need help y'all
[1:37:11] pray for me because my desire is to
[1:37:14] really see this church but until this
[1:37:17] little group you don't want to court
[1:37:19] stop colonizing ourselves and separating
[1:37:22] ourselves and and we sometimes think I
[1:37:25] don't know what you think but all I know
[1:37:27] is everybody in hitting to stop it just
[1:37:30] home allow sales and think about one
[1:37:33] purpose and that is to see that this
[1:37:35] message shake Iowa I told those people
[1:37:42] in Iowa City because they they love to
[1:37:45] have me come down but I told me you know
[1:37:47] what I said I don't know what all God is
[1:37:48] gonna do and I don't know what all God's
[1:37:50] doing I said but God brought me here I'm
[1:37:54] not gonna be distracted I know God is
[1:37:56] doing something down there
[1:37:58] you understand me but I'm not getting
[1:38:00] it's place it's been vindicated but how
[1:38:05] can I get everybody to see what I'm
[1:38:06] trying to get him to do brother
[1:38:09] branham's talked about the people who in
[1:38:11] his day on listened to it option on the
[1:38:13] adoption for any brother man talks about
[1:38:17] how there's one brother died with a beat
[1:38:22] but uh not Bosworth um
[1:38:28] the man from our Chicago Way he's like a
[1:38:31] Swedish man huh Jose he said Beau's a
[1:38:36] he's even he tells all the things Jose
[1:38:39] don't even need this message but he
[1:38:43] loved him and he said look what Beau's a
[1:38:47] has done for Christ don't have no gift
[1:38:50] at all but he can't breathe and he said
[1:38:54] he took what he had and has won
[1:38:56] thousands of people maybe millions to
[1:38:58] people to Christ with just what he had
[1:39:00] he said what about those of you who
[1:39:02] believed this message and he said it's
[1:39:05] so sad because the time has passed their
[1:39:10] time to do what they needed to do was
[1:39:13] not done I don't want my time your time
[1:39:18] to pass and we have not done what God
[1:39:21] has done ordained us to do look at what
[1:39:24] we got look at this message he said you
[1:39:26] ought to be zealous about this message
[1:39:28] every day that's what he said don't
[1:39:31] listen to it every day not some day
[1:39:33] every day somebody need to be told I
[1:39:35] need help lord
[1:39:43] y'all know what I'm saying my point is
[1:39:47] this Russia you should believe in this
[1:39:50] message if you have no zeal enjoy it's
[1:39:56] like the rich girl ooh you got all this
[1:39:58] food on the table and you don't even
[1:39:59] give Lazarus none that is a poor man
[1:40:03] that needs it he's got to eat crumbs
[1:40:04] from your cake may God help us
[1:40:09] physically I know some of us are not
[1:40:11] able time time with the ones of us who
[1:40:13] are able you know that's what he says he
[1:40:16] said look at me and what was his
[1:40:18] assistant brother never he said we're
[1:40:21] getting old
[1:40:22] he said we won't be able to do as much
[1:40:25] as we used to do basically I'm
[1:40:26] paraphrasing but don't listen to it
[1:40:27] these are look at all these young people
[1:40:29] he said that's what we needed to
[1:40:32] understand we must prepare him prepare
[1:40:35] for their tomorrow he saying how down it
[1:40:40] down there and Jefferson field how they
[1:40:42] were taking the fish in the nets and
[1:40:44] catching them and killing them in his
[1:40:45] stitch just do whatever they want to do
[1:40:48] with the fish he said they're not even
[1:40:49] thinking about the generation to come
[1:40:51] is it because if they keep going the way
[1:40:54] they go on from my son or somebody to
[1:40:56] catch the so-called fish would be outlaw
[1:40:58] what was he doing you killing more
[1:41:00] people or fish faster than they can
[1:41:03] multiply because of greed and whatever
[1:41:07] more he said they're not preparing for
[1:41:10] their children now this message have
[1:41:13] been prepared for us there have been
[1:41:15] people who have stood and did the best
[1:41:17] they could do for us we don't know how
[1:41:19] long GOG Andheri I trust he don't tear

[1:41:57] are we seeing in this atmosphere and
