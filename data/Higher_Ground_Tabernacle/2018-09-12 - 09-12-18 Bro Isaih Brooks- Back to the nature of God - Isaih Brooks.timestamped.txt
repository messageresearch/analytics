[3:10] toldja that's my victory song amen
[3:15] without a handkerchief again tonight no
[3:20] I don't have one that's right you love
[3:22] the Lord
[3:23] we appreciate God in His grace
[3:29] [Music]
[3:30] quite unusual when you behind the church
[3:34] where there's more men than women
[3:38] appreciate our sister valonda how
[3:42] faithful so say there my wife is at home
[3:47] feeling a little under the weather she's
[3:49] been very busy today and you know when
[3:52] school comes in how people what they do
[3:55] and how they do but we thank God for
[3:58] those of you who have come to the house
[4:00] of God we have a precious brothers with
[4:05] us tonight and some of you know him from
[4:08] the last time i brother richard lee from
[4:13] georgetown guyana
[4:15] he will be ministering for us on Sunday
[4:19] by God's grace there are issues that I
[4:23] need to go down to Iowa City correct I
[4:27] know just a lot of things happening
[4:28] people and I know that I've have been
[4:32] gone a lot and I appreciate your
[4:34] patience with me but in due time God
[4:37] will have it all straightened out by
[4:39] God's grace we love you because you love
[4:42] us we're gonna love you even if you
[4:44] don't love us
[4:46] but we really do think you appreciate
[4:48] our brother coming if he would mind just
[4:52] greet us would you please brother I will
[4:57] be back for sudden the evening service
[4:59] we will have communion this time I won't
[5:01] forget the bread a very good friend of
[5:11] mine we've met many years ago and you
[5:13] know I really appreciate the friendship
[5:16] in the Word of God and it's not just
[5:18] based upon friendship but it's based
[5:21] upon the revelation of the word amen
[5:23] many times I said that you know it's
[5:25] good to have friends and I don't like to
[5:26] lose friends but if you have to lose
[5:29] friend because of the revelation of the
[5:31] word it's a friend worthwhile losing
[5:34] amen because we come to realize that
[5:35] there's so much of compromise that is
[5:37] going on you know sometimes people want
[5:40] you to be
[5:40] negative as a believer but God is never
[5:43] never negative in God the Word of God
[5:46] has a standard yeah understanded is his
[5:48] word Haman
[5:49] I'm so happy and thankful that you know
[5:51] there may not be many who will stand on
[5:53] the word but the Bible tells us or true
[5:56] the Prophet any man stand for God stands
[5:59] alone and we truly thank God for grace
[6:01] that he says you know I will build my
[6:04] church and the gates of hell sorry not
[6:07] you fail again see this is not a man's
[6:10] thing but it is come to realize that
[6:13] when God gives you a pasta minister it
[6:17] must be by a revelation yeah because you
[6:19] must know who your pasta is you must
[6:22] know where you ought to be
[6:23] fellowshipping because if you you will
[6:26] be in a place and you'll never grow it
[6:29] doesn't matter what happened but with
[6:30] the revelation of who you are who your
[6:32] past is and where you ought to be then
[6:35] you can put your full support in
[6:37] fellowship on in prayer and then you can
[6:39] because God is a God of harmony and that
[6:42] is what he wants us to the common I'm so
[6:43] happy and thankful just passing this way
[6:46] I was telling but I don't know when
[6:49] again I be passing here because you know
[6:51] to come here you need to get a visa and
[6:53] then it will be expiring you know in a
[6:56] while from now but anyway we have a
[6:58] greater meeting and that's the meeting
[7:01] in the air by the grace of God we will
[7:03] continue this great fellowship because
[7:05] you know the Bible says that nothing can
[7:08] separate us see and when we say us many
[7:13] time be so selfish a lot but us we are
[7:18] all God's children he said nothing can
[7:20] separate us if you're a God's people and
[7:23] we are all share of God together we are
[7:25] all in the economy of God amen
[7:27] his mindedness and just our selfishness
[7:35] and we better realize that it's God's
[7:37] family and nothing can separate us from
[7:39] the love of God and I want to tell you I
[7:41] love you all and you're always part of
[7:43] my life in prayer and in support by the
[7:46] grace of God and let us continue to
[7:48] serve God and I would enjoy being here
[7:52] for the few days of fellowship God
[7:54] richly bless you amen God is so good to
[8:07] us
[8:10] we're just gonna go right into the Word
[8:12] of God I love that music brother I
[8:16] didn't know whether you were gonna be
[8:18] here Wednesday Oh Lord let him be here
[8:19] this evening I appreciate your sacrifice
[8:23] he's in school so I know how things can
[8:26] change in a moment's time but we think
[8:29] are for everybody by God's grace and you
[8:32] know we've been talking about the nature
[8:34] of God is this thing on okay we've been
[8:38] talking about the nature of God and we
[8:40] still want to talk a little bit more
[8:42] about it because I believe God has given
[8:45] me a little more understanding a little
[8:47] more revelation so we're gonna chew on
[8:49] this for a little bit until God says we
[8:51] finish we want to get all the nutrients
[8:55] out of it as much as possible and so we
[8:58] thank God for His goodness and His grace
[9:00] and brotherly coming with us seated we
[9:03] weren't expecting him so soon we knew he
[9:05] was coming
[9:06] amen it's kind of like you know Christ
[9:09] it comes when you least expect him you
[9:12] know time shortens amen so we thank God
[9:15] for him and especially he has so many
[9:18] places he could have gone but God laid
[9:21] his heart laid us on his heart so come
[9:25] in expectation this coming Sunday
[9:30] brother while I'm thinking about it
[9:33] brother Colley do you have do you have a
[9:35] prayer cloth okay I have one in my
[9:39] pocket I was just wondering but we still
[9:41] want to pray for you after service if
[9:43] it's okay
[9:43] when service is done brothers has some
[9:47] issues but I know God is more than
[9:49] abling and we really want to join in
[9:52] faith and prayer with him that God give
[9:54] him total deliverance amen he may have
[9:58] come and gotten prayer before but I
[9:59] believe I can I can empathize with him
[10:04] on some things amen so I just know by
[10:06] God's grace amen the Lord is in this
[10:10] place you said well brother Brooks I
[10:12] don't see him well I don't know what
[10:13] you're looking at but I see him and I
[10:16] see him in you and if we miss seeing God
[10:19] in each other we miss God it's that
[10:22] right that's right hey man
[10:23] so as we stand on this turn amen
[10:27] glad to see our brother Keith he was
[10:28] telling me he didn't know exactly when
[10:30] he was going to be able to come in but
[10:31] we think God for amen
[10:34] I was always good to see every one of
[10:38] you see our brother physically able the
[10:43] Lord touched him and I remember the
[10:46] voicemail that he was saying he wouldn't
[10:47] be here because of you know he wasn't
[10:49] feeling well and so anyway we're just
[10:51] glad to see everybody uh you know
[10:54] there's a time when when the people
[10:57] wouldn't show up I would literally I
[10:59] would just get so discouraged but you
[11:02] know what I don't have that in me now
[11:06] you know I don't you know because I
[11:10] realized I mean that's that's the way
[11:13] it's got to be you know brother branham
[11:15] even tells us that before it's all over
[11:17] he said it might be a handful you know
[11:21] and I'm trusting that that if there is a
[11:24] handful we are that handful that will
[11:27] make a rapture there are so many people
[11:30] who are not taking rapture and not
[11:32] thinking that's what we've been called
[11:34] for we have been called to divide defied
[11:38] nature gravity and and every man-made
[11:42] thing that would try to hinder us from
[11:45] being what God would have us to be but
[11:49] we have an assurance in the word and
[11:52] that insurance is that he that begun the
[11:54] good work in us is faithful to complete
[11:57] it as we stand let us turn to Matthew 12
[12:03] we're going to read the 33rd and 34th
[12:06] verse then we'll ask you to turn with us
[12:18] to John 17 Matthew 12:33 234 and it says
[12:28] either make the tree good and it's fruit
[12:31] good or else make the tree corrupt and
[12:35] his fruit corrupt for the tree is known
[12:38] by his fruit old generation of vipers
[12:42] how can ye being evil speak good things
[12:45] for out of the abundance of the heart
[12:48] the mouth speaketh st. John 17 st. John
[13:06] 17 we're going to start reading from the
[13:08] 22nd verse to the 24th and then from
[13:11] there we'll go to 1st John 4 st. John
[13:17] 17:20 2nd verse and the glory which dog
[13:21] gave me I have given them that they may
[13:25] be one even as we are one I and them
[13:30] thou and me that they may be made
[13:33] perfect in one and that the world may
[13:37] know that thou has set me and has loved
[13:40] them as thou has loved me father I will
[13:44] that they also whom thou has given me be
[13:47] with me where I am that they may behold
[13:51] my glory with thou has given me but thou
[13:55] loveth me before the foundation of the
[13:58] world first John 4 beginning at the
[14:06] seventeenth verse st. John 4 beginning
[14:13] at the 17th verse
[14:16] herein is our love made perfect that we
[14:21] may have boldness in the Day of Judgment
[14:23] because as he is so are we
[14:28] in this world there is no fear in love
[14:31] but perfect love casts out fear because
[14:35] fear hath torment he that feareth is not
[14:41] made perfect in love
[14:44] let us pray father we thank you for your
[14:49] amazing grace thank you for this time
[14:51] Lord God that you have given us O God to
[14:55] worship and to praise you and to thank
[14:57] you for everything that you have done
[15:01] and is doing for us Lord God there are
[15:04] no words and to to express in the
[15:08] English language how much we love and
[15:11] appreciate you but outside of these
[15:14] words we we want a life the life the
[15:18] only life your life
[15:19] o God to live in us O God we want to be
[15:23] living epistles written and read even as
[15:27] you have later laid it out in the word
[15:30] may the Word of God quicken us Lord to
[15:33] live the spoken word help us now as we
[15:37] commit the service into your hands
[15:39] father we thank you in Jesus Christ's
[15:41] name we pray amen
[15:43] you may be seated remember I think the
[15:47] last time we spoke we talked about the
[15:50] natures of God we showed by God's grace
[15:52] how that God nature is not only like a
[15:56] dove but it's also like a lamb it's its
[16:00] nature as pure it's clean as a dove and
[16:03] meek and humble like a lamb and we
[16:07] showed you by God's grace that when we
[16:10] were born we brother branham even call
[16:12] eve the tree of knowledge of good and
[16:15] evil there was a time where she was life
[16:19] but because she ate up all of that tree
[16:21] she became the tree of knowledge of good
[16:24] and evil
[16:25] in other words brother Adam says she's
[16:26] now the tree of death and we realized by
[16:29] God's grace because she is the tree of
[16:31] death we have been transformed if you
[16:35] want to say it our hybrid ate it into a
[16:39] tree that it's good and evil
[16:42] and Jesus when he was talking there in
[16:44] Matthew he says now that that will not
[16:47] do anymore you either make the tree good
[16:49] or you make the tree evil and and you
[16:52] know I me and you there's no way of
[16:54] making the tree good nothing that we can
[16:57] do to make the tree good you see the
[17:00] only thing that could ever make this
[17:02] tree good is that there be a seed that's
[17:06] good on the inside right it must be a
[17:10] God seed only inside that would
[17:13] literally change this kokuboro amen into
[17:17] wheat because brother branham tells us
[17:20] that we came into this world as a
[17:22] kookabura amen we a child of wrath with
[17:25] the appearance of the children of wrath
[17:28] but he said on the inside of the inside
[17:31] there was a wheat germ it is only
[17:35] because of that wheat germ you and I can
[17:38] be changed into something we call wheat
[17:42] is that right now you must understand
[17:45] that that seed in itself Amen was
[17:48] predestinated it was so before the
[17:51] foundation of the world is that right so
[17:54] we must realize Amen that because of the
[17:58] seed we can never be an organization we
[18:02] can never follow Creed's we can never
[18:04] follow dogmas because we are the
[18:08] producers of the life of God because of
[18:12] the seed that's in you right it's not
[18:15] you that produces the life it's not you
[18:18] that produces the change is to see
[18:20] that's in you and understand we are
[18:23] obligated to make sure that the seed is
[18:26] quickened right sometime for the man say
[18:31] sometimes it takes a child of God a long
[18:34] time before he realized that he is a son
[18:38] or daughter of God nevertheless it is
[18:42] still in the hands of the Lord amen to
[18:46] do what he will with us now we talk
[18:50] about circumstances and sometimes
[18:52] circumstances sometimes they seeing
[18:55] are quite difficult for us but
[18:58] understand the scripture says that all
[19:00] things work together for the good of
[19:02] them that love the Lord those who are
[19:05] called according to his purpose in other
[19:08] words God's promise will have
[19:11] preeminence over everything you go
[19:14] through in life his purpose will be done
[19:21] right so whatever God has determined his
[19:26] purpose will become will be all always
[19:28] will be victorious is that right and you
[19:32] and I must understand that we are called
[19:35] and we are chosen if we are elected it
[19:38] is really a win-win situation but you
[19:43] must understand that there are always
[19:45] something that you and I must do God
[19:49] can't repent for you you must repent
[19:54] right and when it comes to to being
[19:58] sanctified God it's not going to make it
[20:01] happen he's given you the power to be
[20:06] sanctified and that is the blood of
[20:08] Jesus Christ in other words he gave you
[20:12] the vacuum cleaner his it's up to you to
[20:15] cut it on and get the dirt up right the
[20:19] vacuum cleaners stand right there it's
[20:22] plugged up to the power but if you don't
[20:25] turn the switch on its of no value to
[20:28] you that's how it is with the Holy Ghost
[20:30] though you may have it is of no value to
[20:33] you if you don't put it to use right now
[20:38] listen this is what he says Israel in
[20:41] the church he says no I never said that
[20:44] he said look a grain of wheat can only
[20:48] produce wheat it cannot produce kokuboro
[20:53] there's no desire in it there's no light
[20:57] in it to produce kokuboro
[21:00] with and if we're in Christ Jesus he
[21:04] said don't be deceived
[21:06] you had better searched
[21:09] is closed now she keep on saying well I
[21:12] don't it don't condemn me to do this and
[21:17] it don't condemn me to do that things of
[21:19] the world he says now I'm going to hurt
[21:22] you a little bit pull the feathers back
[21:24] the other way but it is this one short
[21:29] evidence you have never been to Christ
[21:33] you've never been born again if things
[21:37] of the world doesn't continue he's
[21:40] basically saying check yourself because
[21:45] if they don't condemn you you haven't
[21:48] been born again understand this God does
[21:54] not look at you as as oh I think I'm
[21:58] going to seal this person every age
[22:04] before the Holy Ghost came to minister
[22:07] to that age the cedar was already there
[22:12] in other words God purpose for rand-new
[22:17] before you came here God is waiting on
[22:22] you oh come on somebody see you must
[22:27] understand on the each seal the first a
[22:30] second whatever or each church age you
[22:32] must understand they only need the dogs
[22:35] who were ordained to be saved under
[22:39] those Church ages were saved before they
[22:41] got here
[22:44] everybody that sealed in the seven
[22:47] churches or what we call the bride age
[22:49] you were sealed before you got here but
[22:53] it's up to you to get there in other
[22:57] words you said what about Mary Mary was
[23:00] always in the scripture Mary had the
[23:03] baby Jesus before she got here in the
[23:07] mind of God she had already done it but
[23:10] you see Mary didn't know who she was so
[23:15] God had to bring forth some
[23:18] circumstances in her life that
[23:21] perhaps uncomfortable to her like God
[23:25] will do did you some of us will we we
[23:28] want to sin us and we did what we wanted
[23:30] to do and then God brought some unwanted
[23:34] circumstances in your life that causes
[23:37] you to look up right so let me say it
[23:42] like this when we talk about and I was
[23:46] saying this just the other day I said we
[23:48] talk about people that's really born
[23:51] again let's use the animals when a cow
[23:54] is born it's a calf and guess what that
[23:59] camp does it goes straight to the place
[24:01] where it was going
[24:03] there's no teacher there's no preacher
[24:06] there is nothing to tell that calf go to
[24:09] mama cuz that's where the strengths lie
[24:12] only but it is ordained as something in
[24:16] it that makes it run amen to the place
[24:19] of safety and in life a horse the same
[24:22] way no education nothing there to tell
[24:26] it other than that god-given instinct
[24:30] hallelujah it's just so it's just a
[24:33] thing that's in you and so when when a
[24:36] child of God is really born again he
[24:40] goes to the person or to the place that
[24:42] gave gives you birth and that's the ones
[24:45] you don't have to beg them to pray you
[24:47] don't have to beg in the past you don't
[24:48] have to beg in the come to church you
[24:50] don't have the megohm because that life
[24:52] will compel them to do so
[24:54] it is the nature of a son of God to run
[24:58] to his daddy
[25:03] Jesus distinctly says one is of the
[25:06] father and one is of the devil and when
[25:09] a grain of wheat falls into the earth no
[25:12] matter if that grain of wheat dies to
[25:15] itself it cannot produce a cocklebur in
[25:20] other words when you really die to
[25:22] yourself you're not bearing to nature's
[25:28] when you're
[25:30] is truly saved you are not bearing to
[25:33] nature's a grain of wheat will bring
[25:38] forth the grain of wheat just as sure as
[25:40] anything and if we are sold with the
[25:44] incorruptible seed of God how can it
[25:46] produce anything but a life of Christ
[25:51] let's not fool ourselves it is going to
[25:55] produce a life if that seed is in you
[25:58] and it is quick and like you say it is
[26:01] it will produce life he is the tree of
[26:05] life and if you have a seed from the
[26:08] tree of life you will produce my not
[26:12] education not educated into it
[26:15] but it will be life and you will not
[26:19] even be able to stop it the Holy Spirit
[26:25] leading the church leads in the power of
[26:29] the resurrection of Jesus Christ y'all
[26:32] hear me let me say it again the Holy
[26:35] Spirit leading the church least it in
[26:39] the power of the resurrection of Jesus
[26:43] Christ and you are sealed unto the day
[26:46] of redemption in otherwise when you are
[26:49] truly born again the Holy Spirit leads
[26:52] you into these virtues he doesn't beg us
[26:57] he leads us yea understand what I'm
[27:01] saying it is something that pulls is
[27:04] like a cab pulling from his mother and
[27:08] like I was saying you know it's like a
[27:09] cab when that calf is first born if that
[27:12] mother is not quite ready what does he
[27:14] do he knocks on the door he will hit
[27:19] that mother's y'all know what I'm saying
[27:21] until that mother is ready to give milk
[27:24] and so is it with with the true
[27:27] born-again believer you and he know he
[27:30] needs nourishment we didn't know he
[27:31] needs these things in his life he will
[27:34] continue to put on al-sharia until he's
[27:37] floor it is in him he cannot settle for
[27:42] being
[27:43] just ordinary Christian or ordinary
[27:45] person in this day our desire should be
[27:49] to be in the statue of in the perfect of
[27:52] Christ you know me you know we will not
[27:55] commoners
[27:56] we're princes with Kings real royalty
[27:59] and it is something in us that makes us
[28:02] want to see those things not offensive
[28:05] in our lives
[28:10] if you slow on that something is wrong
[28:16] there's no time it's not you know how
[28:18] people I've had when I was in the
[28:20] Pentecostal people our world apostolic
[28:23] there were sisters who maybe one or two
[28:25] that literally deceived himself and
[28:28] mentally built up and made themself
[28:31] pregnant they went through all the
[28:34] symptoms they even went through a growth
[28:37] period and when the doctors examine them
[28:40] there was nothing but psychologically
[28:44] they believed that they were pregnant go
[28:48] search it out it happens and you and I
[28:53] were not in a time that we need to be
[28:55] psychologically pregnant we need to know
[28:59] that we've been with our mate it is an
[29:04] experience hallelujah there is no way
[29:08] that you're gonna have a mate with God
[29:10] and not know it doesn't make sense
[29:19] hallelujah understand amen even in the
[29:23] key in the time of Esther Amen that King
[29:25] can mate with any woman he wanted to but
[29:31] everyone he made it with never did get
[29:33] pregnant hello
[29:36] and there was there was there was some
[29:38] that he made it with one time and all he
[29:40] became was concubines for the rest of
[29:42] their lives
[29:43] but that was a meant that he chose like
[29:47] Esther she became Queen and her
[29:53] experience with the King was
[29:57] over and over and over you know
[29:59] understand what I'm saying I mean that's
[30:02] I don't understand how people as a
[30:04] Christian can just settle for one
[30:06] experience oh oh oh I can remember 10
[30:08] years ago when the Lord did something
[30:10] for me you ought to have an experience
[30:12] with your husband every day
[30:14] impossible the spirit leading the church
[30:20] leads it to the power of the
[30:22] resurrection of Jesus Christ and you
[30:23] sealed unto the day of your Redemption
[30:25] that's the Bible grieve not the Holy
[30:28] Spirit of God whereby you were sealing
[30:30] to the day of your redemption now before
[30:32] the Holy Spirit ever come this is where
[30:34] I got to start he is sealed away before
[30:37] the Gentile age ever started you
[30:40] understand me
[30:41] so he was always he was already sealing
[30:44] already waiting already there see and so
[30:51] you said well what do you mean what I'm
[30:52] saying what I'm saying I'm true real if
[30:55] you really believe this message you want
[30:57] to go beyond belief you want to see
[31:00] action you want to see God do what he's
[31:04] promised to do for you and to you in
[31:07] this age you don't settle for being a
[31:10] charge remember you don't settle for
[31:12] just like I said when it comes to just
[31:14] knowing the message and you don't
[31:15] receive the messenger and I'm not
[31:17] talking about profit I'm talking about
[31:19] the king the Christ amen who was the
[31:22] real messenger if you don't receive him
[31:25] you end up with the mark of the beast
[31:30] now before the Holy Ghost ever come he
[31:34] is sealed away before the Gentile age
[31:35] ever started he is sealed away under
[31:39] them golden candlesticks back there
[31:42] under that age and remember I was
[31:48] telling you we working with these things
[31:51] and I want to show you that the approach
[31:53] that Jesus tooked him when Calvary was
[31:56] not by sword because he told Peter he
[32:00] said he said unto Peter if you if you
[32:02] fight with the sword you're gonna die by
[32:05] the sword
[32:06] this is not how we fight
[32:08] Alma is divine love hallelujah amen in
[32:14] Paul's day it was safe virgin all the
[32:18] way up but our armor our defense our way
[32:23] of conquering because the Bible says is
[32:25] that right did y'all know that every age
[32:27] had Purdue had to produce that every age
[32:30] had to produced what was required of
[32:32] them and we've come to a place where
[32:35] people don't even have brotherly
[32:37] kindness but listen that's the seventh
[32:41] but what about the eighth Brenham took
[32:45] up took us behind the curtain of time
[32:47] and told us back there is divine love
[32:50] you've got to have the ego you got to
[32:54] have the dog nature i'ma prove it to you
[32:58] in just a moment that nature must come
[33:01] Oh amen like a brother Troy like I said
[33:06] this is it was inspiring Speier inspired
[33:08] by his message because the dog and the
[33:11] lamb are compatible brother Branham says
[33:15] they men with long as you've got that
[33:16] dumb nature God to stay with you but
[33:19] when you let that dumb nature turn into
[33:21] a wolf he said the Holy Spirit would fly
[33:23] off not that he's leaving you because he
[33:26] can't he promised you he wouldn't I
[33:28] never leave you nor forsake you but you
[33:30] won't feel that communion with him until
[33:33] that dog nature comes back and the wolf
[33:36] nature is gone and you wonder why I
[33:38] can't pray wonder why I can't feel you
[33:40] wonder like I was saying the other day
[33:42] in Arizona whatever wrong you got you've
[33:45] done you got to make right you say oh me
[33:48] yes even the prophet of God lied he said
[33:52] tell those people I'm not at home his
[33:55] wife said bill do you think that was
[33:56] right and then he had to go pray for a
[34:00] baby and when he would with that pray
[34:03] you know the devil Oh God Jesus are you
[34:05] hypocrite so he had what happened the
[34:10] duck nature though he was the Prophet
[34:12] the dubnation says I'm not there until
[34:15] you make it right
[34:17] you're on your own he had the
[34:21] all those people that confess to them
[34:23] make it right biggie was able to go pray
[34:27] for the baby
[34:28] hello see you gotta realize by God's
[34:32] grace God put things in your way to test
[34:35] those virtues to see whether they're in
[34:38] there or not if it rattles that means by
[34:43] God's grace you're not where you should
[34:45] be
[34:46] hallelujah you say remember I told you
[34:49] about the man at the car wash and how he
[34:52] pushed my button how he broke the button
[34:55] in my car right and how I got so mad you
[34:59] know I I hadn't done that a long time
[35:01] when I get really mad I go like mmm and
[35:07] we like that Luke are you in trouble
[35:09] and in my mind in my mind I had already
[35:13] done what I needed to do I was angry and
[35:18] I hadn't been like that in years I told
[35:21] my wife I didn't even know I could get
[35:23] that angry but what was happening is
[35:25] that they blamed something only when
[35:28] they were the one that broke it what is
[35:30] your fault oh ma had not really got
[35:34] angry that's the best thing that
[35:35] happened to me in a long time because
[35:39] God didn't showed me you're not where
[35:41] you thought you were mmm I'm
[35:44] acknowledging it but then I know where
[35:47] I'm trying to go you understand me
[35:50] try I'm that I'm a lord but no I know
[35:54] why you did it
[35:55] you helped me you pushed you let me
[35:59] enemy pushed me to a place where the
[36:01] seal broke if it was you know the mean
[36:03] showing that this it wasn't completely
[36:05] sealed in yet oh come on somebody and I
[36:09] disgraced Jesus I disgraced the church
[36:12] and I disgraced myself and I went back
[36:15] to that man and I ask his forgiveness
[36:18] told him I was a preacher ask his
[36:22] forgiveness every time I went about
[36:24] three times that seemeth oh I'm so sorry
[36:26] he said no don't worry about it it's
[36:27] taken care of
[36:28] but I thought about it I said Lord what
[36:31] is this thing amen
[36:33] that if this man should ever sit here in
[36:34] my church and I don't have never made it
[36:36] right then you know the devil to do it
[36:40] hmm that's why you can't go out in the
[36:43] world doing all kind of thing you never
[36:45] know when that person is gonna show up
[36:49] in your church gotta bring him right
[36:51] here her whoever you understand me so
[36:55] you look at this thing is or what are
[36:57] you saying if I can't be a reflection of
[37:00] God because that's what I want it is
[37:03] what you need to be right like the
[37:06] reflection you talking about you know a
[37:08] magnifying glass and us boys used to do
[37:11] devious things with it you know we take
[37:13] that magnifying glass and then let it
[37:15] hit the Sun and focus it on something
[37:17] and cause a little fly or something and
[37:19] burn people on it well you know we did
[37:23] things like that but what was it that
[37:25] right that that that time light was
[37:28] magnified through that glass right
[37:31] because in his normal setting it wasn't
[37:33] browning anything but once it was
[37:34] focused Amen into a point and you were
[37:38] able to take that light and build it in
[37:40] a way till it actually produced fire all
[37:43] you take a mirror or something and you
[37:46] you let that light reflecting the person
[37:49] don't know you you got a mirror and you
[37:51] just and they looking everywhere what
[37:54] was it you took that light in that
[37:56] mirror big did so much it became a
[37:58] reflection of the very thing that you
[38:00] that was hitting it and that's what God
[38:03] is looking for he's looking for a real
[38:06] reflection of himself that can literally
[38:09] cause some kind of action or reaction to
[38:12] the very light she beaming down on us Oh
[38:17] God the Bible tells us that when Jesus
[38:20] was baptized that a voice came from
[38:23] heaven it descended like a dove
[38:25] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[38:27] pleased to dwell in hallelujah why
[38:30] because Jesus could not take on the
[38:33] devil in the wilderness without the Holy
[38:35] Ghost he was a man Oh y'all didn't know
[38:39] that he was a man he was a prophet he
[38:44] wept he felt pain
[38:46] he felt sorrow hallelujah but only
[38:48] inside he was God he needed the Holy
[38:52] Ghost to withstand the devil guess what
[38:55] when he got the Holy Ghost that's when
[38:57] God led him into the wilderness to be
[39:00] tempted whoa
[39:02] what was God looking for he was looking
[39:04] for a nature of a death that's why he
[39:10] couldn't use his authority that's why he
[39:13] couldn't say oh let the lightning come
[39:15] down that's why he couldn't just just
[39:18] cause her earthquake or whatever to get
[39:20] rid of the devil he was so humble and
[39:24] clothed with so much humility he just
[39:27] stayed with the word knowing all he had
[39:31] to do was speak it not my real Lord but
[39:35] thine be done
[39:36] hallelujah and when he was so hungry
[39:39] what an uncomfortable situation a
[39:42] situation where he had gone without food
[39:45] for 40 days and then God allowed the
[39:48] devil says who tell him he could turn
[39:51] that bread into that stone into bread
[39:53] hungry guys did Jesus but he rejected it
[40:01] hallelujah and he gave honor to God by
[40:05] saying man does not live by bread alone
[40:07] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[40:09] the mouth of God doesn't it sound like
[40:12] what David did when they cut through
[40:14] those hundreds of people I think mile 15
[40:17] miles of Philistines just to get David a
[40:20] drink of water
[40:21] you think he wasn't thirsty he was more
[40:23] thirsty by the time he came back but
[40:26] instead of dragging it
[40:27] he gave either to God by pouring it out
[40:31] hallelujah showing that even God has a
[40:34] need is that right the Bible said God
[40:41] had a need the Bible said Jesus had need
[40:44] to go by Samaria huh
[40:51] love free will offerings and that's
[40:55] exactly what David gave remember listen
[40:59] when Jesus came and I'm not gonna be
[41:02] long tonight when Jesus came and you
[41:05] know he took the book you know we saw a
[41:08] mighty John was looking Oh we'd not John
[41:11] the Lion of the tribe of Judah has
[41:13] prevailed and we need to looked he saw a
[41:15] lamb that was slain before the
[41:17] foundation of the world I want you to
[41:20] get this because your religion will not
[41:23] get you anywhere oh because I believe
[41:27] the message I you know my you know God
[41:30] don't care it ain't that he came to one
[41:33] of the greater means in his day
[41:34] Nicodemus Nicodemus you must be born
[41:37] again all your education won't get you
[41:42] there because that's carnal but you've
[41:45] gotta have a real expense y'all know
[41:47] what I'm saying
[41:48] it must be a life and then reflecting
[41:51] out of yours he said and when he looked
[41:56] around he said I don't weep not for the
[41:59] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[42:01] David he has prevail again a man he
[42:04] conquered in other words he's worthy to
[42:06] take the book is that right oh my god it
[42:11] is the truth but then the prophet of God
[42:14] says listen they're here brothers he
[42:18] said through weakness through sweetness
[42:21] through the Holy Spirit that we conquer
[42:24] not some great mighty intellectual giant
[42:28] but he that humble himself is the man
[42:30] who conquers the man who can be kicked
[42:33] around and still be a servant of Christ
[42:36] he said that's the Conqueror and you
[42:39] know and I know we're living in an age
[42:41] of pride hallelujah we're living in an
[42:45] age where me it won't be recognized
[42:48] you don't know who I am am I supposed to
[42:51] huh you know that's the way people are I
[42:54] mean I'm gonna tell you I said it i'ma
[42:56] say it again the problem with the
[42:58] message is nothing there's no real
[43:01] problem with the message it's the
[43:02] preachers
[43:05] it is the preachers who are arrogant and
[43:08] prideful and you know building this
[43:10] kingdom and building that Kingdom their
[43:12] love Jesus out of it and they will get
[43:14] their glory but you and I there are
[43:19] people
[43:20] Amen brother brems that when that
[43:22] spiritual bride come forth and you
[43:24] cannot be a spiritual bride would having
[43:26] this big without having this period so
[43:30] what do you mean brother folks let me
[43:31] tell you something yes I can see the
[43:34] northing and brother better preach the
[43:35] message faster nor to giving in in time
[43:38] you think he talked about denominational
[43:40] that day is past hallelujah he talked
[43:43] about people who believe so-called the
[43:45] same message Judas and Jesus in the same
[43:49] message
[43:50] one is the devil in one is God in this
[43:53] message you got the same thing you got
[43:57] Judas and you got Jesus and Jews are
[43:59] sold out the money for saying popularity
[44:03] and that's exactly what you see among us
[44:06] but you see Jesus the Bible said he was
[44:09] so humble he was so humble he had to be
[44:13] kissed by Judas in order for the people
[44:15] to know who he was
[44:21] hmm so you and I must
[44:24] it was a mighty lamb that slew the
[44:26] dragon God himself and that's the only
[44:31] way that's why Paul said love conquers
[44:33] all hello love conquers all that's our
[44:39] weapon tree sweetness and meekness
[44:45] hallelujah and you and I must understand
[44:48] by God's grace
[44:49] there was a time they fought with the
[44:51] sword hallelujah but there was a time
[44:55] think about it the New Testament church
[44:57] went to the slaughter
[44:59] like a lamb huh didn't fight back they
[45:07] went to the slaughter like a lamb if it
[45:09] started off that way is going to end up
[45:12] that way when he doesn't you can produce
[45:17] it's the God in you hallelujah is this
[45:21] all right
[45:22] now sometimes God produces things he
[45:26] allowed things to happen you know to you
[45:29] it so that you can understand what he's
[45:31] doing before I read the scripture let me
[45:33] go back down here to just go here
[45:36] because you got to understand that
[45:38] horrible things come hardships come
[45:41] right and you and I must understand that
[45:44] these hardship calm so that it can make
[45:46] us better Christians mmm guarding
[45:49] against your I'm cursed guarding because
[45:51] that's why the curse you that's why the
[45:53] bob says think it not strange with
[45:55] divers temptations try you that the
[45:57] trying of your faith is more precious
[45:59] than go through so much the God don't
[46:04] put on you no more than you can bear
[46:06] everybody got to go through something I
[46:09] was thinking about the birth of a child
[46:11] the birth of a child is not only mess
[46:13] but it's a mess but it's a trial a
[46:15] traumatic experience for the mother in
[46:17] the child
[46:18] so he's born into death he fights so
[46:21] hard to get here not knowing he's on his
[46:24] way out it's the truth and it's better
[46:31] coming in to rejoicing he comes in
[46:33] crying
[46:36] hallelujah why this world is a world of
[46:39] death and all of us have experienced it
[46:42] and we are experiencing it right now but
[46:46] there is a better life there's a life
[46:48] that there is no death there is no
[46:51] sorrow there is no more birth pains like
[46:55] I said you know crying all 90 men will
[46:58] be over cleaning brass will be over but
[47:04] you and I by the grace of God we're
[47:07] moving into a room Amen that will be so
[47:10] supernatural amen it will be but to the
[47:14] bride that supernatural becomes natural
[47:19] think about it but no I had to go
[47:22] through and if Noah made it you can make
[47:27] it no it's just an example
[47:29] amen of the trip of the foolish virgins
[47:32] but what he not went through is not even
[47:35] written but you don't think Enoch was
[47:38] they did probably thought he was crazy
[47:40] to everybody that really walked with God
[47:44] is insane but he knocked like he said if
[47:47] I gotta lose every friend in the world
[47:49] to walk with God is worth to lost and
[47:52] that must be your attitude as well
[47:57] Enoch walked alone when nobody else
[48:01] walked with him not even his family you
[48:04] see it had a family what I know
[48:05] somewhere brother man said one day
[48:07] eating our way to his family bye-bye but
[48:12] had not that been trials every man every
[48:16] woman that walked with God will face
[48:19] hardships many are the afflictions of
[48:23] the righteous but God will deliver them
[48:26] out of them all that right that's how
[48:29] God builds you that's why you listen
[48:33] you're to believers if you go through
[48:34] tests at the test at the test and you
[48:37] still standing you still love God
[48:40] because there's nothing in your mind to
[48:42] turn back hallelujah and when there's
[48:45] nothing in your mind to turn back the
[48:48] only way you can go with
[48:51] think about it no what do you have to go
[48:54] through a promise of God
[48:56] laughs that mark four hundred and
[48:58] something years building Enoch trialed
[49:02] with his family trials with the out
[49:04] outsider than everybody else
[49:07] hallelujah and then when the doors shut
[49:09] he still had more trouble but daddy I
[49:12] thought it was gonna rain no don't worry
[49:14] about it it's gonna rain
[49:16] how do you know God says so well you
[49:18] said that for so many years how do you
[49:21] know cuz God says so so what are you
[49:24] saying God is trying to move us out of
[49:27] the realm of Hope into a perfect faith
[49:29] and when you have a perfect faith you
[49:32] know God is that right you said what do
[49:36] you mean i'ma jump a little bit when Joe
[49:38] went down the way he did he was already
[49:42] a perfect man in God's eyes he was
[49:44] already upright he was already doing
[49:47] what was president pleasing in the sight
[49:49] of God but God wanted job to know
[49:53] see that word know he wanted Joe I know
[49:58] the relationship had to be more intimate
[50:01] than what it had been lot of rules and
[50:04] regulations he did it all but God wanted
[50:07] him to know who he was and see until you
[50:11] become your God can get you to do
[50:13] operation so you know you are see joke
[50:16] the whole revelation behind this is God
[50:20] wanted job to know who he was and who
[50:24] Joe was right he asked the question he
[50:28] said I've seen flowers grow dying common
[50:31] this net-net
[50:32] but what about man where does he fit in
[50:35] this picture he said I never asked that
[50:38] question because now God has something
[50:41] going on up in heaven and is that right
[50:44] and God stopped the devil what are you
[50:47] going oh I've been going I'm doing for
[50:51] all doing whatever seeking when I made a
[50:54] vow God said hey hey I got something for
[50:59] you have you considered my servant Joe
[51:01] see
[51:02] oh why do I have to go through all is he
[51:12] because he wants you to know who he is
[51:15] and he wants you to know who you are
[51:20] Paula so Joe went through all these
[51:23] trials all these deaths his wife even
[51:26] got a devil owner one day say Joe come
[51:29] show God and I and you know Joe was
[51:32] spiritual
[51:32] he looked beyond that flesh and said
[51:34] well man you sound foolish you don't
[51:37] sound like my wife in other words
[51:39] there's a government high no bars you
[51:42] are nor did and you're not speaking the
[51:44] righteous things of God what about us
[51:49] when the devil are not the ones we love
[51:51] can you see God can you see the devil
[51:54] hello
[51:56] that's what's going to make you go
[51:58] through to understand you're not
[51:59] wrestling against flesh and blood but in
[52:02] spiritual wickedness in high places and
[52:04] just as the Holy Ghost can anoint you
[52:06] the devil can't do but had not been told
[52:13] let me read I'm not reading it just
[52:15] because I can't say it like I want to
[52:16] say it but you gotta realize hey man
[52:19] that when God sends you to troubles he's
[52:21] building you every fight every battle
[52:28] you know you lose a few but you don't
[52:32] lose the war oh yeah oh yeah
[52:39] listen brother Adam said like this there
[52:43] had been no rain until the flood came
[52:46] but at the North was pressed into the
[52:49] condition that he was in to throw forty
[52:52] days and nights in the storm and a
[52:54] little pitching up and down in the water
[52:56] it was after the flood was over then he
[52:59] saw the rainbow for its first time the
[53:03] Covenant of Hope the Covenant of promise
[53:05] after he had gone through the
[53:08] tribulation then he saw the promise
[53:10] that's the way you see the promise after
[53:14] you go through the tribulation
[53:16] like that poem of that song must I carry
[53:19] home to heaven on a flower bed of ease
[53:22] while others fought to win the prize and
[53:25] sail through Braille ec's see as we we
[53:30] asked for comfort and peace and God
[53:33] gives us the best that he could give us
[53:35] trials and tribulation that's better
[53:39] than comfort in peace our confidence is
[53:42] just beyond the river it was until the
[53:46] Hebrew boys was forced into the fiery
[53:49] furnace on one of their most outstanding
[53:53] trials that they'd seen one like the Son
[53:57] of God standing among them their
[54:00] troubles produced the Son of God
[54:02] standing among them in the breezes to
[54:05] wave away the heat away but not until
[54:08] they went into the fiery fire did they
[54:12] get that comforter or that comforter
[54:15] appear you said what what do you mean
[54:17] well what about Stephen how many bricks
[54:21] had to hit him before the heavens opened
[54:24] before he saw God was standing and the
[54:27] Christ standing at the right hand of God
[54:29] y'all understand me he wasn't mad he
[54:33] wasn't angry he had to dub nature he had
[54:36] the Holy Ghost on the inside of him that
[54:39] could literally speak from his heart
[54:41] father ladies things not to their charge
[54:45] no man could have done that but it was
[54:48] the nature of the Tree of Life
[54:49] it was Christ in us is that right the
[54:54] Bible said that Abel that coveted that
[54:57] we had have rather is greater than the
[55:00] coveted and Abel had because Abel was
[55:02] seeking for revenge
[55:04] but this covenant Amen the Christ gave
[55:07] to us amen was birth under the
[55:10] inspiration of Father forgive them for
[55:13] they know not what they do
[55:14] he loved his enemy even unto the death
[55:20] that's the nature that would get us to
[55:23] heaven look
[55:27] says it was until the Hebrew children
[55:34] was forced into the fiery furnace and
[55:37] one of their most outstanding trials I
[55:41] read again that they seen the one like
[55:43] the son of God standing among them their
[55:45] troubles produce listen their troubles
[55:48] produce the son of God standing among
[55:51] them in the breezes their travels
[55:54] produced it so understand that your
[55:57] troubles will produce a birth some
[56:00] supernatural thing will come out of this
[56:03] every trial hallelujah that you go
[56:06] through understand there's a reward at
[56:08] the end of it every test every trial you
[56:13] go through if you just hold fast to the
[56:16] Word of God God will produce something
[56:18] look at look at Jonah I'm excuse me look
[56:22] at a joke going back to him how his
[56:24] children weigh out their party and
[56:26] everything else he went through it he
[56:29] lost everything his house is gadelle his
[56:31] bike basic everything and God said don't
[56:34] worry Joe you have passed the test I
[56:37] crown you y'all understand me he said
[56:41] I'm not going to just give all that I
[56:43] took from you back seven times I'm gonna
[56:45] multiply it but I'm also gonna restore
[56:48] your children is that right in other
[56:51] words that resurrection you saw your
[56:54] children will be waiting on you don't
[56:58] ever think that you're suffering for no
[57:00] reason you're suffering because you're
[57:05] like a lily you've got to be crushed
[57:08] thank God for the crushing your
[57:13] suffering is a blessing our suffering is
[57:16] a blessing when we talk about peace and
[57:20] comfort that's what cursed us that's why
[57:23] weaker that's what's cursing the people
[57:25] now easy living their devil want you to
[57:28] have all this peace and comfort and you
[57:30] don't even see it it's bringing the fire
[57:33] down but trials will put you on the
[57:36] prayer on the altar trials will put you
[57:39] there in a cab
[57:40] lord have mercy loud you see what I'm
[57:43] saying and sometimes God wants
[57:45] fellowship and that's the only way he
[57:48] can get it sometimes by sending you
[57:49] through the fire they'll remember he's a
[57:55] jealous God and he's not going to allow
[57:57] you to love anything or anyone more than
[58:00] you love him
[58:02] hello it was Daniel who had purpose in
[58:09] his heart that he would not defile
[58:12] himself with the things of the world and
[58:14] was forced through a trial whether he
[58:16] would pray to God or to to a lion's den
[58:19] I'll go to a lion's den but it was after
[58:22] that the heat was put on and he was
[58:26] thrown into the Lions Den that app that
[58:29] he saw the angel the law standing in the
[58:32] midst of him
[58:33] keeping away the great pillar of fire
[58:36] standing between him and the Lions and
[58:39] the Lions could not get him because he
[58:42] had went through the trial and
[58:43] temptation and troubles and he knew that
[58:46] this that his God was able to deliver
[58:49] him from that is that right so you got
[58:53] to understand that's why Joe said I know
[58:58] hallelujah
[58:59] not that I'm hoping I know my Redeemer
[59:04] liveth see when you know something
[59:07] nobody can take it from you
[59:08] no science no mathematic books no
[59:11] teachers no preacher no nothing when you
[59:14] know and he said you will know in that
[59:17] day that I am in the father the father's
[59:20] in me and I am in you you will know not
[59:24] that you're hoping you will now because
[59:28] your trials have brought you there yep
[59:30] you're crying out has brought you there
[59:33] hallelujah sometimes God has to let them
[59:35] get to us amen because we won't we won't
[59:38] cry out for the holy good we won't cry
[59:40] out to be saving two troubles here Oh
[59:41] sometimes he said why does God
[59:48] trouble come God harnesses trouble and
[59:52] put bits in the mouth and make it obey
[59:55] him and those troubles bring us into a
[59:59] closer fellowship with God hello
[1:00:06] he may even let the devil come and
[1:00:08] nipple you love me pull him back that's
[1:00:12] enough he'll put you out there you might
[1:00:17] feel a little pain but the devil can
[1:00:19] never destroy you don't you understand
[1:00:22] you are the reason mother Caesar cavalry
[1:00:26] was for you he died for you God so loved
[1:00:31] the world he loved you not this chaotic
[1:00:36] world
[1:00:37] he loved his world but you was in this
[1:00:40] world and he said father let them be in
[1:00:43] the world but not of the world he
[1:00:50] brought the whole thing for you but you
[1:00:54] and I must be like him for in here in
[1:00:57] him we live in him move and have our
[1:00:59] being and we certainly as they say we
[1:01:03] are the offspring of God hallelujah I
[1:01:08] was thinking about grapes I love grapes
[1:01:10] oh this is the grape season so I've been
[1:01:13] going to get me some grapes and I got a
[1:01:15] few of them in the freezer I like I'm
[1:01:16] frozen sometimes I think I think our
[1:01:18] sister told me about the frozen grapes
[1:01:20] first you know it is good so I tried the
[1:01:26] frozen grapes and they're delicious I
[1:01:27] eat them frozen and unfrozen but you
[1:01:31] know what's so bad so what a wonderful
[1:01:33] about it they're sweet when they when
[1:01:36] they're warm but they're sweeter when
[1:01:38] they're cold I don't understand that
[1:01:40] but it's so nice a mint just a plunging
[1:01:45] and one thing I know about grades and
[1:01:48] I'm going down we get to my point
[1:01:49] you know when you you have a stack of
[1:01:52] grapes that look like a pyramid upside
[1:01:53] down you know how they like that but you
[1:01:55] got them like this and you know they got
[1:01:57] one at the end and then they all branch
[1:01:59] out but if you set them up like that
[1:02:01] it's like
[1:02:01] capstone and God uses those grapes you
[1:02:04] know for wine and you know and
[1:02:06] stimulation and grapes is a beautiful
[1:02:09] thing because if you taste one off of
[1:02:11] that bunch and it's good all the rest
[1:02:14] are it's good it's the truth it's not
[1:02:20] like that with strawberries you can get
[1:02:22] a batch of strawberries and one might be
[1:02:24] good and all the rest of us our but they
[1:02:27] are strawberries but you see what it is
[1:02:29] they are on the same vine and if the
[1:02:33] original is sweet everything that comes
[1:02:36] out of it is sweet is it true you know I
[1:02:45] must make me sure you know that's you
[1:02:48] know David was saying you know he you
[1:02:49] know though I walk through the valley
[1:02:51] and shadowed us afternoon
[1:02:53] anyway I go back to this you know we
[1:02:56] must understand that this nature of God
[1:03:00] you know I I love God so much and I
[1:03:03] can't explain it I just I told a lot of
[1:03:06] the Lord all the time I just don't want
[1:03:08] to say these things i I want this life
[1:03:11] of love to express itself to me you know
[1:03:13] it's one thing to say it you know man
[1:03:17] you know how we guilty of that you know
[1:03:19] we don't say it to the wife and now we
[1:03:21] just figure because we give her this and
[1:03:23] give her that and Dada Dada Dada Amen
[1:03:25] it's okay and she owes you we assume oh
[1:03:27] she she knows I love her but that ain't
[1:03:30] the way a woman is a woman likes to hear
[1:03:33] it but she know how that I've heard now
[1:03:37] she wants you to say it young men who
[1:03:42] are not married yet you better listen up
[1:03:44] I'm giving you a lesson you better learn
[1:03:48] how to say it and if you don't know how
[1:03:50] to say it you better learn how to touch
[1:03:52] with the hand of love hallelujah y'all
[1:03:55] know no same when you're going through
[1:03:56] something that and God see it sometimes
[1:03:58] he just come in touch doesn't say a word
[1:04:01] then sometime through the scripture or
[1:04:03] through the preaching he tells you and
[1:04:04] you catch it with no one else catching
[1:04:06] it right Amen it's just you need to hear
[1:04:09] I love you everybody the probably God
[1:04:12] said the whole world is dying for love
[1:04:15] uh-huh and you and I must realize by
[1:04:18] God's grace we are designed for love
[1:04:21] we're designed to receive it and we
[1:04:23] designed to give it out that's whatever
[1:04:25] he that's what broke it they were in
[1:04:30] unity they were in harmony they were in
[1:04:32] love that's all he knew it was after the
[1:04:37] fall they experienced what hatred was
[1:04:40] they saw it manifest through their sons
[1:04:44] how Cain killed Abel and those kind of
[1:04:48] things they saw what hatred did with
[1:04:51] animals people and now God has come back
[1:04:56] to restore his nature that was the whole
[1:04:59] cavalry thing it was all it was to make
[1:05:02] a perpetuation of cleansing are you know
[1:05:04] a way of getting the nature of God back
[1:05:07] to his people see that's what makes the
[1:05:12] see live his nature and you and I must
[1:05:15] understand we can't we can't allow
[1:05:18] ourselves to come short of it hello
[1:05:22] I'm not saying you ain't saving like I
[1:05:24] said if we're gonna make a rapture we're
[1:05:26] gonna need the nature of God hallelujah
[1:05:30] now I'm a closed because I said I want
[1:05:33] to be long and I probably went a little
[1:05:34] longer than I thought but I want you to
[1:05:37] understand when we talk about Peter
[1:05:40] grace be unto you Crais and peace be
[1:05:42] multiplied unto you through the
[1:05:43] knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:45] Christ according as his divine power has
[1:05:47] given unto us all things that pertain
[1:05:49] unto life and godliness through the
[1:05:52] knowledge of him that have called us to
[1:05:54] glory and virtue now we can go all the
[1:05:57] way down there we know what it says but
[1:05:59] the scripture said if these things be in
[1:06:02] you huh that you will never fail huh
[1:06:09] you'll never be failed it goes on say
[1:06:12] Dillons you to make your calling and
[1:06:14] election sure that's how you make your
[1:06:17] election sure when divine law has come
[1:06:20] and it's now on display cuz that is the
[1:06:24] token God so
[1:06:26] of the world what did he do he bought
[1:06:28] with love up in Jesus don't you know
[1:06:32] Jesus had the power to wreck the world
[1:06:34] he could have done whatever he wanted to
[1:06:36] do but he protected the people by
[1:06:40] keeping his mouth shut
[1:06:41] either when he went to the slaughter
[1:06:44] Amen then beating on him and slapping
[1:06:46] him and spitting on him and everything
[1:06:47] else the Bible said he opened not his
[1:06:49] mouth
[1:06:51] nature of God divine nature of God well
[1:06:55] I'm gonna tell them a thing or two I'm
[1:06:57] gonna give them a piece of my mind don't
[1:07:02] we do it we get our attitude and the
[1:07:04] Holy Spirit go you're not there yet
[1:07:07] and we think to ourselves like the world
[1:07:10] says up there get over it well they
[1:07:13] might but you won't until you make it
[1:07:16] right you won't get over it and that
[1:07:20] thing laying there will bring you to a
[1:07:23] complete death if you don't uproot it
[1:07:26] I'm almost done is this okay whew I'm
[1:07:38] just gonna I'm gonna stop but I want you
[1:07:41] to understand there's a there's a
[1:07:43] creation there's a place that only those
[1:07:49] who come into the divine nature will go
[1:07:52] nothing that will defile the city no
[1:07:55] unclean thing is entering therein and if
[1:07:57] you don't get clean here you're surely
[1:07:59] not going there what this creation
[1:08:02] that's going on in you like this
[1:08:03] physical creation it brought you where
[1:08:06] to this dimension and if there's a
[1:08:08] spiritual spiritual creation going on to
[1:08:11] you in you now where is it going to take
[1:08:12] you to a world that's spiritual
[1:08:15] all right but if this is all you have it
[1:08:19] bought this this this body basically was
[1:08:22] born in hell
[1:08:23] hello because this is what this world is
[1:08:26] and and the more the longer Christ
[1:08:31] carries the probably God said hell is
[1:08:34] blending into Earth that's why we see
[1:08:37] all the demonic powers that's why we see
[1:08:39] people going insane
[1:08:40] insanity is nothing but Devils mmm
[1:08:45] Legion said it and look at all the naked
[1:08:47] people you can't tell me that these
[1:08:49] people don't have legions it's the truth
[1:08:53] and my thing is this and then if they're
[1:08:55] susceptible if they can they can pull or
[1:08:58] allow them demons to come into them and
[1:09:00] express themselves why are we having
[1:09:02] such a hard time with the Holy Ghost we
[1:09:09] don't want to die we're fighting to live
[1:09:17] but the Bible said if you save your life
[1:09:20] you die if you think your life here is
[1:09:25] worth more than the life to come you do
[1:09:28] everything you could do to save it but
[1:09:31] the man who's willing to give up this
[1:09:33] life to obtain that one he'll make it
[1:09:38] let's not be fool
[1:09:40] people are dying every day and if the
[1:09:42] Lord tarry you and I gonna die and you
[1:09:45] do not want to go down unprepared now
[1:09:50] it's the time of salvation
[1:09:53] stop stop thinking you know you dissin
[1:09:56] that and you can't just treat me in a
[1:09:57] kind of way they did it to Jesus Jesus
[1:09:59] said if they did it in the green tree
[1:10:01] they gonna do it in the dry you think
[1:10:04] you're gonna get out of being persecuted
[1:10:05] and treat it wrong and you know you're
[1:10:08] taking a stand don't compromise now you
[1:10:10] got to stand on the word when you
[1:10:14] compromise you fail the test you got to
[1:10:18] start all over again wherever the where
[1:10:20] the weakest link is that's where the
[1:10:22] chain break is that word
[1:10:26] let's tan People of God it's not a
[1:10:28] fussing I'm saying if you're gonna hear
[1:10:31] the word if you're gonna be the word
[1:10:32] let's go forward give everything you got
[1:10:35] amen to live like I heard somebody say
[1:10:38] I'm dying to live and I can just die to
[1:10:44] live I'll be okay because this flesh do
[1:10:48] not want to die it fights you right you
[1:10:56] understand me when somebody do you wrong
[1:10:58] that that fresh kid you see that beast
[1:11:03] you see you mighty may not say none to
[1:11:08] you but just get upset like I told you
[1:11:11] the other day itself whatsoever it
[1:11:14] whatsoever exalt whosoever was sort of
[1:11:17] exalt itself that itself is a demon
[1:11:20] against the Word of God itself was
[1:11:23] Lucifer amen in heaven itself was
[1:11:27] Lucifer or or the serpent in the Garden
[1:11:30] of Eden itself because it's so spiritual
[1:11:33] now it's a spiritual warfare in the mind
[1:11:35] itself stays on your left side and
[1:11:38] Christ on the right you've seen the
[1:11:40] cartoons the devil on one side telling
[1:11:43] you the bad things to doing God on the
[1:11:45] other side with the halo around his head
[1:11:47] saying don't do it that's your battle
[1:11:49] and guess what it's greater than the
[1:11:52] Battle of Jericho it's greater than the
[1:11:56] battle that they had in Egypt it's
[1:11:58] greater than any of the battles they
[1:12:00] ever had in a New Testament because they
[1:12:03] could see their enemy and fight
