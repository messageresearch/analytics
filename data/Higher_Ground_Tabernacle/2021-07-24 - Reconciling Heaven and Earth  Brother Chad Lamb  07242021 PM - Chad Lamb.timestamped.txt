[44:27] surprises i don't like
[44:29] but i really appreciate them being here
[44:31] and i'm thankful that we could be
[44:33] together and look into god's word i'm
[44:34] thankful we have a word to look at today
[44:37] and we're not taking our own mind and
[44:39] our own understanding and
[44:41] one of 40 000 versions in christianity
[44:44] but
[44:44] god has taken us back to his original
[44:46] thought amen
[44:47] what he wanted in his word what his
[44:49] original desire and his original plan
[44:51] was
[44:52] he's brought us back to that so that we
[44:54] know what he expects of us today and
[44:56] what he's looking for
[44:57] and what we ought to be doing and we
[44:59] thank god for that it's a privilege
[45:01] friends
[45:03] so today i'd like to uh share just a
[45:05] thought with you
[45:06] on reconciling heaven and earth and i'd
[45:09] like to begin in the book of revelation
[45:11] if you'd like to turn there with me
[45:13] to revelation chapter 12. we'll read
[45:16] from there
[45:18] also my heart was heavy all day i was
[45:21] grieved and in tears
[45:23] as i learned of the passing of our
[45:24] brother stephen francis
[45:26] brother stephen was a very very dear
[45:28] friend of mine
[45:30] and it's been a tough day i know it has
[45:32] been for brother isaiah as well as
[45:33] myself
[45:35] and i was heartbroken but brother
[45:37] stephen was a wonderful brother
[45:40] he's one of the finest brothers i've
[45:42] ever known
[45:43] in this earth and uh
[45:47] i wasn't ready to think of him not being
[45:50] on this earth anymore
[45:51] i wasn't prepared for that i thought the
[45:53] lord would raise him up
[45:54] i've been praying so and it came as
[45:56] quite a blow
[45:58] but he's gone on to his reward and i'm
[46:01] thankful that he's in the sixth
[46:03] dimension rejoicing
[46:05] those that have gone before and he's
[46:06] better off than we are
[46:09] but because of that you know i've been
[46:11] meditating on that and
[46:13] really struggling with that all day but
[46:16] i'd like to dedicate this service to the
[46:18] lord jesus christ
[46:19] but i'd like to do so in honor of
[46:21] brother stephen francis
[46:23] because he's run his race he's finished
[46:25] his course he fought the good fight
[46:27] and he did it faithfully to the end in
[46:30] the end he was preaching
[46:32] every day over whatsapp to his
[46:34] congregation
[46:35] because they were shut down all the way
[46:36] until he got sick every day he was
[46:38] bringing a message
[46:40] and i said god bless him and he can't
[46:43] run anymore and he can't preach any more
[46:45] on this earth he can't do
[46:47] any more but now we can
[46:50] we can press on and i intend to do so
[46:52] with all that's in me more so than ever
[46:55] to bring honor to my brother for he was
[46:57] a great influence in my life
[46:58] and a great encourager to me in the
[47:00] ministry and so he'll be greatly missed
[47:03] but i want to i just want to honor him
[47:07] i want to honor our lord and continue to
[47:09] serve our master
[47:12] let's look together at revelation
[47:13] chapter 12
[47:15] verse 3.
[47:18] and there appeared another wonder in
[47:20] heaven and behold a great red dragon
[47:22] having seven heads
[47:23] and ten horns and seven crowns upon his
[47:26] head
[47:27] and his tail drew the third part of the
[47:29] stars of heaven and did cast him to the
[47:30] earth
[47:31] and the dragon stood before the woman
[47:33] which was ready to be delivered for to
[47:35] devour her child
[47:36] as soon as it was born and let's bow our
[47:39] heads and ask the lord to bless the
[47:41] reading of his word
[47:43] dear lord jesus we thank you father for
[47:45] the privilege to come to you once again
[47:48] to gather together with the saints of
[47:50] like precious faith lord we're just
[47:52] asking lord that you would do what no
[47:54] man can do
[47:56] for through through a gift of education
[47:58] and literacy we can open a bible and
[48:00] read the words that are in our language
[48:02] but god without you we can have no
[48:04] revelation
[48:06] god we're not looking for understanding
[48:08] that comes from education
[48:09] we're coming looking for revelation that
[48:11] comes from you our father
[48:13] for you are the only source of
[48:15] revelation and god i pray that as we
[48:18] look into this word that you would open
[48:19] our eyes of understanding that we might
[48:21] see what it is you want us to see in
[48:23] this day
[48:24] and we might understand what it is
[48:25] you've given for us to understand in
[48:27] this day
[48:28] that we might run this race with
[48:30] patience that's set before us
[48:32] god i pray that you would bless us now
[48:34] as we look into your word may you have
[48:36] preeminence over everything that's done
[48:38] in every word that's spoken
[48:40] may all that we do bring glory and honor
[48:42] to your name in jesus christ's name we
[48:44] pray
[48:45] amen you can be seated
[48:49] so we look at this subject uh
[48:52] of reconciling heaven and earth and
[48:54] we're going to be looking at some of
[48:56] these things brother benham said and
[48:58] and it looks like it may be a deep
[48:59] subject but it's not a deep subject it's
[49:01] very
[49:02] very simple so don't don't get lost and
[49:04] think
[49:05] we're going to go deep we're not going
[49:06] to go deep we're going to stay where all
[49:08] of us live amen
[49:09] this is about living the word this is
[49:11] about living the word today
[49:14] and brother branham tells us in 1954 in
[49:17] a message questions and answers
[49:19] he says you know what that was now his
[49:21] tale wasn't like a fork tale
[49:24] like they say the devil was god it was
[49:26] the tale t-a-l-e
[49:28] the lie that he told amen but the man
[49:31] was telling us it wasn't the dragon's
[49:33] tale
[49:33] amen everything in revelation is
[49:35] symbolic because revelation is a book of
[49:38] symbols
[49:39] so that we know that the red dragon
[49:40] represents satan and we know the red
[49:42] dragon
[49:43] also represents rome amen because
[49:45] everything in here is symbolic
[49:47] and he said he grabbed the with his tail
[49:49] he drew a third part of the stars of
[49:50] heaven and then cast him to the earth
[49:52] and brother branham was saying not a
[49:53] tail like his tail like a physical tail
[49:56] but a tail
[49:57] the lie that he told the story that he
[49:59] told
[50:00] amen because we know that what happened
[50:02] in eden was a reflection of what
[50:04] happened in heaven
[50:06] so it was the lie that he told and it
[50:08] brought a deception
[50:10] in so much that there was a dis he
[50:12] deceived the angels in heaven
[50:13] that were in the very presence of god so
[50:16] it was a it was a deception and it was a
[50:18] very
[50:18] uh slippery deception to deceive those
[50:21] angels
[50:22] and he says brother says in the message
[50:25] that day on calvary
[50:26] and sin did not start on earth so we
[50:29] don't say
[50:30] amen we say the original sin and brother
[50:33] bennett used that term the original sin
[50:35] you know because of what took place in
[50:37] the garden of eden that was the original
[50:39] sin upon
[50:40] earth after the re-creation in genesis 1
[50:42] 2
[50:43] that was the original sin on earth but
[50:45] the original sin took place in heaven
[50:49] so sin did not start on the earth sin
[50:51] started in heaven
[50:53] lucifer the devil was a condemned
[50:55] creature for his disobedience before he
[50:56] ever struck the earth
[50:58] sin began in heaven where god put the
[51:00] angels and so forth
[51:01] upon the same basis that he put human
[51:03] beings on knowledge the tree of
[51:05] knowledge the tree of life
[51:07] and the tree of knowledge where man
[51:08] could take his choice and when lucifer
[51:10] was given the preeminence to make his
[51:12] choice
[51:12] he wanted something better than god had
[51:15] that started the trouble
[51:18] what started the trouble he wanted
[51:20] something better
[51:21] he wasn't content with what god had gave
[51:23] him and wasn't content with god's
[51:25] kingdom
[51:25] amen he wanted something better let's go
[51:28] on in revelations chapter 12 and move
[51:30] down to verse 7.
[51:32] revelation 12 and 7 it says and there
[51:34] was war in heaven michael and his angels
[51:36] fought against the dragon
[51:38] and the dragon fought in his angels and
[51:40] prevailed not
[51:41] neither was their place found any more
[51:43] in heaven and the great dragon was cast
[51:46] out that old serpent called the devil
[51:48] and satan
[51:49] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[51:51] cast out into the earth and his angels
[51:53] were cast out
[51:54] with him and i heard a loud voice saying
[51:56] in heaven now has come
[51:58] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[52:00] of our god and the power of his christ
[52:02] for the accuser of our brotherness cast
[52:04] down which accused them before our god
[52:07] day and night and they overcame him by
[52:09] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[52:11] their testimony
[52:12] and they love not their lives unto death
[52:17] so we're going to look at this brother
[52:18] bam tells us this is a prophecy that
[52:21] will take place in the future
[52:23] when when lucifer the dragon
[52:26] the devil the serpent will be cast out
[52:28] of heaven
[52:30] and he'll come down to the earth and
[52:31] he'll incarnate the beast
[52:33] amen in the tribulation period we know
[52:35] that but this is also something that
[52:37] took place in the past
[52:39] he told us in the greatest battle ever
[52:41] fought
[52:42] he said this great first battle that was
[52:44] ever fought begin in heaven when michael
[52:46] and his angels fought against lucifer
[52:48] and his angels
[52:49] it first started the first battle was in
[52:51] heaven
[52:52] so sin did not originate on earth it
[52:54] originated in heaven
[52:56] this is the thing we want to lock in a
[52:58] prophet of god amen a prophet
[53:00] of god took us way back amen to the
[53:02] beginning
[53:03] and he took us way all the way to the
[53:05] end because with eagle vision he was
[53:07] able to lift up
[53:08] out of the natural and show us all the
[53:10] way back into the back part of god's
[53:12] mind
[53:12] when there was nothing amen when nothing
[53:15] existed
[53:15] when god dwelt alone and he wasn't even
[53:18] god yet he was the almighty he was
[53:20] elohim because god is an object of
[53:21] worship
[53:22] and there was nothing to worship him do
[53:24] you realize how privileged the people we
[53:26] are that through prophetic eyes amen if
[53:29] we just have faith in that and by
[53:31] revelation
[53:32] we can look back into the back part of
[53:34] god's mind
[53:35] from before the foundation world before
[53:37] the first creation of stardust
[53:39] or molecules or atoms or protons or
[53:41] neutrons before there is anything
[53:43] we can look back and say there was
[53:44] elohim with this thought and beyond that
[53:47] by revelation i could say i was there
[53:49] then
[53:52] and then we look all the way down to the
[53:55] end amen
[53:56] when the new heavens and the new earth
[53:57] come and heaven and earth unite
[53:59] amen and we can say i was there then and
[54:01] i will be there then amen
[54:04] and so what i'm doing now is playing out
[54:06] my part of the drama
[54:07] what i'm doing now god had in his mind
[54:10] something he wanted to achieve
[54:11] a goal a purpose and brother bam tells
[54:14] us in christ the mystery of god revealed
[54:16] that this whole bible is expressing one
[54:19] goal that god had
[54:20] one purpose one thing he wanted to
[54:22] achieve and every
[54:24] character and every time amen was a
[54:26] foreshadow was typing out
[54:27] showing the great story of god the one
[54:30] thing god wanted to achieve
[54:33] and now we're here as part of that one
[54:36] goal that one purpose
[54:39] that thing that he wanted to achieve
[54:42] it's important for us to keep focused on
[54:44] what god wants
[54:46] because it's so easy for us to get
[54:48] distracted with what we want
[54:51] and we take our journey in this life
[54:54] that may be
[54:54] 60 70 80 years amen if we're fortunate
[54:58] maybe 90 years
[55:00] and we take this journey in life and we
[55:02] become consumed
[55:04] with what we can attain and what goals
[55:06] we have for ourselves and
[55:07] what we can accomplish and what we can
[55:09] achieve i mean by doing so we can miss
[55:12] the whole purpose amen
[55:13] because when i was there as an attribute
[55:15] of god there was a plan that was formed
[55:17] in god's mind
[55:18] and i was part of that plan and i'm not
[55:20] here to take my
[55:21] own natural mind but i'm here to tap
[55:24] back into that original purpose
[55:26] for me being an attribute of god to
[55:28] display my part of the one goal
[55:30] the one thing he wanted to achieve and
[55:32] he's come to the final days of that
[55:34] achieving
[55:35] he's going to meet his goal but he's
[55:37] going to use you and i to do it
[55:39] and we've got to tune back in we've got
[55:41] to dial ourselves spiritually back in
[55:43] with the original purpose and the
[55:46] enemy's constantly trying to get us out
[55:48] of tune
[55:51] he'll bring every mechanism along to get
[55:53] us to move out of tune
[55:55] but why is it we continually listen to
[55:57] those tapes and read the book and
[55:59] stay in prayer and come to fellowship
[56:01] why are we doing this all the time to
[56:03] stay dialed in
[56:04] to stay tuned into god's one purpose
[56:09] he said the we're still in greatest
[56:11] battle ever fought he said as the first
[56:13] started the first battle was in heaven
[56:15] so sin did not originate on earth that
[56:17] originated in heaven
[56:19] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[56:21] cast out of heaven to the earth
[56:23] and fell on human beings
[56:26] then the battle from angels became human
[56:29] battles
[56:31] so the battle that started in heaven and
[56:33] the sin originated in heaven
[56:35] continues on today
[56:38] it's a war the first blow
[56:41] the first battle that started the first
[56:44] shot that was fired
[56:46] was fired by lucifer in heaven and that
[56:49] was the first
[56:49] battle but the war continues on and the
[56:52] battle that started in angels has now
[56:54] moved down into humans
[56:56] and it's the same fight that's going on
[56:58] today that started then
[57:00] and now the fight listen he says became
[57:02] human battles
[57:04] and satan came to destroy god's creation
[57:06] what god had created to be for himself
[57:09] he had satan came to destroy this that's
[57:13] what his purpose was was to destroy it
[57:15] then the battle begin here on earth and
[57:17] begin
[57:18] in us it has been raging
[57:23] ever since so now where is the
[57:26] battleground
[57:28] i am the battleground that's why
[57:30] sometimes you feel like you're at war in
[57:32] your mind you are at war in your mind
[57:35] because the greatest battle ever fought
[57:37] is being fought in the mind of man
[57:39] what started in the heavenly realm has
[57:40] now come down to earth
[57:42] what started in angels and now come to
[57:44] human beings and now
[57:45] is raging in us
[57:50] see it's important to realize these
[57:51] things that we're going to be tripped up
[57:52] by our life we're not going to
[57:54] understand
[57:54] why bad things are happening and why
[57:57] challenges are coming and why so many
[57:59] obstacles why are there so many
[58:00] obstacles to overcome
[58:02] if i'm a child of god and god i'm the
[58:04] beloved and i'm his bride and he loves
[58:06] me so much and cares for me
[58:07] why such hardship why such difficulty
[58:10] why do i suffer with everything else
[58:12] everybody else in the world suffers with
[58:14] amen because there's a battle going on
[58:17] and that battle is over the word of god
[58:19] and god is proving his word amen and to
[58:22] prove his word he's got to show
[58:24] that this word will overcome everything
[58:26] the devil has amen
[58:27] every defilement every perversion every
[58:30] sickness
[58:31] every disease i mean everything that he
[58:34] can possibly do
[58:35] in his perverted state to throw at you
[58:37] to trip you down
[58:38] there has to be a word that will
[58:40] overcome that to prove that god is
[58:42] victorious over his enemy
[58:45] and if we don't understand what's going
[58:46] on god is proving his word
[58:48] and the battle is in us and we don't
[58:50] understand what's happening amen what's
[58:52] happening is faith is being challenged
[58:54] because faith can rise to the occasion
[58:56] amen if we don't understand what those
[59:00] challenges are
[59:02] we get so distraught and we get
[59:04] depressed
[59:05] and we begin to doubt our salvation and
[59:08] we begin to doubt
[59:09] our brideship and our sonship and we we
[59:11] begin to falter in our mind
[59:13] and it's just because we have
[59:14] unrealistic expectations of what it
[59:16] means to be the bride
[59:20] remember brother branham said when they
[59:21] asked the question in malachi
[59:24] how did you love us when has you have
[59:26] you loved us he said they didn't
[59:28] understand the love of god
[59:30] they thought the love was parental care
[59:32] a baby in the arms
[59:33] of its parent nothing will harm it and
[59:35] he says they didn't understand his love
[59:37] his love is elective love
[59:38] how do i know he loved me because he
[59:40] told me so
[59:42] and because i have the capacity to
[59:44] believe his word
[59:45] i believe he loves me amen on my worst
[59:48] day he loves me when everything goes
[59:49] wrong he loves me when i lose
[59:51] my job and somebody stole my identity
[59:53] and wiped out my account
[59:55] he still loves me i'm not putting that
[59:57] in question because my feelings go up
[59:59] and down i'm not questioning his word
[1:00:01] his words as he loves me
[1:00:02] he chose me and i'm sticking with his
[1:00:05] word no matter what the obstacles are
[1:00:07] see that's what the battle's over the
[1:00:09] battle's over the word
[1:00:12] and the battle is raging in you
[1:00:16] so the next time something dreadful
[1:00:17] happens in your life
[1:00:20] quit throwing away your sonship quit
[1:00:23] doubting whether god loves you
[1:00:24] quit going back and saying what did i do
[1:00:26] wrong why is he punishing me he wasn't
[1:00:28] punishing job
[1:00:29] he was proving job amen he was proving
[1:00:32] his word through job
[1:00:33] there was not a punishment it was giving
[1:00:36] us he was giving his son a greater
[1:00:37] revelation
[1:00:38] and he was proving to the devil that
[1:00:40] there's one on earth that's not going to
[1:00:41] fall
[1:00:42] by your attack today so when things
[1:00:45] happen in life
[1:00:46] don't throw away all the ground that
[1:00:49] we've gained but realize
[1:00:50] there's an obstacle coming because
[1:00:52] there's a word that's going to overcome
[1:00:54] that obstacle
[1:00:55] god is going to meet the challenge and
[1:00:57] god will overcome the challenge
[1:00:59] if i will just stick with his word
[1:01:01] confess his word
[1:01:02] he will come and back up his word and he
[1:01:05] will prove that he is mightier than
[1:01:07] whatever this is
[1:01:10] so we have to trust the word of god
[1:01:13] because this is what the battle is over
[1:01:16] and the message marriage and divorce
[1:01:20] he said that was then now it was then
[1:01:23] man was made ruler over the woman he's
[1:01:25] going back to the fall
[1:01:26] by god's word she was no more co-equal
[1:01:28] with him she was co-equal in nature
[1:01:31] you know but when she broke god's word
[1:01:33] and made a man to be
[1:01:35] god made a man to be a ruler over her
[1:01:37] genesis 3 16 if you want to put it down
[1:01:39] she was no more equal with man she was
[1:01:41] the breaker of god's word
[1:01:43] don't you see she she the church down
[1:01:45] here
[1:01:46] the breaker of god's word that throwed
[1:01:48] her completely out of continuity
[1:01:50] and that's what the church has done is
[1:01:51] throw the spiritual death upon the whole
[1:01:53] thing
[1:01:55] now you understand why i hammer at these
[1:01:56] things like i do it's the truth this is
[1:01:58] bible facts
[1:02:00] then i'm going to skip down to paragraph
[1:02:02] 101 notice why did she do such a thing
[1:02:05] being in that high order she was right
[1:02:07] with man co-equal with him but
[1:02:09] we all know now that she lost her
[1:02:12] co-equalness with man when she sinned
[1:02:14] and god said man will be your ruler from
[1:02:16] here out now that's the scripture if you
[1:02:18] want
[1:02:19] if you want to we could read it skip
[1:02:21] down the paragraph 103.
[1:02:23] notice the reason she did that how did
[1:02:25] satan ever get to her
[1:02:27] verse 104 now he's going to make an
[1:02:29] interesting statement
[1:02:30] did you know satan was co-equal with god
[1:02:32] one day
[1:02:34] sure was all but a creator
[1:02:37] he was everything stood at the right
[1:02:39] hand of god in heaven the great
[1:02:41] leading cherubim brother
[1:02:44] it's like he just throws this in he does
[1:02:47] that a lot
[1:02:49] he's going along talking about the fall
[1:02:51] and how she was in a high state
[1:02:54] she was co-equal with man she was adam
[1:03:00] remember she did not get a name eve
[1:03:03] until after she committed adultery
[1:03:05] eve is her name of adultery that's why
[1:03:07] when brother brennan would come and
[1:03:09] preach blasphemous names
[1:03:10] showing all these churches taking a name
[1:03:13] shows that they are in adultery they're
[1:03:15] taking their own idea their own
[1:03:17] denominational name
[1:03:18] because eve didn't have a name in
[1:03:20] genesis 5 it says when he created adam
[1:03:23] he created him male and female
[1:03:25] and called their name adam
[1:03:28] so when god would come walking in the
[1:03:30] cool of the evening and he would cry
[1:03:32] if he wanted the male he would call adam
[1:03:35] and the male would run but when he
[1:03:38] wanted the female
[1:03:39] he would call adam and the female would
[1:03:42] rhyme because there was not two names
[1:03:44] there was one name there was not two
[1:03:45] beings in god's eye
[1:03:47] we look and see two but god saw one amen
[1:03:50] because they were one in the original
[1:03:52] and he pulled it out
[1:03:53] and brought them back together in the
[1:03:55] first marriage union that was ever on
[1:03:56] earth
[1:03:57] and he called their name adam to god
[1:04:00] they were one
[1:04:03] that was why the sin was such a horrible
[1:04:05] thing that divided the unity of the man
[1:04:07] and his wife
[1:04:09] because god saw them as one and after
[1:04:12] she was with child she had committed
[1:04:14] adultery
[1:04:15] after the fall adam called her name eve
[1:04:18] the mother of all living it's not a name
[1:04:20] to be proud of
[1:04:23] it shows her adultery
[1:04:27] god's taking this fall and her now
[1:04:30] falling from a state of co-equalness now
[1:04:33] and
[1:04:33] and by failing to keep the word now
[1:04:36] she's put under the headship of man
[1:04:39] and go brother brendan when he's
[1:04:41] preaching this he throws in there do you
[1:04:43] know
[1:04:43] satan was co-equal with man one with god
[1:04:46] one day
[1:04:48] all but a creator he was everything but
[1:04:49] a creator he could not create
[1:04:52] but satan lost his position because he
[1:04:56] rebelled against the word of god
[1:04:58] and brother ben was showing us that this
[1:05:00] fallen eden is a reflection of a fall in
[1:05:03] heaven
[1:05:04] there was first a fall in heaven which
[1:05:06] one fell
[1:05:08] god's right hand man the one that was
[1:05:10] co-equal to him a covering cherubim that
[1:05:12] was here
[1:05:13] covering his shekinah glory one of the
[1:05:15] greatest angels of all time one of the
[1:05:17] greatest angels
[1:05:18] in the heavenly realm the one that was
[1:05:20] closest to him
[1:05:21] is the one that fallen the same thing
[1:05:23] happened to adam and the eden
[1:05:25] what fell one of the two great beings
[1:05:27] amen one
[1:05:28] the right hand of adam
[1:05:31] fell showing that what's taking place in
[1:05:34] eden
[1:05:36] was a reflection or or shadowed of what
[1:05:38] took place
[1:05:40] in heaven
[1:05:43] see we've come to the day where the
[1:05:45] bride has grown up she's not to be a
[1:05:47] child anymore
[1:05:49] she's not to think like a child she's
[1:05:51] not to have narrow vision they men
[1:05:53] the denominational blinders have been
[1:05:55] taken off so she can see
[1:05:57] the full peripheral and she can
[1:05:59] understand why things are the way they
[1:06:01] are in this day
[1:06:02] why we're in the condition that we're in
[1:06:05] and what it's going to take to get out
[1:06:06] of this condition
[1:06:09] so we thank god for that brother ben
[1:06:12] said do you know
[1:06:14] what caused the first battle in heaven
[1:06:16] was when lucifer set up a greater class
[1:06:18] of people got a better class of angels
[1:06:21] he thought a big a a big bigger kingdom
[1:06:24] a more brighter shinier kingdom than
[1:06:26] michael had
[1:06:27] and he was kicked out of heaven so
[1:06:30] lucifer
[1:06:31] wanted big bright shiny great
[1:06:36] and you have to imagine what was the
[1:06:38] kingdom of michael like
[1:06:41] god was reflecting himself in an angelic
[1:06:43] being a michael
[1:06:44] which was a pre-figure of christ the
[1:06:46] type of christ in the angelic form
[1:06:48] and he had a kingdom but lucifer thought
[1:06:51] that he could have a better kingdom
[1:06:54] if lucifer thought you'd have a better
[1:06:56] kingdom what does that tell you about
[1:06:59] the kingdom of michael the kingdom of
[1:07:01] christ
[1:07:02] it must have not been the greatest most
[1:07:05] beautiful
[1:07:06] visually attractive maybe it was humble
[1:07:11] maybe it was like when christ come to
[1:07:13] earth he was humble
[1:07:15] maybe lucifer something in lucifer when
[1:07:18] he looked at that he said i can do
[1:07:20] better
[1:07:22] he looked at what god had created and he
[1:07:24] thought that he could do better
[1:07:25] that he could have brighter there could
[1:07:27] be a greater splendor
[1:07:28] amen they're god it goes to show
[1:07:32] god amen when he was in the kingdom of
[1:07:35] michael
[1:07:36] didn't produce the greatest splendor
[1:07:37] that he could ever produce
[1:07:39] because god is known in humility
[1:07:42] christ is understood through humility
[1:07:45] let's turn to ezekiel 28
[1:07:48] and look at this scripture together
[1:07:54] ezekiel 28 and verse 11 we're going to
[1:07:58] look at a description of lucifer
[1:08:05] ezekiel 28 11. moreover the word of the
[1:08:08] lord came unto me saying son of man take
[1:08:10] up a lamentation against the king of
[1:08:12] tyrus
[1:08:13] and say unto him thus saith the lord god
[1:08:15] thou sealest up the sum
[1:08:17] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[1:08:20] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[1:08:23] we know he's taking the lamentation
[1:08:25] against the king of tyrus
[1:08:26] but he's actually showing in type the
[1:08:28] spirit behind the king of tyres which is
[1:08:30] the spirit of the devil
[1:08:31] the spirit of lucifer and so he's
[1:08:33] calling them out
[1:08:34] he says thou seelest up the sum
[1:08:39] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[1:08:44] that's why when we have little childish
[1:08:46] images of the devil with
[1:08:47] a fork stick and red and ugly with
[1:08:51] with horns out of his head that that is
[1:08:53] the exact
[1:08:54] the deception that the devil wants you
[1:08:56] to take he wants you to think that he's
[1:08:59] nasty ugly filthy
[1:09:02] all of these things but when god
[1:09:04] describes him
[1:09:05] he doesn't describe any other being in
[1:09:08] creation the way that he describes this
[1:09:10] angel
[1:09:12] thou sealest up the sum that means you
[1:09:14] have everything
[1:09:17] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[1:09:22] brother bram said it's not the farmer
[1:09:23] with bibbed overalls you got to worry
[1:09:24] about with your wife it's that slicker
[1:09:26] that comes in the three-piece suit
[1:09:28] with the gold ring on his pinky that's
[1:09:31] the guy you got to watch
[1:09:34] amen he says now thou has been in eden
[1:09:38] the garden of god
[1:09:39] every precious stone was thy covering
[1:09:41] the sardis the topaz and the diamond the
[1:09:43] barrel
[1:09:44] the onyx the jasper the sapphire the
[1:09:46] emerald carbuncle and gold
[1:09:48] the workmanship of thy tablets of thy
[1:09:50] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[1:09:52] that that was created
[1:09:53] thou art the anointed cherub that
[1:09:54] covereth and i have set thee so
[1:09:56] that was upon the holy mountain of god
[1:09:59] that was walked up and down in the midst
[1:10:00] of the stones of fire that was
[1:10:02] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[1:10:05] thou was created
[1:10:07] to iniquity was found in thee by the
[1:10:09] multitude of thy merchandise they have
[1:10:11] filled the midst of thee with violence
[1:10:13] and thou has sinned
[1:10:14] therefore i will cast this profane out
[1:10:16] of the mountain of god
[1:10:17] and i will destroy the o covering cherub
[1:10:19] from the midst
[1:10:20] of the stones of fire thine heart was
[1:10:22] lifted up because
[1:10:24] of thy beauty
[1:10:28] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[1:10:30] of thy
[1:10:31] brightness i will cast you to the ground
[1:10:34] i will lay thee before kings
[1:10:36] that thou may behold thee thou has
[1:10:38] defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude
[1:10:40] of the
[1:10:41] iniquities by the iniquity of thy
[1:10:43] traffic therefore will i bring forth a
[1:10:45] fire from the midst of thee
[1:10:46] and shall devour thee and i will bring
[1:10:48] thee to ashes upon the earth
[1:10:50] and the sight of all them that behold
[1:10:52] thee
[1:10:55] when god describes lucifer
[1:10:59] it's not the picture that you see in
[1:11:01] your denominational coloring book
[1:11:05] it's always when lucifer has come to
[1:11:08] deceive the children of god
[1:11:10] he's always coming to church
[1:11:13] he's come behind the pulpit
[1:11:16] and he was nice friendly
[1:11:20] good looking that's why i know i'm not
[1:11:24] his agent
[1:11:26] by the time you get done reading this
[1:11:28] slightly below
[1:11:29] average becomes great place to be
[1:11:33] because he was deceived by his own
[1:11:35] brightness he was corrupted by his own
[1:11:37] beauty
[1:11:37] that he was made so perfect amen without
[1:11:40] any flaw
[1:11:41] that he was deceived by his own
[1:11:43] perfection
[1:11:46] and so you could see why a creature like
[1:11:48] this
[1:11:49] could look at the kingdom of michael and
[1:11:51] he could get lifted up within himself
[1:11:53] in pride and arrogancy and he could say
[1:11:55] i can do better than that
[1:11:57] i can have greater than that amen and he
[1:12:00] began to
[1:12:01] play with fire and he was cast out of
[1:12:03] heaven so we know in that great battle
[1:12:05] that lucifer was cast out of heaven
[1:12:07] amen and the question that i've always
[1:12:09] had is when we get to revelation chapter
[1:12:11] 12
[1:12:11] how did he get back in heaven what was
[1:12:14] he doing there because brother balaam
[1:12:15] shows that as a prophecy
[1:12:17] of the end time when he's cast down and
[1:12:19] incarnates the beast and he says when
[1:12:20] the bride goes up
[1:12:22] satan comes down so he was already cast
[1:12:24] out of heaven
[1:12:25] what's he doing back in heaven and it's
[1:12:28] a question that was in my mind
[1:12:30] so i just wanted to spend some time
[1:12:31] looking at that
[1:12:33] brother bam says in the message i will
[1:12:35] restore which i thought was unique it
[1:12:37] was preached here in des moines
[1:12:39] in 1954. i didn't do that on purpose it
[1:12:42] just happened
[1:12:44] and we've noticed that satan in the
[1:12:46] beginning in the original back in the
[1:12:47] initial condition
[1:12:48] he was full of pomp he wouldn't
[1:12:50] something a better kingdom than michael
[1:12:52] so he goes over the north and sets him
[1:12:54] up a kingdom
[1:12:55] greater more beautiful don't you see how
[1:12:58] beauty is deceitful and how our churches
[1:13:00] today are seeing who can build the
[1:13:01] biggest church
[1:13:02] who can make the best pews who can get
[1:13:04] the best dressed crowd the more
[1:13:05] honorable people among the city to come
[1:13:08] that's all of the devil
[1:13:11] you may be angry with me after this but
[1:13:12] when i meet you at judgment you'll know
[1:13:14] that i've spoke to you in the name of
[1:13:15] the lord
[1:13:16] that's right we can't humble ourselves
[1:13:18] anymore we got to have the big the
[1:13:20] refined the best the everything like
[1:13:22] and knowing that those things come from
[1:13:24] satan always has been
[1:13:25] it was in heaven that's the reason he
[1:13:27] was kicked out
[1:13:28] that's what he's doing here on earth
[1:13:30] taking the churches and deceiving them
[1:13:33] god doesn't dwell in big buildings he
[1:13:34] doesn't dwell among the fine dressed
[1:13:36] people he doesn't have to have that
[1:13:38] god wants a humble heart to dwell in
[1:13:42] let's turn to isaiah 53
[1:13:45] and we'll look at a different
[1:13:46] description of another being
[1:13:50] the first description was of lucifer now
[1:13:52] we're going to look at a description of
[1:13:54] the son of god
[1:13:56] isaiah 53 and 1 who hath believed our
[1:14:00] report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:14:01] lord revealed
[1:14:03] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:14:04] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[1:14:06] ground
[1:14:07] he has no form nor comingness and when
[1:14:09] we shall see him there is no beauty
[1:14:11] that we should desire him he is despised
[1:14:15] and rejected of men
[1:14:16] now listen this is not the description
[1:14:18] we read in ezekiel of lucifer
[1:14:20] this is the description of jesus christ
[1:14:24] there's no beauty that we should desire
[1:14:26] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[1:14:28] man of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[1:14:31] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:14:33] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:14:36] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:14:38] carried our
[1:14:39] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:14:42] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[1:14:45] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:14:47] bruised for our iniquities
[1:14:48] the chastisement of our peace is upon
[1:14:50] him and with his stripes we are healed
[1:14:53] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[1:14:56] have turned everyone to his own way and
[1:14:58] the lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[1:15:00] of us all
[1:15:01] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[1:15:03] yet he opened on his mouth
[1:15:04] he was brought as a lamb to the
[1:15:06] slaughter and as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:15:08] and as a sheep before
[1:15:09] shears is dumb so he opened not his
[1:15:11] mouth he was taken from the prison and
[1:15:13] from judgment and who shall declare his
[1:15:15] generation
[1:15:16] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:15:18] the living for the transgression of my
[1:15:20] people was he stricken
[1:15:21] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:15:23] and with the rich and death because he
[1:15:25] had
[1:15:25] he had done no violence neither was any
[1:15:27] deceit in his mouth
[1:15:29] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he
[1:15:31] hath put him to grief when
[1:15:33] thou shalt make his soul and offering
[1:15:35] for sin he shall see a seed he shall
[1:15:37] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[1:15:39] lord shall prosper in his hand
[1:15:41] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[1:15:43] shall be satisfied
[1:15:44] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:15:46] servant justify many
[1:15:48] for he shall bear their iniquity
[1:15:50] therefore will i divide him a portion
[1:15:52] with the great
[1:15:53] and shall divide the spoil with the
[1:15:55] strong because he hath poured out his
[1:15:57] soul unto death
[1:15:58] and he was numbered with the
[1:15:59] transgressors and he bear the sins of
[1:16:01] many
[1:16:02] and made intercession for the
[1:16:04] transgressors
[1:16:07] i'm glad lucifer wasn't sent to take my
[1:16:09] place
[1:16:11] he could never humble himself low enough
[1:16:14] but god himself could come down in flesh
[1:16:16] in his own
[1:16:17] flesh that he created as the son of god
[1:16:19] and he could become so humble
[1:16:21] there was no beauty that we desire him
[1:16:22] there was nothing that would attract men
[1:16:24] to him
[1:16:25] the only thing that was attraction was
[1:16:26] the word amen was the character that he
[1:16:29] had the character that reflected the
[1:16:30] nature of god
[1:16:31] and the word that he brought forth amen
[1:16:34] he had nothing else he had no armies he
[1:16:35] had no wealth he had
[1:16:36] he had no status he had no position he
[1:16:38] had no no comeliness he had nothing
[1:16:42] that would attract men the only thing he
[1:16:43] had was the character of god in the word
[1:16:45] of god
[1:16:46] and we come today and god has showed up
[1:16:49] not in an intellectual giant
[1:16:51] but in a kentucky hillbilly with a
[1:16:52] seventh grade education
[1:16:54] because it matches his nature amen he
[1:16:57] had to get somebody that could humble
[1:16:59] themselves
[1:16:59] somebody that could be broken amen
[1:17:01] somebody that could suffer the
[1:17:03] affliction amen for us
[1:17:04] for you and i brother branham when he
[1:17:07] wouldn't go out with the pentecostals he
[1:17:08] was broken why was he broken
[1:17:10] he was broken because there was a
[1:17:11] message that had to come to me
[1:17:14] he bore he and me he bore suffering he
[1:17:16] bore
[1:17:17] humiliation he bore rejection amen i
[1:17:20] mean there was nothing comely about him
[1:17:22] there was no intellect that would draw
[1:17:24] men there was nothing in the way he
[1:17:26] presented
[1:17:26] himself that would draw men unto him it
[1:17:29] was the character
[1:17:30] of god and it was the word that drawed
[1:17:31] the seed of god
[1:17:34] when god came he wasn't looking for the
[1:17:36] whole world
[1:17:38] he was looking for his that were in the
[1:17:39] world
[1:17:41] he said i don't pray for the world but i
[1:17:44] pray for mine that are in the world
[1:17:47] and when god sent this hillbilly from
[1:17:49] kentucky
[1:17:50] with poor grammar and no education and
[1:17:52] no finances and no denominational
[1:17:54] backing
[1:17:55] and no prestige and no status
[1:17:58] he sent him because he didn't want to
[1:18:00] draw the whole world
[1:18:02] he only wanted to draw the elect so we
[1:18:05] bring him in humility because only the
[1:18:07] elect
[1:18:08] amen that have the nature of god locked
[1:18:10] in their soul
[1:18:11] will understand humility amen the rest
[1:18:14] of the world doesn't understand it
[1:18:15] because lucifer doesn't understand
[1:18:17] humility
[1:18:18] he looked at michael's kingdom and he
[1:18:20] said i could do better he didn't
[1:18:21] understand that behind
[1:18:23] the humble kingdom of michael of christ
[1:18:25] amen was all the power of god
[1:18:28] god didn't have to show it off god could
[1:18:29] restrain himself because god wanted to
[1:18:31] attract by character
[1:18:33] he didn't want to attract by glory he
[1:18:35] didn't want to attract by beauty
[1:18:36] he wanted to attract the attraction is
[1:18:38] the character
[1:18:40] lucifer had every other attraction but
[1:18:42] he had no character amen
[1:18:44] and now this world is attracted to
[1:18:46] everything that has no character amen
[1:18:48] they're attracted to fashions and
[1:18:50] entertainment and all the things of the
[1:18:52] world but there's no character behind
[1:18:54] it but god sent a man with nothing
[1:18:58] so that he could give us everything
[1:19:03] so we don't look for shiny things we
[1:19:06] look for character
[1:19:10] in the message christ is the mystery of
[1:19:11] god revealed he says notice lucifer in
[1:19:13] the last days is doing as he did it
[1:19:15] first
[1:19:16] what did lucifer do the first thing that
[1:19:18] lucifer done to separate the fellowship
[1:19:20] of god and man
[1:19:21] he wanted to build him a united kingdom
[1:19:23] a greater splendor and seemingly more
[1:19:25] cultured
[1:19:26] a greater kingdom than michael christ
[1:19:28] had
[1:19:29] you got it now if you miss it just hold
[1:19:31] up your hand and i'll say it again
[1:19:34] praise god i would have had my hand up
[1:19:36] the whole time brother brennan
[1:19:38] say it again brother lucifer at the
[1:19:40] beginning
[1:19:41] his purpose in heart was to achieve a
[1:19:43] brighter greater thing in heaven than
[1:19:45] christ had is that right
[1:19:47] by seemingly a more cultured more
[1:19:49] beautiful more splendor
[1:19:50] than the kingdom of christ
[1:19:55] in the fourth seal brother ben says look
[1:19:58] what this is all coming to what is it
[1:20:00] it's going right back the way it did it
[1:20:01] started in heaven is coming to the
[1:20:03] endtime battle
[1:20:05] the first thing in heaven was a battle
[1:20:07] lucifer was kicked out and come to the
[1:20:08] earth
[1:20:09] then he polluted eden then he's been
[1:20:11] polluting ever since
[1:20:13] and now from the battle in heaven it's
[1:20:15] come to the battle on earth and is to be
[1:20:16] finished on earth at the time
[1:20:19] in a battle called armageddon now anyone
[1:20:22] knows that
[1:20:23] the battle started in heaven and so they
[1:20:25] kicked him out
[1:20:26] michael and his angels overthrow them
[1:20:28] just run out and when they did it
[1:20:29] dropped right down into eden
[1:20:31] and here started the battle down here so
[1:20:34] we know that to be true
[1:20:36] that there was a great war that broke
[1:20:38] out in heaven when lucifer rebelled
[1:20:39] against god
[1:20:40] and he thought that he could do better
[1:20:42] he didn't understand the humility of god
[1:20:44] he didn't understand the simplicity that
[1:20:46] he saw he didn't understand the
[1:20:48] character
[1:20:49] all he understood was brightness wisdom
[1:20:51] grandeur
[1:20:52] that's all he could uncomprehend and he
[1:20:54] would look at this and think he could do
[1:20:55] better so he was cast out
[1:20:57] there was war between michael and his
[1:20:59] angels they fought with lucifer and his
[1:21:00] angels and cast him out
[1:21:01] amen but in revelation 12 brother
[1:21:04] branham said that there's going to be
[1:21:05] another casting house
[1:21:09] so the question is how did he get back
[1:21:11] in
[1:21:13] genesis chapter 3 let's look there
[1:21:19] genesis chapter 3.
[1:21:28] verse 1
[1:21:31] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:21:33] beast of the field
[1:21:35] which the lord god had made and he said
[1:21:37] unto the woman yea hath god said you
[1:21:38] shall
[1:21:39] eat of every tree of the garden and the
[1:21:41] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[1:21:43] of the fruit of the trees of the garden
[1:21:45] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:21:47] the midst of the garden god has said you
[1:21:49] shall not eat of it
[1:21:50] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[1:21:52] and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:21:54] you shall not surely die for god doesn't
[1:21:58] know in the day that you eat thereof
[1:21:59] then your eyes shall be open
[1:22:01] and should be as gods knowing good and
[1:22:03] evil
[1:22:04] now he's beginning to entice the woman
[1:22:06] he asks a question and she answers the
[1:22:08] question
[1:22:08] and he begins to contradict the word of
[1:22:10] god and she should have run from that
[1:22:13] but he begins to appeal to her reasoning
[1:22:17] and he begins to explain to her that
[1:22:19] you'll have more
[1:22:22] as if what you have now from god is not
[1:22:24] enough
[1:22:25] but you'll have more you'll be as gods
[1:22:29] knowing good and evil your eyes shall be
[1:22:31] open and you'll be as gods knowing good
[1:22:33] and evil
[1:22:35] now listen god there's things that god
[1:22:38] did not want them to know
[1:22:40] he didn't need for them to know evil
[1:22:43] amen he said you'll be as gods knowing
[1:22:46] good and evil up to this point they only
[1:22:48] knew good
[1:22:50] so the devil's presenting something to
[1:22:52] eve as if god is holding
[1:22:54] out on you as if you're not getting
[1:22:56] everything that's available
[1:22:57] amen but god knows that if you take this
[1:22:59] tree your eyes will be open
[1:23:01] amen but they were under a veil of
[1:23:03] innocency they were blinded under a veil
[1:23:05] of innocency
[1:23:06] it was a good thing but the lucifer
[1:23:08] begins to say there's more knowledge
[1:23:09] there's more understanding you'll know
[1:23:11] good and evil amen and now
[1:23:14] amen god was protecting his children
[1:23:16] from evil
[1:23:17] but eve was going to open the door to
[1:23:19] evil and then your eyes would be open
[1:23:21] and then now they would know good and
[1:23:23] evil god was protecting them from the
[1:23:26] evil
[1:23:27] because we know that heaven was now
[1:23:30] because of the rebellion because of the
[1:23:32] fall
[1:23:33] there was now sin that had broke out in
[1:23:35] heaven god had told lucifer you have
[1:23:37] defiled your sanctuaries
[1:23:40] there was a defilement that took place
[1:23:42] in heaven
[1:23:44] and now when when after the fall when he
[1:23:47] sets
[1:23:48] cherubim with flaming swords and
[1:23:50] eastward and eden
[1:23:51] lest they come and take the tree of life
[1:23:52] and live forever amen
[1:23:54] when he says that he says man has become
[1:23:56] like one of us
[1:23:58] knowing good and evil what do you mean
[1:24:01] become like one of us
[1:24:03] because before rebellion in heaven there
[1:24:05] was only good
[1:24:07] but after the rebellion in heaven evil
[1:24:10] now
[1:24:11] was presented in heaven sin began in
[1:24:13] heaven
[1:24:14] there was a defilement of the
[1:24:15] sanctuaries of lucifer in heaven
[1:24:17] and now god amen comes down to earth to
[1:24:20] create an
[1:24:21] eden and then that eden is called
[1:24:23] pleasure and eastern and eden he plants
[1:24:25] a garden
[1:24:25] and he places his son and now he's
[1:24:27] making something for himself
[1:24:29] that doesn't have good and evil it only
[1:24:31] has good and he puts them under a veil
[1:24:33] of innocency
[1:24:34] and now they're in a condition like
[1:24:35] heaven was before the fall
[1:24:38] but lucifer comes just like he did to
[1:24:41] deceive the angels
[1:24:42] he comes right around and he says you're
[1:24:44] lacking
[1:24:45] there's more there can be something
[1:24:47] greater than the kingdom of michael
[1:24:48] there's something more to be had
[1:24:50] and he begins to deceive eve with a with
[1:24:52] a temptation of more
[1:24:53] more understanding more knowledge and he
[1:24:56] doesn't realize
[1:24:57] what that more knowledge will do what
[1:24:59] that greater understanding will do to
[1:25:00] her
[1:25:01] god has her under a veil of innocency he
[1:25:03] has him in only good with no
[1:25:05] evil now lucifer is trying to bring
[1:25:10] eden into the same condition that heaven
[1:25:12] is in and after she takes and partakes
[1:25:14] of that
[1:25:15] now god says man has now become like one
[1:25:17] of us knowing good and evil
[1:25:19] now what heaven has gone through now the
[1:25:21] earth has gone through the same
[1:25:26] wow so now there's a problem in heaven
[1:25:29] and there's a problem on earth
[1:25:34] and look at what what eve does after
[1:25:36] this dialogue with the serpent
[1:25:39] verse six and when the woman saw that
[1:25:41] the tree was good for food
[1:25:44] and that it was pleasant to the eyes and
[1:25:47] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[1:25:50] she took her the fruit thereof and did
[1:25:51] eat and gave also to her husband with
[1:25:53] her
[1:25:54] and he did eat and the eyes of them both
[1:25:57] were open and they knew that they were
[1:25:58] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[1:26:01] and made themselves aprons when the
[1:26:04] woman looked at the tree
[1:26:07] before this discussion with serp
[1:26:10] the serpent it doesn't say she ever
[1:26:14] considered the tree because the word
[1:26:15] said to avoid it
[1:26:17] but after this discussion when the wise
[1:26:20] one
[1:26:22] because the serpent was more subtle than
[1:26:24] any beast of the field he had more
[1:26:25] understanding
[1:26:27] when the wise one came and said there's
[1:26:29] more than what god has given you
[1:26:31] then she began to desire more and then
[1:26:33] she looked at the tree
[1:26:35] and when she looked at the tree her eyes
[1:26:37] told her that it looked good for food
[1:26:40] that that it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:26:44] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[1:26:47] and she took the fruit thereof
[1:26:48] and did eat when she finally looked at
[1:26:50] the tree and considered the tree
[1:26:52] she couldn't find anything wrong with
[1:26:54] the tree
[1:26:56] and you know what she finds about that
[1:26:58] tree god never said that those things
[1:27:00] weren't true
[1:27:01] god never said that it wasn't good for
[1:27:03] food he never said that it wasn't
[1:27:04] desirable and they never said it wasn't
[1:27:06] pleasant to the eyes
[1:27:08] god never said that he just said leave
[1:27:10] it alone
[1:27:12] so what she saw everything she saw may
[1:27:15] have been true
[1:27:18] all those things were true but
[1:27:21] in her own reasoning now she couldn't
[1:27:24] understand why god would keep me from
[1:27:26] this tree
[1:27:26] everything i see is good so by her own
[1:27:29] reasoning by her own
[1:27:31] brightness by her own wisdom by her own
[1:27:34] intellect
[1:27:34] she decides to take the tree because she
[1:27:36] can't find fault with the tree
[1:27:41] but god said don't touch it god said
[1:27:43] don't eat of it
[1:27:45] and she rebelled against the word of god
[1:27:47] because of her
[1:27:48] own understanding this is why in this
[1:27:52] day god has brought us a word through
[1:27:54] this prophet
[1:27:54] and it doesn't matter whether you
[1:27:56] understand it or not amen you take what
[1:27:58] the prophet said amen
[1:28:00] he's the one that god lifted up and and
[1:28:02] he revealed to him the word he gave him
[1:28:04] the revelation of the entire word
[1:28:06] and he come and he told us things to
[1:28:08] avoid amen things god likes things god
[1:28:10] doesn't like
[1:28:11] and it's not for us to say well i don't
[1:28:12] know what's so bad about that brother
[1:28:14] venom taught us to stay away from some
[1:28:16] of these things
[1:28:17] he taught us the right truth on marriage
[1:28:19] and divorce and interracial marriage and
[1:28:21] all of these other stuff
[1:28:22] and people go to look at that and they
[1:28:23] start reasoning it out and say well i
[1:28:25] don't see what's so wrong with that
[1:28:30] i can't figure it out i can't understand
[1:28:32] it it's not for us to figure out
[1:28:35] it's for us to believe the word of god
[1:28:38] i don't know why he said that i don't
[1:28:39] know why he said that he said it because
[1:28:41] he was the prophet of the age
[1:28:44] and god used him as a mouthpiece and now
[1:28:46] he began to use her own reasoning she
[1:28:48] couldn't find fault with the tree so she
[1:28:50] took it
[1:28:50] and now man has become like one of us
[1:28:53] knowing
[1:28:54] good and evil now eden was now in the
[1:28:57] same condition
[1:28:58] earth was now in the same condition that
[1:29:00] heaven was in
[1:29:01] having had sin break out in it now
[1:29:03] because sin started in heaven
[1:29:06] let's turn to job chapter 6 or job
[1:29:09] chapter
[1:29:10] 1 i'm sorry job chapter 1.
[1:29:17] job chapter 1 verse 6.
[1:29:24] now there was a day when the sons of god
[1:29:27] came to present themselves before the
[1:29:28] lord and satan came also
[1:29:30] among them now we find satan's back in
[1:29:34] heaven
[1:29:36] was satan cast out he was cast out
[1:29:40] war with michael and the angels he was
[1:29:41] cast out the prophet god told his cast
[1:29:43] out and then he went to eden
[1:29:45] but now when we get to the book of job
[1:29:47] and brother banham says job is the
[1:29:48] oldest book in the bible
[1:29:50] now when we get to the book of job we
[1:29:52] find satan back in heaven now
[1:29:54] when the sons of god present themselves
[1:29:56] to god now satan comes also
[1:29:58] now he's in heaven he's presenting
[1:29:59] himself when the sons of god are
[1:30:00] presenting and he's having dialogue
[1:30:03] he says and now the lord said unto satan
[1:30:05] whence cometh thou
[1:30:06] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:30:07] from going to and fro in the earth
[1:30:10] from walking up and down on them the
[1:30:11] lord said unto satan hast thou
[1:30:13] considered my servant job
[1:30:15] there is none like him in all the earth
[1:30:17] and the earth a perfect and an upright
[1:30:19] man one that feareth god
[1:30:21] and a skew of evil then satan answered
[1:30:23] the lord and said does job fear god for
[1:30:25] naught
[1:30:26] look at what he's doing would you say
[1:30:30] he's making an accusation
[1:30:31] against the character of job the job
[1:30:34] fear god for not
[1:30:36] hast thou not made a hedge about him and
[1:30:38] about his house and about all that he
[1:30:40] hath on every side
[1:30:41] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[1:30:43] and his substances increased in the land
[1:30:45] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[1:30:47] all that he hath
[1:30:48] and he will curse thee to thy face
[1:30:52] now let's go back to revelation 12.
[1:30:55] remember my question is what's he doing
[1:30:57] back in heaven
[1:31:00] we know that when he was in heaven the
[1:31:01] first time when he was created
[1:31:03] he had a title his name was lucifer but
[1:31:06] he had a title
[1:31:07] his title was covering cherub he was the
[1:31:10] covering cherub
[1:31:12] but now he's no longer the covering
[1:31:13] cherub he lost that title he lost that
[1:31:15] position was cast
[1:31:16] out but now we find in in revelation 12
[1:31:22] it says let's go back to verse 7 and
[1:31:26] there was war in heaven
[1:31:27] michael and his angels fought against
[1:31:29] the dragon and the dragon fought in his
[1:31:30] angels
[1:31:31] and prevailed not neither was their
[1:31:32] place found anymore in heaven
[1:31:34] and the great dragon was cast out that
[1:31:36] old serpent called the devil and satan
[1:31:38] which deceiveth the whole world
[1:31:40] he was cast out in the earth and his
[1:31:41] angels were cast out with him
[1:31:43] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:31:45] heaven now has come salvation
[1:31:47] and strength and the kingdom of our god
[1:31:50] and the power of
[1:31:50] christ for the accuser
[1:31:54] of our brethren is cast down now
[1:31:58] he has a new title he's no longer the
[1:32:01] covering chair of
[1:32:03] now he's the accuser of the brethren
[1:32:06] when did he get the right to accuse the
[1:32:08] brethren when they fell
[1:32:09] in eden now in the fall in eden now he
[1:32:12] becomes the accuser of the brethren
[1:32:14] and now his position in heaven is no
[1:32:16] longer covering cherub
[1:32:17] but now his position in heaven is
[1:32:21] accuser of the brethren when does he get
[1:32:24] cast down
[1:32:25] let's look at that when the bride goes
[1:32:28] up
[1:32:29] he comes down now he's there as accuser
[1:32:31] of the brethren in job we find in the
[1:32:33] oldest book in the bible the sons of god
[1:32:35] present himself he comes along
[1:32:36] and god says if you consider job and he
[1:32:38] makes an accusation against job
[1:32:40] he says does job serve thee for not it's
[1:32:42] just because you protect him it's not
[1:32:44] because he loves you
[1:32:46] not because he's right what's he doing
[1:32:48] he's the accuser of the brethren all the
[1:32:50] way back
[1:32:50] in job amen when did he start accusing
[1:32:52] the brother when they
[1:32:54] fell from the word of god he became the
[1:32:56] accuser of the brethren
[1:32:58] and gained access into the heavenly
[1:32:59] realm to accuse the brethren
[1:33:01] the seed of god before god but he's
[1:33:04] going to lose that position amen
[1:33:07] he's going to lose it he's going to be
[1:33:09] cast out in the end time
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:15] listen god knew that eden was going to
[1:33:18] be defiled before he ever created it
[1:33:23] brother graham said in the invisible
[1:33:25] union paragraph 208
[1:33:27] when you see the woman a byproduct not
[1:33:29] another female liker made in the order
[1:33:32] knowing that she could be deceived god
[1:33:34] knowed if he didn't know the end from
[1:33:35] the beginning then he wasn't god
[1:33:38] if he isn't if if he isn't
[1:33:41] infinite if he isn't he can he can't be
[1:33:44] infinite without being omniscient
[1:33:46] omnipresent
[1:33:47] knowing all things eternal so he knowed
[1:33:49] all things and he had to make that woman
[1:33:51] the man didn't have a wife the wife and
[1:33:53] the man was the same thing
[1:33:55] he had the feminist masculine spirit in
[1:33:57] himself
[1:33:58] he had to separate take a byproduct
[1:34:00] after the whole creation was made no
[1:34:02] female created by god in the original
[1:34:04] creation can do a thing like that she
[1:34:06] was made thus to do it
[1:34:08] he knowed she would do it he didn't if
[1:34:10] he didn't he wasn't god
[1:34:12] so god is telling brother telling us the
[1:34:14] reason god made the woman the way he
[1:34:16] made the woman
[1:34:17] was so that she could be deceived
[1:34:21] listen but see the attributes that's in
[1:34:25] god
[1:34:26] had to be displayed amen
[1:34:30] he was to be savior and to make
[1:34:32] everything perfect the way he had it
[1:34:33] then there could be nothing lost
[1:34:35] oh don't be children be men and women
[1:34:38] we're at the end road noticed
[1:34:39] brother bam said don't be children be
[1:34:41] men and women grow up in christ amen
[1:34:44] grow up into the knowledge and
[1:34:45] understanding of christ and then god
[1:34:47] knew before eden that there was going to
[1:34:50] be a fall
[1:34:50] how do we know because he had a he had a
[1:34:52] book of life of the lamb slain before
[1:34:54] the foundation of the world
[1:34:56] before the world was formed amen he
[1:34:58] already had names written in a book
[1:35:01] why was their names written in the book
[1:35:03] they were the ones that would be
[1:35:04] redeemed
[1:35:05] why did he know who would be redeemed
[1:35:06] because something would need redemption
[1:35:09] why was the lamb slain before the
[1:35:11] foundation of the world because he knew
[1:35:13] he would need to have a lamb slain
[1:35:15] for redemption before there was a fall
[1:35:17] in eden
[1:35:19] in god's mind before the fall he already
[1:35:21] had a lamb slain
[1:35:23] amen amen so god knew there would be a
[1:35:26] fallen need
[1:35:27] that's why he made the woman the
[1:35:28] byproduct of the man and made her a
[1:35:30] weaker vessel so that she could be
[1:35:32] deceived
[1:35:34] because there was attributes that were
[1:35:36] locked inside of god that had to be
[1:35:38] displayed
[1:35:40] and without the fall we would never come
[1:35:42] to a full understanding of god
[1:35:45] amen
[1:35:49] but god says in isaiah 46 he said
[1:35:52] remember the former things of old
[1:35:54] for i am in god and there is none else i
[1:35:57] am god and there is none like me
[1:35:59] declaring the end from the beginning and
[1:36:00] from ancient times the things that are
[1:36:02] not yet done
[1:36:03] saying my counsel shall stand and i will
[1:36:05] do all my pleasure
[1:36:07] god's plan is not being tripped up by
[1:36:10] the devil
[1:36:13] god's great plan is not he's not
[1:36:15] adjusting his plan by the movements of
[1:36:17] the devil
[1:36:19] god has not gotten tripped in his desire
[1:36:21] and his plan
[1:36:22] from before the foundation world because
[1:36:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:25] he had the name of those that would be
[1:36:26] redeemed he had a lamb that was slain
[1:36:28] he was oh so just the fact that there
[1:36:30] was a fall in eden didn't trip god
[1:36:32] one bit amen he didn't disrupt his plan
[1:36:35] one iota god knew what was going to do
[1:36:37] the satan was playing right into the
[1:36:39] hand of god
[1:36:40] god knew before he recreated the earth
[1:36:43] there was a judgment that took place
[1:36:44] before
[1:36:45] and genesis 1 1 is the original creation
[1:36:47] of heaven and earth
[1:36:48] then you find the earth in a state of
[1:36:50] judgment now god is coming and
[1:36:52] recreating or reforming the earth
[1:36:54] and he's doing this so that he can
[1:36:55] create something for his pleasure
[1:36:58] and he creates it for his pleasure and
[1:37:00] he knows as he's forming it
[1:37:02] as he's positioning the sun as he's
[1:37:04] moving the moisture off of the earth and
[1:37:06] dry lands up here he knows the whole
[1:37:08] time he's doing this there's going to be
[1:37:09] a fall
[1:37:11] he knows corruption is going to set in
[1:37:12] upon this earth he knows it's going to
[1:37:15] happen amen because he's going to do all
[1:37:17] his pleasure
[1:37:17] he's declared from ancient times the
[1:37:19] things that are not yet he already knows
[1:37:21] what's going to happen
[1:37:24] he's bringing up the plants he's
[1:37:25] creating the birds he's creating the
[1:37:27] fishes in the sea
[1:37:28] everything he's doing he already knows
[1:37:31] it's going to fall
[1:37:33] that's why when he comes to eden he puts
[1:37:36] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:37:37] in the garden of eden if you and i were
[1:37:41] doing this we would say hey no
[1:37:42] no no wait a minute what happens if they
[1:37:45] eat from that tree
[1:37:46] or they eat from that tree they'll die
[1:37:49] well don't put it there
[1:37:53] you and i we wouldn't put it there but
[1:37:56] that's because we don't understand the
[1:37:57] mind of god
[1:37:58] god put it there he wanted it there it
[1:38:00] was going to accomplish his purpose
[1:38:01] he knew they would eat of it he knew
[1:38:03] there would be a fall he knew corruption
[1:38:05] and perversion was said and he knew
[1:38:07] death would fall upon man
[1:38:08] he knew satan would set up the
[1:38:10] squatter's rights he knew there would be
[1:38:12] a satan's eating after 6 000 years
[1:38:15] he knew it but he did it
[1:38:19] and doing it must fit into his
[1:38:22] plan
[1:38:25] see it's not that satan makes a move
[1:38:29] it's not like satan makes a move
[1:38:32] and god goes oh that was a good one
[1:38:37] i didn't see that coming then god makes
[1:38:40] another move but he's smarter so he can
[1:38:42] always outsmart him
[1:38:43] that's not how this works before the
[1:38:45] devil ever makes a move
[1:38:47] god said i knew he was going to do that
[1:38:51] do you understand this is not time to be
[1:38:54] children
[1:38:56] the eagle age we've been lifted out of
[1:38:58] the carnal into the spiritual
[1:39:00] we've been living off the natural
[1:39:01] understanding into a spiritual
[1:39:03] understanding
[1:39:04] to know our god to know our men to know
[1:39:06] our husband
[1:39:10] and the adoption
[1:39:13] he says so beautiful displayed in the
[1:39:16] prodigal son i was lost this
[1:39:18] is my son he was lost and now he's found
[1:39:20] he was dead and he's alive again bring
[1:39:22] forth the fatted calf the best robe a
[1:39:24] ring and put it on his finger
[1:39:26] no wonder when the morning stars sang
[1:39:28] together and the sons of god shouted for
[1:39:29] joy
[1:39:30] when they seen the plan of salvation
[1:39:34] you catch that all the way in job he
[1:39:36] says where were you when the sons of god
[1:39:38] shouted for joy and the morning stars
[1:39:40] sang together where were you and brother
[1:39:42] ben i'm saying now
[1:39:43] listen no wonder the morning stars sing
[1:39:46] together the sons of god shout out for
[1:39:47] joy
[1:39:48] when they seen the plan of salvation
[1:39:52] god putting your name on the book before
[1:39:54] the foundation of the world
[1:39:56] the sons of god in the mind of god they
[1:39:58] saw the plan of salvation before there
[1:40:01] was a fall
[1:40:03] that's why when when this revelation
[1:40:06] comes there's something in us says amen
[1:40:08] it's because god shared with you the
[1:40:10] plan before when you were in the mind of
[1:40:12] god he shared with you the plan
[1:40:14] and you got so excited you shouted and
[1:40:16] copped your head and danced a little bit
[1:40:18] and said
[1:40:18] that's a good plan father that'll work
[1:40:20] amen
[1:40:21] and now when all this corruption sets in
[1:40:23] amen now we look back and understand god
[1:40:26] knew
[1:40:26] god had a lamb slain before the
[1:40:28] foundation of the world satan's not
[1:40:29] tripping up god
[1:40:30] he's moving right in but this whole
[1:40:33] creation is a trap
[1:40:36] and satan is falling into the trap and
[1:40:39] at some point the trap door is going to
[1:40:41] shut amen
[1:40:42] and we're not going to deal with our
[1:40:43] enemy anymore
[1:40:47] i see this satan's the trap and you're
[1:40:50] the bait
[1:40:54] and he comes after you
[1:40:57] because he come after eve there was a
[1:41:01] trap set
[1:41:02] god needed the fall to display his
[1:41:04] attributes
[1:41:06] in his mind he had a lamb slain and
[1:41:09] there's no point for a lamb slain unless
[1:41:10] there's a fall here in eden
[1:41:12] so he created a weaker vessel and the
[1:41:15] devil began to exploit the weakness that
[1:41:17] was in the woman
[1:41:18] she could be enticed amen and she she
[1:41:21] could be seduced and he began to explore
[1:41:23] that weakness
[1:41:23] and he thought ah i found a place here
[1:41:26] where i can enter in
[1:41:28] i found a weak spot god must have missed
[1:41:31] this
[1:41:33] and there's a trap set and eve is the
[1:41:35] bait
[1:41:36] and the devil's coming around and he's
[1:41:38] sniffing the bait he doesn't know
[1:41:40] there's a big old trap right there
[1:41:43] and he's going to get he's going to get
[1:41:44] trapped he's gonna be destroyed
[1:41:47] because he took the bait
[1:41:50] in the fourth seal the man said god had
[1:41:53] his children all fortified up
[1:41:55] by his word and eve stuck her neck out
[1:41:57] and said i believe you're right
[1:41:59] and there it went it's ever since and
[1:42:01] god come down
[1:42:02] now he's got to he come down to redeem
[1:42:05] those
[1:42:06] that would come down
[1:42:09] god already knew we would come down he
[1:42:12] already showed us the plan of redemption
[1:42:14] and he come down to redeem those that
[1:42:17] would come down
[1:42:19] god is like a big contractor he's laying
[1:42:21] out all his material on earth
[1:42:22] and then he builds his building now
[1:42:24] remember before there was grain
[1:42:26] of seed on earth before there was a sun
[1:42:28] that ever struck the earth
[1:42:29] your body was laying on the earth
[1:42:31] because you are the dust of the earth
[1:42:32] you are god's the contractor listen
[1:42:35] before there was a fall in eden my body
[1:42:38] was already laying here
[1:42:39] god's a great contractor he knew the
[1:42:41] bride that he was going to build and he
[1:42:42] already put the material for my body
[1:42:44] here because he knew i would be here
[1:42:46] he knew i would be here in satan's eden
[1:42:48] he knew the perversion that would be all
[1:42:50] around me
[1:42:51] he knew what was going to take place and
[1:42:53] he knew where he placed me
[1:42:54] and he knew where he placed you god has
[1:42:57] not made a mistake
[1:42:58] i mean don't don't dare say i wish i
[1:43:00] lived in the prophet's day
[1:43:01] god ordained you to live in this day oh
[1:43:04] i wish i lived back then and i wish i
[1:43:06] lived back when i could take a prairie
[1:43:08] scooter blah blah blah blah blah
[1:43:10] no you don't because before the
[1:43:11] foundation of the world when you were in
[1:43:13] the mind of god
[1:43:14] he showed you the plan of salvation and
[1:43:16] you said that's a good plan but
[1:43:17] then begin to clap your hands you
[1:43:19] already knew where your place would be
[1:43:21] you already knew what time you would be
[1:43:22] on this earth that's why when the
[1:43:24] message comes to you it's got a familiar
[1:43:26] sound to it
[1:43:27] because there's a seed of god an
[1:43:28] attribute of god that come from the mind
[1:43:30] of god
[1:43:31] way down on the inside that was there
[1:43:33] amen when the plan was formulated
[1:43:37] and god didn't want you any other time
[1:43:39] he wants you at this time
[1:43:41] you see but it's so wicked i can barely
[1:43:43] live he ordained you to live
[1:43:45] he ordained you to overcome he ordained
[1:43:48] you this is a trap amen it's a bride
[1:43:50] trap and you're the bait
[1:43:56] the devil comes around you and says it
[1:43:58] looks so weak
[1:44:00] not very smart doesn't have much money
[1:44:04] if i just make the transmission go out
[1:44:06] in this truck he's going to be
[1:44:07] devastated
[1:44:12] he'll curse god to his face he'll be
[1:44:15] discouraged he won't go to church on
[1:44:17] sunday
[1:44:18] he'll be so upset he'll doubt whether
[1:44:19] he's the son of god or not
[1:44:24] it's debate
[1:44:27] he's going to come and try to wreck your
[1:44:29] day and wreck your life and wreck your
[1:44:31] home
[1:44:32] he doesn't realize there's a power there
[1:44:36] there's a 10 000 volt wire he's going to
[1:44:38] get at home that's going to singe his
[1:44:40] feathers when he gets a hold of it
[1:44:42] because it's not just a little earthly
[1:44:44] vessel you're looking at but there's a
[1:44:45] god down on the inside
[1:44:47] by a new birth the attributes of god has
[1:44:49] sprung the life and the spirit of god is
[1:44:50] living there
[1:44:51] amen and there's faith to take god at
[1:44:53] his word and defeat everything the enemy
[1:44:55] will throw our way
[1:45:00] jesus tells us the son of man has come
[1:45:02] to seek and to save that which was lost
[1:45:05] if it was lost it was first found
[1:45:08] it can't be found unless it was lost it
[1:45:10] can't be lost unless it was with god
[1:45:13] this is my pen
[1:45:16] if i lose this pen and find this pen i
[1:45:19] didn't find something new
[1:45:21] i didn't gain anything i just got back
[1:45:24] what was already with me
[1:45:27] if i lose this pin and you bring me this
[1:45:30] pin
[1:45:31] that's not salvation that's not
[1:45:33] redemption that's not finding my pen
[1:45:36] that's replacing my pen and god's not
[1:45:39] replacing
[1:45:40] anything god seeking to save that which
[1:45:43] was lost
[1:45:45] god knew it would be lost he knew from
[1:45:47] this condition and he came down with a
[1:45:48] message in this day
[1:45:49] to pull back his original creation his
[1:45:52] original attribute and bring it right
[1:45:53] back to himself
[1:45:58] let's go to colossians chapter one
[1:46:06] colossians chapter one
[1:46:10] now pay attention closely for a few
[1:46:12] minutes as we begin to wind down and
[1:46:15] really get to the heart of what i'm
[1:46:16] really wanting to share
[1:46:19] colossians 1 15.
[1:46:23] brother branham reads this scripture
[1:46:25] when he's coming to christ as the
[1:46:26] mystery god revealed
[1:46:28] he's reading down through here and he
[1:46:29] injects a comment and i'm going to share
[1:46:31] that with you when we get to that
[1:46:32] scripture
[1:46:33] but i'd like to begin reading at verse
[1:46:35] 15.
[1:46:38] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:46:40] the firstborn of every creature
[1:46:43] for by him were all things created that
[1:46:45] are in heaven that are in earth visible
[1:46:47] and invisible whether they be thrones
[1:46:49] or dominions or principalities or powers
[1:46:51] all things were created by him
[1:46:53] and for him and he is before all things
[1:46:56] and by him all things consist
[1:46:58] and he is the head of the body the
[1:47:00] church which is the beginning
[1:47:02] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:47:04] things he might have the preeminence
[1:47:07] for it please the father that in him
[1:47:08] should all fullness dwell
[1:47:10] and having made peace through the blood
[1:47:12] of his cross by him
[1:47:13] to reconcile all things and to himself
[1:47:16] by him i say whether there be things in
[1:47:19] earth
[1:47:20] or things in heaven and brother benham
[1:47:22] stops reading here
[1:47:24] and he injects this statement he says
[1:47:26] watch where that reconciliation
[1:47:28] went he's talking about christ coming in
[1:47:32] a bodily form and
[1:47:33] dying amen to reconcile us back to god
[1:47:36] but he says now listen i want to read it
[1:47:39] again in verse 20
[1:47:40] and having made peace through the blood
[1:47:42] of his cross by him
[1:47:44] to reconcile all things all things
[1:47:47] all things unto himself by him i say
[1:47:50] whether they be things in earth or
[1:47:54] things in heaven
[1:47:58] now listen christ come and took a body
[1:48:02] of flesh
[1:48:02] for redemption because of the fall in
[1:48:04] the garden of eden
[1:48:07] but i'll say further back christ come
[1:48:10] and took a body of flesh to die on
[1:48:12] calvary
[1:48:13] not just for redemption of what happened
[1:48:15] in eden but for reconciliation what
[1:48:17] happened in heaven
[1:48:19] because he reconciled in the body of his
[1:48:21] flesh all
[1:48:22] things by him all things whether they be
[1:48:26] things in
[1:48:26] earth or things in heaven
[1:48:29] this is why before god when god was
[1:48:32] creating eden he knew it would fall
[1:48:34] but god is going to fix a big problem
[1:48:36] and that problem started in heaven when
[1:48:38] lucifer fell
[1:48:39] and he's using this creation and he's
[1:48:41] using this plan and everything he's
[1:48:43] doing now is to fix that problem there
[1:48:46] because remember when lucifer fell he
[1:48:47] was cast out of heaven he come to earth
[1:48:49] and brought corruption in eden
[1:48:51] but listen he was not destroyed
[1:48:54] he was not destroyed and you realize why
[1:48:57] didn't god destroy him well we know
[1:48:58] because the prophet told us he needed a
[1:49:00] good adversary so he could pull out all
[1:49:02] of the attributes of god
[1:49:03] there needed to be a negative there
[1:49:04] needed to be something to create
[1:49:06] corruption and
[1:49:07] and and and deception and all these
[1:49:09] things that would pull out the nature of
[1:49:10] god
[1:49:11] but god also operates by his laws amen
[1:49:14] and there's laws in heaven just like
[1:49:15] there's laws on earth
[1:49:16] and when god operates by his laws when
[1:49:18] lucifer fell something
[1:49:20] prevented god from destroying him
[1:49:24] because god always operates by his laws
[1:49:27] something prevented god from destroying
[1:49:29] him but we know
[1:49:31] that ultimately lucifer will be
[1:49:32] destroyed so god now is creating a trap
[1:49:35] in eden
[1:49:36] he's creating a new creation upon the
[1:49:38] earth after destruction has come
[1:49:40] and at the end of this cycle of
[1:49:42] redemption at the end of this
[1:49:44] we know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[1:49:46] that lucifer is thrown into the lake of
[1:49:47] fire and he's completely destroyed
[1:49:50] because of the judgment of god as judge
[1:49:52] so god through this creation through
[1:49:54] this life cycle through this redemption
[1:49:56] he is not just reconciling things on
[1:49:58] earth but he's reconciling heaven
[1:50:00] and earth
[1:50:04] this is so much bigger than we think
[1:50:06] friends this is so much beyond our
[1:50:08] carnal understanding
[1:50:09] this is so big it's so beyond our 70 or
[1:50:11] 80 years upon this planet
[1:50:13] we can't think like children anymore
[1:50:15] we've got to understand god has sent us
[1:50:17] down as an attribute of god
[1:50:18] as his son upon this earth because he's
[1:50:20] reconciling
[1:50:22] everything that has went wrong is being
[1:50:23] reconciled everything that's been made
[1:50:25] wrong is now being made right
[1:50:27] and you and i are here as living
[1:50:29] attributes of god
[1:50:31] part of the reconciliation redemption
[1:50:33] process amen so that when we unite back
[1:50:35] with heaven
[1:50:36] it's not going to be a heaven where
[1:50:37] lucifer can be accuser of the brethren
[1:50:39] it's not going to be where lucifer can
[1:50:40] bring any more deception but things are
[1:50:42] being purged
[1:50:43] purified cleansed transitioned until he
[1:50:46] can be
[1:50:51] it's annihilated just about going to
[1:50:53] work on monday
[1:50:55] it's not just about having a retirement
[1:50:57] account it's not just about the next car
[1:50:59] i can buy
[1:51:00] or a change of clothes i can get it's
[1:51:02] not about my next vacation
[1:51:03] those things are fine they're not evil
[1:51:05] in and of themselves but when they
[1:51:06] become distractions against the purpose
[1:51:08] god put you on this earth for
[1:51:10] amen it begins to take away it because
[1:51:12] satan begins to take away from the
[1:51:14] original purpose
[1:51:15] the plan of god don't forget that you
[1:51:18] saw the plan of salvation and you
[1:51:20] shouted and rejoiced that
[1:51:21] you say amen today because you said amen
[1:51:24] that day
[1:51:27] so don't get distracted from your
[1:51:29] purpose on this planet
[1:51:30] don't get distracted by those natural
[1:51:32] things keep in mind when you buy a car
[1:51:35] you buy a car as a son of god because
[1:51:36] i'm here for a purpose of god
[1:51:38] and i need that car to do whatever god
[1:51:40] wants me to do
[1:51:43] even if you take a rest like brother ben
[1:51:45] took a rest and took a vacation
[1:51:46] i'm doing it for strength because i'm
[1:51:48] here for a purpose i'm not just here
[1:51:50] seeking pleasure
[1:51:51] i'm not just here doing all that i can
[1:51:53] to satisfy myself
[1:51:54] i'm here as an agent of god almighty to
[1:51:56] reverse the curse that's set in
[1:51:58] in heaven
[1:52:02] there's a trap set and after this trap
[1:52:05] is sprung
[1:52:06] at the end of the millennium lucifer is
[1:52:10] annihilated
[1:52:13] god's problem is fixed forever
[1:52:20] watch where that reconciliation went he
[1:52:23] says
[1:52:24] it went to heaven too let's turn to
[1:52:26] hebrews 9. i just want to reinforce this
[1:52:29] statement
[1:52:30] i don't want you to get the idea that
[1:52:31] brother chad's just making things up
[1:52:34] brother branham taught us these things
[1:52:35] friends
[1:52:39] we've come to the end time to the final
[1:52:42] dispensation to the final battles to the
[1:52:45] final round
[1:52:47] and god has given us his mind so that we
[1:52:49] won't be tripped up in this final hour
[1:52:53] let's look at hebrews 9 and 19
[1:52:56] for when moses had spoken every precept
[1:52:59] to
[1:52:59] all the people according to the law he
[1:53:02] took the blood of calves and of goats
[1:53:04] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop
[1:53:06] and sprinkled both the book
[1:53:07] and all the people saying this is the
[1:53:09] blood of the testament which god hath
[1:53:11] enjoined
[1:53:12] unto you moreover he sprinkled with
[1:53:14] blood both the tabernacle and all the
[1:53:16] vessels of the ministry
[1:53:18] and almost all things are by the law
[1:53:20] purged with blood and without
[1:53:21] shedding of blood is no remission of
[1:53:23] sins
[1:53:25] now pay close attention it was therefore
[1:53:28] necessary that the patterns of things in
[1:53:30] heaven what is the patterns of things in
[1:53:32] heaven
[1:53:33] moses was told to make the tabernacle
[1:53:35] after the pattern of what he saw in
[1:53:37] heaven
[1:53:38] so moses made on earth the pattern of
[1:53:41] the heavenly things
[1:53:43] and that pattern had to be purged
[1:53:46] purified with these now let's read this
[1:53:49] it was therefore necessary what
[1:53:51] were they purged with blood it was
[1:53:54] therefore necessary that the patterns of
[1:53:56] things in heaven
[1:53:57] should be purified with these but the
[1:53:59] heavenly things themselves
[1:54:01] with better sacrifices than these
[1:54:05] you mean the heavenly things needed
[1:54:08] purified
[1:54:12] if the heavenly things needed purified
[1:54:15] it means the heavenly things had been
[1:54:16] defiled
[1:54:18] how had the heavenly sanctuary been
[1:54:20] defiled when the covering
[1:54:22] cherub rebelled against the word of god
[1:54:24] and brought defilement into his
[1:54:25] sanctuaries
[1:54:26] now there's a defilement in heaven and
[1:54:28] jesus's very shedding of blood
[1:54:31] and giving of life he would carry that
[1:54:33] life now into the heavenly realm
[1:54:35] to purify the things that are in heaven
[1:54:39] so that means the very earth and the
[1:54:42] creation of the earth and the plan of
[1:54:43] redemption
[1:54:44] is not just for earth it's for heaven
[1:54:47] too
[1:54:47] even christ dying at calvary wasn't just
[1:54:50] for natural things
[1:54:51] not just for earth it was for the
[1:54:52] heavenly things too
[1:54:56] so this reconciliation and all things in
[1:54:59] christ jesus is reconciling heaven
[1:55:01] and earth the blood
[1:55:04] the life the blood of the high priest
[1:55:06] had to go beyond the veil
[1:55:08] into the heavenly sanctuary to purify
[1:55:13] the heavenly things see we get so
[1:55:17] small-minded and worried about our
[1:55:19] little trouble
[1:55:21] we get so small-minded and tormented by
[1:55:24] this little thing we're dealing with
[1:55:25] and we miss this is all part of this
[1:55:28] plan
[1:55:29] it's all part of the reconciliation of
[1:55:31] all things
[1:55:32] it's all part of reversing the curse
[1:55:34] it's all part of defeating lucifer it's
[1:55:36] all part of god's great plan
[1:55:38] to purify to cleanse to destroy his
[1:55:44] enemy
[1:55:46] now let's look at second corinthians
[1:55:50] chapter five
[1:55:58] ii corinthians chapter 5.
[1:56:08] now before we go there i just want to i
[1:56:11] just feel like i want to inject this
[1:56:13] thought
[1:56:16] we know that something's wrong in the
[1:56:18] heavenly realm
[1:56:21] because there's an accuser of the
[1:56:22] brethren there something's wrong in the
[1:56:24] heavenly realm
[1:56:26] we know there's something wrong in the
[1:56:27] heavenly realm because remember when
[1:56:29] gabriel was dispatched to daniel because
[1:56:31] daniel began to pray
[1:56:33] daniel began to pray and he wanted
[1:56:34] understanding of the revelation that was
[1:56:37] in jeremiah 70 weeks and gabriel was
[1:56:39] dispatched but gabriel comes to him in
[1:56:41] the book of daniel
[1:56:42] and says on the first day that i began
[1:56:44] to pray i was sent with a message to you
[1:56:47] but the prince of the nation of persia
[1:56:50] withstood me
[1:56:52] and you say well an angel of god can do
[1:56:54] anything he wants
[1:56:57] don't forget heaven's a reflection of
[1:56:59] this dimension
[1:57:00] and this dimension there's laws and
[1:57:02] there's jurisdictions and there's
[1:57:03] hierarchies
[1:57:04] and that dimension there's the same
[1:57:05] thing and brother bam talks about this
[1:57:08] in demonology
[1:57:09] he's very clear about there's a whole
[1:57:11] spiritual realm and a whole demonic
[1:57:13] realm
[1:57:13] and now in the in the heavenly realm
[1:57:16] daniel's praying
[1:57:17] and listen the the the world the
[1:57:20] the heavenly realm is so dependent on
[1:57:22] the children of god on earth putting it
[1:57:25] in action
[1:57:27] daniel's prayer put gabriel in action
[1:57:30] until daniel prayed nothing was moving
[1:57:33] amen we think heaven's heaven and earth
[1:57:35] earth
[1:57:35] you don't realize amen that what you're
[1:57:37] doing here is having an effect over
[1:57:39] there amen
[1:57:40] brother bam said everything you see here
[1:57:42] is a reflection of something over there
[1:57:44] and what you're doing here is putting
[1:57:45] something in motion something in action
[1:57:47] daniel began to pray and gabriel began
[1:57:49] to move when daniel began to pray
[1:57:52] he said the very day that you prayed i
[1:57:54] was sent amen
[1:57:56] but this prince of persia of the nation
[1:57:59] of persia which stood in me
[1:58:00] and i had to go back and get michael
[1:58:03] a higher ranking angel
[1:58:07] and now michael helped me break through
[1:58:10] to you
[1:58:12] do you realize something's wrong in
[1:58:14] heaven if there's an angel over persia
[1:58:16] that could withstand gabriel
[1:58:18] something needs to be eliminated in
[1:58:19] heaven amen something needs to be purged
[1:58:22] out of that heavenly realm
[1:58:23] so heaven and earth can move free under
[1:58:25] the commandment of god again
[1:58:29] see the apostle paul
[1:58:32] tells us that we don't war with flesh
[1:58:34] and blood
[1:58:36] but against principalities and powers
[1:58:38] and kingdoms
[1:58:40] in high places that word high means
[1:58:42] heavenly
[1:58:44] this earth we're not at war with
[1:58:46] anything on this earth
[1:58:48] but we are at war with principalities
[1:58:51] powers and kingdoms in the heavenly
[1:58:54] realms
[1:58:55] that's what we're at war with that's why
[1:58:57] when he says the weapons our warfare are
[1:58:58] not carnal
[1:58:59] amen but spiritual into bringing down
[1:59:02] strongholds
[1:59:02] look at the strongholds casting down
[1:59:05] imagination where's the greatest battle
[1:59:06] ever thought
[1:59:07] and every thought that exalted itself
[1:59:09] against the knowledge of god
[1:59:11] where is the warfare taking place in you
[1:59:13] what are the weapons given to us not
[1:59:15] carnal
[1:59:16] because it's not a carnal battle it's a
[1:59:18] spiritual battle and our weapons are
[1:59:20] spiritual
[1:59:20] to fix the problem the war in your mind
[1:59:23] the cast
[1:59:24] down and to bring into captivity every
[1:59:26] thought that exalted itself against the
[1:59:28] knowledge of christ
[1:59:31] our warfare is with principalities and
[1:59:34] powers
[1:59:35] not in high places not in the government
[1:59:37] not in washington not in
[1:59:38] the kremlin that's not the heavenly
[1:59:41] places
[1:59:42] and we're at war against those powers in
[1:59:45] heavenly places
[1:59:46] and when a son of god on earth begins to
[1:59:48] pray and begins to pray the word and
[1:59:51] begins to seek revelation
[1:59:52] it puts heaven in motion and warfare
[1:59:54] breaks out
[1:59:55] i think if we could peek into the other
[1:59:57] side we'd be shocked right now
[1:59:58] at the warfare that's breaking out at
[2:00:00] this message right now and all the the
[2:00:02] realms of evil that is that are trying
[2:00:04] to withstand the revelation of good
[2:00:06] and the angels of the lord that are
[2:00:07] coming in to back up the word
[2:00:09] amen because they're ministering spirits
[2:00:11] sent to minister to the children of god
[2:00:16] brother branham come to break us out of
[2:00:18] carnal thinking
[2:00:20] and so we know that that's the warfare
[2:00:22] and we know that when we here on earth
[2:00:24] began to take spiritual insight
[2:00:27] it begins to move things in the
[2:00:29] spiritual realm
[2:00:31] let's look at second corinthians chapter
[2:00:32] five now
[2:00:34] verse 16.
[2:00:41] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[2:00:43] after the flesh yea though we have known
[2:00:45] christ after the flesh
[2:00:46] yet not henceforth knoweth we him no
[2:00:48] more therefore if any man be in christ
[2:00:51] he is a new creature old things are
[2:00:52] passed away behold all
[2:00:54] things are become new and all things are
[2:00:56] of god who has reconciled us to himself
[2:00:58] by jesus christ and hath given to us
[2:01:02] the ministry of reconciliation
[2:01:07] so god hath reconciled
[2:01:10] us paul saying god hath reconciled us to
[2:01:13] himself by jesus christ
[2:01:15] because jesus christ in his flesh he
[2:01:17] reconciled all things in heaven and
[2:01:19] earth
[2:01:19] now through jesus christ god had
[2:01:21] reconciled paul back to himself
[2:01:22] but then paul says and hath given us the
[2:01:25] ministry of reconciliation
[2:01:27] so now that reconciliation between
[2:01:29] heaven and earth that ministry is now
[2:01:31] given to paul
[2:01:32] and paul now has the ministry of
[2:01:34] reconciliation
[2:01:38] to wit look at this to wit that god was
[2:01:41] in
[2:01:41] christ reconciling the world unto
[2:01:44] himself
[2:01:46] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[2:01:47] and hath committed unto
[2:01:49] us the word of reconciliation
[2:01:53] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[2:01:57] what are you here to do you're here to
[2:01:59] finish the work of reconciliation
[2:02:01] what's being reconciled all things both
[2:02:03] heaven and in earth
[2:02:05] and committed unto you is the word of
[2:02:07] reconciliation
[2:02:09] and now we are ambassadors
[2:02:11] representatives representing christ
[2:02:13] we are ambassadors for christ as though
[2:02:16] god did beseech you by us as though god
[2:02:19] is calling to you through our lips
[2:02:22] as though god did beseech you by us we
[2:02:24] pray you in christ's dead
[2:02:26] we call to you in the place of christ
[2:02:28] instead of christ we're here instead of
[2:02:30] jesus christ because he's here in
[2:02:32] us we pray you in christ's dead
[2:02:35] be ye reconciled to god
[2:02:40] be ye reconciled to god
[2:02:44] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[2:02:46] who knew no sin
[2:02:48] that we might be made the righteousness
[2:02:50] of god in him
[2:02:52] where is that ministry of reconciliation
[2:02:54] now it's in the bride
[2:02:57] what is it we've been called to it's a
[2:02:58] higher work than just
[2:03:00] try to be nice at work and try to be
[2:03:01] good to your neighbor and try not to
[2:03:03] steal time from work and be honest
[2:03:05] it's more than that friend we've been
[2:03:07] given the word of reconciliation and
[2:03:08] that reconciliation is reconciling
[2:03:11] all things that were reconciled in the
[2:03:12] flesh of jesus christ
[2:03:16] it's for the destruction and elimination
[2:03:18] of lucifer not so we keep playing games
[2:03:20] with him anymore
[2:03:21] but we're here on this earth to destroy
[2:03:23] him amen
[2:03:25] that's what brother branham said
[2:03:29] i want to look at a few quotes here
[2:03:31] let's look at
[2:03:32] my new ministry from 1959
[2:03:36] my new ministry i'm starting paragraph
[2:03:38] 95.
[2:03:40] now you say well if he knows it then why
[2:03:42] are you preaching if god knows all
[2:03:44] things then why are you preaching
[2:03:45] if he knows who will be saved and who
[2:03:46] won't why are you preaching
[2:03:48] he said that's part of god's program
[2:03:50] preaching is his program
[2:03:53] when he looked upon the apostles he
[2:03:54] looked upon the harvest he said the
[2:03:56] harvest is ripe and the laborers refuse
[2:03:58] pray the lord of the harvest that he
[2:03:59] will send laborers into his harvest
[2:04:01] how many remembers that well why would
[2:04:02] they have to pray to the lord of the
[2:04:04] harvest to send laborers into the
[2:04:05] harvest
[2:04:06] if the lord of the harvest was standing
[2:04:07] there knowing it would be done
[2:04:09] why god has so arranged it now listen to
[2:04:12] this
[2:04:13] god has so arranged it that his program
[2:04:15] cannot move without
[2:04:17] you and die
[2:04:20] and as long as we're not doing what god
[2:04:23] leads us to do we are
[2:04:24] paralyzing his program
[2:04:29] but when the church moves by the
[2:04:30] anointing of the holy ghost then we are
[2:04:32] in god's will
[2:04:33] doing this program remember when daniel
[2:04:36] began to pray for the revelation of 70
[2:04:38] weeks
[2:04:38] it was at the time that god was going to
[2:04:41] bring them back
[2:04:42] and and it was at time that god was
[2:04:44] going to return them to babylon
[2:04:46] but god could not initiate gabriel he
[2:04:48] could not initiate the movement
[2:04:50] he could not bring the transition until
[2:04:52] daniel began to pray
[2:04:54] when daniel began to pray now god says
[2:04:56] can go gabriel now it's time
[2:04:58] god had so worked his program that it
[2:05:00] couldn't move without daniel
[2:05:02] and when daniel started praying now god
[2:05:04] was saying now it's time
[2:05:05] it's now time to get to start gabriel
[2:05:07] you go gabriel couldn't go and can
[2:05:08] michael i need your help
[2:05:09] it's time amen and now after that
[2:05:12] meeting
[2:05:13] after the the king of the prince of
[2:05:15] persia began to withstand gabriel
[2:05:17] wouldn't let him in
[2:05:18] michael come and open the door he got in
[2:05:20] now he tells him now i got to go
[2:05:23] and i'm going to go back and fight that
[2:05:25] king of persia because the king of
[2:05:27] greece is going to come in the very
[2:05:29] prayer of daniel started a sequence of
[2:05:32] events
[2:05:32] that will collapse the medes and
[2:05:34] persians and bring alexander the great
[2:05:35] in
[2:05:36] to collapse that kingdom to keep the
[2:05:37] plan of god moving with the image from
[2:05:39] gold
[2:05:40] down to the chest of silver down into
[2:05:42] the the belly and thighs of brass
[2:05:45] it was now a transition time and god had
[2:05:47] to have somebody on the earth with a
[2:05:49] spiritual sensitivity
[2:05:50] to begin calling out and asking god and
[2:05:52] then god would put the wheels in motion
[2:05:54] it was god's redemption plan but god has
[2:05:56] linked heaven and earth through his
[2:05:58] attributes
[2:05:59] and god can't move without you and i and
[2:06:02] as long as we're not moving under the
[2:06:03] leadership of the holy ghost
[2:06:04] we are paralyzing god's program
[2:06:09] amen that's why we've got to set
[2:06:12] everything aside
[2:06:13] and this word has to become everything
[2:06:14] to us this message is in another doctor
[2:06:16] there's not another movement it's not
[2:06:18] another church
[2:06:19] this message is the revelation of what
[2:06:20] god is doing in this hour
[2:06:22] it is the culmination of the gentile
[2:06:24] dispensation
[2:06:25] it is the plan of god and he's got to
[2:06:27] have people on the earth that are
[2:06:29] calling out
[2:06:29] and crying out for every promise to be
[2:06:31] fulfilled amen so that god can dispatch
[2:06:34] the angels so that the things in heaven
[2:06:36] can begin to move
[2:06:37] if you only knew the warfare that was
[2:06:39] going on right now
[2:06:40] amen we would be more diligent about
[2:06:42] prayer we'd be more sincere about this
[2:06:44] word
[2:06:44] we would stop playing around with the
[2:06:46] world and quit fooling around with all
[2:06:48] this nonsense
[2:06:49] it would focus us in it would hone us
[2:06:52] down
[2:06:52] it would tune us up because everything's
[2:06:55] moving
[2:06:55] as the children of god are moving in the
[2:06:57] plan of redemption
[2:07:06] let's look at luke chapter 10.
[2:07:13] luke chapter 10
[2:07:18] in luke chapter 10 god sends out the
[2:07:20] disciples two by two he sends the
[2:07:22] seventy out
[2:07:23] and he tells them what to do and how to
[2:07:25] go preach the kingdom of god is at hand
[2:07:27] and they go out preaching
[2:07:29] and they return and when they return
[2:07:32] they say this and
[2:07:33] in verse 17 and the 70 returned again
[2:07:37] with joy saying lord
[2:07:38] even the devils are subject unto us
[2:07:40] through thy name
[2:07:42] and he said unto them i beheld satan as
[2:07:45] lightning
[2:07:46] fall from heaven what did god say
[2:07:49] i'm seeing the fall of lucifer
[2:07:52] when what when his attributes begin to
[2:07:55] take their place
[2:07:56] when his attributes begin to take the
[2:07:58] commandment of the lord and move
[2:08:00] in commandment of the lord and express
[2:08:01] the power and authority that god has
[2:08:03] given them under the word of god
[2:08:05] when they begin to challenge the devil's
[2:08:07] kingdom when they begin to cast out
[2:08:09] devils when they begin to preach the
[2:08:10] word when they go from city city
[2:08:12] preaching it
[2:08:12] they come back and they testify to jesus
[2:08:14] this is what happened
[2:08:15] and he says i beheld he's looking at a
[2:08:18] prophecy amen
[2:08:19] he's looking at the end time when the
[2:08:21] lucifer is cast out of heaven forever
[2:08:23] he says i beheld satan as lightning as a
[2:08:26] shining light
[2:08:27] falling that false light is falling him
[2:08:29] and that false light is coming down
[2:08:31] what made him say that when his
[2:08:33] attributes when the sons of god
[2:08:35] begin to take their position by the word
[2:08:38] begin to take their authority and begin
[2:08:40] to stand on it
[2:08:43] jesus sent him out to be his ambassadors
[2:08:47] to be a voice in his dead and they began
[2:08:50] to do that
[2:08:51] and they began to exercise the authority
[2:08:53] they gave them to begin to preach the
[2:08:54] word for their hour
[2:08:56] and when they began to preach the word
[2:08:57] for their hour jesus said i beheld satan
[2:09:00] as lightning falling from heaven
[2:09:04] he was seeing the future friends as the
[2:09:06] bride comes into her position and
[2:09:08] doesn't let the devil push her around
[2:09:09] but stays in the promises of god
[2:09:12] doesn't get derailed by hardships and
[2:09:14] difficulties
[2:09:15] and the world doing what the world will
[2:09:17] do she stays true to this word
[2:09:20] she stays in her position she preaches
[2:09:22] what god's given her to preach
[2:09:27] in the seventh seal the prophet of god
[2:09:31] says paragraph 63 and the seventh seal
[2:09:34] now remember after the fourth chapter of
[2:09:36] revelations the church is gone
[2:09:38] the four horse riders has sent out
[2:09:40] church is gone everything has happened
[2:09:41] to the church happen
[2:09:42] up to the fourth chapter of the book of
[2:09:44] revelations everything that happened in
[2:09:45] the antichrist move
[2:09:46] went up to the fourth chapter and the
[2:09:48] fourth seal of the revelation both for
[2:09:50] the antichrist and the christ ended up
[2:09:52] an antichrist comes to his doom with his
[2:09:54] army and christ comes with his army
[2:09:57] it's an old battle that started way back
[2:10:00] beyond time
[2:10:02] satan and his angels was kicked out and
[2:10:04] then they come to the earth and the
[2:10:06] battle set in again
[2:10:07] because eve broke down the barrier from
[2:10:09] where she was isolated behind the word
[2:10:10] of god
[2:10:11] and from that very hour satan won the
[2:10:14] battle over
[2:10:15] god's word because one of his subjects
[2:10:18] the weaker
[2:10:19] let down the bar and that's exactly how
[2:10:22] he's won the battle
[2:10:23] every time has been because one of his
[2:10:26] subjects
[2:10:26] let down the bar from the word
[2:10:31] how did he win the battle in eden one of
[2:10:33] god's subjects the weaker vessel the
[2:10:35] woman
[2:10:36] let down the bar and from that time on
[2:10:40] satan
[2:10:42] won the battle over god's word
[2:10:46] so what's the fight the fight
[2:10:49] is between satan and the word of god
[2:10:52] the battle is between satan and the word
[2:10:55] he's trying to get victory over the word
[2:10:57] amen
[2:10:58] because that word is the thing that
[2:10:59] defeats him how does he get victory over
[2:11:01] the word
[2:11:02] when he can get one subject to let down
[2:11:04] on one word
[2:11:05] how many eve how many words that eve let
[2:11:07] down on brother said one word
[2:11:09] when one subject let down on one word
[2:11:11] then satan's got victory over the word
[2:11:13] of god
[2:11:14] how many of god's attributes does it
[2:11:16] take to let down the bar on the word
[2:11:18] for satan to still have victory over the
[2:11:20] word and remain an accuser of the
[2:11:22] brethren
[2:11:23] it just takes you
[2:11:26] remember to think now think brother
[2:11:28] branham taught us in
[2:11:30] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[2:11:32] says god had one goal
[2:11:34] one purpose one thing he wanted to
[2:11:35] achieve in the whole bible
[2:11:37] and all of the characters and all the
[2:11:38] types of the whole bible has been
[2:11:40] telling this one goal that god's had
[2:11:43] and that's a threefold purpose and the
[2:11:45] first was to get preeminence on a man
[2:11:46] he did that in christ jesus second is to
[2:11:49] get preeminence in a people a bride he's
[2:11:51] doing that now
[2:11:52] third is to restore the kingdom to eden
[2:11:55] to an eaten condition so that means
[2:11:58] your entire bible everything your bible
[2:12:02] was supposed to express
[2:12:04] every type every shadow everything every
[2:12:07] character in the bible was trying to
[2:12:08] show
[2:12:09] has come down to this god having
[2:12:12] preeminence in you
[2:12:16] don't say the bride if you're part of
[2:12:19] the bride
[2:12:20] don't make it easy don't say for all the
[2:12:22] bride no the whole purpose of this was
[2:12:24] for him to have preeminence and the
[2:12:25] people and i'm one of those people
[2:12:27] everything god was doing was so that he
[2:12:29] could restore the woman
[2:12:30] amen to restore the fallen condition he
[2:12:32] had to restore the man
[2:12:34] he did that through christ jesus now is
[2:12:36] restoring the woman and he's got to have
[2:12:37] full preeminence till there's a people
[2:12:39] on this earth that are not letting down
[2:12:41] the bar
[2:12:41] on the word anymore they're not being
[2:12:44] deceived they're not
[2:12:45] they're not they're not they're not
[2:12:47] falling by deception they're not being
[2:12:48] beguiled anymore by the devil
[2:12:50] so he restored his word so that he can
[2:12:52] restore the woman
[2:12:54] and now god's whole plan has come down
[2:12:56] to me
[2:12:57] sticking with this word hallelujah
[2:13:01] god god in an eating condition he kept
[2:13:04] him in an eaten condition by his word
[2:13:07] so satan come in to get one subject to
[2:13:10] let down the word
[2:13:11] amen and then satan got victory over the
[2:13:13] word so now god's trying to bring back
[2:13:15] an even condition
[2:13:16] so he brought back the man and he
[2:13:18] brought back the woman and he restored
[2:13:20] the word because he has to restore the
[2:13:22] word to restore eden
[2:13:25] and she's going to be tested by the word
[2:13:28] but she's predestinated not to fall
[2:13:32] amen she's pre-dead this
[2:13:35] bride is predestinated not to fall
[2:13:42] that's how he's won the battle every
[2:13:44] time
[2:13:45] has been because one of his subjects let
[2:13:47] that debar from the word
[2:13:51] and the message the spirit of truth he
[2:13:52] says he's interested in you
[2:13:55] he's interested in me he's interested to
[2:13:57] see his word made manifest
[2:13:59] and he's depending on us to do it for we
[2:14:02] are his agents
[2:14:04] nothing in ourselves it's him yielding
[2:14:06] ourselves
[2:14:07] walking with him it's not us it's not
[2:14:10] what we do
[2:14:11] it's what we surrender ourselves to it's
[2:14:13] a dying to self it's a yielding to this
[2:14:15] word that he's given us
[2:14:17] and let the life of the word come and
[2:14:18] live in us
[2:14:20] and live his word through us
[2:14:24] brother branham he has this experience
[2:14:28] i want to close with sharing this story
[2:14:30] and then the scripture but
[2:14:31] brother rem has the experience of going
[2:14:33] beyond the curtain of time
[2:14:34] and do you remember how that experience
[2:14:36] starts off brother branham is laying in
[2:14:38] bed
[2:14:38] and he says i heard a voice say to me
[2:14:41] keep pressing
[2:14:43] that's how this whole experience we know
[2:14:45] he goes beyond the current of time
[2:14:46] he sees hope he sees the woman that was
[2:14:48] 80 years old that comes to him and says
[2:14:50] my precious brother
[2:14:50] he sees the men come running and the
[2:14:52] women come running they put him on the
[2:14:54] pedestal
[2:14:55] amen and because he was a leader on
[2:14:56] earth and he talks all about you will
[2:14:58] come to you first and you'll be judged
[2:14:59] we'll be judged with you
[2:15:00] he has all that experience he sees his
[2:15:02] horse and his dog
[2:15:03] there but how did that experience start
[2:15:07] he said there was a voice that said keep
[2:15:09] pressing
[2:15:11] keep pressing and he says from the
[2:15:14] message from that time and i heard
[2:15:15] something say keep pressing on
[2:15:18] and i said i will press on i said would
[2:15:20] you like to see past the curtain
[2:15:23] i said it would help me why did god show
[2:15:27] him beyond the curtain of time
[2:15:29] so that he would keep pressing on he did
[2:15:30] it to help him
[2:15:34] and just then i felt something happened
[2:15:35] to me and i thought what's the matter
[2:15:37] here
[2:15:37] and i look back i could see myself
[2:15:39] laying in the bed
[2:15:40] he's moving beyond the curtain of time
[2:15:44] and i don't want to i'm not going to
[2:15:45] read the whole story but i'm coming down
[2:15:46] to the end
[2:15:48] paragraph 105 he said i want to he says
[2:15:50] i want to see jesus i want to see the
[2:15:52] one that i've loved and worked for
[2:15:54] and they said you can't see him right
[2:15:56] now he's higher than this
[2:15:58] but someday he will come back and when
[2:16:00] he comes
[2:16:01] he will come to you first and you'll be
[2:16:03] questioned on the gospel that you
[2:16:05] preached
[2:16:06] and if you pass the test then we will go
[2:16:08] back then we will
[2:16:09] go with you back to him back to earth
[2:16:11] and live together forever in a body
[2:16:13] a fleshly body where we'll eat and drink
[2:16:17] listen those saints had gone they had
[2:16:19] done their time on earth they had gone
[2:16:21] through their earthly journey and now
[2:16:22] they've gone to the sixth dimension and
[2:16:24] were
[2:16:24] in their theophonic body and
[2:16:27] and you think they have arrived they
[2:16:32] have arrived they are in the destination
[2:16:34] they are in perfect peace
[2:16:35] perfect love perfect brother said
[2:16:37] there's no human words to explain what
[2:16:39] was there
[2:16:39] it was just perfect love
[2:16:42] they're there in that realm and he
[2:16:45] begins to talk to them and ask him do
[2:16:46] you he said no
[2:16:47] but when when when everything's over
[2:16:49] christ will come to you you'll be judged
[2:16:51] by the word you preach and
[2:16:52] then we'll go back and glorify bodies
[2:16:54] then we'll go back on the earth then
[2:16:56] we'll eat and drink
[2:16:57] and you realize these people in the
[2:16:59] sixth dimension are looking for
[2:17:01] something else
[2:17:02] they haven't arrived their journey isn't
[2:17:05] over they're not finished they want
[2:17:07] more they want because we're never right
[2:17:09] until we're a perfect tri-human being
[2:17:11] we're never right till we're a
[2:17:13] born-again perfect redeemed soul
[2:17:15] garth theophany body and a glorified
[2:17:17] body all united together
[2:17:18] until then our journey is not done and
[2:17:21] they're looking
[2:17:22] brother madam just got there he doesn't
[2:17:24] want to leave
[2:17:25] because i begin to feel funny and i look
[2:17:27] back and my body begins to move and he
[2:17:29] says
[2:17:30] do i have to go he didn't want to go
[2:17:34] but these people who are there they're
[2:17:36] looking forward to the future and say
[2:17:38] someday he'll come and get us and we'll
[2:17:40] go back to glorified bodies they
[2:17:42] want to go to the next step
[2:17:45] they're desiring to move on not that
[2:17:47] they're unhappy in this place but it's
[2:17:49] not the finished work yet
[2:17:51] we've got to go back to fullness of
[2:17:52] redemption it's not the fullness yet
[2:17:54] they're looking forward to coming back
[2:17:58] but they're encouraging brother branham
[2:18:00] keep pressing on
[2:18:01] go back they want him to go finish his
[2:18:04] work
[2:18:05] because if he finishes their his work
[2:18:08] they're closer to going back to those
[2:18:09] glorified bodies
[2:18:12] he said then we'll go back i said you
[2:18:15] mean
[2:18:16] he will question me on the word i
[2:18:17] preached he said yes and the voice spoke
[2:18:19] to me and said
[2:18:21] the voice speaking to me said it and i
[2:18:24] said well well saint paul be questioned
[2:18:26] too
[2:18:26] he said certainly with this congregation
[2:18:28] i said then if saint paul
[2:18:30] passes it i will too i preached just
[2:18:32] exactly the way he did
[2:18:34] not moved one word and those millions
[2:18:37] scream down
[2:18:38] we know that and we're resting assured
[2:18:42] and about that time i heard the voice
[2:18:43] say keep pressing on
[2:18:47] keep pressing on i felt myself
[2:18:51] slip i said i don't have to go back do i
[2:18:55] keep pressing on and i turned and looked
[2:18:57] at my body i seen it move
[2:18:59] i was coming to in just a moment i was
[2:19:01] in the room again
[2:19:04] brother branham was taken beyond the
[2:19:05] curtain of time to see those that had
[2:19:07] passed on before
[2:19:08] to encourage him to keep pressing on it
[2:19:11] was important that he pressed on
[2:19:13] it was important that he finished the
[2:19:14] work god gave him to do it was important
[2:19:16] that he delivered the message
[2:19:17] this was in 1960 he still had to come to
[2:19:20] the seals yet
[2:19:20] he still had to come to 64 and 65 and
[2:19:23] preach the son of man and preach the
[2:19:24] third poll and show us the opening of
[2:19:26] the seventh seal so that you and i
[2:19:28] could keep pressing on so that we could
[2:19:30] live our part so that we could fulfill
[2:19:31] the part for our day
[2:19:32] because they're all over there crying
[2:19:35] press on
[2:19:36] press on press on they don't want us
[2:19:39] fooling around with the world
[2:19:40] they don't want us playing games they
[2:19:42] don't want us distracted
[2:19:43] they want us to keep pressing on friends
[2:19:47] this message came to give us victory
[2:19:49] over deception to give us victory
[2:19:51] over the pollution of the word this
[2:19:53] message came to bring us back in line
[2:19:55] with our headship
[2:19:56] our husband the word so that we're no
[2:19:58] longer letting down the bar on the word
[2:20:00] so that the accuser the brother can be
[2:20:02] cast down because when the bride goes up
[2:20:04] he comes down it means when the bride
[2:20:07] goes up he's got
[2:20:08] nothing else to accuse them of he has
[2:20:11] not got a position anymore in heaven
[2:20:13] as the accuser of the brethren
[2:20:17] i'm determined to live all that god gave
[2:20:20] me to live i'm determined to give my
[2:20:22] whole life to this word
[2:20:23] because he's got to lose his position as
[2:20:26] accuser of the brother
[2:20:27] i don't want to let down on this word no
[2:20:28] more i say god
[2:20:30] help me i'm giving you my whole life god
[2:20:32] come and live this word through me i
[2:20:34] can't do it myself
[2:20:35] but i'm laying myself afresh on the
[2:20:37] altar to die all over again
[2:20:39] consume the sacrifice and live through
[2:20:41] me because the user of the brethren is
[2:20:43] going to lose his position
[2:20:47] as the bride goes up satan comes down
[2:20:51] brother branham is singing a song and a
[2:20:53] message and he begins to sing
[2:20:55] and he said and the bride goes up word
[2:20:58] by word oh are you being lifted up word
[2:21:02] by word
[2:21:02] revelation upon revelation word by word
[2:21:05] are you moving into the heavenly realm
[2:21:07] is the earthly things losing its grip on

[2:23:28] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[2:23:29] earth
[2:23:30] and these all having obtained a good
[2:23:32] report through faith received not the
[2:23:34] promise

[2:23:56] brother branham said in the message the
[2:23:58] token paragraph
[2:24:00] 89 and the church in this day that's
[2:24:03] received the token of the baptism of the
[2:24:05] holy spirit
[2:24:06] that the blood has been shed and that
[2:24:08] the holy ghost is upon the church
[2:24:10] without us
[2:24:11] then they cannot raise but they're
[2:24:13] depending on us for god's promise he
[2:24:15] would have it
[2:24:16] and somebody is going to be there i
[2:24:18] don't know who it's going to be but
[2:24:19] somebody is going to receive it
[2:24:21] the only one thing i'm responsible is to
[2:24:23] preach it it's god's business to look
[2:24:25] out for the predestinated seed
[2:24:27] there's going to be there though because
[2:24:28] they're going to be there each one of
[2:24:30] them
[2:24:31] one with the other the water age the
[2:24:33] blood age and now the token age
[2:24:35] of the holy ghost and the pergament
[2:24:38] church age the section where brother
[2:24:40] brennan was told to pick up his pen and
[2:24:41] right
[2:24:41] and the angel of the lord began to use
[2:24:43] his hand to write out a message to us
[2:24:45] i just want to read a small portion of
[2:24:47] that
[2:24:49] it says those in the bride do only his
[2:24:51] will
[2:24:52] no one can make them do otherwise listen
[2:24:56] friends
[2:24:57] nobody can make you do otherwise
[2:25:02] you've been given free choice you've
[2:25:05] been given
[2:25:06] free moral agency and free choice and so
[2:25:09] now it's your
[2:25:10] right by god to exercise your free
[2:25:12] choice
[2:25:13] to keep the word amen nobody can make
[2:25:16] you do otherwise
[2:25:18] oh that does something for me free moral
[2:25:21] agency wasn't given to me so that i can
[2:25:23] choose my own way
[2:25:24] that i can make a choice like eve that i
[2:25:25] can satisfy the flesh and i can
[2:25:27] entertain myself
[2:25:28] and chase the world that's not why
[2:25:30] preeminence was given to me
[2:25:31] preeminence was given to me so nobody
[2:25:34] could take my
[2:25:35] right away to choose god and to choose
[2:25:38] his word
[2:25:39] and nobody can make me do otherwise
[2:25:42] they have thus saith the lord or they
[2:25:43] keep still they know that it has to be
[2:25:45] god in them doing the works
[2:25:47] fulfilling his own word he did not
[2:25:49] complete all his work while in his
[2:25:50] earthly ministry
[2:25:52] what was his work to seek and to save
[2:25:54] that which was lost
[2:25:55] to reconcile
[2:25:58] he did not complete all his work while
[2:26:00] in his earthly ministry so now
[2:26:02] he works in and through the bride she
[2:26:04] knows that for it was not yet time for
[2:26:06] him to do certain things that he must
[2:26:08] now do
[2:26:09] but he will now fulfill through the
[2:26:11] bride that work which he left
[2:26:13] for this specific time amen
[2:26:17] they're still part of the ministry of
[2:26:18] christ that's going on today
[2:26:20] and he left it for this specific time
[2:26:23] and he left it for a specific people
[2:26:26] and we are those people
[2:26:30] brother branham says in the first seal
[2:26:32] but in revelation 12
[2:26:34] 7-9 satan the spirit the devil which is
[2:26:38] up there now accuser of our brethren all
[2:26:40] right the church is taken up and satan
[2:26:42] is cast out
[2:26:43] when the church goes up satan comes down
[2:26:49] he's no longer the accuser of the
[2:26:51] brethren
[2:26:52] they have kept all the word they have
[2:26:54] believed the word they have surrendered
[2:26:56] to the word the last predestinated seed
[2:26:58] came
[2:26:58] in and believed the word and when all
[2:27:00] the seed of god has surrendered to the
[2:27:02] full revelation of the word of god
[2:27:04] she goes up he comes down
[2:27:08] i say god i'm surrendering all to you
[2:27:10] now i'm surrendering all of myself to
[2:27:12] you almighty god

[2:30:10] when i was a child
[2:30:17] even licking the plate wasn't
[2:30:21] wasn't acceptable
[2:30:24] but when you were when i was a child
[2:30:26] that was
[2:30:27] one way of showing it was delicious
[2:30:30] you didn't even want nothing to be
[2:30:33] washed away
[2:30:35] you want it to consume everything
[2:30:38] and that's basically the way i feel
[2:30:40] tonight
[2:30:42] even though you didn't see me licking
[2:30:44] the plate
[2:30:46] that's what i was doing in the back
[2:30:47] there
[2:30:49] truly the message has been
[2:30:53] beyond beyond
[2:30:56] it there is no way to express what god
[2:30:59] did for
[2:31:00] us tonight if if we received what was
[2:31:03] being said
[2:31:05] uh it was the kind of message that
[2:31:08] grabbed a hold of you and locked you in
[2:31:11] at least that's what it did for me and
[2:31:15] you know i don't to worry about changing
[2:31:17] because what i heard tonight would
[2:31:19] change me
[2:31:21] when you receive the word the word
[2:31:24] changes you
[2:31:25] so we thank god for that we're going to
