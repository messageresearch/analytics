[5:25] welcome here. Amen. Hallelujah. I just
[5:28] have a also
[5:31] a prayer request for sister from the
[5:34] Brookses, Sister Ruby. We had they have
[5:36] a friend down in Texas. Her name is
[5:38] April. Uh and April was in a a car
[5:42] accident with two little children. Uh
[5:45] she seems like she got the worst of it.
[5:47] Um basically she was distracted by the
[5:50] children and a turn and got thrown off
[5:53] the road and hit some trees, got
[5:55] airlifted and I think they brought her
[5:57] back four or five times from death. and
[6:01] she has these I think three or four
[6:04] children to raise. So she's in the
[6:06] process right now of having surgery. Uh
[6:10] and I just want us to uh you know as we
[6:13] bring this we open with with prayer here
[6:15] that we remember April you know when
[6:19] Jesus you know was told of something
[6:22] that was going on it it affected him
[6:25] right away. when they came to him and
[6:28] told him Lazarus is dying, you know, you
[6:31] know, he he wept is what what the Bible
[6:35] said and then he went into action. The
[6:38] Bible said and then the Lord told him
[6:40] what to do
[6:42] and and he knew what he had to do. So,
[6:44] you know, in this day, it's Christ in us
[6:48] and Christ in his bride. Amen. Jesus
[6:52] might not be here walking on earth.
[6:54] Amen. But that's why the Holy Ghost for
[6:56] each one of us. Amen. So, let's just
[6:59] Amen. As Jesus took this information
[7:03] from about Lazarus, let's take this from
[7:06] April. We don't know April, but friends
[7:09] of brother Brooks. Amen. So, let's just
[7:11] take that to a prayer. Amen. Let's bow
[7:14] our heads.

[31:37] become an invincible army.
[31:41] This this knowing who she is
[31:44] comes by a revelation
[31:47] uh intimacy with God. That's the only
[31:50] way you'll know. It won't be a knowledge
[31:52] in your head.
[31:56] Your spirit can fail you,
[31:59] right? But your soul says, "Amen."
[32:03] Right? So we thank God for his goodness.
[32:06] Genesis 1 27:31.
[32:17] You know, I think about how great God is
[32:22] and how small we are.
[32:26] It it it uh learning or trying to
[32:29] comprehend
[32:33] his love for us
[32:36] seem to be so uncomprehensible.
[32:43] Because even in our love for each other
[32:45] is limited.
[32:50] But God loves go beyond.
[32:53] Like I said, he's so wide. Can't go
[32:56] around so high. Can't go over it. So
[33:00] low. You can't go under it.
[33:03] It's amazing.
[33:06] Genesis 1:27:31
[33:11] it says, "So God created man in his own
[33:14] image, in the image of God created he
[33:16] him. Male and female created he them."
[33:25] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[33:27] them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and
[33:29] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[33:32] have dominion over the fish, and of the
[33:34] sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
[33:36] over every living thing that moveth upon
[33:38] the earth." Amen.
[33:52] And God said, "Behold, I have given you
[33:54] every herb bearing seed, which is upon
[33:58] the face of the earth, and every tree in
[34:01] the which is the fruit of the tree,
[34:03] yielding seed, to you it shall be for
[34:06] meat.
[34:19] And to every beast of the earth, and to
[34:21] every foul of the air, and to everything
[34:24] that creepeth upon the earth, wherein
[34:26] there is life, I have given every green
[34:29] herb for meat. And it was so.
[34:43] And God saw everything that he had made.
[34:47] And behold, it was very good. And the
[34:49] evening and the morning were the sixth
[34:51] day.
[35:02] We'll go to
[35:04] Um,
[35:07] let's let's just go here.
[35:18] Bear with me. Just Colossians
[35:22] the second chapter
[35:26] the ninth and 10th verse.
[35:33] Amen. You love the Lord.
[35:36] Amen. We just appreciate the Lord for
[35:38] what he's doing
[35:41] and what he has done in these last days.
[35:46] For in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[35:49] the Godhead bodily,
[35:55] and ye are complete in him.
[35:57] Amen.
[36:00] which is the head of all principality
[36:03] and power.
[36:08] Amen.
[36:09] Amen.
[36:09] When we think about being complete in
[36:12] him,
[36:15] it's being filled with him.
[36:20] Now you stand as a complete house.
[36:26] Amen. You love the Lord. Let us have a
[36:29] word of prayer.
[36:31] Dear heavenly father god,
[36:34] we do come before you Lord as humble as
[36:35] we know how.
[36:38] We thank you for this time opportunity
[36:41] to approach your word.
[36:45] We are an unworthy creature,
[36:49] but we are worthy only because you have
[36:51] made us worthy
[36:55] through the blood of your dear son Jesus
[36:57] Christ.
[36:59] And so we thank you Lord God tonight.
[37:01] Hallelujah
[37:03] for being our all and all.
[37:06] Words cannot express our gratitude.
[37:10] Cannot even comprehend the love that you
[37:12] have for us.
[37:16] But I pray tonight that this love
[37:20] will consume all of us
[37:24] Lord from the bottom of our feet to the
[37:27] top of our head
[37:29] in our body and our soul and in our
[37:31] spirit.
[37:34] So let it be Lord Jesus.
[37:37] This is our desire to be just like you.
[37:41] In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[37:44] Amen.
[37:45] Amen.
[37:46] You may be seated.
[37:48] Having that assurance.
[37:51] Good to see you, brother Jim.
[37:54] God bless you, too.
[37:56] We thank God for being so real to us.
[38:00] As I say, the message continue on.
[38:04] It's forever opening up. It's forever
[38:07] unveiling itself.
[38:10] And you know this message is Jesus
[38:13] Christ.
[38:14] So you'll know it'll never have an
[38:16] ending.
[38:19] The natural things of life may end.
[38:24] But this message or this
[38:28] will will continue.
[38:31] for an example. We're now sitting here
[38:35] in Iowa
[38:39] mo Iowa.
[38:42] But the Bible has also declared us
[38:46] to be in heaven already.
[38:49] You understand me? It it doesn't stop
[38:52] here.
[38:54] And we have a journey. We have a
[38:55] destiny.
[38:58] And this word is our road map. It's
[39:01] literally guiding us and showing us the
[39:04] way to reach that on the other side.
[39:09] Now, we always say that Satan is
[39:11] defeated.
[39:14] But not only is Satan defeated,
[39:17] but when we look in the Bible,
[39:19] we can see the very end of the devil.
[39:23] So, he has a journey too.
[39:26] And God predestinated these journeys,
[39:29] these destinies.
[39:32] And these destinies were were as brother
[39:34] Brandham said
[39:37] were were were made so
[39:41] by by our free will and our decision
[39:45] before the foundation of the world.
[39:49] So when you say my subject tonight,
[39:54] God made me this way.
[39:58] He made you this way.
[40:02] And we ought to be happy about the way
[40:04] God has made us.
[40:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It doesn't
[40:10] matter. This outward appearance
[40:14] means nothing.
[40:17] is the inward man that we ought to be
[40:20] concerned with
[40:24] being in the image and likeness of God.
[40:28] Uh we know that this outer man
[40:32] what God is. Uh when Moses wanted to see
[40:36] God,
[40:38] God told him he couldn't see his face.
[40:43] But hide yourself in the cliff of the
[40:45] rock
[40:47] and I will pass by.
[40:50] And when Moses saw God,
[40:54] he saw the back of a man.
[40:57] Brother Brandham says, God is a man.
[41:02] Now remember this, in the beginning, God
[41:05] was just spirit.
[41:08] And there's no way to describe him.
[41:12] He was a fountain of everything that was
[41:14] beautiful,
[41:16] everything that was good, everything
[41:19] that was lovely.
[41:20] There was no darkness in him.
[41:24] Matter of fact, he was the one who
[41:25] created dark.
[41:28] Hallelujah. I'm saying all of these
[41:31] things because our minds really we try
[41:34] to grab it. We we try to hold on to it.
[41:38] But you you must understand that God set
[41:41] this thing in a way.
[41:43] The only way that you can understand
[41:45] this
[41:47] is by faith.
[41:50] And when you believe God, God will then
[41:53] reveal to youh
[41:55] [Music]
[41:57] that which you can't see with your eyes.
[42:01] For an example, brother Brandham never
[42:04] knew he was going to the next dimension.
[42:10] And and think about it, you know, God
[42:13] took him to another dimension,
[42:17] not at the beginning of his ministry,
[42:20] almost at the end of it.
[42:24] So you can understand, he needed a
[42:27] little boost, too.
[42:31] He said, "Lord, I'm I'm I'm 50ome years
[42:33] old."
[42:35] Oh, man.
[42:37] I don't have much time to to to live. If
[42:41] I'm going to do anything for God, I got
[42:44] to be about my father's business.
[42:47] And every time I hear him say that,
[42:51] I'm like, "Okay, that therefore
[42:54] in order to find me, you're going to
[42:56] have to use a microscope."
[43:00] And I don't say that in in a joking way.
[43:03] It is a reality
[43:05] when we see
[43:08] what brother the Lord used what God did
[43:10] through him
[43:13] and it didn't stop when he went on to
[43:15] glory
[43:17] it continue on
[43:20] people are still being saved under this
[43:22] message
[43:24] and the bride is still being called
[43:28] but it was because one man
[43:31] was made a certain way.
[43:36] All of us are not made prophets.
[43:40] Our conscious and subconscious does not
[43:42] just blend together.
[43:46] But this this man,
[43:48] William Brandham, William
[43:50] was uh uh created
[43:52] and designed
[43:55] to be able to see and hear things
[44:01] that the average Christian can't see.
[44:08] You understand? Paul was a similar type
[44:11] of man.
[44:13] [Music]
[44:14] But Paul even came to say,
[44:16] "We no longer know uh Jesus Christ after
[44:20] the flesh,
[44:23] but after the spirit."
[44:26] Because the spirit can take you further
[44:30] and higher than any fleshly man can do.
[44:35] Hallelujah.
[44:36] You know, brother Brandham laying on his
[44:38] bed
[44:40] you know, didn't ask God, can I see
[44:43] heaven?
[44:45] The Lord came to him.
[44:48] He pushed the button and took the
[44:50] astronaut
[44:52] beyond the curtain of time.
[44:55] So that you understand
[44:57] you have been designed
[44:59] in a certain way that when God get ready
[45:02] to push your button,
[45:06] you're going to go exactly where he
[45:08] wants you to go.
[45:12] All of us want we want that adoption.
[45:16] We we want to see the fullness of
[45:18] Christ.
[45:21] But if you listen to the message,
[45:24] the prophet God said it won't be by
[45:26] somebody laying their hands on you.
[45:30] He said, "You can be in the kitchen. You
[45:33] can be at work. You can be wherever."
[45:38] Hallelujah. And then God will come to
[45:41] you. Oh, somebody help me here. I'm
[45:44] trying not to get excited. But God will
[45:47] then come to you.
[45:50] And then he will set you in that place
[45:54] and he will cause heaven
[45:56] to bow down to you.
[45:59] See, it's all God cuz none of us know
[46:02] when we're ready.
[46:04] We don't know when I can when everything
[46:08] is complete.
[46:10] Only God knows.
[46:12] But they that wait upon the Lord.
[46:16] See, we got to understand we're made a
[46:19] certain way.
[46:21] Hallelujah. There are people out there
[46:25] who never thirst for God.
[46:28] Oh my God. I feel his presence. But you
[46:31] have been made
[46:33] to thirst for God. Hallelujah. It's not
[46:37] about you. It's about how you've been
[46:40] made.
[46:41] He made you to thirst after him.
[46:45] Hallelujah. And then he said, "Whosoever
[46:49] hunger and thirst after me
[46:52] shall be filled."
[46:54] Hallelujah. This is how you identify
[46:58] who you are in this hour. God, I want
[47:02] more of you every day. I want more of
[47:07] you. That thirst that you have, God gave
[47:12] it to you and he promised to fill you
[47:16] in his time.
[47:20] He made us this way.
[47:23] We can't help it.
[47:25] I don't want to stop it.
[47:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[47:29] Listen. Coming from the message question
[47:32] and answers on Genesis
[47:36] uh uh year 53.
[47:40] 0729.
[47:43] 0729.
[47:48] And the prophet of God said this in the
[47:50] 21st verse.
[47:53] We got to understand we got to love who
[47:55] he made us. We we must love what he made
[47:58] us.
[48:01] You say, "Brother, but what about all my
[48:02] faults?"
[48:04] That's his permissive will.
[48:07] But he made you that way.
[48:12] He know every fault you have,
[48:15] every little thing that goes wrong with
[48:17] you.
[48:20] He's not throwing his mouth hand up to
[48:21] his mouth like I can't believe it.
[48:25] No, he knows the beginning from the
[48:27] ending.
[48:30] Don't let the devil condemn you.
[48:34] Hallelujah.
[48:35] Hallelujah. We didn't ask to come this
[48:37] way.
[48:39] Because of Adam and Eve, we are now
[48:40] plunged into this.
[48:43] Hallelujah.
[48:45] And out of all the bodies in the world,
[48:49] this age has the most hybrid bodies
[48:54] ever.
[48:57] Y'all understand me?
[48:59] You were made in an age where brother
[49:03] Brandham said
[49:06] the majority of the people in this
[49:07] generation
[49:10] will have rotted brains.
[49:14] Insane.
[49:18] They can't help it.
[49:20] The word has gone out.
[49:23] He didn't say how it was going to
[49:24] happen.
[49:26] We know how it has happened.
[49:29] through all the food, through the water,
[49:32] through everything.
[49:34] Satan is making his Eden.
[49:38] You understand me?
[49:39] And all of his children is insane.
[49:43] Yes.
[49:44] But he made you different.
[49:49] He has kept your mind
[49:51] from insanity.
[49:54] Hallelujah. Y'all know it's true. Many
[49:57] times the devil want to push you to
[49:59] insanity
[50:01] and God said not. So
[50:04] he comes right in on time.
[50:07] He's a mind fixer and a hard regulator.
[50:13] He made you this way because instead of
[50:16] allowing him, the devil to take you
[50:19] over, guess what we do? We call on Jesus
[50:25] and he's made us that way.
[50:29] It's like a child when they in trouble.
[50:31] Mama, daddy.
[50:34] Yes. That's what we do automatically.
[50:38] And he always comes.
[50:42] Hallelujah.
[50:43] Hallelujah. Amen.
[50:44] Now,
[50:46] I won't say God doesn't allow people to
[50:50] go through mental battles,
[50:53] stress,
[50:56] and brother said, "You could be totally
[50:57] insane.
[51:00] They still have the Holy Ghost.
[51:04] He made us this way.
[51:09] people who even go through Alzheimer's.
[51:13] Alzheimer's
[51:17] Alzheimer's.
[51:18] Yes, they go through it.
[51:21] But if they have a if they have a love
[51:22] of God in their soul,
[51:25] they might forget your name, but they
[51:28] won't forget Jesus.
[51:31] You try it. Go in there, say something
[51:33] about Jesus, and see won't they wake up.
[51:38] You see what I'm saying? God, we're made
[51:41] this way.
[51:43] We're made this. I'm so happy to be made
[51:46] in the image and likeness of God.
[51:50] I'm so happy to know my future. Y'all
[51:54] better hear what I said. I am so happy
[51:57] to know my future.
[52:00] And every true believer of this message,
[52:03] you ought to be happy because God has
[52:06] already told you your future.
[52:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We don't go to
[52:12] hell. We go up.
[52:16] We're made this way.
[52:19] That's why we were born in this uh not
[52:21] only this age. This is why we're born in
[52:24] this age. Cool to the devil.
[52:28] You worked your works for thousands of
[52:30] years,
[52:33] but this group
[52:35] that you wanted the most
[52:38] you can't touch. Y'all hear what I'm
[52:41] saying? Why? Because this group,
[52:44] it has been revealed to them that their
[52:48] names were written on the lamb's book of
[52:52] life before the foundation of the world.
[52:56] So you understand
[52:58] he can't lose you.
[53:02] He can't lose you.
[53:04] You have already
[53:06] made it.
[53:08] That's the truth.
[53:10] Praise the Lord.
[53:10] Is that not what brother preached?
[53:13] Why? He said, why do you worry?
[53:17] Amen.
[53:18] Why worry?
[53:20] If you truly is chosen by God,
[53:25] Let me ask you something.
[53:28] There's not one, let me say it like
[53:29] this. There's not one person in here who
[53:33] can say I did this and I did that.
[53:37] And that's what makes me buy.
[53:41] Every one of us know
[53:44] is by the grace of God.
[53:47] You know what? If you be honest with
[53:49] you,
[53:50] you don't even fully understand
[53:52] election.
[53:53] [Music]
[53:54] and you're glad you've been elected.
[54:00] It's amazing that we could love a word
[54:06] that the world hates.
[54:09] We can have fellowship
[54:12] around a word
[54:14] that all hell hates.
[54:19] What is it about you?
[54:22] Amen. He designed you differently.
[54:27] Hallelujah. Can I say it like this? You
[54:30] might look faulty,
[54:35] but but of all the men and women of all
[54:38] ages,
[54:41] you are the greatest. Could I say like
[54:45] if we we dealt with models of computers?
[54:48] [Music]
[54:51] Let's say it like this because you can
[54:52] you can kind of comprehend that. You are
[54:55] the most advanced
[54:58] of all the computers.
[55:00] You understand what I mean? Of all men.
[55:04] You are the most advanced.
[55:08] All men.
[55:11] because you get the greater portion.
[55:16] And God designed you this way.
[55:19] Hallelujah.
[55:21] Amen.
[55:22] I'm glad to be designed this way
[55:25] that not only can I hear the word, I can
[55:26] see the word.
[55:29] I can read the word.
[55:32] So this generation that can see and hear
[55:34] and believe.
[55:37] Look all the look at look look at all
[55:39] the blessings
[55:41] that comes with that.
[55:44] Now, let me get back to my quote
[55:47] question and answers on Genesis
[55:50] 530729.
[55:55] Now, if God created man in his own
[55:57] image,
[55:59] in his own likeness,
[56:02] what kind of a man did he create?
[56:06] A spirit man.
[56:08] Amen. Amen.
[56:09] So can I say it like this? I believe
[56:12] this is the way brother Adam said it.
[56:15] When God created Adam,
[56:17] he created them all. In other words
[56:21] spirit-wise, you were created.
[56:25] God brought Adam.
[56:27] You understand me? So when you die, God
[56:31] ain't just creating something.
[56:33] When you die, you already have a
[56:36] theophony.
[56:39] And that theophony was not created when
[56:41] you die.
[56:43] That theophony came all the way back
[56:45] before the before time. You understand
[56:48] what I'm trying to say?
[56:50] So you'll understand that you just did
[56:52] not happen
[56:55] to come to earth.
[56:57] God had a purpose. You have a destiny
[57:02] and that purpose is to reflect Jesus
[57:04] Christ.
[57:06] God himself,
[57:09] right?
[57:10] So he created spirit man.
[57:13] But guess what happened?
[57:15] When Adam and Eve sin,
[57:19] they also put our soul to a judgment.
[57:24] And that judgment was death.
[57:28] So really when you were born, you were
[57:29] born dead.
[57:33] Yeah. Yeah. Your soul was not living.
[57:37] It had to be quickened.
[57:41] And brother Bannon said in the soul
[57:46] is either God or dove
[57:55] or a serpent.
[57:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:00] So let me say it like this so you
[58:02] understand what I'm saying. When you
[58:04] were born in the flesh,
[58:08] you had a seed already in you.
[58:13] And that seed was sown
[58:16] before the foundation of the world.
[58:20] That's a parable. The swer went out and
[58:23] he sold seed.
[58:27] Hallelujah. Is that right? Oh,
[58:30] let me break it down to you like this.
[58:33] When a man could not believe, he said,
[58:35] "Brother Brandham,"
[58:37] he a man said, "Brother Brandon,
[58:40] even if I could see it, I won't
[58:41] believe."
[58:44] What did Brother Brandham say? He said,
[58:46] "Because that's right. Because there's
[58:48] nothing in you to believe."
[58:51] You're not seed.
[58:53] You can't believe if there's no seed.
[58:56] You understand me? It takes God to
[59:00] believe his own word.
[59:03] And as God is already in your soul,
[59:06] the gospel quickens that
[59:10] and that seed comes to life
[59:13] and that seed is God.
[59:17] Cuz let me say it like this. When you
[59:20] meet God,
[59:22] ain't nothing in the world
[59:25] can make you turn on him.
[59:28] You might even backslide,
[59:31] but you still know God is God.
[59:37] Amen. Amen.
[59:39] There's something about the way you were
[59:40] made.
[59:42] Thank God you were made this way.
[59:48] Huh? You think about it. You had all
[59:52] those religious people in the days of
[59:55] Jesus
[59:56] and John the Baptist who was a
[59:58] prophetaptist
[1:00:00] saying look I would look you you look
[1:00:01] like white supplicer that
[1:00:07] means he they done polish your
[1:00:08] tombstones and all of that
[1:00:13] but inwardly you dead men bones.
[1:00:18] He went on and he called them serpents
[1:00:24] and he said, "Now
[1:00:26] to the serpent seed,
[1:00:28] who's going to warn you to flee from the
[1:00:30] wrath to come?
[1:00:34] They didn't have a messenger. They did
[1:00:37] not have a messenger. There was no
[1:00:39] messenger for them. Hallelujah. Jesus
[1:00:43] came seeking his own.
[1:00:46] He understood what he came for
[1:00:49] and he understood those who wouldn't
[1:00:50] believe
[1:00:52] who they were. People of God, if you
[1:00:56] can, I know you do. You got to see what
[1:00:58] I'm saying.
[1:01:00] He made you this way
[1:01:03] and you ought to be so thankful that you
[1:01:06] have to hear
[1:01:09] and a heart to receive.
[1:01:12] Let me let me move on. Now, now if you
[1:01:14] notice,
[1:01:16] after he had made all the creation,
[1:01:19] created a spirit man,
[1:01:22] he said the clothes
[1:01:28] anyway,
[1:01:30] let me say it like this.
[1:01:33] Now he's doing it again.
[1:01:37] He's creating
[1:01:39] man again
[1:01:41] in the earth
[1:01:43] but not out of the earth.
[1:01:48] Your new man.
[1:01:50] Everything is being what? Recreated
[1:01:53] spiritually.
[1:01:58] We know that the dust comes at the end.
[1:02:03] The elements come, the theophony, the
[1:02:05] glorified body. But right now, he's
[1:02:09] creating in you a spirit man,
[1:02:14] a soul man.
[1:02:17] Can I say it like this? He's creating
[1:02:19] himself
[1:02:22] in you.
[1:02:24] You're made that way.
[1:02:28] Glory to God.
[1:02:29] You understand what I'm saying?
[1:02:31] It's not like a donkey and a a horse.
[1:02:38] He's going beyond that.
[1:02:41] He's going to his seed to make sure
[1:02:44] nothing comes hybrid. He goes to his
[1:02:46] seed and he quickens his seed of come on
[1:02:50] somebody
[1:02:52] because it has to be compatible. It has
[1:02:55] to be the same kind.
[1:02:58] Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] He couldn't mate with your flesh.
[1:03:02] He couldn't mate with your spirit,
[1:03:05] but in your soul.
[1:03:09] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:12] Yeah.
[1:03:14] Some people do get excited and some,
[1:03:18] but nevertheless, as long as you said
[1:03:21] amen in your soul,
[1:03:24] because what I'm trying to tell you, you
[1:03:26] may
[1:03:29] you're different.
[1:03:31] You can't say that. Uh, you know, we're
[1:03:34] the same. We're not the same.
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:39] We're even different from the church
[1:03:40] people.
[1:03:42] We're different. We've been made
[1:03:44] different.
[1:03:48] And And you got to understand that you
[1:03:50] you're precious in the eyes of God.
[1:03:52] You're really precious.
[1:03:54] But the devil want to make you think,
[1:03:55] "Oh, you're just the You're not the
[1:03:57] same.
[1:04:00] Even the covenant that God has made with
[1:04:02] you,
[1:04:06] he comes along and gives you what? An
[1:04:08] unconditional covenant.
[1:04:11] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. It's the
[1:04:14] truth. And brother Brandham said, "The
[1:04:16] things that we did, we were drinking
[1:04:20] into it."
[1:04:22] Hallelujah. Glory to God. But the devil
[1:04:26] thought he whooped.
[1:04:29] He defeated God.
[1:04:33] But God went down to hell.
[1:04:36] Reason of the laws. Call it what you
[1:04:37] want.
[1:04:38] And showed the devil who was the boss.
[1:04:43] And the devil never understood
[1:04:46] that there was going to come another
[1:04:47] resurrection.
[1:04:50] Hallelujah.
[1:04:51] Hallelujah.
[1:04:51] Hallelujah.
[1:04:52] But he saw Jesus.
[1:04:55] But he didn't see his offspring.
[1:04:57] Hallelujah. Now he's in a lot of trouble
[1:05:02] because the word said that God will see
[1:05:05] his seed.
[1:05:06] Hallelujah. And on the day of Pentecost,
[1:05:10] guess what? Seed showed up. Hallelujah.
[1:05:15] There was a baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:19] Hallelujah. And those same men
[1:05:24] and some of the others who once cursed
[1:05:27] and did all manner of things.
[1:05:30] Hallelujah. But when that seed
[1:05:33] was quickened, it changed them all
[1:05:36] together.
[1:05:39] And then Peter of all people,
[1:05:42] wrote the statue of a perfect man
[1:05:45] because he knew what he had gone
[1:05:47] through.
[1:05:49] He knew what we had to go through.
[1:05:53] Don't let the devil stop you people.
[1:05:56] Don't let him stop you.
[1:05:59] This this thing that we're getting ready
[1:06:01] to take this translation
[1:06:04] rapture, however you want to call it
[1:06:07] worth every pain, every disappointment
[1:06:13] so that you'll understand.
[1:06:15] Even the prophet God said, "We're going
[1:06:18] to have these trials.
[1:06:20] And these waves are going to come."
[1:06:23] He said, "But we will crest everyone.
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:35] I guess you call this happiness that I
[1:06:36] got joy. I got joy right now.
[1:06:40] Right. Let's move on.
[1:06:42] And creator spirit man.
[1:06:46] The close reading of this now,
[1:06:51] the close reading to this now
[1:06:55] to the one that asked the question
[1:07:00] will find this
[1:07:01] that God gives dominion over the cattle.
[1:07:11] and the fish
[1:07:13] and everything to the man.
[1:07:16] But in his but in his making up there
[1:07:21] he made man in his own image
[1:07:24] to lead the cattle
[1:07:28] to lead the beast of the field
[1:07:35] just like the Holy Spirit leads the
[1:07:37] believer today.
[1:07:41] Oh my goodness. So you understand you
[1:07:45] are made a certain way. You are created
[1:07:49] in a certain way.
[1:07:51] And when you totally if you're filled
[1:07:53] with the Holy Ghost,
[1:07:56] the animals must obey you.
[1:07:58] Hallelujah. All creation must obey you.
[1:08:03] Hallelujah. If it was not so,
[1:08:07] Jesus would not have said,
[1:08:10] "Whatsoever you believe, if you believe
[1:08:13] it,
[1:08:15] if you ask in my name and believe it, it
[1:08:18] shall be given to you."
[1:08:21] Amen.
[1:08:22] Because that revelation is given to you.
[1:08:25] I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God.
[1:08:29] But what happened is when you speak it,
[1:08:33] you better not move
[1:08:37] because
[1:08:39] the devil is going to come and make you
[1:08:42] look like a fool.
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:08:47] Amen. I heard a testimony today
[1:08:51] and this man
[1:08:54] uh guys where where he is. He may hear
[1:08:58] he this old man
[1:09:00] and I think he lives here in in Iowa de
[1:09:03] Mo somewhere.
[1:09:05] I've got a brother right now trying to
[1:09:06] get me in contact with him
[1:09:09] because when he lived in Arkansas
[1:09:12] I got I got I got the testimony on my
[1:09:14] phone.
[1:09:16] He said during during the 50s,
[1:09:19] brother Random went to the funeral home
[1:09:25] and pulled a man, he knew the man out of
[1:09:28] his coffin
[1:09:32] and command him to live.
[1:09:35] He said the people thought he was crazy.
[1:09:38] They ran to cry to grab him
[1:09:41] and they said, "Brother Brandham took
[1:09:43] that man again,
[1:09:45] pinned him up to the wall. They said, "I
[1:09:47] command you to come to life."
[1:09:50] The man fell
[1:09:53] and came back to life.
[1:09:55] Now, this man don't even follow the
[1:09:57] message,
[1:09:59] but he was there when it happened.
[1:10:04] So, I'm trying to make that connection
[1:10:06] with this man.
[1:10:09] And you know what? I believe it.
[1:10:12] I believe there's a lot of people in
[1:10:13] America that have seen the miraculous
[1:10:16] through William Brandham, but they're
[1:10:18] not followers of this message.
[1:10:23] What if
[1:10:25] what if this is the time?
[1:10:29] So I told the Lord, I said, "God, give
[1:10:32] and I told the Lord and I asked the
[1:10:33] Lord, give me means
[1:10:36] If I got to put it on a billboard,
[1:10:40] we need to call everybody here in
[1:10:43] because he preached here.
[1:10:46] Yes, he did.
[1:10:48] And and you know there there was a
[1:10:49] church down there in Wateroo too.
[1:10:52] But there are people here who probably
[1:10:54] are old
[1:10:56] but could give us a real testimony.
[1:11:00] Not only that, they just maybe never
[1:11:03] knew the truth.
[1:11:07] So let's pray people of God that God
[1:11:10] would give us that avenue.
[1:11:16] Well, this brother, you know, y'all know
[1:11:18] um
[1:11:19] Brother Mark
[1:11:21] Dingman. His his mother-in-law was
[1:11:24] Dingman, the one who
[1:11:27] God did some miraculous things.
[1:11:30] So anyway, he contacted I forgot how he
[1:11:32] contacted this man.
[1:11:35] But if you ever want to listen to it, I
[1:11:36] got it on my phone. I can let you listen
[1:11:38] to it.
[1:11:42] God is not the God of yesterday.
[1:11:46] God is the God of yesterday, today, and
[1:11:48] forever.
[1:11:51] He gonna have he he never leave himself
[1:11:53] without a witness.
[1:11:57] He was a young boy when that happened.
[1:11:59] So perhaps he didn't know what came
[1:12:01] afterwards.
[1:12:04] But this brother Mark is working with
[1:12:05] him.
[1:12:07] So praise the Lord for that. See God
[1:12:09] going God ain't going to lose one. Let's
[1:12:11] move on. Let's move on. Let's move on.
[1:12:14] So newspaper, whatever we could do.
[1:12:17] And I need the right wording.
[1:12:20] There's a lot of people that have those
[1:12:23] testimonies
[1:12:26] may not even know that there's a
[1:12:27] movement.
[1:12:31] You love the Lord. Let me move on.
[1:12:33] He was in see paragraph 22.
[1:12:37] He was in other words
[1:12:40] the first man in the lower creation of
[1:12:43] God.
[1:12:45] First creation was God himself.
[1:12:49] Then out of God came the logos
[1:12:53] which was the son of God. Then out of
[1:12:56] the logos
[1:12:57] which was the word and in the beginning
[1:13:00] was the word. And the word was with God.
[1:13:03] And the word was God. And the word was
[1:13:06] made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:13:09] Out of the logos came forth what?
[1:13:15] Amen.
[1:13:17] So out of the logos
[1:13:20] came the man
[1:13:22] and God created the man.
[1:13:26] Spirit first.
[1:13:29] Not like this spirit.
[1:13:32] We're talking about theophony.
[1:13:34] We're talking about a word body.
[1:13:38] We're talking about a man that could
[1:13:40] live, talk,
[1:13:42] yet he didn't have no need to eat,
[1:13:47] but at the same time, he couldn't
[1:13:48] fellowship with the earth.
[1:13:52] And then God formed the dust.
[1:13:58] Y'all hear what I'm saying? The man
[1:14:00] stood there.
[1:14:02] I know a lot of people say he was laying
[1:14:04] down, but I I've never heard brother say
[1:14:05] that.
[1:14:07] He was a tree.
[1:14:09] And God took the dust and formed him
[1:14:13] and then breathe the breath of life.
[1:14:17] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:14:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You love the
[1:14:21] Lord. So what I'm saying because you're
[1:14:23] made in a certain way, take advantage of
[1:14:27] who and what you are.
[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:33] Can I say it like this?
[1:14:35] You are so made like God.
[1:14:38] Out of all of his creation,
[1:14:41] you can have a conference with him.
[1:14:46] You can talk to God and God will talk
[1:14:49] back to you.
[1:14:52] Think about it.
[1:14:54] They they can't do it out there.
[1:14:57] But God has designed us so well.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah. That we can make that
[1:15:04] connection.
[1:15:07] Hallelujah.
[1:15:08] Hallelujah. You got to see the Bible
[1:15:11] said in him dwelt the fullness of the
[1:15:14] godhead body
[1:15:16] and we are complete in him.
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:22] That's the only way we could be
[1:15:24] completed.
[1:15:26] We must be complete in him.
[1:15:29] God in you, the God in me, and we are in
[1:15:33] God, and God is in us.
[1:15:35] Hallelujah. What makes you different?
[1:15:39] I've got high school buddies that's dead
[1:15:40] and gone
[1:15:44] who never knew God.
[1:15:46] Hallelujah. But Jesus said, "My sheep,
[1:15:51] hearth my voice."
[1:15:55] Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:56] Yeah. I'mma tell this.
[1:15:58] When I was a sinner on my birthday,
[1:16:03] January the 31st,
[1:16:05] I was celebrating my birthday in a club.
[1:16:10] I was not a Christian at that time. I
[1:16:13] knew about God.
[1:16:15] I gave my life at 12.
[1:16:17] thought, you know, but I didn't know
[1:16:18] what
[1:16:20] how to divide a Christian. I went
[1:16:23] whirling because there was nobody to
[1:16:25] teach me.
[1:16:27] But that night,
[1:16:29] I got I got alcohol poisoned.
[1:16:35] For y'all that know anything about
[1:16:36] vodka, I drank 13 vodka
[1:16:41] on an empty stomach.
[1:16:46] You tell me God ain't a savior.
[1:16:50] I'm ashamed of that. But you know what?
[1:16:54] I saw death.
[1:16:56] There was such a darkness that came
[1:16:57] through
[1:16:59] and I said, "Oh, God." My mom was
[1:17:01] religious, you know. So I knew if I died
[1:17:04] like that, I was in bad sh. I said, "Oh
[1:17:07] Lord,
[1:17:09] I'm saying this in the club now. I'm
[1:17:11] repenting." And I'm saying, "Oh Lord,
[1:17:14] don't let me die like this. If you get
[1:17:18] me out of here, I promise you I'll be a
[1:17:21] Christian."
[1:17:23] Next Sunday,
[1:17:27] I gave my heart to the Lord.
[1:17:31] I kept my promise.
[1:17:34] I kept my Maybe y'all haven't had an
[1:17:35] experience with death, but I've seen
[1:17:38] death before. Now, if I didn't see him,
[1:17:40] it was somebody that looked like him.
[1:17:42] All I can say is
[1:17:45] that figure came into my room one time.
[1:17:48] I was
[1:17:50] sitting on my bed.
[1:17:53] My aunt and my sister had died passed.
[1:17:56] And I guess he thought he was coming to
[1:17:58] pick me up, too.
[1:18:01] That demon, that dark, there's no way to
[1:18:03] describe the darkness. He came through
[1:18:05] that wall.
[1:18:08] And I'm sitting there and I said,
[1:18:12] "I'm not afraid of you. I'm God gave me
[1:18:16] the words. That's all I can say. I'm not
[1:18:19] afraid of you. And it is not my time. So
[1:18:22] you might as well go back where you came
[1:18:24] from.
[1:18:27] Do you know that thing left me left my
[1:18:30] room
[1:18:33] and went to my sister's sister-in-law?
[1:18:38] who loved me.
[1:18:40] And I was trying to bring this message
[1:18:42] to her.
[1:18:44] Hallelujah. She never rejected a minute
[1:18:46] of it.
[1:18:48] And she was sitting on the bed with her
[1:18:49] husband
[1:18:51] and she fell dead.
[1:18:55] Those things are real people.
[1:18:57] But how come I was able to be? You see
[1:19:00] what I'm saying?
[1:19:02] You don't know how many times God has
[1:19:06] protected you from death.
[1:19:09] Only because he's got a work for you.
[1:19:14] He just not He just not See, I don't
[1:19:16] believe it. I don't believe message
[1:19:19] people.
[1:19:21] I don't believe we're here to form
[1:19:23] another little church or little click.
[1:19:27] No, no. We've got something to do
[1:19:30] and we need to find God. We need to seek
[1:19:32] the Lord and find out what it is he
[1:19:35] wants us to do here in De Mo or wherever
[1:19:39] else.
[1:19:42] I believe that.
[1:19:44] I've gone through too many churches
[1:19:47] and I've seen people and how they do.
[1:19:50] But my point is I believe this message
[1:19:52] with all my heart.
[1:19:54] When I hear brother Bradley say stuff
[1:19:56] like this,
[1:19:57] we are an unvinc invincible army.
[1:20:01] We're omnipotent cuz he is all these
[1:20:05] great things that we and I think to
[1:20:08] myself, when are we going to accept it?
[1:20:10] At what point will we receive this
[1:20:13] message? Hearing it with our ears is one
[1:20:16] thing.
[1:20:17] Receiving it in the heart is another
[1:20:19] thing. God, help us receive this
[1:20:23] message. in our heart.
[1:20:26] So if God chooses to do something, we
[1:20:30] would be available.
[1:20:32] We can't make it happen. But I want to
[1:20:35] be in a place that if he wants something
[1:20:37] to happen, I'll be there to be used and
[1:20:40] you'll be there to be used.
[1:20:43] That's what I'm talking about.
[1:20:45] This is where I'm trying to we got to go
[1:20:48] beyond this universe and understand that
[1:20:51] our power goes beyond this.
[1:20:54] Hallelujah. You said, "Well, brother
[1:20:55] Brooks, I don't know about that."
[1:20:58] Brother Bham said,
[1:21:00] "When Samuel died,
[1:21:02] he still was a prophet.
[1:21:06] When Moses died,
[1:21:08] he still was a prophet."
[1:21:11] Hallelujah.
[1:21:12] Hallelujah.
[1:21:12] Brother Bham's wife, when she died,
[1:21:15] she came back and said, "Bill,
[1:21:18] y'all understand me?" Brother Von said,
[1:21:20] "Well, he thought
[1:21:22] heaven was like we would be on a cloud
[1:21:26] playing the harp."
[1:21:29] He said, "But no, it's a real place.
[1:21:32] It's a real place." He said, "We'll be
[1:21:34] doing things there. We'll be working
[1:21:37] there. We'll be doing things there."
[1:21:40] You got to know this. So, all we see
[1:21:44] over there, and that's that's why the
[1:21:46] word of God talks about it.
[1:21:49] If we're here, we're there. And as he
[1:21:52] is,
[1:21:54] so are we in this world today.
[1:21:58] And God does not change.
[1:22:02] He doesn't change.
[1:22:05] I can't hardly stand it. Sometimes I'm
[1:22:06] at home.
[1:22:09] You know, the devil tried to take my
[1:22:10] mind.
[1:22:12] I said, because God, I know it's real.
[1:22:14] I know I can I can feel it.
[1:22:18] Hallelujah.
[1:22:19] I know it's there,
[1:22:23] but how to get there, Lord?
[1:22:25] You got to take me.
[1:22:27] I need you to push the button,
[1:22:30] but I know I can't get there on my own,
[1:22:34] but I believe I'm there, if that makes
[1:22:36] sense.
[1:22:38] One more. Let's go to St. John 10.
[1:22:42] God me going a different way. my sheep
[1:22:45] or my offspring hearth my voice and a
[1:22:50] stranger that they will not follow.
[1:22:53] People don't let this world get you to a
[1:22:55] place where you become spiritually dull.
[1:23:13] You you you you you've ever How many of
[1:23:16] y'all have ever tried to learn a song
[1:23:20] off of off a record or something and you
[1:23:22] can hear it
[1:23:25] and you cut that that thing off or you
[1:23:26] stop, you can't even remember what words
[1:23:28] would be.
[1:23:31] It's because your mind your mind is
[1:23:33] cloudy.
[1:23:35] You got too many other things. You got
[1:23:36] to you got you got to you got to l
[1:23:39] literally empty your mind and
[1:23:41] concentrate
[1:23:43] on the words
[1:23:45] and the and the notes
[1:23:48] and and you you can't just do it one
[1:23:50] time. Oh, I got it. You got to repeat
[1:23:53] repeat.
[1:23:56] So is it with the word.
[1:24:00] And then when you once once you get into
[1:24:02] the groove of the song, Forgive me for
[1:24:05] that. Or the mood of the song,
[1:24:09] then you can sing it and sing it like
[1:24:12] what the way you feel
[1:24:15] because every song witness to you.
[1:24:20] And that's how the word is. The word
[1:24:23] witness back to you.
[1:24:27] You ever hear people say, "Oh," and I
[1:24:28] know this is this is rattling off a
[1:24:29] little bit. People say, "Oh, that's my
[1:24:32] song.
[1:24:34] But they didn't write it.
[1:24:37] But it means that much to them that
[1:24:40] every time they hear it,
[1:24:43] they get something from it. They can
[1:24:46] identify. Let's move on. John 10:27-30.
[1:24:51] He said, "My sheep hearth my voice
[1:24:54] and I know them
[1:24:59] and they follow me.
[1:25:01] I know them.
[1:25:03] See, we're not of the group when he
[1:25:04] says, "Depart from me. I I know you
[1:25:07] not."
[1:25:09] He said, "I know them,
[1:25:13] and I give unto them eternal life.
[1:25:18] You don't work it, I give it to you.
[1:25:21] You don't earn it, I give it to you.
[1:25:25] And they shall what? Never perish."
[1:25:28] Hallelujah. Neither shall any man knock
[1:25:33] them out of my hand.
[1:25:36] Somebody help me here. My father which
[1:25:38] gave them to me
[1:25:41] is greater than all and no man is able
[1:25:46] to pluck them out of my father's hand.
[1:25:50] I and my father are what?
[1:25:55] Hallelujah.
[1:25:56] Hallelujah. Now, put yourself in the
[1:25:58] equation.
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:02] Know who you are.
[1:26:04] If you got to repeat these words over
[1:26:07] and over and over and over until you
[1:26:10] become a real believer,
[1:26:13] something happens in the soul.
[1:26:16] This is what you is that the word.
[1:26:18] That's why God told Israel, don't forget
[1:26:21] the word. Put it on your forehead. Put
[1:26:24] it around your wrist. Put it on your
[1:26:26] legs, your thigh, everywhere. Put the
[1:26:29] word. This is what we must learn how to
[1:26:32] do.
[1:26:34] Read it. Say it. Listen.
[1:26:38] Even if you don't mind, don't want to do
[1:26:40] it. Do it anyway.
[1:26:44] Hallelujah.
[1:26:46] Hallelujah.
[1:26:47] Hallelujah.
[1:26:47] St. John 12.
[1:26:49] Let's read up a little bit. St. John 12
[1:26:53] 27-30.
[1:26:55] Hallelujah. Why are you worried when he
[1:26:57] said no man can pluck you out?
[1:27:01] Well, you say the devil is a spirit.
[1:27:04] The devil is a man.
[1:27:06] The book of Revelation said,
[1:27:08] "Is this the man?"
[1:27:11] I think it's Revelation, Ezekiel,
[1:27:13] whatever it is. He's he's brought down
[1:27:17] to a man
[1:27:19] that deceive all the nations. Is this
[1:27:22] the man
[1:27:26] Amen.
[1:27:28] Now, is my soul troubled?
[1:27:31] And what shall I say?
[1:27:33] Father, save me from this hour.
[1:27:37] You know, that sounds so familiar,
[1:27:38] doesn't it?
[1:27:41] Save me, Lord.
[1:27:44] We all have those moments. We want to be
[1:27:48] saved from this trouble. Saved from
[1:27:51] distress.
[1:27:52] Say,
[1:27:55] y'all understand me?
[1:27:57] Amen.
[1:27:58] But he said, "Father, save me from this
[1:28:00] hour.
[1:28:01] But for this cause came I unto this
[1:28:06] hour.
[1:28:09] You've been made. He made you this way.
[1:28:13] He could not have put you in any other
[1:28:15] age
[1:28:17] of this age."
[1:28:19] Hallelujah. And guess what?
[1:28:23] God have confidence in you.
[1:28:26] Because he knows what you possess.
[1:28:30] It's in you. You say, "Well, how,
[1:28:32] brother? How?
[1:28:34] It was in Job
[1:28:36] and it's in you.
[1:28:38] That's in the Old Testament. What about
[1:28:41] the new one?"
[1:28:43] Hallelujah.
[1:28:44] Hallelujah.
[1:28:44] Father,
[1:28:46] glorify thy name.
[1:28:47] Glorify. Then came there a voice from
[1:28:50] heaven
[1:28:51] saying, "I have both glorified it
[1:28:56] and will glorify it again."
[1:29:00] Hallelujah.
[1:29:00] Hallelujah.
[1:29:01] The people therefore
[1:29:03] stood by and heard it said that it
[1:29:06] thundered.
[1:29:08] [Laughter]
[1:29:10] Others said, "Angel spake to him."
[1:29:14] And Jesus answered and said, "This voice
[1:29:17] came not because of me,
[1:29:20] but for your sake."
[1:29:24] Oh my God, there's a lot in there, but I
[1:29:26] just don't have time to I don't have
[1:29:27] time.
[1:29:28] But there's a lot in here.
[1:29:32] What God has done in this age,
[1:29:35] there's a lot in here.
[1:29:39] Hallelujah. Oh my god. It amazes me. 1
[1:29:43] Corinthians 2.
[1:29:47] I'm going close down in a bit.
[1:29:50] He made you this way. Be
[1:29:52] I don't know whether the word should be
[1:29:53] proud or
[1:29:55] joyous. He has
[1:29:58] that no matter what you go through, God
[1:30:00] has you.
[1:30:03] He's got you. He's got you. Don't let
[1:30:07] the devil make you fear hell.
[1:30:12] What you going to fear him for?
[1:30:15] Like I heard brother Dig say, he don't
[1:30:17] even have keys to his own house.
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:21] God done took all.
[1:30:25] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:26] First Corinthians 2 beginning at the
[1:30:29] first verse. And brethren, when I came
[1:30:32] to you, I came not with excellence of
[1:30:35] speech or words.
[1:30:39] Declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[1:30:43] See, that that that's that's that that's
[1:30:45] what bothers me. And and and people of
[1:30:48] God, I'm I'm I'm going to say like this.
[1:30:50] I'm still not where I want to be,
[1:30:53] but I want to see the power and
[1:30:55] demonstration
[1:30:56] of the Holy Ghost in this place.
[1:31:02] One man can't bring a revival,
[1:31:06] but we all together can.
[1:31:09] If we really cry out for
[1:31:12] God, you know, we owe it to our young
[1:31:14] kids.
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:20] Children need to know what the Holy
[1:31:22] Ghost is.
[1:31:25] It's not right. We could sit back and
[1:31:27] think no
[1:31:30] when the blood was applied
[1:31:34] all the children and everybody was under
[1:31:37] that blood. It is our business. It's our
[1:31:41] job to get these children under the
[1:31:44] blood.
[1:31:46] We can't just allow them to run and
[1:31:48] carry on. Their lives don't matter. They
[1:31:52] do. It does matter.
[1:31:56] Amen.
[1:31:58] Hallelujah. Even Jesus said so the
[1:32:00] children to come unto me for such
[1:32:06] good speaking and good preaching is
[1:32:07] good. I love it. Paul said that wasn't
[1:32:10] his his main menu,
[1:32:12] his aim. You know, he said, "For I was
[1:32:15] determined, not to know anything among
[1:32:18] you,
[1:32:20] save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[1:32:26] And I was with you in weakness
[1:32:30] and in fear
[1:32:32] and in much trembling.
[1:32:34] Paul said, "I had all the natural things
[1:32:37] working with me.
[1:32:39] Amen.
[1:32:40] Not only was he an apostle, but he was a
[1:32:42] prophet.
[1:32:43] He said, "Listen, in all that I went
[1:32:45] through, yes,
[1:32:46] there were times of weakness. There were
[1:32:49] times of fear. And there were times I
[1:32:51] trembled out of fear."
[1:32:53] Hallelujah.
[1:32:54] Hallelujah. and my speech and my
[1:32:57] preaching was not with enticing words or
[1:33:00] man wisdom
[1:33:03] in the demonstration of the spirit
[1:33:06] and of power. That's where it is.
[1:33:13] But all of us got to be more
[1:33:15] consecrated.
[1:33:19] Hallelujah. Yes. Help us Lord
[1:33:21] that your faith
[1:33:23] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:33:27] but in the power of God.
[1:33:31] Now you think about this old man who saw
[1:33:34] the prophet of God pray for a man and
[1:33:37] the man was resurrected.
[1:33:41] This is not even on record.
[1:33:46] How many more things that are not?
[1:33:49] There were so many things done by Jesus
[1:33:50] that's not even correct.
[1:33:54] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:33:56] I don't know what it's going to take.
[1:34:00] But I do believe we're not far from the
[1:34:02] change.
[1:34:05] And God going to change us all.
[1:34:09] Yes, he will. He promised he will. It
[1:34:11] ain't. He said it won't be because we're
[1:34:13] living right either.
[1:34:16] That's in your seal. Hallelujah.
[1:34:18] That's in your seable book. It's not
[1:34:20] because you're doing everything right.
[1:34:22] It's going to be his mercy and his
[1:34:24] grace.
[1:34:28] Hallelujah.
[1:34:29] Hallelujah.
[1:34:30] You love the Lord. One more scripture.
[1:34:31] St. John 12.
[1:34:33] Jean.
[1:34:37] Oh, I was just reading that, right?
[1:34:39] Yeah, you read that.
[1:34:40] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:34:43] Oh, I didn't finish that right. So,
[1:34:45] Father, glorify thy name.
[1:34:48] Then came there a voice from heaven
[1:34:50] saying,
[1:34:51] I have both glorified it
[1:34:54] and will glorify it again.
[1:34:57] The people therefore stood that stood by
[1:35:00] and heard it and said it thunder and
[1:35:03] others said, "An angel spake to him."
[1:35:06] And Jesus answered and said, "This voice
[1:35:10] came not because of me,
[1:35:12] but for your sake." One more. I got
[1:35:15] three more scriptures. Can I do that?
[1:35:18] I'll try not to be much longer.
[1:35:20] Ephesians 1.
[1:35:24] Just finish it off.
[1:35:26] This is amazing.
[1:35:29] Blessed be the God. The third verse.
[1:35:33] Blessed be the God and father of our
[1:35:35] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:37] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[1:35:39] blessings
[1:35:41] in heavenly places in Christ
[1:35:44] according as he has chosen us
[1:35:48] in him
[1:35:49] before the foundation of the world that
[1:35:52] we should be holy and without blame
[1:35:56] before him in love.
[1:35:58] Now his love is so powerful
[1:36:02] He won't allow us to be blamed.
[1:36:06] He takes all the blame at Calvary. He
[1:36:08] took it all.
[1:36:10] So there's no blame.
[1:36:12] Hallelujah. Having predestinated us
[1:36:16] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:36:19] Christ to himself
[1:36:22] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:36:24] will.
[1:36:26] And whether you realize it or not, in
[1:36:28] all your trials and troubles, God is
[1:36:31] having good pleasure.
[1:36:36] He is defeating
[1:36:38] the devil in your life every day.
[1:36:42] And you ought to thank God for the good
[1:36:45] times and the bad times. All right. I
[1:36:47] just I got just two more scriptures and
[1:36:49] then we'll let you go. We know some of
[1:36:51] you all we understand your position.
[1:36:53] Isaiah 40:18.
[1:37:01] Let's just jump to Isaiah 46. I'll skip
[1:37:04] that one
[1:37:06] because this one says, "To whom who to
[1:37:09] whom then will ye liken God?"
[1:37:14] "Or what likeness will you compare him
[1:37:16] unto?"
[1:37:18] There is none.
[1:37:20] Isaiah 46
[1:37:22] through 5
[1:37:25] I think
[1:37:25] and then we'll go to Proverbs 3 and I'm
[1:37:27] done. Proverbs
[1:37:30] with this. Yeah.
[1:37:33] Isaiah 46 3-5.
[1:37:36] Harken unto me, oh house of is of Jacob
[1:37:39] and all the remnant of the house of
[1:37:41] Israel
[1:37:43] which are born by me.
[1:37:47] Born by who? Me.
[1:37:49] From the belly which are carried from
[1:37:51] the womb.
[1:37:53] Hallelujah. Oh Lord have mercy. That's
[1:37:55] deep. That's deep people.
[1:37:56] And even to you, listen, this is what I
[1:37:59] love when I read the scripture. And even
[1:38:01] to your old age,
[1:38:04] I am he. And even to hair
[1:38:10] will I carry you. I have made you. I
[1:38:14] will bear.
[1:38:16] Even I will carry and will deliver you.
[1:38:21] To whom will you liken me?
[1:38:24] And make me equal
[1:38:26] and compare me
[1:38:28] that we may be like.
[1:38:32] Did you hear what he said?
[1:38:34] That we may be like,
[1:38:40] he kept saying me, me, but at the end he
[1:38:43] said that we may be like.
[1:38:49] Just think about it.
[1:38:52] Proverbs three,
[1:38:54] I'm I'm ending on this one. Thank you.
[1:38:58] So, I want you to understand,
[1:39:01] he said, "Now comparing me, who going to
[1:39:02] be like me?" But look what he says about
[1:39:06] her.
[1:39:08] Proverbs 3:15,
[1:39:10] "She is more precious than rubies.
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:15] And all the things thou can't desire are
[1:39:17] not to be compared
[1:39:22] unto her.
[1:39:25] You're more valuable than you think,
[1:39:28] more valuable than you know.
[1:39:31] Nothing can compare to you
[1:39:34] because of the way he made you.
[1:39:39] I'm excited
[1:39:42] because I want you to understand this.
[1:39:44] This is like vitamins.
[1:39:50] You know, have you ever been really
[1:39:51] tired and you need some coffee
[1:39:56] wakes you up
[1:39:59] to another dimension? You see
[1:40:02] in another realm, in another dimension,
[1:40:07] it shuts down this thing. down shoes.
[1:40:12] Let's dance.
[1:40:22] Let's sing that old song.
[1:40:25] Amazing grace.
[1:40:30] Amazing
[1:40:34] grace.
[1:40:36] How sweet
[1:40:39] the sound
[1:40:42] that say
[1:40:46] a wretch
[1:40:49] like me.
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:55] I once
[1:40:58] was lost
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:01] but now
[1:41:04] I found. Hallelujah. Was blind
[1:41:11] but now
[1:41:14] I see.
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:20] was grace
[1:41:23] that taught
[1:41:26] my heart
[1:41:29] to fear. Hallelujah.
[1:41:33] And grace
[1:41:35] my fears. Hallelujah.
[1:41:39] Relieve.
[1:41:43] Oh,
[1:41:45] how precious
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:51] that grace
[1:41:54] appear.
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:42:00] I first

[1:42:09] through many
[1:42:13] danger

[1:42:43] us far

[1:42:52] me home.

[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:10] Oh, bright shine
[1:43:13] in us.
[1:43:17] [Music]
[1:43:31] God's grace
[1:43:34] that when
[1:43:37] we first
[1:43:40] be
[1:43:45] amen
[1:43:49] we're going to pray for brother Josh
[1:43:50] Breezy
[1:43:52] uh I know you we I haven't seen him in a
[1:43:55] while. I've been talking to him
[1:43:59] and uh he's u he's really backsliding.
[1:44:06] Uh just to explain his condition.
[1:44:11] He he suffered from PTSD
[1:44:16] and on his birthday he
[1:44:20] he got excited
[1:44:22] and he ended up u fighting his uh cousin
[1:44:26] or uncle one.
[1:44:31] Anyway, they called the police on him.
[1:44:34] I'm sure he's an open man. He wouldn't
[1:44:36] mind me saying these things,
[1:44:40] but you heard his testimony how he was
[1:44:43] delivered from drugs.
[1:44:46] Well, the only way that he can stay out
[1:44:49] of jail.
[1:44:51] In other words, they forced those drugs
[1:44:53] back on him.
[1:44:56] And he has been struggling ever since.
[1:45:03] Because he had gone years without
[1:45:06] those drugs.
[1:45:08] So we need to pray for him.
[1:45:11] He said, "Brother Brooks," he said,
[1:45:14] "Maybe you need to take me from under
[1:45:16] the blood."
[1:45:18] I said, "Brother, why why would I want
[1:45:20] to do such a thing when I know in your
[1:45:23] heart you love the Lord?"
[1:45:26] I said, "Satan pull a trick on you."
[1:45:29] and um you know
[1:45:33] I believe you're God's son.
[1:45:37] So let's pray for him that God will
[1:45:39] deliver him.
[1:45:41] See he was praising God too much
[1:45:44] everywhere he was going. He was
[1:45:45] witnessing this message. And the devil
[1:45:48] didn't like it. The devil didn't like
[1:45:51] and uh there's a lot of more things I
[1:45:53] could say but
[1:45:55] Satan hates that guy.
[1:45:59] So, let's pray for him.
[1:46:00] And I want you to put yourself in that
[1:46:02] position
[1:46:04] because it could easily be you,
[1:46:07] but he's one of ours.
[1:46:09] And God has placed it on my wife heart.
[1:46:13] Pray for him.
[1:46:15] I love brother Josh. There's nothing he
[1:46:18] could do that may that would change my
[1:46:20] heart and mind about him. So, let's pray
[1:46:23] for him now. Father God, we come before
[1:46:26] you, Lord, in your presence, dear Jesus.
[1:46:30] We pray for our precious brother Josh.
[1:46:32] Hallelujah.
[1:46:33] Lord, I know that in his heart he would
[1:46:35] love to be there. But Satan has trapped
[1:46:38] him in in captivity again, but you
[1:46:42] delivered him once and I know you can
[1:46:44] deliver him again. Lord, as we pray for
[1:46:47] Josh, hallelujah, we pray that at this
[1:46:50] moment, that creation will begin to cast
[1:46:54] out every dark spirit in him, Lord.
[1:46:57] Everything that he's taken on since he's
[1:46:59] fallen out of shame, Lord, I know that's
[1:47:02] what it is, Lord. He's hurting. He's
[1:47:04] embarrassed. But, Father, we see what
[1:47:07] Satan did. Have mercy upon him, Lord,
[1:47:09] and deliver my father.
[1:47:11] May your mercy and your grace be with
[1:47:13] him once more, Lord. Grant him victory
[1:47:16] in the name of Jesus. Give him a heart
[1:47:18] and a mind and a determination to
[1:47:20] overcome this these devils once again.
[1:47:24] Bless him now. Bless him now and deliver
[1:47:27] him from this situation that he
[1:47:30] father we'll be careful to give you the
[1:47:31] praise, glory and honor. Lord, we don't
[1:47:35] believe in leaving not one behind. Lord,
[1:47:38] even as Moses said, we won't leave one
[1:47:40] hoof behind. And he is our brother,
[1:47:42] Lord. I know he is Lord and I pray for
[1:47:45] him now. Hallelujah.
[1:47:48] Heal his mind, body, soul and spirit in
[1:47:51] the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[1:47:55] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:56] Amen. Amen.
