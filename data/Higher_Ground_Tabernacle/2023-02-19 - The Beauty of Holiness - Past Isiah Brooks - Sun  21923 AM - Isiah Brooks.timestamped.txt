[2:43] Faith takes the Eternal rest
[2:49] and upon God's words
[2:54] now we believe the Bible to be God's
[2:57] infallible word
[3:01] that it is the entire revelation of
[3:04] Jesus Christ
[3:07] revealing himself in the Old Testament
[3:11] by the prophets god making himself known
[3:17] Christ Jesus Christ and in him well the
[3:21] fullness of the godhead bodily foreign

[7:27] whatever that's of this nature here
[7:35] y'all hear what I'm saying

[7:42] he wants to achieve something he puts
[7:45] his whole heart into it
[7:47] right brother

[7:52] successful
[7:55] heart into what he's doing sit down

[8:32] tell y'all something
[8:34] this is your season of Revival
[8:40] believe it or not
[8:42] and if it's not it's easy to give an
[8:45] account for to what God for telling you
[8:47] that because
[8:51] take advantage of this season
[8:54] find yourself
[9:01] amen
[9:02] amen
[9:04] nothing yeah it's going to stop a man
[9:09] when he is perseverance
[9:12] when he knows what he is doing
[9:15] and God's faith is what he's trying to
[9:18] achieve
[9:20] nothing will stop him is that right
[9:24] listen God Called Moses and God gave
[9:28] Moses nothing but his word
[9:34] how ridiculous the scene is
[9:58] everybody could have looked at him as he
[10:01] was crazy
[10:05] laughed his face
[10:19] and Moses stayed with the commission
[10:23] look at this world now
[10:26] refuse that little Kentucky called
[10:28] William Brothers
[11:19] know it that thing is shut down
[11:22] to get any better better
[11:26] you will become the enemy
[11:29] they trying to get rid of Christians
[11:47] Soldier
[12:03] oh yeah don't be so proud to refuse to
[12:08] call him Hallelujah
[12:14] Moses conquered Egypt with a stick in
[12:18] his hands
[12:19] think about the odds against that
[12:24] and you said there
[12:27] and you can't even conquer one demon
[12:29] remember
[12:31] a demon that had been tormenting you
[12:34] perhaps all your life
[12:40] because the greatest heaters in you
[12:44] that is in the world
[12:47] he's talking about the Holy House the
[12:50] creator of all things
[12:53] Hallelujah listen let me tell you
[12:55] something
[12:57] the disciples were on the disease
[13:02] and the storm came and Jesus was in the
[13:06] bottom of the city the competitive news
[14:08] God cares for you
[14:13] foreign
[14:16] [Applause]
[14:21] defeated Goliath I've even created with
[14:24] a slingshot
[14:26] no one stone you know he always puts us
[14:29] to the position where it looks like the
[14:32] odds are against us hallelujah
[14:37] that's what he did to the disciples but
[14:40] what did Jesus do because
[14:42] God stood up on the realm of that boat
[14:44] does he still living on the back you
[14:46] commanded this the ocean and the Sea and
[14:49] the waves and he said
[14:51] be still
[14:53] um
[14:58] had to let go y'all hear what I'm saying
[15:01] but what the difference was it was so
[15:05] connected the man Christ Jesus
[15:16] that's where God wants us to be it's
[15:19] good
[15:20] and we're his brethrens
[15:26] and God wants us
[15:32] to calm the storms Hallelujah
[15:40] Noah in a scientific age
[15:44] conquered the scientific age in which he
[15:46] lived Hallelujah
[15:50] Hallelujah will you be able to conquer
[15:53] it is it this kind of religion anymore
[16:17] Hallelujah I'm not saying God don't use
[16:20] them
[16:21] foreign
[17:31] prostituting
[17:42] the so-called Church of God I can't help
[17:45] it
[17:46] Hallelujah but we're trying to be pure
[17:51] we want to be righteous but our Holiness
[17:54] must come from him
[18:05] another man very perseverance
[18:08] he was born a Nazarite and the Nazarite
[18:12] means separated to the word
[18:15] what a nice thing it would be tonight
[18:18] if all boys
[18:32] listen he had Seven Locks that's it okay
[18:35] sir that hung down his back
[18:39] which was a sign that he was separated
[18:44] God said number Seven Locks was the type
[18:48] of the anointed
[18:50] Hallelujah is that all right faith is an
[18:54] anointing
[18:55] amen virtuous
[19:02] Hallelujah
[19:11] [Applause]
[19:12] [Music]
[19:36] as he looked it up only let your
[19:38] conversation be as it becoming the
[19:40] gospel of Christ
[19:42] you know what the word conversation
[19:44] means let your life
[19:47] the way you speak the way you talk about
[19:50] it
[19:52] Hallelujah as it becometh the gospel of
[19:55] who Christ
[20:07] I may hear of your Affairs
[20:10] that you stand fast in one spirit
[20:18] for the faith of the Gospel
[20:22] Hallelujah now you must understand
[20:25] one Faith one Spirit that's the only way
[20:29] this assembly
[20:34] of us receive the holy foreign
[21:44] that was just the beginning
[21:48] yeah
[21:50] that was the beginning nobody taught me
[21:53] I had to mature
[21:56] nobody told me that that was just the
[22:00] beginning they made me think that was
[22:03] the ultimate
[22:05] that's why people fall apart
[22:09] and if you don't teach them correctly
[22:11] they won't grow in the world
[22:14] away
[22:22] that's where the straight comes
[22:27] in the right way and you know you have a
[22:31] goal to achieve
[22:33] but what we've done just like all the
[22:37] other churches
[22:38] while we're busy
[22:41] fighting with doctrines
[22:48] can I say it like this she ain't got
[22:51] time
[22:54] to fight the Sabbath
[22:57] the ways of bolstering on both sides
[23:01] those doctrines
[23:05] focus on Jesus
[23:14] [Applause]
[23:17] amen the word becomes her mirror
[23:20] Hallelujah like I was saying at that
[23:23] funeral come true
[23:29] I'm not looking for Peter Paul or John
[23:32] I'm looking for me
[23:37] don't
[24:19] unless you make unless you fail a
[24:22] wonderful monkey to make the turn dude
[24:27] how many of y'all ever been there you're
[24:30] driving so fast you don't even see the
[24:31] bed
[24:33] and you know if you don't make that turn
[24:35] that caught scared like this here you
[24:37] know right and you realize if you had
[24:40] not turned you would have wrecked into
[24:42] something
[24:44] and I Prophet God kept telling us
[24:50] it's not a straight line
[24:57] it doesn't down what he has done
[25:02] it doesn't minimize what he's done
[25:06] because the word of God for this hour
[25:10] I don't know about you we need it
[25:16] let's move on
[25:18] let this mind be in you the secret is
[25:21] which was also in Christ Jesus
[25:24] speak in the form of God the characters
[25:35] you act like you can't comprehend what
[25:38] I'm saying
[25:41] God here this morning this is a serious
[25:44] message and if you fail to get it don't
[25:47] blame it
[25:48] y'all better hear what I'm saying don't
[25:51] blame me this is your day of Revival
[25:54] of getting it right don't do this
[26:01] is
[26:03] cleaning up time Hallelujah you can't
[26:07] make a Rapture
[26:10] because the Bible says no unclean things
[26:16] and that means you gotta Hallelujah
[26:27] [Applause]
[26:52] for he was God word made flesh Saint
[26:57] John in the beginning was the word
[26:59] first Saint John 1 Central in the
[27:02] beginning was the word
[27:05] and the Word was God and the Word was
[27:08] made flesh and dwelt Among Us the same
[27:11] yesterday and forever he was there to
[27:15] reveal the promises of God
[27:19] and watch Christ throughout all of the
[27:22] Old Testaments
[27:25] Hallelujah is that right I mean where
[27:28] was Moses
[27:31] God had prophesied Moses would come well
[27:36] Moses was right there and Israel had no
[27:39] idea
[27:40] who he was
[27:42] Hallelujah right there in Egypt on
[27:46] egyptica and they had no idea the only
[27:49] person that knew him was his mama
[27:55] in the media family you know what I'm
[27:56] saying
[27:57] and we find out who didn't know who he
[28:01] was
[28:02] met God on the back side
[28:07] identified to Moses
[28:10] who he was
[28:13] amen y'all hear what I'm saying and
[28:16] that's why every believer
[28:19] on the back side of the desert whatever
[28:22] that means to you Hallelujah that's okay
[28:25] I trust the beauty of Holiness
[28:29] where God dwells in
[28:32] where the power of the Holy Ghost is
[28:37] what people don't understand it's your
[28:40] long dresses
[28:44] Brothers it's not because you dress
[28:46] neatly
[28:49] I mean you got every kind of religion
[28:52] that dress better than we do
[28:54] Holiness is with you
[28:57] I'm gonna say it again
[28:59] Holiness is within
[29:02] and when you get it within it will
[29:05] reflect itself outwards
[29:07] I don't have to teach you certain things
[29:17] you know when Jesus brought true to the
[29:18] Pharisees Pharisees
[29:28] they always get mad at the word
[29:30] [Music]
[29:31] some people think we don't need that yes
[29:40] if you don't
[29:56] [Applause]
[30:07] the devil believes it
[30:11] that's right
[30:14] yeah but that doesn't make him right
[30:23] amen have faith
[30:25] we thank thee for those who have been
[30:28] called out
[30:30] the ones that escape in the day
[30:35] the people of God will be beautiful and
[30:39] we thank thee for the beauty of Holiness
[30:47] holy spirit filled people living for you
[30:52] by the grace that uh they are dead by
[30:57] your grace they they are this you do
[30:58] something let me let me move on I've got
[31:00] I'm almost done
[31:01] yeah
[31:03] because I'm gonna tell you if you don't
[31:04] set a goal
[31:06] an objective
[31:11] I'm gonna close on this if you don't set
[31:14] a goal if you're not hungry and
[31:16] thirsting for righteousness
[31:18] something's wrong
[31:21] you've been distracted
[31:24] and every Christian should have a thirst
[31:26] in them
[31:33] and this this is not a thing that you
[31:35] wake up to on every Sunday morning
[31:39] every Wednesday night you know I don't
[31:42] know I don't know when when there's
[31:45] change in a lot of you guys
[31:48] because I know that your church
[31:50] attendance will change Hallelujah
[31:57] the devil said well you don't have to
[31:59] come to church
[32:03] but what the devil does is this girl
[32:08] come to when you see that day
[32:09] approaching those two voices come
[32:12] together
[32:14] and what y'all do with that is come over
[32:18] to my house for some food
[32:23] we're coming together
[32:28] yeah we're together
[32:31] but that's not what he's talking about
[32:35] that can fall in line with that um
[32:40] [Applause]
[32:47] to give you your daily bread
[32:54] how many of y'all have ever
[32:56] thought about a certain food on Japan
[32:59] that food has been on your mind all day
[33:03] and then you come home
[33:05] and your wife or your mama
[33:08] it's cooking it all kinds of papaya
[33:12] even the young boy back there you know
[33:13] what I'm saying you know
[33:15] [Laughter]
[33:17] is somehow it makes the food taste
[33:19] better
[33:21] let God intervene for you
[33:26] see that's the way it works
[33:34] many times my wife and I have had the
[33:37] same food desire we want to go out we
[33:39] don't mind my family
[33:42] and she'll have fish on her mind and I
[33:45] have fishes
[33:50] no argument we don't have to toss coins
[33:56] I love it I watch things like that
[33:58] because
[34:00] orchestrating things in those little
[34:02] ways
[34:05] listen to this before I let in this
[34:08] message now we're going to have a little
[34:10] praise and worship afterwards
[34:12] whatever somebody got a testimony
[34:19] I I want to say something you know
[34:21] afterwards but I don't want to you know
[34:24] anyway uh don't let me forget that I
[34:26] need to say something
[34:28] but you know there is something about it
[34:33] if God begins to put a hunger in our
[34:36] human heart
[34:38] there is there is just nothing yeah
[34:42] going to stand in its way
[34:45] whether there is cooperation or not
[34:49] or whether there is anything
[34:54] she's got to find that
[35:49] it's going to happen
[35:54] amen
[35:56] you understand that
[35:59] like I said the Holiness of God is
[36:03] being robbed in his righteousness
[36:06] and be enrolled in his righteousness
[36:10] being covered by his blood
[36:12] and being covered by his blood is to be
[36:16] in Christ by the Holy Spirit
[36:18] you love the Lord
[36:22] amen we do have a baptism I'm just going
[36:25] to stop because I know how long-winded I
[36:27] could be
[36:29] uh just just know that the Lord is not
[36:32] slack concerning his promises
[36:37] and don't think because I'm finding a
[36:40] message that is
[36:43] no no they're criterias that must be met
[36:48] and that is you know you got to come
[36:50] from justification the same time
[36:54] and baptism the Holy Ghost will bring
[36:57] you into Christ himself
[37:03] and that's the word of the Scripture
[37:07] it won't it won't mean that you're not
[37:09] saying
[37:10] there'll be many people following this
[37:12] message
[37:16] because they failed to go on they didn't
[37:19] have a goal you know they didn't have
[37:21] nothing to achieve
[37:23] but those of us who who are pushing
[37:27] continuing let me tell you something
[37:29] this moment foreign
[37:40] you can pray sometimes and you can just
[37:43] go you just like travel on the Wind yeah
[37:45] but there are times there's something
[37:48] and you want to pray
[37:51] God I feel like God is nowhere near you
[37:54] if something comes to Judy and that's
[37:56] the time to pray
[37:59] that's he's trying to see whether you
[38:03] mature enough whether you're gonna
[38:05] you're gonna talk to him
[38:08] or you talk to him when you don't feel
[38:10] it Hallelujah
[38:13] talking to God goes beyond your senses
[38:16] you don't have to feel him
[38:19] because he hears you anyway
[38:22] you love the Lord
[38:24] let's just pray

[38:30] lord

[59:39] just uh
[59:41] you know brother Isaiah asked me to
[59:43] listen to a message
[59:45] it's about uh I don't know what it's
[59:46] called I think it was a changing of his
[59:49] my new ministry and uh I was listening
[59:53] to the message and he was talking about
[59:54] sister Hattie Wright I think a lot of
[59:56] people know the story about sister
[59:58] Hattie Wright and uh as a brother
[1:00:02] brother Ryan was talking about that
[1:00:04] story how Mr Hattie Wright asked the
[1:00:07] right thing she asked for the Salvation
[1:00:09] of her two sons and uh I was listening
[1:00:12] to a little bit more and uh brother
[1:00:14] Brown starts talking about this he says
[1:00:17] he's talking about sister Hattie Wright
[1:00:19] she was very very poor as everyone knows
[1:00:22] and one of the things that they him and
[1:00:26] um brother
[1:00:27] the the
[1:00:29] pastor of the church I forget his name
[1:00:31] we're talking about was Sister Hattie
[1:00:34] Wright was wanting to give her ties and
[1:00:37] she had fifty dollars to give her ties
[1:00:39] and the Pastor said no no you you can't
[1:00:42] give that much
[1:00:44] he said so he ended up
[1:00:47] convincing her to give twenty dollars
[1:00:51] and then brother Branham heard that she
[1:00:52] gave twenty dollars I gotta give her
[1:00:54] back but the holy spirit said something
[1:00:56] to him he says don't do it
[1:00:59] and then he said then he tied that of
[1:01:02] her giving twenty dollars in ties
[1:01:04] to receiving
[1:01:07] when she said the right thing said God
[1:01:10] blessed her God won't owe you anything
[1:01:13] he'll never owe you anything amen so
[1:01:16] with that being said Brother Sam asked
