[2:46] Ruth chapter 1 if you have a say man the
[2:52] Bible says now came to pass in the days
[2:54] when the judges ruled that there was a
[2:58] famine in the land and a certain man of
[3:01] Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in a
[3:06] country of Moab he and his wife and his
[3:08] two sons in the name of the man was a
[3:12] limb elect in the name of his wife Naomi
[3:15] in the name of his two sons my lon and
[3:19] Kyle on e4 Knights of Bethlehem Judah
[3:23] and they came into the country of Moab
[3:27] and continued there and Elimelech
[3:30] Naomi's husband died and she was left
[3:33] and her two sons and they took them
[3:36] wives of the women of Moab the name of
[3:40] one was offer and the name of the other
[3:44] roof and they dwelt there about 10 years
[3:49] and Malin and kai-lan died also both of
[3:53] them and the women was left of her two
[3:56] sons and her husband amen let's go to
[4:00] second chronicles chapter 18 second
[4:09] chronicles chapter 18 we're also gonna
[4:14] start at verse 1
[4:20] the Bible says now Jehoshaphat had
[4:24] riches and honor in abundance enjoying
[4:27] affinity with a hab and after seven at
[4:31] and after certain years he went down to
[4:34] a hab in Samaria and a hab kills sheep
[4:38] and oxen for him in abundance and for
[4:41] the people that he had with him and
[4:45] persuaded him to go up with him to
[4:48] ramoth-gilead and am king of israel said
[4:52] unto joseph at king of judah wilt thou
[4:56] go with me
[4:57] to ramoth-gilead and he answered him I
[5:00] am as thou are and my people as thy
[5:04] people and we will be with thee in the
[5:08] war and Jehoshaphat said unto the king
[5:10] of Israel inquire I pray thee at the
[5:13] word of the Lord today he made me the
[5:17] Lord of the Blessed reading of his word
[5:18] you can have your seats amen you know
[5:24] today I want I want to use for a subject
[5:26] a familiar for me a thought but we just
[5:31] with we're we're we're depending on God
[5:34] to bring this out a man you know and
[5:36] today I want to use for a subject under
[5:40] the influence a man under the influence
[5:44] you know and as we look at it influence
[5:47] is a powerful thing you know sometimes
[5:50] you can be you can be being influenced
[5:53] by something and you realize the effect
[5:56] of it you don't even realize the spirit
[5:59] behind what's influencing you you know
[6:02] and you know that's why they talk about
[6:04] you know sports and idols and all those
[6:07] things because whatever they like will
[6:10] influence your life you know one of the
[6:13] most influential women in the world
[6:16] today is Beyonce you know any kind of
[6:19] soul she come out with any kind of any
[6:21] kind of dress she come out with it
[6:23] influences the generations that are
[6:26] following her you know and she don't
[6:28] have to do much but just step out and
[6:30] show it she'll have to say much
[6:33] to do much but just because of a person
[6:35] she is you know it influences so many
[6:39] different people on so many different
[6:41] levels you know and you take a a man
[6:45] like Michael Jordan who's not even
[6:47] playing basketball anymore but he still
[6:50] has such an influence on the game that
[6:53] mean when they come into the league they
[6:56] go and study his field they're going
[6:59] steady the way he playing and his life
[7:02] has such an influence on the game today
[7:05] and he's not even playing
[7:08] you know church if we could just think
[7:10] about the spirit behind the spirit amen
[7:13] and look at your life right now and ask
[7:17] the question to yourself what's
[7:19] influencing you amen
[7:20] you know but I want to show two kinds of
[7:23] influences I want to show the influence
[7:26] and the Bible of of of the chapter Ruth
[7:30] you know what how how roof and and
[7:34] offering Naomi
[7:36] they all were under the headship of
[7:39] their husbands and then all of a sudden
[7:41] they didn't have time to prepare for
[7:44] death you know and the husband's dying
[7:47] and the influence of the husbands now
[7:50] we're going and it's like what can we do
[7:52] now hallelujah and we looked at Naomi
[7:56] her influence of our daughter-in-laws he
[7:59] told both of them I want you to go back
[8:01] to wherever you come from go back to
[8:03] your mama's house you know offer us she
[8:06] said okay i'ma go but Ruth Ruth saw
[8:09] something in her mother in her
[8:11] mother-in-law she saw something she had
[8:13] such a great influence she wasn't
[8:16] willing to go back where she came from
[8:17] she was willing to go back to the
[8:20] homeland everything that she was knew he
[8:23] had no longer other influence in her
[8:25] life the life that she was living it
[8:28] meant so much more greater to her that
[8:31] she wouldn't listen to the mother-in-law
[8:32] trying to get her to go back where she
[8:34] came from so chuckling we look at
[8:36] influence influence Amen you know when
[8:39] you think about a person that likes to
[8:42] drink and smoke and everything their
[8:44] body's being influenced by certain stuff
[8:47] and you know one thing I realize about a
[8:49] person listen maybe say he's an
[8:51] alcoholic you know when that man get
[8:54] something in his system and he's
[8:55] influenced you know always wonder why
[8:59] they call alcohol and beer spirits do
[9:04] realize that when you go and look at the
[9:07] store they have on it spirits because
[9:11] that alcohol oh yeah that substance it
[9:14] has the ability to make come out of you
[9:18] what you wouldn't already say or what
[9:20] you wouldn't already do it has the
[9:22] ability to take over your body take over
[9:26] your mind take over your actions and you
[9:29] can be under the influence of a
[9:31] substance
[9:32] oh my and you know just when we look at
[9:39] influences today there are so many
[9:42] different influences their influences of
[9:45] music and and influences of hardwood and
[9:48] influences of clothing and all these
[9:51] things but where are these influences
[9:53] coming from honey that's the question we
[9:56] have to ask ourself you ever ask
[9:58] yourself right now what's influencing
[10:01] you a man
[10:02] am I being influenced from a boss oh I'm
[10:05] being influenced from below haruya you
[10:08] know lean brother Brooks was riding back
[10:09] home last night and we got this we got
[10:12] this talking about when we were younger
[10:16] and kind of before we got saving things
[10:19] you know we started talking about horror
[10:21] pictures and in the movies and things
[10:24] like that and both of us agreed that we
[10:27] were never of that group that loves to
[10:30] go and watch horror pictures because
[10:33] they were something in our spirit that
[10:35] realized the influence of killing and
[10:37] murder and all these things it came from
[10:40] the underworld it came from demon powers
[10:43] and for you to give yourself over into
[10:46] that you're contributing to that
[10:48] influence and you refer yourself doing
[10:51] things earlier that comes from the
[10:53] underworld you know it's and it's really
[10:58] plain because
[11:00] where would the influence come from to
[11:02] cut somebody's hand off that wouldn't
[11:05] come from God but people easily give
[11:09] themselves over to these things and they
[11:12] don't even realize the spirit behind and
[11:15] they're watching it and it's born into
[11:16] their system but what they're doing
[11:18] they're feeling an evil spirit
[11:23] hey you know Church it's so easy to do
[11:27] things like that in the Bible you know
[11:30] there was a woman named Herodias you
[11:34] know she married a man and she should've
[11:38] married a man and you know John the
[11:40] Baptist he spoke about that he told them
[11:43] you know y'all shouldn't got married and
[11:45] she hated John because John spoke the
[11:48] truth
[11:48] John was under the influence of God and
[11:52] at that moment when her and her husband
[11:54] honey honey you got married she married
[11:57] her brother's husband she married her
[11:59] husband's brother and John said that
[12:02] ain't right you shouldn't be doing it
[12:04] and because she was under such an
[12:07] influence of getting whatever she wanted
[12:10] she couldn't even see the truth honey
[12:13] you know she got mad at that and the
[12:17] other day the King the one she married
[12:20] he had a celebration honey you know we
[12:23] all like the dance but be careful
[12:26] there's a spirit behind every dance and
[12:28] this particular woman
[12:30] Herodias daughter she got again and she
[12:33] starts shaking it up well she started to
[12:36] bring it down and you know the king he
[12:39] he was very enticed
[12:41] he was liking that dance he was liking
[12:43] the way she was shaking it out he liked
[12:45] it so much - it influenced him to tell
[12:48] her I give you whatever you want in my
[12:50] King just wanna dance that dance was so
[12:56] powerful that King said God you can have
[12:58] whatever I got dancing is powerful it's
[13:06] a spirit but am I in the book talk to
[13:10] the church they were in the book
[13:12] holy and the reason why it's so tight
[13:15] because this morning because we're
[13:17] dealing with spirits honey
[13:19] hey man but you know Church she danced
[13:22] and she danced and the King loved it and
[13:25] all the people around him they loved it
[13:27] again what makes Beyonce so popular the
[13:31] way she moves the way she days you need
[13:37] all about her singing it's about her
[13:39] body her movement the influence of her
[13:42] dress there is a spirit behind
[13:46] hallelujah and you know Church throat
[13:51] his daughter she danced and she danced
[13:53] in the king you know what he said
[13:55] he said hey girl I love the way you move
[13:57] it I love the way you shake it
[14:00] I'm gonna give you heylia whatever you
[14:03] extra and she said okay I want the hand
[14:06] of John the Baptist so what kind of
[14:09] spirit was behind that dance it was a
[14:11] spirit of Mara it was a spirit of death
[14:14] he was a spirit of death behind that
[14:17] dance even though that King liked it so
[14:22] we have to be careful what's influencing
[14:24] us honey cuz you can look at something
[14:27] and he can look pleasurable if you look
[14:29] innocent but it'll be an evil spirit
[14:32] behind hallelujah
[14:34] you can say hey I want to do this I want
[14:36] to do that but you have to be careful
[14:38] hurry and watch the spirit behind the
[14:41] things we like you know and some people
[14:44] they still like drink a little casual
[14:46] drink drink a little bit of wine take a
[14:49] little bit of juice hallelujah and they
[14:52] don't realize honey there's a spirit
[14:55] behind
[14:56] you've been casually that's what Satan
[14:59] wants us to be he wants us to be casual
[15:04] because you know what you do with these
[15:06] casual you don't see no harm in it
[15:09] that's why they call it a little white
[15:11] lie ain't no lie white oh my but you
[15:18] know treasure look they beginning to
[15:20] look at Ruth Ruth saw something that her
[15:24] sister-in-law couldn't see
[15:26] and she said you know what wherever you
[15:29] go I'm going whenever you do I'm doing
[15:32] the guy you service my god honey
[15:35] whenever you like I'm Allah whatever you
[15:38] need imma eat she saw greater influence
[15:41] in Naomi's life earlier not only Naomi
[15:44] but in Naomi's relationship with her
[15:46] husband oh yeah think about the
[15:49] influence Church I begin to look in the
[15:51] Bible and I begin to think of two men
[15:53] true fathers and their influence and I
[15:56] look at the influence of Noah look at
[15:58] his influence honey Noah he preached for
[16:01] 120 years young people I want you to get
[16:04] it the influence of your parents is not
[16:06] about stopping your fun especially if
[16:10] they are Christians holy the influence
[16:12] of a parent hurry
[16:14] is that you may make it to the rapture
[16:18] that's what it's all about
[16:20] they're trying to stop you full they
[16:23] trying to mess up relationships they're
[16:26] trying to save you
[16:27] it's so often God is misunderstood in
[16:31] his people and you know you look at Noah
[16:33] you think about it for the first 10
[16:36] years
[16:37] he probably preached the same message
[16:39] he's gonna rain
[16:40] he's gonna rain honey he didn't change
[16:43] the text he probably even changed his
[16:45] suit he's gonna rain every time he came
[16:48] to church it's gonna rain and father
[16:50] came hurry up in the evening time he's
[16:52] go rain they came in the morning
[16:54] it's go rain they came on the holidays
[16:56] this terrain Easter message
[16:58] this terrain Christmas message mr. rain
[17:02] every holiday President's Day it's going
[17:05] honey he preached the same message hugs
[17:08] and his family his family probably
[17:10] looked at him and Noah was misunderstood
[17:13] but he knew he heard from God he knew
[17:16] that message he knew he's been
[17:18] influenced by higher power
[17:20] what was that influence that influence
[17:23] hallelujah was there that they may
[17:25] escape judgment honey and your family
[17:32] looked at him and you know can you
[17:34] imagine his boys you know they probably
[17:38] athletes
[17:39] because they said let's take a break
[17:42] from from the arc and it's gonna shoot
[17:45] some hoops today I want to work with my
[17:48] crossover you know I got on some new
[17:50] jobs I think I can jump now you know
[17:53] Noah he might have a son we ain't got
[17:57] time for that
[17:57] it's gonna rain huh
[18:01] and brother Adam they probably looked at
[18:03] they dad and they say this man crazy we
[18:06] can't have no fun we can't do nothing
[18:08] all right here is about this message
[18:10] it's gonna rain honey why church no I
[18:13] heard from God he was under the
[18:16] influence he was not doing his will he
[18:19] was doing God's will and him being
[18:22] misunderstood that whole message was dad
[18:25] to save his family
[18:27] it wasn't about him honey so you know
[18:31] it's ten years later nice 20 years it's
[18:34] the rain still preaching it's gonna rain
[18:38] 30 years later it's gonna rain 40 years
[18:41] later its terrain 60 years later there's
[18:44] no rain it didn't change why cuz the
[18:47] influence was great when you're being
[18:54] influenced by God you cannot shake it
[18:59] subtly it's not your wheel its history
[19:03] uglier remember Jesus was going to the
[19:06] cross he said lord if it be possible
[19:08] take this cup from me honey that was the
[19:12] influence of his fresh the god of glory
[19:17] honey got to a space where the devil
[19:21] tried to influence his fresh honey but
[19:25] the Commission the Word of God was
[19:27] greater in his life hallelujah and he
[19:30] says nevertheless not my will but thy
[19:33] will be done there was a greater
[19:35] influence and what did that influence
[19:39] you that influence changed the way we
[19:43] would live forever huh it changed our
[19:50] lives forever that's what that influence
[19:53] but you know you look at Noah and you
[19:56] think about it maybe one day maybe it's
[20:00] about 70 years later he's still
[20:02] preaching it's going you know there were
[20:06] other men and probably other preachers
[20:08] in that day as a man you need to preach
[20:10] someone look different the people need a
[20:12] little bit more entertainment but no one
[20:14] said all I got is just one message it's
[20:17] gonna rain oh yeah with that we don't
[20:19] want to be influenced by popular opinion
[20:22] we want to say well God has us to say
[20:24] hallelujah we want to be where God has
[20:27] us to be honey
[20:28] and I don't care that our prophet has
[20:31] been gone for 50 years I'm still under
[20:33] the influence hurry that there will be a
[20:36] rapture honey and that this message
[20:39] holier that our prophet honey William
[20:42] Branham was not influenced by the
[20:44] Catholic Church not influenced by the
[20:47] Pentecostal church not influenced hardly
[20:49] about a Baptist or the Methodist but his
[20:51] influence came directly from the pillar
[20:54] fire you say brother legs why are you so
[21:04] excited cuz I'm under the influence and
[21:11] I guarantee you I guarantee you heaven
[21:16] won't be like this ain't gonna be no

[22:47] changed right now Carly Turk do you
[22:52] realize we are the waters holy that's
[22:55] been losing the rapture to take place

[23:43] influenced all the daughters of Zion all
[23:46] the daughters of Israel she grabbed a
[23:48] tambourine honey do you realize the
[23:50] tambourine Holly was an instrument that
[23:53] was produced in bondage
[23:57] oh they were in bondage and instruments
[24:00] of praise hallelujah Church can you
[24:04] imagine you read that story and do they
[24:07] get on the other side and she brings out
[24:09] the tambourine and she starts to dancing
[24:11] she's under the influence she's under

[28:43] God is on this pulpit preacher
[28:46] hallelujah God is still standing behind
[28:49] skin the pillar of fire became a man
[28:53] hallelujah hallelujah God being
[28:58] misunderstood hallelujah we look at
[29:00] preachers as men no those preachers are
[29:02] ordained of God in there under an
[29:06] influence can you imagine when we get
[29:11] there get in heaven and we're under the
[29:14] influence of a celebration Kevin's going
[29:19] to be a celebration you think about it
[29:24] when we get together they have our
[29:26] little potlucks and you didn't prepare
[29:29] Joe dish and you said well they won't
[29:31] taste my beans today I cook these beans

[29:39] don't love these beans Church hurry up
[29:41] when we get to heaven it's gonna be the
[29:44] best of the best can you imagine those
[29:48] that we read about in the Bible we're
[29:50] gonna be there with them early then they
[29:54] might not hallelujah see my name in the
[29:56] Bible but when I get there they gonna
[29:58] know who I am

[30:04] hurry up without them I ain't complete
[30:07] oh hey so there's be no power without me
[30:14] there'd be no Abraham without me earlier
[30:17] he's the father faint what made him the
[30:20] father faint us his children because
[30:25] we're the promise of that faith oh don't
[30:29] play but you look I'm gonna be long
[30:33] y'all know about clothes
[30:35] think about what's influency let me let
[30:38] me let me hit something the prophet of
[30:39] God said when we think about influence
[30:42] he says he's doing influence that there
[30:47] is an influence from above he said God
[30:52] saves you and he influences you to get
[30:55] the Holy Ghost and from the Holy Ghost
[30:58] you go into the presence of God hungry
[31:00] and to the presence of God hardly to the
[31:03] life of God to living with God all that
[31:06] starts were being influenced to give
[31:08] your life to be a believer and then
[31:11] Satan has this influence that comes from
[31:12] the underworld and it starts with
[31:15] backslide it starts with going backwards
[31:18] instead of forward and then you open
[31:20] yourself up to spirits earlier spirits
[31:24] that'll keep you from headed
[31:26] you see I Satan does he perverts the
[31:29] truth come on but when we look at a real
[31:34] influence hunger you know catch Ruth she
[31:40] knew nothing about God she wasn't more
[31:43] bite
[31:43] you know she come from a heathen
[31:45] background but she married into a family
[31:49] holier and she didn't know the full
[31:51] potential of that family honey and you
[31:54] know that she watched a limb awaken
[31:56] Naomi the Bible I mean the prophet of
[31:58] God said that Naomi and eliminate those
[32:02] two names put together
[32:03] it meant Pleasant worship so she watched
[32:08] the life she was a marriage a pleasant
[32:11] worship oh yeah so when it was time to
[32:14] make decisions all she could think about
[32:16] was what was in front of her all she
[32:18] could think about was that Pleasant
[32:20] worship and then Naomi says hey my
[32:23] daughter I have no more children I have
[32:26] no husband for you so you might as well
[32:28] go back to your mama all for said deuces
[32:30] I'm out of here
[32:33] loafers and peace I'm going back to my
[32:36] denomination I'm going back where I come
[32:38] from I'm out of here
[32:39] mother-in-law you've been good but my
[32:41] husband dead and I got needs
[32:48] don't let your knees influence you out
[32:51] of the presence of God oh my so she
[32:57] leaves and Naomi you know like I said no
[33:01] you only said wherever you go I'm going
[33:03] yo God is my god
[33:05] but you large I lost Naomi says
[33:07] basically who you are is life and she
[33:13] didn't even realize how you here what
[33:15] who Naomi really was Naomi said okay I'm
[33:19] going back home
[33:20] follow my influence I'm going back home
[33:22] and what did Naomi do honey
[33:24] Naomi how do you led her right to her
[33:27] kiss me Redeemer
[33:28] oh yeah so the right influence will lead
[33:32] you to the climax of your life
[33:34] hallelujah she thought she had a good
[33:36] husband but Naomi rather took a redeemer
[33:40] a kinsman redeemer a type of Christ
[33:43] hallelujah going and once she made that
[33:47] Union
[33:47] she begins connect in ways that she
[33:50] couldn't do with our first husband
[33:52] hallelujah and test
[33:54] she went from just being a regular woman
[33:56] honey to now she's married to the type
[33:59] of Christ she even realized her husband
[34:06] was under an influence her husband's
[34:09] mother name was rare honey Rahab was
[34:14] influenced earlier by God even though
[34:17] she had a life it looked like she was
[34:20] influenced by prostitution but that was
[34:22] the will of God you know we look at some
[34:26] things and we wonder why we go through
[34:28] what we go through the prophet of God
[34:31] say is simply God projecting himself let
[34:35] me encourage you if you got trouble in
[34:39] your life you got difficulties in your
[34:44] life you're wondering right now what
[34:47] shall I do

[34:50] control
[34:51] oh yeah God is in control the devil can
[34:56] never sneak up on God
[34:59] and matter of fact God tells him who to
[35:03] give the child to did he do that the
[35:08] devil came to church one day when the
[35:11] sons of God were presenting themselves
[35:12] and the Bible says and Satan came also
[35:14] and he came and God say hey devil what

[35:24] mess up somebody like and then God says
[35:26] hey have you considered my servant Joe
[35:29] Dawsey I got somebody for you to try so

[36:22] hurry it's being blessed because she
[36:26] followed me only honey but Naomi knowing

[39:26] tails are the right influence they look
[39:30] Turks the rain was coming so hard
[39:33] hurry that it lifts that big old massive
[39:35] boat up I believe it only had one window

[41:02] man holy this is a claim that will never
[41:05] expire you don't need no adjustments
[41:08] hurry we're going but you know Church
[41:11] you look at life
[41:12] the Bible says the Bible says the sins
[41:14] of Sodom thanks like righteous soul and
[41:17] you know what lies family fell under his
[41:21] influence that's why it's very important
[41:25] as demanding your house to keep your
[41:27] standards cuz your children depending on
[41:31] your wife's depend on honey keep your
[41:34] standards
[41:34] hold your ground man because yo if yo if
[41:38] your beliefs a weak it affect your
[41:39] family

[41:45] weak it will affect your family honey so
[41:48] you have to hire you be strong in the
[41:50] Lord and can you imagine like he's
[41:53] looking down at Sodom he wasn't even
[41:55] there yet but he's looking at Sodom and
[41:58] the glamour and the glitz of Sodom
[42:00] influenced him and he left where he was
[42:04] with Abraham and he went down the side
[42:07] so what lie did light put his family in
[42:11] harm's way why cuz he fell into the
[42:14] wrong influence
[42:15] I believe the prophet of God said he
[42:17] became governor over the city and you
[42:19] know we always talk about remember Lot's
[42:22] wife she was in our condition because
[42:24] her husband

[42:32] influences of the world are nothing to
[42:34] play with don't play with the devil
[42:37] because I guarantee he's stronger than
[42:39] what you think huh they're people I know
[42:43] right now honey who got out there and

[44:14] something that's because God didn't
[44:15] allow it it ain't because you're good

[44:25] something who's gonna give God more

[47:04] David said it was good for me that I was
[47:07] afflicted whose bill for me that I was a
[47:12] fling he said because before I was
[47:15] afflicted I went astray honey what is
[47:18] God doing if you going through something
[47:19] it's God trying to put you on the right
[47:21] path

[48:08] I have searched it's going down the road
[48:10] and I was think about my struggle
[48:13] I don't think about my trial and then
[48:15] you know what came the words of my
[48:17] pastor that Satan can do nothing but
[48:20] what God allowed do you know what I did

[48:48] but now we're in the time of climax
[48:51] we're in the time of climax one thing I
[48:55] love about the Bible is that God takes
[49:00] his man but he keeps his spirit he keeps
[49:02] that influence gone and you look at
[49:05] Moses the Bible says he talks about
[49:07] Moses there was nobody more humble than
[49:08] Moses it was another man like Moses but
[49:11] what was the climax was Moses ministry
[49:13] what was the greatest influence Moses
[49:16] had on the people
[49:17] it was Joshua because Moses ministry the
[49:23] climax of his ministry was a Joshua
[49:25] somebody that could in somebody that
[49:28] could could finish what he started
[49:31] somebody that was under his influence
[49:33] but not only under it when Moses left he
[49:36] continued early that's when you know you
[49:39] under the right influence people can
[49:42] leave church they can talk about the
[49:43] pastor all these things but you ever
[49:45] meet God you ever meet God you'll
[49:49] continue hallelujah and you know when we
[49:53] look in the Bible and we see that God
[49:56] brought a profit on the scene named
[49:57] Elijah what was the climax of Elijah's
[49:59] life it was Elijah
[50:01] oh hey man he likes her lujah influence
[50:07] he likes a man and remember just
[50:09] like roof he he tried to get rid of me
[50:11] say nope well there you go I'm gonna yo
[50:15] God is my god when you crossed the river
[50:18] I'm across the river
[50:19] your next step gonna be my next step oh
[50:22] he was under the influence what
[50:24] influence he was under he was under
[50:26] divine intervention huh
[50:30] he wasn't just following the elijah he
[50:33] was following God huh in church as we
[50:38] look through the Bibles and we see how
[50:40] things go
[50:41] you looked at John the Baptist was such
[50:42] a great man but what was the climax what
[50:45] was the greatest influence that John
[50:47] could ever give to the people it was
[50:49] Jesus huh cuz the dough that followed
[50:54] John they met up with Jesus earlier that
[50:57] was the climax of his influence a man
[50:59] because he said I must decrease so that
[51:01] he can increase honey
[51:03] so church yo influence should lead you
[51:06] into your adoption this church thing
[51:10] about brother Bruce's churches about you
[51:13] hallelujah if you take the message of
[51:16] the hour and you ask yourself what was
[51:21] brother branham's greatest achievement
[51:24] who's the third pool it was it was it
[51:28] the boo wasn't stopping storms no his
[51:31] greatest achievement was not getting in
[51:33] God's Way and preaching a message that
[51:38] we could hear and understand honey
[51:40] so the climax of brother Benno's
[51:43] ministry is you and I hurry because
[51:46] we're taking this message and we're
[51:47] making it really good
[51:50] this message is no longer see when it
[51:53] climaxes it changes into a greater form
[51:56] Haru you just like from John the Jesus
[51:58] amen Church the climax of this of this
[52:01] message honey is changing the form of it
[52:04] from boots and tanks to a person
[52:06] hallelujah we are the climax of this
[52:09] message will you see me hurry you see
[52:12] the revelation of Jesus Christ but when
[52:15] I see you I see the opening of the seals
[52:20] but I see you I see the word
[52:24] I see spoken word authority holy play
[52:30] but instead influence and to close with
[52:34] my opening statement my opening
[52:36] scripture God comes
[52:41] we're already here in second chronicles
[52:44] the story between 1/2 and Joseph and
[52:48] Joseph and was a king hey I was a king
[52:53] ahab's red was the king of Judah hey I
[52:55] was the king of Israel let me say this
[52:58] yeah new by God but what men say I'm up
[53:03] he's falling his wife he had a wicked
[53:06] wife we get James Jezebel and you know
[53:09] they did one day they went and killed an
[53:12] innocent man and took his vineyard
[53:14] neighbors and God didn't like God said
[53:17] you're gonna pay for that the dogs gonna
[53:20] lick your blood in the same spot where
[53:22] you killed neighbor that was a prophecy
[53:25] but you know it looked like it wasn't
[53:27] gonna happen cuz am a hab new God am
[53:31] praying honey that God have mercy go
[53:34] back and read read in your Bible the
[53:36] Bible says God says you see how am
[53:39] humbled himself before me through
[53:42] fasting and prayer I'm not gonna bring
[53:44] the judgment on in him
[53:45] i'ma bringing in his sons day honey
[53:48] that's because this man was influenced
[53:51] he was still under the influence even
[53:53] though he had a wicked wife but he
[53:58] messed up cuz he found his wife so God
[54:01] still had to make it work on the past I
[54:03] preached a message called God being
[54:07] politically incorrect the thing that you
[54:12] think he gonna do he do something
[54:14] different a lot I need you to do this I
[54:22] need to do they do a completely
[54:23] different way so lord I need another car
[54:28] he's doing a whole different way
[54:30] Oh Lord I need money to pay these be he
[54:33] doing a whole different way he's not
[54:35] politically correct
[54:37] he does it incorrectly why to show us
[54:41] that all we have to do is believe and
[54:45] you look Church he could easily gave
[54:50] Abraham and Sarah a child but God being
[54:54] politically incorrect Kolya he does
[54:57] things earlier that seemed impossible to
[55:02] make it possible you took a woman that
[55:04] was old a man that was overly and gave
[55:07] him a child after 25 years of it being
[55:10] spoken and believed politically
[55:14] incorrect honey but you know Church he
[55:19] tears he says Jehoshaphat they have am
[55:23] coming together
[55:24] he's hey you help me go and take
[55:28] ramoth-gilead and jobs Vance a foot show
[55:31] me you bro we brothers I got your back
[55:34] what to fight I fight who make you mad
[55:38] make me mad we're in this thing together
[55:40] the Dean it was just something a little
[55:42] strange about in in Joseph and spirit
[55:46] Joseph si but wait let's inquire of the
[55:50] Lord even though he agreed he still had
[55:54] another influence inside he said is
[55:57] there not another voice in the lake
[55:59] honey and then a I'm says yes it is yes
[56:03] it is but he never says anything good
[56:05] about so he was already under the
[56:08] influence that he was wrong he knew if
[56:14] he with the mic macaé
[56:16] that Mikael was gonna tell him that he
[56:17] was wrong see a lot of times we do
[56:20] things that we already know we on the
[56:22] wrong influence preachers turn out to
[56:24] come and preach all that like you living
[56:27] in what you're doing and all that stuff
[56:28] you already know if you are a human
[56:31] being you have condemnation already a
[56:38] woman a woman that's been in the
[56:40] presence of God she knows she dressing
[56:42] roll sometimes she only want to look in
[56:48] the mirror because she knows too sure
[56:53] what do you think about this the Prophet
[56:54] God said you got a question don't wait
[56:59] you got a question that means doubt
[57:02] that's it we make things too complicated
[57:04] just simpler we live the more we see God
[57:08] now like Church but you see these two
[57:12] that come together and in a abscess and
[57:16] says hey we're gonna inquire for him but
[57:19] I'm gonna tell you right now he goes
[57:20] thing than good so they go down to
[57:23] mkhaya
[57:23] him they send the messages down there
[57:26] and Micaiah said hey go up okay
[57:30] go take the land go am say did not tell
[57:34] you to tell me what the lord say he
[57:36] already know he wrote simply because the
[57:44] prophet mkhaya is telling him what he
[57:47] won't hear but he's no hero so he said
[57:50] can be what god's sake he said well if
[57:55] you even come back God never even spoke
[58:00] to me he gets mad because the man told
[58:04] him the truth he smacks the prophet he
[58:08] said oh you eat on that give him bread
[58:09] of affliction in water and so forth I
[58:11] did with you and I get back but what I
[58:14] want you to realize about this whole
[58:15] story God had already said the air will
[58:20] you kill neighbors the dogs gonna kill
[58:22] blood huh so not anybody to go to battle
[58:25] and God says who what can I do to
[58:29] influence am to go to this battle and
[58:31] then the Bible says God now being
[58:34] politically incorrect come hallelujah
[58:36] the Spirit comes up and says Lord send
[58:39] me what kind of spirit wasn't it was a
[58:41] lying spirit
[58:42] oh man those prophets saying God God
[58:47] they were under the influence of a lying
[58:50] spirit but Church God allowed it God
[58:56] used a lying spirit hallelujah
[58:58] that is word may come to pass
[59:04] I can do what he want and you don't
[59:07] think that's heavy check this out
[59:08] the Bible says in Proverbs that is
[59:10] second thing God hate one of them is
[59:12] what a lying tongue and not lying spirit
[59:16] come up to God he said Lord use me gods
[59:19] they go in spirit prophesy why did why
[59:27] did God allow that lion spirit to move
[59:30] so he's working come to pass sometimes
[59:35] we wonder why things happen and why
[59:37] we're got this way God in control y'all
[59:41] ain't doing it right on me God letting
[59:42] it happen
[59:43] oh yeah you told David don't worry about
[59:46] it everything under control
[59:48] let it go in he said I let the head is
[59:52] his dog there's a no don't worry about
[59:53] everything all right
[59:54] you know when David died he told Solomon
[59:57] he said everyone to tell me about that I
[59:58] want you to kill honey the time gonna
[1:00:03] come but the thing over this church you
[1:00:05] want to be on the right side of
[1:00:07] influence amen we're in a time now where
[1:00:11] there's so much going on but we need to
[1:00:15] take a step back take a step back seeing
[1:00:18] what I love about Jehoshaphat once
[1:00:22] Jehoshaphat escaped she house the fans
[1:00:24] ain't no we're gonna turn this thing
[1:00:25] around we don't turn this around i
[1:00:28] hain't fellowship with him Domo
[1:00:29] let's get this together huh - faint
[1:00:32] calling Solomon seamless not a fast and
[1:00:34] pray everything turned the whole kingdom
[1:00:35] around don't be afraid to backtrack and
[1:00:39] turn things around you do matter what
[1:00:41] you've done
[1:00:42] God's grace is great I got I got I got
[1:00:47] something I like to say to myself but
[1:00:50] rich I like to say God is greater than
[1:00:53] greatness can you believe that he's
[1:00:59] greater than greatness now they say they
[1:01:03] say that uh Muhammad Ali was one of the
[1:01:05] most greatest boxers ever to live but
[1:01:08] God is great surely they say they say
[1:01:11] uh-uh Abraham Lincoln was a great
[1:01:14] president but God is great
[1:01:17] holy you say Solomon was a great man but
[1:01:19] God is great a honey the greatest thing
[1:01:22] you can think about God is greater he's
[1:01:25] greater than greatness honey
[1:01:27] things that the world may exalt God is
[1:01:30] great honey
[1:01:32] that's who we serve so let's make sure
[1:01:35] we're on the right side of influence cuz
[1:01:39] like I said not him with just you take a
[1:01:41] drunk person we all we all may have
[1:01:44] family members that go to the cookout
[1:01:46] and then cook out the real them come out
[1:01:50] and come up to you cuz they got that
[1:01:53] spirit in a system and they got courage
[1:01:57] and now they're gonna tell you how they
[1:02:00] really feel about you you think you too
[1:02:06] good I never liked him see that spirit
[1:02:13] that influence is allowing the real them
[1:02:17] to come out but with name other day
[1:02:21] influence they play it cuz how you doing
[1:02:23] good seat
[1:02:25] you need anything can I do something
[1:02:27] with all this just put on because we
[1:02:31] ain't ain't able to control their
[1:02:33] thoughts anymore the real them comes out
[1:02:35] and that's what God wants us to be he
[1:02:38] wants us to be in a place where we're
[1:02:39] not able to control our own thoughts
[1:02:42] that's the problem with church we love
[1:02:45] control and you know even in the
[1:02:47] atmosphere like just where I can feel
[1:02:49] the power of God moving y'all can feel
[1:02:51] it too but you got better control than I
[1:02:53] got nobody's everything all right but I
[1:03:00] ain't gonna shout today so I feel it
[1:03:07] enough going though I don't see enough
[1:03:08] going on you better stop being
[1:03:10] influenced by your eyes your eyes a lot
[1:03:12] to you huh
[1:03:14] I didn't oh don't trust your eyes your
[1:03:17] eyes can't see the angels in this room
[1:03:19] hallelujah your eyes can't see the
[1:03:22] divine all in this room your eyes can't
[1:03:25] see that God is in this room don't trust
[1:03:28] your eyes
[1:03:29] floors by the Word of God hosts your
[1:03:33] eyes I lied to you honey your eyes I'll
[1:03:36] make an S look like an eight don't trust
[1:03:41] your eyes you trust the Word of God
[1:03:44] let's follow them to the right influence
[1:03:46] holy and you know Church one thing I
[1:03:49] realize is that there's nothing the
[1:03:52] enemy can do honey
[1:03:54] I said again then I'll catch God by
[1:03:56] surprise you know like it like I always
[1:03:59] say here you got practical jokers
[1:04:02] you know like family members and
[1:04:03] different people you walking in the room
[1:04:05] and they jump I shake you up a little
[1:04:10] bit scare you a little bit practical
[1:04:15] jokers but you know some people when
[1:04:19] they get scared they're scared is this
[1:04:20] aggressive
[1:04:24] so why you jump out on him you find
[1:04:28] something you find something you weren't
[1:04:30] ready for and that's how it is with God
[1:04:34] in the jump you imagine Satan sneaking
[1:04:37] up on God and God just death he he's
[1:04:44] all-knowing
[1:04:45] he knows Satan every move every step he
[1:04:49] know what he gonna do before he do
[1:04:51] because God ordained it you know Satan
[1:04:54] thinks he's sneaking up on God I'm gonna
[1:04:57] miss this life up and then he jumps out
[1:05:01] thinking God ain't ready he's just like
[1:05:04] oh my gosh Wow every time and it ain't
[1:05:11] no mistake God don't miss he knows
[1:05:13] exactly how to deal with the enemy huh
[1:05:17] let's understand something God is so
[1:05:21] great he created his own enemy he knows
[1:05:30] how it takes who knows his strengths and
[1:05:33] his weaknesses hallelujah God can't even
[1:05:36] take the battery out of the devil
[1:05:39] that's not great our God is and y'all
[1:05:43] y'all want to tell me that it's not a
[1:05:45] good thing to be able to that kind of
[1:05:47] influence with a God who is all knowing
[1:05:50] hallelujah he knows our every move out
[1:05:52] every step and he's put things in
[1:05:54] position Church think about it honey
[1:05:57] before he saw and Jacob was ever born
[1:06:00] God said I love Jacob and Haiti song
[1:06:02] they hadn't done anything got it already
[1:06:05] put Jacob in the past that would favor
[1:06:08] his life even though it wasn't it didn't
[1:06:10] look politically correct look like he
[1:06:14] saw was a better man honey but Jacob has
[1:06:17] promised huh why because God had
[1:06:22] influences in his life
[1:06:23] certain things had to happen huh he had
[1:06:26] to he had to trick his daddy with a lie
[1:06:28] can you imagine God ordaining God
[1:06:32] ordaining his puppet daddy to be
[1:06:34] deceived
[1:06:36] why so he get the birth right cuz you
[1:06:41] already said that the older goes serve
[1:06:43] the younger
[1:06:44] so god I gotta let certain things take
[1:06:46] place so it's working come to pass honey
[1:06:49] oh yeah that's what happens in our life
[1:06:53] nothing happens by chance
[1:06:56] God is in control Amen this bliss let's
[1:07:02] pray let's pray
[1:07:08] I want y'all to believe that this
[1:07:10] service this service this morning it's
[1:07:15] just the beginning of what God gonna do
[1:07:17] today honey I want you to believe that
[1:07:21] we haven't even experienced the
[1:07:23] greatness of God today there's more of
[1:07:26] God to get hungry let's pray let's pray
