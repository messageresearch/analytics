more minutes so we had to wait an extra 30 minutes we appreciate your waiting god bless you I gotta get this iPad to working okay as we stand we appreciate the Lord Psalms 86 please we'll start there and keep moving by God's grace Psalms eight and six thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hand thou has put all things under his feet one more scripture first John three one two three such a beautiful day outside thank God for His grace I trust that the Sun will shine in this place amen first John three one through three [Music] it reads behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for everything you've done for us thus far you have been better to us Lord than we have been to ourselves thank you dear Jesus thank you for bringing us long in the dangerous streets and highways without any hurt hummer danger coming upon this Lord thank your father give him a wife a special blessing for driving force Lord and forgive us our any anxieties that we would have inflicted upon her Lord we pray father God that you bless the service in a special way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to just be going on tonight our topic in which I spoke this morning our position in Christ and and what we were working with by God's grace is that we are at a time in a place where we ought to know who we are how long will it take before the bride come to a place to understand who she is now brother Branham tells us that once we come into that place we will become an invincible army and I think they are the word army kind of makes people think that it's gonna be such great group but as individual we will collect and connect with one another at whatever specific time that God has ordained for us to do so I mean if it's just two or three on the side two or three will become the army of God remember now God took one man and as an army by the name of Moses and invaded Egypt so you've got to understand when God's a army he doesn't necessarily mean a great host of people because even when it came to Gideon God didn't use 30,000 at the time God used about 300 that couldn't to destroy about a few thousand so God had to you know his his way of counting is not the way we count but we understand that I'm one man can be an army for God is that right oh it is that way even among the Angels wormwood said Lord I destroyed the earth amen in an ant eluvian day let me go down and I'll turn everything upside down so you've got to realize amen God doesn't need plural as we see it he in a vast number he can use two or three is that right where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the mist and that's all you need amen when we talk about our position you and I must understand the Bible says now are we the sons of God and I was as I was saying to the church this morning God is not talking about a now in your head he's talking about our now in your heart you understand me this is the throne of God this is where God operates not here he rules on the throne of your heart is that right this is why David said yea though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I will fear no evil because thou art with me any man when God is with you you are the majority not the minority now I'll prepare the table before me in the presence of my enemies now I've known as my head with oil my cup runneth over amen so we understand that even in this battle and like I said once you come to understand your position like God said I would that you be the head and not the tail is that right so you and I must understand that whenever we are in battle if we will properly take our position we come out as a victim it is only when we wreck we do not recognize our position in Christ he is undefeated hallelujah and you and I must understand greater is He that is in us that in he that is in the world and remember I said not in your head is in your heart once the revelation of God is in your heart you become the greater room not the less than the greater so knowing that position as we know by God's grace amen there there is a church called the Queen of Heaven but you and I must understand that we are the Queen of Heaven we are the real Queen of Heaven you can't be a queen without authority hallelujah and that's what Jesus said after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall receive authority that word power there means Authority and and in the prophet of God picked it up like this all that God was in God he pulled it into Christ all that was in Christ he pulled it into the church is that right and Jesus said if you abide in the vine and the vine abide in you you can add whatsoever you will Dominion that means you are the ruler you and I are the ruler is that right if the seers are open which they are and the shields put us back as the prophet of God said back into the day of Eden before the fall hallelujah before the fall that means we have dominion now we don't wait to heaven to get dominion is right when you when you talk about healing remember let's say why would we need a man healing the millennium when you already supernatural the millennium comes after the rapture after the rapture you have a supernatural body which we call a glorified body a man you never get sick you never get tired you never get weary but know your position because remember I told you that you and I must understand we are now the I am NOT the what I was or that I used to be Paul said we are Jesus Christ as he is we are in this world as he is not as he's going to be as he is as he ever said again as he is because what we do we allow this dimension to confuse us time cannot affect eternity hallelujah and we can see ourselves as he is we become either invincible that thought even brings on a translation as he is God is a spirit God is the only potentate he's Alpha he's Omega he's the beginning he's the ending he is and as he is so are we in this world we become invincible is that right see there was a church that was invincible in that church according to plan by way of political power and science the Catholic Church used to be invincible but Luther godly anointed a man by the name of Luther far because Luther recognized his position in Christ is that right if you can understand by God's grace and then the just shall live by faith I look up that faith by Bobby's the tortured one where says to get already rotted I can't here by car you understand me a man and through faith needs to come in from one way and go out the other right through faith Sara receive strength in other one she had to go through something for her full of faith to gain momentum minam hey man but if you ride know something you are doing nothing but resting right because it is the vehicle that you're riding on this taking you where you need to go and the just shall live by his faith all you have to all we have to do is get on his faith and ride it right no effort on our parts other than we get on it and let faith take us where we need to go Robert is that Alright hallelujah that's exactly what Rebecca did she got on that camel and that Campbell took her where she needed to go is that right brother branham rockin that Campbell as the anointing of God if you get into Christ you get on there nodding and that anointing will take you from earth to glory you understand me understanding your position so you can understand Rebecca understood her position when she made the choice to go with her in-laws she knew she was going to meet Isaac her husband she understood Amen that Ellie's ax was the vessel in which Abraham sent to bring her to Isaac but she didn't ride on ELISA she rolled on the caravel she wrote on Christ hallelujah it was the anointing that took her to Eleazar um excuse me tires excuse me so you must understand what I'm trying to say people don't understand the position in Christ and we're constantly looking back constantly looking back it's our right to see what brother Branham has done he's done what he's supposed to do but if we don't allow that same anointing like Elijah said Elisha said where is the god of Elijah he knew where he lied to us but he wanted to see the god of Elijah and the god of Elijah came on the scene and that's when he got a double portion is that right so you and I must understand what God is doing coming from the scripture according to Exodus 39 39 30 and 31 and they made and in here Dave at Moses is talking about the temple and what goes in the temple and what goes in the on the priests garments and everything else but here he's literally working with the crown that crowns the high priest and the high priest was a shadow on a type of the Lord Jesus right because he's the priest of all priests is that right he's me McKellar Dec y'all understand me so we know that it was a sin to go into the Holies of Holies amen as a sinner you had to go through justification you had to come through the brazen altar right you had to be washed you had to go through the lava you had to do all of that tape man and wash away your sin you had to come amen into the holy place which represent the golden candlesticks in' and those golden candlesticks represented seven church ages and those in that time the ministry the priests not the not the high priests but the priests itself was allowed to keep that lit and everything else is that right represented those church aides messengers that had to come and minister to the bride of those ages right but we understand that those candles could go out is that right and according to Matthew 25 those candles went out something without because it said three I'm your lamp right and somewhere the foolish version didn't trim and she found out that her oil was gone and the lights went out and you and I must understand but the foolish virgins trimmed her left youngest and me the ministry of the prophet of god the ministry of Malachi 4 came to gather us to a place where we can trim our lips get all the wax get all of the bee up off get all other decrees and the dog was and everything that had been been been been built up on these particular Church messengers and their ages we trimmed it all off and then so we could do what find our way to that Holies of Holies because you got to understand if those loves if that lamp wasn't burning it was pitch dark hallelujah because there is no sunlight for them pitch dark there so you needed a mint the seven golden candle you needed that camera to light the way to get into the Holies of Holies but once getting into the Holies of Holies you didn't need those lamps because behind the curtain was as a kind of glory so here Amen we find that Moses is saying here in in the 31st and they made a plate of the holy crown of pure gold and wrote upon it in a writing like to in the engraving of a signet holiness to the Lord and as I said even in this morning when you a crown represents something it represents victory somewhere you have won a contest for an example when they crown Miss America and they put that crown on her head Miss America is representing all of America right and she her beauty is a reflection of the country right because they have chosen the most beautiful the most talented supposedly woman to wear the crown hallelujah but here amen in this crown Amen that this is the high priest is wearing he says holiness to the Lord so what I'm trying to say is that the crown not only represents the faith the face of the person but it also represents the body the whole body is holiness to the Lord and it's crown with deity so you got to understand by God's grace and then it is crowned with deity and you all have seen the Catholic Church and they have those martyrs those might sir I might not pronounce it right mi T ar e which is a crown which is something that were wears you wear and it goes out like this it's kind of like a pyramid because that's the way it's supposed to be and that's the way it was with the priests they had this thing that went up kind of like to a point type of thing which was was that the type of a capstone is that right so you got to say well what are you trying to say brother Brooks because that high priest represented you and me cause see though you got to understand that's why you say what do you mean you got to understand that only the high priest was allowed to go beyond the curtain into the holy holy not just a regular priest you understand me for an example Abraham had a lot of children but all of them were not adopted hallelujah all of them then get full sonship only those who were adopted became Abraham's air right all that came by Isaac was two chosen so you got to understand so in this day everybody can't go behind the veil only those whom God has predestinated as the election right because Isaac was election and you and I must understand if you are under this message you have been chosen and elected to go behind the veil it is your inheritance right that's why Hebrew said that Jesus Christ has gone beyond the veil he has an anchor you understand me i Iike behind them they are anchor and I call her anchoring of the soul well behind in the Vale that means you're tied to the Inca you behind the veil and his purpose was this it meant that your soul go there come on somebody and won't be able to move knowing your position people say well what do you mean brothers i'ma tell y'all something David was king before he was crowned king he was an altered king he knew he was king he acted like a king he took the position of a king is that right his brothers were far more older than he was but when it came to define fighting Goliath he took his position Emin and the keen usually go out to battle first a real king gets in front of the army hallelujah to go battle and he went to battle Goliath somebody help me here see that's what I'm saying we can't as a bride of Jesus Christ we must understand we must take our position right the the decadence a denominations are back in the background they are afraid of what's happening here but there's got to be an anointed David somewhere that's going to take this position and defeat Goliath it must happen but you and I must understand we need the inspiration we need the anointing we need the revelation of who we are in this day you can't just move on your own it take God to unfold to you who you are and what time it is as what David said wait a minute is there not a cause look at what's happening around us is there not a cause somebody must be anointed a man to make this thing Leah y'all believe brother Branham had to hold the Holy Ghost brother Balin said I wish I could heal everybody he said but I can't why couldn't he he had the Holy Ghost he had to wait for his he had to wait to God inspired a God told him what to do hello somebody that's why we don't suddenly lay hand on people why because if God don't tell you to lay hand on somebody you can be taking something off of them that God put on it and if you take it off God gonna get you for doing it that's why I always say Lord not my will but let thine be done hmm but the true church sees you 19 she's coming to a place where she's beginning to see who she is because she's looking around and she knows she's not like the other girls is that right when whenever all ranches son died ranches are the ranches son needed a wife dad old girl who was washing dishes knew she was not like the other girls and somewhere in this message you've got to come to see you're not like everybody else I don't care if they're wearing the message garment you must understand you're not like the others they can be flirtatious they can do all the dances they can do everything but were you you are right when you're supposed to be you're working on character whoo and you can't do what they do you can't go where they go you can't act what they uh-huh oh yeah you're just a man do you have the saint yes millions would come out of Egypt and there were two and said we're not like those other girls they shouted they dance they played the tambourine hallelujah but there was two jobs when Carol said no no no we're gonna stay with the word y'all can do what you got to do but we staying with the word hallelujah is that right your position we're not at the end of this thing per tail we're at the head this is where we are we're where the head ship is to come and have full control over the body is that right and that's where we are right now the head ship is come is that right the seal of God has been opened the pillar of fire has returned and that purified no matter see what you got to understand is that Moses was Anna's own leader Moses was a follower he fathered the pillar fire he fathered the pillar of cloud he knew who his headship was and as he followed the pillar cloud the people followed him somebody helped me here so you and I understand when when it comes to lukewarmness we understand when you find yourself in a place of lukewarmness and you have become frommel and you have become powerless brother branham like anna as the spirit of the Antichrist it is the Antichrist that makes you like that Hey so all I'm weary I'm tired but listen no matter how weary and the tire you get there ought to be still joy on the inside and the Bible says a man that in the presence of the Lord there's form this old joy he that overcometh the Bible says the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before the Angels that means you got to overcome like I said this morning you must also realize that there are books that are being written everything you think everything you do if not confess is braced in the book is that right even the prophet of God when was dead behind the door when he would force he criticized the lady with purple hair and purple nails and purple this that and the other wherever she look he said lord I don't even know how you put up with this stuff you need to you know you were to destroy it causes come on behind the door all right sometime God has a call as a side it meant for us to see how we can arrested we are without the blood of Jesus God don't like surprises miss God want somebody who can humble himself hallelujah is that right the Pharisees in the sconces that you know in the marketplace law you can know that I paid my time and Lord you know I've been doing this knob Lord you know I've been given to the power yet that little publican smoked his breath this is God I'm not even worthy to call on your name and Jesus said which one you think will be received that man who knows is he or she is nothing hallelujah you know we God has made of everything but without God with nothing hallelujah is that right listen revelation says and they sung a new song saying down I'd rather to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and have redeemed us to God by the blood of our every kindred and tongue and people and nation and have made us unto our God kings and priests and that's the thing we've always quoting that but we hardly ever see anybody take that position when you're gonna do it when are we going to do it we must come to know our position is that right when brother Branham he didn't first he at the first he didn't know he was a prophet he didn't even know he was the prophet of Malachi for he evolved into the littlest God brought him into it God even used a witch to tell him that you was born on a special day y'all understand me he didn't know and he was trying to get away from the witch and here we was the gift of God to the and yet he did not as of yet knew he didn't know it hello when he first met his first wife he didn't know who he was God sent him down there to those Pentecostals and his mother Lord talked him out of it had he known Louisville he would have stayed there he literally changed the events of time that's what he said had he remarried to stay there no telling what his ministry would have blossom out into but anyway my point is God has an appointed time for us to come to recognize who we really are but as you're moving he wasn't backing up he kept moving forward even through all his trials even through his tests he kept moving forward and you and I must continue to move forward no matter how many times we falter no matter how many times we fail God is going to bring us like I said the other day as long you got to go down before you come up getting numb but the truth you got to go down before you come up most of us know what we used to be we went down before we came up to this and in this time in this present time you and I must recognized this that when each trial like I wanted to say this morning I didn't just chance to say it when when God said they have become as we are knowing good and evil the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and God knew before Adam fell that evil was coming matter of fact he put the tree there he made it there and he gave them the choice but he knew what they were going to do because he also knew in order for us a beat like him we had no girl from evil and since that tree since that fall we have been worked by good and evil you can't get out of it I don't care if you go to a monastery evil is there because you are there huh you don't have to teach a child to lie evil is dead you don't have to teach a child to be jealous evil is there you understand me so I'm saying this is why the scripture picks it up all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord you will do wrong you're going to do evil but I'm gonna work it around for your good hallelujah is that right the Bible according revelation the third chapter said calm try me I'm calling you try it gold tried in the fire hallelujah that means that man there's going to be a fire that's going to try you but it will burn all of the worldliness out of you all of the drug will come out of you hallelujah by way of fire thinking that strange when you father to divers temptation knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold whoo like I try to tell people I said you know according to the Word of God Exodus the fourth chapter Amen here it was they meant Moses should have circumcised his his sons and he didn't he forgot he got busy and his wife Zipporah see that's what I'm saying that wives support represents the church Moses represents the preacher but the church should never forget her children needs to be circumcised and guess what every surah every one that's not circle sighs we'll be put away it didn't matter if he was Jewish you had to be circumcised you've got to have the Holy Ghost hey if you don't get it let me read it the way the Prophet says he said and where we are doing today that's where the Holiness Church has failed we've got too much time the Lord has got give us a lot of money we've got buildings great big churches and big spires and putting less seats and pipe organs until we've got the seal of God until we forgot the seal of God is that right what good is it going to do us with all the deep message Rees what good is going to do you amen the knowing God sent a prophet and the seven seals are open and the thunders and all of these said what good is it gonna do you it's just gonna give you an intellectual revival that ain't what we need we need the seal of God is that right Ezekiel shouted he said he said you told that angel kill and destroy everything that doesn't have the mark of God in their forehand hallelujah kill it all lock it all tear it up from the young to the old from the ancient to the young y'all knows nobody that's right every male is in Egypt of Israel that wasn't circumcised was cut off circumcision was the seal of the promise and circumcision of the Old Testament is the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the new y'all hear me it must be done he we don't have an option I don't get all right I'm right but there's got to be a manifestation of it but that right what good is this lightbulb if I cut it on and it won't light up yeah you gotta have some power inside it has to have some kind of mechanism that will connect with the power in there that's going to illuminate it otherwise the barbers room just might as well just throw it away what good is a Christian if there is no light if there is no light people can see Christ in you what is that you're a dead light bulb right people need to see Jesus and if they can't see Jesus what good like think about it if the salt loses Savior if you can't help something be preserved you're no good is that right and the Bible tells us that the bride or the children of God we are the salt of the earth we are the preserver but once once we lose our preservative of being able to preserve what glue you if you become like the world you just like the world you just as good as this dirt you might as well be trotted upon you understand me everything has a season is that right we have a winter summer spring and fall and we need all of it right we need that spring we need that summer we need that fall and we need that winter those seasons were given to us any Christians have four seasons hmm but I can guarantee you even if that tree could talk that tree would say oh I'm so glad the sun is shining in the right place now could see the Sun don't never stop shining it's just ain't shining exactly where you wanted to shine hallelujah amen but you want that Sun to shine in the right place so like and little so you can live through that the life is in you we all go through it but don't mean we finished because you know what happens right you go down and the grave the SAP goes down and you may stop right there right for the winter but when the summer comes and that SAP began to move again guess where you get new lives you get new leaves and in if you're mature enough you get some fruit if it's a fruit tree so you gotta understand knowing your position one thing I love about trees is that they don't get up and walk I thought about my trees and I said Oh Lord I'm glad I'm one of those walking trees I'm a human being right but I think about the other day when that coal was blowing and woohoo Lord and that tree was just catching couldn't even put on the overcoat hallelujah but God has a way of preserving his life by allowing that SAP to go down into the root and guess what the thing that would have been cold one day - it was becomes a blanket is that Alright whoo you love the Lord when we look and see by God's grace how God has been so good to us and you think you're what do you mean brother books I'm saying did you know let me read this according to numbers 21 and 14 it says wherefore is it said in the book of wars of the law when I heard that I'm like wow you mean to tell me that there's a book of wars all the wars that Israel go through are recorded and I thought if that be the case all of our wars all of our battles and guess what God just don't put out the good ones only there are times the Israel was on the run and God put it right there in there you know the only thing that we erase your bad wars it's the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus make you a conqueror the blood of Jesus make you victorious every time why because he became our righteousness where we failed he won he becomes our righteousness when right we become scuse me we've become his righteousness and he becomes our sin oh I love that cuz every time the devil think he's got me it's an illusion the devil can never get me he could never get you you so what do you mean let me tell you something even though was it Wesley I think that had a sink I know when Wesley which one of those three they did they smoked Luther Luther smoked and I think it was Luther Wesley one of the two thought that Israel was the Antichrist hello but they're all spear was in the palm seven stars in the palm is head yet they made mistakes but their mistakes were not in a place to condemn them or to make them lose because they were already in the body hello somebody twelve disciples all of them were different all of them made mistakes and yet their throne set they're in heaven waiting for them hallelujah you and I must understand we must know our position when you come into Christ about said you are now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus I didn't say all hear him I didn't say all around him I said in him and guess what no matter how bad your life seemed to be and how dark is seem to be if you are in Christ you are in light because God said there I know there is no darkness in him I don't know how he does it but that's what the Bible says in him there is no darkness do you think about it there all right there's only one church and that means that they are born into the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the oligos and that's why the devil tricked this age he tricked the age and he said yo you got the Holy Ghost out oh you got the holy ghost of his speaking tongues oh you got the holy ghost if you can prophesy oh you got the holy ghost of your faith for the church all of that is good yet all of that is nonsense hmm Nicodemus you're faithful but you must be born again huh people is not hard you said while you're sitting there brother books weren't being born again is just as hard as it was for Mary Mayer said lord I don't know how this thing gonna be but be it unto me according to your word all she had to do is receive it Rahab like I said this morning all we have had to do was receive the spies and she got eternal life he's the same yesterday today forever a pardon is not a pardon except to be received as a party everything has to be received it is a gift it is the gift of God eternal life is a gift of God you don't lack for it but you've gotta learn how to receive it hey that Alright she let me tell you brother there's all these not by shaking of hands and neither about water baptism of sprinkling nor does not stop eating meat or keeping Sabbath day but but by quitting smoking if I quit smoking oh if I stop chewing if I stop drinking if I stop swearing all these things that's not the way into Christ this is up all those things and still be lost it ain't your works it's the grace of God smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey running around with other women unlawfully and all these things that you - that's not sin that's not seeing cursing and swearing and drinking that's not sin that's the attributes of sin mmm what makes you do it but that isn't Searcy that's attributes is of it y'all know what it is right unbelief make you do it somewhere you're not believing who you are you're not where you are you're not recognizing your position in Christ hallelujah is that okay Oh Minister truth that's where people get mixed up the reason you curse smoke drink get angry and fly off the handle things like that is because you are a sinner that's not sin it's because you are you're a sinner jesus said the scripture says he that believeth not is condemned already hello it's not all those things that make your sinner he that believeth not is condemned already you don't need to know how it's going to be done but if you believe it's going to be done you are believer Abraham you won't have a son in roie I don't know how it's going to be done but I believe it's going to be done and the Bible said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God that's where we are I don't care how long it takes God's gonna do it mm-hmm one thing about Joshua he came to know who he was when a man is fighting about and he saw that he needed some extra sunlight to do it he was one of those oddball he's he's a hot dog Sean stand still he didn't say Oh son would you please stand still oh he commanded sunny spoke to it as though he owned it Sun stand still hello he didn't even say all Jehovah help me now he knew his position and when you come to know your position you have the mouth you have the word to come and to speak is that right I'll remember that Mexican baby who had cancer of the mouth and the doctors tried to operate it and and the Prophet God said there ain't a cancer got angry and the baby's mouth and everything swole up even bigger and the prophet of God sitting there you know feeling sorry for the baby and he was waiting on God then the Holy Spirit says but I'm waiting on you see all the time we wait on him sometimes God puts you in a position where you've got to do something he want to see your compassion is that right he said never before as a cross-eyed baby come before me and did not lead them with their eyes straightened why because of his little Sharon rose when she died the pain was so excruciating her eyes cross so what happened God he said it was a training period he didn't understand that God was training him so that when he would come across every cross-eyed baby he could have the compassion and the love to - to it fact that God could use it to heal that child see a lot of time we go through stuff we don't even realize God is doing that he's training you some of the suffering we go through is for other people and not ourselves help me Jesus coming to know who we are like I said we can't keep looking back you know when you look back but let me talk about that he said only frogs was back and he said that's unclean and you and I must understand we can't keep looking back is on the bride it is on the ride and guess what onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus marching on before it is Christ our eyes on him I love the scripture according to Hebrews 4:11 forces by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , what was that we would have never known that King was more like an intellectual he thought whatever his vegetables were his religion was his ability to grow crops his ability to make a pure are beautiful and all he just lined the altar up with them and everything else why could not God accept that because that's not what he required hallelujah God interested in all the ones who do he wasn't one thing from you and that is for you to accept the bloody bleeding lamb the Word of God that was slain before the foundation of the law that's what gets you into the gate this Alea yes we work we work we do what we do because we love God if you love me you'll keep my Commandments hallelujah but I do not work the only time I walked was I labored to enter into his rest but your works don't save you it's good to do it but it doesn't is that right the work was finished the Bible says according Hebrews the works were finished before the foundation of the world so how can your work to do anything when it was all ready to finish we'll finish that Jesus did and we list it when he hung around the causes that it is finished all the works everything was done everything was completed when he says it's finished but in the mind of God when he said that it was before the foundation of the world it is finished and it was finished before the foundation of the world why did you how do you listen people let me say like this in closing when those Old Testament Saints got grace from God where did the grace come from it came from the beginning it came by way of the lamb did and it comes by the way of the lamb now and the prophet of God said they were able to glean from that Oh somebody help me here I'm almost done you love the Lord nineteen wrote Exodus 19 9 and the Lord said unto Moses lo I come to thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear let me before I finish reading this let me let me say remember that John Ryan I think it was John Ryan the blind man right extra extra read all about it he got back in the line several times there brother Brown you told me I was healed and he's in brother and said but I told you said you believe right see to say I believe one thing is that it believers the kind that God is looking for is a revelation something that strikes your heart right then it is done and once it strike your heart then things happens right cuz he said oh I believe brother Adam but it was just only from the air it was an intellectual faith as a prophet God said is that right and so many people have intellectual say God don't can use that he means this thing this dis dis this coming from the heart it must come from there in order for God to respond so to say I believe brother Branham that's not going to get you nowhere no belief is action acting upon the word you have heard belief is acting at least that's the kind that God accepts but this is my last scripture so you understand why we follow a message and a messenger the message is Jesus Christ the messenger is william branham you understand me it's like Moses Moses was the messenger Moses you understand me but the message was God who should I say sent me I am so I err was the spokesman Moses was just the veil of the spokesman so you let me read the scripture so you understand what I'm saying Exodus 19 and 9 says and the Lord said unto Moses lo I come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe thee forever and Moses told the words of the P words of the people unto the Lord you understand me so you've got to understand that God there's another scripture I had and I must have erased it but God put Moses Moses was God's dead right but so when Moses died he tells Joshua Joshua remember all that Moses said because Moses knew that the ways in which he spoke was not his own the word he spoke came from the pillar of fire right and as you heard me say this morning not you some of you heard me say isn't it something how people could quote in the way they did and they approached the word Jesus himself it says Moses said you understand me so they trying to correct the word by what Moses said and that's what people are doing now they're cracking the word oh you say they don't do it yes they do the Prophet God made a mistake and said 700 and the Bible says 7 and people are still saying some of them saying well he knew what he was saying it was 700 did y'all know that people do that how you gonna connect that when the problem of God comes back and said I didn't mean to say that oh I'm just telling you it's the same kind of spirit the same kind of thing amen and we know that the Prophet God's ported us back to this Bible Fuller's right back to the Bible John 5 closing on this scripture you know what I'm not trying to tell people you know not to say brother Branham or anything like that but like I told them even this morning different ones if you're not careful you'll find yourself worshiping him you will anytime you exhort something else or name or something above Jesus name that's worship no other name his name is exalted above every name and you'll never him brother branham preaching Paul said Paul said he preached what Paul said but he never called his name Harley ever why because he understood it when Paul II was Christ it was the anointed word but people don't realize there is a seducing spirit they don't understand an enticing spirit making you feel if you don't do it this way you're wrong that is wrong absolutely not of God John 546 to 47 for had ye believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words he tied it all in is that it's me all along Moses talked about me I'm me now and if you're not gonna believe me you didn't believe Moses it is what it is and I look at people I said what is wrong with folks don't y'all understand if you really had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost said that that this Holy Ghost would be a witness of Jesus but jesus said the Holy Ghost were witness of me nobody else and when they call old Paul and Paul me they worship Paul Paul says wait a minute he said yeah I know some of y'all would have given me your very eyes you worship me you you you you you allowed you came you saw me as Jesus Christ himself and Paul had to correct that spirit I said wait a minute I didn't die for nobody but now you want to baptize in my name see that was the new cheat that's in the New Testament people gave Paul that way and they did william branham the same way and they're still doing it and paul corrected it then and so therefore it needs correcting now it is what it is Paul said if you do that you make me an antichrist William Branham said if you do that you make him an antichrist see what people don't know their position they given Eloisa and then get me wrong I respect my prophet I love my prophet I thank God for him but only one that shed his blood for me with Jesus Christ and if I go any other way with that I become Antichrist y'all understand me he wasn't there he he you said what what do you mean only the Bible says none was worthy to loose the book loose the seals he's that right they said oh you're no brother brother laid his hand on me brother branham healed me and then brother Browne said I ain't never healed nobody that's what he said go read your message he said I'd never heal nobody is that right that's what jesus said jesus said I've never healed nobody that's what he said read your Bible Jesus said I know he'll nobody it was him whatever I saw the father dude that which I did here the - is that right brother Brando stood there on the stage and he saw that pillar fire moving he said that one over there sister so-and-so see it wasn't only him it was Jesus Christ doing that and what the man you and I never gave Oh Lord you know this is what make them work wrong because they said in Matthew says Lord have not we cast out devils what man you know can cast out a devil they taking God's credit they've taken his glory have not we cast out Devils in your name they're taking his glory he's here depart from me ye workers of iniquity you knew better you know you ain't got no power to cast out Devils let's stand it takes the Holy Spirit to do that hallelujah I know all y'all sleep the entire cuz I am too but thank God for the word of God even it's kind of warm in here too so that kind of adds to it I'll never forget my brother Chris Hall was preaching me for me that time I got so sleep in the pulpit folks I pulled my shoes off I took the tie off I took my jacket off he said I started to look over there and ask you did you want a pillow hey that sleeping spirit it when they jumped on you you can't help it brother it's just whether you can shake and I know what y'all be going through cuz I've been there myself and I am NOT laughing at nobody cuz I know the feeling just trying to comfort you I really appreciate your coming I really appreciate everybody being here and enduring because sometimes you know the the Spirit is willing in the flesh Amazing Grace she'll always be much must be mad [Music] just so

not the understand he's all about the good guy there are people in this message but they can not that's one of the elements that he says he said they cannot live it they can't produce that divine love see that's what you look for you look at character don't look at just somebody's give who they can say and he breathes and pray ah that ain't nothing is character they must produce the carrier of Christ when you see the character of Christ guess what you want to be near it you wanna be close by you love that atmosphere but you get a man who's lifted up and proud and haunting you don't want to be round there and there's a lot of preachers you say brother Luke you better leave those preachers alone I said Lord you know I'm not speaking they get dignities you know what I'm trying to say I'm trying to say I'm trying to warn us I'm trying to say listen work on yourself let God work on you you produce the character that this message is calling for let God produce that character and you suffer go what you got to go through don't watch everybody else look at you right can I say like this just like sour little crude but when you in the shower you bathing and washing yourself like you there and you making sure you get every area you supposed to get that's what I'm talking about take this word and bathing let the Holy Spirit wash you inside out clean up everything if you let him like I said you got to receive you gotta let him though he's your brother's I don't know why I let him in then I fall short again it's ok get up that's what it's all about he gives us grace so we can
