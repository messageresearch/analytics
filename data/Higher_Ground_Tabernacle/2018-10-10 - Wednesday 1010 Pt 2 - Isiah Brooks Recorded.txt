TRANSCRIPT
========================================
bread the bread wheat die you live by their substance therefore if it takes dead substance to make us live physically how much more did it take depth so we could live spiritually forever something had to die so therefore we could think that those who think that water baptism say that's that's out those who think that good works saves or law that's out it takes death that you might live Christ died and the Bible said to you to know him is life not to know him but to know him the person is life the other died every one of us if you see yourself living Lord kill me know what this must die Oh even the heathens know that that if something must die Dahlia that's why they have human sacrifices in places they knew human whatever you know which is even know that their kill something just to bring a curse a curse to life but why would Christians see i'ma tell you I know y'all want to tell you some folks I know one thing the tree of knowledge and good and evil will be done away with there's only one tree at the end and that's the Tree of Life two trees in the garden the garden the tree of dollars of good and evil and the tree of life at the end in the book of Revelation there's only one tree that lives and that's the Tree of Life so you can't get to heaven amen with having the tree of knowledge and good and evil yah yo the seed cannot be mixed it has to be a pure seed and that seed is what God put in you that's why it must die brother Brown said even the foolish virgin had potential but they never brought the seed to life same material the great of all gives his life you understand me I want to live I don't want to die I know that this old Tabernacle was shared but after this shared I don't want to go down I want to go up I want to live among the living you understand me and I know that the only way I can do that is that I must die you see that I'm saying that you know what y'all might this I'm seeing something that I don't know how to bring it but I'm trying my best to bring it because I do know one thing that there are places in my life that needs to die and right I wanted to die in rot take me there Lord Jesus take me there what good is to have all of this and miss heaven well good to know that you existed and you had a time or place in life where you could have had inherited eternal life and be like uh some some some messenger right Jared's messenger we need the messenger to tell Jesus you know to mean what good is that looking God right in the face what good is it to look this message right in the face and not be willing to do what it's asking you to do when I thought better than life what could be better than life so life has two meanings one of it one of its people call life today it's not life but its death many people think that sin drinking gambling writ reveling they call that life either that's the truth you know I've had mothers and fathers who literally stopped their children from coming to church because they say if you come and you get into that message you're gonna miss out on life oh you're missing out on death I can't help but to think of the torment that those parents are gonna have if when they realize their influence it may cause their sons and daughters amen to miss life cuz everybody gonna die one way or the other you go down here to one of the honky Thompson tonight and you can see them dancing and the young ladies and young men of this beautiful city you can hear them screaming and dancing and drinking and they say oh we are living you're mistaken you're dying is that right and you know that's true you know you see these women Amen and insta truth but in my day in my town in my city only prostitutes wore makeup only prostitutes died they're different colors it's the truth the clothes that they're wearing me now that's what signified that's what that's why you knew what a prostitute well by the way she dressed cuz she will always have dress they have dress no more brother Mike then they kid and people don't even realize Amen that if that Holy Ghost is not in your soul I didn't say your spirit because there's a lot of Pentecostal people who have the Holy Ghost on their spirit they can preach they are nurtured they can prophesy they can have visions and dreams and all of these things but they have never been born in the soul and the Bible said that soul that sinneth not your spirit the soul that sinneth shall surely die and this message is the only message that takes you behind the veil most people don't even know what you're talking about when you say behind the veil you know this message thank God for it when it looks like you know we we you know we've fewer all the time and number the numbers and decreasing look among us people who could come to church don't come ah it's on the spirit if it was in the soul they'll be driven hallelujah it was in the soul I mean you can't happen to come something drives you to church even when you're tired and don't feel like it something makes you come Wow that's that soul and that soul needs to be fed and that soul knows that he grows by hearing the word brother been said the Holy Ghost has a feed on the word that kind of life couldn't be what David was talking about uh because that life gets to Mirabal till min takes a pistol and puts it at their head and blow their brains out with that kind of life men climb to the highest story in their hotel rooms up there with living with men and drinking and holding their hands and jump to their death with what kind of life to lead right so David could not Ben have meant a meaning our meaning that kind of life so it's got a perverted you see it's a perverted life then if that kind of life isn't right then what is the right kind of life thy loving-kindness is better than better to me than life just to know that God's loving-kindness y'all understand me it means more to me if I gotta be that's who I want to talk with I want to talk with Lazarus when I get there that one that was at the rich man table I need to talk to him see everybody else want to talk to everybody else I want to talk to that one why because the Bible says never I seen the righteous forsaken nor seed begging bread and we find that this Lazarus who was literally a servant of the Lord was there trying to get the crumbs from the rich man table but no Devils the devil said you can't be here because he's written hallelujah but that never knew he has far who is far the world every because he and he held on the faith even though circumstances look really grim for him he may have become a laughingstock how can you say you're a Christian you see God does what he wants to do Lazarus was put there for the rich man it was the rich man test not Lazarus a man that rich man had a second chance and he steals all hallelujah amen he lost one chance when he wouldn't follow Jesus and he lost a second chance when he wouldn't feed Lazarus but Jesus said even if you give a righteous man in the name of huh you'd get a righteous reward so all he had to do was feed Lazarus and we would have made it to heaven but because he missed the second chance he found that in his third time there was no way of escape a preacher in hell that's what he was brother and said God called him to preach and he'd rather have his riches ooh a lot of preachers hallelujah is this okay just give me a few more minutes please well surely God is good to us huh you know in this life sometimes circumstances are hard right now I think all of us are going through some hardships so hard times and you know you wonder why you know I mean it's like we don't understand a lot of things I just know and God doesn't have to give us an answer for it if you choose to give us an answer the reason that it's okay but at the end of the day we will better understand that by-and-by because I do sometimes I wonder what this is all about and why you know did I cause this or whatever the case may be but you know I heard a message today brother Brent says you know a lot of things that we suffer it's because of generational things that has been passed down to you and God allows it hello he allows it I mean if he gives if he gives you the faith to overcome it you will overcome it but if he doesn't give you the faith is his will you said what do you mean because faith come by God God has a purpose for every one of our lives right remember ladies brother element down at berm Tabernacle who was in a wheelchair almost all a lot she died that way she had faith but it just wasn't the will of God for her to get up and guess what God used her as a testimony because she constantly praise God and gave him thanks and glory regardless to her situation right you think love the Lord now let me say like this and I'm a hurry up because I don't wanna be too much longer but what you think about brother Branham when he were talking about this slave who came over here on the ship you know a lot of slaves you know they were jumped ship because they didn't want to be enslaved they will actually commit suicide before they got here because they knew it in some hearts and minds it was better to be dead than to be enslaved so anyway the ones who made it over you don't remember the story about the the king's son I thought about that I thought about that cuz I got some sons a falling in my image I mean they were one day but they not following me now you understand me they're not they're not for all brother dad is a preaching he's trying to live right before God I'm gonna think i'ma go no but here was a king son but it was a blood in that man that made him where he was hallelujah honestly it was a blood this cuz y'all know that that's true sometimes preachers if you've become they have preachers after preachers at the preacher in families one after another after another another because that gene that gene keeps popping up for the purpose of God but then you know you think about a king son you know you got those who who follow remember go through the Bible and see how many king's sons really followed their daddy and did a good job not too many most of all most Devils right it's true I mean and you think about it that that God had to take Solomon you know brother brother Troy preached only the other day about the sons and everything you know Absalon and all of them want to be king right but you know it wasn't for them it was for Solomon right so you look at it you saw what do you mean brother Brooks this boy was a king's son and it doesn't say whether this that the King had any other songs but one thing about this son he was to be king and he knew it he knew he had keep royal blood right so he acted the life that was in his daddy was now in him y'all hear him saying when the life of God comes in you you become a king and so wherever you are you conduct yourself as a king what are you in your kingdom a lot you are a king does anybody recognize you or not you are king David was a king and many people did not recognize him as a king but he still was a king hmm and so what happens you see when you really got the Holy Ghost God don't have to whip you into shape god don't have to make you do nothing the king's blood is in you not my weird lord but thine be done the king blood is in you you can't help but act like him or talk like him and walk like him and do the things that a king doesn't what he did it would do right they said let me buy this man no do you feel better know he has number and his conditions were no better than anyone else and sometimes we feel like well because I'm a Christian maybe my condition supposed to be better all the time they're not why because that's not where virtue is is it's created and built fine living you know to me and you might have fine living but don't think you're gonna be exempt from trials tests gonna come you understand me there'll be times you you you might me have money but you might not have joy which one is more important that's all I'm saying and when it comes to life you and I must understand by God's grace because you are to be built and because you are creature of God being created you must go through the fire hallelujah and understand this fire is not to destroy you this fire is to build you it is making you it is coming to a place and I don't care I always tell God and in my prayer whatever it takes that so that you could be reflected in me so do it lord I give you my will that your will be done this is okay I'm gonna give you one more example cuz 8:38 here so did you understand that God III just can't help but to think the Queen of Sheba and I said this the other day I think about her how she three months journey three months in a desert you know you had the Ishmaelites and all of them their Arabian Nights murderers and thieves and everything else and she just heard of the revival and she packed up everything she left everything her country her people everything I'm going to see because I have worshipped all of these idols I have been to this church and dead organization and disorganization and I haven't seen a move of God yet so but now I hear that there's a move of God over there in Israel and I'm going and he says she she you know brother said she actually packed gold and silver and everything she had and said if I over there and it would be true I'm gonna I'm gonna fund it with everything I got but that contrary to a lot of people in the message because what happens when they come to the message they want the message to make them rich instead of giving they want to receive y'all don't may not know what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about see I want you to understand when God's real fit with real faith strikes you and you really see who you are no matter what the storm and tests yeah they're gonna be moments you know I don't believe that David was really thrilled and happy you know when he was facing death many times on when he was in a horrible pit and all of the us I love David you know it's just because he knew how to express himself he talked and he said what was from the heart he didn't hide nothing you know once he learned that less and everything was open and free so you understand by God's grace amen he's the kind of man I like you know I mean and but but you got to understand that in all of this you and I must know that God will never let you go and God will never let you live substandard you gonna come up whether you like it or not right it's like I tell my grandkids you know I've got one that don't like to put his clothes on he want you to put them on and he's too old for that I told him yesterday I said if we have any more trouble out of you I won't thank you I used a word whoop needless to say he was fully dressed this morning when I got up I don't know whether his mama helped him she might help cheat but she knew I meant what I said because sometimes it man this flesh you got to beat this thing sometimes this is a Moo did y'all know that it has the nature of a mule it don't want to get up with me get up yeah everything it don't and pray when you want to pray it don't work you don't want to praise God when you know you out - this is um you you can let that new hole you down if you want to you better bottle that thing but anyway let me say it like this the faith that we have is not an intellectual faith it must be a divine revelation of Jesus Christ to you that takes sin out of the heart see saying can't come out until the revelation of Jesus Christ comes in into a lake let your faith is not enough that's alright but it's only brings you to the Holy Ghost see but it let me say I'm sorry the Holy Ghost is a personal experience of the birth the new birth regeneration making a new creature in Christ name I stop there because I want you to understand that our lives and I'll be here Sunday so I'll pick up where I left off here I won't you understand that our lives must must be formed it must be transformed you must you and I we must be transformed we cannot continue to have the high the mind that we have now and expect to go to heaven huh this mind this mind the spiritual mind of our must be transformed it must be renewed renewed why renewed mind right it must be washed by the water of the word let this mind be in you see he ain't gonna make you have it he ain't gonna make you do it you got to let it let it you must yield to this you must feel I'm a seal that's the only way it's gonna happen guard I'm gonna force it but it's your will like he did with Jesus Jesus knew he was to be the sacrifice but God still gave him a wheel he never took his will away he had to give it away and in order for you to be successful at God that lived the life that we livin now we must give our will to God lest an brother well said the outward expression shows exactly what's in the inside beautiful you can't judge me I got him in my heart if that be the case you need him all over you that's the way is that you've got to bring him on out come on that's what people say you can't judge me I don't have to the word saying so what's that song wrong okay okay but you know what anything any time you come up and you got a song when I'm done you sing it we have a that'll help us out you welcome to do that run because you said you play some nice songs if I don't know it I don't wanna stop the anointing you know when God put that on your heart something like that but God is so good to us let's pray here father God we come before you know if as humbly as we know how Lord we so thank you for your goodness the life we live it's not life unless you are the leading it goes back to what Paul said it's not our that live but Christ that lives in us father truly how do we know when you hear you're given us senses you've given us faith we say a man to your word because your word says where two or three are gathered in your name you were there father help us father we all need help here sometimes we come in the way we come in it's a dishonor to your Lord in the Old Testament it was against the Kings order many people were killed because they had a sad countenance in the presence of the king lord please help us forgive us a lot of our sins forgive us Lord God when we come in here I'm not recognizing your presence it's more than feeling is faith and faith has no feeling we know you here we know you come we know that your you deserve and lord help us learn how to wash your feet in the presence of all the critics help us to surrender they yield to you Lord in spite of other conditions let us press through the crowd let us press through all the unbelief in in different spirits Lord God help us tonight bring a change in our lives revive our souls I need a revival Lord bring the revival Jesus washes and cleanse us and fill us and fires up Lord recharge us there would be a few of us Lord God we desire Lord to be true worshipers and the only way we can truly perfectly

are not so expressive Lord in their worship give us grace Lord break destroy the yokes Lord this is we want you in those of us who can Lord I pray father that we are worshiping enough to provoke others to worship you don't have to feel it Lord it's just what is this me it is it's just honor its honor Lord honor you let us honor you whether we feel it enough Lord let us honor you in your presence granted Lord strengthen us lord help us to be what we should be Lord I fall short myself sometimes I come in and and in so while before I even get into worship because it seemed like there's a wall of some sort but lord please help me be steadfast if I gotta elbow my way through their atmosphere to make that connection with you I'm so happy I'm so happy I got so happy I'm so happy oh
