TRANSCRIPT
========================================
imagine you have a child Amen but Sarah was in the same position Bible says she was well stricken in age oh yes she bore us on the neighbor him Amen because God did exactly what God said that you would do a man lets her to Psalm 103 amen they were an expectation God said he would do something and lo and behold they waited for it and God did exactly what he said he would do Psalms 103 first through the fourth verses it says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns with tender mert with loving-kindness and tender mercies amen I'm gonna read that verse one more time who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowd the with loving-kindness and tender mercies a malicious bow our heads before Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for redeeming our life from destruction Lord I remember Laura back in the time Laura when my life was headed for destruction Lord and how you came down into the room Lord you swept down into the place father and you redeemed me you you took me from the path of destruction that I was on and you redeem Eve you set me on this new path father you changed my life Laura and now my soul says bless the Lord O my soul I remember all that you've done for me bless the Lord and forget not all of his benefits Lord you've changed me from the person that I once was and you've redeemed me father and called me by your own name or this I thank you Lord we all think it we all rejoice you Father did we remember what you've done for us and always let's say this morning father would come to the house of correction Lord Lord if we have anything in our lives it's contrary to what you would have for us Lord we just say Lord right now we surrender ourselves before you Lord traitor you change us rebuke us if you have to lord make us into your image Lord whatever it is Lord we're here your service father do it seems good in your sight father for we are waiting on thee in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you can be see it a man that a poor soundboard back there the knobs are loose and they come off and you go and put in one position and you ends up being in a different position and it's not easy soundboard to run and then like driving an old model T when you're used to driving up a Ford Hey Amen let's uh let's um like I said service this morning title the message expectation Amen we've we've all got expectations in life a man we all have things have been promised us we have things that we think life will go this way if we do this and we just come to have an expectation about things you know if you have a job you you you have an expectation you have a paycheck every week you know we've just come to the trust and those paychecks amen if we ever got a job where they say well we'll pay you this month and we might not pay it for another six months and then you just never know what to expect that'd be a a hard way to be when a person's used to paying their monthly bills on time because you have use use of an expect or expectation of a paycheck every month you know it's just something we we some people become so reliant on that paycheck you know you always skits are wondering boy what would happen if these paychecks quit coming in you know what would happen if all sudden you know you went a month or two or three or four without a paycheck what would happen you know and you as the bills to start coming in you know you but you know we have an expectation of these paychecks you know and that's just an unnatural thing you know but in a supernatural way God has said I will take care of you a man I will meet you all your needs amen as the Lord is taking care of the sparrow and you know the sparrow doesn't have to worry about this worry about that but says I have fed the sparrow a menu as the the flowers of the field they do not worry about what kind of clothing they're gonna put on by God himself has given them they were clothing God has given us pair with our food and so God also watches over us amen and so even more than our earthly paychecks we have grown into expectation that God will take care of a man we might lose our job tomorrow we might lose our job next week you know we might get to a place where we can never work again but one thing we do know for sure is we know that God we have an expectation that God will take care of us amen God will watch over us amen he is the God that he he says there in Psalms 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name Amen bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits amen we owe we ought to be in a place where remember what our God has done for us hey man remember what he's capable of I mean he can't be in a proper expectation of somebody until you know what they're capable of doing Amen you know we look at our companies we work for we know we're know they're capable of paying us every week so that's why we have great faith in them but even more so with God we know that our God is able to able to you know if we get in a like when we first became Christians you know I think just about everybody and you're in here if we became Christians we didn't come here become a Christian just because it sounded like a neat thing to do we even become Christians just because we thought maybe we'd get along there in life but we became Christians because at some point in our life God some point in our life we were shaking down to our the very core of our be Amen there there came a point in our life to where we could no longer do things for ourselves like you can normally expect a man alone everybody has a if you've become a Christian at some point in your life you became there because at some point in your life you were shaking in your mind Amen you're shaking in your thoughts you were your shaking down to the very core of your being there was there's something in your life that caused you to realize that you need something greater than yourself amen you need it you needed help from someone greater than you could help yourself you know is the longer you go in life the more disappointments in life that you have the more you begin to realize do you need something greater than yourself amen you know when you're when you're young and you maybe know I had too many experiences in life you know you first begin to learn to trust Lord as you you know as a teenager you know you have all the emotions of life and all the disappointments all the depressions and different things and and you know you learn to trust the Lord in that and sure enough the Lord brings you through the own you gained here or the early early 20s you know you have an expectation you you want to start a family you want to get married and have a husband or a wife and then that brings a whole new set of challenges in life amen you begin to learn to trust Lord with that once you begin to have that expectation you see you see God bring you through this stage of life and then he brings you through the next stage of life then is your children get older you know and you be in you know if they your child's first sickness you know the first time they have a cough or they're struggling to breathe and you start worrying or they have a some rash that covers their entire body or something you know yeah and you know the the sickness comes already you're like oh Lord what do I do and young God brings them through a man if you've ever seen God come into your house and heal one of your children you know it's like amen what because you begin to have an expectation when God when you see God take care of that thing then they just raise your faith a little bit higher amen going as you get longer and long in life you know as you you're a husband or wife you know and you and you get to the point where maybe you disappoint your spouse or you become disappointed in your other spouse you know one displaying one with the other and you have to come down and kind of reset your marriage all over again you know you just come to a place where you've done something to get the other person or you've allowed yourself to grow cold one toward the other and you kind of have to hit the reset button and get down at the altar and shake yourself all over again and then also you begin to realize that God the coolest the sweetness of his presence comes back and restores the whole situation all over again and brings a restoration then he began to realize what God has capable of these are the benefits of being a Christian a man because he'll never let you get too far a man he never lets you get too far away from him I mean but he brings you back to a place of restoration amen and when you come to that place you begin to realize when you realize oh my the Lord wouldn't let me get too far the Lord wouldn't let me go this way or he wouldn't let me go he'll let you go so far off the path and the east sets is like he's just sets his angel right there and he stops you he says you don't want to go this way my child you don't want to go that way and then God brings you right back to the path he restores you so you can come back all over again say bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits bless the Lord O my soul a man why because he is he is is what he forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies amen I think back to my own childhood you know it you know what I think I probably told my story to most people you know but you know I went through large pressure when I was growing up you know and and I went through a lot of things and I decide at one point that I was gonna grow up and be a homeless wonder you know and that's that's why I wanted to be in life I want to just go you know ride the trains or do ever it is you live in the woods that's why I decide I wanted to be in life you know but in the midst of all my depression God came down and changed you know when I got so low in my life God came down and revealed himself to me and he won't know why I look at this word I looked at the Bible and cire looking through I was like Lord I see how you've dealt with every Coble character I see how you how you were there for Saint Paul I see how you were there for Elijah I see how you were there for every single one of them for for Jonah Lorna or for Sampson every single one of them when they got to a certain point God you were there for them a man I'd like it to be Lord that I could have the same experience in my own life that I can know that without a doubt that that when I need you you'll be there for me amen and you know what God has met me in that way amen I had a desire that whatever the Bible characters experienced in their life I wanted to have the same experience hey man and God brought me this message to show me that way a man that I could do that the Bible days are not over amen they're not the you know it's not just god of two thousand years ago a man but we're serving a god right now amen and there's still Bible characters living on this earth a man and those Bible characters are you it's me a man and we're no different than the Sampson's and the Jonah's and Elijah's and the Mary's and the Martha's a man why because we're still living in Bible days and God is still here answering prayers and doing things like he decide in the Bible you know a brother Branham when he started his when he started his meetings back in the 1930s and 40s way before the tapes he had an old truck and he painted on the side of that truck Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he started his ministry on that he ended his ministry on that that Christ is the same that no matter what you go through in this life journey you can always be sure - one thing that Christ will be the same amen all of us ought to stand on that rock that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he will not change amen he is the same Amen that when we have a need of something on life's journey we have an expectation that God will meet us I mean if you get to a place where you throw your you've cool it off towards God you've you've gotten to a place where you don't know what to do here don't know what to do there you can always come right back to Calvary you can always come right back to Calvary right here and sit here for a while and God will have mercy on you and come back and meet you all over again Amen you can never get too far where there isn't a reset button you can push on this and come right back to where Christ is and meet him again all over at the cross amen amen just like Sarah found out when she was 90 years old who read there in Genesis God remembered me amen think about this she was at the end of her journey she's nine years old God has met her and given her the thing that she's looked for all of her life amen now she's seeing God do all kinds of things she had seen God do all kinds of things in her life she had lots of little things they had need but they had one thing that they had been looking for consoling that was a son and they've been waved that thing for 25 years a man while God had answered a lot of their prayers he had give taking care of their needs they lived in a dry desert land yeah God faithfully met all those needs but there was still one thing there's always on the back of their mind is when is God going to meet this promise when is God gonna meet this promise but they waited and they waited in the way and one time and finally after a while after 25 years God came through and met their expectation a man the same thing is with us we all have an expectation you we might see God do so many things in our life so you know we might see God heal this or heal that or do this little thing here a little thing there but we all have an expectation of of walking step by step with God we all have an expectation where we would have a desire that we won't be led by the Holy Spirit of God to be led by the Holy Ghost amen is no matter how much God does for us and this part of our life or over in this part of her life but we always serve we'll never be satisfied until we can say of a surety that we know that God that our footsteps are being ordered of the Lord that we're walking day by day with God that we're walking day by day we know that God is ordering everything one of our steps that we can wake up in the morning and know that we can hear his voice Amen that we can wake up in the morning and say what would you like to do today Lord because we are looking for that walk with God amen and none of us will be satisfied until we could you know as much as as good if it is for God to meet us here in the service as good as it is for God to answer a prayer to give us a new job or to do those things that none of it compares to when God meets us on our day by day walk with Him amen and that's what Calvary is done for us how Christ died that we might have that walk farm amen amen let's turn over to Psalms 143 hey man we come to the house of correction every every day so that or every week all right well why we come to the house of correction why so we can be changed from the what if there be anything in our life that's contrary to what God had for us that we can be changed you know when Christ died on the cross he had in his mind he had something in his mind now remember Christ is a creator he created the heavens and the earth amen and he had something in his mind when he died on Calvary he had something in his mind he had a purpose for which he was dying on Calvary for a man he wasn't just dying there for no reason he had a reason that he died therefore he died there so that you and me that we could have life and have it more abundantly he said amen and that life is not just any old life that's his own life but how we preached last week on the book of life crying Jesus Christ God himself wrote a book called life amen he is the author of it but when you open up that book you know is like like we said last week and you know any man when he writes a book he puts has in mind he has something that he wants to have inside that book he writes a book because he has something in mind amen and he has a he has a story that he wants to express he wants to express the glory of wherever is in his mind he wants to get down on paper so that it can be expressed to the others a man once said getting once someone opens up that book and they look down on the inside then that whatever is on the inside of the book and begin to be expressed to other people amen and so that after reading the book that whoever reads the book can have the same thing in their mind that the author had Amen and yo you know anybody that's a good reader you know yeah it's like me when I read a book I'm not seeing the words on the page I'm watching a movie in my mind you know what because when you get into a book it's no longer just the words on the page but you're you're in ear transported into a world where you're not just seeing the words on the page anymore but you're just watching a movie in your mind you're you're seeing the experience you know you know if you've ever watched watched a movie that was based upon a book you read the book first and then then when you watch the movie like let's know what that character is supposed to look like or that's not the way it's supposed to go because in your mind this is how this is how I saw in my mind you know Amen but God wrote a book called life and if there's anybody they ought to know what life is all about it's God amen he is the author of life he knows what life is all about a man so when God wrote a book called life and when you open up but it doesn't have big flowery language for this long story read through it you open a book and it all has its names in there the only thing in the book of life is names but when the author of life went to write the book of life instead of writing all these big fancy stories he just started writing names these names are gonna describe my life on the earth and he got down he started writing you know Adam and Abel and Moses you know he kept writing Elijah and Samson and Joshua Joseph all these names are describing the life of God on down through history and when you read the testimonies you II you know like when Jesus came and died on the cross you say oh my here you begin to realize that you know Joseph was a type of Christ he began to realize that Jonah was a type of Christ he Owens like well how did they do that how did they type out Christ how did Joseph get sold for thirty pieces of silver how did he how did he do it did he have in his mind that he wanted to act out something that you know God was making that man he was typing out life he was his name Joseph's name was on the book of life how did how did it get soul into the prison and have the butler on the right hand and the baker on the ran by Christ on the cross had the thief on the right and the thief on the left how did he do that his name was on the book of life and he was expressing God's story God's story through his own life amen how did how did Jonah go down into the belly of the whale three days and three how did he own Jonah here he thought he is what he is like imagine Jonah going to bed every night why am I such a disobedient prophet why am I such a disobedient man you know God says to go do this and I go do that God tells me to go down to go down to Nineveh and I go down to Tarshish instead and he be kicking himself you know there on the boat why am I so disobedient why do I keep doing this why do I keep doing that but yet all along God was using his life to write the story of God and again when and when Jonah got thrown overboard with his hands behind tied behind his back that God prepared a special fish compass swallow and he went down to the bottom of the sea for three days and three nights and Jesus self and said the Son of Man will be in the belly of the earth for three days and three nights just like Jonah was in the belly of the fish a managed ona he thought he was in the midst of the word his worst disobedience he thought he completely ruined the plan of God he thought he had completely ruined God's plan for his life he thought he completely destroyed everything that God had called him think about his Jonah as a young man as the presence of Laura come upon him and he a prophesy and he of the presence of Laura come I need prophesy he began to realize that God had chosen him and his ego on be always struggle with this disobedience seeking why is that when God says go do this I would go do that and he will gut yet God called him nonetheless and there he when God says I need you to go around and in avoid he instead he walks and goes and takes the boat to Tarsus he's kicking himself all on why am I doing this why am I doing this being all along God had a purpose all along God in the midst of the most of his missile is most disobedient act God was allowing him to type out the most obedient thing they'll ever be done on the earth that Christ would go to Calvary think about it it right in the myths of Jonah's disobedience he is typing out the most obedient thing ever done on the earth well who wrote this who wrote the script who wrote the script God Almighty a man who wrote the script for your life amen be as we have been written on the same book Amen the same book we're describing the life of Christ amen and we all have you know we all have our had our disappointments in life we've all had things that we wish we hadn't had done and sometimes you know it takes our breath away the the foolish things that we've done on this life you know and when God has constantly called us and called us and called us and and we look at the death he did on the cross where he died for us and then we look at our own disappointments in life and our own things that we've done in like Oh Lord you know I should have done this you called me to do this he and I went and did this being all that that God is still has said but I will not leave you nor forsake you Amen my mercies and my you're my loving kindness and my tender mercies will never leave you nor forsake you amen why because God has chosen us he says I your your you will describe the life of Christ on this earth it's already been written when God calls a man he fills with His Holy Ghost he has this that man is going to fulfill the life of Christ on this earth amen so whenever God starts pulling on your heart when God first starts tugging at you when God first starts drawing you what's God doing he's testifying I got your name written upon the Lamb's Book of Life why is God tugging you why is God calling you because he wants to express his own life through you on this earth amen and when when you when when you first get in it what it sets you in an expectation Amen that the same experiences that the same experiences that Jonah went through the same experiences that Elijah went through the same experiences that all the Old Testament Saints went through now it's our turn to go through the same experiences why because we're testifying in the same life amen amen amen it's just like in Hebrews chapter 11 you read through though they were they were they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being all along they are testifying they had God leading them to us we won't even know it's like just like jesus said that in the last at the judgement time that that and many will come that Jesus say that when I was sick you took care of me when I was in prison you came and visited me and the bride heard the Bride of Christ will rise up and say when did we ever do that when did we ever do this we don't remember that he said but God the Holy Spirit was leading them to do this they didn't remember doing it they didn't do it out of but just all sudden God put the thought on their mind and they went and did it and then they forgot about it but God God's Holy Spirit was walking through them leading them guiding them why is it everyday you submit yourself to the Holy Ghost and when you get up there all sudden you begin to realize that all along that you were doing the will of God all along and didn't realize it Amen that's how the bride is we always think oh I wish I could do these great big and mighty things but if you just day by day submit yourself to the Holy Spirit amen it pays off at the end amen it pays off at the end amen Psalms 143 amen verse 4 it says therefore is my spirit overwhelmed with in me the heart within me is desolate I remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works I mused on the works of thy hands I stretched forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land now David here he was in a bad spot he was in a bad place you know verse 3 there he says my enemy has persecuted my soul is smitten my life down to the ground he has made me to dwell in darkness as those who have been long dead what he said my spirit within me is overwhelmed David was in a bad spot well there's one thing about David is that he knew that whenever he got to this spot he knew exactly where to go whatever David got this low he knew where to go he went to God Almighty he went to the throne he went to the altar and he went and he prayed before God because he knew if I can just get to the quiet before the Lord God will hear my prayer Daten one thing about David's he knew the power of prayer he knew if I could just get to that place to where God will hear me that all problems will be taken care of he was an expectation he knew how to be an expectation before God when he got so trouble in his mind when he got so distraught so so so dismayed when he got so low he knew that he could turn to the Lord and his expectation is the guy will meet him amen now let's look at this verse 7 through 11 here look at the first two words of each verse hear me cause me deliver me teach me quicken me this is here David's going through remember David's in prayer here he's using he's in prayer what's he's in a bad spot he needs God to show up on the scene he needs God to come back was he he needs a revival in his life he's gotten he's gotten so low in his life he's God has show up on the scene so he say he says verse 7 hear me speedily O Lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest I be like them to go down to the pit but first he needs God to hear spirit he needs a some type of assurance in his life that God is gonna hear his prayer be like Lord I know you always hear me but Lord remind me all over again that you will hear my prayer he was in a bad place amen his spirit failed me what verse 8 says caused me to hear thy loving-kindness in the morning for indeed do I trust cause me to know the way where and I should walk before I lift my soul under thee what's he doing he's at the altar Lord I want you to hear my prayer Laura cause me a man caused me to hear your loving-kindness cause me to know we're in a walk oh he want I want he's entering into communion with God a man I'm laying my life upon the altar I'm putting my soul right here Lord remember me cause me verse 9 says deliver me O Lord for mine enemies for I flee unto thee to hide me amen amen this man need deliverance he got to a place where he needed some deliverance hey man what was he doing he's laying at the altar Lord deliver me I've gotten to the place where I can't do it for myself anymore or I need you right now a man is was he doing he's laying himself upon the altar he's not going off over over here for help he's not going off over here for help you say Lord I'm coming right here to your altar I'm coming right here where I've met you before I've gotten so low Lord I need you right now lord I know you deliver me O Lord for mine enemies verse 10 teach me to do thy will for Thou are my god what's he doing he's trying to restore his life back to a right walk with God amen teach me to do that I will Lord I've been doing my own will for too long Lord I've been doing my will for too long Lord teach me Lord to do your will Lord I want to stop right here I've been going this way for too long I want to go I've been going this way if too long Lord I'm stopping right here Lord everything just stops right now Lord Lord I won't teach me Lord to do your will set me on your path Lord I want to go in the way that you have provided I I've tried my way for too long Lord and it's just it's ruin my life Lord and Lord I want you to but I want you to write your life on the inside of me Lord so what verse 11 quicken me O Lord o my now he's coming down to the end of it the end of the request quick and me O Lord for thy name's sake for thy righteous snake bring my soul up out of trouble amen now he wants the final the final answer bring him bring my soul up out of this pit set me up out of the deep miry clay set my feet up I've been down here for too long Lord Lord I've been I've been depressed for too long I've been down for too long I've it's been too long since I've heard from you it's been too long since I've had your presence come into the room it's been too long since I've been face to face with you in prayer Lord quickened me make my life new again Lord revive me in the midst of the days quick and me Lord for your name's sake for my for your righteousness sake bring my soul out of the trouble amen what's he doing he wants this sould be to be revived once more a minutes what Calvary has done for us so we can be like Sara when Sara finally got the answer to her prayer she finally got the life that she was looking for 25 years of looking for that life she finally got that answer of life restore amen and people will go year after year without the life of God down the inside even if they come to church or they read their Bible or they pray but they don't have that life on the inside but there's got to come a time to where what God wrote down in the book she comes to excretes in your life that whatever God Christ had in his mind for you on Calvary actually has to come to a place where that comes to comes to fruition in your life there's got to remember you know Christ had something in his mind for you on Calvary when Jesus Christ was dying on the cross he had you in his mind and he had your life in his mind and he died that you might express his life on the earth therefore he has a walk waiting for you amen he has something waiting for you to do he has a walk waiting for that you might be quickened by his Holy Ghost so you cannot walk your waste but you can walk in his ways a man so you can no longer walk in your sins me you can walk in his righteousness amen Jesus Christ has a walk for you he has a walk waiting for you amen and and all all the all of heaven and earth is waiting for you to experience that walk but you can't do it until you first die to yourself at the altar amen until you first go through these steps like David did hear he said hear me cause me deliver me teach me then finally quickened me make me alive again amen just like we say you know Lord I repent of my sins Lord I've been baptized into your name or fill me with your life then I can go teach others your ways then I can now I've been watching my sins now I can go bring healing to others now I can go let's turn over to Isaiah chapter 60 like we read the other day Isaiah s Isaiah 60:1 Jesus quoted this here remember Jesus went to the synagogue he opened up the scroll and all the Sadducees and the Pharisees the Jews were watching him to see what he'd say and he opens up to this verse right here in the Old Testament he starts reading from Psalm 661 he says the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted he hath to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord Jesus Christ stood here on the earth crying out in the midst of the church those words and you know what the thing was he didn't just say it he did it amen there are people they were brokenhearted they had their hearts bound up hey man there are those that were in prison that were found themselves set free amen there were those that were there were there were there were meek and lowly and he and he rose them up they had the gospel preached to him amen so now in our day all of us have been called to fulfill these same scriptures we all ought to be able to if we're if we call ourselves a Christian we'll be able to stand up and say the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me amen he has anointed me to preach the gospel amen he has known only me to preach the gospel to the court to the meek to the lonely Amen he has caused me to bind up the brokenhearted amen he didn't call us to be brokenhearted he called us to bind up those that were brokenhearted amen so if you find yourself on this life's journey brokenhearted remember a Christ didn't call you to be like that when he said when he is dying on the cross he didn't see you as being brokenhearted Amen he didn't see you as being bound up he didn't see you as being in prison he didn't see you as being bound by your sins Amen he saw you alive and living a life by the full of the Holy Ghost that's what Christ saw on Calvary that's what He died for amen if we fall short of that then we got to go back to Calgary to meet him there amen because that's where he died for us to fulfill that a man so if you missed that mark then just come right back to Calvary he is waiting right there Amy he's waiting right there for you to come down off your high horse he's waiting for you right there to come back to Calvary all over again so you can repent of your sins all over again and you can be filled with the the fulfillment of what Christ meant for you to do on this earth a man because God didn't call us to be lukewarm God didn't call us to be brokenhearted he didn't call us to be bound up and in prison he didn't call us to have bad habits a man he didn't call us to have things we couldn't get set free from a man he didn't call us to to be bound up by our dirty habits or things like that he cost me set free from all those things and he's waiting at Calvary for us to lay those things down a man of God ever called you oh one time then he is still waiting at Calvary for you right now amen if ever one time he called you then he is still waiting because this is still the day of grace amen if we haven't stumbled too far a man if he if you're here in this church God called you here for a reason amen but if your hair in this church God placed you here for a purpose a man he's waiting for you to fulfill that purpose hey man but until you have the Holy Spirit walking in inside of you and you're walking in step by step by spirit you cannot fulfill that purpose but Christ is waiting at Calvary for all of us amen when we get out of the way amen amen just like Jonah I can imagine them saying every day oh why am I like this why am I like that but you know you know the there is an arrestee thing about the judgment you know we know that there's going to be a judgment some day a meant one day some day there's gonna the books will be open amen and all will be gathered together up up up in heaven and the books will be having it open and the judgment will be set and the Bible says that the word is going to judge the earth by Baal says christ is going to judge the earth the bible says the father is going to judge the world well the bible also says that the Bride of Christ is going to judge the world so now with all this this judgment going on now first off the word is going to judge the world how much how many things in this world are contrary to what the word says there's a lot of judgment that needs to go on amen there's a lot of judgment that's going to happen this world is in for a rude awakening when when all of a sudden everybody's caught up to explain themselves for how they have dealt with this word of God that God has given us amen how many times has this Bible been taken in and someone has read the scripture and someone's been healed or delivered or some miracle or sign and wonder has happened on the earth all those things are done for signs and wonders when brother branham's sit up on the stage and he'd say you over there in the red shirt you were just praying and you were praying for your brother that's over in Minnesota that he would be healed from his cancer well now who told brother Branham that how did that happen God was making a sign in wonder in our day in the midst of a lukewarm day God is making a sign in wonder so that we will be without excuse and why are we in this church why because we saw that sign in wonder and we said that's right that's true God is the same yesterday today and forever and we saw the message of brother Branham we saw that Street one brother Bantu he came to bring back the word to open it up so that somebody could could walk step in step with this word that's what the message is for that's what we were here for we're here to walk step in step with the revealed word for our hour and if we miss that we miss everything amen amen so what so what so what's the message of brother Branham here to do for us it's to come line us up exactly with what the Word of God why so we can escape the judgment that's coming upon the earth Amen judgment is coming upon the earth amen so so when judgment is set the Bride of Christ will be there now why is the Bride of Christ on the right side of the judgment because she's already been judged she's already placed all of her sins underneath the blood of Christ amen they're underneath the mercy seat she's she's taking her sins she said Lord I repent of my sins lord she's judged her sins right there right here right now now is the time of salvation now is the time of repentance and so she taking all of her sins that she's repenting of him Lord forgive me Lord forgive me like we do every day Laura forgive me I shouldn't have done this I should have done that and we're taking our sins we're taking our shortcomings we're placing them underneath the blood a man we're keeping the way clean so we can be without spot without Rico amen and we keep doing that over and over again now it's not that we're supernatural it's not that we have the super flesh that is not tempered all the septum tations all of us have weaknesses all of us have these things that we stomachs like we stumble into but Ron said our flesh is sticky a man it's just like a sheep you know a sheep as the stickiest fur of any other creature practically birds and everything it's hard to keep a sheep clean it's hard keeping us cheap clean but God has a way of keeping the Sheep clean amen because a sheep is sticky you know everything will collect into that but God has a way of keeping the Sheep clean and what is he doing you bring you will bring her there he will bring her there without spot without wrinkle amen and so and so when the judgment is set and we're sitting with God in his throne we don't have to go through the judgment again we have already bypassed the judgment Amen we don't have to we don't have to be judged again because we've already our sins have already been judged hey man we don't have to go through the judgment again a man so so now so now when when all of all at the white throne judgment everybody's coming up to be judged I hear we are sitting with Christ and just strong and though as the word is open you know and someone comes up and says you know I just couldn't live for your Lord I tried but I just couldn't do it and glory could look her over a member of his bride right there and say you know you went through the same thing when you were on the earth how did you overcome that and the bride will say I just trusted in you and you provided the power I couldn't overcome the thing I tried I tried and finally I just turned it over to God and you delivered me by your power by your mercy and your grace and the person standing there that the white throne doesn't believe without excuse because the Bride of Christ will be standing right there and she will have gone through every temptation every single trial every single temptation as is common to the earth you know you go through as you know as I've traveled I've I have met people who have gone through all manner of temptation you know those tell you different testimonies and things that they've gone through and and there's people there members of the Brian Christ have gone through some wicked stuff they've been through some hard times amen they've been weak in the flesh they've done things I shouldn't have done be at God and His mercy and His grace has reached down and grabbed them amen remember we were talking about the we broke down the word loving-kindness amen loving kindness the word loving-kindness as he said there in Psalms 103 that he crowns us with loving-kindness and tender mercies and the word loving-kindness to me is like a man that goes to someone that's lower than him and picks him up and raises them up and considers him an equal side by side with him he is the flesh of his flesh bone with their bone maybe he puts his arm around him and considers them an equal that's what God is loving kindness has reached down in the sin the muck and the mire has grabbed us pull this up he's put his arm around him he's watched us he's cleansed us he's forgiven us of our sins he's baptized us in his name he's fills with His Holy Ghost amen that's crowning us with his loving-kindness he's placed us on the same Saint stay with him you know it's like we say you know a horse marries a horse a cow are you both you know but but who does God marry if God has a bride he can only marry a god a man so he's picked us up and he's put his own life inside of us amen amen in the tender mercies you know as we said the tender mercies was had to do with like as a as a woman that was pregnant with a child would caress her her belly you know that word has to do with caress see the tender mercies the same thoughts that a woman would have towards her unborn child that love that she'd have that's the same love that God crowns us with a man has tender mercies a man that's the same thing that God has towards us how did how did we escape the judgment because we submit ourselves underneath his loving kindness and his tender mercies amen and he forgave us of our sins amen all manner of sin they'll be in the Bride of Christ we'll be taken care of amen why because we came to the house of correction amen amen a David he knew how to pray amen wash me cleanse me he's always constantly whenever his enemies start getting the best of him he'd always find himself right back at the altar Lord deliver me and the Lord Lord delivered him and delivered him and delivered him delivered every single time and now we here are been written on the same book of life that he's been written on we can experience the same thing that he experienced a time after time God has delivered us and delivered us and delivered us the the habits of life the things are too hard for us to get away from God has set us free why because he came to set the captives free man a man he didn't come that we should be bound year after year after year no he came so we can lay these things down and be set free amen because he didn't call us to be carnal amen amen that's what Calvary did for us Amen if we miss that we got to come right back to Calvary amen amen he's waiting for you there amen amen Mary and Joseph you know and when Mary had to go and tell Joseph as she was with child you know how can I get how can I get Joseph to believe me leave the story and as Joseph as he had to consider you know what am I going to do this woman that I was going to get married to his has a child and I want to believe her story but I just you know how how can I really believe the story how can this really be true and and and you know I can just imagine all the thoughts going through his mind where he he wanted to believe her but he but he just couldn't seem to bring himself to believe what she was telling about the angel that came and visited her and told her that she would be with the son called Jesus and he just couldn't seem to grasp it couldn't seem to grab ahold of it and so what do God in His mercy God and his tender mercies came down and revealed it to him right there but it's hey was spoke to him and said don't you fear to take Mary to me why but he was gonna put the word was being born inside America he was gonna put the word away he was gonna shot right when he isn't getting ready to reject the word God and His mercy came down and had him accept the word right when he was getting ready to reject the word God had in his mercy came down and received the word amens the same thing for us God is always waiting if you ever get off the off the line off over here off over there that God and his tender mercies will come down and stop you right there amen yes probably what he's doing right now amen because this is the house of correction amen amen wherever you find yourself out of the way just come right back here to Calvary he's waiting for you right here amen he's waiting for you right there he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen amen why because he had something in his mind when he died for us at Calvary so we gotta go back to Calvary to get locking step with whatever he had in his mind for us to fulfill a man because we don't want to miss what he had in life for us amen amen I think it of the brother singing this morning you know you know you can't sing a song until you've gone through something you know and nobody can ever really sing a song until you've been through something you know once you've been through something then you can sing a song about it you know as you as we you know I've preached several times about the the hymns that we sing you know when we sing just a closer walk with thee you know well you gotta go through something to need to want that first of all you have to have had a walk with them in the first place to desire walk with them amen amen and you have to be missing some part of that walk to be a yearning down on the inside to want you to desire more of that but just as much as there is a yearning and a desire for a closer walk with God that means that if there's a deep call for that and there's got to be a deep response for it Amen just because just just the mere fact that you're desiring that closer walk with God means that God has a closer walk for you amen amen no we're seeing a Isle enter into his gates with Thanksgiving I will enter into his courts with praise that means he has some gates for a stager into a man he has some the courts of the holiest place for us to enter he has something for eternity and he don't have to enter in downcast he has a joy free to train with him amen I will enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise amen either is going to be a meeting in the air and the sweet sweet by-and-by there's good there's a meeting here for us amen sometimes I think about you have to shake yourself and remind yourself of the ages that we're living in God sent us a problem how many generations have had a prophet Sentinel how many generations didn't get a prophet you know but God in His mercy sent a prophet to us in this age and what'd he do he point us right back to Christ and plain revealed Christ all over again so we didn't have to live in the dry dentists of this denomination we'd have to live live a Lutheran Church walk we didn't have to live a Catholic Church walk we didn't have to live a Pentecostal Church walk we didn't have to live a Methodist Church walk but we got to live with Christ amen we get to live with Christ amen and what and now that message has got come and gone now 50 years what does that mean that means we're at the end time amen we're at the end time a prophet like that cannot come without something coming right after amen something has to happen amen Israel's back in their homeland amen she's surrounded by enemies all around you know the Bible says the ones days that Jerusalem being compass we're roundabout with enemies amen and that everybody will hate her Amen I just read the other day that that uh there the the Muslim countries were proposing getting together a joint army there they pull all their armies together they say we got 51 Muslim countries here or how every country is there and they each have their own army if we pool our resources together we could wipe the Israel off the face of the earth that's fulfillment of prophecy you know and it's going to happen they're gonna try it but they won't succeed Amen why because it's also been written in the word that they will not succeed amen we're living at the end time as prophesied in the last days that Israel will go back to their homeland waiting for the Messiah and she's done I now it's been 70 years since that's happened and we were still living in the last days a member right on the right on the cusp of who's coming one of these days the Bride of Christ will disappear off the face of the earth it won't be long three and a half years after that Christ will come back to the earth if the rapture happens today and that means in the year 2022 and all the over we're living right here at the end right here this is don't know don't get lukewarm don't know cool off for now if you've cooled off and come right back to Calvary amen because we're living at the end I mean if you've allowed yourself to cool off to the gospel come back to Calvary amen amen and renew your vows to Christ amen because that's what we're here for Amen I don't anyone be too long this morning but let's just stand amen Psalms 143 he said hear me cause me deliver me teach me and quicken me a man we all want to be delivered we all wanna be quickened amen amen let's just power hasn't word prayer Heavenly Father I just pray for the folks here underneath the sound of my voice lord if there be anybody here lord has found themselves not on the path Lord that you you who are deign for him Lord somehow they've cooled off towards your gospel Lord there were some how they
