========================================

year um I'll just sing this song God will make this trial a blessing and all me if you can put that on the screen mm-hmm because as the Christian life all of us must go through a trial we must be tested and he takes two mountains to make a valley and that's why Paul said count it all joy when we take ten tempted because he knew that God the reason why God put us in many trials is also we can look around in see the mountains that's around full of blessings and also I just want to sing this song maybe they'll help somebody [Music] [Music] [Music] I've just call me to eval you well like I've

didn't want to sing the last first because I thought that first didn't apply to me because many of us when we go through a trial or a test of God wants us to speak to victory before the victory outcomes so this verse says um now I'm standing on a mountain looking back I can see when I was in the lowest Valley his strong hand was leading me oh it's good to see the sunshine to taste and the sweet victory our God has made this trial a blessing all the grace he gives me and I was like well my trial is not over yet so I can't sing this song but then in the in the chorus she says there is no need to talk defeat so just keep talking to victory God want us to talk to Victor before he happens so I'll sing this last first [Music] I can't see his strong hand was leading me it's good to see the sunshine answers this sweet baby god man-made astride a blessing all the crazy maybe try their blessing though he sends me to my ear though ideas for like the river didn't leave their sweets relieved there's no need to get needs courage there's no need to top the beach God will make this trial a blessing and the whole world make these try the blessing though he sends me to my though my tears fall

[Music] [Music] [Music] now he time for the Word of God [Music] brother Frankie and all that he do and all of you who helped us young people's meeting go forth we really appreciate you all without you

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] I thank God for the songs that have been sung that song that I brother eats this Paul saying this morning the old favorite of mine by the tidwell's I used to play that song over and over and over again because I know that every trial I've ever had God has made it a blessing God is faithful and I appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ thank God for our sister Naomi took a little courage a lot of courage to get up and sing when you're not expecting her sing and I really appreciate her going forth like that it's a beautiful song all the participants in men I still marvel at our brother Samuel he's a little package but he's got a lot of volume I appreciate that I just appreciate all of you I don't even know what to say but before I get started I want to say something to all of you young people cause right now I'm moving up in age and I'd like to see something happen among you I mean real fire not not the traditional thing that you perhaps have seen but I know when when it comes to the top trial trials were getting ready to face you go to bleed more than just understanding of the message in your head it's got to be in your heart and and you young people that do those of you who are in school you really have battles I know you do and you're gonna need more you said well why are you saying that because even when I was in high school I saw young people who belong to a similar church apostolic at that time we didn't know the message but I saw them cave under pressure and even though I wasn't a Christian I knew that what I was looking at what they were reflecting was not what they were supposed to reflect and I used to feel sorry for him but at the same time they wanted to be like me who was I was a sin at a time and I wanted to be like them so you got to realize there's always somebody watching you and if you're reflecting the right kind of thing they really do want to be like you they may not be able to express it with their words but remember that someday when they get ready to see God they'll remember you because you you're the one that they looked at as being a standard as a Christian you're the ones that they did see living a life that they could not live so when they come to that time and they want to live it I'm telling you right now there's a there's a young man I'm trusting he made it more than one person but when I was in high school I saw him stand for Jesus he'd read his Bible a man during lunch time he didn't care who watched him the young man was a very handsome man he could have gotten any girl in the school and he was to himself studying his word taking the abuse people talking about him because he would dress out in jail but that young man was something I saw and wanted to be and when my time came I remembered him and during my time I thought here it is I have a greater message than what he had he was able to stand under what he stand with what he had the Lord let me stand with what I have now as we stand we no matter how young you are people people are looking and people are thirsty brother Branham said the world is dying for love they're dying for it everybody want to love everybody won't love and the Christians are the people who's supposed to be packaged let's turn by God's grace I've got so much to say and I wanted to do so much I don't want to over over bear or be overbearing today but so many things were said even in the songs that goes along with the message that I will have preached today acts 11 please acts 11 thank God for all of you who have come up from Iowa City it's a real blessing to me that you did come I just I just know what I've seen and I know what could what can happen I know I see I see a group of young people that I know and believe that God will not set a fire and I know he'll do it if you'll allow him to sometimes it's not when you want it it just comes when he has already designated but just like the prophet of God said if there's a deep call there's a deep to respond you just got to wait keep calling he will respond acts 11:19 now they which were scattered abroad upon the person upon the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene II which when they were come to Antioch spake unto the Grecians preaching the Lord Jesus and the hand of the Lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent to sent forth barnabas that he that he should go as far as any other who then when he came and had seen the grace of God was glad and exhorted them all that they were with purpose of heart they would scream unto the Lord out that that's what I'm saying that love thought purpose of hard that they would cleave unto the Lord for he was a good man and he was full of the Holy Ghost and a faith and much people were added unto the Lord let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for being real so real and our soul you changed this man from what he was to what he is now and father you're still changing us from glory to glory we pray that you would bless this message in a special way and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray you may be seated because we have a various range of Ages here this morning I may be acting a little different at times but my point is that I want everybody to enjoy the world okay my subject this morning would be a Christian is a believer right so the strength of a Christian it's what's inside of him the strength of a Christian is what's inside of him or the thing that is inside of him just quoting here for a moment so you understand where I'm going the Prophet said a sheep is not asked to bear war he's not asked to manufacture some world this year if he's a sheep he'll have wool because he's a sheep he don't have to say well I'm believing I'm a sheep so I believe better get hurry up around here I got to get some wool for the master he don't have to worry about that as long as he's a sheep he a bear would you don't have to manufacture it now you don't have to manufacture sell a coyote and I've got to have some I should do this and I know I'm a Christian old brother trying to save itself by itself by its own human efforts yet sincere and that's what happened to a lot of Christians or people who have not come to the place where they're born again they try to bear wool when they haven't been born a sheep yet a sheep is it is what it is it doesn't have to go to school to learn to be one it is what it is and we know sheep doesn't manufacture a bear wool it comes from the inside out what's the matter is wheat pulpits weak schools weak seminaries that's the matter teaching man's theology you see today the strength of a Christian you see are your Christian oh I'm a Methodist or you're Christian or I'm a Baptist you know are you're Christian oh I'm I'm in the message all right as if that has anything to do with you being a Christian you must know Jesus for yourself how different hallelujah how different from the first church they had goal of these things to say but they had been filled with an energy I like that word energy I like to see people with energy because in this day it seemed like everybody's tired but I love to see people with energy because they have something to offer and if you tired and somebody's has energy you're gonna either get energy are you to get out of the presence of that energy they have energy a power of the Holy Ghost that has set them free from sin and death and they wasn't normal it wasn't normal nominal excuse me they had a love of God burning in their hearts that sent them to death y'all know what I'm saying see when I read these things it's what I crave for you know what I hear the word of God and I see it I measure myself by that word and I said God that's where I want to be I want to be that that that original it ought to be a copy I want to be the original whatever they had is what I want I'm not gonna stop until I get it all right I'm not a social drinker so you understand what I mean I like getting drunk in the Lord and a Christian he's a believer you know it is you take this Bible and the message how you want to place it and you say I believe it all now let me ask you a question do you understand all of this be honest no but you believe it all and you believe that all of this is God's Word and you believe that whatever God has said there's no error in this Bible God has made himself he's manifested it I was talking about somebody the other day and they said well you know the property of God said that Enoch Noah saw Enoch translate and I'm saying this to the young people so you understand that according to the chronology you know the time of living knowing Enoch live in a different time so how did Noah see you Enoch leave and the Lord I asked God let me tell you something when you don't you have a question about this Bible you asked the Lord and God will always give you an answer because somebody is gonna come in question you own that right you know what the Lord told me he said Noah was a prophet and so he did see Enoch is that right then he took me to the Bible and he said my Moses how are you gonna believe this Moses wasn't at the creation but Moses wrote at all hallelujah you see what I'm saying people with their ridiculous questions all you gotta do is ask God when you ever have a question about the word in the message ask God and he'll give you the answer why because it comes by revelation he put things in the Bible to stumble those who are so intellectual walk reasoning we don't reason the word we believe the word the strength of the Christian is having confidence in God and God is the word Yanis 10 as long as you stay on the word hallelujah you don't have to worry about failure right a Christian according to dictionary or whatever says it is a person who exemplifies in his or hers life the teaching of Christ right he died he died in other words he'd used an expression he died like a true Christian and we remember but remember now the Bible tells us and I didn't continue that Scripture but I would go head-on in acts 2 2050 with only says then departed but Barnabas to Tarsus to seat song and when he had found him he brought him onto an ark and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch and understand they were called Christians because they walk like him they talk like him they lived like him and the miracles followed them see you said I am a believer the Bible says miracles signs and wonders shall follow the believer hallelujah so you know when you see these things you got to understand that as a Christian somebody's gonna confront you and they're gonna ask you all you say you're a Christian what make you a Christian right you think you better and that's what they say you think you better than everybody else right now those things the Bible says those who live godly in Jesus will suffer persecution so you can't get around that because God is gonna put you in a into what we call a confrontation you're going to be challenged right you're going to be challenged and you know you say well brother books what do you mean yes God loves those opportunities to prove himself not only to you but to the to thee to the non-believer right so you got to realize by God's grace when it comes to being a real Christian it is what's in you now if you don't put nothing in you there's nothing that will come out everybody so when the squeeze come well when the squeeze come if you if there's nothing in you when you squeeze nothing's gonna come out it's like an orange that deceives you you ever had one of those sweet-smelling nice-looking orange you squeeze if you can't get no juice out of it you know anyway that's how some Christians are but nevertheless the Bible tells us in Philippians 120 and 2930 says for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake she being a Christian doesn't mean it's a flowery babies everything lovely and wonderful no suffering comes with being a Christian now the truth of the matters are oh this one is a Christian this one is a Christian this one is a Christian but if you live knowing that you have the truth if you live according to the Word of God that God has given us a corner Malikov you're going to be persecuted from we're Christians those who call themselves Christians they are going to persecute you and you must have a ready answer you must have something to give back other than words there must be a light behind what you're speaking is that right because really let's let's just for an example Daniel Daniel not only did he and this is what makes me happy this is I understand Daniel little bit now I'm not a prophet but I like the idea because Daniel was a man that stood alone though Shadrach Meshach and Abednego was there somehow you never see them in the same church meetings somehow they were always separated and Daniel had to pray he had a prayer meeting and nobody showed up but Daniel but did he stop Oh ain't nobody coming so I might as well stop praying uh uh Daniel prayed anyhow you see what I'm saying he has stamina he had energy he had something on the inside of him that made him live amen y'all know what I'm saying he was not ashamed like Paul said of this gospel Paul said I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ it is the power of God unto salvation hallelujah having the same conflicts which he saw in me and now he now here's to be in me now you got to understand Paul says I've gone through everything never was I've been shipwrecked I've been beaten I've been there three times raised up and everything else that process and I get up and I still glorify God how did we go through these little light affliction huh they sent the wrong thing to me oh you know what I mean these are light afflictions we can't be so we just so soft jelly may God have mercy we need some backbone folks oh my you got to understand these Christians were talking about y'all Noah corn is a corn if it's a real high power real thoroughbred corn you know what I mean it's real right anything that real is ugly it's the truth everything's happen is beautiful is that right think about it you go and you see your orange and it's orange in it that's not a real orange it just looked like one seedless oranges y'all know we like those but that's not real it's hybrid it's true and and and the scientist has designed it so well it's so beautiful oh and y'all know we like the seedless grapes come on somebody it's beautiful it's sweet it's tasty but it will not give you life its man's system that has made it look like that but life has a different way of expressing itself is that right but a man who even tells us he said you know a thoroughbred plant don't need to be watered all the time and when you get a person and they've got to be watered all the time and encourage all the time and come on come on come on eventually when you stop encouraging them they're gonna stop so you got to realize as a Christian you have to learn how to be strong even in times of adversities when there's no one else around that's when you stand that's when God is working with you right because he want to see how you stand on the pressure by yourself is that right Paul had to do it Paul said listen he was the greatest a messenger of his agent you know he did a lot of witnessing he he opened up a lot of churches and and everything else and at the end of the day Paul says I'm standing alone God even took my best friend Dimas one of my best friends and now Dimas is gone and now all of the preachers are standing against me where are all these churches that I once had he says I'm by myself he's able to know what I fought a good fight and I kept the same and we've got the fight folks you can't give up it's too late to give up it's too late to be distracted you know all these things that's flowing around the message keep your eyes on Jesus don't let these things all they're doing this and they doing that that has nothing to do with you this is an individual walk keep your eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah let God be able to bring some rule out of you you know what I'm saying so you realize by God's grace Christians who were or not they were you know it's like this they were afraid sometimes people are afraid to stand for the truth and I'm giving you to give you an example in the word in Galatians 6 chapter 11 through 15 of this okay I'm not gonna be long you see how Lord you said ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand this is Paul writing to the Galatians as many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ you see what I'm saying there's a Jewish law that every man child at eight they had to be circumcised and when the Gentiles came in they were circumcised and they weren't being commanded to circumcise and so the Jewish people had men tried to put this law on the on the Gentiles that they need to be circumcised and that they knew the truth because Paul would not have been rebuking them in this situation he said no you're doing this and it's only because you want to look good in the eyes of the people but we know that's right Paul said the Galatians have got heaven who will be with you that you would go back to the law when the law all it did was present death to you you couldn't do it you couldn't live it yourself and now you're trying to make the Gentiles he said you are busy you have been bewitched right in other words when you go backwards when you know to go forward you have been bewitched and it goes on and he says now but god forbid that I should glory right save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ this is Paul being Jew to the first church he said I'm not glory in nothing but in the Lord Jesus Christ but whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision y'all gonna hear what I'm sayin your morals mean nothing but a new creature because there's a lot of people in the world who don't steal smoke lie or cheat but you must be born again you must become a new creature in Christ and this is what I'm trying to get over to the people do you realize the millions of people who follow the message of Moses and yet they never got the new spirit only two out of that generation and that's what scares me that's what troubles me that's what makes me sigh and cry because I realized there's so many people who are resting upon their religion like the Sadducees and the fantasy Pharisees did and when Jesus came he said you all all y'all dead young it looks out on sometime I feel like I'm selling rough and I don't mean to but I do care about souls you do not those of us who understand and know you do not want to die amen without the blood covering you you want the blood covering you now dreams are dreams years ago I had a dream and this person was talking to me and in this dream he took me to the three levels of Hell and one level of Hell I saw children I said God children just yes we're not their children in North Day we're not their children in Sodom day you understand me whether or not their children in Egypt right so you said well what about a child coming to know when a child comes to understand good and evil that's when God will hold him accountable it used to be 12 but nowadays these kids know stuff without mercy and you and I must understand Amen that we know that the blood has saved everyone that has been predestinated to be safe now look at this because I want you to understand and I caught this by listening to the message but anyway you know we we find out listen he says you know every time something is going good Satan always brings something to mess it up right you can have a church and his own fire for God I'm telling you this because when God starts to fire and he will he's going to bring it because I'm praying I'm believing and I'm expecting right and when God starts something and it goes good guess what the devil always bring somebody in to mess it up but the Branham called it sheep stealing dogs I'm like yeah hey it's the truth sheep stealing dogs and we got a lot of around here I said around here I mean the message people who will let you work they my first my first split in my church in in in Ohio which came from befriending another brother from another I guess a segment of the message and he took all my babies all my little babies I just warned to the Lord preaching on the streets and everything else he took my right they never recovered even though God gave me a dream of their destruction I tried to warn them they went on anyway but you see what I'm saying when it was going good that's when the devil came in so I'm saying when it started going good brothers if I'm still here by God's grace that I mean he's alive if I start preaching hard on about the sheep stealing dogs you know when I'm talking you understand me so let's move on see the devil that's the way the devil will do it right but it takes stamina right it takes a man of God or saint of God to actually see the enemy approaching and stop him right God is faithful you must realize what is your inheritance and you must protect each other you understand me all of us in here which should protect each other we should never discuss or speak evil or try to down one another even though we may not may not agree with things we should always be positive each other try to unify listen you got to fight this what Paul said fight - can you got to contend for the faith you're the fight and it's important that you have this in you is a strength because sometimes people can run somebody down and it takes a strength for you to stand against them y'all know what I'm saying it takes us because sometimes this person may not maybe you know a relative or a great friend or something and and and and it takes strength to say hold up you don't need to be saying those things do anybody know what I'm talking about that's the way it's supposed to be that's the way it should be because those are those are things that we allow to infiltrate it deplete displeases the Holy Ghost it grieves him because only one thing that that blesses God is that when we are on one Accord now let me hurry up on this I love this one thing I love about is you know sham God and many of us don't I mean we know about him but sham God to me he represents that old Christian that you know he was just timid and you know I thought I knew what that word timid meant but it means lacking in self assurance lacking and courage or bravery easily alarmed shy you see them saying you know sometimes when it comes to God we're not supposed to be timid you'll never see a soldier warrior timid he's a fighter and he knows he's a fighter he knows what he's packing and you and I supposed to know what we're packing the devil listen when safety comes and say this is what's going to happen you're supposed to call him down and says you are liar when you just be people speaking to curse you or say something negative about who you are and what you're going to become you're supposed to stop that because you realize that's not God talking that's the devil you know young people I'm gonna tell you something you can make straight A's and school if you want to don't you ever let those teachers tell you what you cannot accomplish when God said all things are possible that means if I want to a I can get one whatever I want I can get it even my son who who gave rededicated his life two years ago and he's been trying to live just as close to God as he can and you know he called me today this morning even telling me how God has changed in him and stuff for the good he thinking something's wrong with him but God is cleaning him up but the thing that he was telling me is that that that that these people are discussing or making him the head security person over that whole company Netflix yeah he just got that news he says you are you serious he would be in charge of everybody over that and you know he's been keeping himself he's you know saying in opposition in the under the pressure he said daddy I'm so different he said I am so different around uh uh all these people I said you know God made you that way but you know what he did he said to me he said daddy he said ever since I've been faithful and paying my tithing and reading and studying he said God been good to me God will be good to you under pressure I love this because sham god I love sham heart because he didn't have much to fight with he didn't have much to fight with you know it's almost like all I had was this thick and and to be honest with you if all y'all would want to jump me with the stick and I'm anointed by God you're in trouble because somewhere somehow the skills will come from and that's the way it was when sham God Amen he didn't know how to fight he didn't go train he didn't take you gypsy he didn't take karate he knew nothing about warfare but he got angry he got mad at the devil and sometimes we need to get mad at him right don't act like the devil your friend he's not your friend the Bible said he comes to steal kill and destroy hallelujah and the devil to make you split up with your best friend over junk sometimes when people say things to you it is good not to even respond that's the truth follow peace with all men holiness without no man should see the Lord share God said I am so tired how many y'all have had it will seem like the devil just all in your pocketbook no matter what you to you can't save you can't keep no money there like he's all and you don't even know where it disappeared to somewhere you need to get tired especially if you paying your tithing God said if you pay your tithe you open up a window where you wouldn't have ruler somewhere Amen those Philistines is in there every time you think you got a good chunk he comes yo know the truth a car break down something happens right and you need to get mad at it don't just think over will this is going to happen no you are in a warfare understand Satan is working against you - what to diminish or deplete your faith hallelujah to make you lose confidence in God you gotta put a stop to it you like that guy brother said that song you know he can't speak negative I don't care what Valley we in we got to speak positive right we've got to say Amen like Abraham call those things that be not as though they were become Abraham 25 years knew he was going to have a baby but it didn't come until 25 years he never changed his tune no matter what he went through he kept going with it that's the strength of a Christian it's what's in you see if it's just in your head it's not gonna work it has to be in your heart right in your heart and when people come up negative and tell you all these kind of things it what good is that how many times you've seen the weatherman say it's gonna rain or snow and it never does you know I call them false prophets right so you gotta understand Shamgar desi listen he only had was a weather was a little law of the goat call it arctic oh yeah with a little stick with the metal piece on it right and and you know the kind when the ox don't want to go you hit him with that thing it had a little sharp part on the end right and it made him go sometime God has to use the flipping those thing they get us moving forward but at the same time you must understand he used that same instrument and he whooped those Philistines and he killed 600 Oulu yeah I just wonder sometimes you know you want to go back and see how it's all happening right you want to see how minutes ha oh I he stacked him through you know - by 200 by 200 or 100 but he just by the time he's finished I can see his wife back you don't have said she was in shock he was just man who's probably never raised his voice you know never show any kind of frustration I don't know but there was a new man she saw hallelujah yeah that's a real story that's a real situation Halon to look at and to see how God did what he did and if God can do it for gem god he can do it for you this is what we must understand this book is for you it's for us that we gain faith and trust in God that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changed now we can't allow our minds to cheat us from this reality Lord if it ain't in my heart put it in my heart put it in my heart so I can speak this thing and believe when I'm speaking right Paul was a man of God was a mighty man of God under persecution and I I love the way Paul would do things he really stood as a Christian a man and you got to understand this man was a very intellectual man and he said that listen I get rid of all of this that I might gain Christ and you and I must understand in order for us to see this message the way it's supposed to be seen you got to get rid of everything is that right remember when the Prophet God he tells of a story about this man who painted a pitch of Christ and our statue of Christ and and when he made the statue of Christ as one man observed and he was disappointed because he had heard so many things about this particular statue and he was so discouraged about it he until the one man who was who was mining or keeping everything up he's assert he said you'll never see the reality of what this picture is all about until you get down on your knees see that's what I'm saying young people you'll never see Jesus - you humble yourself do you be able to get down on your knees and not be ashamed of Christ and when he got down on his knees he hit was that the image that he was looking at was breathtaking breathtaking right because he's never seen Christ he never seen Jesus like that and until this message becomes breathtaking until you see Jesus in that way you still too high you got to come down this is why I said tell people I say you know I know people I doesn't matter what they think but my point is until we get to a place where we forget about the great ones and see the great one we're not going nowhere you think that Jesus is Jesus a he's waiting on us but everything has to come back to his proper order in order for him to take a bride that's why it's gonna be a few I know it's just like oh so many people in the message know they might be in the message but how many the message is in how many are this message is in that's the way he said it he said you ought to say the message is in me and not that I'm in the message the pall under pressure let me hurry up all under pressure when he came before Agrippa and then I like to grip the word grip Agrippa grip I looked at word up it means one who causes great pain at birth so I thought about that I said you got to understand that Paul was continually growing into perfection coming into his ministry constantly moving forward so there were things he had to be birthed into and sometimes when you go through chain trials God is birthing you into a virtue it's painful but you can't say oh I'm just oh you know Christians you have a lot of stormy days right it's the truth you go shuffle friction you gonna suffer you're gonna go through but my point is if you're gonna suffer suffering for Jesus suffer because always you know if you're gonna get fired you get fired for being too holy when they don't want you around cuz you ain't you ain't immoral then that that's a real testimony but a grip of Paul says listen and I thought this is why God used that very name of gripper because Paul under that birth he said listen King I want to tell you my story this is what I love about it see when people challenge you they said well how do you know you a Christian give them a testimony let them know where you came from where you were and where you are now Paul says listen I know God is real because he talked to me out of the light he spoke to me when nobody else heard his voice I heard his voice right and you know Festus say you know Festus ease and listen Paul you sound like you man so you got to understand when you really start talking about the supernatural to those who claim to be Christians they gonna think you are crazy I was just at a restaurant the other day and I was trying to tell this lady who tried to get me into her Christian program her daddy started some years ago and but anyway I was trying to tell him about a miracle that took place you know she was talking about different things and I just cut it off I say you know the Lord did ba ba ba ba ba dum he said well miracles do happen that's all she could say because she perhaps never seen one right but I'm the greatest miracle ever if you said I have never seen a miracle you're not even saying you're the greatest miracle ever tell me how God changed you and change your desires from what you used to have into what you are now only God can do that right I don't need to see a miracle with someone else when God has done this great thing with me y'all have no idea I'm so glad that all my sins are under the blood I'm so glad it's under the blood because you would have know oh you probably have me as a preacher you know and that's the way wait you know God does things like he do things like that like Moses you know I always often wonder how many y'all would have joined Moses Church seeing that he was a murderer how many y'all would have followed David you understand me knowing that David committed adultery know how many y'all understand me but God's God god never left him he's still in the book he said I'm saying that's why you had to be led by the Spirit of God now Paul said who should separate see when when Paul comes to a place he says who should separate me from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness peril or sword and I thought this song good this is a good song when I walk into the valley what I've never been before I keep searching for a way out it seemed like the apparent locks on the door how many of you been there y'all young people you it's coming you got it it's coming when you're trying to find a way out of it like this door is locked no way to get out but understand god will make the way out you see what I'm saying is like Moses you know how I'm gonna get out of this situation amen Pharaoh's coming here the widow the seeds behind me the mountains there way to run Lord ha I'm gonna get out and God says stand still and that's what God will do young people he'll bring you to a place where you just got to trust him you have no choice that's where he really wants you the strength your strength is inside it's not in your head is in your heart because when all of this is gone and y'all know it's gonna go when the squeeze come on some of us won't be able to see each other nor connect with each other what you gonna do then that's what I try to tell people y'all don't understand how close this thing is this could happen next year or this coming year with the new elections and everything we don't know how it's going to swing we don't know and this thing can all happen overnight like in Russia and all these other when when people go to sleeping in the next one and they wake up and tanks running down their streets my men one man's decision and you don't have no idea that this thing can happen to you and when it happens where you gonna go who do you turn to in those times of troubles there's got to be a Jesus Christ in your life he's got to be real he's got to be more than what mama daddy said he was you got to know who he is you have to know this is why I keep moving the way I'm moving and telling you I'm trying says Lord give these young people not just wrong but the elders should have been here too they need a thirst too don't look at these old people they're discouraging the truth is they're discouraging discouraging don't look at them to measure this message right you got to realize if you're typing a young generation that is to cross over the old generation is in trouble you don't want to think like that do you no but listen is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then where is he some way you're supposed to see him when where's you're supposed to see him in the people's lives huh it's good you know it's the truth in what we've done we've done just what the Pharisees and the Sadducees did and I'm fitting closing just a bit but we are it's a point I want to make in a moment but the thing is we've done just what they've done we've cloaked ourselves with the message Jesus said oh you've had a cloak until I came right now you you you look like an uncorruptible Church nothing has corrupted to you you got the full word he said but I'm here I'm the discerner I can see they hated him did you know that the Pharisees and the Sadducees hated Jesus you know like the prophet of God said Pharisees mean to be an actor they acted like they weren't corrupted but they proved they were corrupted because they killed Jesus and they join an alliance with Rome and it was all about money they the Pharisees looked at Jesus Christ as an antagonist one that acted in opposition like he was waiting for him to mess up no he was just being the word and the word is corrective it people's a whole don't be judging me I'm not judging you I'm just saying you just missed the word the word is correct and you're not correct according through the word right it's it's you know you know to be that ameesha to oppose and they just thought he was hostile especially winning winning the temple and he whipped him out like that if I came in with a message like that I think I might get to the church y'all know what I'm saying people expect Jesus to be dodi they expect him to be all soft no no no he if there ever was a man ever man he was a real one he was the art fennec man and he got so upset with the religious system that he planted he got those plants and he planted that thing and he whipped him out of the temple making money off of the gospel that's all I'm saying Christ is always against every false way now you can't call something false if you're not the truth you've got to be the truth and when you're the truth there's a joy there's a peace there's a happiness do you go through battles absolutely but I'm trying to tell you all young people don't settle for what you see you see and you hear on those tapes and it read in this Bible and you want to you want a thirst for that that's what you want that kind of a life is what you want a thirst for not what you're seeing everybody else doing you know to me I think it's like you know it says Lord I said am I am I going crazy am i experiencing what you call a at the age of Vesta because all of the churches are coming together and they just having a great time but how many you have have come in says lord I hear your call they go from the embassy and they're having good meeting stirring up everybody but who's changed I want a stir you should won't change you supposed to go to church and have a good time but at the end of the day when you leave outside that door you want to leave out changed something that's a change that's all I'm saying and the strength of the Christian is what's inside of him which is God Himself can it get it can I go a little further because I was talking about you know how Jesus you know they couldn't stand Jesus they always tried to trap him and that's the way the devil is he's always trying to trap you one way or another hmm yes so anyway let's move on so I'll just say I'm a close with this start the reason why I like I like David as well there was a man of the god of hard and we know that but something dog quicker to me when I'm in my studying is was in 1st Samuel 17 and 2 in Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched by the Valley of Elah and set the battle in array against the Philistines and I thought now here we are you got a group on the mountain a group on the mountain and then saw pitch by by the way of the valley of elah and I thought now what does feel I mean a law means up here II lah is an oak and oak Oak like an oak tree but it also means a curse it means also perjury so you got this you know our oak tree lives a long time just like a curse can live a long time right perjury is when the willful giving of false testimony under oath or from affirmation before a competent tribunal upon a point of materia to legal inquiry in other words it's just giving a false testimony a false oh and here this is why David came on the scene because here they had settled down under a threat from Goliath and they were afraid but this was the army of the Living God you're the army of the Living God why should you fear even God said don't you consider you know what let's go hold tomorrow they look at the sparrow don't I take care of him surely your soul is greater than the sparrow but if you get timid about God's promises God cannot work for you you must be bold I I don't know what else to say it radical hallelujah is that right because listen Abraham I'm sure they said o Abraham come on you guys it's been 12 years now and you haven't had a baby I maybe I don't care what you say and you think he said it nicely you know I really believe that he has some emphasis it doesn't matter what you say God says so see and you have to talk to the devil like that you know you talk to the devil Odelle would please though don't give me those bad thoughts please sound like a crazy man if you won't do it's all right he said well you don't have to scream the devil here I scream even though he know I know he hears me because I want him to feel what I'm saying can you imagine think about the vibrations get out of here right get out of here that's a difference right knock him off his feet yeah so what I'm trying to say is it's all right they gonna call you crazy anyhow but here was they they think they actually come in a place that is cursed and they allowing the the devil amen and in gladly passage so they under this curse in this cursed place they're giving a Goliath a way into their place of heretic inheritance just like we do we feel like oh I'm going through this trial and well they let the devil we'll just let him run his course no he doesn't run no course you must stop the devil that's what God gives you the word for to stop the devil wherever he is if you are look great us believe that you are and start acting like you are and speaking like you are that passage you gotta you gotta move into that in that way so anyway you know they come to fight and David and like all of us we don't know how you know we don't know how to fight the enemy only only with the word but God brings these us to these tests these trials these are challenges so that we can learn how to trust in him because the Lord will fight your battles but you gotta trust him that the Lord will fight your battles you gotta say Lord I need you on this one hallelujah you don't just oh I'm out here no you in it because they said trust the Lord with all your heart right lean not to your own understanding if you acknowledge the Lord in all your ways he shall a will direct your path so here come David a little fella maybe maybe maybe he was no bigger than Isaac or no taller than Joel I don't know but he was Goliath he was nine feet nine nine feet nine inches right that that's six cubits and a span that's six and a half a cubic feet but in the inches that's nine feet and two inches I couldn't even jump in slapping so you got to realize this was a big guy and I don't think he was thin I think it was huge cuz of the way the arm and everything else was can you imagine his sword I think I was too faint for David to take his sword he just probably had to drag that thing over there and cut his head off you're not on me I don't know how he did it but as I was reading it I'm not here as a young boy trying to get this big old sword out of out of Goliath sheath and he had to pick that thing up and cut it head off food all right so you say what do you mean they were in the valley so that's where you meet Goliath in the valley you don't meet him on the mountain probably we the birds are singing on the Mount and the winds are blowing on the Mount and the breeze are smelling good but down in the valleys when the giant comes that's when he begins to say all he's going to say what you can't do you a failure you ain't gave do this you can't do that it ain't gonna happen this dog go too close odd devil shut up now you listen to all that stuff you lose your mind and have a breakdown shut him up when he tells you he's you losers are no devil you're the loser repeat it whatever he says back at him that's what David to hit everything the devil said to him David took it and he reversed it right and it just it's amazing you know David looked at his other fellow people and this is the way I look at everywhere I can't be like these people I just come so hard folks it just seemed like everybody is so afraid of Goliath and nobody want to take the challenge this message bring you to a challenge you got to make up your mind whether you're gonna do it are you going to go all the way with this mess all the way with Jesus Christ what you gonna do with it go all the way oh they even in the in the message they tell you you too religious or you think you better can tell you some of these old folks don't like it when young people really get in the spirit of God they don't like it they didn't like it in my day and then gonna like it in your day right they're gonna think just like David Brothers say oh you come over here and now you out of place right you just come over here to show off that's what they think when you're serving God and trying to give them your heart they think you're trying to show off and all you want to do is give God all your heart but they did it to David you don't think they're gonna do it to you but David says wait a minute is there not a cause is there not a cause look Alliance is making all this boast against you and nobody's going out to fight in you look at the devil here's the pride of Jesus Christ oppose we marching to the tune of the word it is never shown where she ever stopped and we're afraid of today's world with we were so afraid that who you know don't know how to fast we don't know how to pray we're almost afraid of the supernatural but you gotta be more consecrated to see it yeah even the prophet of God God said no before you go any further you've got to be more sincere this way is a safar sincere Christian it ain't for people who looks just want to play around with it it's got to be real to you it's got to be your heartbeat I want it more than anything else how they do you well imma cut it short but that's what happened this is what I love about it just trying to get you to see it you know your weapon might be rocks go it may be a slingshot it may be a rod whatever you got in your hand use it all of our talents are different right ain't gotta use every bit of it whatever it is it was just a few fish and loaves of bread gotta use it if it's just two Mike's got to use it don't think that God just got you sitting here with no talents you've got something to offer every one of us got something to offer and I just believe if these young people if you all would just pull together and just Lord you know we got to have some prayer we got to do something you know constructive you know for the kingdom of God I believe God I answer your prayer I believe God hears you he sees your desires and I know my desire is because I just believe that I was sent here for a purpose I didn't leave Ohio to come to Iowa just a pastor another term I've seen God do some great things in my life and I've asked God one more time I like to see it done and I believe God is going to do it I really do and I believe that you all are part of it but the vision itself must can only be completed by the people in the goose all of us gotta walk is saying God Cleveland cleaving like Paul did they cleaved each other take lead to the word they lead to the Lord I just say to you cleave to him let the strength of God grow in you I know it's a press it is a press but don't think that everything that you go through is it is for purpose and God let make that purpose come to glorify you love the Lord god is so good to us that's a amazing grace oh sweet ah [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know I I thought that at the end of this service of preaching we could sing some more but how I'm just gonna ask everybody if they don't mind just getting on your knees now we're gonna pray you can turn face your chair how do you want to do you know your needs I think I think we all in order for us to go any further if we really mean it and we really want God to do something for the young people in Iowa I think this is where we we started on our knees you pray in your own way and I'm gonna pray to father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how father would out the strength of God in us we are nothing the Lord we have heard your word and your word says that all power is given unto
