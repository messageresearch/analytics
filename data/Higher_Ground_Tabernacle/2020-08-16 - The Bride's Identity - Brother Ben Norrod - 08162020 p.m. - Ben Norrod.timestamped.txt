[52:22] want you to understand that god is going
[52:24] to show us
[52:25] who we are and he's going to show us as
[52:27] we are
[52:28] amen believe that with all of my heart
[52:30] all right exodus chapter 16 now
[52:32] let's pick up verse 31 and uh this may
[52:36] sound like i'm going another direction
[52:37] but you'll see how it ties together
[52:39] momentarily
[52:40] exodus 16 31 and the house of israel
[52:42] called the name thereof
[52:44] manna and it was like coriander seed
[52:46] white
[52:47] the taste of it was like wafers made
[52:50] with honey
[52:51] moses said this is the thing which the
[52:53] lord commandeth
[52:55] fill an omer of it to be kept for your
[52:57] generations
[52:58] that they may see the bread wherewith i
[53:01] have
[53:01] fed you in the wilderness when i brought
[53:04] you forth from the land of egypt and
[53:06] moses said unto aaron take a pot an omer
[53:09] uh full of manna there and lay it up
[53:11] before the lord
[53:12] praise god it's a good place to put it
[53:14] to be kept for your generations
[53:17] all right now listen to this statement
[53:20] brother brahman said now
[53:23] he says for every believer that'll break
[53:26] beyond this curtain
[53:27] honor he said an enter into this
[53:30] priesthood has a right
[53:32] to eat of the original manna that fell
[53:35] on the day of pentecost
[53:36] and he called it a real old-fashioned
[53:39] holy ghost blessing
[53:41] you may be seated may the lord bless
[53:42] this word may god bless you
[53:45] now you say brother ben what in the
[53:49] world does this have to do
[53:51] with the identity of a child of god well
[53:53] i'm glad you asked me i'm going to tell
[53:55] you tonight by the help of the lord
[53:57] first of all something we need to
[53:58] understand is that
[54:00] the bride's identity is not something
[54:03] that is
[54:04] connected or tied together with the
[54:08] worldly identity or with the worldly way
[54:11] of looking at things
[54:12] as we see people in this day and age
[54:15] they have a tendency to
[54:17] uh focus themselves upon uh ball players
[54:21] and uh celebrities and you know and
[54:23] you'll see people wearing that same type
[54:25] of
[54:25] haircut and and uh and dressing the same
[54:28] way and
[54:29] uh talking the same way you know they're
[54:31] looking in some way or another for an
[54:33] identity
[54:34] that they can uh identify themself with
[54:37] and
[54:38] i remember many years ago when i
[54:39] preached on that insanity at galleria
[54:41] that
[54:42] i i reckon that's probably where if i
[54:44] had any fame at all that's where it
[54:45] began was from that message i
[54:47] and i remember what got me fired up and
[54:50] to think the way i was preaching about
[54:52] this spirit of the maniac that's come on
[54:54] the churches and that was
[54:55] i was looking at a uh a magazine
[54:59] and uh that's when friends the
[55:00] television show was red hot and that
[55:02] that girl jennifer
[55:03] aniston you know she had a certain type
[55:05] of haircut
[55:06] and i happened to see it on a
[55:08] advertisement that they had in a
[55:10] in a book i was reading people magazine
[55:12] or something in a doctor's office and i
[55:13] saw that haircut
[55:15] and i got to looking at that and i
[55:16] thought oh ain't no big deal you know
[55:18] but
[55:18] then i noticed that many of the women
[55:20] walking down the street had that same
[55:22] haircut
[55:23] and then i thought well that's the world
[55:25] that's all right that's what they do
[55:26] they find worldly things and then i come
[55:28] into the church and i watch the girls
[55:30] fashion in their hair after the same way
[55:32] and boy that got my holy blood boiling
[55:34] amen
[55:34] or righteous ignoration i'm trying to
[55:37] say and and i thought what a shame it is
[55:40] that people from inside the church would
[55:42] be looking out yonder for some way to
[55:44] identify themselves
[55:46] with the hour that they're living now we
[55:48] know that in the old testament that
[55:50] whenever a person a worshiper
[55:52] would go in behind that veil pull back
[55:54] that veil and lay his hands
[55:57] upon that lamb the purpose of him
[55:59] touching that lamb like that
[56:01] was he was identifying himself with the
[56:04] sacrifice
[56:05] so when he laid his hand upon that
[56:07] animal he cut its little throat and the
[56:09] blood and so forth went
[56:10] and he had his hands laid there as it
[56:13] died
[56:14] holding it until death had overtaken the
[56:16] animal to identify
[56:18] not just in the passing of the sins of
[56:20] israel to this animal
[56:22] but to identify not just in the passing
[56:25] of the sin
[56:25] but in the death sacrifice that would
[56:28] take them into painting over
[56:30] the sins of israel at that time because
[56:31] remember at that time
[56:33] it was just a pain just painted over the
[56:35] sins of israel did nothing to eradicate
[56:38] the sin that was living in the human
[56:40] heart but that priest would go right
[56:42] back in there
[56:43] and his whole purpose of putting his
[56:46] hands on the animal was to identify
[56:48] himself
[56:49] not just on the earth but with god as
[56:51] well who was looking down upon that
[56:54] sacrifice
[56:54] to see the connection between heaven and
[56:57] earth in order
[56:58] for them to be able to do the work of
[57:00] reconciliation
[57:01] now notice again that in the book of
[57:04] mark then
[57:05] when we come to the 16th chapter notice
[57:07] one of the things that jesus
[57:09] requires of us or asks us to do was to
[57:12] identify
[57:13] ourself as believers by what the laying
[57:16] on of hands
[57:17] to another individual showing once again
[57:20] that as we lay our hands on sick folk as
[57:22] we lay our hands on the cast out devils
[57:24] as we sanctioned men of god sanctioned
[57:26] believers and so on so forth
[57:28] our laying on of hands shows us that we
[57:31] are identifying ourself as true
[57:34] believers who believe in the power of
[57:36] god
[57:37] huh are you with me and not only believe
[57:39] in the power of god
[57:40] but believe that god is able to not only
[57:43] use these hands to raise the dead heal
[57:45] the sick
[57:46] cast out devils but we are identifying
[57:49] that heaven and earth has come together
[57:51] in the human form amen you realize what
[57:54] you're saying when you lay hands on
[57:56] somebody or you believe in laying hands
[57:57] on the set
[57:58] you are actually testifying that deity
[58:00] lives in you
[58:02] amen come on somebody now you understand
[58:05] if deity isn't living in you which
[58:06] you're laying your hands on them for
[58:09] what's the purpose of praying the prayer
[58:10] of faith if you're not identifying that
[58:13] deity is living in me
[58:14] what you're putting your hands on them
[58:15] for there's no other reason
[58:17] that's why the bible said don't lay
[58:19] hands on no man suddenly in other words
[58:21] wait out your experience wait out that
[58:23] holy ghost baptism
[58:25] know that you know that you know and
[58:27] then lay hands on the sick
[58:29] and they shall recover amen notice the
[58:32] very first thing
[58:33] that that a president will do when he's
[58:35] being sworn in he will go up there and i
[58:38] believe god's going to hold these men
[58:39] accountable for this
[58:40] they will lay their hands on the bible
[58:42] and they will swear to uphold the office
[58:44] of the president but don't forget
[58:46] by them identifying with that bible
[58:48] they're supposed to be telling the
[58:49] nation
[58:50] we are going to uphold the laws of god
[58:54] that's the whole reason when you go into
[58:55] a courtroom and they lay their hand on
[58:57] the bible i swear
[58:59] to tell the truth the whole truth and
[59:00] nothing but the truth now if you're
[59:02] lying
[59:03] what that identifies is that you're not
[59:05] lying to that court you're not just
[59:07] lying to that judge and lying to that
[59:08] jury or that group of people
[59:10] but you are testifying that before god
[59:13] you are a liar
[59:15] praise the lord somebody amen now you
[59:17] realize
[59:18] that when a person then would move into
[59:21] this identification
[59:22] in israel they would move into this way
[59:24] of laying their hands on that animal
[59:27] and believing that the worshiper was
[59:30] going to be forgiven of their sins
[59:32] you realize that in the eyes of god
[59:34] there was an actual
[59:35] transfer that took place of the people's
[59:38] sin
[59:39] to that animal you may not have been
[59:41] able to see it all the biologists and
[59:43] the chemists and
[59:44] the chemist and all these folks they may
[59:46] not have been able to take a dna test
[59:48] and be able to prove represent his sin
[59:50] on it but by laying their hands on her
[59:52] brother brooks
[59:53] god identified that there was a transfer
[59:56] maid
[59:57] oh hello somebody amen no wonder that
[1:00:00] jesus
[1:00:01] when he come to the resurrection time
[1:00:03] amen there had to be the pattern laid
[1:00:06] out there
[1:00:06] of old poor downton thomas we feel so
[1:00:09] sorry for
[1:00:10] but remember he said unless i get to
[1:00:12] touch him
[1:00:13] amen put my finger you know what he was
[1:00:15] showing that the resurrection
[1:00:17] was identified here on this earth man
[1:00:20] connecting himself with the resurrection
[1:00:23] laying his hands on as thomas laid his
[1:00:26] hands
[1:00:26] on them remember when jesus blessed the
[1:00:28] little children he laid his hands on
[1:00:30] those children
[1:00:31] and he blessed them amen and said such
[1:00:33] is the kingdom of god
[1:00:34] don't forbid it in other words he was
[1:00:37] identifying
[1:00:38] that god loves little children amen
[1:00:41] well y'all have been holiday man because
[1:00:43] at one time that was you
[1:00:45] amen right now now now notice again i i
[1:00:48] love this
[1:00:49] people can go to church and they can
[1:00:51] identify themselves with believers
[1:00:54] but remember in the old testament
[1:00:57] whenever the bible referred
[1:00:59] to their feet that was their goings but
[1:01:01] their hands was symbolic
[1:01:03] of their doings remember he talked about
[1:01:07] keeping your hands clean
[1:01:09] keeping your skirts clean keeping
[1:01:11] yourself pure
[1:01:12] remember to take the mark of the beast
[1:01:15] is also to give the right hand to
[1:01:16] fellowship
[1:01:18] that doesn't mean just always shaking
[1:01:19] the pastor's hand or that seven foot
[1:01:21] icicle that stands up there looking so
[1:01:23] good on cameras
[1:01:25] amen it ain't got nothing to do with
[1:01:27] that but it is the identity
[1:01:29] of you are identifying yourself with
[1:01:32] that that is contrary to the bible and
[1:01:34] the revelation of the hour
[1:01:36] amen that's what the mark of the beast
[1:01:37] is it is those that identify themselves
[1:01:40] with that that is god contrary you
[1:01:43] understand a lot of people around this
[1:01:45] message have taken the mark of the beast
[1:01:46] they just don't know they have
[1:01:48] amen again remember referring back to
[1:01:50] the church some many years ago
[1:01:52] going back 20 years or more now probably
[1:01:54] and i remember preaching a message on
[1:01:57] the mark of the beast and i remember
[1:01:58] this specifically brother isaiah
[1:02:00] i had asked you to let me stay in the
[1:02:02] office that afternoon and
[1:02:03] i felt led to just pray and talk to the
[1:02:05] lord and as i was studying the message
[1:02:07] and sitting in there
[1:02:09] amen and i never will forget this i
[1:02:11] thought this was really profound to me
[1:02:12] it was profound
[1:02:14] but i was sitting in that room and i was
[1:02:16] studying about these out there and the
[1:02:18] systems that had taken the mark of the
[1:02:19] beast
[1:02:20] and all at once the holy ghost i didn't
[1:02:22] see him but i knew he was there that
[1:02:24] pillar of fire come in that room
[1:02:26] i heard him start talking to me he said
[1:02:28] not just out there
[1:02:29] but they've done it right here around
[1:02:31] the ranks of the message and i never
[1:02:33] will forget about the time that holy
[1:02:34] ghost come in
[1:02:35] just moments after he said them words
[1:02:37] brother isaiah pulled the door open he
[1:02:38] stepped in he went whoo
[1:02:40] the fire is here i thought thank you
[1:02:41] lord i needed to hear that
[1:02:43] amen he knew what daddy felt like he
[1:02:46] knew he was there
[1:02:47] amen but that's when the lord spoke to
[1:02:49] me many years ago
[1:02:50] that they're doing the same thing around
[1:02:52] the message of the hour
[1:02:54] they identify themselves as believers by
[1:02:57] saying brother branham said
[1:02:58] brother branham said brother branham did
[1:03:00] brother ben and this brother been a man
[1:03:02] but until they are identified by going
[1:03:05] back behind that that holy of holies
[1:03:07] behind the curtain back there
[1:03:08] and they can get a mouthful of the
[1:03:11] original blessing i'm talking about the
[1:03:12] holy ghost
[1:03:14] and be born again i don't care what they
[1:03:16] identify with
[1:03:17] they're still not a believer until they
[1:03:18] go there
[1:03:20] remember that original manner that fell
[1:03:22] in the beginning brother frank
[1:03:25] if they went back behind that veil as
[1:03:26] long as it was in the presence of the
[1:03:28] lord there wasn't one thing that would
[1:03:29] rot in that bread
[1:03:31] it was pure it was clean the cells of it
[1:03:34] if you want to say it that way or the
[1:03:36] strands or the fibers of that bread
[1:03:37] would be just as perfect as when god
[1:03:40] created and it fell on the ground
[1:03:42] because the presence of the lord
[1:03:43] sustained it
[1:03:45] amen that that was outside the veil well
[1:03:47] that was a different story
[1:03:50] yeah it's amazing to me when you look at
[1:03:52] the church they're a type of them two
[1:03:54] breads
[1:03:55] you see those they can barely make it
[1:03:58] from sunday to sunday
[1:04:00] they just start withering away and
[1:04:01] rotten first little revival comes along
[1:04:04] boy
[1:04:05] glory to god i'm here amen by the next
[1:04:07] sunday they're out of it you know why
[1:04:09] because they didn't take their
[1:04:10] experience and put it in the presence of
[1:04:12] the lord
[1:04:13] amen that's why we should pray and read
[1:04:15] our bible and stay in the word
[1:04:17] and stay in them tapes amen come to
[1:04:19] church participate in church
[1:04:21] amen love your your brother amen and
[1:04:24] stand against sin stand against the
[1:04:26] wrong
[1:04:27] because every bit that you do is going
[1:04:29] to take you that much closer to having
[1:04:31] that real pentecostal experience
[1:04:34] but what is the bride supposed to look
[1:04:36] like all right now let me slow down just
[1:04:38] a moment
[1:04:39] i got something i want to say and here
[1:04:42] here it is
[1:04:43] i'm not going to make you wait for him
[1:04:45] i'll tell you now okay
[1:04:47] the problem we have i believe around our
[1:04:49] ranks
[1:04:50] is we have long forgot how we were first
[1:04:54] identified
[1:04:55] in this message there has been so many
[1:05:00] sermons trying to reshape reform redraw
[1:05:05] repaint what the bride is supposed to
[1:05:07] look like people
[1:05:08] sit in mass confusion all the time
[1:05:11] that's one reason why when men of god
[1:05:12] come to the platform
[1:05:13] and we preach on the opening of the word
[1:05:15] or we preach on the power of god or we
[1:05:17] preach on the holy ghost people say oh
[1:05:19] we don't need that stuff
[1:05:21] you understand why because men have
[1:05:23] taken this truth
[1:05:25] now i'm just being honest with you let's
[1:05:26] just talk tonight
[1:05:28] but men have taken this bible and
[1:05:30] they've restructured what the bride's
[1:05:32] identity is supposed to look like
[1:05:35] as a believer i believe that every part
[1:05:38] of god
[1:05:38] belongs to me ain't nothing that he's
[1:05:41] got that i can't say amen to
[1:05:43] there ain't nothing he's got that i
[1:05:45] can't experience
[1:05:47] however when you come to certain message
[1:05:49] churches they'll tell you
[1:05:51] oh just settle down you don't need all
[1:05:52] that hollering stuff well maybe they
[1:05:54] don't i do
[1:05:56] huh maybe they don't need to worship
[1:05:58] when they come to church
[1:06:00] i do i don't like coming in and sitting
[1:06:02] down and just whatever whatever whatever
[1:06:05] you know que sera sera whatever it'll be
[1:06:07] you'll be
[1:06:09] huh some of them same people say i watch
[1:06:12] a movie for two and a half hours and
[1:06:13] they're so enjoying it
[1:06:15] and that they're salivating at the mouth
[1:06:16] they love it
[1:06:18] comes to the things of the house of god
[1:06:20] nothing enthusiasm
[1:06:22] they're not interested in the power of
[1:06:23] god moving in the sanctuary
[1:06:25] they're not interested in the service of
[1:06:26] the lord what they're interested in
[1:06:29] is identifying themselves with an escape
[1:06:32] hatch
[1:06:35] the message is not a fire escape
[1:06:40] are you with me god didn't send us this
[1:06:43] truth
[1:06:44] just to escape hell come on now you
[1:06:48] hey the five or six in here you can
[1:06:49] holler a man every now and then they're
[1:06:50] going to hurt you
[1:06:51] huh god did not send us this truth
[1:06:56] just to escape hell if the only reason
[1:06:59] i'm serving god is to keep from going to
[1:07:01] hell
[1:07:02] i'm serving him for the wrong reason if
[1:07:05] i love him right
[1:07:06] and he wanted to send me to hell i say
[1:07:09] lord
[1:07:10] thy will be done not mine if i loved him
[1:07:13] right
[1:07:14] a lot of people don't have that in their
[1:07:15] mind because to them
[1:07:18] the truth of god's word is only an
[1:07:20] avenue for them to find a way out of
[1:07:22] misery
[1:07:25] not realizing that when you become a
[1:07:27] christian you'll fight misery day in and
[1:07:29] day out
[1:07:32] look i don't know about you all but i
[1:07:34] fight things all the time
[1:07:36] and the devil if i didn't keep myself
[1:07:38] prayed up and keep fighting
[1:07:40] and forging ahead the devil would
[1:07:42] overwhelm me swallow me up and i
[1:07:44] you put me in a little tiny box there
[1:07:46] wouldn't be nothing left of me he'd just
[1:07:47] chip away chip await your boy
[1:07:49] until i was non-existent but for the
[1:07:52] grace of god
[1:07:55] but the bride's identity and i want you
[1:07:56] to think about this the bride's identity
[1:07:59] is more than going to church listen
[1:08:02] i can be a real believer and never
[1:08:05] darken the door of a building called a
[1:08:08] church
[1:08:10] oh now you say but rather being
[1:08:11] christians go to church i know that
[1:08:13] but don't get ahead of me we're talking
[1:08:16] about what makes you a believer first
[1:08:19] sure believers go to church but i don't
[1:08:21] have to be in here to be a believer
[1:08:24] i can be on the backside of a desert a
[1:08:26] million miles from a preacher
[1:08:28] and if i read his word and i believe his
[1:08:30] word and he puts his holy ghost in my
[1:08:32] heart
[1:08:32] i can be a believer if i don't know
[1:08:34] nothing about nobody called the message
[1:08:36] sure if god deals with me if he deals
[1:08:39] with me of course he'll lead you to the
[1:08:40] truth he'll
[1:08:41] let you go to church on and on and on i
[1:08:43] get that
[1:08:44] but you're not understanding my point
[1:08:46] the point is if i
[1:08:47] am a christian by christian identity my
[1:08:51] identity is not tied to where i sit and
[1:08:53] appear somewhere
[1:08:57] right that's what happened to the
[1:08:59] denominations
[1:09:01] oh we are methodists we are a baptist
[1:09:04] we are presbyterian and now of course we
[1:09:07] are a message
[1:09:08] well it's just a convenient little thing
[1:09:10] it just slips right on in
[1:09:13] now i want to ask you a question did
[1:09:14] they call them first at antioch message
[1:09:16] believers
[1:09:18] what do they call them why because that
[1:09:21] was their identity
[1:09:23] the life of jesus christ which is
[1:09:27] christian there was such an identity
[1:09:30] inside and brother troy
[1:09:32] that when the people looked autumn glory
[1:09:34] to god
[1:09:35] they saw the lord jesus living in them
[1:09:38] human bodies
[1:09:40] praise god it ought to show us something
[1:09:45] notice people that go to bars
[1:09:49] and one of the good things that's come
[1:09:50] out of this coronavirus they shut all
[1:09:51] these bars down thank god for it
[1:09:56] people go to bars and other places to
[1:09:58] identify themselves with what drinking
[1:10:00] carousing running around this that the
[1:10:02] other
[1:10:03] they go to that bar because there is
[1:10:06] where they're going to identify
[1:10:07] themselves with how they're going to
[1:10:09] live
[1:10:10] why do we go to church then do i come to
[1:10:13] the house of god could you imagine a
[1:10:14] fellow now let's reverse this around for
[1:10:16] a moment
[1:10:17] all right i know you all are wore out
[1:10:20] i'm not picking on you for being quiet
[1:10:22] but could you imagine some fella going
[1:10:24] into a bar the music is blaring
[1:10:27] you hear the clinking of the glasses
[1:10:28] everybody's drinking and laughing and
[1:10:30] they're socializing and they're going on
[1:10:31] and on and on and on and so forth like
[1:10:33] that
[1:10:34] and you got one fella sitting in there
[1:10:36] and you've got your arms folded now
[1:10:37] i can't hardly say arm's folded now
[1:10:39] because i'm getting wrists are unfolding
[1:10:41] but maybe some fella sitting in the
[1:10:42] middle of the thing with his arms folded
[1:10:45] like this an
[1:10:46] old sour look on his face you understand
[1:10:48] and and and here he's standing there
[1:10:50] like that
[1:10:51] and he's not having a good time you
[1:10:53] don't have to ask him you can see it
[1:10:56] he ain't got no glass in his hand he
[1:10:57] ain't took not one sip of nothing
[1:11:00] somebody's told him 14 bar jokes and he
[1:11:02] ain't laughed at none of them
[1:11:03] i'm gonna ask you a question even though
[1:11:05] he is in that bar would you call him a
[1:11:07] real bar man or drinker
[1:11:10] you think something's wrong with you man
[1:11:12] why in the world did you come to this
[1:11:13] bar
[1:11:14] to sit there on the stool like a little
[1:11:16] pigeon
[1:11:19] all right let's flip the coin a little
[1:11:21] bit why do people come to church
[1:11:24] and the only reason they come to church
[1:11:26] is because it's doing our religion time
[1:11:28] they're not enjoying themselves they
[1:11:30] have no joy of the lord they're not
[1:11:32] hearing from the holy spirit oh i see
[1:11:33] anybody hearing me
[1:11:35] they're not receiving from the lord
[1:11:37] they're not taking into their soul
[1:11:39] the holy ghost power that's going to get
[1:11:42] them through the rest of the week
[1:11:44] they are miserable well my advice to you
[1:11:47] is if you're miserable not you
[1:11:48] specifically here of course but
[1:11:50] in general my advice is if you're having
[1:11:52] such a miserable time leave
[1:11:58] well but we don't want to leave it true
[1:12:00] why because
[1:12:01] tied to that is the identity of i
[1:12:05] want to escape hell sure so they come
[1:12:08] and they're religious and on and on and
[1:12:10] on and they've got all the religious
[1:12:11] ossities and all that kind of stuff like
[1:12:13] that
[1:12:14] and it ain't done them a bit of good not
[1:12:16] a bit of good
[1:12:18] some people in this message the only
[1:12:20] benefit some of them are in not all of
[1:12:22] them now
[1:12:23] i don't want to demonize everybody
[1:12:26] but the only thing some people have done
[1:12:28] only good they've ever been is they've
[1:12:29] helped pay the light bill
[1:12:34] words amen in case you forgot
[1:12:39] some of the only benefits some people
[1:12:40] have ever been
[1:12:42] is they've just been able to help pay
[1:12:43] the light bill that's not the identity
[1:12:46] of a saint of god
[1:12:48] you realize if the hour comes that they
[1:12:50] do shut our churches down and we have to
[1:12:51] worship elsewhere
[1:12:52] a lot of people are going to be hurting
[1:12:55] because to them christianity is about
[1:12:57] coming to a certain church hearing a
[1:12:58] certain preacher
[1:12:59] a certain set of singers or musicians or
[1:13:01] whatever whatever whatever
[1:13:02] and at the end of the day oh this is my
[1:13:04] church this is my group
[1:13:05] i'm a believer and glory to god and
[1:13:07] hallelujah if all that gets shut down
[1:13:11] of course when the quarantine happened i
[1:13:12] was laughing i told my wife
[1:13:14] i wasn't making fun when i said this but
[1:13:16] i was laughing because i said well
[1:13:18] all the important people that didn't
[1:13:19] want to go to church know how they're
[1:13:21] probably rejoicing some of them never
[1:13:23] shouted
[1:13:24] in the house of god not one time but
[1:13:26] when they heard president trump say
[1:13:27] everybody lock down no more
[1:13:29] church they probably just stands to jig
[1:13:31] right there
[1:13:35] because to some people this is
[1:13:37] unnecessary
[1:13:40] you realize that
[1:13:46] notice we have a specific identity by
[1:13:49] our first
[1:13:50] birth if you need me to prove that
[1:13:54] i'll just hold a mirror up to you
[1:13:58] look at yourself in the mirror and tell
[1:14:01] me what you see
[1:14:04] you'll see your mama's nose your daddy's
[1:14:07] ears
[1:14:08] come on huh you'll see
[1:14:11] characteristics that's been handed down
[1:14:13] to you
[1:14:15] that is identified in your first birth
[1:14:18] well if all of those things have been
[1:14:20] passed down to us
[1:14:21] by daddy what about them other things
[1:14:24] glory
[1:14:25] that's been passed down by daddy
[1:14:28] all of them characteristics should be
[1:14:30] falling into our life
[1:14:31] to where when we look at the picture we
[1:14:33] ought to be able to see jesus christ
[1:14:38] this was our this was our visual aid
[1:14:41] this morning
[1:14:44] this little black sister she's a little
[1:14:46] african sister we i think we got put
[1:14:48] together
[1:14:48] we didn't ever figure out congolese or
[1:14:50] where's she from anyhow congolese i
[1:14:52] guess right
[1:14:55] but when you look at this little gal
[1:14:56] right here she's going to reflect
[1:14:58] somebody
[1:15:00] the mother and the father cannot come
[1:15:02] together and share the chromosomes
[1:15:04] without there being an identity glory
[1:15:06] laying right in themselves
[1:15:09] that comes right out in that bloodstream
[1:15:12] and when you're forming in your mother's
[1:15:13] womb those characteristics are being
[1:15:16] birthed into you
[1:15:18] oh god i hope somebody hear me as a
[1:15:20] christian
[1:15:22] the characteristics of the word should
[1:15:25] be birthed into me
[1:15:27] till i start having daddy's love
[1:15:31] daddy's patience i should have daddy's
[1:15:34] grace for matters
[1:15:36] his wisdom in situations as you realize
[1:15:39] when we go out of here the only thing we
[1:15:41] can take with us
[1:15:42] is the character that has been developed
[1:15:44] within us
[1:15:46] that's the only thing that i'm desiring
[1:15:48] anyways is to have the right character
[1:15:51] and to have the right understanding of
[1:15:53] what it means to be a genuine christian
[1:15:55] now
[1:15:55] watch this again i i love this now
[1:15:58] brother brahman said in walu bethlehem
[1:16:00] we think of god doing things in unusual
[1:16:02] ways because he is unusual himself
[1:16:05] god is unusually supernatural the
[1:16:07] infinite he said and we the finite he
[1:16:09] said so anything god does
[1:16:11] is unusual and god is so great watch
[1:16:14] till he
[1:16:15] takes unidentified things by the earth
[1:16:19] to identify himself by it
[1:16:24] so here you've got noah he's walking
[1:16:27] around
[1:16:29] no no ambitions no aspirations
[1:16:34] him he's not going to become the
[1:16:35] greatest farmer that ever lived
[1:16:37] folks noah is not going to become a
[1:16:41] champion
[1:16:41] pumpkin grower he's not going to have
[1:16:44] the biggest watermelon
[1:16:46] at the fair that year noah is a
[1:16:50] simple somebody you would ignore
[1:16:54] if you saw him on the street
[1:16:58] and god took a look at that little
[1:16:59] prophet
[1:17:01] and the bible said noah found grace
[1:17:05] in the eyes of the lord he took an i
[1:17:07] unidentified
[1:17:08] something and god attached himself
[1:17:13] to that unidentified something
[1:17:16] praise god and praise god
[1:17:19] don't you realize a lot of people around
[1:17:20] this message that are real true genuine
[1:17:22] christians listen to their testimony
[1:17:25] they wasn't going nowhere they had no
[1:17:27] ambitions of their own
[1:17:29] maybe perhaps they wasn't even trying to
[1:17:31] figure out what their life was going to
[1:17:33] look like in 20 years
[1:17:35] all of a sudden the holy ghost gets a
[1:17:36] hold of them
[1:17:38] now they're preachers now they're
[1:17:39] deacons now they're this they're that
[1:17:41] and the other
[1:17:42] why god took unidentified substance
[1:17:46] and identified himself
[1:17:50] right down with that humanity as i said
[1:17:52] if you're going to lay hands on them why
[1:17:54] would you lay hands
[1:17:55] unless deity is identified with you
[1:17:59] he takes the ridiculous
[1:18:03] and makes something so wonderful out of
[1:18:05] it
[1:18:09] that the former of what it was is
[1:18:11] completely forgotten
[1:18:13] and the only thing you see left is the
[1:18:16] image and the characteristics
[1:18:18] of jesus christ in that life
[1:18:22] you see with brother branham one thing
[1:18:24] that appeals to me
[1:18:26] about his ministry and listen i don't
[1:18:29] care what critics say
[1:18:30] about william branham the one thing that
[1:18:33] i love about this prophet of god the one
[1:18:35] thing i
[1:18:35] love about this man is he came
[1:18:38] from a background where his only road
[1:18:42] was to wind up a drunk like the rest of
[1:18:43] the branhams
[1:18:46] i don't get offended that's what he told
[1:18:47] us he said all of us branham's died with
[1:18:50] our boots on
[1:18:52] god took his little kentuckian got his
[1:18:55] hands on him
[1:18:57] identified himself with him when you
[1:18:59] look at william branham no matter what
[1:19:00] you might say about him out yonder
[1:19:03] the one thing you'll never say about
[1:19:04] william branham is he did not die a
[1:19:06] drunk with his boots on like the rest of
[1:19:07] the branhams
[1:19:10] agree with him or disagree with him when
[1:19:11] he went out of this world
[1:19:13] jesus christ had identified himself in
[1:19:16] so much that he had his photo taken with
[1:19:18] him
[1:19:21] oh i i know what some of them say they
[1:19:23] they make the remark that
[1:19:24] oh you know that that was the same type
[1:19:26] of light and so forth that was over the
[1:19:28] beatles when they took the pictures of
[1:19:30] ed sullivan and they had them streaks
[1:19:31] above them too
[1:19:33] i don't believe that i'll tell you why i
[1:19:35] don't believe that
[1:19:36] first of all the holy spirit is not a
[1:19:39] white streak his color ain't like that
[1:19:42] if you've ever seen the pillar of fire
[1:19:43] if the lord ever let you permit to see
[1:19:45] it or if you read it in the bible about
[1:19:47] his color he's an amber yellowish color
[1:19:51] ain't no white streak like that the
[1:19:54] difference in them black and whites over
[1:19:55] the beetles is if you was to put them in
[1:19:57] color you'd see a light about like that
[1:19:59] but if you was to put that one about
[1:20:01] brother brahma's head in color you'd see
[1:20:02] an amber yellowish gold
[1:20:04] color amen god hides it from the eyes of
[1:20:07] the wise and prudent and reveals it to
[1:20:08] babes
[1:20:11] god so identified himself with this
[1:20:13] little kentuckian
[1:20:14] until seven times around the world that
[1:20:17] theme only
[1:20:18] believe has always been identified with
[1:20:19] the ministry of william branham
[1:20:21] he never died with a a drunk with his
[1:20:24] boots on like the rest of the branhams
[1:20:26] god identified himself with that life
[1:20:29] now
[1:20:30] i want you to think about some of the
[1:20:32] different things that we could say
[1:20:34] for example we could pick up the life of
[1:20:37] john baptist
[1:20:38] look at him god sends him into the
[1:20:41] wilderness
[1:20:42] as he sends him into the wilderness he
[1:20:44] comes out stomping on the bank with
[1:20:46] locust wings between his teeth and honey
[1:20:48] running down his beard
[1:20:51] he steps out on that jordan i'm a voice
[1:20:55] of one crying in the wilderness you
[1:20:58] realize that
[1:20:59] his future could have been maybe a
[1:21:02] pharisee like his daddy
[1:21:04] maybe we could say he had there was high
[1:21:07] hopes for him
[1:21:09] to pick up the mantle as they say and do
[1:21:11] like the rest of his family has done
[1:21:14] john goes into the wilderness he becomes
[1:21:17] unidentified
[1:21:18] with everything around him to do what to
[1:21:21] allow the word of god to identify itself
[1:21:23] in john
[1:21:25] any old fellow could have walked out on
[1:21:26] the bank and started hauling the words
[1:21:28] from isaiah 40. isaiah 40.
[1:21:30] uh you know uh i i'm here and and uh
[1:21:34] uh to announce the savior i'm here to
[1:21:36] announce the messiah anybody could have
[1:21:38] so i had no voice anybody could have
[1:21:40] said that but the identity was
[1:21:42] whenever jesus christ comes to him
[1:21:44] standing there in the water
[1:21:46] and the holy ghost comes out of heaven
[1:21:47] said this is my beloved son
[1:21:50] john was identified with who he really
[1:21:54] was
[1:21:56] i go hold you alone tonight you wore out
[1:21:59] i get it i'm going to hold you an
[1:22:00] hour listen to me
[1:22:04] what kind of identity do we have in this
[1:22:06] message today
[1:22:08] if the only thing we know is what we can
[1:22:10] read
[1:22:11] we better go right back to the very
[1:22:13] beginning tear this house down
[1:22:14] and start from the foundation because
[1:22:18] this
[1:22:19] in general none of this
[1:22:23] church memorization
[1:22:27] quotings of scripture and on and on none
[1:22:30] of that is going to matter anything when
[1:22:32] it comes to the rapture
[1:22:34] if what we're talking about it being the
[1:22:37] lord jesus
[1:22:38] if it doesn't identify itself with us
[1:22:42] then all we've done is pick up the
[1:22:43] mantle of a church
[1:22:45] and walked on like a believer and never
[1:22:48] become a real believer
[1:22:50] uh oh i'm gonna tell you something
[1:22:51] remember what he said about the holy
[1:22:53] ghost
[1:22:54] he said the holy ghost isn't when you
[1:22:55] accept the holy ghost
[1:22:58] ah it's when the holy ghost accepts you
[1:23:02] so it's not when i say well i receive
[1:23:04] the holy ghost be careful with that
[1:23:06] remark
[1:23:06] because it ain't true you have never
[1:23:09] received anything
[1:23:11] it's been god's grace to give it to you
[1:23:13] oh no i know the meaning of what you're
[1:23:15] saying received in other words god gave
[1:23:16] it to me
[1:23:17] but the way we say it i receive we put
[1:23:19] that eye in there and make it real
[1:23:20] strong
[1:23:22] i didn't have nothing to do with it he
[1:23:24] spoke to me his word
[1:23:26] he told me what his requirement was i
[1:23:28] lined my soul and my life up to that
[1:23:30] word
[1:23:30] amen and when i met his requirement then
[1:23:32] he gave to me
[1:23:34] what it was i was asking for
[1:23:37] brother ram said that seal like we
[1:23:39] talked about this morning that seal of
[1:23:41] approval is god's amen to you
[1:23:44] if you say you are a believer then he
[1:23:46] has to amen what you're saying
[1:23:49] if you don't a man that you're not a
[1:23:50] believer
[1:23:52] oh my oh i i i don't i don't know where
[1:23:55] to go from here but there's a hundred
[1:23:56] ways we could go
[1:23:59] huh watch this in questions and answers
[1:24:02] what is the evidence that a person is
[1:24:03] really filled with the holy ghost
[1:24:06] you all ready
[1:24:09] saint john 14 26 brother quotes he says
[1:24:11] when the holy ghost has come he will
[1:24:13] show you things to come
[1:24:14] see he'll perfect it
[1:24:21] so upon the basis of those words
[1:24:24] then in other words if i've got the true
[1:24:27] holy ghost
[1:24:28] then i don't have to perfect myself
[1:24:34] oh come on somebody come on bite your
[1:24:36] cheek
[1:24:37] slap your leg or something come on get
[1:24:38] with me
[1:24:41] it has nothing to do with what me
[1:24:44] can perfect me
[1:24:47] he will perfect
[1:24:51] it which means if i've got the real holy
[1:24:55] ghost do you understand
[1:24:57] i genuinely don't have to do
[1:25:01] nothing
[1:25:04] if i have to something to do with it how
[1:25:06] could i get saved in the first place
[1:25:08] salvation is not of man it's of the lord
[1:25:11] so if i've got the true holy ghost he'll
[1:25:13] perfect it what does that look like well
[1:25:15] you take people in churches when they
[1:25:17] hear certain things preach they hear
[1:25:18] quotes read
[1:25:19] they hear scriptures uh uh quoted and
[1:25:22] laid out there and then
[1:25:23] uh you know the the holy spirit will
[1:25:25] just straighten out some little mess
[1:25:27] laying in people's minds or
[1:25:28] unravel some little doctrine they've got
[1:25:30] all mixed up
[1:25:32] if i've got the holy ghost the moment i
[1:25:35] hear it
[1:25:36] he on the inside will bring me to that
[1:25:40] perfection that's been laid out in front
[1:25:41] of me
[1:25:43] remember friends schofield had it right
[1:25:46] perfection when jesus said matthew 5 48
[1:25:49] be you perfect as my father in heaven is
[1:25:50] perfect
[1:25:51] scofield said it's not sinless
[1:25:53] perfection that's right
[1:25:54] because the true meaning of that word
[1:25:56] perfect doesn't mean sinless it means
[1:25:59] mature
[1:26:02] it means i've come to a place to where
[1:26:06] if i'm wrong i'm just going to admit it
[1:26:12] i'd lost all of you anyhow but i've lost
[1:26:14] the rest of you for sure now
[1:26:16] come on but if i've got the holy ghost
[1:26:20] on the inside don't you understand
[1:26:23] that something on the inside of me will
[1:26:25] make me
[1:26:26] come to that word and admit
[1:26:30] my way is wrong
[1:26:34] amen he listen to this
[1:26:37] man maids won't do it
[1:26:40] well you know so-and-so said and
[1:26:42] so-and-so told me and one brother
[1:26:43] mentioned and one brother said to me and
[1:26:45] i
[1:26:45] i heard somebody say man maids won't
[1:26:47] bring you to perfection
[1:26:50] because like i told you this morning
[1:26:52] anybody can tell you what they think
[1:26:54] about what you're supposed to be
[1:26:56] but at the end of the day the picture
[1:26:57] that god's got in his mind of you that
[1:26:59] is the only thing that god sees that's
[1:27:01] the only thing that matters
[1:27:04] and if i tell you to watch your temper
[1:27:05] or i tell you to not be
[1:27:07] impatient or whatever whatever whatever
[1:27:09] i could be completely getting
[1:27:10] out of the will of god because
[1:27:13] underneath your temper or impatience
[1:27:15] might not be nothing about temper or
[1:27:17] impatience it might be pride
[1:27:20] it might be something else hiding
[1:27:21] underneath only he
[1:27:23] that knows the true picture can unravel
[1:27:26] the mystery of such things
[1:27:29] so manmades won't do it that's why some
[1:27:33] years ago when
[1:27:34] uh when the jenkins boy and and and most
[1:27:37] of them guys was running around the
[1:27:39] message with all their james dobson
[1:27:40] books and they were laying them out
[1:27:41] before everybody and
[1:27:43] self-help and heal your spirit and
[1:27:45] listen i believe
[1:27:47] that there is an element of truth in
[1:27:49] some of those things
[1:27:50] but we have to be careful that we're not
[1:27:52] trying to fix
[1:27:54] ourself upon the basis of a man-made
[1:27:58] idea
[1:28:00] listen i believe if you've got
[1:28:01] psychological problems go see a doctor
[1:28:04] if you need medicine take it or else
[1:28:07] don't fool
[1:28:07] the doctors in the first place you're
[1:28:08] gonna do what they say don't don't go to
[1:28:10] them
[1:28:13] but that shouldn't be our only outlet
[1:28:15] come on now
[1:28:17] our identity should be deeper than that
[1:28:22] so a man-made will not bring me to that
[1:28:24] place i i could have all kinds of
[1:28:26] psychological problems i've seen people
[1:28:28] that are
[1:28:29] are so mixed up in their mind that you
[1:28:32] can't get the word
[1:28:33] through remember the prophet said the
[1:28:35] word's got to come here before it can go
[1:28:37] here
[1:28:38] and i have advised and counsel people go
[1:28:41] get professional help
[1:28:43] and you know what for those that really
[1:28:44] want to be right with god
[1:28:46] and they sit down and talk to a
[1:28:47] counselor or somebody that's got some
[1:28:49] skill to help them talk about issues or
[1:28:51] whatever whatever whatever
[1:28:52] and they come to the place that actually
[1:28:54] helps them to get them calm down where
[1:28:56] they can open their heart and say
[1:28:58] i understand it now not all of that
[1:29:01] stuff is bunk
[1:29:03] not all of that stuff is nonsense and
[1:29:04] trash
[1:29:06] sometimes things can help but it must be
[1:29:08] something directed by the holy spirit
[1:29:11] this is why brother madam said that
[1:29:13] nerve medication will only make you
[1:29:15] worse
[1:29:15] because the the underlying issue is
[1:29:18] something laying in your human spirit
[1:29:21] takes god to heal it
[1:29:25] they take nervous medicine to keep from
[1:29:27] being nervous and then
[1:29:28] they get you know almost stoic and
[1:29:31] robotic and then they have to take a
[1:29:33] medicine to animate them again
[1:29:37] one to up them one to down them no
[1:29:40] wonder the lady will see such a lukewarm
[1:29:42] age they're always being pulled to the
[1:29:43] middle
[1:29:47] you understand me now notice he will
[1:29:50] identify himself when the holy ghost
[1:29:52] comes
[1:29:53] with the scripture and that is the true
[1:29:56] sign
[1:29:56] that the holy spirit is in you because
[1:29:59] it
[1:29:59] is the word he said now look what if you
[1:30:03] what if you spoke with tongues i want to
[1:30:05] ask you jesus said
[1:30:06] when the holy ghost would come what
[1:30:07] would he do
[1:30:09] and if you spoke with tongues jumped up
[1:30:10] down shouted everything else then it
[1:30:12] comes to the word now listen
[1:30:14] i'll tell you the proof by the scripture
[1:30:19] that the baptism of titles father son
[1:30:21] and holy ghost
[1:30:22] is a misunderstanding in the scripture
[1:30:25] why is that so important when he's
[1:30:26] talking about the holy ghost
[1:30:29] because father has no identity
[1:30:33] son has no specific identity
[1:30:36] holy spirit has no specific identity
[1:30:41] father could be anybody's father that's
[1:30:44] why in baptism whenever you're baptizing
[1:30:46] somebody
[1:30:47] we don't play around we don't play games
[1:30:49] we call the names specifically
[1:30:52] we identify when we put them in the
[1:30:54] water who it is that we're bearing them
[1:30:56] in
[1:30:58] glory in the name of the lord jesus
[1:31:01] christ
[1:31:02] i baptize you for the remission of sins
[1:31:05] we don't goof off of some of these
[1:31:06] things like organizations does
[1:31:08] i baptize you in the name of the father
[1:31:10] oh well that's real specific ain't it
[1:31:13] what father holy father pope father
[1:31:16] which father we burying them in
[1:31:20] come on don't you look at me like a
[1:31:21] bunch of geese that's the reason we call
[1:31:23] the name
[1:31:25] because our identity is in the name
[1:31:27] don't you realize
[1:31:28] that when a person is baptized in titles
[1:31:31] that is just one of those
[1:31:33] gray areas where anybody could get
[1:31:37] baptized that same way
[1:31:38] think about it pentecostal's baptized
[1:31:40] that way apostolic's baptized that way
[1:31:43] catholics baptized that way it's one of
[1:31:46] those neutral gray areas that
[1:31:48] everybody can come to meet on but it
[1:31:51] makes it a whole lot harder when you
[1:31:53] tell them
[1:31:54] you must be baptized in the name of the
[1:31:56] lord jesus christ for the remission of
[1:31:58] your sins in order to receive the holy
[1:32:00] ghost
[1:32:01] now you're getting down to a place to
[1:32:04] where that their church or organization
[1:32:05] or denomination or whatever more
[1:32:07] will not bring that identity
[1:32:10] with that name
[1:32:16] praise god well i'm having a good time
[1:32:19] hope you all are too because if not i'm
[1:32:22] going to keep on having a good time
[1:32:23] whether you like it or not so
[1:32:24] stare at me amen blink something another
[1:32:26] but just stay in here
[1:32:28] don't die okay promise just don't die
[1:32:31] just don't fall out of your chair
[1:32:33] all right now watch now brother madam
[1:32:35] says oh i love this
[1:32:36] he said he said i'll show you what's
[1:32:38] supposed to take place in this day
[1:32:40] how the son of man is to reveal himself
[1:32:42] and what he's to do all the scriptures
[1:32:43] and so forth
[1:32:44] he said and come down and identify it he
[1:32:47] said and yet you hang on to that
[1:32:48] denomination and say you're born again
[1:32:52] could you make sense out of that could i
[1:32:54] tell my wife i love her
[1:32:57] and then have a date with another woman
[1:32:59] and run around
[1:33:01] and tell her i love her from my heart
[1:33:05] what my my life identifies i don't
[1:33:08] believe what i'm saying
[1:33:10] oh praise god
[1:33:13] how could it be true genuine love if she
[1:33:16] tells me she loves me and while i'm gone
[1:33:18] away
[1:33:18] she runs around with another man he said
[1:33:21] you know that's exactly what israel done
[1:33:24] he said you set with your limbs apart
[1:33:26] and take every man to come by play the
[1:33:27] part of whoredom
[1:33:28] i put you away in divorce he said that's
[1:33:30] right committing adultery against your
[1:33:32] own body when a woman goes out there
[1:33:33] lives with another man man with a woman
[1:33:35] they're married to them they're defiling
[1:33:36] their own flesh and when a person
[1:33:39] says he is a christian listen and
[1:33:42] absolutely deny the scripture being
[1:33:45] right
[1:33:46] he's committing adultery against the
[1:33:48] body
[1:33:49] he claims to be in
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:33:54] see so it's the mark of the antichrist
[1:34:00] so part of the mark of the antichrist is
[1:34:02] those that say
[1:34:04] they're a christ lover and will not take
[1:34:06] the bible to be all it's supposed to be
[1:34:11] well you woke up some of you a few of
[1:34:16] you
[1:34:18] he said brother ben i'm tired i am too
[1:34:20] but i'm still here
[1:34:23] and i'm a lot louder than some of y'all
[1:34:25] come on i know you can do better let's
[1:34:27] go
[1:34:28] let's get with it all right now listen
[1:34:30] to me
[1:34:31] if i'm a believer
[1:34:34] what this bible says
[1:34:37] i can't just amen it i've got to
[1:34:40] manifest it
[1:34:42] are you with me all right if
[1:34:45] manifesting this word means
[1:34:48] that i've got to die to my own thoughts
[1:34:50] sometimes
[1:34:53] so be it if manifesting this bible
[1:34:58] means i've got to disagree with my
[1:35:00] training from a child
[1:35:02] so be it amen
[1:35:06] if i'm going to be a believer i must
[1:35:09] take the scripture
[1:35:11] as the absolute
[1:35:14] i'm coming somewhere and then i'm going
[1:35:16] to parachute out of here like brother
[1:35:17] jewel
[1:35:20] how can we say we're a believer whenever
[1:35:23] the only thing we've ever manifested in
[1:35:25] our life
[1:35:26] is those words i am a believer
[1:35:30] it ain't enough because if the holy
[1:35:34] ghost is present
[1:35:35] if he's resident inside of your heart
[1:35:38] you
[1:35:38] don't have to say i'm a believer
[1:35:42] christ will identify himself
[1:35:46] with you or you say well i know that do
[1:35:49] you now
[1:35:50] so when you look at that bitter feeling
[1:35:53] you've got in your heart towards
[1:35:54] somebody else
[1:35:55] or you look at that way that you think
[1:35:57] about a certain thing that you have
[1:35:59] heard a quote read a thousand times the
[1:36:00] other direction but you take your idea
[1:36:02] over it
[1:36:04] are you still a believer like you say
[1:36:05] you are
[1:36:07] you're not because when you allow
[1:36:09] yourself
[1:36:10] to be the absolute of your life and i'm
[1:36:13] telling you friends
[1:36:14] where a lot of people are coming to in
[1:36:16] this message
[1:36:18] i believe many of them especially some
[1:36:20] of these ones around the ranks of
[1:36:21] message become so stubborn
[1:36:24] i believe many of them are going to wind
[1:36:26] up in the lake of fire because they have
[1:36:28] made their own opinions
[1:36:29] the absolute of their life
[1:36:33] what they think is the bible what they
[1:36:35] think is the truth
[1:36:36] what they believe what they away with
[1:36:38] what you believe
[1:36:40] stay with what the scripture says
[1:36:44] praise god
[1:36:48] well amen and amen
[1:36:53] look you all should be shouting at this
[1:36:56] if you're a believer well brother ben
[1:37:01] yeah i know i get it i get it
[1:37:04] but i'm asking you all a serious
[1:37:05] question tonight have we settled ourself
[1:37:08] in to become identified as believers
[1:37:12] but the holy ghost has never identified
[1:37:14] himself out of us
[1:37:16] that we're believers make it over it's a
[1:37:19] good question to ask ourselves
[1:37:21] because i believe the bible i think it's
[1:37:23] right
[1:37:25] you're already missing the point
[1:37:28] you see the expression is god said so i
[1:37:30] believe it that settles it
[1:37:32] i've said it a thousand times around the
[1:37:33] world it don't matter if you believe it
[1:37:35] or not
[1:37:36] god said so that settles
[1:37:39] whoa come on doesn't matter if i believe
[1:37:43] it or not it still thus saith the lord
[1:37:47] but you see what we've done we've
[1:37:48] identified ourselves i believe it i
[1:37:51] believe it i believe it
[1:37:55] but has the lord jesus amen
[1:37:59] what you're saying if he hadn't
[1:38:02] you're still not a believer now i'm not
[1:38:06] highlighting your mistakes
[1:38:08] i'm not putting a spotlight on your
[1:38:09] misgivings or your weaknesses
[1:38:12] but there is a difference in having a
[1:38:13] weakness in your flesh or your spirit or
[1:38:16] some battle or something that you're
[1:38:17] battling there's a difference in that
[1:38:20] then knowingly and willfully allowing
[1:38:22] the devil
[1:38:24] to dominate areas of your life dominate
[1:38:27] areas of your heart and instead of you
[1:38:29] fighting it
[1:38:30] you give in to it because it's what you
[1:38:31] really want
[1:38:34] i've i've preached to women to dress
[1:38:36] white to dress right for the last 30
[1:38:38] years
[1:38:40] to be wide and clean before the lord
[1:38:43] and like brother branham every year you
[1:38:44] come back looks like they get worse
[1:38:47] you know why because deep in their heart
[1:38:49] no matter how much they say they believe
[1:38:50] this message
[1:38:52] there's a part of them that believes
[1:38:54] what they think
[1:38:56] is higher and have more authority than
[1:38:58] what the message of the bible says
[1:39:00] themselves
[1:39:01] if they didn't believe that they'd never
[1:39:02] put a pair of scissors in their hair
[1:39:03] again
[1:39:05] some man that really believed that he
[1:39:06] would never commit adultery on his wife
[1:39:09] some fellow running out there and having
[1:39:11] one night stands over and over and over
[1:39:13] again and then come back and say glory
[1:39:14] to god i love my wife she is the
[1:39:16] precious jewel of my eye you're a liar
[1:39:20] your own life testifies your love would
[1:39:24] speak
[1:39:27] now watch this in romans chapter 6 paul
[1:39:29] said what shall we say then shall we
[1:39:31] continue in sin that the grace of god
[1:39:34] may abound
[1:39:35] these are all question marks god forbid
[1:39:40] how shall we that are dead in sin live
[1:39:42] any longer therein
[1:39:43] know you not that so many of us were
[1:39:45] baptized into jesus christ
[1:39:47] were baptized into his death
[1:39:51] so you realize what that means that
[1:39:53] means if i am baptized into his death
[1:39:55] then i have to be just as dead as he was
[1:40:00] oh glory to god oh i love this
[1:40:04] therefore we buried with him in the
[1:40:05] baptism into death that like as
[1:40:08] christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:40:11] the glory of the father
[1:40:12] even so we also should walk in the
[1:40:14] newness of life
[1:40:16] so i'm dead like he was i'm resurrected
[1:40:18] like he was
[1:40:20] amen for if we've been planted together
[1:40:23] in the likeness of his death
[1:40:25] we shall also be in the likeness of his
[1:40:27] resurrection
[1:40:28] there's the problem
[1:40:33] there's the problem many of them want
[1:40:36] the likeness of the resurrection
[1:40:40] oh we're sick in our body oh jesus heal
[1:40:42] us
[1:40:44] but are you willing to die
[1:40:48] because if you want the likeness of the
[1:40:49] resurrection resurrection only comes
[1:40:51] after death
[1:40:53] come on somebody help me
[1:40:57] help me i'm trying to preach the gospel
[1:40:59] to you
[1:41:01] i want this to sink into your heart
[1:41:05] understand that if i am a genuine
[1:41:08] believer brother keith the only way i
[1:41:10] can make my
[1:41:11] my segue to resurrection
[1:41:14] is i have to come to a place to where i
[1:41:16] am so dead
[1:41:21] if you to put a scan on the mind or the
[1:41:22] body of jesus christ there wouldn't have
[1:41:24] been one function
[1:41:26] not one nerve jump his cells would have
[1:41:29] been as lifeless and still as they can
[1:41:31] be
[1:41:32] oh god that's the way you and i are
[1:41:34] going to have to come
[1:41:37] if we ever expect to walk in the
[1:41:39] resurrection power
[1:41:41] we've got to be identified that now you
[1:41:43] understand why people don't believe in
[1:41:45] altar calls much anymore
[1:41:47] oh they want everybody to come in there
[1:41:48] and they want some preacher to kick his
[1:41:50] leg about that high and
[1:41:51] dance across the platform and tell them
[1:41:53] how wonderful they are and tell them how
[1:41:54] the bride's got power and what kind of
[1:41:56] authority the bride's got
[1:41:58] yes i believe every word of that
[1:42:01] but my question is in all of that kind
[1:42:04] of preaching
[1:42:05] when has the preacher ever invited you
[1:42:07] to die
[1:42:12] die of your thoughts died of your mind
[1:42:16] die to your beliefs
[1:42:19] because the main invitation before
[1:42:21] resurrection is the invitation to die
[1:42:25] when we call for altar calls that's what
[1:42:26] we're calling for
[1:42:28] i'm inviting you to die
[1:42:31] as the father who was the dove led the
[1:42:34] lamb plum up to the cow
[1:42:35] to the crucifixion plum to calvary
[1:42:37] remember it was the dove
[1:42:39] that led the lamb had not jesus been a
[1:42:42] lamb the devil had never settled down on
[1:42:44] him
[1:42:44] his spirit was an excellent spirit a
[1:42:46] lamb-like disposition
[1:42:47] and that meant that he was agreeable
[1:42:49] with the word listen to brother brahma
[1:42:51] in 1954
[1:42:52] when he said before god can give you the
[1:42:54] holy ghost he's got to take that whole
[1:42:56] devil spirit out of you
[1:42:58] where you can agree with the word
[1:43:01] to me brother that's where the main
[1:43:04] issue
[1:43:05] really comes in we ask ourselves
[1:43:09] why don't we see revival in the church
[1:43:11] because we don't see death in it anymore
[1:43:15] i'm almost i'm almost there i'm almost
[1:43:17] there you go get your nap after this
[1:43:23] the reason they had revival in the old
[1:43:24] testament or the
[1:43:26] new testament i mean to say is because
[1:43:29] they were willing to die
[1:43:32] yeah resurrection power is only birthed
[1:43:37] from the invitation to die
[1:43:40] if i'm not willing to get down here and
[1:43:43] die out to who i am
[1:43:45] i can never manifest the power of
[1:43:47] resurrection
[1:43:49] because paul said it remember we are
[1:43:51] identified with him in his death
[1:43:53] then we are identified with him as
[1:43:54] resurrection
[1:43:59] that's power for me brother keith yes
[1:44:02] for if we've been planted together see
[1:44:05] this word i like how he says here the
[1:44:07] likeness means
[1:44:08] in the greek homie which is lightness
[1:44:11] image
[1:44:12] or such an amount well nigh to equality
[1:44:16] or identity
[1:44:20] in other words when i'm buried with him
[1:44:22] in his likeness
[1:44:23] i'm taking on the same equality i'm
[1:44:26] doing the same thing jesus christ did
[1:44:28] when he when he bowed his head in
[1:44:30] gethsemane and said none my will
[1:44:32] but thine be done i'm doing no different
[1:44:36] if i'm identified with him in his
[1:44:37] likeness then i can be identified
[1:44:41] as death i can be identified in his
[1:44:43] resurrection
[1:44:44] all right let's ask the question now why
[1:44:47] don't we see more revival amongst
[1:44:49] message believers
[1:44:52] because they're not willing to die
[1:44:55] they hold themselves into a mode
[1:45:00] and i don't know some of y'all at this
[1:45:02] church may be like this if you are
[1:45:03] tonight's a good night to get
[1:45:04] straightened out
[1:45:07] maybe some of these poor old folks on
[1:45:09] the internet are receiving all of this
[1:45:11] bless your heart for enduring through
[1:45:12] the hard stuff
[1:45:18] maybe some poor old center out there on
[1:45:20] the internet's probably having to listen
[1:45:21] to this thing right now or maybe will in
[1:45:22] a few days and say boy
[1:45:24] he spoke right to my heart i'm sure none
[1:45:26] of us probably can even identify with
[1:45:28] any of this can we
[1:45:30] have we become so angelic in our ways
[1:45:32] and so proper in our ways
[1:45:34] and so fixed up that we're christians
[1:45:36] and we're believers and there's no
[1:45:38] room for error shall look at me like
[1:45:40] everyone
[1:45:42] you see see what we've done we have
[1:45:44] taken ourselves to such a level of
[1:45:46] superiority
[1:45:48] until we've forgotten the very principle
[1:45:50] that keeps us in resurrection life
[1:45:54] oh you said well i've done diet i've got
[1:45:56] the holy ghost
[1:45:57] you're not reading the bible far enough
[1:45:59] because the same apostle paul that said
[1:46:02] this
[1:46:02] is the same apostle paul that said he
[1:46:04] didn't just die once
[1:46:07] he died daily all right
[1:46:11] here's the question do you want
[1:46:12] resurrection life every day
[1:46:15] you want resurrection power when you
[1:46:16] wake up
[1:46:18] you got to be willing to die daily
[1:46:21] you got to be willing to go to the grave
[1:46:23] every day and say god
[1:46:25] erase from my mind and my thoughts
[1:46:27] anything that is contrary
[1:46:30] to thus saith the lord because with
[1:46:32] isaiah
[1:46:33] no matter how long we've preached
[1:46:35] pastored churches running around the
[1:46:36] country missionary whatever we've done
[1:46:38] if you and i as men of god if we cannot
[1:46:41] make this word live in the way of death
[1:46:43] we'll never produce a resurrection
[1:46:45] ministry
[1:46:46] ain't no way brother troy no matter how
[1:46:48] many sermons you put together
[1:46:50] to teach the people into the truth of
[1:46:51] the word unless you're willing to die
[1:46:55] you can never produce resurrection out
[1:46:56] of what you're trying to say
[1:46:58] amen why do you think brother man was
[1:47:00] effective
[1:47:02] he was willing to die yes sir
[1:47:06] now let me let me take this last
[1:47:08] statement then let's quit
[1:47:10] i'm scared some of y'all are going to
[1:47:11] pass out on me honestly
[1:47:14] all right now now listen we buddies i
[1:47:17] can talk to you any way i want to can i
[1:47:19] amen if that don't work you can just
[1:47:21] throw rocks at each other you not run me
[1:47:23] one or the other amen
[1:47:24] you remember he told that story right he
[1:47:27] said they get in a big debate and said
[1:47:28] they couldn't solve it that way they'd
[1:47:30] throw rocks each other and that didn't
[1:47:31] work and start out running one another
[1:47:32] we'll find something watch us now
[1:47:36] brother baby talk about and identify
[1:47:37] with christ he said if i should take my
[1:47:39] text tonight for about 20 minutes
[1:47:40] i would say the identification with
[1:47:42] christ he said there is in the country
[1:47:45] today
[1:47:45] so many dissatisfied people when have
[1:47:47] you ever seen a time like what we're
[1:47:49] living right now
[1:47:50] just as dissatisfied as they can be
[1:47:52] nothing satisfies them
[1:47:54] i mean look we are sitting in the middle
[1:47:56] of a global pandemic our president
[1:47:58] dishes out trillions not billions not
[1:48:01] millions trillions of dollars
[1:48:02] and and extends the unemployment six
[1:48:06] hundred dollars extra a week for people
[1:48:09] that's more than some people make in the
[1:48:10] regular week
[1:48:13] and still they're dissatisfied
[1:48:16] oh he ain't done nothing for me oh lord
[1:48:19] what do you want him to do
[1:48:22] right everything is dissatisfication
[1:48:26] dissatisf uh uh uh uh being dissatisfied
[1:48:30] right it's amazing
[1:48:31] when you get around find so much
[1:48:32] dissatisfaction people
[1:48:34] hardly know what to do come down the
[1:48:38] road 70 80 miles an hour in a 30 mile
[1:48:40] zone slide the brakes
[1:48:41] turn a corner and start up with such
[1:48:42] speed they'll burn their tires half off
[1:48:44] and go a city block just to set and talk
[1:48:46] a while with somebody
[1:48:49] someone gets too disturbed they go to
[1:48:51] the drug store and purchase a bottle of
[1:48:52] arsenic sulfuric acid or something
[1:48:54] commit suicide
[1:48:55] find them laying dead some will turn
[1:48:57] their gas jets on in the room
[1:49:00] put their automobiles with their pipe
[1:49:01] the carbon monoxide gas trying to get
[1:49:03] away from life
[1:49:04] some will climb a bridge write a little
[1:49:06] note stick it to their coat lay it down
[1:49:08] plunge himself to death in the river
[1:49:10] jumping off mountains high towers some
[1:49:12] will take a pistol put it to their head
[1:49:14] blow their brains out
[1:49:15] dissatisfied the hospitals are just full
[1:49:18] of dissatisfied people
[1:49:19] the insane institutions are overrun
[1:49:22] they don't know what they want
[1:49:26] they seem watch us now they seem to be
[1:49:28] reaching
[1:49:29] after something but they never come to
[1:49:32] it
[1:49:36] because don't you realize what's
[1:49:37] happening
[1:49:39] they're trying to find that ultimate
[1:49:42] condition of victory
[1:49:45] but they're skipping the most important
[1:49:47] element
[1:49:50] to come to the altar and die
[1:49:55] that's why they're unhappy
[1:49:59] i'm doing research for a book that i'm
[1:50:01] writing
[1:50:02] it's not a message book it's a it's a
[1:50:05] it's a secular book i'm writing with a
[1:50:06] fellow colleague
[1:50:07] another doctor and
[1:50:11] part of the research that we're doing is
[1:50:13] on happiness and what makes people happy
[1:50:16] boy i picked a good subject to talk on
[1:50:18] tonight
[1:50:20] well some of you are smiling so i guess
[1:50:22] you're still in there with me
[1:50:24] and i read a study that i thought was
[1:50:27] profound
[1:50:28] i just just just amazed me when i read
[1:50:30] it
[1:50:32] and what they said in there is they
[1:50:33] found out that of a person who made more
[1:50:35] money
[1:50:36] maybe in their mind they thought well i
[1:50:38] make 60 000 a year if i could only make
[1:50:40] 100 a year
[1:50:41] i'd truly be happy so they'd done
[1:50:44] surveys and they'd done interviews and
[1:50:46] things and took
[1:50:47] you know collected all kinds of
[1:50:48] information and
[1:50:51] they found out that only the time the
[1:50:53] only time that money ever made somebody
[1:50:55] happy
[1:50:56] is when it was bringing them out of
[1:50:57] poverty every other time
[1:51:01] they adapted to what they were making
[1:51:04] and their happiness lasted so
[1:51:06] long and then they become dissatisfied
[1:51:08] with where they were at
[1:51:11] they said the same thing about an
[1:51:12] automobile some of us as i was talking
[1:51:14] about that car this morning right
[1:51:16] we'd think to ourselves man if i could
[1:51:18] get one of them automobiles i'd be so
[1:51:20] happy you know what they proved
[1:51:21] they proved you get your car and about
[1:51:24] six months when the news starts wearing
[1:51:25] off it
[1:51:26] you become dissatisfied with your
[1:51:28] purchase
[1:51:30] it goes to prove what i'm trying to say
[1:51:32] to you is the world has looked for a way
[1:51:36] to find resurrection victory
[1:51:38] resurrection stamina
[1:51:39] resurrection power resurrection life
[1:51:43] but they failed to come the way that
[1:51:45] needs to come which is to be identified
[1:51:49] in the death and the burial of jesus
[1:51:52] christ
[1:51:54] without that there is no mark 16.
[1:51:57] without that there is no saint john 14.
[1:52:00] without that there is no resurrection in
[1:52:02] life come on somebody
[1:52:04] you've actually got to die
[1:52:08] if you skip this i don't care how much
[1:52:11] you say you believe the message or how
[1:52:12] much you say brother
[1:52:13] is a prophet you skipped that you have
[1:52:16] lost your identity and there's no way
[1:52:19] you can be a true christian
[1:52:21] without this why do you all reckon we
[1:52:24] take you to the river and bury you in
[1:52:26] the first place
[1:52:27] because you're supposed to be dead
[1:52:29] that's why we don't sprinkle you
[1:52:31] we don't take corpses and take them to
[1:52:33] the front and sprinkle a little dirt on
[1:52:34] them and call that buried
[1:52:36] we put them all the way under the ground
[1:52:39] amen i was out baptized in october one
[1:52:41] time in ohio and you know that ohio
[1:52:42] weather's bitter
[1:52:44] and man i'm telling you i was numb from
[1:52:47] the waist down
[1:52:48] and me and this brother we had this boy
[1:52:50] he weighed four and a quarter i'm not
[1:52:51] kidding you he was the biggest human
[1:52:53] being i'd ever laid my hands on
[1:52:55] this old boy he got in the water just
[1:52:57] give his heart to the lord you know
[1:52:59] and and i said all right we're going to
[1:53:01] baptize you i think his name was fred i
[1:53:02] said fred you ready he said i'm ready
[1:53:05] i put his back in that water he's a
[1:53:07] bodybuilder you know i'm talking he's
[1:53:08] fat until he's a bodybuilder
[1:53:10] and i put him down his back touch that
[1:53:12] water and that big strong guy that could
[1:53:14] pick the back end of a truck he let out
[1:53:16] a squeal sound like a sister
[1:53:18] and he'd come out of that water ew he
[1:53:21] said did he come out of that thing
[1:53:23] i didn't know what to do as one of my
[1:53:24] first baptisms and a preacher said
[1:53:26] you ain't buried him until you put him
[1:53:28] all the way under the dirt
[1:53:32] we had to almost get up and jump on top
[1:53:34] of that guy to get him under the water
[1:53:35] he about froze to death and we did too
[1:53:40] point i'm making to you is that this is
[1:53:41] the reason we baptize and identify
[1:53:44] yourself in the name of jesus christ
[1:53:46] because what you do there at the river
[1:53:48] is what you're going to do the rest of
[1:53:49] your life
[1:53:52] you're going to bury yourself again and
[1:53:53] again and again and again and again
[1:53:56] the moment that that cycle of death
[1:53:58] stops in your walk with god that's the
[1:54:00] moment resurrection life quits as well
[1:54:03] and now you can see why so many people
[1:54:05] in the message are dissatisfied
[1:54:07] listen listen to me brother isaiah and i
[1:54:10] both been preaching a long time
[1:54:11] we've seen it all ain't nothing any all
[1:54:14] could tell us it would surprise us
[1:54:16] well i don't know but i mean
[1:54:19] it would take a lot i've seen people
[1:54:22] come and sit down on the fuse
[1:54:24] and i preached until
[1:54:27] my insides felt like they were getting
[1:54:30] ready to
[1:54:31] fall out of my nose i was preaching so
[1:54:33] hard
[1:54:34] stand up and scream and holler and beat
[1:54:36] the pews and
[1:54:37] cut on somebody and drag him as many way
[1:54:40] i could drag him
[1:54:41] nothing i did seem to satisfy him
[1:54:44] you know what the problem is friends the
[1:54:47] problem is we don't come to church we
[1:54:49] don't read our bible we don't serve the
[1:54:51] lord with this attitude of death
[1:54:54] we serve god too alive god don't want
[1:54:57] living christians
[1:54:59] he want dead ones that he can put his
[1:55:02] life and his power into
[1:55:06] you can't get people to motivate to do
[1:55:07] anything i've learned a long time
[1:55:09] you can't make nobody do nothing i know
[1:55:11] i've tried
[1:55:14] i've drug them in pulled them in
[1:55:16] screamed at them
[1:55:17] hollered get right with todd you don't
[1:55:19] do no good
[1:55:20] if you set up a volleyball game and that
[1:55:22] entices them to come to church
[1:55:24] then the next badminton tournament comes
[1:55:26] along drags them out
[1:55:29] or some tennis game or some foolishness
[1:55:30] like that
[1:55:32] you know they say well do something for
[1:55:34] our young people yes i believe all that
[1:55:36] too we should do something for the young
[1:55:38] people but let me tell you it's going to
[1:55:39] take more than a hot dog roast to get
[1:55:41] them right with god
[1:55:44] they need a roast all right but ain't
[1:55:45] got nothing to do with hot dogs
[1:55:49] it's laying at the altar of god dying
[1:55:54] that should be our true identity
[1:55:58] being willing to die so that we can
[1:56:00] resurrect
[1:56:02] i promise you i was going to quit i'm
[1:56:04] i'm done let me say one last thing
[1:56:06] before we
[1:56:08] sorry start to sing here i want to read
[1:56:10] you this one last statement
[1:56:12] let's listen to this what brother brown
[1:56:13] said it's beautiful statement he makes
[1:56:14] here
[1:56:16] he said would you it said it would just
[1:56:18] seem that there's no satisfaction
[1:56:20] he said but what makes them do it is for
[1:56:22] a cause it's a nature
[1:56:24] god gave them that nature and the nature
[1:56:26] is they may not have something to
[1:56:27] identify themselves with so i can't
[1:56:30] throw off on anybody that wants to be a
[1:56:31] cowboy or wants to be a
[1:56:33] radio star or basketball star it's part
[1:56:35] of
[1:56:36] man's nature to want to identify himself
[1:56:40] but listen brother brennaman said but
[1:56:41] the reason they're doing it
[1:56:44] is because there's something in there
[1:56:47] that god made them that god made them an
[1:56:51] example to be identified
[1:56:52] and then when he jesus became your
[1:56:56] your savior listen to these words oh i
[1:56:59] know message people don't like this kind
[1:57:00] of preaching these days
[1:57:02] but this is the word of god that will
[1:57:03] save us
[1:57:06] he said when jesus became your savior
[1:57:09] that's
[1:57:11] the example i i know
[1:57:14] i know i know be still old faithful
[1:57:17] message people
[1:57:18] erupters we're supposed to be like
[1:57:22] brother banham was where'd he say that
[1:57:26] he said the example was jesus christ
[1:57:30] how death burial
[1:57:33] and resurrection but frank if i can't be
[1:57:37] identified
[1:57:38] that way i am not a
[1:57:41] believer
[1:57:45] the first step to anything is coming up
[1:57:50] and dying
[1:57:53] and dying
[1:57:58] finishing out he said god made a man a
[1:58:00] desire to have an example
[1:58:03] and god gave him that example
[1:58:08] if we would be more like try to be more
[1:58:10] like him there wouldn't be so many big
[1:58:12] shots in the world
[1:58:17] preach brother branham
[1:58:20] oh you know big shot is you know a big
[1:58:22] shot's just a little shot far away from
[1:58:23] home though
[1:58:26] sure i've been in the message this many
[1:58:29] years ah
[1:58:30] what would brother branham
[1:58:33] yeah but if i would take his example
[1:58:37] if i would live that example i wouldn't
[1:58:40] walk around like a big shot
[1:58:43] if i knew that facing me the next day
[1:58:45] was another calvary
[1:58:48] i'd be like he was father not my will
[1:58:53] but then be done god gave us an example
[1:58:57] to be identified with
[1:59:00] and that example was jesus christ
[1:59:04] he said we'd be more like that there
[1:59:05] wouldn't be hungry children in the world
[1:59:07] there wouldn't be whiskey drinking
[1:59:08] gambling
[1:59:09] imagine that god gave us an example but
[1:59:11] we refuse to be that that's what's the
[1:59:13] matter with the world
[1:59:16] now look how deep this runs this don't
[1:59:18] run to just believers with isaiah
[1:59:19] but this runs to the world the fact that
[1:59:23] the world is not willing to die do you
[1:59:25] understand that if the world would get
[1:59:28] serious with god
[1:59:29] corona and all cancers and everything
[1:59:30] that would be a thing of the past in 24
[1:59:32] hours
[1:59:35] because you get a bunch of believers
[1:59:36] joining together like that
[1:59:38] and somebody said to me one time said
[1:59:40] they're going to send us up to alaska
[1:59:42] and
[1:59:42] lock us in cages i said my god that'd be
[1:59:45] the dumbest thing they've ever done
[1:59:47] if they sent a bunch of believers off to
[1:59:48] alaska we'd take that spoken word power
[1:59:51] bind together and it'd be hawaii
[1:59:56] overnight
[1:59:58] god
[2:00:01] but god give us the example of what
[2:00:03] we're supposed to have
[2:00:05] that example is brother man said like
[2:00:06] this he said
[2:00:08] get facing calvary he said
[2:00:12] get facing calvary get on the road
[2:00:16] facing calvary
[2:00:20] all right i'm done i'm done i'm done
[2:00:22] we're done
[2:00:24] you want to be a believer every day of
[2:00:27] your life
[2:00:29] you have to get facing on a road to
[2:00:32] calvary
[2:00:36] if we don't have that we're not a
[2:00:39] believer
[2:00:43] i would ask you to close your eyes but
[2:00:44] i'm afraid some of y'all would pass out
[2:00:45] and fall asleep sure
[2:00:46] for them stand with me
[2:00:54] listen i know you all can do better than
[2:00:55] this
[2:00:57] you can worship a lot better than what
[2:00:58] y'all been doing tonight i know you can
[2:01:02] and i wouldn't be a good friend if i let
[2:01:04] you just sit there look at me like a
[2:01:05] baptist would i
[2:01:09] now listen listen folks
[2:01:12] i want to say one last thing god help me
[2:01:15] as a christian
[2:01:16] that's my prayer god help me as a
[2:01:18] christian
[2:01:20] to not so much seek for lord
[2:01:23] i'd like to cast out devils lord
[2:01:26] i'd like to have spoken word power lord
[2:01:28] i'd like to
[2:01:30] no no that'll take care of itself
[2:01:33] if i go back here
[2:01:36] and say lord i come to die today
[2:01:41] are you with me i come to give my life
[2:01:44] to you
[2:01:46] you see that down there will take care
[2:01:48] of itself it's kind of like all this
[2:01:50] plugged up here these lights i could
[2:01:53] stand up here and say
[2:01:54] oh god i want to shine the brightest oh
[2:01:56] god i want to illuminate this oh god i
[2:01:59] want to show
[2:02:00] but if i'll just simply walk back here
[2:02:03] and touch that switch
[2:02:05] the rest of this will take care of
[2:02:06] itself i got to go to the source
[2:02:11] we talk about manifested sons
[2:02:15] of god don't we we talk about a power of
[2:02:18] god that's going to come into the church
[2:02:20] or she's going to turn hell upside down
[2:02:22] we believe that
[2:02:24] wait a minute wait a minute
[2:02:28] how are we going to get to that if we're
[2:02:31] not willing to go back to the beginning
[2:02:34] and come here and die the biggest
[2:02:37] problem is too much of us still
[2:02:39] lives still as too much of us
[2:02:42] is alive yeah
[2:02:46] god help me help me die
[2:02:49] help me come to the place of the cross
[2:02:51] because see that cross represents
[2:02:54] two roads you know remember when brother
[2:02:56] brown billy paul tells the story how
[2:02:58] that
[2:02:58] when he was out in the world and things
[2:03:00] had come in one night relate brother i
[2:03:01] made him hold his arms i said billy
[2:03:03] you're going this way
[2:03:04] he said but this is your right road here
[2:03:06] he said now the farther back you get he
[2:03:08] said the harder it is to come back this
[2:03:10] way
[2:03:11] you see that cross represents a cross it
[2:03:14] could be one direction could be another
[2:03:16] [Music]
[2:03:18] why do you think after 30 years 40 years
[2:03:22] people don't just wake up and decide
[2:03:24] well
[2:03:25] brother brown's a false prophet he's
[2:03:28] nothing but a liar
[2:03:30] i can't believe nothing he ever said he
[2:03:32] lied about half of everything he told us
[2:03:35] people just wake up and do such things
[2:03:37] as that
[2:03:39] you think some man just wakes up in the
[2:03:40] bed next to a woman he's committed
[2:03:42] adultery with
[2:03:43] just wakes up there he is
[2:03:47] something takes place
[2:03:50] they stop dying they stop giving
[2:03:53] themself and surrendering themselves to
[2:03:55] the lord
[2:03:56] when that happens then all of the good
[2:03:59] things that come from the light being on
[2:04:02] oh you said that's a simple example sure
[2:04:05] it is
[2:04:06] don't forget what brother brad told us
[2:04:07] at the end of his ministry
[2:04:09] that we the bride this world would come
[2:04:12] to such a dark hour
[2:04:13] that even the elective would be scared
[2:04:17] that little sister be screaming out
[2:04:19] terror she wasn't just oh oh oh i'm
[2:04:21] scared she's
[2:04:22] ah
[2:04:25] and that brother hollered out don't
[2:04:27] worry little sister
[2:04:29] there is a man that can turn on the line
[2:04:31] but you know what he's trying to tell us
[2:04:33] he's trying to tell us to get there
[2:04:35] there's a place we gotta go
[2:04:38] let's back to calvary
[2:04:42] amen let's pray together
[2:04:49] heavenly father
[2:04:53] lord i know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[2:04:56] this kind of preaching lord isn't always
[2:04:58] the most popular
[2:05:01] as a matter of fact lord this isn't the
[2:05:04] kind of sermon that people would welcome
[2:05:05] in big conventions
[2:05:08] they wouldn't want it at the key point
[2:05:09] the high point of a meeting
[2:05:13] but lord to me this kind of preaching
[2:05:15] reminds us of
[2:05:16] when you took your disciples in the side
[2:05:18] room and you just sat and talked to them
[2:05:19] a while
[2:05:21] you spoke things there that the rest of
[2:05:24] them didn't get to hear on the outside
[2:05:27] heavenly father i'll make this as brief
[2:05:30] as i can lord
[2:05:32] i'm praying you'll help us each one of
[2:05:34] us
[2:05:35] to learn the art of dying
[2:05:40] on a daily basis help us god to come to
[2:05:44] the place
[2:05:46] to where we can die
[2:05:50] oh god before we can speak
[2:05:54] before we can live before we can
[2:05:56] manifest
[2:05:58] we've got to learn to die oh god when we
[2:06:02] get there
[2:06:03] everything else will take care of itself
[2:06:06] help us lord each one in jesus name
[2:06:11] now with your heads bowed to him would
[2:06:13] you like to raise your hand up to the
[2:06:14] lord and say brother ben
[2:06:16] i i i believe that's the truth and i i
[2:06:19] need help with it
[2:06:20] i need the lord to help me learn how to
[2:06:23] die
[2:06:25] hallelujah hallelujah just hold your
[2:06:29] request there
[2:06:30] before the lord now and just as we sing
[2:06:33] worship a little bit i want you just to
[2:06:36] hold that before the lord and just tell
[2:06:37] him
[2:06:38] god from here on out i want to learn how
[2:06:40] to die
[2:06:42] i want to learn how to be a real
[2:06:45] born-again christian not somebody that
[2:06:47] just
[2:06:48] believes in the message just holds on to
[2:06:51] message quotes but god
[2:06:53] i want to really learn how to die
[2:06:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:07:01] amen key of chi brother let's sing
[2:07:02] together
[2:07:04] that little song in
[2:07:11] the cross
[2:07:29] oh god
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:52] restless
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:08:06] gross
[2:08:20] i
[2:08:33] is this your prayer is this your
[2:08:35] testimony

[2:08:42] if you'll apply it
[2:08:44] to your life i'm telling you in christ's

[2:08:54] powers of god like you never dream is
[2:08:56] possible
[2:08:57] it may come subtle at first it may come
[2:08:59] little by little
[2:09:00] but if you'll take what i preached to
[2:09:02] tonight and apply it to your life
[2:09:05] watch and see if change it's the same
[2:09:08] principle as planting a seed
[2:09:10] once the seed goes in the ground there's
[2:09:12] a germ there's a law
[2:09:14] and it will break forth god bless you

[2:09:31] be christians
