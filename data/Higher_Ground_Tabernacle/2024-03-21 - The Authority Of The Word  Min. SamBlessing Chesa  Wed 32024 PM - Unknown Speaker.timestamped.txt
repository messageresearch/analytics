[46:40] rejuvenated amen whilst we are

[47:00] grace Heavenly Father we thank you for
[47:03] bringing us in your household
[47:06] God we didn't come to see one
[47:11] another but we have come to see your
[47:13] face we have come to hear from you
[47:17] Lord now Lord we have our ears
[47:21] opened we have our hearts open oh God
[47:24] may you speak your word to us
[47:28] may you speak through the speaker
[47:31] Lord and may you hear
[47:36] through through the hearer oh
[47:38] God lord as we are opening your
[47:42] word any man can read these
[47:45] words but it's only yourself who can
[47:47] give action unto those words oh
[47:50] God and when we know when we receive
[47:52] your
[47:53] word it might be activated within us
[47:58] so it might be living word in our lives
[48:00] oh
[48:01] God we ask you in this place oh
[48:05] God we know you already
[48:08] here I just pray oh God you have full
[48:11] preeminence do what you do oh
[48:14] God in Jesus name I pray
[48:18] believing
[48:19] amen am while we standing L us read uh
[48:22] Genesis chapter 1 and verse
[48:25] one
[48:27] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[48:29] and the
[48:32] Earth and the Earth was without
[48:35] form and void and darkness was upon the
[48:39] face of the
[48:42] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[48:45] their face of the
[48:48] waters and God said let there be
[48:51] light and there was light may the Lord
[48:55] add blessings to the reading of his word
[48:59] we can take our
[49:01] seats in the beginning God created the
[49:04] Heaven and the
[49:06] Earth he created the Heaven and the
[49:08] Earth by speaking the
[49:11] word he says let there be
[49:14] light and there was light amen amen each
[49:18] and everything attribute of creation
[49:21] that we
[49:23] see was created by the spoken word
[49:28] amen so this evening we were speaking on
[49:29] the authority of the
[49:32] word amen amen so the words that God
[49:37] spoke let there be
[49:40] light had enough
[49:43] authority to bring light into
[49:47] place the word that he
[49:49] spoke had enough
[49:52] power to move the Earth away from the
[49:55] waters
[49:59] with the spoken
[50:00] word he was able to hang and uh design
[50:04] the whole solar system and the
[50:10] planets even till today right the stars
[50:14] are hanging in
[50:17] there the Moon is hanging where it's
[50:21] hanging Jupiter is hanging where it's
[50:24] hanging because of the spoken
[50:28] word so however many millions of years
[50:31] have
[50:33] passed that word still
[50:36] works that word still has Authority it
[50:39] has
[50:41] power amen amen so if it can work for
[50:44] the solar
[50:46] system it can work for you and me this
[50:50] evening amen amen and in John chapter 1
[50:53] and verse
[50:55] one the Bible say says in the beginning
[50:58] was the
[50:59] word and the Word was with
[51:03] God and the Word was
[51:06] God Amen am the same was in the
[51:09] beginning with
[51:11] God which was the word and all things
[51:16] were made by
[51:18] him and without him was not anything
[51:21] made that was
[51:24] made amen amen I was looking at it in
[51:27] the other uh version of the
[51:30] Bible the one that is a Greek
[51:34] translation it says in the beginning was
[51:36] the
[51:38] logos and the prophet of God tells us
[51:40] that the logos is the Son of
[51:43] God in the beginning was the son of
[51:47] God and the Son of God was the
[51:50] word amen it says and the logos was with
[51:55] God and the logos was
[51:58] God so the word the logos and
[52:03] God they are
[52:05] one amen amen this was in the beginning
[52:08] with
[52:10] God through it everything was
[52:14] done and with without it not even one
[52:18] thing was
[52:21] done which has been
[52:23] done amen amen so in the beginning was
[52:26] the
[52:28] Loos in the beginning was
[52:31] God in the beginning was the
[52:34] word and that word was responsible for
[52:39] creating each and everything that we
[52:42] seeing so we realize the words have
[52:47] power amen the Bible in Proverbs says
[52:50] death and life are in the power of the
[52:55] tongue so you got to be careful what you
[52:58] talk about
[53:02] yourself you got to be careful what you
[53:04] tell your loved ones around
[53:07] you you think you might be just speaking
[53:10] words but those words have
[53:14] power someone has an insecurity
[53:18] today because of a word they were told
[53:20] when they were 10 years
[53:23] old cuz that stuck with them
[53:27] and that word worked on
[53:30] them and they probably developed a
[53:32] certain
[53:34] complex because a person told them
[53:39] something so if the word of a
[53:42] man can do that to one of to uh to
[53:48] us what about when God speaks his word
[53:51] over your your
[53:55] life it ought to change
[53:57] you it ought to transform you it ought
[54:01] to turn you
[54:03] around when you take it and you believe
[54:07] it so you better be careful what you say
[54:10] about
[54:13] yourself don't say negative things about
[54:19] yourself do God say about
[54:23] me you say the word of the Lord says I'm
[54:25] more than a
[54:28] conqueror take that
[54:30] word personalize
[54:33] it and speak it for
[54:36] yourself and you say I am more than a
[54:40] conqueror amen nowadays they have what
[54:42] they call
[54:45] affirmations people affirm to themselves
[54:48] with a lot of different
[54:51] things and they able to succeed in
[54:55] life it's not even the word of
[54:59] God what more if you affirm yourself
[55:03] what if if you affirm
[55:05] yourself with the word of God Amen I can
[55:10] do all things through
[55:13] Christ who strengthens
[55:15] me I know God is
[55:18] able to do what he said he will do in my
[55:21] life
[55:23] am hallelujah hallelujah so every
[55:25] morning we wake wake
[55:27] up read your
[55:29] word during the day when you have
[55:32] time read that
[55:34] word before going to bed read the word
[55:39] why because the word has
[55:41] power the word has
[55:43] Authority where does the word get its
[55:46] Authority
[55:47] from remember the word is the Son of
[55:50] God the word is the
[55:54] Loos the word is God
[55:57] himself amen the angel when the angel of
[56:01] the Lord appeared to
[56:04] Joshua it told him if you want to be
[56:08] successful do not deviate from the words
[56:11] of
[56:13] Moses it says meditate upon
[56:17] it day and night and you shall be
[56:21] successful amen and that was in the
[56:24] first Exodus in the Third Exodus we had
[56:27] our Moses
[56:30] too if you meditate on those
[56:34] words if you meditate on the word of
[56:37] God meditate on the
[56:40] Bible meditate on those
[56:43] States you are bound to
[56:46] succeed because God never
[56:50] fails God is not a man that he should
[56:53] lie but whenever he speaks
[56:57] things have to happen he can speak
[57:00] Darkness out of your
[57:02] life amen he can speak depression out of
[57:05] your
[57:07] life amen because the word has
[57:12] power and we realize that the word
[57:15] carries the same
[57:19] Authority as the same as the person who
[57:22] spoke
[57:25] it
[57:26] when you are being
[57:28] sent and someone comes to tell you and
[57:32] says did you hear that you're supposed
[57:34] to go do this and
[57:38] that the first question you ask is
[57:41] uh who say
[57:43] that the answer to who said
[57:47] that is going to determine the urg at
[57:50] which you're going to carry out that
[57:55] task
[57:56] if you are at
[57:58] home if you at home and you hear that
[58:01] your older brother has sent
[58:04] you or your older
[58:06] sister like okay I'll do it in my in my
[58:09] extra
[58:11] time but when you hear that is Dad or
[58:14] Mom you you got to stop what you're
[58:17] doing and you have to go do
[58:20] it because the words that have been
[58:23] spoken carries the same Authority
[58:27] as the person who has spoken those
[58:31] words amen am so when God speaks the
[58:35] word it's a different situation
[58:39] altoe amen that's the same word that was
[58:43] able to create
[58:46] everything scientists called it the the
[58:49] Earth was created by the big bang big
[58:51] bang
[58:55] theory
[58:58] by some chemical
[59:01] reactions they got the big bang part
[59:06] correct but they don't realize the
[59:09] explosion was caused by the spoken
[59:14] word when God
[59:16] spoke everything had to explode and go
[59:19] into the place it
[59:23] was because in Isaiah
[59:26] it says so shall shall be my
[59:31] word that goeth forth out of my
[59:34] mouth it shall not return unto me
[59:40] void but it shall accomplish that which
[59:42] I
[59:45] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[59:48] where to I sent
[59:50] it so when God speaks a
[59:54] word it does not come come back to him
[59:58] vo but it only comes back to
[1:00:01] him after it has
[1:00:05] accomplished that which he has spoken it
[1:00:09] for so in the beginning when he said let
[1:00:12] there be
[1:00:13] light that word was not going to return
[1:00:16] to
[1:00:18] him until light was
[1:00:22] there when he created the Grand Canyon
[1:00:25] with the spoken
[1:00:28] word when he created nagara Falls with
[1:00:31] the
[1:00:33] word that word was not going to go back
[1:00:36] to
[1:00:38] him until the purpose which he spoke it
[1:00:43] for was
[1:00:45] accomplished amen amen so if the law
[1:00:48] enforcement
[1:00:50] that words from the law enforcement have
[1:00:54] authority
[1:00:56] words from the governor they have
[1:00:59] authority words from the president have
[1:01:03] authority but none of that matches the
[1:01:05] authority of the almighty
[1:01:10] God so when you are reading the
[1:01:13] Bible when you are listening to the word
[1:01:16] you better realize you are not listening
[1:01:18] to empty
[1:01:21] words you are listening to words that
[1:01:23] have
[1:01:24] power
[1:01:26] power to change
[1:01:28] you amen power to work for whatever you
[1:01:31] wanted to work for
[1:01:34] you amen amen when Abraham and Sarah
[1:01:37] were told that they were going to have a
[1:01:39] a
[1:01:41] son they believed it it took them 25
[1:01:47] years but because God had
[1:01:51] spoken it had to come to
[1:01:53] pass Isaac had to come one one way or
[1:01:56] the
[1:01:59] other Abraham was 100 years
[1:02:02] old Sarah 75 years
[1:02:09] old biologically that was
[1:02:13] impossible the doctors will tell you
[1:02:15] that's
[1:02:18] impossible for a barren
[1:02:21] woman who is now
[1:02:24] old all the odds were stacked against
[1:02:29] her and she was not physically
[1:02:35] capable to
[1:02:38] conceive and later on give
[1:02:41] birth but because the word of God was
[1:02:46] spoken that child had to
[1:02:49] come amen am and the prophet of God
[1:02:52] tells
[1:02:53] us that Abraham and Sarah before they
[1:02:56] gave they had
[1:03:01] Isaac they became young
[1:03:04] again that's why lasted after
[1:03:12] Sarah he could not last after a 75y old
[1:03:18] woman how did they
[1:03:20] change the spoken word that was
[1:03:24] spoken was resp responsible to change
[1:03:27] them and condition them to receive the
[1:03:31] promise of
[1:03:33] God so when you read the word of
[1:03:36] God and you see that you are not in the
[1:03:40] condition that promise to come to
[1:03:44] you do not
[1:03:46] worry keep on holding on to that
[1:03:49] word because that
[1:03:51] word is
[1:03:54] responsible to transform you to
[1:03:58] condition you for you to be able to
[1:04:01] receive that
[1:04:02] promise it does not matter how long it
[1:04:05] takes it's coming any
[1:04:09] anyway am one way or the other I know it
[1:04:13] is
[1:04:14] coming hallelujah hallelujah sir amen so
[1:04:18] we got to believe God's
[1:04:20] word when he says by my stps you were
[1:04:24] healed start already saying I'm
[1:04:28] Healed if you have
[1:04:32] diabetes take that word you say I don't
[1:04:35] know how that's going to
[1:04:37] happen I don't know how that's going to
[1:04:40] leave I just know I'm going to be
[1:04:43] healed because the word of God
[1:04:45] Says by his
[1:04:48] stries I was
[1:04:50] healed when he was hanging on that
[1:04:53] cross and he cried it is
[1:04:56] finished that word was
[1:04:59] spoken so it will not go back to
[1:05:02] him until whatever you are going through
[1:05:05] is
[1:05:08] finished amenu until your problem is
[1:05:13] finished that word is not going
[1:05:16] back amen when Jesus was walking on the
[1:05:20] shores of
[1:05:21] Galilee on the streets of
[1:05:24] Jerusalem lay man
[1:05:28] walked blind eyes were
[1:05:31] open why because he was the
[1:05:35] word that was made
[1:05:37] flesh so when he was
[1:05:40] speaking he was speaking with
[1:05:44] authority when he says rise up and
[1:05:47] walk he was speaking with authority of
[1:05:51] God because God is the
[1:05:53] word and the logos is the
[1:05:56] word and the word is the
[1:05:59] logos and that's Jesus
[1:06:01] Christ amen amen so you got to take it
[1:06:04] for
[1:06:06] yourself believe it and be like
[1:06:10] Mary and say so be it unto
[1:06:14] me according to Thy
[1:06:17] word it does not matter how bizarre that
[1:06:21] sounds Mary was told by an
[1:06:24] Angel that you shall conceive and have a
[1:06:28] baby she's like in my whole time of
[1:06:30] going to
[1:06:32] school I've never heard I've never heard
[1:06:35] of a woman giving birth without meeting
[1:06:37] with a
[1:06:39] man but she says because this is the
[1:06:42] word from
[1:06:44] God I'm believing it let it be unto
[1:06:49] me according to your word if he did that
[1:06:53] for
[1:06:53] Mary and if you do the same thing and
[1:06:57] say Lord whatever you are saying for
[1:07:00] me be it unto me according to your
[1:07:03] word you are able to get the same
[1:07:09] results but unlike Mary we are not
[1:07:11] supposed to carry the
[1:07:17] word we are supposed to become the
[1:07:22] word that's a little higher calling than
[1:07:25] carry
[1:07:28] because we are supposed to be married to
[1:07:30] the word
[1:07:33] groom so the the bride has to become the
[1:07:37] word the groom was the word made
[1:07:41] flesh so he could come and fellowship
[1:07:44] with us the
[1:07:46] bride but after fellowshipping with us
[1:07:49] the
[1:07:50] bride the bride who is the
[1:07:53] flesh has to become the word
[1:07:56] so they can be
[1:07:58] United so we can be
[1:08:01] United with our groom
[1:08:03] amen hallelujah hallelujah God's word
[1:08:06] never
[1:08:08] fails when the word is
[1:08:10] spoken things got to happen so each and
[1:08:14] every scripture in the
[1:08:16] Bible it has enough
[1:08:19] power to come to
[1:08:21] pass it has enough
[1:08:24] power to manifest itself in your
[1:08:28] life amen when the word of God
[1:08:32] Says angels en campus those that fear
[1:08:36] the
[1:08:38] lord that's a
[1:08:40] promise so if you believe it and if you
[1:08:44] fear the
[1:08:46] lord it is
[1:08:49] guaranteed that you have Angels around
[1:08:53] you Hallelujah Hallelujah I heard this
[1:08:56] one
[1:08:57] testimony of this one sister she used to
[1:09:01] uh go to uh church every
[1:09:04] uh evening service
[1:09:07] so she used she used to walk and pass
[1:09:09] through the
[1:09:13] bush in a dangerous
[1:09:16] area and people knew that if you walk by
[1:09:19] this area by
[1:09:21] yourself you getting you getting robbed
[1:09:24] and you're getting murdered
[1:09:28] and this sister has been going to church
[1:09:30] for so many
[1:09:33] years and nothing ever happened to
[1:09:37] him one time one day this gentleman
[1:09:40] approached the
[1:09:44] sister and they said tell
[1:09:47] us every time you are coming from
[1:09:51] church who is that giant who's walking
[1:09:54] with you
[1:09:57] she says I don't know what you're
[1:09:58] talking
[1:09:58] about I just go by
[1:10:01] myself like no you were lying you always
[1:10:03] walking with a
[1:10:05] man amen that's why those murderers
[1:10:07] couldn't get to
[1:10:09] her because she feared the
[1:10:12] Lord the Angels surrounded her
[1:10:16] Hallelujah so wherever you
[1:10:19] go you have a host of angels with
[1:10:22] you because God's word never fails
[1:10:26] you remember the story of
[1:10:32] elah his eyes were
[1:10:35] closed and he could not see and he's
[1:10:38] wondering why is El elishah
[1:10:44] relaxed but he his eyes were
[1:10:48] open he was seeing something else
[1:10:51] different from what Gaz was
[1:10:52] [Music]
[1:10:54] seeing and then he prayed and says
[1:10:58] Lord Open the Eyes of the young
[1:11:01] man and as soon as his eyes were
[1:11:04] open he stopped being
[1:11:07] jittery because he saw that they were
[1:11:14] surrounded by a bigger
[1:11:17] Entourage than the enemies who were
[1:11:19] coming for
[1:11:21] them amen so I pray this evening
[1:11:25] God to open our eyes of
[1:11:28] faith our eyes of
[1:11:31] understanding so we can know that Satan
[1:11:35] cannot put his dirty hands on
[1:11:38] you because you have a greater
[1:11:41] surrounding around
[1:11:43] you God's hedge of
[1:11:48] angels Satan went to
[1:11:51] God and says look at job
[1:11:57] and God
[1:11:58] says job will never forsake
[1:12:01] me you will never stop worshiping
[1:12:05] me then Satan said
[1:12:08] well how can he not worship you when you
[1:12:12] when you have protection when you have a
[1:12:14] hedge around
[1:12:19] him how did Satan
[1:12:22] know that job had a around
[1:12:27] him before he went to
[1:12:30] God it means he went to job
[1:12:35] earlier to try to get to
[1:12:39] him but he could not because there was a
[1:12:44] hedge so he had to return
[1:12:47] back to the person who put the
[1:12:51] H ask for permission to get to Jo
[1:12:57] that's when God was like
[1:12:59] okay you
[1:13:01] go when God allows an enemy to come to
[1:13:06] you he has already assessed the
[1:13:11] risk he knows that the enemy is not
[1:13:13] going to overcome
[1:13:16] you so if you are a son or a daughter of
[1:13:20] God there is no
[1:13:22] trial no temptation will come
[1:13:27] unless God knows that you will overcome
[1:13:30] it there is no
[1:13:33] disease that will come to attack
[1:13:37] you if God does not know that you
[1:13:39] overcome
[1:13:41] it so whatever you are going
[1:13:45] through start giving God the
[1:13:48] praise even before you see the signs of
[1:13:51] being
[1:13:52] healed while you were going through that
[1:13:55] pain start praising and say thank you
[1:14:00] Lord once you were going through that
[1:14:03] depression you can start
[1:14:06] rejoicing raise your hands and say thank
[1:14:08] you
[1:14:09] Lord because I already know the
[1:14:13] outcome the outcome is it's not going to
[1:14:15] overcome
[1:14:17] me because God allowed
[1:14:20] it the mere fact that it
[1:14:23] came it means I'm going to overcome
[1:14:26] it if you are not going to overcome
[1:14:30] it God was not even going to allow it to
[1:14:33] come in the first
[1:14:36] place Hallelujah so you can start
[1:14:40] rejoicing and say thank you
[1:14:43] Lord thank you for your
[1:14:46] deliverance thank you for providing for
[1:14:49] me Satan is telling you you are
[1:14:53] lacking you don't have the money that
[1:14:55] you
[1:14:56] need but you can say thank you Lord for
[1:14:58] being
[1:15:00] Jehovah you are feeling
[1:15:03] sick that pain is racking your
[1:15:07] body you can start saying thank you
[1:15:09] Jehovah
[1:15:10] Rafa because I know the
[1:15:14] outcome amen the outcome is that I'm
[1:15:17] Healed the outcome is that I don't
[1:15:20] lack I have everything that I
[1:15:23] need why because I listen to the word of
[1:15:28] God and that word has
[1:15:31] Authority amen amen that's why we're
[1:15:34] supposed to always listen to the
[1:15:37] word the Bible says faith comes by
[1:15:42] hearing by hearing the word of
[1:15:48] God without faith you cannot please
[1:15:53] God that's why Satan throws so many
[1:15:56] distractions to
[1:15:58] you he does not want you to hear the
[1:16:01] word because he knows the moment you
[1:16:03] hear the
[1:16:05] word you're going to have faith and when
[1:16:08] you have faith he cannot stand in Fr
[1:16:11] before
[1:16:12] you and when you have faith you are
[1:16:15] pleasing
[1:16:17] God so he wants you to displease
[1:16:21] God by not having
[1:16:23] faith
[1:16:29] and disbelieving the word of
[1:16:32] God which comes from not hearing the
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:37] word amen amen so it does not matter
[1:16:40] what destruction Satan sends your
[1:16:44] way listen to the word of
[1:16:47] God read your
[1:16:49] Bible pray every
[1:16:51] day that's how we overcome
[1:16:55] the prophet of God preaches and says
[1:16:58] that overcoming
[1:17:00] Satan having
[1:17:02] Victory is recognizing Satan all at all
[1:17:05] of his
[1:17:08] devices so as soon as you realize that
[1:17:11] this distraction is from
[1:17:14] Satan you have already
[1:17:17] overcome amen so go and push press
[1:17:23] play say Lord what do you have for me
[1:17:27] today what do you want me to listen to
[1:17:30] today and when you listen with ears of
[1:17:35] Faith amen you will get to have your
[1:17:38] eyes
[1:17:40] open and know that word has
[1:17:44] Authority and whenever Satan comes for
[1:17:48] you you speak back the
[1:17:52] word Jesus with all the power that he
[1:17:57] had with all the authority he
[1:18:00] had when Satan came to tempt
[1:18:03] him he did not use all uh he did not go
[1:18:07] to his Arsenal to get the strongest
[1:18:13] weapon he just spoke the word because he
[1:18:17] knows that the
[1:18:18] word overcome
[1:18:21] Satan any
[1:18:23] time any
[1:18:25] place
[1:18:27] anywhere so it can work for you whether
[1:18:30] you are at
[1:18:31] home you are
[1:18:33] driving you are in school you in your
[1:18:38] workplace in your business
[1:18:41] dealing know that the word of
[1:18:44] God overcome
[1:18:46] Satan
[1:18:48] anytime in the middle of the
[1:18:51] night in the
[1:18:53] morning in the noon time
[1:18:56] amen that word will overcome
[1:18:59] Satan hallelujah hallelujah so brothers
[1:19:02] and sisters let us use that word because
[1:19:06] that word has
[1:19:09] Authority it has enough
[1:19:11] power to make things happen it has
[1:19:15] enough
[1:19:16] power to make you
[1:19:19] Victorious hallelujah hallelujah sir I
[1:19:22] wanton to read the
[1:19:23] scripture but in the Bible we know when
[1:19:26] Jesus was walking towards the
[1:19:30] disciples they were rowing they were
[1:19:36] fishing Peter and Peter Peter and the
[1:19:39] other
[1:19:40] disciples they were fishing all
[1:19:44] night throwing in their
[1:19:47] Nets nothing comes
[1:19:50] out then they're like
[1:19:52] okay we done all we can
[1:19:56] it's time we
[1:19:59] leave then they see a man walking on the
[1:20:01] shs of G on the shores of the of the
[1:20:07] um of the sea where they were where they
[1:20:10] were
[1:20:12] fishing and this man was none other than
[1:20:16] Jesus and Jesus said launch back those
[1:20:21] Nets and Peter thought
[1:20:25] I've been I've been fish in my whole
[1:20:31] life this is my
[1:20:33] career he knows how the position of the
[1:20:36] Moon affects
[1:20:40] fish and the reason why he was leaving
[1:20:42] because he knew there was
[1:20:46] nothing but he saw Jesus and you heard
[1:20:49] him say put back those
[1:20:53] Nets and Jesus had a
[1:20:56] reputation of not
[1:20:59] failing he had healed every disease that
[1:21:01] came his
[1:21:03] way he Open the Eyes of all the Blind
[1:21:06] Men Who came for
[1:21:09] healing so he know that this man is
[1:21:13] speaking with a certain level of
[1:21:18] authority that is different from every
[1:21:20] other
[1:21:22] man and Jesus said put back your
[1:21:25] nets and Peter says despite all my
[1:21:29] knowledge at Thy word
[1:21:32] Lord I'm throwing in those
[1:21:35] Nets that's the same attitude we got to
[1:21:38] have you say Lord I don't understand
[1:21:40] what you are
[1:21:42] saying but at Thy
[1:21:45] word Let It Be unto me according to your
[1:21:49] word remember we are not called to
[1:21:53] understand
[1:21:55] we are called to
[1:21:57] believe amen so Peter he did not
[1:22:01] understand and he threw in those
[1:22:04] Nets as soon as they threw them
[1:22:07] in Fish fill those
[1:22:10] Nets and when they were trying to get
[1:22:12] them
[1:22:13] out the Nets started
[1:22:18] breaking if the Nets were
[1:22:22] breaking it means that they were
[1:22:23] catching more fish in this net than than
[1:22:26] they had ever caught
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:30] before cuz if they had caught something
[1:22:32] more than that before the net would have
[1:22:34] already been
[1:22:37] broken so the word of God gave him more
[1:22:42] success than he had
[1:22:45] before hallelujah hallelujah and they
[1:22:48] put them in the
[1:22:49] boats and the boats almost
[1:22:53] sank
[1:22:56] that's that's what happens when you take
[1:22:58] God at his
[1:23:00] word you say
[1:23:03] nevertheless I will do it Lord I don't
[1:23:07] understand it but I'm doing exactly what
[1:23:10] you
[1:23:12] say amen amen and when you do
[1:23:15] that get ready for a net breaking
[1:23:22] blessing should get ready for a boat
[1:23:25] sinking
[1:23:29] blessing cuz God's word never fails it
[1:23:34] doesn't matter how many doctors you have
[1:23:37] tried if God says I will heal
[1:23:40] you he's going to heal you it doesn't
[1:23:43] matter how many therapists you have
[1:23:46] seen if God says that depression or
[1:23:49] anxiety is
[1:23:51] leaving I'm just going to go ahead
[1:23:53] anyways cuz I know he's going to
[1:23:56] go why because the master has
[1:24:00] spoken hallelujah hallelujah how many
[1:24:02] are believing this
[1:24:04] evening take God at his
[1:24:07] word get ready for a net breaking
[1:24:12] blessing V sinking blessing amen I'm
[1:24:16] looking forward to
[1:24:19] that uh let us open our Bibles to
[1:24:21] Matthew chapter 88 and verse 5 you can
[1:24:25] project that
[1:24:26] please amen this is a story that we all
[1:24:30] know Jesus was walking and then this
[1:24:34] Roman Centurion came to
[1:24:38] him and when Jesus was entered into cap
[1:24:41] they came unto him a
[1:24:46] centurion beseeching
[1:24:48] him and saying Lord my servant Li at
[1:24:51] home seek of the paly grievously
[1:25:00] tormented and Jesus said unto him I will
[1:25:03] come and heal
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:06] him and the Centurion
[1:25:09] answered and said Lord I am not worthy
[1:25:12] that thou should us come under my
[1:25:16] roof but speak the word
[1:25:20] only and my servant shall be
[1:25:23] healed he realized he was speaking to a
[1:25:26] man of
[1:25:29] authority amen amen he saw Jesus heal
[1:25:32] the
[1:25:33] sick and he went to Jesus and he says if
[1:25:36] he healed
[1:25:38] them he can heal my servant too so
[1:25:41] whatever Jesus is doing for your
[1:25:44] neighbor don't get
[1:25:47] jealousy say just thank you Lord for
[1:25:51] doing it for
[1:25:52] them but now it's my
[1:25:54] turn Hallelujah I need my healing
[1:25:59] also I like this part verse
[1:26:02] n remember Jesus said after he talked to
[1:26:06] this man he said I have never seen such
[1:26:08] faith in
[1:26:13] Israel because this man had a special
[1:26:19] Revelation that did not require laying
[1:26:22] on of
[1:26:23] hands
[1:26:25] amen his
[1:26:27] Revelation was that the word of
[1:26:30] God has
[1:26:32] Authority so speak it I don't care how
[1:26:36] far you
[1:26:37] are I know the moment you will
[1:26:41] speak reach to my
[1:26:44] servant hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:26:46] called Gentile
[1:26:48] faith I'm I'm gentle fi this
[1:26:53] even there's nothing wrong with the
[1:26:55] laying on of
[1:26:59] hands but just speak the
[1:27:02] word just read the
[1:27:05] word speak it to my
[1:27:08] life and I know that suffices
[1:27:11] me verse n it says for I am a man under
[1:27:17] Authority having soldiers under
[1:27:20] me and I say to this man go and he go
[1:27:25] and to another come and he come and to
[1:27:29] my servant do
[1:27:31] this and he do with it let's stay on
[1:27:34] verse
[1:27:36] N I used to read it
[1:27:41] as for I am a man of
[1:27:47] authority so when I tell these men go
[1:27:50] and do this they do
[1:27:53] it
[1:27:55] but then I looked
[1:27:56] again it says for I am a man under
[1:28:01] Authority so when I tell them do this
[1:28:04] and do
[1:28:06] that they will do it kind of doesn't
[1:28:10] make sense right you expect it to be for
[1:28:13] I'm a man who has
[1:28:18] Authority if I tell them to do this they
[1:28:20] do it but he says I'm a man under auth
[1:28:26] Authority he is a so he's saying the
[1:28:29] authority that I
[1:28:33] have is not
[1:28:35] mine it's under the authority that I
[1:28:39] am he is a Roman
[1:28:43] Centurion under the Roman
[1:28:47] government I believe it was Julius
[1:28:50] Caesar that he was
[1:28:53] under because he was under the authority
[1:28:56] of Julius
[1:29:00] Caesar that gave him
[1:29:04] Authority cuz he was representing
[1:29:08] them so when he tells the
[1:29:11] soldiers do this and do
[1:29:14] that he's getting his authority from
[1:29:17] juliia
[1:29:19] [Music]
[1:29:20] Caesar that's the authority that he is
[1:29:23] under
[1:29:25] so he says because I'm a man under
[1:29:29] authority of the Roman
[1:29:32] government when I speak they
[1:29:36] listen amen amen so when because you and
[1:29:41] me we are under
[1:29:44] Authority because we are under the
[1:29:46] authority of the almighty
[1:29:49] God that gives us
[1:29:52] Authority Hallelujah
[1:29:54] because you remember all that was in
[1:29:56] God was poured into
[1:29:59] Christ and everything that was in
[1:30:02] Christ was poured into the church and
[1:30:05] the church is not a
[1:30:07] building the church is you and
[1:30:09] me so we have
[1:30:12] authority remember on the day of
[1:30:15] Pentecost it says you shall receive
[1:30:19] power the original Greek translation
[1:30:21] says you shall receive Authority
[1:30:27] after you receive the Holy
[1:30:29] Ghost where do you get that Authority
[1:30:33] from from God because that's the
[1:30:36] authority you are
[1:30:39] under so he the Roman Centurion CAU this
[1:30:44] Revelation because
[1:30:46] I'm because I'm under the Roman
[1:30:50] government I have the authority over
[1:30:52] these 100 soldiers
[1:30:55] and he say so you just speak the
[1:30:57] word because I know what my word does to
[1:31:00] 100
[1:31:02] soldiers what about you the almighty
[1:31:06] God when you speak all demons have to
[1:31:10] tremble when you speak all the demons
[1:31:13] have to
[1:31:14] leave hallelujah hallelujah he spoke and
[1:31:17] the all the demons that were in Legion
[1:31:22] left but because he was a man of
[1:31:26] authority he was the
[1:31:28] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:31:33] God Amen am and Jesus was the
[1:31:37] word amen amen so the moment you
[1:31:41] realize you are under the authority of
[1:31:43] the
[1:31:45] word you are under the authority of
[1:31:47] Jesus
[1:31:48] Christ that in
[1:31:51] turn it gives you Authority
[1:31:55] amen amen to speak and things will
[1:31:59] happen Hallelujah it will give you
[1:32:01] authority to speak and chase away
[1:32:05] demons because they know who you are and
[1:32:09] they recognize that
[1:32:11] Authority you remember the son of the
[1:32:14] sons
[1:32:16] OFA sons of
[1:32:20] ska Fe the they saw Paul praying for
[1:32:24] uh they saw Paul uh praying for sick
[1:32:27] people and demons
[1:32:31] fleeing and they're like oh that should
[1:32:33] be
[1:32:35] easy they wanted to go try it
[1:32:37] too they ran and they laid their hands
[1:32:40] over
[1:32:41] someone they prayed and the demons asked
[1:32:46] them Paul we
[1:32:48] know Jesus we know but who are
[1:32:52] you
[1:32:54] they didn't have the authority they were
[1:32:56] not under the authority of the Holy
[1:32:59] Ghost so if you don't have
[1:33:02] authority demons will
[1:33:05] know if you have
[1:33:07] authority they will know too amen that's
[1:33:11] why it is
[1:33:14] mandated the prophet of God says it is
[1:33:17] absolutely
[1:33:18] necessary and we are
[1:33:22] compelled that we receive the Holy
[1:33:25] Ghost each and every Christian has to
[1:33:28] receive the Holy
[1:33:31] Ghost Christ Living in
[1:33:33] you so whatever you
[1:33:36] do don't stop until you get that Holy
[1:33:40] Ghost because when you get that Holy
[1:33:43] Ghost you are
[1:33:47] tabernacling the logos
[1:33:49] itself you are tabernacling Jesus
[1:33:52] himself
[1:33:54] you have the word inside of
[1:33:57] you and when you have the word inside of
[1:34:01] you that gives you the authority so you
[1:34:05] and me we have the
[1:34:08] authority that the word
[1:34:11] has amen amen so each and every word
[1:34:14] that's
[1:34:15] spoken has to come to
[1:34:17] pass you and me we are a manifested
[1:34:22] word hallelujah
[1:34:24] when Jesus was walking in in
[1:34:27] Israel he was the word made
[1:34:30] flesh the word that says a virgin shall
[1:34:34] conceive he was that
[1:34:36] word amen the word of Isaiah that says
[1:34:39] his name shall be
[1:34:43] Emmanuel he was that word walking on two
[1:34:47] feet you and me
[1:34:49] also we are the
[1:34:51] word hallelujah hallelujah because the
[1:34:54] word does not
[1:34:55] fail the word has
[1:34:58] Authority David said he shall not suffer
[1:35:00] his only one to see
[1:35:08] corruption that was talking about
[1:35:10] Jesus when he was going to get in the
[1:35:13] grave that word that was spoken was
[1:35:16] responsible for his
[1:35:18] resurrection amen and the word also says
[1:35:22] if that spirit
[1:35:24] if the same spirit that lived in Jesus
[1:35:29] Christ if it dwells in you and
[1:35:31] me we shall be quickened
[1:35:34] too we shall be
[1:35:37] resurrected it doesn't matter way or how
[1:35:39] you
[1:35:40] die God's word has enough power to bring
[1:35:46] you
[1:35:46] up put you into the
[1:35:49] Rapture amenu so that's why you need
[1:35:52] that Holy Ghost
[1:35:55] you need it in your
[1:35:59] life because it gives you
[1:36:01] Authority we all know this sarapan
[1:36:05] woman she knew Jesus had
[1:36:09] Authority she says Lord my daughter is
[1:36:13] sick and Jesus
[1:36:15] said the according to the
[1:36:18] word he had each and every
[1:36:22] right to not heal her
[1:36:26] daughter because this was a
[1:36:30] dispensation of the
[1:36:31] Jews it was not yet time for God to deal
[1:36:34] with the
[1:36:37] Gentiles then she saw
[1:36:40] Jesus and Jesus said it's not me to to
[1:36:44] give uh children's bread to the
[1:36:51] dogs he essentially just called a
[1:36:55] dog if it was today he was going to go
[1:36:58] viral on Tik
[1:37:01] Tok lady went to church and went and was
[1:37:04] called a
[1:37:07] dog but she had
[1:37:09] Faith she knew she was talking to the
[1:37:12] word and she says even those
[1:37:16] dogs they eat
[1:37:18] crumbs that fall from the
[1:37:21] table cuz you know when kids
[1:37:24] they're eating
[1:37:25] bread they throw away more than what
[1:37:28] they
[1:37:29] eat they don't eat the outside they just
[1:37:31] nible in the
[1:37:35] middle and they throw everything away
[1:37:39] and she says that that's what I'm
[1:37:42] eating and have
[1:37:44] faith made a step out of the
[1:37:46] dispensation of the
[1:37:49] Gentiles go get her
[1:37:52] blessings in the dispensation of the
[1:37:56] Jews and God healed her
[1:37:59] daughter why because she
[1:38:01] knew the authority that the word
[1:38:04] had Hallelujah huj in
[1:38:11] expectations the message
[1:38:13] expectations amen it says and I'll say
[1:38:17] this that God keeps every word that he
[1:38:21] said and every promise that he
[1:38:26] said and if you take the right mental
[1:38:32] attitude towards any Divine
[1:38:36] promise that God ever
[1:38:38] made he will bring it to
[1:38:41] pass if you can just take the right
[1:38:45] attitude and you believe it with all
[1:38:48] your
[1:38:49] heart amen amen that world be made man
[1:38:52] that word will be made manifest your
[1:38:55] life if the sarapan woman if she had
[1:38:58] gotten mad and turned her back and
[1:39:02] left her daughter was going to die but
[1:39:05] she had the right mental
[1:39:07] attitude towards God's
[1:39:10] word and God turned around her
[1:39:14] situation and her daughter was
[1:39:16] healed hallelujah hallelujah in my
[1:39:19] Ministry
[1:39:22] explained it says the word of God will
[1:39:27] defeat the
[1:39:28] enemy any place
[1:39:32] anywhere anytime it is written if it is
[1:39:36] written it is the word of God if it is
[1:39:39] the word of God it has the authority the
[1:39:43] same Authority that God has so when you
[1:39:46] believe
[1:39:47] it doesn't matter what whichever place
[1:39:49] you
[1:39:51] are anytime it is
[1:39:54] it has to work it has no expiry
[1:39:58] date even if you have spoken 2,000 years
[1:40:01] ago it does not
[1:40:04] expire it works each and every
[1:40:07] day because God is the same
[1:40:10] yesterday today and
[1:40:14] forever we don't serve a historical
[1:40:17] God a historical God does not do me any
[1:40:21] good amen amen I love to know what God
[1:40:24] did for
[1:40:26] me I say thank you Lord for what you did
[1:40:28] for me two years
[1:40:31] ago amen but I'm not going to stay two
[1:40:34] years
[1:40:34] ago I needed God off
[1:40:38] today I need of God off
[1:40:42] today I need a God off
[1:40:45] tomorrow Hallelujah so you tell them
[1:40:48] Lord thank you for what you
[1:40:50] did but I need you right now
[1:40:53] am mean if he did it before he can do it
[1:40:57] today cuz he never fails the word never
[1:41:02] expires amen he is more than
[1:41:05] able to do what he said he will
[1:41:09] do if God says
[1:41:11] it that says settles
[1:41:14] it all you have to do is rest upon his
[1:41:19] word there's this testimony I heard one
[1:41:22] of the brothers was out hunting with
[1:41:24] brother
[1:41:25] Brandon and they were hunting for
[1:41:31] deer and brother Bram told his brother
[1:41:33] you're going to you're going to get
[1:41:34] you're going to get your own
[1:41:38] deer so you know when people are hunting
[1:41:40] they're going out you know
[1:41:43] looking tracking those foodprints
[1:41:45] looking
[1:41:47] for and when brother Bram told him
[1:41:49] you're going to get your
[1:41:51] deer he got excited he say they say
[1:41:54] what I'm going to get a
[1:41:57] deer this brother stopped
[1:42:01] hunting and went to sleep under a
[1:42:05] tree because he believed that word he
[1:42:08] says if I'm going to shoot a deer why
[1:42:10] should I go out there looking for
[1:42:15] it because I'm going to get it
[1:42:18] anyway he went he went and slept under
[1:42:22] the tree
[1:42:25] he had faith in that
[1:42:27] word he believed that word and remember
[1:42:31] any word has enough Authority just as
[1:42:33] much as you believe in
[1:42:39] it if you don't believe in it it's not
[1:42:41] going to
[1:42:42] work so he believed it and he went he
[1:42:46] slept in the
[1:42:48] shade then he woke up something cool at
[1:42:50] his
[1:42:52] feet
[1:42:54] that was a de sniffing his
[1:43:00] feet then he woke up and said he say
[1:43:02] that's my
[1:43:04] deer then he shot it that was that was
[1:43:08] his
[1:43:09] deer you might start arguing about his
[1:43:15] sportsmanship but that does not matter
[1:43:17] to him the man got his
[1:43:21] deer so when the word word of God Is
[1:43:25] Spoken just go
[1:43:28] rest go sleep under a
[1:43:31] tree your dear is coming right to
[1:43:34] you amen if you just believe in that
[1:43:38] word amen amen so
[1:43:41] remember being under the authority of
[1:43:45] God gives you
[1:43:47] Authority hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:43:50] bride is supposed to have the same
[1:43:52] Authority of the
[1:43:55] groom i' like to uh as I'm wrapping up
[1:43:58] reading perfect
[1:44:01] Faith paragraph
[1:44:03] 93
[1:44:07] 30825 the prophet of God says Jesus had
[1:44:10] perfect
[1:44:12] Faith he had it and it came because he
[1:44:16] was the
[1:44:19] word and you become the word
[1:44:24] you become the
[1:44:25] word as you receive the
[1:44:29] word let's read it
[1:44:32] again Jesus had perfect
[1:44:35] Faith he had it and it came because he
[1:44:39] was the
[1:44:41] word so he had perfect
[1:44:44] Faith cuz remember in the beginning was
[1:44:46] the word the word was with God and the
[1:44:50] Word was God and the Word was the logos
[1:44:54] so Jesus had perfect Faith because he
[1:44:56] was the word and he was there in the
[1:45:00] beginning he had it and uh it come
[1:45:03] because he was the
[1:45:05] word and you become the
[1:45:08] word as you receive the
[1:45:11] word if you abide in me and my words in
[1:45:16] you abide in
[1:45:19] you then ask what you
[1:45:21] will
[1:45:26] ask what you will and it will be done
[1:45:27] for
[1:45:29] you you say to this
[1:45:32] mountain be
[1:45:35] moved and don't
[1:45:38] doubt believe in what you have
[1:45:41] said then you shall have what you
[1:45:45] said amen amen so you become the
[1:45:49] word as you receive the word amen and
[1:45:52] you
[1:45:53] believe what the word says and now when
[1:45:57] you pray believe that you have received
[1:46:00] what you asked
[1:46:03] for and you shall have it it will be
[1:46:07] given to
[1:46:08] you why because you have received the
[1:46:11] word you have become the
[1:46:14] word and now you have the same Authority
[1:46:17] that the word
[1:46:19] has so when you are
[1:46:21] praying you are praying with
[1:46:24] authority when you are speaking you are
[1:46:28] speaking with
[1:46:29] authority time
[1:46:33] space nothing else will ever change
[1:46:36] it you know it's already
[1:46:40] done it's already over
[1:46:43] with it does not matter what it
[1:46:46] is because I have
[1:46:48] prayed because I've received the
[1:46:50] word I am the word
[1:46:53] so when I
[1:46:54] pray it got to happen perfect faith is
[1:46:58] not just regular
[1:47:02] faith it unlocks a different
[1:47:07] realm where impossibilities are changed
[1:47:10] to
[1:47:14] possible amen amen amen brothers and
[1:47:18] sisters the word has
[1:47:20] Authority and you and me we are the
[1:47:24] word so we have
[1:47:26] authority to speak that
[1:47:29] word to take it into
[1:47:32] us remember the quote that
[1:47:35] says if a spirit
[1:47:38] born Spirit-filled
[1:47:42] man takes the
[1:47:44] word and places it upon his
[1:47:48] heart it's the same as deity
