[1:01:50] yeah don't do school
[1:02:03] amen all's well
[1:02:06] now if we need divine love that perfect
[1:02:08] love you know what's happening
[1:02:10] do you sit down move is that that more
[1:02:12] back that
[1:02:13] what does it take to get there
[1:02:18] we're almost
[1:02:29] but before you can have divine faith you
[1:02:32] must have
[1:02:43] amen so let me let me work a little bit
[1:02:45] here by god's great fear
[1:03:00] he brought it down and he took some clay
[1:03:03] and some potassium
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:09] from the ground he blew on it and crazy
[1:03:13] and he created a body for adam
[1:03:17] and that was a man's body it's a then
[1:03:19] called
[1:03:20] he was a direct son of god
[1:03:24] but remember if he was god's direct son
[1:03:27] mr
[1:03:40] so adam found himself living in
[1:03:42] perfection
[1:03:47] and day by day he would go about keeping
[1:03:50] the garden
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:53] working this and working
[1:03:57] and one every night the god would come
[1:04:00] down in the cool the evening
[1:04:04] and he'd say adam how was your day today
[1:04:10] and adam said lord it was perfect
[1:04:15] the weather was just right
[1:04:18] he said i got to pet this animal
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:37] he felt something and he didn't know
[1:04:39] what it was
[1:04:40] something
[1:04:43] and the bible says that
[1:04:45] god said it's not good for man to dwell
[1:04:47] alone amen
[1:04:52] so an even in all this perfection it
[1:04:55] don't do such perfection
[1:04:56] the prophet of god said adam got lonely
[1:05:02] even in the perfect body he still felt
[1:05:05] alone man those are called
[1:05:14] and god feels the same way many times
[1:05:17] amen

[1:05:22] prayer alive

[1:09:28] amen amen
[1:09:31] he had god's
[1:09:32] nature
[1:09:35] amen amen
[1:09:37] now
[1:09:38] you know
[1:09:40] you know in
[1:09:43] 1957 the prophet of god was speaking
[1:09:49] and he's preached this
[1:09:51] he's dealing with uh stand still and see
[1:09:53] the salvation lord 57.
[1:10:18] he says and the waves are about to tear
[1:10:19] a little ship to pieces
[1:10:27] he says there was a lonely galilean
[1:10:29] laying in the boat asleep
[1:10:36] and i thought why the prophet called
[1:10:38] jesus lonely hey
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:52] then the second adam must experience
[1:10:54] loneliness as well i don't reduce him i
[1:10:56] don't
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:51] they would prophesy to them
[1:11:55] he said this body will raise in three
[1:11:57] days
[1:12:00] and even simon peter says it shall not
[1:12:03] come unto thee
[1:12:31] he could send a revelation to i keep
[1:12:34] moving on bryce
[1:13:00] and now christ our god almighty
[1:13:14] because when god speaks he speaks
[1:13:16] spiritual
[1:13:18] spiritual experience so he would need
[1:13:20] someone spiritual hello
[1:13:23] to be able to pick up what he's talking
[1:13:25] about
[1:13:26] hey man praise god
[1:13:30] but we're dealing now we dealt with what
[1:13:32] the character of adam you know
[1:13:36] there was nothing evil in adam yeah
[1:13:40] oh
[1:13:41] i don't and the bible says in genesis
[1:13:43] three he don't
[1:13:57] we know this is
[1:13:58] review we know this is review
[1:14:03] but that word subtopic
[1:14:07] means connie
[1:14:08] uh
[1:14:09] um
[1:14:11] crafty
[1:14:12] seven
[1:14:15] has a type of a smoothness about him
[1:14:19] but it's always the as the definition
[1:14:21] says in a bad sense
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:49] now let's take it look back here at cain
[1:14:52] hello look out
[1:14:55] could you tell me where that spirit and
[1:14:58] that meanness come from
[1:15:08] there was
[1:15:23] nature hello physique he like
[1:15:26] you're not true then there's anymore one
[1:15:28] time
[1:15:30] i was at home
[1:15:32] and my dad was watching my dogs
[1:15:49] and he had a bone in his mouth
[1:15:54] and my dad was watching
[1:15:57] and that male dog was just licking and
[1:15:59] chewing that bone
[1:16:05] just pop it in with his teeth
[1:16:08] and he stayed out there for a half an
[1:16:10] hour having a good time just sucking on
[1:16:11] that bone
[1:16:16] so my dad was time to switch dogs going
[1:16:18] out
[1:16:31] and he took that bone
[1:16:35] and he dug a hole
[1:16:38] and he buried that bone in that hole
[1:16:43] and then he scraped the dirt on top of
[1:16:45] it
[1:16:57] but little did little benjamin know
[1:17:00] man
[1:17:13] and my dog come back in and my dad
[1:17:15] switched dogs
[1:17:19] and that female dog went out
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:27] she went out wagging her tail and if you
[1:17:29] don't
[1:17:32] and she went directly to where that bone
[1:17:34] was buried
[1:17:39] and she dug that bone upon
[1:17:53] feeling like he covered his tracks
[1:18:08] and my dad said the dog's eyes went
[1:18:10] hey
[1:18:25] that animal nature see it's natural down
[1:18:27] your mind has no fear to steal
[1:18:32] that animal nature has no fear yeah
[1:18:37] to go behind someone's back
[1:19:04] the greatest proof i can find in genesis
[1:19:10] if you look in in the bible in genesis
[1:19:12] 1.
[1:19:15] on day 5.
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:19] god creates the fish yeah
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:24] and the bible says that god blessed them
[1:19:28] amen
[1:19:31] but moving into the sixth day
[1:19:34] god
[1:19:45] but at the end of his animal creations
[1:20:01] he never said it was good because it
[1:20:02] would have to remain good
[1:20:06] but the bible said he saw that it was
[1:20:08] good
[1:20:10] he left no blessing
[1:20:14] but notice on the second half of the
[1:20:16] sixth day
[1:20:20] [Applause]
[1:20:30] and we see in that sixth day that god
[1:20:32] blessed
[1:20:34] you
[1:20:36] and when god blesses the bible says he
[1:20:38] cannot lie
[1:20:42] he cannot irrevocable
[1:20:49] so if the god's children are blessed i
[1:20:52] don't see this on for the jews
[1:20:54] they are blessed amen
[1:20:57] even in the old testament covenant with
[1:20:59] abraham
[1:21:02] um
[1:21:05] god bless abraham
[1:21:08] and even in that temporary blessing
[1:21:11] covenant however you want to say it
[1:21:12] don't say
[1:21:20] said i cannot curse what god has been
[1:21:22] blessed amen
[1:21:26] so at the fall of adam and eve
[1:21:29] i don't have
[1:21:30] they are guilty
[1:21:34] and god does not curse adam and eve
[1:21:39] but when he did not bless the end of
[1:21:41] life he left an opening
[1:21:46] and by that offering now he could curse
[1:21:48] the serpents
[1:21:52] but remember whatever is blessed is
[1:22:08] how was god able to curse cain come on
[1:22:13] if he was blessed in genesis
[1:22:17] impossible
[1:22:19] that curse right there came proved who
[1:22:21] was his daddy
[1:22:28] he says now notice what the prophet of
[1:22:29] god says here i don't know look out this
[1:22:31] is going to point back to georgie cain
[1:22:32] he says took the nature of his daddy
[1:22:43] he says now kneeling with cases that
[1:22:45] pure that nature could not come out of a
[1:22:47] pure stream yeah
[1:22:56] compare the two seed lines
[1:22:59] compare the two seedlings
[1:23:03] they do simmers in genesis 4.
[1:23:06] you look at kane and what do you produce
[1:23:09] cayenne circular poetry polygamy
[1:23:11] platform
[1:23:13] metallurgy
[1:23:14] metallurgy just working metal
[1:23:17] let me tell you
[1:23:18] another murderer and the amount i was
[1:23:22] like this a serial killer he killed two
[1:23:24] men
[1:23:26] that was what cain's nature
[1:23:30] but in genesis 5. they don't that sink
[1:23:33] as you run and these are the generations
[1:23:36] of adam yeah
[1:23:40] you don't see any evil nature coming up
[1:23:42] in his genius
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:13] and for the most part
[1:24:28] but where did the sons of god mess up
[1:24:31] his own father
[1:24:34] we know that we're directly after abel
[1:24:39] uh seth came forth
[1:24:56] so directly one after adam they started
[1:24:59] to get in the presence of god again
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:07] but the bible says what the sons of god
[1:25:09] saw the daughters of man
[1:25:15] unfortunately they found his own and
[1:25:17] what took place right there
[1:25:21] it becomes the mixing now
[1:25:33] and now what adam's race is truly
[1:25:37] polluted amen
[1:25:39] adam's race is truly polluted
[1:25:48] as the prophet of god taught
[1:25:50] come to prophet
[1:25:52] how did that seedline get through the
[1:25:55] ark
[1:25:59] you only have one option
[1:26:02] and that noah's sons married serpent
[1:26:04] seed
[1:26:06] that don't i
[1:26:21] displaying itself
[1:26:25] within a few bursts after the flood
[1:26:27] don't don't
[1:26:29] don't don't get caught
[1:26:32] and the bible says in second peter one
[1:26:34] and 4.
[1:26:38] he says whereby are given unto us
[1:26:40] exceedingly great and precious promises
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:49] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:26:52] the divine nature
[1:27:00] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:27:03] the world through love
[1:27:15] praise the lord
[1:27:18] yes
[1:27:20] when
[1:27:22] we

[1:27:37] [Laughter]
[1:27:44] well this sister did this oh
[1:27:47] and this brother did that
[1:27:51] that is not the nature of god
[1:27:57] that is
[1:28:03] adam comes to where abel was killed
[1:28:09] i can't even understand this
[1:28:12] is
[1:28:24] adam knew nothing of that nature i don't
[1:28:28] know
[1:28:31] competition competition
[1:28:35] is not the nature of god
[1:28:39] brother amen

[1:45:11] from what the man anointing soldiers
[1:45:14] wrote
[1:45:29] of which consists in misinterpreting the
[1:45:32] words or actions of others
[1:45:40] the second second there is action result

[1:47:30] by hints or innuendos
[1:47:34] just
[1:47:42] detract from others or incite suspicion
[1:47:45] upon them
[1:48:02] said that these are the most dangerous
[1:48:04] of all the people
[1:48:09] i've been guilty of this many times
[1:48:13] you hear something preached or however
[1:48:30] and
[1:48:37] [Laughter]
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:43] and leaving it right there it deals
[1:48:46] useless it's enough to tell the brother

[1:48:53] other brother
[1:48:56] [Music]

[1:49:02] i didn't have to disclose any other
[1:49:04] information
[1:49:07] but i put a negative twist
[1:49:12] on the
[1:49:25] and even more by your

[1:51:00] amen
[1:51:04] i'm guilty
[1:51:07] but i've repented
[1:51:11] amen now
[1:51:13] let's continue on because i don't
[1:51:14] continue
[1:51:17] even the prophet of god said even those
[1:51:19] that are walking in the spirit
[1:51:23] he says you still have to watch
[1:51:26] us
[1:51:29] because satan can slip in
[1:51:33] things could go going so smooth with the
[1:51:35] holy ghost
[1:51:39] and you watch the devil try and slip it
[1:51:41] and hint or something
[1:51:45] or cause confusion
[1:51:49] amen amen
[1:51:52] in ephesians two and one no
[1:51:55] huh
[1:51:56] let's just jump to three here
[1:52:00] um
[1:52:02] wait for our brother here to get there
[1:52:06] is this plane yeah man let's go see is
[1:52:08] this clear
[1:52:10] and we're gonna hit a quote and i'm
[1:52:11] gonna we're gonna end on this quote here
[1:52:13] coming up
[1:52:28] do you even display brotherly kindness
[1:52:40] divine patience
[1:52:57] among those also we had our conversation
[1:53:00] in times past
[1:53:05] in the lust of our flesh
[1:53:09] fulfilling the divine the desires
[1:53:24] even as others
[1:53:26] see that nature that that wicked nature
[1:53:28] we display all the time
[1:53:34] that is animal nature
[1:53:38] now
[1:53:39] continue on here because i don't
[1:53:40] continue
[1:53:50] now brother branham he deals you
[1:53:52] remember what he said about
[1:53:55] justification
[1:53:59] he said justification is when what he
[1:54:02] says you've never done it in the first
[1:54:04] place
[1:54:08] when you and god truly justifies you
[1:54:14] let me just read it howie because it's
[1:54:16] beautiful he says it
[1:54:20] is see
[1:54:23] he says for instance he deep example if
[1:54:26] brother green
[1:54:27] see plot green
[1:54:29] he says heard that i've been out
[1:54:30] drinking and doing bad things
[1:54:47] forgive me
[1:55:22] and if god has truly justified you
[1:55:27] and you catch that revelation
[1:55:44] that we are obligated to look at your
[1:55:46] brother and sister the same way
[1:55:51] absolutely the truth
[1:55:53] when you look at your brother and sister
[1:55:57] you better be looking at jesus christ
[1:56:01] you better not speak anything evil of
[1:56:03] them
[1:56:05] because why the same judgment you bring
[1:56:07] to someone else that's going to remind
[1:56:09] you because your man
[1:56:10] will be brought unto you
[1:56:22] [Music]

[1:57:17] that that brother bran was talking about
[1:57:18] in the current of time
[1:57:22] with
[1:57:31] because we should be growing stronger
[1:57:36] wronger
[1:58:05] so how are we going to bypass this
[1:58:07] serpent nature hello come on
[1:58:09] i don't i don't know uh basis it's
[1:58:11] natural to cell phone he says there on
[1:58:13] the inside he only has one gate
[1:58:30] to take over in the control tower
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:46] in other words you have to die out to
[1:58:48] yourself
[1:58:53] every time i get a thought or desire i
[1:58:56] shut in ponce one day or a plan
[1:58:59] i want to do in my life one blonde
[1:59:00] because you've been found on my feet i
[1:59:03] must go back and see if that's what the
[1:59:05] lord wants
[1:59:07] to do
[1:59:10] he says
[1:59:11] whether to you or not that's up to you
[1:59:13] if you yield to self-will
[1:59:20] he said that's the only avenue that's
[1:59:23] open to the man that god can come into
[1:59:26] his heart is by self-will in
[1:59:28] articulation
[1:59:34] [Music]
[1:59:43] the prophet says he says when a man is
[1:59:45] converted the prophetic economy
[1:59:48] true
[1:59:49] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:59:52] is free he said the holy ghost comes
[1:59:54] down like a little white button is
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:08] the bible says you are sealed until the
[2:00:10] day of your redemption
[2:00:23] but that still doesn't kill this nature
[2:00:31] he says now
[2:00:33] he can let that spirit grow hello
[2:00:38] you
[2:00:47] your temple is the temple of the holy
[2:00:49] ghost
[2:00:51] he paid the price for you
[2:00:54] he purchased you on
[2:00:56] calvary because i i i i i still can't
[2:00:58] that blood was shed for you society
[2:01:02] so what you could receive then that life
[2:01:04] of jesus christ
[2:01:08] and you have to yield even to receive
[2:01:10] the holy ghost stay back praise be to
[2:01:12] god
[2:01:13] yes
[2:01:14] don't miss this once we receive this you
[2:01:17] then have to start yielding
[2:01:26] he says he can let that spirit grow and
[2:01:28] take all the roots of bitterness
[2:01:32] it is
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:46] and he recites word for word
[2:01:57] [Music]
[2:02:06] until he conquers that just
[2:02:10] he can't go any further
[2:02:14] you can receive the baptism of the holy
[2:02:16] ghost
[2:02:21] [Music]
[2:02:27] you can have you could that first time
[2:02:29] you received the holy ghost now put me
[2:02:30] on
[2:02:44] big you're still bride because that's it
[2:02:48] but there's been no growth
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:53] i've repented
[2:02:56] he says and when he presses he says he
[2:02:58] says when he gets all these things out
[2:03:00] of the way i don't think
[2:03:02] i'll have two shows audrey
[2:03:04] that man that gets all this out of the
[2:03:06] way all this sit down
[2:03:09] even the spirit realm memories
[2:03:24] he could come back to the same condition
[2:03:27] that adam was in the garden
[2:03:29] [Music]
[2:03:33] it's literally that simple
[2:03:37] amen
[2:03:38] repent
[2:03:40] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[2:03:44] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:03:46] holy ghost
[2:03:50] but that is the beginning of the war
[2:03:55] how many soldiers are here come here
[2:03:58] saints of god we have been fighting and
[2:04:00] fighting and fighting amen
[2:04:05] you better get your sword sharpened
[2:04:14] prepare for scriptural war for no reason
[2:04:17] the prophet didn't say prepare for
[2:04:19] scripture war for no reason
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:31] he says
[2:04:33] as he says he can come back into the
[2:04:34] garden of eden condition
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:45] [Music]
