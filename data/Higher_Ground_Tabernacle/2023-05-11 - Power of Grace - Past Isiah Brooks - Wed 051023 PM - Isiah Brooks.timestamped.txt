[42:08] glad to everybody happy everybody here
[42:10] tonight
[42:12] amen I made up my mind to go that way
[42:14] the rest of my life
[42:16] Hallelujah
[42:18] we'll try not to be long tonight
[42:21] uh
[42:23] we kind of started a little message
[42:25] there in Iowa City and just a little
[42:27] interval something to kind of stick in
[42:30] between what I've been preaching early
[42:32] about the the Order of Things
[42:36] because I really believe that when
[42:39] um
[42:40] the seals were open
[42:42] uh things changed
[42:45] in such a mighty way that I believe that
[42:47] a lot of people have not as of yet
[42:51] understood uh what What's really
[42:54] happening not that I'm some brilliant
[42:56] person
[42:57] but uh I I really see that we're now
[43:02] living in the time of translation and
[43:05] and I know there are certain things that
[43:07] the bride must do the bride makes
[43:09] herself ready and this is the most
[43:12] serious time ever
[43:14] in the history of what we call the bride
[43:16] age
[43:17] because we realize that man brother
[43:20] Branham tells us he said that the the
[43:23] the the the the wise and the foolish
[43:25] versions were made out of the same
[43:28] material
[43:29] but there was a a a a cutting that God
[43:33] used to bring out the bride so we
[43:38] trusting that all of us are bride
[43:40] tonight
[43:41] and uh I believe that there's something
[43:45] pulling on you something that calls you
[43:47] to come out and uh so we hope that that
[43:50] the service tonight will be a blessing
[43:52] to you we're going to read from
[43:54] Ephesians the third chapter uh beginning
[43:56] at the 14th verse
[43:58] Ephesians 3 14-21
[44:02] and then we'll go to a revelation 1 and
[44:06] 8. uh it's it's a beautiful situation uh
[44:10] what God is doing and uh but at the same
[44:13] time it is a time uh you know if your if
[44:17] your eyes are not set on Jesus it will
[44:19] be a frightening time of time of fear
[44:23] and the word of God said perfect love
[44:25] casts out fear uh in the sense that
[44:28] because we have an assurance
[44:31] and that Assurance is the promises of
[44:33] God and God is never going back on his
[44:36] promises
[44:37] and this is what I love about the word
[44:39] Ephesians 3 we're going to read from the
[44:42] 14th through the 21st verse
[44:45] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[44:48] father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:51] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[44:54] Earth is named
[44:56] that we would Grant you according to the
[44:59] riches of his glory
[45:01] to be strengthened with might by his
[45:05] spirit
[45:06] in the Inner Man now take note to that
[45:09] strengthen
[45:11] with might
[45:13] by his spirit
[45:15] in the inner man that's important
[45:17] because that's the part of you that God
[45:20] is perfecting
[45:22] that Christ May dwell in Your Heart by
[45:25] faith
[45:26] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[45:31] love
[45:33] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[45:37] what faith
[45:39] and faith
[45:41] is a revelation
[45:43] that God gives you
[45:47] because you can't have faith without God
[45:50] giving it to you that ye being rooted
[45:54] and grounded
[45:56] in love
[45:59] faith and twin faith and love is our
[46:01] twins may be able to comprehend
[46:05] with All Saints what is the breath and
[46:09] the length and depth and height now
[46:13] that's amazing and to know the love of
[46:16] Christ which passeth knowledge
[46:19] that you might be filled with all the
[46:23] fullness of God I love that now unto him
[46:28] that is able to do exceedingly
[46:31] abundantly above all that we ask or
[46:34] think according to the power that
[46:38] worketh where in US
[46:40] unto him be glory in the church by
[46:43] Christ Jesus throughout all ages World
[46:47] Without End Amen
[46:51] Revelations 1 and 8.
[46:55] glad to see y'all tonight
[46:59] Revelations 1 8
[47:02] I am Alpha
[47:04] and Omega
[47:06] the beginning and the ending saith the
[47:09] Lord
[47:10] which is and which was
[47:13] and which is to come
[47:16] the almighty here you find Elohim
[47:21] switching and coming into
[47:24] a natural existence which is which was
[47:28] which is to come and you find out in
[47:32] another scripture in the Book of
[47:33] Revelations he said I am the first and I
[47:36] am the last
[47:37] let us pray our heavenly father we come
[47:40] before you Lord Jesus we thank you for
[47:42] your Amazing Grace we thank you for
[47:44] being so good to us you have been better
[47:47] to us than words can express lord it's
[47:50] every day every day I appreciate your
[47:54] blood I appreciate that place where I
[47:57] can go and ask for forgiveness and ask
[48:00] for your grace and ask for your mercy
[48:03] because Lord without that where would we
[48:06] be
[48:06] thank you Lord Jesus for your Amazing
[48:10] Grace father I pray that you would bless
[48:12] Every Soul here tonight in a special way
[48:16] in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[48:19] amen you may be seated
[48:23] that we preached there in Iowa City the
[48:26] power of His grace
[48:28] brings us to our knees
[48:30] and as I said uh this is uh maybe if you
[48:34] want to say a two-part
[48:36] but I I know one thing about uh Grace
[48:41] his grace brings us to
[48:43] uh his presence
[48:46] uh that is to worship Him
[48:49] because remember in the beginning when
[48:52] Adam and Eve fell it broke uh the the
[48:56] fellowship it broke that that place
[48:58] where we could really worship God
[49:00] it brought in a breach
[49:03] and um but Calvary was our Victory it
[49:07] gave us an Open Door uh to his order
[49:10] again
[49:12] uh we of course uh at the end of all
[49:15] times
[49:17] you and I know that the world is falling
[49:19] apart as as the prophet of God preached
[49:21] it but now we see it more so than ever
[49:24] before
[49:26] in every aspect we find that uh the the
[49:30] the everything is falling apart brother
[49:33] mannum tells us how that things have
[49:36] been so hybrid hybrided that uh uh
[49:40] everything is is out of uh it is it's a
[49:43] it's uh original order
[49:45] but he said now the church though she is
[49:49] hybrid she will not completely Fade Out
[49:53] uh when Jesus come because when he comes
[49:57] he finds the church in a lukewarm
[50:00] condition
[50:01] and we know about the grace of God that
[50:03] the church is supposed to be on fire
[50:06] and this fire is something that only God
[50:10] can light he's the only one that can set
[50:13] you on fire
[50:14] amen but and all of that comes to his
[50:17] grace now none of us Grace is as I said
[50:20] the last time is the uh uh unmerited
[50:23] favor of God it is the thing that God
[50:26] gives us and the reason why he gives us
[50:30] this grace is because we are a part of
[50:34] him
[50:36] amen knowing all things uh he in this
[50:40] message said we didn't willfully just
[50:43] fall into this but we were tricked into
[50:46] it and we know by God's grace that we
[50:51] are now
[50:52] um how can I say it you you save your
[50:56] best for last
[50:58] uh it just what we do I used to run
[51:02] track when I was in high school and when
[51:05] you run a relay you put the fastest man
[51:09] uh really at the end you put him put a
[51:13] fast person at the beginning but you
[51:15] also put a faster person at the end just
[51:18] in case amen someone in between slows it
[51:22] down that one guy at the end can pick it
[51:25] up and bring it to a completion or to a
[51:27] complete Victory and what God has done
[51:30] in this last day he chose us we didn't
[51:34] choose him he chose us but I wonder in
[51:38] in the mind of God he's not surprised
[51:41] but I I just wonder how he's looking
[51:45] looking at us
[51:47] seeing that he sent us a prophet and
[51:50] when brother Brown was on the scene uh
[51:53] the Bride of Jesus Christ was on fire
[51:56] uh but we see as he moved off the scene
[51:59] things took place within the bride and
[52:03] you know it it happens to every Church
[52:06] age uh you know when the messenger is
[52:09] there everybody is on fire then after
[52:12] the messenger leaves we have these
[52:14] Renegade preachers we have people coming
[52:17] in with their own ideas we have people
[52:19] coming amen and miskers growing what
[52:22] what what was previously taught by doing
[52:25] this it literally hybrids the word it
[52:29] brings us down you say well brother
[52:31] Brooks it's not intentional but what we
[52:35] must realize Paul said it like this
[52:38] I must die
[52:42] to everything
[52:44] I thought I knew
[52:48] all of his teachings all of the things
[52:51] that Paul was taught he had to die to it
[52:55] all can you imagine
[52:57] I was telling this to somebody the other
[52:59] day I said here was Paul
[53:03] coming out of a Jewish
[53:05] uh uh tradition
[53:08] uh we want to save Faith but it was
[53:10] their own faith it wasn't the original
[53:12] Faith because had it been the original
[53:15] Faith they would have identified or knew
[53:18] who Jesus Christ was
[53:19] but because of their going down into
[53:23] Babylon
[53:24] when Jesus came
[53:27] they brought some of the Traditions back
[53:29] with them
[53:30] and when Jesus came to Jerusalem he
[53:34] found
[53:35] his own church
[53:37] standing in a place of hierarchy
[53:40] you had the Bishops and
[53:43] you had the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[53:46] and you you you had a church that were
[53:50] ruled by men and not by God
[53:53] and so much so Jesus called them blind
[53:56] lead us
[53:58] and he said if the blind leader leads
[54:00] the blind their boats shall fall in the
[54:02] ditch
[54:03] Hallelujah you and I must understand
[54:06] that the word of God is the word of God
[54:09] it cannot change it will always produce
[54:14] what he said he will produce
[54:17] and if there isn't some if something is
[54:20] hindering the producing of the word it
[54:24] is not God
[54:26] it is our revelation of it or maybe it
[54:30] is something we have added to it because
[54:33] remember amen God says every word is a
[54:37] seed and it's a life seed and will
[54:40] always bring forth of his kind
[54:43] Hallelujah is that right brother random
[54:46] even said he said education is the
[54:48] greatest enemy of the cross
[54:52] of Christianity amen because what we do
[54:56] Amen in our education we try to educate
[55:00] the people into the Holy Ghost that's
[55:03] exactly what the Pentecostals did that's
[55:05] what all the other ages did instead of
[55:08] staying with the blueprint
[55:11] we tried to educate them into the Holy
[55:15] Ghost
[55:16] okay you say well what do you mean they
[55:18] educated them say by saying if you speak
[55:21] in tongues you have the Holy Ghost and
[55:25] nowhere in the word says that
[55:28] you see they added that little thing and
[55:31] that very thing has brought death
[55:34] to the Pentecostal world
[55:37] Hallelujah and whenever we bring our
[55:40] Creeds our darkness and and anything
[55:43] like that into the message it literally
[55:46] brings us back to a place of death
[55:50] now you say well why are you saying it
[55:51] like this
[55:53] because look at the Pentecostals
[55:55] they used to have tongues interpretation
[55:59] of tongues prophecies they had healings
[56:02] they had people that was on fire they
[56:05] had all prayer all night they were they
[56:08] were called crazy because of their love
[56:10] for God y'all hear what I'm saying they
[56:13] were truly on fire but when they began
[56:17] to organize and separate when they began
[56:21] to divide who's right and who's wrong
[56:24] here was a trinitarian he was in Jesus
[56:27] name and God gave them both the Holy
[56:30] Ghost but how do you know that because
[56:32] brother Bradham said so
[56:34] right but they made a difference and
[56:38] when when they divided like that it it
[56:40] it it it it it hybrided the word
[56:44] because God did not call us to be
[56:47] divided
[56:48] matter of fact he taught brother vanon
[56:50] preached a message that the invisible
[56:52] Union of the bride and he talks about
[56:55] how we are to be connected with him not
[56:58] with a society not with the church not
[57:01] with anything that that appears to to
[57:04] look holy right because nothing could
[57:07] look more holy than the Pharisees and
[57:10] the Sadducees Hallelujah but when John
[57:13] saw them he said you are dead men bones
[57:16] he said how would you appear to be white
[57:18] and septica but inwardly your dead men
[57:21] bones Hallelujah and and brother Branham
[57:25] comes along and he tells the
[57:27] Pentecostals you're dead
[57:29] they didn't like the idea of him telling
[57:31] them that because according to their
[57:34] teachings they could shout they could
[57:36] dance they could speak in tongues they
[57:39] could run up and down the aisle
[57:41] but that was not
[57:44] what declared unto them that they had
[57:47] life
[57:48] only the word can give life
[57:53] and they had it for a season
[57:56] but when the light of the word came when
[58:00] God sent Malachi 4. amen and when they
[58:04] refused that word
[58:07] immediately they died
[58:09] and you know I know what I'm talking
[58:11] about now what we fail to see is this is
[58:16] the hour if ever we should stay on the
[58:20] word look into the word read the word
[58:23] meditate on the word and I'm talking
[58:26] about myself this is the hour because
[58:30] the attack is on the word
[58:33] nothing but the word
[58:36] right nothing but the word
[58:41] Paul said I don't have nothing left the
[58:44] only thing I desire
[58:46] is to know him in his suffering and in
[58:49] the power of his resurrection
[58:51] Hallelujah and that's what that's where
[58:54] you and I supposed to be that's where
[58:57] William Branham was that's why nobody
[59:00] could stop him he didn't care about
[59:03] popularity he didn't care whether his
[59:06] teachings were different from someone
[59:07] else why he knew he had truth
[59:11] Hallelujah and he challenged the people
[59:14] if you don't think I'm right show me
[59:17] something different
[59:18] Hallelujah but they knew he was right
[59:22] just like they knew Jesus was right
[59:25] and they did not want
[59:28] to follow him
[59:30] let me let me let me go head on with
[59:32] this see what we don't realize is Satan
[59:36] has raised a war against the bride
[59:43] but his tactic has never changed
[59:47] and his tactic is to hybrid
[59:52] that's all he has to do
[59:54] mix something up with it
[59:56] and make the people declare it is the
[59:59] word when it's not the word
[1:00:01] Hallelujah now president if you don't
[1:00:04] hear what I'm saying go listen to
[1:00:07] condemnation by representation 1960 1123
[1:00:13] go listen to what he's saying because
[1:00:16] you'll realize that this devil is
[1:00:18] smarter than what you think
[1:00:21] how do you know you're saying it right
[1:00:24] brother Brooks
[1:00:25] because even in this message we have so
[1:00:29] many
[1:00:30] fractions
[1:00:33] of faith
[1:00:35] of what we believe
[1:00:37] and my question is which one is right
[1:00:41] the truth of the matter is they're all
[1:00:44] wrong the word is right
[1:00:47] this is why it's so important people you
[1:00:50] better hear what I'm saying see because
[1:00:52] that's what it was with the prophet of
[1:00:54] God and you know people just get so
[1:00:57] indoctrinated
[1:00:59] into their faith to win the truth of
[1:01:02] something comes they can't hear it
[1:01:04] because it's the previous teachings of
[1:01:07] what they've had heard that they they
[1:01:09] just can't separate from it but those
[1:01:12] who are chosen and elected of God will
[1:01:14] know that what I'm preaching is truth
[1:01:16] and I'm not preaching my own thoughts
[1:01:19] I'm preaching the word of God that
[1:01:21] William Brandon brought and the truth of
[1:01:23] the matter is he tried to warn us Amen
[1:01:26] to stay with that word right he told us
[1:01:30] that this thing is an individual walk it
[1:01:33] is not a group session Hallelujah it
[1:01:37] ain't your Camp it's not because you go
[1:01:39] to his church or go to that church not
[1:01:42] even if you go to my church or
[1:01:44] disassembly that does not guarantee you
[1:01:47] heaven
[1:01:49] amen hallelujah
[1:01:54] he did it at the beginning Satan did
[1:01:58] what did he do
[1:02:00] and now in this day he's bringing all of
[1:02:03] his demonic forces
[1:02:04] to challenge the bride on the word
[1:02:08] and you know what she will stand
[1:02:12] Hallelujah now why would she stand
[1:02:16] because she realized
[1:02:18] that the ballot is not hers the battle
[1:02:21] is the Lord's and she understands amen
[1:02:26] the grace that has been given to us see
[1:02:28] when we look at the opening of the word
[1:02:31] and and as that brother preached uh
[1:02:33] Revelation 5 when they began to honor
[1:02:36] God and honor and say Thou Art Worthy
[1:02:37] Thou Art Worthy they realize that
[1:02:40] everything that they achieved in this
[1:02:43] life went back to Jesus Christ
[1:02:46] and what wasn't
[1:02:47] it was the grace of God that made them
[1:02:51] bow to their knees when they realized
[1:02:53] that honor was given to the lamb they
[1:02:56] all fell on their faces they threw their
[1:02:58] crowns off because they realized I'm in
[1:03:01] heaven but the reason why I'm here is
[1:03:04] because of the Lamb of God
[1:03:06] Hallelujah and so many people they don't
[1:03:10] understand what God is doing when God
[1:03:13] opened the book of of that that the book
[1:03:16] of The Seven Seals that that those seals
[1:03:19] will open that we might come to
[1:03:22] understand who we are where we came from
[1:03:24] if you look you mean after the seals
[1:03:28] were open brother Brandon's message
[1:03:29] changed completely and he began to
[1:03:32] direct everything to his bride
[1:03:35] hallelujah or to the bride of Christ why
[1:03:38] because the churches had already put him
[1:03:40] out
[1:03:41] 1956 he preached a message indictment
[1:03:45] showing that that was the last year that
[1:03:48] that if America would not uh repent they
[1:03:52] would miss their Revival and they they
[1:03:55] wouldn't repent they missed their
[1:03:58] Revival you say well that was America
[1:04:00] but what we didn't see
[1:04:02] is the influence that America would have
[1:04:06] on the entire world from that point on
[1:04:09] why did Brother Branham say that those
[1:04:12] demons out of the Euphrates went down
[1:04:14] amen into Hollywood
[1:04:17] because he understood what if they were
[1:04:20] going to do and they're still doing it
[1:04:22] but we're so
[1:04:24] unconnected to God and and I'm preaching
[1:04:28] on me because we're we're tuned
[1:04:30] ourselves into all of this technology
[1:04:34] I don't know how many hours of the day
[1:04:36] and we fail to read our Bible
[1:04:40] we fail to listen to a message
[1:04:43] y'all better hear what I'm saying what
[1:04:45] is he doing he's hybriding you he's
[1:04:48] literally changing your mind amen from
[1:04:51] the word unto science
[1:04:54] and we fail to see that these things are
[1:04:57] good and evil yes there's some good
[1:04:59] about it but there's some evil to it and
[1:05:01] that evil is to distract you
[1:05:04] from the coming of the Lord
[1:05:06] why because in this hour the bride is to
[1:05:10] make herself ready
[1:05:12] how do you make yourself ready
[1:05:14] not by fear
[1:05:17] you make yourself by works
[1:05:20] what do you mean by works
[1:05:22] working in the word
[1:05:25] right study prayer fasting whatever it
[1:05:30] takes you see what brother means I don't
[1:05:32] have to do all of that because I'm
[1:05:33] elected that's what the electorate
[1:05:36] elected elected will do
[1:05:38] Hallelujah you should have prove that
[1:05:40] brother Adam talk about it amen choose a
[1:05:43] govern bride he said that young lady
[1:05:44] that was in the backyard what's that
[1:05:47] once that ranch's son said that he would
[1:05:50] marry her what did she do from that
[1:05:52] point on she worked
[1:05:55] she made herself ready
[1:05:58] she saved her nickels
[1:06:00] Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm
[1:06:02] saying why because we we failed to see
[1:06:05] it
[1:06:06] listen to the message brother Benham
[1:06:08] said it like this and I'm just
[1:06:10] paraphrasing it but he said what
[1:06:12] happened to the church they brought in
[1:06:14] basketball they brought in sports they
[1:06:17] brought all kinds of activities in and
[1:06:19] Incorporated it into the church
[1:06:22] he said they hybrid it
[1:06:27] and what happened he said it became a
[1:06:30] mule
[1:06:31] and a Mew cannot reproduce
[1:06:34] hello somebody do you understand me
[1:06:37] every seed must bring forth of his kind
[1:06:41] and he tells us amen that he preached
[1:06:43] the message conference
[1:06:45] a conference with God and that
[1:06:48] conference is that you get to business
[1:06:50] with God you get down on your knees
[1:06:53] until you know that you know that you
[1:06:55] know that you know
[1:06:56] Hallelujah you talking it over with him
[1:06:59] you're telling him all of your evils and
[1:07:02] all of your troubles and everything that
[1:07:04] you know to tell him Hallelujah
[1:07:07] you have a conference with him but how
[1:07:09] many of you have ever had a conference
[1:07:11] with God
[1:07:12] about your soul
[1:07:15] huh
[1:07:17] because you were born in the message
[1:07:19] because you came up in the message don't
[1:07:22] mean you're in the message
[1:07:23] the only way you can get in the message
[1:07:25] is that you're born again
[1:07:27] you got to have the Holy Ghost on the
[1:07:29] inside now let me tell you something
[1:07:31] brother Randall said this is the most
[1:07:33] evil age ever
[1:07:35] ever
[1:07:37] right that means Satan can personate
[1:07:41] almost everything
[1:07:44] he just can't live the word
[1:07:46] he can impersonates your your Holy Ghost
[1:07:50] but see your Holy Ghost will bring forth
[1:07:52] holy
[1:07:54] it's not going to bring forth nothing
[1:07:56] else he can a person impersonate all of
[1:07:59] that but brother Brandon said he just
[1:08:01] can't live the word
[1:08:04] and I I tell you what I just I just
[1:08:07] don't know what else to tell people you
[1:08:10] know the truth of the matter is who you
[1:08:12] know you can't even get people in this
[1:08:13] message to the altar no more because
[1:08:15] they think that they're so
[1:08:17] self-righteous either that or they're
[1:08:19] just prideful you know I don't know
[1:08:21] which it is it might be both but they'll
[1:08:24] know that they'll need they'll know that
[1:08:25] that need and they'll know that God is
[1:08:27] talking to him but instead of responding
[1:08:30] to the word they'll walk out as if they
[1:08:33] got it all together
[1:08:36] But the saddest part of it is when the
[1:08:39] flood comes
[1:08:42] when it began to strike home
[1:08:45] all you're going to remember
[1:08:48] is all of the chances you had to repent
[1:08:51] and make things right and you missed it
[1:08:54] you let it go
[1:08:56] right
[1:08:57] so what
[1:08:59] what happens when brother Branham came
[1:09:02] what was he to do bring back the
[1:09:05] unadulterated word now I I got things in
[1:09:10] my life right now that I've heard him
[1:09:13] say that says oh God it's me help me
[1:09:17] straighten me strengthen me amen that I
[1:09:21] would barking walk circumspectly to the
[1:09:24] word
[1:09:25] why it is the only thing that's going to
[1:09:28] stand
[1:09:29] we must acknowledge our wrong doings we
[1:09:32] got people amen still yet that won't do
[1:09:35] that
[1:09:37] and what do you think they're going with
[1:09:38] it
[1:09:39] every sin will be exposed
[1:09:42] everything done in the dark would
[1:09:44] brought be brought to the light
[1:09:46] but people think God is dead or
[1:09:48] something they think God don't see you
[1:09:50] say why are you saying all of this you
[1:09:52] hear this preaching
[1:09:54] whether you see it or not that's grace
[1:09:56] and grace will give you the power to
[1:09:58] repent
[1:09:59] Grace will give you the power say yes
[1:10:03] Lord It's Me
[1:10:05] standing in the need of prayer now the
[1:10:07] Bible tells us that they were grounded
[1:10:09] right in faith and love and I said to
[1:10:13] myself where is the root where is the
[1:10:15] ground where is the love
[1:10:20] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:10:23] this love is not mushy it tells the
[1:10:25] truth
[1:10:26] and I find out by the grace of God
[1:10:28] people don't like truth and don't don't
[1:10:30] disturb me because I know I got it no no
[1:10:35] no no no that's one thing the word will
[1:10:37] do it is a two-edged sword
[1:10:40] it was come and it will cut you it would
[1:10:43] go into your secret place it will expose
[1:10:46] you it will do and let me say it like
[1:10:48] this that's what I love about the word
[1:10:52] I don't want to think I'm right if I'm
[1:10:54] wrong
[1:11:00] let me read this quote from Brother
[1:11:01] Branham maybe that'll help you out
[1:11:04] so you'll know I'm not giving you my own
[1:11:06] words
[1:11:07] why is so important
[1:11:09] I've seen people
[1:11:12] you know and and I can't say I I've I've
[1:11:15] I've been squeaky clean
[1:11:18] because this flesh is something else to
[1:11:20] deal with
[1:11:21] but I'll tell you at the times that I
[1:11:24] know that I've been wrong I will
[1:11:25] apologize and ask for God God forgive me
[1:11:28] brother Branham says Amen in the message
[1:11:31] condemnation by representation paragraph
[1:11:33] 131 many times I've heard people say
[1:11:38] then brother Branham because Adam and
[1:11:41] Eve did the evil hybrid the word of God
[1:11:44] cause us to get into the con this
[1:11:47] condition God is unjust if he condemns
[1:11:50] me
[1:11:51] I had nothing to do with it I never
[1:11:54] sinned it was Adam that sin the Bible
[1:11:57] said I was born in sin shaped in
[1:12:00] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:12:02] so somebody represented me
[1:12:05] I need you to hear that somebody
[1:12:08] represented me that's right Adam and Eve
[1:12:11] represented us they basically showed us
[1:12:14] what we would have done
[1:12:16] and yes they put us in sin
[1:12:19] absolutely he said boy Here's a thought
[1:12:23] it might choke you somebody represented
[1:12:26] you as a sinner but it was the one that
[1:12:28] hybrid the word and today if you're
[1:12:31] expecting the Pentecostal church or the
[1:12:34] Methodist the Baptist to represent you
[1:12:36] it's a hybrid word and condemned you're
[1:12:40] condemned because that Adam condemned
[1:12:43] you Adam and Eve being one
[1:12:46] accepted the hybrid form and condemned
[1:12:49] the world so brother Brandon says like
[1:12:51] if there is a church and the church is a
[1:12:55] hybrid Church you're condemned
[1:12:59] see that's why the Bible said there were
[1:13:01] seven women and none of them were found
[1:13:03] faithful which was typing out the church
[1:13:06] but people we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:13:08] Christ we are individuals we're supposed
[1:13:10] to watch everything
[1:13:13] to make sure things go according to the
[1:13:15] word
[1:13:17] when you do that you're bound to get in
[1:13:19] a lot of trouble
[1:13:21] then you say brother Brandon why should
[1:13:23] I where why should God hold me
[1:13:25] responsible because one man represented
[1:13:28] me and then I die because that man is
[1:13:31] sin then I'm a sinner by representation
[1:13:34] that's right you're a sinner by
[1:13:37] representation you never he said God
[1:13:39] don't hold you responsible for being a
[1:13:43] sinner he don't hold you responsible
[1:13:45] because you lie and steal anything you
[1:13:49] do he doesn't hold you responsible for
[1:13:51] being a sinner he holds you responsible
[1:13:55] because you don't help yourself
[1:13:57] there's a wave made for you you reject
[1:14:01] the way that God laid down that's what
[1:14:03] God that's what God condemns you for
[1:14:07] there is a way of Escape
[1:14:10] Hallelujah he says listen High breeding
[1:14:13] High breeding he said oh how terrible
[1:14:15] her breathing here it goes High breeding
[1:14:18] the people New York the Big molting pot
[1:14:21] I got hundreds of precious colored
[1:14:24] friends that born again Christian but on
[1:14:27] this line of segregation and things that
[1:14:30] they're talking about high-breeding the
[1:14:33] people what tell me what's fine culture
[1:14:35] find Christian colored woman would want
[1:14:38] her baby to be a mulatto by a white man
[1:14:41] no sir is not right what white men would
[1:14:46] want her uh baby to be a mulatto by a
[1:14:50] colored man God made us what we are
[1:14:53] let's stay what what God made us I
[1:14:56] believe it's right
[1:14:58] now
[1:15:00] take it or leave it
[1:15:02] and listen people
[1:15:04] there were people in in in in Branham
[1:15:06] tabernacle's family were doing the same
[1:15:08] thing
[1:15:09] mixing it
[1:15:11] but you you see until you understand the
[1:15:13] depth of that you'll never understand
[1:15:15] what he's telling us see right now we we
[1:15:18] know but brother random is talking about
[1:15:21] is right because they hybrid the corn
[1:15:23] the hybrid the cow the hybrid the
[1:15:26] chicken they hybrid everything this is
[1:15:28] the age of high breeding and everything
[1:15:31] that Harvard is dead
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:40] I'm just saying it takes a revelation
[1:15:43] and understanding what he's saying
[1:15:46] I've had people say well you know I
[1:15:48] think he was Prejudiced and I think
[1:15:49] doing because of his time oh man is that
[1:15:52] not the devil
[1:15:53] he always give us a reason to reason
[1:15:57] and when we reason we allow ourselves to
[1:15:59] hybrid and in doing so we bring death to
[1:16:02] family it's out of order
[1:16:09] but in this day that
[1:16:11] come a Spa Royal seed
[1:16:15] of Abraham
[1:16:16] that's exactly what it'll be would be a
[1:16:20] royal bride to the Royal promised son
[1:16:24] as I spoke last night now he talks about
[1:16:27] a raw you'll see but let it he's going
[1:16:29] to Define he's going to bring some
[1:16:31] things out that will Define what this
[1:16:33] Royal seed is
[1:16:35] as I spoke last night it won't be a
[1:16:37] natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed a
[1:16:41] church
[1:16:42] full of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:45] that's what it is it is not because a
[1:16:48] group listen it if this church would
[1:16:52] fill up with with with people it doesn't
[1:16:56] make it a church
[1:16:58] until the Holy Ghost comes in
[1:17:03] that's what it is when the Holy Ghost
[1:17:05] comes in and you know what people say oh
[1:17:07] brother books reading the Unholy almost
[1:17:09] like his old-fashioned the preach on the
[1:17:11] Holy Ghost no sir brother Benham called
[1:17:14] this message his holy ghost message
[1:17:17] it won't change
[1:17:19] it has to be that way it started out
[1:17:22] this way it has to end this way and what
[1:17:26] do we have an intellectual conception of
[1:17:29] the message and nobody's living
[1:17:32] everybody's working with works and law
[1:17:36] how do you know because they can't love
[1:17:39] each other
[1:17:42] the Holy Ghost
[1:17:44] makes you love one another
[1:17:49] that's exactly what it'd be would be a
[1:17:52] royal bride to the Royal promised son as
[1:17:54] I spoke last night it won't be a natural
[1:17:57] seed it'll be a spiritual seed there is
[1:18:00] to be a spiritual bride raised up which
[1:18:04] will be the Royal seed of the royal
[1:18:06] faith of Abraham royal son she is to
[1:18:09] come on the seed in the scene in the
[1:18:12] last day and that time and place is a
[1:18:16] promise that's given to her
[1:18:18] Hallelujah
[1:18:22] oh we should have taken a Rapture by now
[1:18:26] Hallelujah is that right I mean there's
[1:18:28] a quote brother Brown said if God can
[1:18:30] get 10 people on One Accord the Rapture
[1:18:34] would take place
[1:18:35] look it up and if that be true what's
[1:18:38] the problem
[1:18:45] one thing they're better than the other
[1:18:47] that's nonsense by one blood
[1:18:52] are you saved and that's the blood of
[1:18:55] Jesus Christ
[1:18:56] Hallelujah is the truth
[1:19:00] it's the truth we got racism among
[1:19:02] ourselves what kind of stuff is that and
[1:19:05] claim to have the Holy Ghost
[1:19:07] God be merciful to us
[1:19:15] [Applause]
[1:19:19] brother but you shouldn't say that well
[1:19:21] let me say it like this
[1:19:22] when Peter was caught
[1:19:25] with the spirit of racism on him and
[1:19:28] Paul saw him separate himself
[1:19:31] from the Gentiles Paul rebuked him and
[1:19:35] said you make the grace of God of none
[1:19:37] effects
[1:19:41] it's a lie you've been told and it's a
[1:19:43] lie that people believe
[1:19:45] and that's why folks are dead and don't
[1:19:48] know it
[1:19:56] in the place is a promise that's given
[1:19:59] to her according to Malachi 4 scripture
[1:20:02] there is to rise a message that will
[1:20:04] shake the hearts of the people right
[1:20:06] back to the apostolic fathers again wait
[1:20:09] a minute
[1:20:10] and we hear that Apostolic fathers again
[1:20:13] what were they teaching you must be
[1:20:16] saved you must be baptized in the name
[1:20:19] of Jesus Christ you must be filled with
[1:20:22] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the apostolic
[1:20:24] fathers preached amen that you've got to
[1:20:27] have a statue of a perfect man you got
[1:20:29] to grow up into Christ right they teach
[1:20:32] taught all of those things and what are
[1:20:35] we doing with that
[1:20:37] it's become
[1:20:39] head knowledge
[1:20:41] and nobody's just seeking after it I
[1:20:43] won't say nobody only a few people are
[1:20:46] looking toward God to bring them into a
[1:20:48] perfection
[1:20:50] but in the meantime they're just going
[1:20:52] to let their flesh rule them
[1:20:55] right
[1:20:57] rule them with their temper ruling with
[1:20:59] their attitudes rule them when they
[1:21:02] don't come to church what kind of
[1:21:03] Christian that is
[1:21:05] huh no church service is there and
[1:21:08] brother Branham said A True Believer
[1:21:09] when when the can't hardly wait till the
[1:21:11] doors open what about that quote
[1:21:14] True Believer so what makes these other
[1:21:16] people that's not coming what does it
[1:21:18] make them
[1:21:20] I'm just saying that's the message
[1:21:22] what is it because people have allowed
[1:21:25] Satan to hybrid them
[1:21:30] and brother bear said the only way that
[1:21:33] that could ever change is that you gotta
[1:21:35] go back
[1:21:37] to the word where you left it
[1:21:39] destroyed
[1:21:40] according to Malachi 4 a scripture right
[1:21:43] there's a rise a message that would
[1:21:45] shake the hearts of the people right
[1:21:47] back to the apostolic fathers again
[1:21:49] there's a rise one on the scene in the
[1:21:52] power of Elijah that's right that'll
[1:21:54] rise on the scene uh a Wilderness man
[1:21:58] that that'll come out and we'll have a
[1:22:00] message that'll run right straight back
[1:22:03] to the word again that's the hour we're
[1:22:06] living in and he said a spiritual bride
[1:22:10] yeah
[1:22:12] so that means they got to be a corner
[1:22:14] one here somewhere now the power of His
[1:22:17] grace
[1:22:18] is that we would not have known this
[1:22:22] message
[1:22:23] had it not been for the power of His
[1:22:25] grace
[1:22:27] we were all living the way we were
[1:22:29] living
[1:22:31] it was God who came to us
[1:22:34] and it's God who's constantly unfolding
[1:22:37] the word of God
[1:22:39] but if we wait and this is what it is
[1:22:42] see Eagles Eagles feed themselves they
[1:22:46] know how to feed themselves but we'll
[1:22:48] wait listen I know people this message
[1:22:50] don't know nothing about this message
[1:22:53] they don't I mean they you could ask
[1:22:56] them a question and they have no idea
[1:22:58] what you're talking about and here we
[1:23:00] are about to embrace a rapture
[1:23:05] huh Embrace The Rapture and how you're
[1:23:09] going to defeat let me ask you a
[1:23:10] question when the squeeze come on how
[1:23:13] are you going to defeat the enemy what
[1:23:15] are you going to do do you really know
[1:23:17] what the mark of the beast is because
[1:23:19] they've disguised this thing so well if
[1:23:22] you're not careful you'll take it not
[1:23:24] knowing it
[1:23:26] and it's almost on us right now it's
[1:23:29] moving fast
[1:23:32] I know I'm gonna be finished in just a
[1:23:35] minute
[1:23:36] Daniel think about it the pressure he
[1:23:39] had
[1:23:39] but he knew he knew who God was
[1:23:42] right he was all by himself listen he
[1:23:46] prayed three times a day all by himself
[1:23:49] it never said the Shadrach Meshach and
[1:23:51] Abednego was there
[1:23:53] but he stood there he had his Integrity
[1:23:56] he knew God and let me tell you
[1:23:58] something when the pressure comes on if
[1:24:00] you don't know God you're gonna deny him
[1:24:03] just like Peter
[1:24:06] Peter had an intellectual understanding
[1:24:08] of him but when he got the holy ghost
[1:24:10] that coward became a brave Soldier
[1:24:15] Hallelujah that's the only way and what
[1:24:18] people don't understand is that listen
[1:24:20] even the devil when it came to job
[1:24:22] God said you can do anything to job but
[1:24:25] just don't touch his flesh
[1:24:26] right don't take his soul
[1:24:28] excuse me and and and and and and so
[1:24:31] what did the devil say well skin for
[1:24:33] skin
[1:24:34] let me touch him I'll make I'll let him
[1:24:37] curse you right and the devil let me
[1:24:39] tell you something I don't care what
[1:24:42] Affliction you you have God is still God
[1:24:47] and every
[1:24:54] every deal worthy of the glory of the
[1:24:58] honor right of the wisdom everything
[1:25:01] he's listen why because you'll never
[1:25:04] understand what he did for you till you
[1:25:06] get over there
[1:25:10] Hallelujah when you get over there these
[1:25:13] little things that we've gone through
[1:25:14] will become small and you'll understand
[1:25:17] he was working on your behalf even when
[1:25:20] you didn't understand it
[1:25:24] Hallelujah
[1:25:27] yes
[1:25:30] let me tell you
[1:25:33] I look at I look at I look at my
[1:25:36] children and and all that we raise them
[1:25:38] up
[1:25:40] but I'm gonna tell you something they're
[1:25:41] out there where they are because they've
[1:25:43] never got the Holy Ghost
[1:25:45] hello
[1:25:47] and I find out that these parents in
[1:25:50] this message are not teaching their
[1:25:52] children and not trying to get them to
[1:25:54] the Holy Ghost and guess what the world
[1:25:56] has a power
[1:25:58] is going to pull them right on out
[1:26:02] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:26:05] they could be in the church baptized and
[1:26:08] everything look all Sanctified but if
[1:26:11] they don't get the Holy Ghost
[1:26:13] this age is going to pull you right on
[1:26:16] out
[1:26:18] and you know this is a perverted age
[1:26:21] Hallelujah it'll mix your boys Minds up
[1:26:24] it'll mix your girls Minds up because
[1:26:27] that's exactly what they're trying to do
[1:26:30] it must be like Sodom and Gomorrah it
[1:26:34] has to be
[1:26:35] you say well what do you mean what what
[1:26:37] do you think they're doing

[1:26:41] on the political door of lot

[1:26:47] they're doing they're knocking on the
[1:26:48] door of the political realm oh people

[1:26:54] living in it's the grace of God to give
[1:26:57] us eyes to see and are hard to
[1:26:59] understand
[1:27:00] Hallelujah that's what the program said
[1:27:02] flee Brothers fleek
[1:27:06] Hallelujah
[1:27:09] look what happened to Israel when she
[1:27:11] didn't obey the word of God she became
[1:27:14] the Bible said as Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:27:17] you say oh brother boots I don't know
[1:27:18] about that this message people let me
[1:27:20] tell you something you wake up and smell
[1:27:22] the coffee because we have a lot of
[1:27:24] issues in here too
[1:27:31] Hallelujah
[1:27:35] let me read this quote I ain't gonna be
[1:27:36] too much longer because I know it's it's
[1:27:38] it's mid-service
[1:27:39] but uh what am I trying to get you to um
[1:27:42] God took me in such a different way I
[1:27:43] just got to preach it like you want me
[1:27:45] to preach it every man and woman down
[1:27:47] Through the Ages Every Prophet every
[1:27:50] person has always went upon those
[1:27:53] principles job stood firm on it the only
[1:27:57] meeting place of Israel was under the
[1:27:59] shed blood the only place that Shekinah
[1:28:01] Glory fell was under the shed blood the
[1:28:04] only place in Shekinah Glory will come
[1:28:06] don't let me hurt your feelings Baptist
[1:28:09] Presbyterian but the only place that the
[1:28:12] Shekinah Glory Falls is under the blood
[1:28:14] that's the reason you feel there's a
[1:28:17] kind of Pentecostal glory is because
[1:28:19] it's under the blood of the shed blood
[1:28:22] of the Son of God back into the Shekinah
[1:28:25] Glory when it comes when he took his own
[1:28:28] blood and rent the veil into and we come
[1:28:31] into the presence of God the Shekinah
[1:28:34] Glory where His blessings oh it makes a
[1:28:38] new man out of old did you hear what I'm
[1:28:41] saying so don't tell me you're under the
[1:28:44] blood and you still the same old man no
[1:28:47] you've been deceived
[1:28:49] somewhere you've been hybrid
[1:28:52] Aaron's left his Rod there one year and
[1:28:56] it bloomed out and bloomed while it was
[1:28:58] in the presence of the Shekinah Glory
[1:29:01] Now where's these people
[1:29:06] and then when when they do come
[1:29:09] what do they bring
[1:29:13] where is the Shekinah
[1:29:15] where is the anointing where is the
[1:29:17] power of God
[1:29:19] every one of us supposed to bring our
[1:29:21] own link of Fire
[1:29:24] the house should be burning down when we
[1:29:26] come together
[1:29:28] Hallelujah
[1:29:30] something's wrong
[1:29:35] don't y'all realize if the Holy Ghost
[1:29:37] come to a place that is grieved from
[1:29:40] this place it will not return
[1:29:45] it might return to individuals but it
[1:29:47] won't return to this
[1:29:49] Aaron left his Rod there one year and it
[1:29:52] bloomed and I don't mean you gotta shout
[1:29:54] and dance am I the only one that filled
[1:29:57] this void
[1:30:04] Aaron left his rod and there was one
[1:30:07] year and it bloomed out of the bloom and
[1:30:09] and blue blossomed while it was in the
[1:30:12] presence of the kind of Glory any man
[1:30:14] laying in the presence of God's Shekinah
[1:30:17] Glory would take an old dead sinner dead
[1:30:21] in sin and trespasses and Bloom him out
[1:30:25] to a new creature in Christ what are we
[1:30:29] blooming out to
[1:30:30] Hallelujah tradition oh let me tell you
[1:30:33] what Pentecostal people can outshout us
[1:30:36] they can out dance us oh they can outrun
[1:30:40] us they can now speak in tongues they
[1:30:42] still so-called prophesy all of that is
[1:30:46] still dead
[1:30:48] have a name that they live yet they did
[1:30:53] what is this message bringing us to and
[1:30:55] I don't know maybe I'm losing my mind
[1:30:57] but I keep saying to God every day I'm
[1:31:00] going to make it
[1:31:03] Grace I'm gonna make it
[1:31:04] I don't care what I gotta correct
[1:31:09] and help of God
[1:31:11] but I will not allow this church and
[1:31:13] nobody else's Church
[1:31:15] set me in a place where I miss the
[1:31:17] Rapture you saw what brother was why do
[1:31:19] you say that because Moses let the
[1:31:23] people upset him so much
[1:31:26] to he broke the order of God
[1:31:29] and suffered the consequences
[1:31:33] I refuse to be like that
[1:31:42] for anyone we live and move and have our
[1:31:46] own being
[1:31:47] as a certain
[1:31:49] also of your own prophets have said
[1:31:52] for we are also his offspring now we are
[1:31:56] yes we are
[1:31:59] not trying to de-christianize anybody
[1:32:01] I'm not saying you don't have the the
[1:32:03] deceived Gene of God but one thing until
[1:32:05] the anointing until you get with the man
[1:32:08] until you get with the Holy Spirit until
[1:32:11] you get with Christ that seed is just
[1:32:14] laying there
[1:32:16] you're the woman he's the man we need
[1:32:20] his life to live it
[1:32:22] and that seed has to be quickened for as
[1:32:26] much there as we and listen brother
[1:32:28] random said listen he said this the
[1:32:30] atmosphere has to be a hot one
[1:32:33] it can't be lukewarm it can't be cold it
[1:32:37] will not bring forth amen
[1:32:41] but do you think people think about that
[1:32:43] they come
[1:32:46] they bring their ideas
[1:32:49] they come with their
[1:32:52] what you call those magnifying glass and
[1:32:55] want to see everything every move the
[1:32:58] preacher makes every word he says
[1:33:01] they want to judge everything and
[1:33:03] everybody
[1:33:04] and they don't understand that's not
[1:33:07] their business
[1:33:09] Only God can judge us
[1:33:14] but we'll find that people don't realize
[1:33:16] what they're doing
[1:33:18] I'm almost done this is my last
[1:33:20] scripture acts 17 29 30. for as much
[1:33:24] then as we are all the offspring of God
[1:33:27] we ought not to think that godhead is
[1:33:29] like unto gold or silver or stone or
[1:33:32] Graven by Art of man's devices in other
[1:33:35] words and the time of this ignorance of
[1:33:39] this ignorance God winked at but now
[1:33:41] commanded all men everywhere to repent
[1:33:44] and that's what he's doing
[1:33:47] and you know what those who know how to
[1:33:49] repent those who can say Lord cleanse me
[1:33:52] of everything that's not right
[1:33:56] I want everything cleansed out of me I
[1:33:59] want everything I don't care what I
[1:34:01] thought was right I don't care what I've
[1:34:03] been taught and thought and all that
[1:34:05] only you know what is true
[1:34:07] and let me tell you something if you
[1:34:09] take that kind of approach God would
[1:34:12] take you right to the message
[1:34:14] and show you exactly what needs to be
[1:34:16] set in order
[1:34:18] that's God
[1:34:22] just one more almost one more one more
[1:34:25] scripture and I'm Gonna Let You Go first
[1:34:27] John 4 2-4 he said hereby know we the
[1:34:31] spirit of God every spirit that
[1:34:33] confesses that Jesus Christ has come in
[1:34:36] the flesh is of God and every spirit
[1:34:38] that confesses not that Jesus Christ is
[1:34:41] coming the flesh is not of God and this
[1:34:44] is that Spirit of antichrist wherever we
[1:34:47] have heard that it should come and even
[1:34:50] now already is in is it in the world and
[1:34:55] so I'm gonna close on that so you so
[1:34:58] you'll see where it takes us
[1:35:00] anybody that's under this message
[1:35:03] that will allow Satan to make them
[1:35:06] believe
[1:35:07] that they cannot come to a perfection
[1:35:12] that the virtue and the divine nature
[1:35:14] cannot come to its full purpose a full
[1:35:17] place in your life
[1:35:18] if you believe that what brother Branham
[1:35:21] taught on those things are not correct
[1:35:22] it makes you an antichrist
[1:35:25] and let me tell you this whether it be
[1:35:28] you or whether it be me God's word will
[1:35:30] not come back void he will have a
[1:35:33] perfect bride
[1:35:35] whether it's me or you he's going to
[1:35:37] have a perfect bride is already in in
[1:35:41] Emotion amen there are people that are
[1:35:44] changing from glory to glory their
[1:35:47] attitudes are changing they're loving
[1:35:49] God more they're loving people more it's
[1:35:52] happening whether it be you or not and
[1:35:56] what's happening too is that the devil
[1:35:58] is defeating defeating the People by by
[1:36:01] how can I say it making the word look
[1:36:04] like is of none effect
[1:36:08] God is still a Healer he's a steal a
[1:36:10] deliverer he's still a savior he's still
[1:36:13] what he was yesterday he's the same
[1:36:15] yesterday today and forever he's the
[1:36:18] alpha he's the Omega he's the first he's
[1:36:20] the last God will not change because he
[1:36:24] can't
[1:36:24] amen
[1:36:27] we're blessed
[1:36:30] that God sent us a prophet
[1:36:32] that gave us a word to understand that
[1:36:35] we're supposed to be changing into the
[1:36:37] glory of God
[1:36:39] hello let's stand
[1:36:42] don't you settle for anything don't you
[1:36:44] get so busy to your life becomes chaos
[1:36:48] or chaotic
[1:36:50] that's not of God
[1:36:52] right now your life is supposed to be
[1:36:55] forming and shaping up into the image
[1:36:58] and likeness of Jesus Christ
[1:37:03] that's what it's supposed to be and you
[1:37:06] say well brother you could even get busy
[1:37:08] with religious stuff
[1:37:10] too busy to let God work on you too busy
[1:37:14] to have a fellowship uh and communion
[1:37:17] with him too busy
[1:37:20] we do it and we don't understand what
[1:37:23] the devil is doing
[1:37:25] he's keeping keeping because God can't
[1:37:27] come back until the church get on fire
[1:37:30] to the bride is on fire he said I word
[1:37:33] that you be hot or cold those are
[1:37:34] conditions he gave us
[1:37:36] thank you
[1:37:38] we got to be on fire
[1:37:40] just can't this can't remain just a
[1:37:43] church or some order of a church and and
[1:37:46] you say what do you mean well that's
[1:37:47] what a lot of churches have become just
[1:37:50] to order of it
[1:37:53] but the prophet of God specifically said
[1:37:55] if that if that if that vine put forth
[1:37:59] another Branch an original Branch it
[1:38:01] would bring forth the same as the first
[1:38:04] branch and I will not close my eyes I
[1:38:09] will not close my mind Amen to what I
[1:38:12] but what I can see and what I what I see
[1:38:14] you know because it you know it
[1:38:18] in the early days in the app even in the
[1:38:21] apostolic age amen they didn't have to
[1:38:24] wonder who those people was
[1:38:26] signs and wonders followed them that
[1:38:29] life declared it their love the Bible
[1:38:31] said they loved one another that's how
[1:38:33] they knew
[1:38:34] and that's what prophet God said he said
[1:38:36] out of all the gifts if I could just
[1:38:39] have love I Choose Love over all all the
[1:38:42] gifts because that's the ultimate of it
[1:38:44] all
[1:38:45] and you know it's it's so sad it's so
[1:38:48] sad it's so sad you know that that you
[1:38:52] know people
[1:38:54] Minds have gotten such a place even in
[1:38:58] this message because we like Israel we
[1:39:00] thought we couldn't be touched
[1:39:03] but that same devil
[1:39:05] that put them in bondage in Egypt
[1:39:09] crossed over
[1:39:11] and put them in bondage in the
[1:39:13] wilderness and instead of trusting God
[1:39:15] they trust man
[1:39:18] and those same men amen that Nathan and
[1:39:21] Korah who was interpreting the word to
[1:39:23] them caused them to lose their life
[1:39:27] oh that's what people do
[1:39:31] but we're in an age now that you can
[1:39:33] read and study for yourself with the
[1:39:36] Holy Ghost the holy spirit will show you
[1:39:39] what's truth and what's not
[1:39:41] but I pray
[1:39:42] I'm I'm serious for God things are
[1:39:45] happening in my life
[1:39:47] and I'm happy about it
[1:39:51] do I have failures in my life still yes
[1:39:54] I have to confess every day
[1:39:57] uh and ask for forgiveness every day
[1:40:01] but brother random said Paul had to do
[1:40:04] it he had to do it and you're going to
[1:40:07] have to do it
[1:40:08] but in all of that we know that because
[1:40:12] of his victory in Calvary
[1:40:16] we we we we will be made whole because
[1:40:19] he that begun the good work in US is
[1:40:22] faithful to complete it let's bow in a

[1:40:50] straight course that the word of God
[1:40:53] will become my headship the the crown of
[1:40:56] your glory o my head Lord have mercy

[1:43:03] had to fight through
[1:43:06] Lord they hated him in there
