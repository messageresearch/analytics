[15:51] let's just remember our brother keith
[15:54] the affliction disappeared
[15:56] friction came back
[15:58] he's just been having some
[16:01] testing with
[16:02] [Music]
[16:03] that
[16:04] affliction
[16:06] but one thing we know that god has
[16:07] already given us the victory
[16:10] let's remember uh sister margaret
[16:13] dingleman
[16:15] she came here some years ago
[16:18] god delivered from cancer
[16:20] and
[16:40] so let's remember she is of age
[16:54] we also
[16:55] remember our sister janine who is
[16:58] over in
[17:03] with illinois
[17:05] real
[17:06] wonderful saints of god through some
[17:08] trials
[17:09] let's pray that god will
[17:11] anoint them in such a way
[17:14] to they would feel as if they were in
[17:17] the clefts of the rock
[17:19] while the storm is passing over
[17:22] i just remember my wife remember
[17:25] little uh
[17:26] judah that god will increase his
[17:29] understanding of
[17:31] she's teaching him and we need god to
[17:33] move
[17:34] there in that situation
[17:37] and most of all
[17:39] last but not least if i can say it like
[17:40] that just always continue

[17:54] we always have things to pray for
[17:56] there's no such thing as i don't have
[17:58] nothing to pray for that's quite selfish
[18:01] when i say that i mean because there's
[18:03] so many other things outside of your
[18:04] realm that we need to
[18:06] pray for let us pray

[42:49] word father god in jesus christ and we
[42:51] pray amen
[42:53] amen let's turn our bibles to exodus
[42:56] 25 we read the verse 22.
[43:08] exodus chapter 25 verse 22.
[43:13] amen the bible says
[43:15] and there i will meet with thee
[43:18] and i will commune with you from above
[43:20] the mercy seat
[43:21] from between the two cherubims
[43:24] which are upon the ark of the testimony
[43:28] of all things which i will give the in
[43:30] commandment unto the children of israel
[43:34] let's turn again to hebrews chapter 10
[43:37] verse 9 to 18.
[43:44] hebrews
[43:45] chapter 10
[43:47] verse 9 to verse 18.
[43:55] the bible says then said he
[43:58] lo i come to lord come to do thy will oh
[44:01] god
[44:02] he taketh he taketh away the first
[44:05] and he may establish the second
[44:08] but the witch will wish
[44:11] by which we are sanctified through the
[44:13] offering of the body of jesus christ
[44:15] once and for all
[44:16] and every priest standeth daily
[44:18] ministering and offering oftentimes the
[44:21] same sacrifices
[44:23] which can't never take away sins
[44:26] but this man after he had offered one
[44:30] sacrifice for sins forever
[44:32] set down on the right hand of god
[44:35] from henceforth
[44:36] expecting till his enemies be made his
[44:39] full stool
[44:41] for by one offering he has offered he
[44:44] has perfected forever
[44:46] them that are sanctified
[44:49] wherefore the holy ghost also is a
[44:51] weakness to us
[44:52] for after that he had said before
[44:56] this is the covenant
[44:57] that i will make with them after those
[44:59] days saith the lord i will put my laws
[45:03] into their hearts and in their minds
[45:06] will outright them
[45:07] and
[45:08] their sins and iniquities will not
[45:11] remember no more
[45:13] now where remission of this is there is
[45:16] no more offering for sin
[45:19] amen we may you may be seated
[45:22] but this afternoon i have a i have a
[45:24] little subject that uh entitled the
[45:26] altar and the ark
[45:29] amen the altar and the ark because if we
[45:32] go back to uh exodus when god gave moses
[45:36] uh
[45:37] the plane you know the blueprint of the
[45:39] of the tabernacle the tabernacle had
[45:42] that the entire thing had three
[45:44] different parts there are different
[45:46] chords the first one was the outer chord
[45:49] that represented justification because
[45:52] because that was where the first altar
[45:55] was
[45:56] meaning that people had to come and then
[45:58] offer their sacrifices and you know
[46:00] those lambs were
[46:02] killed and then after that the chief
[46:04] priests will go in into the into inside
[46:06] the tabernacle
[46:08] and then the law because the law
[46:10] required death for for our for the
[46:13] justification because the bible says
[46:15] that
[46:15] the soul that sinneth is the soul the
[46:18] soul will be preparing so the only way
[46:21] to be justified something had to take
[46:23] place something had to take your place
[46:25] it's like the prophet says that the only
[46:27] way for us to leave something else has
[46:29] to die you know we eat
[46:32] in order for us to eat something else to
[46:34] die for so that we can eat in order for
[46:36] us to grow something into that daily so
[46:39] that's that was the same thing with
[46:40] justification we we sinned and something
[46:43] had to die to take our place and make
[46:45] sure that we can be justified and we
[46:47] know as the bible teaches us that jesus
[46:50] christ died for us jesus christ took our
[46:52] places and he died for us so that we can
[46:54] be justified
[46:56] amen and then the second part the second
[46:58] court was the holy place
[47:00] that was when you entered into the
[47:02] temple the first court was the only
[47:04] place
[47:05] that was where the altar of incense was
[47:07] there that the sweet smell because when
[47:10] the chief priest had offered that
[47:11] sacrifice amen that was smelling so bad
[47:14] it was stinky so they had to put some
[47:17] perfume in it you know so that you know
[47:19] that sacrifice will go out we go up with
[47:22] that sweet smell and the prophet comes
[47:25] and teaches us that jesus christ is the
[47:27] rules of the the the rules of sharon
[47:30] amen he's the sweet smell of our
[47:32] sacrifice amen when we're done when we
[47:34] we have done all those bad things we've
[47:36] seen and you know we transgress we
[47:38] commit all those iniquities and stuff
[47:41] amen jesus christ you know our sacrifice
[47:43] becomes smelly because he smells so bad
[47:46] so jesus christ died so that so that
[47:48] that sacrifice become you know so that
[47:51] he died as the rules of sharing so that
[47:54] we can smell so that that sacrifice can
[47:55] smell good so that when we pray and our
[47:58] prayers go up to god and that prayer
[48:00] will have the sweet smell of jesus
[48:02] christ and then the third part
[48:05] was where the ark was that was the
[48:08] holiest of holies
[48:09] that was when the priest was entering
[48:11] there once in a year that was it was
[48:14] entering the the day of the atonement to
[48:17] atone for the sins of himself and then
[48:19] the sins of the people amen that was
[48:21] where the ark was and there the ark that
[48:24] was where the the the tablet of the law
[48:28] was and that was where the mercy seat
[48:30] was that was you know that was the most
[48:32] sacred part of the entire tabernacle
[48:35] amen and the prophet says that now the
[48:37] other courts represented justification
[48:40] which was their water baptist which was
[48:43] there what a baptism the lover set out
[48:47] there
[48:48] that was washed before the before they
[48:51] ministered
[48:52] and the altar represented the sacrifice
[48:54] the sacrifice place
[48:56] where the punishment was put or expelled
[48:59] for the judgment was placed upon this
[49:03] for the judgment was placed upon the
[49:05] brazen altar and the and the brush
[49:07] speaks of divine judgment the brush
[49:10] serpent in the wilderness spoke of
[49:12] divine judgment the serpent being seen
[49:15] already judged in the garden of eden and
[49:18] brass spoke of divine judgment
[49:21] like the praise and altar where the
[49:23] sacrifice was burned
[49:25] amen so that was you know because they
[49:28] had to offer that sacrifice first before
[49:30] going in
[49:31] and then the holiest of holies the
[49:34] holiest of holy represent our hearts
[49:37] amen because the bible says that as we
[49:39] read it in in hebrews 10 that that god
[49:43] will write the law inside of our heart
[49:46] it may like ezekiel said that he will
[49:48] give you the heart of flesh he will take
[49:50] away the stone your heart it will give
[49:51] you the heart of flesh he will rot the
[49:53] law of you know heart that's the bible
[49:55] says that but the bible says in jeremiah
[49:57] chapter 31 33
[49:59] but this shall be the covenant that i
[50:02] will make with the house of israel after
[50:04] those days say of the lord i will put my
[50:07] law in their inward part
[50:10] and write write it in their hearts and
[50:13] will be their god and there shall be my
[50:15] people
[50:16] and there shall teach no more every man
[50:18] his neighbor
[50:20] and every man his brother saying know
[50:22] the lord for they shall all know me from
[50:26] the least of them unto the greatest of
[50:29] them say of the lord for i will forgive
[50:32] their iniquity and i will remember their
[50:34] sins no more
[50:35] amen god had to that was where that's
[50:38] because that our hearts is the sacred
[50:40] part amen our heart is where god dwells
[50:43] in our hearts amen it's word if it's
[50:46] where the god dwells that's where god
[50:48] like likes to be amen it's the same
[50:50] thing like in the temple amen
[50:53] jesus all the glory of god was in the it
[50:55] was in the the holiest of holy amen that
[50:58] was where the cherubims were where they
[51:00] are keeping you know uh uh uh protecting
[51:03] the the ark protecting the ark of the
[51:06] covenant amen god had to put god has to
[51:09] put the lord his law in our hearts and
[51:11] man he has to change it first before he
[51:13] puts the law in our hearts he has to
[51:15] change it first because he has to be
[51:17] something where the law of god remains
[51:19] he meant that place has to be holy that
[51:21] place has to be sacred that place has to
[51:23] be amen without sin that place has to be
[51:26] sanctified so god before he puts his law
[51:29] in our hearts and he has to change it
[51:31] first he has to sanctify it first he has
[51:33] to purify
[51:35] then he has to you know that you have
[51:37] you have to go through a transformation
[51:39] i mean you have to
[51:41] i mean you have to be converted amen
[51:43] before he does so because remember
[51:46] amen when when he was talking to
[51:49] and his
[51:49] he tell peter wait until you are
[51:51] converted then go and then you go
[51:54] strengthen my people even wait until you
[51:56] are converted wait until your heart is
[51:58] being changed then you will go continue
[52:01] the work that i was doing amen you'll
[52:03] see that those disciples even they've
[52:05] been with jesus even those disciples
[52:07] they had the greatest mastery that the
[52:09] world has ever seen even jesus christ
[52:11] himself teaching them the word teaching
[52:13] them about love amen teaching them about
[52:16] you know about living for others
[52:18] teaching them about about all those
[52:20] about all those great teachings that the
[52:22] bible teaches us but after but before he
[52:25] told them that before you go continue
[52:27] this work you have to wait until you are
[52:30] converted amen until you have been
[52:33] changed until your heart amen have been
[52:35] changed until you have received the new
[52:37] spirit the the spirit of god then you
[52:40] can go and and and be my weakness amen
[52:43] in order for us also to be god's
[52:44] weakness amen our heart we have to be
[52:47] converted being converted doesn't mean
[52:49] that you mean you you were uh uh
[52:52] in a catholic church you leave the
[52:54] catholic church you joined the message
[52:55] amen that's not being converted even
[52:58] being converted it's not like you you
[53:00] belong to this church and now you are
[53:02] now going to the other church no that's
[53:04] not being converted being converted is
[53:06] to have to have that transformation from
[53:08] within amen and that transformation from
[53:11] within amen will reflect your life from
[53:14] the outside the prophecy that through
[53:17] the lutheran age came forth the jail
[53:20] shall live by faith
[53:21] the outer court
[53:23] along came along came the the methodist
[53:26] church the sanctification age
[53:29] they call the second definite work of
[53:31] grace
[53:32] which come in that age
[53:35] and there is an outer age
[53:37] and then in the last days is the
[53:39] restoration of the holy spirit the
[53:41] hidden life and i'm sure right here is
[53:45] here is where the trouble lays
[53:48] i want you to see it
[53:50] right here is where the trouble is with
[53:53] the church today
[53:56] they can't deviate between the altar and
[53:59] the holiest of holies
[54:01] in there is where the place
[54:04] where the church ought to be
[54:06] and there is too many of them still on
[54:09] the outside
[54:10] out there instead of being in here
[54:13] that's the reason why that's the reason
[54:15] we have our days that we that we have
[54:18] and the lack of faith that we have when
[54:21] the church should be in the in its last
[54:23] age
[54:24] its last dispensation i believe we're
[54:27] living it at the turn of of time
[54:30] god's god's help tomorrow night i will
[54:32] prove that that i will prove that by the
[54:35] bible but word by word that we're living
[54:38] in the shadows
[54:40] of the coming of the son of god
[54:42] right now right now just watch how the
[54:45] scripture will prove it without the
[54:47] shadow of doubt even the things that's
[54:50] taken place
[54:51] is a scientific proof
[54:54] that we are at the end time might be any
[54:57] time
[54:58] and here the church is still
[55:01] dealing outside here amen here the
[55:04] prophet is explaining that that's where
[55:05] the problem is because the church
[55:07] doesn't want to move emma from the outer
[55:10] courts to the holiest of holies amen
[55:12] they want to stay behind they don't want
[55:14] to go in amen because we know that in
[55:17] the back in the old testament going in
[55:19] amen was only the chief priest who was
[55:21] allowed to go in once a year but after
[55:24] jesus christ died amen he rendered the
[55:26] curtain amen gave giving us the ability
[55:29] to go in now in this time going staying
[55:33] staying outside of that place even its
[55:35] death by going inside is his life but
[55:38] now the church amen they rather stay
[55:40] behind rather stay outside of that
[55:43] holiest of holies amen that's why we
[55:45] have our days that's what we have our
[55:46] ups and downs amen that's why sometimes
[55:49] we have faith sometimes we don't have
[55:50] faith amen that's why sometimes a man we
[55:53] feel it man sometimes sometimes we are
[55:55] driven by by the things of the world
[55:57] amen because we're not going we don't
[55:59] want to go in that's why we don't want
[56:01] to stay in there amen you'll notice that
[56:04] when the man when the man where the
[56:05] manner was come
[56:07] when amanda fell down amen that same man
[56:10] that was the same one had the same
[56:12] nature with the man and that was hidden
[56:14] inside of the holiest of holies but
[56:16] you'll notice that the manna that was
[56:18] eaten outside amen only had a certain
[56:21] period of time amen they couldn't keep
[56:23] it for two days or a day or after but
[56:26] the same manner that was kept inside
[56:28] amen that was to stay eternally amen he
[56:31] didn't have a dead period amen is that
[56:34] that man i represent also the holy
[56:36] spirit amen the holy spirit when he
[56:38] comes down amen everybody can feel it
[56:40] amen everybody can eat of it everybody
[56:43] can experience it everybody can say well
[56:46] i was blessing that service amen god
[56:48] spoke to me and and and i felt the lord
[56:50] and i felt god speaking to me i felt the
[56:52] hand of god touching me but the
[56:54] difference is were you eating of that
[56:56] holy spirit the difference is where are
[56:59] you keeping that holy spirit amen if
[57:00] you're eating it on the outside amen
[57:03] that holy spirit will only have a
[57:04] certain time amen that holy spirit will
[57:07] have a period and after that you know
[57:09] your experience will mean nothing but if
[57:11] you're eating but if you're receiving
[57:13] the holy spirit in the holiest of holies
[57:15] amen the holy spirit will never run dry
[57:17] the holy spirit will stay there forever
[57:20] amen that holy spirit will be there
[57:22] forever and when you say that where
[57:23] brother isaac i've been to a meeting and
[57:26] where we all experienced the holy spirit
[57:28] god really spoke to us and and and the
[57:31] holy spirit was there we saw people
[57:33] healing and people receiving the holy
[57:35] spirit but when we came down but when we
[57:37] came back maybe my place after a week or
[57:39] two amen i don't feel that experience
[57:42] anymore my revival i don't have the same
[57:44] revival amen i don't have the same fire
[57:46] but when i look at my brother here amen
[57:48] he's always on fire amen he always
[57:50] praises god the difference is where
[57:52] you're eating from that holy spirit the
[57:54] difference the difference is where are
[57:56] you keeping that man amen you have to
[57:58] keep it in the holiest of holies amen
[58:00] that's where we have to be and that's
[58:02] where we have we ought to keep it
[58:05] amen because the man that represented
[58:07] the holy spirit god send it
[58:10] amen
[58:11] anybody can eat of it like the prophet
[58:14] said that the bible says that he meant
[58:15] that the right the the rain falls down
[58:18] on you know on the adjusted the unjust
[58:21] of the g and the just but it's the
[58:23] fruits that shows the the first that
[58:25] shows the true nature of the seed that
[58:27] is inside of you amen amen when the word
[58:30] of god is spoken amen it depends on
[58:32] where you're receiving that word amen if
[58:35] it's only intellectual word amen that
[58:37] will that will not do it any good amen
[58:40] but he has to be in your heart amen he
[58:42] has to be in your holiness of holies
[58:44] which is our heart amen which is where
[58:46] god stays amen which is the temple of
[58:49] god which is where god dwells
[58:52] and when you can't experience you can
[58:53] have experience you can experience god
[58:55] and be lost you say well brother i said
[58:57] what do you mean
[58:58] amen the children of israel
[59:01] amen they had more experience than many
[59:03] of us here in this room
[59:05] amen they saw how god amen
[59:08] divided the red sea
[59:10] amen they saw how god amen created
[59:13] immense things and they saw how god even
[59:16] punished pharaoh and his army they saw
[59:19] how how the people of fire amen was
[59:21] living from be before them and going
[59:24] back behind them to to make sure that
[59:26] they were safe and they they had all
[59:28] those great experiences but the
[59:30] difference is that those experienced
[59:32] men didn't influence their inside amen
[59:35] they're inside inside of them it meant
[59:37] they were still the same people who left
[59:39] egypt and they were gonna go in the
[59:40] desert amen because they weren't changed
[59:43] amen but when you change the man when
[59:45] you've been transformed amen and you
[59:47] experience god that experience will stay
[59:50] there forever amen that experience will
[59:52] be there amen to remind you every time
[59:54] that you're going to stray that there is
[59:56] a god who lives that every time that
[59:58] you're going astray amen that there is a
[1:00:00] god who takes care of you that every
[1:00:02] time amen that you feel tired that every
[1:00:04] time that you feel like you don't have
[1:00:06] faith amen that experience will come
[1:00:08] back to you to remind you that hey look
[1:00:10] once you had that same experience and
[1:00:12] look what god has done for you amen it's
[1:00:14] the same thing with david amen all those
[1:00:17] children of israel so and the others
[1:00:19] they had experienced him and they've
[1:00:20] been to many wars and they fought him
[1:00:23] and people were strong and all of them
[1:00:25] but the difference is that david is
[1:00:27] experienced was there a man to remind
[1:00:30] him every time that he serves a god who
[1:00:32] lives that every time that his god is
[1:00:34] able to deliver him even from every
[1:00:37] obstacle that he will have that's when
[1:00:39] you had to face goliath even he had to
[1:00:42] remember about the experience that he
[1:00:43] had
[1:00:45] back there in the desert even he had to
[1:00:47] remind he had to remind himself a man
[1:00:49] about the experience of killing the lion
[1:00:51] and he had to remind himself the
[1:00:53] experience of killing the bear because
[1:00:55] amen that same goliath even god would do
[1:00:58] the exact same thing that he already
[1:00:59] done before amen but that's what our
[1:01:02] experiences are for you may notice the
[1:01:04] same manner that was in out in the outer
[1:01:07] court
[1:01:08] amen also in the holiest of holies but
[1:01:11] these men out here give up quickly
[1:01:14] you've met people like that
[1:01:16] would eat out there and say well brother
[1:01:18] branham i had the same thing i did this
[1:01:22] and i did that just like they did i've
[1:01:24] met that woman but i've met that woman
[1:01:27] she's always on the out she's always on
[1:01:29] the out on the on the house stop
[1:01:31] i mean there's never a worry in her mind
[1:01:35] i've met that man wherever he is he's
[1:01:38] got a big smile on his face and saying
[1:01:40] praise the lord how do you ask him how
[1:01:42] are you feeling he says wonderful and
[1:01:45] every time he gets sick the preacher
[1:01:47] comes prays for him brother he's out and
[1:01:50] gone to the next day he's just wonderful
[1:01:53] i just can't hold my blessings and my
[1:01:55] blessing somehow now the prophet says
[1:01:57] that it's the place you are abiding on
[1:02:00] you're abiding it it's where you went
[1:02:03] amen i want you to get this close
[1:02:05] remember
[1:02:06] that remember many times
[1:02:09] on the campground
[1:02:10] these blessings right now
[1:02:13] you're eating the manna the correct man
[1:02:16] but you haven't consecrated your life
[1:02:18] yet
[1:02:19] and went into a place like aaron behind
[1:02:22] the holiest of holies when he was when
[1:02:25] he was in there
[1:02:27] nothing he didn't hear uh when he was in
[1:02:30] there he didn't hear the world no more
[1:02:34] amen you're eating the correct money
[1:02:36] amen you eating the same exact things
[1:02:39] that everybody else is eating but you
[1:02:41] haven't consecrated your life yet
[1:02:44] that's the big difference
[1:02:46] even you haven't consecrated your life
[1:02:48] yet but once your life has been
[1:02:50] consecrated to christ amen once your
[1:02:52] life has been
[1:02:53] converted and when you receive the same
[1:02:56] word amen you hear the same prophet that
[1:02:58] you've been hearing all the time now you
[1:03:00] have a different impact in you amen now
[1:03:03] it'll have a different that way it will
[1:03:05] have a different influence even in you
[1:03:07] amen it's like it's like it's like uh
[1:03:09] peter
[1:03:10] amen he was received he was hearing the
[1:03:12] same word of jesus amen all the day but
[1:03:15] one time he came he came across a
[1:03:18] different event as someone who was sick
[1:03:20] and he couldn't he could be a man he
[1:03:21] couldn't heal that person couldn't be
[1:03:23] healed amen because
[1:03:26] his heart wasn't converted yet amen
[1:03:28] because a amen he wasn't consecrated him
[1:03:31] and he he didn't have the holy spirit
[1:03:32] but once after that they all been
[1:03:35] through that experience of of of the
[1:03:37] upper room now the same peter amen who
[1:03:39] was afraid now he comes out they saw
[1:03:42] someone asking him for money amen when
[1:03:44] he says that servant god i have not but
[1:03:46] what i have i give to you amen he spoke
[1:03:49] the word and that man was able to walk
[1:03:51] amen they weren't made they were able
[1:03:53] now to do miracles they meant to pray
[1:03:55] for the sick and those people were
[1:03:56] healed amen to do those great things
[1:03:58] that they couldn't do before why because
[1:04:00] at this time it meant it was the same
[1:04:02] word that they were preaching i mean it
[1:04:04] was the same word that they were
[1:04:05] listening to by the differences their
[1:04:08] heart now was changed it meant a change
[1:04:10] has happened inside of them amen that
[1:04:12] was but that was made that was that that
[1:04:15] that that that that changed the reaction
[1:04:17] or or or or that that changed it meant
[1:04:20] the the impact of the world and said of
[1:04:22] the word inside of them
[1:04:24] amen that's why we have our ups and
[1:04:26] downs amen because people don't want to
[1:04:28] go the people don't want to stay in the
[1:04:30] presence of the lord amen
[1:04:33] back in exodus amen i think chapter 20
[1:04:37] amen when god tell moses that the death
[1:04:39] angel will pass him and he tell them to
[1:04:41] apply the sign and then god insisted and
[1:04:44] told moses to stay in there amen to
[1:04:47] remain in the house where the sun was
[1:04:49] applied amen to stay there amen does the
[1:04:52] same thing with us even when the sign of
[1:04:54] christ has been applied amen we have to
[1:04:57] remain in there amen we don't have to go
[1:04:59] out amen we have to remain in there amen
[1:05:02] because that's where the great things
[1:05:03] happen amen that's where amen we become
[1:05:06] one and we'll become one with christ
[1:05:09] i mean that's where that's where amen we
[1:05:11] talk to him personally we have a direct
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:14] we have a direct uh uh
[1:05:17] fellowship with him amen you'll notice
[1:05:19] that in the garden of eden when god
[1:05:22] created uh adam and eve before there
[1:05:25] there were no ark amen there was no ark
[1:05:28] or no no altar in the garden of eden
[1:05:32] amen there were no altar there amen
[1:05:34] there are no they didn't have to go and
[1:05:36] kill the lamb for it for sacrifice or
[1:05:39] anything amen because they were the
[1:05:41] temple of god amen because the altar was
[1:05:44] inside of them amen because the ark was
[1:05:46] inside of them amen that's why they had
[1:05:49] that that direct relationship with god
[1:05:51] that's why they had that direct
[1:05:52] fellowship with god but after the fall
[1:05:55] amen that's when god told them to create
[1:05:58] that arthur that's when god told them
[1:06:00] that that every time that you want to
[1:06:02] meet me or every time that you want to
[1:06:04] pray amen you have to you know he has to
[1:06:07] be on that altar
[1:06:08] amen and then you understand that
[1:06:10] that that that when jesus stepped that
[1:06:13] before that also
[1:06:14] that everybody
[1:06:16] had the ability to go and offer before
[1:06:19] the law everybody had the ability to go
[1:06:22] and offer a sacrifice amen he wasn't
[1:06:24] only the chief priest amen the chief
[1:06:26] priest
[1:06:27] that came after the law that god told
[1:06:29] them that only the chief priests will
[1:06:31] come we will go and be and offer those
[1:06:33] sacrifices but but after jesus christ
[1:06:36] died even the bible says that he made us
[1:06:39] kings and priests amen we became those
[1:06:42] chief priests and men to go and offer
[1:06:43] the sacrifices amen to be able to go in
[1:06:46] the holiest of holies amen to pray for
[1:06:49] our sickness to pray for our healing
[1:06:51] amen to pray for our holy spirit and
[1:06:53] receive it
[1:06:54] amen but you say oh brother branham i
[1:06:57] received the holy ghost yeah i eat the
[1:07:01] good things of god
[1:07:03] but you're in the courts out yonder
[1:07:05] that's the reason
[1:07:07] that's the reason it don't hold on
[1:07:10] that's the reason this year you're doing
[1:07:12] pretty good and next year you back in
[1:07:14] the world
[1:07:16] this revival you're doing fine while the
[1:07:18] revival is on
[1:07:19] but when the revival is gone then you're
[1:07:22] gone somewhere else and now with the
[1:07:24] world
[1:07:25] you say oh i received the holy ghost i
[1:07:27] spoke in tongues i shouted
[1:07:30] that's all right
[1:07:31] i have nothing to say about that
[1:07:33] but why don't you what by white donut
[1:07:36] but white doesn't he
[1:07:37] hold out
[1:07:39] that's it that's what the world look is
[1:07:42] that that's what the world is looking at
[1:07:45] that's what the people are saying
[1:07:47] if you're professing this great high
[1:07:50] calling that then why and she'll what i
[1:07:53] mean why aren't you living it or what
[1:07:56] why aren't you living like that amen if
[1:07:59] you're professing that great calling
[1:08:00] amen if you're professing that god has
[1:08:02] done some great things with me and i've
[1:08:04] been i met christ and amen i had that
[1:08:07] experience with god but why aren't you
[1:08:09] living like
[1:08:10] like christ lived amen because the first
[1:08:13] time that this state that that people
[1:08:15] weren't named christian it meant it was
[1:08:17] because their lives amen reflected the
[1:08:20] life of god amen it was before because
[1:08:22] their lives their men reflected amen the
[1:08:25] lives of jesus christ that's why they
[1:08:26] gave them those that's why they they
[1:08:28] call them christians being the followers
[1:08:30] of christ amen and if you profess
[1:08:33] yourself being a follower of christ even
[1:08:35] your life has to have to reflect the
[1:08:37] same thing
[1:08:38] i mean your real life has to reflect
[1:08:40] amen the life of christ
[1:08:44] and then you see that
[1:08:47] michelangelo
[1:08:49] him and he wanted to create a perfect
[1:08:51] image of moses
[1:08:53] amen he wanted to create a perfect
[1:08:54] statue he created the perfect statue of
[1:08:57] moses but when he saw that perfect
[1:08:59] statue he looked at it and he admired
[1:09:02] his own works amen but he said that it's
[1:09:04] missing one thing because it's not
[1:09:06] talking it's not moving
[1:09:08] and then he went and it
[1:09:10] and he was frustrated because he
[1:09:12] couldn't make that statue talk him and
[1:09:14] then he broke that he broke the leg
[1:09:16] because he was frustrated and you see
[1:09:18] that god amen also had a vision of his
[1:09:21] son amen god also had a vision of a
[1:09:24] perfect son amen god also had a vision a
[1:09:27] man of a masterpiece that he was
[1:09:29] creating but the difference is that god
[1:09:31] couldn't stop with one amen god had to
[1:09:34] continue even until that master peace
[1:09:37] comes it meant until until that person
[1:09:39] comes and becomes like him him and he
[1:09:42] created adam and eve being the first his
[1:09:44] first his first works amen but but you
[1:09:47] see that adam adam chose to invent to
[1:09:50] to to see in him and he disobedies obey
[1:09:52] the word of god amen god didn't stop
[1:09:55] with him and then he had to but then
[1:09:57] then after that noah came and when the
[1:09:59] prophet said that noah died they died
[1:10:01] being drunk amen they met god didn't
[1:10:04] stop and then then after that moses came
[1:10:07] but moses failed to keep his word then
[1:10:09] after moses amen many prophets they came
[1:10:12] amen by the rain when trouble was come
[1:10:15] what trouble came for them and then they
[1:10:16] did they ran away amen but one day
[1:10:20] and when god even one day
[1:10:22] god in that masterpiece came
[1:10:25] it meant that they did to reflect him to
[1:10:27] reflect god himself amen that was the
[1:10:30] masterpiece that he was waiting for amen
[1:10:32] that was a masterpiece that was in his
[1:10:34] mind even when he was creating amen all
[1:10:37] those scents of the old testament amen
[1:10:39] but one day his vision came there amen
[1:10:42] he was seeing himself as jesus christ
[1:10:44] amen the masterpiece someone who
[1:10:47] reflected him even someone who spoke
[1:10:49] exactly what he wanted him to say he
[1:10:51] meant someone who walked exactly how he
[1:10:53] wanted him to walk even someone who went
[1:10:56] exactly when where he wanted him to go
[1:10:58] even even even jesus christ himself said
[1:11:01] i can't do anything unless the father
[1:11:04] tells me what to do amen he was the
[1:11:06] masterpiece that god had in his mind but
[1:11:08] by god amen even though he had that
[1:11:10] masterpiece him and he just couldn't
[1:11:12] step by one masterpiece alone amen
[1:11:15] that's why he had to shrug jesus amen on
[1:11:18] calvary amen that's why he had to strike
[1:11:20] him on calvary amen amen to create many
[1:11:23] masterpieces amen to create many little
[1:11:26] jesus amen so that god will looking at
[1:11:29] us and then he will see himself amen
[1:11:31] sort of god looking and looking at us
[1:11:33] amen he will see himself he'll say that
[1:11:35] well now my work is done amen now the
[1:11:38] picture that i had before the foundation
[1:11:40] of the world amen now here they are amen
[1:11:43] now here they are amen back like you
[1:11:45] know back in the garden of eden amen now
[1:11:47] here they are amen where they have the
[1:11:50] altar and the ark inside of them amen
[1:11:52] because jesus christ himself says that i
[1:11:54] am the temple amen destroyed this temple
[1:11:56] and then i will be rebuilding in three
[1:11:58] in three days amen those people didn't
[1:12:00] understand what jesus was talking about
[1:12:02] amen jesus wasn't talking about the
[1:12:05] amendment building but he was talking
[1:12:06] about himself amen being the temple of
[1:12:09] god amen by now the bible says that
[1:12:11] jesus that that jesus christ is inside
[1:12:13] of us amen making us the temple amen
[1:12:16] because inside of us amen which make us
[1:12:19] that we have the altar and the ark at
[1:12:21] the same place amen that create the
[1:12:23] perfect image the perfect covenant of
[1:12:25] god
[1:12:26] amen that was the common ground where
[1:12:28] god had to meet his people amen he was
[1:12:30] in the tabernacle amen that was a common
[1:12:33] ground where god had to meet his people
[1:12:35] amen and the prophet tells us that god
[1:12:37] meets his people in jesus christ under
[1:12:39] the blood amen and then jesus christ is
[1:12:41] inside of us amen because we are the
[1:12:44] temple amen jesus christ dwells inside
[1:12:46] of us meaning that the common ground
[1:12:48] that god god comes and meets us amen is
[1:12:50] inside of us amen because god is inside
[1:12:53] of what jesus christ is inside of us
[1:12:55] amen the rod of aaron
[1:12:58] amen the same old rod that was that
[1:13:00] aaron was using remember once that rod
[1:13:03] came you know went in the holiest of
[1:13:04] holies amen that rod became something
[1:13:07] new
[1:13:08] amen that rod amen became new amen he
[1:13:11] was refreshed amen that rod amen became
[1:13:14] something new amen at the same moment
[1:13:17] that you go in that place in the holiest
[1:13:19] of holies amen you become something new
[1:13:22] amen your old nature will go away amen
[1:13:25] there is a transformation when you go to
[1:13:27] that place even something new happens
[1:13:30] amen there's a new experience amen you
[1:13:32] are refreshed when you go to that place
[1:13:35] amen you will you will bear fruits now
[1:13:37] people will be able to eat from it amen
[1:13:40] amen that's what the prophet says that
[1:13:42] it meant the pro that's where the
[1:13:43] problem is because the church doesn't
[1:13:45] want to go in there amen the church
[1:13:47] doesn't want to go in the holiest of
[1:13:49] holies amen but we have to go in the
[1:13:51] wholeness of holies amen because being
[1:13:53] outside of that place is death amen but
[1:13:56] we have to go in there
[1:13:58] amen the reason why people are not
[1:14:00] refreshed today
[1:14:02] is because they don't have time amen to
[1:14:04] spend with him
[1:14:05] amen because they can't get quiet
[1:14:08] it may be man because they don't want to
[1:14:10] listen to what god is saying amen they
[1:14:13] can't get quiet before god amen by one
[1:14:16] aaron was going there amen amen he was
[1:14:19] going there and meant to to hear what
[1:14:22] god was saying
[1:14:23] amen that was where god the presence of
[1:14:25] god was amen amen that was where it
[1:14:28] meant the glory of the shekinah was amen
[1:14:31] he was getting there amen admiring him
[1:14:33] at the works of god amen amen amen
[1:14:36] because even the cherubims
[1:14:38] themselves they had to hide their faces
[1:14:40] they meant they had to cover themselves
[1:14:42] amen because the place that that place
[1:14:44] was a holiest place amen so that that's
[1:14:47] why when when the chief priest was going
[1:14:49] there eman had to sanctify himself even
[1:14:52] he had to wash himself even he had to
[1:14:55] even he had to cleanse himself from
[1:14:57] everything that was unworthy even he had
[1:14:59] to go there amen now that place is
[1:15:02] inside of us in a meaning that we have
[1:15:04] no room for for sin amen we have no room
[1:15:08] for error amen we have to be a holy we
[1:15:10] have to be a holy people amen we have to
[1:15:13] to to sanctify ourselves every day amen
[1:15:16] that's why paul says that i killed
[1:15:18] myself amen i killed this body daily
[1:15:21] amen because inside of me dwells the the
[1:15:24] body of jesus amen the side of me amen
[1:15:26] dwells the the altar amen the the ark of
[1:15:30] god amen that's why my body has to be a
[1:15:32] holy that's why my temple this temple
[1:15:34] has to be a holy temple
[1:15:36] amen that's the reason why jesus
[1:15:39] when he went to the temple and saw
[1:15:40] people selling and and and changing
[1:15:43] money and doing all those stuff that
[1:15:45] wasn't only that wasn't holy even he had
[1:15:48] to destroy those tables and then he had
[1:15:50] to to to to kick those people out of
[1:15:52] that place and he says that the house of
[1:15:55] god is called the house of worship amen
[1:15:57] is called the house of prayer amen and
[1:16:00] if you have the house and if you are the
[1:16:02] house of god that means that your body
[1:16:04] is also the body of we pray amen that
[1:16:06] means that your body is also the body of
[1:16:08] worship amen that means that amen is
[1:16:10] where you go when you meet god amen
[1:16:13] because god is inside of you amen that
[1:16:15] means that you have to treat it even
[1:16:17] like the house of prayer amen that means
[1:16:19] that you have to treat it amen let the
[1:16:21] house of worship amen that means that
[1:16:23] you have to get away from everything
[1:16:25] that defiles this body amen you have to
[1:16:27] get away from everything amen that that
[1:16:29] ruins him at the body of god or the
[1:16:31] temple of god amen the the veil had to
[1:16:35] be divided
[1:16:37] because it was separating those two
[1:16:40] those two courts
[1:16:42] it meant because the veil
[1:16:44] before the before the fall that we
[1:16:47] didn't have the veil wasn't there before
[1:16:49] then amen because god was going down
[1:16:52] every night and and fellowshipping with
[1:16:55] with adam and eve but after the fall
[1:16:57] amen he created that veil because seeing
[1:17:01] god was death amen because touching god
[1:17:04] amen was an automatic death amen but now
[1:17:07] after calvary even had to destroy that
[1:17:10] veil amen because god wanted that unity
[1:17:13] with his bride amen god wanted that
[1:17:15] fellowship to be wanted to restore that
[1:17:18] fellowship even so that so that we we
[1:17:20] can become one with him amen so that we
[1:17:22] can see him we can touch him we can hear
[1:17:25] him even we can speak to him amen that's
[1:17:28] why he rendered that veil even so that
[1:17:30] we can go to that place amen now in
[1:17:33] making the altar and the ark in one room
[1:17:35] amen where you can offer your sacrifice
[1:17:38] amen and and then god the presence of
[1:17:41] god will be there
[1:17:42] amen making the ark and the art in one
[1:17:45] room amen making it a complete worship
[1:17:48] amen people are living in the holy place
[1:17:52] instead of living in the holiest of
[1:17:53] holies
[1:17:54] amen in the holy place
[1:17:57] amen it's good living in the holy place
[1:17:59] but there is a difference between the
[1:18:00] holiest of holies in the holy place
[1:18:03] amen the holy place amen they had a
[1:18:05] candlestick i agree amen all of that but
[1:18:08] the difference is in the holy place
[1:18:10] the word depending of the name they were
[1:18:13] depending on nature i mean they were
[1:18:15] depending on the oil that wasn't the
[1:18:16] candlestick and the those candles were
[1:18:19] burning as long as oil was inside of
[1:18:22] that of of those sticks and when the
[1:18:25] holy place amen amen was different
[1:18:27] because there they didn't have the glory
[1:18:29] of shekinah with him but the holiness of
[1:18:32] holies amen they didn't depend on the
[1:18:34] light of the sun or they didn't depend
[1:18:36] on the light of the candlestick but god
[1:18:38] himself was the light amen in the
[1:18:40] holiness of holies amen the dependent of
[1:18:43] god himself amen if the nature if the
[1:18:46] the the climate change the climate
[1:18:48] change wasn't a big woman
[1:18:50] didn't concern them because there they
[1:18:52] didn't care about the climate change
[1:18:54] amen they didn't care about it that now
[1:18:57] it's winter or now it's it's fall summer
[1:19:00] now the the sun is changing now it's
[1:19:02] sunny i can't see or it's dark i can't
[1:19:04] see but there in the holiest of holies
[1:19:07] amen god himself was there
[1:19:09] amen they didn't have ups and downs
[1:19:11] there amen they didn't have good times
[1:19:14] and bad times in there amen every time
[1:19:16] was great amen everything was great amen
[1:19:19] everything was perfect amen because they
[1:19:21] were depending of god himself
[1:19:24] amen and that's where god wants us to be
[1:19:26] amen in the holiness of holies amen
[1:19:28] where we depend on him on him alone amen
[1:19:32] we can see the life of jesus amen he was
[1:19:34] depending on christ and he was depending
[1:19:36] on god himself am i that's why he didn't
[1:19:39] have any ups and downs amen even though
[1:19:41] he was hungry for 40 days after fasting
[1:19:44] amen the devil came to tempt him amen he
[1:19:46] didn't even move a little bit because
[1:19:48] there it wasn't depending on the not on
[1:19:50] the natural food it meant it was
[1:19:52] depending of god himself and he says
[1:19:54] that the men shall not live by but bread
[1:19:57] alone by the by everybody everything
[1:19:59] that every word that comes from the
[1:20:00] mouth of god even because his life his
[1:20:03] entire life was depending of god himself
[1:20:05] amen that's what the nature of the
[1:20:07] things from the outside couldn't
[1:20:09] influence him and his his heart in the
[1:20:11] inside amen because he was a hundred
[1:20:13] percent submitted to god himself
[1:20:17] amen in first kings chapter 18 verse 30
[1:20:20] to 32
[1:20:22] the bible says and elijah said unto the
[1:20:24] people
[1:20:26] come near unto me and all the people
[1:20:28] came near unto him
[1:20:30] and he he repaired the altar
[1:20:33] of the lord that was broken down
[1:20:36] and elijah took 12 stones according to
[1:20:39] the number of the tribes of the son of
[1:20:41] the sons of jacob
[1:20:43] unto whom the word of the lord came
[1:20:45] saying israel shall be thy name
[1:20:49] and with the stones he built an altar
[1:20:52] in the name of the lord
[1:20:54] and he made a trench a trench about
[1:20:57] about about the altar
[1:20:59] as great as will contain two measures of
[1:21:02] seed
[1:21:03] and when you see that
[1:21:05] elijah wanted in mount carmel
[1:21:08] at the showdown
[1:21:10] amen those people those prophets of baal
[1:21:14] about amen
[1:21:15] they they came
[1:21:18] they built their own altar
[1:21:20] and then they made the noises and all of
[1:21:22] that but god didn't appear amen they
[1:21:25] didn't have fire
[1:21:26] but when did the but not when it was
[1:21:29] elijah's turn it meant to offer his
[1:21:31] sacrifice amen the first thing that
[1:21:33] elijah had to do
[1:21:35] even he had to build the altar
[1:21:38] amen because that's the basics amen
[1:21:40] that's the that's the foundation
[1:21:42] amen of everything amen if the altar is
[1:21:44] not built you know
[1:21:46] properly amen there is no i mean god
[1:21:49] will not accept that sacrifice amen
[1:21:52] that's why he came the first thing he
[1:21:53] had to do he had to rebuild the altar
[1:21:56] amen according to what god said amen he
[1:21:59] took 12 stones he meant that represented
[1:22:02] the the the
[1:22:04] the children of
[1:22:05] of jacob
[1:22:06] amen and then he built it according to
[1:22:08] god's plan and he offered the sacrifice
[1:22:11] and the fire came from above and burned
[1:22:13] that sacrifices and then he had to build
[1:22:15] the altar to show them that there is
[1:22:17] only one god
[1:22:18] amen he had to build that altar amen to
[1:22:21] show them that there is only one god
[1:22:22] because the bible says that he built it
[1:22:24] he beat the altar in the name of the
[1:22:26] lord amen to show them that there is
[1:22:28] only one god we don't serve we don't
[1:22:30] worship many gods amen there is only one
[1:22:33] god that we worship
[1:22:34] but after that after amen after after
[1:22:37] that he prayed and
[1:22:38] and the fire came
[1:22:40] but we see that in our age now after
[1:22:43] you know the pentecostal
[1:22:45] amen many things came down many doubt
[1:22:48] many people came with different
[1:22:50] doctrines and and and many things and
[1:22:52] different teachings that was false that
[1:22:54] was against the bible
[1:22:56] amen but now at the last days when god
[1:22:58] sent us the larger of our time amen
[1:23:01] before doing everything and then he had
[1:23:03] first to restore the altar and when he
[1:23:06] head first to restore the altar amen to
[1:23:08] bring us back in the world and to bring
[1:23:10] us back in the word amen to restore that
[1:23:13] altar because that altar was destroyed
[1:23:15] even with those doctrines and and and
[1:23:18] deeds and and all the things that that
[1:23:20] that the people before him even came and
[1:23:22] preached and then he had to do you had
[1:23:24] to restore it first amen he has to
[1:23:26] restore it saying that there is only one
[1:23:28] baptism amen which is in the name of on
[1:23:31] the holy in the name of the lord jesus
[1:23:33] christ amen he has to restore the mean
[1:23:36] amen the mystery of the fatherhood
[1:23:38] sonship and the holy ghost amen saying
[1:23:40] that it's not three different gods but
[1:23:42] there is only one god amen he had to
[1:23:44] restore it saying that amen it's not
[1:23:47] three different bodies or there's that
[1:23:49] or the the the father is different from
[1:23:52] the the son and the son is different it
[1:23:54] meant from the holy ghost but those
[1:23:55] things are the same one amen by god
[1:23:58] reflecting himself in different amen in
[1:24:00] different times and in different bodies
[1:24:03] and when he had to restore that teaching
[1:24:05] amen he had to restore the order of the
[1:24:07] church and when he had to restore the
[1:24:09] saying that there is only what's up
[1:24:11] there is only
[1:24:12] there's only salvation in one name and
[1:24:14] that name is the lord jesus christ amen
[1:24:17] he had to restore him and above marriage
[1:24:19] and divorce even he had to restore about
[1:24:22] the serpent seed amen telling the people
[1:24:24] that it's not the apple or or some kind
[1:24:27] of fruits that people were thinking of
[1:24:29] or if you meant any kind of doctrines it
[1:24:31] means telling them it meant exactly what
[1:24:33] it was and then he had to repair that
[1:24:35] altar
[1:24:36] and then he had to repair it so that the
[1:24:38] blood of jesus christ can be on it amen
[1:24:41] then the fire will come and people will
[1:24:43] be changed and then he had to repair it
[1:24:45] iman so that so that people can be
[1:24:47] changed they made so that people by
[1:24:48] hearing the word of god amen that word
[1:24:51] were having the impact in their lives
[1:24:54] even he had to do that
[1:24:56] amen
[1:24:59] amen ii chronicles chapter 26 verse 16
[1:25:03] to 20.
[1:25:06] amen that shows us it
[1:25:08] but when but when he was strong
[1:25:12] his heart was lifted up to his
[1:25:14] destruction
[1:25:16] for his for he transgressed against the
[1:25:19] lord his god
[1:25:20] and went into the temple of the lord to
[1:25:23] burn incense
[1:25:25] upon the altar of incense
[1:25:28] and azaria
[1:25:29] the priest
[1:25:30] when went in after him
[1:25:32] and with him and with him fourth corps
[1:25:35] priest of the lord
[1:25:36] that were valiant men
[1:25:38] and that we stood uh husiah the king
[1:25:42] and said unto him
[1:25:45] it up
[1:25:46] uh uh
[1:25:48] it belongs not to the
[1:25:50] usayah
[1:25:51] to burn incense unto the lord
[1:25:54] but to the priests of the sons of aaron
[1:25:57] that are consecrated to burn incense go
[1:26:00] out of the saint go out of the sanctuary
[1:26:03] for thou has trans trespassed
[1:26:06] neither shall it be for that honor
[1:26:09] from from the lord god
[1:26:11] then uzziah
[1:26:13] was
[1:26:14] was rough
[1:26:15] and had
[1:26:17] a sensor
[1:26:18] in his hand to burn incense
[1:26:20] and while man while he was worth with
[1:26:23] the priest
[1:26:24] the leprosy
[1:26:26] event rose up in his forehead before
[1:26:29] before the priest in the house of the
[1:26:30] lord from beside the incense altar
[1:26:34] and
[1:26:35] azaria the chief priests and all the
[1:26:37] priests looked upon him and behold he
[1:26:40] was leprous
[1:26:41] in his forehead
[1:26:43] and they thrust him out from dents
[1:26:46] yeah himself hasted also to go out
[1:26:49] because the lord has meeting him
[1:26:51] even here the bible is only teaching us
[1:26:54] that
[1:26:55] that work of offering sacrifices of
[1:26:58] burning amid the incense amen only the
[1:27:01] children of aaron was able to do so
[1:27:05] amen it was given to them after the law
[1:27:07] was given and many was given to them
[1:27:09] amen they had to do all it was only the
[1:27:11] chief person was supposed to do that
[1:27:14] amen if you're not a chief person you
[1:27:15] try to do that work and then god had to
[1:27:17] punish you they're right there in the
[1:27:19] same place
[1:27:20] amen that's why
[1:27:22] amen
[1:27:23] that's why this king was punished
[1:27:26] amen but when jesus died
[1:27:28] amen he made us chief priest
[1:27:31] amen he made us he made us kings and
[1:27:33] chief priests amen to be able to do this
[1:27:36] work amen to be able amen to pray for
[1:27:39] others and god will heal them amen to be
[1:27:42] able to pray for others and god will
[1:27:44] god will hear our prayer amen to be able
[1:27:46] to pray and to go before him and to
[1:27:48] offer our sacrifices to offer our body
[1:27:51] as sacrifices and god will receive it
[1:27:53] amen that's why he had to die to do that
[1:27:56] to do that
[1:27:57] now why
[1:27:58] why do we have an altar
[1:28:01] amen in our body

[1:28:37] because those toxins it meant they can't
[1:28:39] kill us

[1:29:05] when we leave we see different things

[1:29:10] and and and we think about different
[1:29:12] things that are wrong amen we touch

[1:29:43] spirit a man to come and and to clean us
[1:29:46] amen to come and clean us amen that's
[1:29:49] what the altar was for amen the altar
[1:29:52] was there amen people after doing all
[1:29:54] those wrong women of people after
[1:29:56] stealing and and and doing all those bad
[1:29:59] things and then they were coming there
[1:30:00] so that the altar
[1:30:02] to the altar to kill a lamb so that the
[1:30:04] lamb would take their place and die for
[1:30:06] them amen in other words to clean their
[1:30:10] to clean those uh to clean them from
[1:30:12] things that they did but the blood of
[1:30:14] the lamb couldn't clean them completely
[1:30:16] amen that's why jesus christ died even
[1:30:19] so that when he died he meant to clean
[1:30:21] us amen to change our lives he meant to
[1:30:23] change our nature amen that's why he
[1:30:25] died amen he died on that altar even
[1:30:28] there in recovery he meant to clean us
[1:30:30] and meant to make us pure he meant to
[1:30:32] make us clean and because on the altar
[1:30:35] amen that was the place that you were
[1:30:37] coming in communion with god amen
[1:30:39] because your sins were forgiven and your
[1:30:42] sins amen you didn't have your sins
[1:30:44] anymore amen you became amen you be you
[1:30:46] you come you came in communion with god
[1:30:49] and then the altar was not a place that
[1:30:52] people was coming to justify themselves
[1:30:55] i mean it was not a place that people
[1:30:57] were coming to give reasons amen of why
[1:31:00] they did those bad things even in in the
[1:31:02] altar it meant it wasn't a place where
[1:31:04] people coming to prove where people was
[1:31:06] were coming to prove themselves that
[1:31:08] they were right i mean by the the altar
[1:31:10] was a place that people was were coming
[1:31:12] to humble themselves it meant to to
[1:31:15] recognize that things that they've done
[1:31:17] was wrong even that they did some they
[1:31:19] did some things that was wrong so that's
[1:31:21] why they were coming to the altar amen
[1:31:24] and when we come to the altar amen we
[1:31:26] don't have to come we don't have to
[1:31:27] justify ourselves even when we go to god
[1:31:30] in prayer
[1:31:31] amen we don't go to justify what we see
[1:31:35] amen we don't go to justify we tell god
[1:31:37] that we sin because this brother was out
[1:31:40] of line that's why we say those things
[1:31:42] amen we don't go to god to say that god
[1:31:44] because these things amen because i went
[1:31:47] to work and it didn't work that's why i
[1:31:49] said those things or or i was i was
[1:31:52] fighting against that brother because i
[1:31:54] was nervous or because i was this but
[1:31:56] but we go to god amen amen amen to to be
[1:32:00] humble amen to accept that god we have
[1:32:02] done things that was wrong and we come
[1:32:05] to you god so that you can forgive us so
[1:32:07] that you can cleanse us you know so that
[1:32:09] you can make us clean so that you can
[1:32:13] because you see that in the beginning
[1:32:15] even when adam and eve they seen
[1:32:18] amen they were blaming each other and
[1:32:20] when you see that adam was blaming his
[1:32:22] wife and eve was blaming the serpent
[1:32:25] amen and then but when we come to god i
[1:32:28] mean it's not a time to blame each other
[1:32:29] but it's a time where you come and you
[1:32:32] accept the things that you have done
[1:32:34] amen you you take responsibilities amen
[1:32:37] for the bad things that you have done
[1:32:38] amen and that's that is the only way
[1:32:41] that you can be changed amen that is the
[1:32:43] only way that your that god can change
[1:32:45] your heart that god can transform you
[1:32:48] i mean because the hardest part amen is
[1:32:50] to lay down
[1:32:52] the things that that you don't want to
[1:32:54] lay down let down
[1:32:55] amen is that that's the hardest things
[1:32:58] amen things that you like
[1:33:00] amen these things that you like and
[1:33:02] things that you can't get rid of amen
[1:33:04] that was what the altar was for it meant
[1:33:07] to go to the altar he meant to lay down
[1:33:09] everything that you that you that you
[1:33:11] like those things that you precious too
[1:33:13] much but those same things they meant
[1:33:15] they did they lead you to the wrong
[1:33:17] place amen those the same things it
[1:33:19] might they make you deny god the same
[1:33:21] things amen they make you get
[1:33:23] be away from god amen the altar was for
[1:33:27] so that we can go to god and and lay
[1:33:29] down all those things amen lay down amen
[1:33:32] all those things that are that are
[1:33:33] against the word of god they lay down
[1:33:35] everything amen that that doesn't
[1:33:37] confess the name of god lay it down
[1:33:39] there and burn it amen let the holy
[1:33:42] spirit the fire of the holy spirit burn
[1:33:44] those things in and you become a new
[1:33:46] person it makes you become something new
[1:33:49] i mean that was what the altar was for
[1:33:51] amen the altar was there it meant so
[1:33:53] that we can offer sacrifices
[1:33:56] amen after seeing
[1:33:58] amen every day on our in our lives and
[1:34:00] man every morning every night
[1:34:02] amen know what was going out amen and
[1:34:04] offered the sacrifices it meant for his
[1:34:06] children even for his family even saying
[1:34:09] that god they have been to many places i
[1:34:12] don't know what they have done but
[1:34:13] certainly they have done things that you
[1:34:15] didn't like but lord i come to you lord
[1:34:18] and i offer this sacrifice for them so
[1:34:21] that you can forgive them so that you
[1:34:22] can have mercy for them amen and that's
[1:34:25] the same thing that we're supposed to do
[1:34:27] that every day we go to god and say lord
[1:34:29] i have done many things lord throughout
[1:34:32] the days and throughout the day
[1:34:34] certainly uh i said things that that
[1:34:36] made my brother upset as i said things
[1:34:39] that that wasn't good i said things that
[1:34:41] that i was not supposed to say i saw
[1:34:43] things that i was not supposed to see
[1:34:46] but lord i come to you lord so that you
[1:34:48] can forgive me lord i come to you lord
[1:34:50] so that you can forgive me and change me
[1:34:52] so that i can become a better person so
[1:34:54] that i can become something new
[1:34:57] and then in closing i'll read matthew
[1:34:59] chapter 11 verse 28 to 30.
[1:35:02] the bible says that come unto me
[1:35:04] all you that labor and are heavy laden
[1:35:07] and i will give you rest
[1:35:09] take my yoke upon you
[1:35:12] and learn of me
[1:35:13] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[1:35:16] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[1:35:20] for my yoke is easy
[1:35:22] and my burden is light
[1:35:23] amen god himself is saying that take my
[1:35:26] yoke upon you for i am meek
[1:35:30] and lowly in heart
[1:35:31] amen that's that's how he want us to
[1:35:34] come to him amen with all meekness
[1:35:37] amen with humility amen now boosting
[1:35:40] ourselves for how good we have been or
[1:35:42] because we helped the poor
[1:35:44] that's why you have to come to god and
[1:35:46] both
[1:35:47] all the great things that you have done
[1:35:48] but you have to come to him with
[1:35:50] meekness amen because he says that
[1:35:52] himself is meek
[1:35:53] and lowly in heart
[1:35:55] amen that's how we have well that's what
[1:35:57] that's how we have to come to him
[1:35:59] amen and when we come to him this
[1:36:01] tonight
[1:36:02] amen certainly we have knees as the
[1:36:04] brother brooks was saying in his prayer
[1:36:07] and before praying he named all those
[1:36:09] people who had need and and brother
[1:36:11] orville and
[1:36:12] all the others
[1:36:14] amen all of us have needs amen we have
[1:36:16] things that we've been asking god
[1:36:18] you mean sometimes we don't receive it
[1:36:21] maybe because we don't we don't have the
[1:36:22] right approach
[1:36:24] amen we don't come to god with the right
[1:36:26] approach amen if you seek and you can't
[1:36:28] get well the bible says that if you seek
[1:36:31] the first thing that you have to do is
[1:36:33] confess your sin
[1:36:34] amen you confess your sins amen that's
[1:36:36] the very first step for our healing
[1:36:39] amen you confess your sin and then you
[1:36:41] go to the elders and they will lay their
[1:36:43] hands on you and you will be healed
[1:36:45] amen and the that's that's what the
[1:36:48] bible says amen the first thing first is
[1:36:50] to confess those sins amen for the holy
[1:36:52] spirit
[1:36:53] amen to receive the holy spirit the
[1:36:55] first thing first is to confess our sins
[1:36:57] amen that's the very step that's a very
[1:37:00] that's the first step of everything that
[1:37:02] is godly amen is first to confess your
[1:37:04] sins amen to burn it in the altar of god
[1:37:07] amen to let the holy spirit the fire of
[1:37:09] god amen burn it amen and then you can
[1:37:12] ask god whatever you want
[1:37:14] amen now now when we come to him
[1:37:17] amen you tell him exactly how things are
[1:37:20] amen don't try to
[1:37:22] to
[1:37:23] find words
[1:37:24] difficult words or big words to express
[1:37:27] yourself but just tell him how it is
[1:37:30] amen open your heart to him open open
[1:37:33] your heart to him because
[1:37:34] as i always say that we go to god we
[1:37:37] pray we go to god and the thing that we
[1:37:39] forget is that
[1:37:42] we're talking to a god who knows us
[1:37:44] better than we do ourselves then better
[1:37:46] than we know ourselves amen he knows
[1:37:48] exactly what we have done he knows
[1:37:51] exactly the time and the place and the
[1:37:53] things when that thing happened
[1:37:55] amen but we go to him and sometimes we
[1:37:57] try to hide it we don't want to confess
[1:38:00] it like it is because we we feel ashamed
[1:38:03] of ourselves and we don't want it meant
[1:38:05] that people looking at us as as as you
[1:38:07] men
[1:38:08] that people changing their thought you
[1:38:10] mean how they were looking at us but if
[1:38:12] you really want that blessing or if you
[1:38:14] really want that healing or if you
[1:38:16] really want the holy spirit i mean you
[1:38:18] really have to confess god and also in
[1:38:20] sincerity even because that's the thing
[1:38:23] that god requires the first thing amen
[1:38:25] to be honest to be sincere even even the
[1:38:28] prophet
[1:38:29] and when god told them that if you are
[1:38:31] sincere
[1:38:32] even you you will speak the word and
[1:38:34] that thing will come to pass if you are
[1:38:36] sincere amen the bible says that if you
[1:38:39] look for god you search god in all
[1:38:41] sincerity he will be found amen amen
[1:38:44] it's sincerity is the first thing amen
[1:38:46] if we are honest with ourselves amen we
[1:38:48] are sincere in our hearts amen we
[1:38:50] confess to god and god will certainly
[1:38:53] hear our prayers amen because we don't
[1:38:55] serve a god who gives a word and then he
[1:38:57] has to go after he has to go back on his
[1:38:59] word and change it after but we serve a
[1:39:02] god that when he gives his word and man
[1:39:04] his words remain true even he doesn't
[1:39:06] mind it that doesn't matter the time it
[1:39:08] doesn't matter the place i mean it
[1:39:10] doesn't matter the the hour or how you
[1:39:12] want it but the same word iman remains
[1:39:15] the same but the thing is that we don't
[1:39:17] have the same result even because we
[1:39:20] don't we don't have the same approach
[1:39:22] amen because we don't have the right
[1:39:24] approach amen amen we have to have the
[1:39:26] right approach when we come to god amen
[1:39:28] we have to have faith when you come to
[1:39:30] him amen you have to have faith every
[1:39:33] time you pray you have to have faith i
[1:39:35] mean it doesn't matter how small is your
[1:39:37] faith
[1:39:38] even as long as you have it amen you
[1:39:40] just stick to it i mean it doesn't
[1:39:42] matter how long that thing takes even
[1:39:45] abraham had to wait for 25 years
[1:39:48] and when he had to wait for 25 years
[1:39:50] before seeing his son amen people
[1:39:53] obviously were making fun of him and
[1:39:55] people obviously were laughing at him
[1:39:57] but abraham the prophet says that when
[1:39:59] god gave abraham that promise
[1:40:02] even abraham went to the market
[1:40:05] and when he started buying stealth for
[1:40:06] babies and when he started buying stuff
[1:40:08] for little boys he meant for those socks
[1:40:11] and and things and amen to create that
[1:40:13] atmosphere a man of receiving that baby
[1:40:17] and when the prophet says that when mary
[1:40:19] heard about when mary heard about the
[1:40:21] virgin that would conceive and then she
[1:40:24] went back and she was repeating that
[1:40:26] same word in your heart even in her head
[1:40:28] amen that created an atmosphere that
[1:40:30] that called the angel down amen to give
[1:40:33] her the word that she will be the one
[1:40:35] that will be the virgin that will
[1:40:36] conceive amen it's the atmosphere that
[1:40:38] we create
[1:40:41] that impact the result of the world amen
[1:40:44] we have to have the good atmosphere amen
[1:40:46] as the musician come and
[1:40:49] and when we can sing the song
[1:40:51] amen thank you jesus
[1:40:53] thank you jesus
[1:40:55] amen to create that atmosphere amen the
[1:40:58] atmosphere of prayer the atmosphere
[1:41:01] amen that you can ask god whatever you
[1:41:03] want
[1:41:04] amen and and believe that you will
[1:41:06] receive it amen you can ask god whatever
[1:41:09] whatever whatever is bothering you
[1:41:11] and believe that the same god will give
[1:41:13] it to you amen if we can stand and sing
[1:41:16] the song thank you jesus

[1:41:21] he has done for you in the past amen to

[1:41:25] do for you in the future amen that need
[1:41:28] that you have amen thank him thank god
