TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all what would water come with and make this announcement on Friday as well Amen for those who might want to comment only out a way I'm going I mean even if my wife and I have this drive two cars to carry will be willing to do that just your company and your fellowship would be appreciated also I was thinking just one thing I need to do a cover to that service one thing I need to do is after this time we're going to basically cut back on our visiting preachers only because of financial issues because normally I have to pay the ticket and then we have offering all of that stuff that we have to do with looking back through the year years has been a lot of money so we're just gonna cut back and we may have our brother listening brother Troy and myself kind of working together to keep everything going by the grace of God this brother that's coming now we may take up an offering but it won't be anything that we I'll be doing to cause because I told him I didn't have the money to to give any offering the Sunday and of course he's a past and he's not interested in and offering sometimes we were saying in light of this mm anyway we do thank you for the prayers we talk with our brethren concerning your last service we have we've got everything on one Accord everybody's understanding everybody and I just think by God's grace I need to know them and they need to go meet man but one of the things they did say they really emphasized that they wanted me as a pastor didn't want nobody else not even another Congolese so whatever the will of the Lord is we want it to be done and we've got another group of people coming from Omaha now I don't know how many families but there are several families that will be coming and they're from Nepal a child remember where that was but anyway they live in Omaha been there for a while and have not been able to find a message Church and God showed them our church so I've got a brother coming this week to talk with me between Monday and Wednesday so pray that God's will be done there and be wonderful if the Lord is bringing them here I just see prophecy and name being fulfilled I don't know what God is doing but I don't want to be in his way man you know I want his will to be done and so y'all pray for me and pray for everybody here we just want God to to really intervene here also we have some situations that in my life that I need God to answer to remedy for me if you remember me in your prayers I really would appreciate my god it's great she loved the Lord I mean God is good to us name Amen there's no way that we can express our gratitude my wife just found out she might be travel-size see how she got herself she probably prayed for me Lord every saw his name but anyway hey he was floored they were to be by my I was I was bragging on her over there a shame it's not she's not here for me that to hear it but you know when God gave me is my wife he gave me Oh Jules amen he typed it out by layin a roofie so let's stand by God's grace this coming July night I know our brother Colin had surpassed us in the anniversary spec but I'm excited about my 40-year amen so we appreciate the Lord and she looks really good seeing as she's been with me before I thank God for David I remember the first time when I asked her to marry she say don't be playing with me mr. Brooks I never forget that yeah I would we think for its grace as we stand we want to deter to to passage of Scripture we think of our musician we thank God for so leaders in men you know I don't take things for granted you know and I was just telling I realize if you know I ain't complaining because you know I get up here as a preacher sometimes it seemed like I miss it sometimes as a song lean up come up here and giving my heart out and everybody just what need some shock treatments but nevertheless we keep pressing we can't listen because we know God's will with pitch-perfect will be done amen I have 32 and 2 as s63 appreciate our brunt of this and standing in force and we can make a copy of that service I take one home with me and critique it I'm just kidding I know it good preciate you sir no I think he called me to remind me that I need to listen to it I don't know what I appreciate him calling me I'm gonna miss Joe Allen already text him I'm missing you already and here even with babies and stuff you know that that's gonna be a long time to meet but you know I tell you what I oftentimes think God how can I repay all of you for how faithful you've been since I've been here you know I want to only give all y'all reward so you know only nobody outside I really appreciate everybody really good thank you for your kindness towards me Isaiah 32 and - and it's test and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and uncovered from The Tempest as real as Oh water in a dry place at the shadow of a great rock in a weary land y'all can hear me even men Isaiah 63 3 & 4 I am trodden the winepress alone and other people there was none with me I would track them down tread them in my anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkle upon my garments and I was saying all my raiment but the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is confident let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we just thank you for being so real to us oh god there is no way to express our appreciation and I love toward your Lord as you know our hearts you know our earnest desire is to serve you with all the heart mine and soul father I have no faith or even trust in myself and then but lord I do trust you Jesus and I know that you have promised that the work that you be guarding us you will favor literally Lord that's what I'm standing on and that's what I'm trusting the real forgive us for any actions or thoughts of undelete and then cleanse us from all unrighteousness law yes and bless us tonight in a special way and Jesus Christ's name we pray you may be see here I like to entitle this message crushed crushed I realized something this was inspired when buddy Lujan was here to start I thought about those seeds that had to be crushed wheat or barley whatever it may have been to produce a flower that would make gray you and I know that that's what happened to Jesus yes he was and here's the lily of the valley but in order to enjoy the life of that living it had to be crushed now we are experiencing the opium of the own experience and when we think about being crushed it means to press or squeeze with the force that destroys or deforms and you and I must realize it man that's what God is doing amen it also means to squeeze or pound into small fragments of particles or stone to force out by pressing a squeezing extract for example to crush cotton seed in order to produce oil and we realize by the grace of God you know the probably God described it like this he said you and I must die and rock man and I understand by God's grace that when we click or as a seed planted under the earth that our that world presses on that sea till it breaks it crushes the seed but when the questions are seated also rot but in the mists of that rowdy there is a lot that comes up to the serpent we we see Christ then I don't want to just die I want to be crushed I wanna I wanna I wanna rot yes everything amen so that Christ can be seen in me and I think about Paul when he said it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me and then we can follow Paul's life you know I realize that Paul had to go through some major crushing he had to go through a hardship and in his life wasn't easy in order to exemplify Christ that's all he was interested in that whatever he would go through he would be the reflection of Jesus Christ and coming to understand that we say to ourselves oh my god I got faith let me ever done that and then you find out there's a part of you that not really sure that you've really got to pay we call that the subconscious she not conscious this is what we're seeing right here right here right here and every one of us can testify in our consciousness I believe an amen but I like that scripture says I believe but I'll help my unbelief okay and I believe when that was shared was talking about the conscience of the subconscious because sometimes we can think in one way and will not understand you know that in our subconscious will whip thinking of something else just on this weekend I was speaking to a brother and they came up out of me that I didn't even know was there what was it it was my subconsciousness rehearsing hurts and disappointment that I should have been over with it should have been all the way you know what I'm trying to say man but you see that's what he hinders us amen because in our subconscious we have things that are hidden and sometimes situation bring those things back up to the conscious is that right oh come on somebody every one of us know how to add one plus one but we don't think about that and just situation comes up and they said five plus five oh you show that's kid which is that understanding of that was in your subconscious and when you needed it it came up that's just a way the devil does us especially when we say God I won't the Holy Ghost welcomed in your subconscious you feel like you're not worthy of it you because your shop consciousness and your consciousness must mess up amen hallelujah amen for an example when brother Branham was there Amen designing the people he was not working with their conscience he was able to go into the subconscious yes and find things that were hidden there sub consciousness that they themselves had forgotten but those things that they had forgotten was the very same things that were hitting them on the healing or their faith and once those things were cleared out then God was able to move to God cannot move unless your consciousness and your conscious of subconscious is on one Accord right I believe that's what James said God don't be double-minded P God came back for the double minded man in your consciousness you say I believe but your subconscious is named I'm not sure about that you understand she we can't just walk with a mental conception of this word hallelujah brother Brown said this is will overrule that that cause subconscious will move on you try to walk with the mental conception saying Laura God and I'm healed praise the Lord I'm healed and right down in there this is something saying finally just rules the right away and when your ship to the rise then you say well I just didn't get it t in your subconsciousness you gotta believe which is strike we hear y'all understand me it cannot be Amen where you warring against yourself it must be a solid faith man he said people come up to the platform lots of times law for the Menem I got all faiths but now they believe that in sincerity like on the vision and so forth but God gives it possible then to find where that floor is and Garvin at times how many times God has even warned you in a dream because sometimes when God can't get you in your consciousness he had come to you and your son commenced it right Oh think about Daniel in the king the King dream that dream in his subconscious because that's where you have your dream and it was Daniel Amen God used him to go into that could pop it into that subconscious test and see what the king was dreaming and what was it a warning from God see so God if you can't get you a new consciousness he'll get you in your subconscious now right right it's true right okay you've got three parts of you in that you got consciousness you got sub consciousness and then in your dream is unconsciousness but anyway God will use those things to get to you to show you even where you standing with him many times we we say we have a given an individual but in our sub consciousness we have and when you have it in your sub consciousness in weakens your save because you double-minded man and in your shock consciousness she the Holy Ghost can only go there and help you but many times we don't pray long enough for God to bring up what's getting your subconsciousness Cuba those of you who really really would pray God will show you all the things that you need to make right if you pray long enough man sometimes it may take all night pray but whatever it takes that's what you need to do ah because we won't everything see I'll say it like this and I heard a brother say this but it's true I heard brother Balaam say something similar and I may read it to you but the point is when we think about an iceberg and I think this is the guy who was working with the conscious and the subconscious Ness and I can't remember his name but the iceberg we still iceberg and we said wow that's a big iceberg but you understand that the biggest part of the iceberg is under the water cheap the part that you can see is your consciousness the part that you can't see is the unconsciousness right think about this when the time came and they had that great ship of the Jake Titanic it was almost exactly during that time of the pentecostal moon write shortly after that amen brother Randall was bowling but but but this was a great kind of coaster move it was chart rich increased with Goods right amen and but you see what the Pentecostal people did they would not deal with their subconscious next they dealt with the consciousness or we can speak in tongues and all he's got to think they saw the great wax but they would not they dare to get God in this shut consciousness I thought you had these people that were able to produce all kinds of gifts and signs and wonders but inside of them in the shock consciousness would not allow them to live a holy life and because of that the ship crashed yeah remember God always use shadows and darks God was typing out the Pentecostal truck I really believe that it meant to show that it was going to sink in this life because they increased with glue it and had neat enough head and they thought nobody could say Bishop G but yeah and still God suck the don't you know God still work the same way hey listen people you and I must understand we are composed of body soul and spirit man right and each Austria bill must agree hey you know coming you to get into the holy to home but you yo-yo spirit must be a control and control your body magic see that's the power of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about human up come with the holy gold coming in and controlling here emotion is not so much as jumping up and down let me back up the Holy Spirit will make every movement like Christ it'll make you Christ life the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering God goodness meekness gentleness face to face those things are what the Holy Ghost controls how emotions our emotion is not so much as jumping up and down we can do that ascending with will bring that to you but the Holy Spirit you into operation or in control of God that you walk in peace and love and enjoy with long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience you see it gives us something that you do it's something the Holy Spirit does in you kid is no longer an intellectual part of your own it's a subconscious moving of the Holies oh he said I wish I could shout the praises of God around the world to that cheek that's what we understand a lot of time we psychologically think it our controlling you no no no it's God all that spirit in you and controlling your spirit and that's what we won't ride deep we must understand I said all of that because that in order in order for us to live we must allow the Holy Spirit not just to crush the surface but it must come and crush all of my name everything that's wrong in our spirit it in our flesh we must allow the Holy Spirit to crush it harder to get to the salt in God Christ again right we don't have to soldiers are in doing episode hallelujah we need inside healing before we can help outside healing matter is that right listen people that's the problem people don't get healed because the inside is not healed hey man running or should we think what a shot I got all of us have had complexes but don't you know there must be healed man those thing will keep you from your total deliver ahead yes sir a lot of times we have complex against thought lord I know you say Lord I know you heal no I know you deliver but Lord am I one of them Lord I've been so I I've been so unworthy am I my darling brother madam said that's that's why a lot of Christians don't get healed men because they approach God like that I am unworthy to be here therefore you unworthy to be healed God ain't gonna heat fine because you left your atonement man good never be worthy to be healed amen if y'all Tommen is Christ in you man that makes you were not you know me huh how many you have only go no sir none of us our word is God's gift that's why he can talk because we could never measure up to it better we accept Christ crucified ah I go back to the course because I knew that's where the power audience err hallelujah how deep this message other brother the other day I said when God before he could open the seals but if you see you saw a bloody lair you had to understand why the shield could be open in order before they could be open apply them I am slave before the foundation of the way you don't acknowledge the level of remember the Calvary they come in this message and they want to go all the way up to the top you got to pick up your cross and follow him you must understand what it means to be rusev up you gotta meet guarding all around the pantry yes thank you a man should be a hiding place and that's my hiding place in Christ's sheep right keep tread the winepress alone man given the one crushing everything hallelujah will help me somebody the Bible said there was nobody there to help him I thought about Jesus and I said Lord when they crucified Him you know what they did then he stained his own garments with his own blood but this time around a man is 50 amen he was saying his garment a guy but it'll be the blood of his enemy Marit hmm now many times I read this and I thought I understood it Philippians 2:5 says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God let me change some God is not double mind God has one mine his mind is God's minds right right now how you don't get God's mind without dying you got to die have you got a rock you got to be willing to surrender everything to God you can't hold it back hallelujah oh come on somebody I believe with Christians but my point is where are we are we are in the outer court MA the Air Corps many of the holy the Holy See Christians but you got you gotta try me and each journey requires a greater commitment on your part teachers all right a professor on Jesus Christ from a lollipop you know in confessional about all that's good and it right then when you do that you'll hear your pass from death to life but you don't stop dead man named the Holy Ghost must must bring you to a seekers I hated to them a lot of time we don't know that we got the dirt in us into the Holy Ghost God's mad hallelujah sometimes you know I don't know what you're used to watch my mom and my chef you should wash clothes with our own handle that report sometimes it look like this thing would be easy to get up and oftentimes they thought you thought it would be easy United what so easy then you have to buy more detergent and more pressure but if you wasn't careful you rub a hole in your thumb I'll rub the color out of it so but God is not that way God will get all the stain out of the eye I don't know about you people but I need work on menace you know I'm not going to pretend that you know I'm exactly what God want me to be but I know one thing I'm gonna journey hey and I'm not going to stop in this journey until I'm just like you no matter what the cost no matter what your tip let it take out okay I use that term I don't care but I do care I want everybody to go if I gotta go by myself you understand me and people are like when you say that but the truth is you would always must have that attitude you gotta have that attitude I'm going in Ojai is that all right and now he trying to rock listen let this mind be in you being in the form of God thought it not proud to meet with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant I was made when life is a minute a lot of time we don't see that we don't see this part made himself of no reputation because we find out that even in in its message seem like that's what their issues that's what their goals are to make a reputation well how can that be Christ it's not like I said you look at this detail in it later and it just says swept for the Church of them and everything and people are looking at it and still blind that this thing is a deed that has turned into a doctrine that is also turning to me and now we worship me hello we give more credit to the creature than we do the Creator is some of y'all don't know what I'm talking about but I'm working with experience I've seen it and there's only one kingdom and that's the kingdom of God and that's what he interest to hear I'm not interested in a great name or big something like that you know I'm repented from a lot of things that I've done in the past all amen in those things I see myself being manipulated and misled by people who I thought were great ministers of God I got my focus now there's only one person that needs to be exalted now that's Jesus amen right made himself of no reputation being found and fashioned as a man he humbled himself and came obedient unto death even the death of the cross now you saw what do you mean brother bridge was Peter dead to himself but Peter dad to himself Peter said when God said is your time to go back to be crucified he said okay I'll turn around but law I'm not am unworthy to be crucified like you turn me upside down I think he perhaps was the first in history to get turned upside down I don't know but I just know one thing he saw himself more that he he was so so so much the last thing cried he just didn't want anyone equal to it I cannot be crucified like my Lord was crucified y'all you're insane see my thing is you know I look at those disciples and their behavior to tests and trials and persecution and I look at our age uncle then how we we go with the test for trials and here we suppose have a double portion or not that means slow funky down out there they were even a traveling go wherever God say go they could care less about this world that's my dog holla people who is trained now how can that be the same as we are we don't behave this amen amen yes sir that's exactly what it is but you see God is trying together oh he goes triplets folks amen all is calm for to God you better your God cause it's coming God's gonna take everything away from you and you would have to prove that's right not to God does he know who you are but you know how to prove who you are this pride I tell what you think oh it's your suite is just Lily that's your problem we just been giving us so much honey a man and not enough it'll stop Ginny can realize billing has come to this mission you need to cry you need to cry and wail sometime before the Lord hallelujah desperation he preached he said if you don't get desperately he said you're gonna miss it that's what he said and desperation a shop that you can call but I can tell you one thing you get before God and cry out to it how to bring that spirit on you we can't assume that we have walked into the Holies of Holies and our life is displaying something doing on your life will tell you what you do not a man wherefore God has a calling he talk to them and give him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every nation in Shiva and I look at those things and Ricky said well praise God the bride has become him don't you know what you say that means if you have become here every knee must Batman every tongue must affect to the Jesus Christ and you have only inside him nothing's your standing your wig that is that when he told the Prophet nothing just telling your way he shares the same thing to the rod nothing shall stand in your way if you can get the people believe ma but the problem with believing nowadays is we got too much junk in our subconsciousness and we're not willing to get rid of hallelujah and you gotta be willing all they hurt be back you 10 years ago and brother said yes to me that's gotta be uprooted Oh gotta come out of it is just falling you mad and it must come out yes Amen hallelujah you know everything you can you know every how you know something in you because you'll pop yo yo yo mouth is gonna tell amen that's what I said it up brother so oh my god I apologize to him I said you know what see God was preparing me for this message I'm so glad I came out because now I know where the devil is ha ha you can I could by turn heart I got me to it ha only the pure heart see God hallelujah and therefore any man be in Christ he is what a new creature men that worst means he is a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new and that's what a real birthday hey not so many things on you oh hey a new creation for a new creation or new creature or new creation we can't make it into that world like this it's got to be changed and the Bible treasures no unclean ain't nothing that with your power city will be there so folks we got to meet God everything that wasn't under the token god man you got a plane if your life is not under the blood you work hard hallelujah there's a resurrection to a seat that never died termatrac if there's no resurrection we're gonna have to get desperate we don't have to understand we got to be crushed when lord whatever it takes crushed us money max heaven is my home how do you one thing I don't have a doubt about I am predestinated to maintain somehow that revelation let me tell you something I am willing to go through whatever to get the head however the master would oppress me squeeze hurt whatever he's gotta do I play ah yes sir oh you know I don't know weight you know the Weig I don't know what's real yes you know and also whatever it takes to get me there doing okay I might have to cry and the pain may be excruciating but whatever it takes I know at the end of this thing I'm gonna have a rainbow around hallelujah think about it look what Daniel saw then you saw the same thing she somehow you going to be crushed if you don't all of the rock the rock won't fall again that was it and the Bible said that the rock falls on you it would grind you to power man hammer yeah right you know something brother brother out Yvonne was preaching and and I went back and looked it up in here we were talking about that choreography you know when the great when the seed came down like man you know all all this time I thought it was just bread but you know they had to crush that see to make flour to make bread she that's what Jesus was to see but yet his filly said I am the brave because you knew that he would be crushed one day and break all a thing that would produced prayer living bread right and then you think about he said man you hold this over to the next day and we know what that here's denominational hell that read over and it rotted indistinct but he said listen he said on the sixth day he said imma give you double courses that's right I'm gonna give you enough for the six thing and we'll give you enough with the seventh day so you won't have to go out and run forward he heard of course it does not what the message did for us and we don't have to run for it it's already here we need to eat grubbing on enemy Oh slower the government is not hunting forth then you're in trouble because God wants you to rest on the seventh day Christ hallelujah and you hadn't gotten there yet until you can rest in your salvation amen amen you still know I don't know if I'm saying I don't know what I'm incorrect you ain't at rest no and then when you are at rest the devil assistance is scared of you because he knows no matter what he tries to do to make you doubt you won't but you've had an experience are you dead how could you talk if you'd a man Christ lives in your head nobody's gonna rock shrub the world was queued up without him and the whole image of the system would broke down and become like chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind packed it away I thought about that and I look up that threshing floor some of y'all may know what it is but it was the way they did they even have machines now and what they wanted to get an instrument or something to show you but stretching floor instruments they had different instruments how that's called um or what you call it just a bit it it's called um flater f l8 I am frame trailer not Freya is FF l a I L clinically but anyway they had instrument and it would have a stick on it and you may have seen in the middle and live every day because some people use it as a as a fighting weapon and it would have this chain and it would have a ball on it and they will beat the weak like this so understand God had to beat you and harmony we are they will beat you Hank right to get to shuck away in all that I believe that is not right and so they were beated also the heck sar1 like a stick and that stick would just be I look at all of you too so if you want to go look at it later you beat that that that that we in the shop and the scene was separated and did they would never take that Sh um some of the farmers would take remains you all's chaff and all that I don't like but still you had a little bit of stuff left and then they would put you in a machine that would shift you and it will separate the rest of the chaff from you see that's what God does with the church here Peter John can get all that chat out of that I mean at the end of the day would it look like the devil and I could get the bitchin no he's not God is separating the rest of that stuff and it remained the sheen remains hallelujah and it's stealing over yet because to see you've got to be cross in order to bring horsepower but me or whatever for the making of the breath it has to be crossed that's what that's what that's what then is solved things they like the child or the summer fetch info and then when packing it away so that's why when you see people moving it and all of a sudden a moving in groves that's not we're just sweeping through moving all those all those make believers out the way all right hallelujah and the rock itself grew into a mouth listen and the wind pack it away and and the rock itself grew into a great mountain that covered the earth what watch the mountain now the mountain cover the earth also we find here in Revelation here he said the kings of the new earth will bring their honor and glory into it in the earth see the New Jerusalem is sitting on this earth it's just changed so you should what you mean he says see you're the same man it statue that you was when God called you same woman but you see what it did it was regenerated Nicodemus you must be born a tea the old life pass away the all desire has passed away and when you used to like to drink and cuss and fuss it's due and run around and amaura that that thing just died cheap and then you would say this disparate now you are a deep man right and that's what the world would be the same way redeemed a new heaven and a new earth come on now you understand what he's saying if God please your evening with no demon no devil no nothing would ever show up again what about us I believe that's right brother brother said the bride will become so much like him and they won't know what to do it hi that's a lie I need your pretense it is a lie but you know what it comes by surrendering to me oh yeah we must surrender man don't surrender God I sure in the help me surrender hallelujah you are a new creature and the Greek word there in my nose head you are new creation amen she we we're not a pastor job if you feel passed up you need to get back down to the altar cuz God didn't come to patch you up man your flesh is not supposed to be ruling you head you supposed to be ruling your quest we're far down the road folks coming er me prayer now we all need prayer for we all need prayer now much Gasol I mean I don't know but all I know is God is looking for honey push hey spot and I want to give him all of that I'm determined full-time determine by God's grace she's given me determination she that's what Paul said it took Christ be formed in you Christ must be formed in you and that's a process he's forming himself in you right and when he completely forms himself in you you're now standing as a perfect man in the statue of Christ and then exemplifying or reflecting the divine nature of God amen God cannot fall that's why that's good too saying you will never fall hey I admit cuz God can not ain't wrong yeah listen you show all brother what he's saying I'm saying let God crush you don't the budget thinking that strange right when divers temptation try you know that the try is the trying of your faith huh is trying you yet just to see reading you man ah hallelujah guys don't feel good anybody nobody to this day to day troubles now but nobody enjoy beating absolute you and I must understand the ear product yes what is going to predict there is no way that you won't be a true Christian and not suffer and running so far even for things that you you haven't even done that's true alright something for things that you you you you you you're not to blame but you suffer anyway right when you having it - good God and make a man loud on you Oh [Music] y'all know that's the scripture Lord told me those false witness have we seen Daniel and I Jane what Daniel was disobeying you know they were telling the truth but they were lying in the sense that he was doing evil - I don't care what y'all say I'm talking about ghosts are a life I wish everybody had that out he said now according relations now I say that the air as long as he's a child different nothing from the servant though he be Lord of all how many austere children but is under tutors and governors into the time appointed for the Father amen even so we will be our children were in bondage into the elements of the world whoa but when the fullness of the time was come God ship of the Sun and made of a woman made under the law to what to redeem them that were under the law that we

with if I'm talking about man admit when I'm wrong I'm wrong I just want to be right right is this okay this is boomer talk about how that threshing and you know we all receive our own individual Thresh separating ourselves on the weed in the world that's what about it being separate from the world and the things of the world you know you can't have the world and God at the same time is always a separation you know the mean and and listen folks ever take something to wheel he is neat cutter the will of a man is sneaking off your will cross like a surf man sometime you don't even know he's there cuz he is here he's go so small you know you think you writing a will of God and then all of a sudden at the intro you will to come up in you got me trouble alright that's why you doesn't God I tell you what I'm talking about from experience your will is something else you think you all right or I'm gonna go to the grocery store and back in the mind something else is working in your

honest I'm just telling you I know when I go through it and y'all go through it to be on that same kind of our flesh nice oh god help us love it listen Jeremiah 51 and I'd only be too much longer okay so that says a lot of holes the God of Israel the daughter of belt on is like a threshing floor it is time to Thresh her yet under the law and the time ago harvest shall come so what do you say listen let me sit like this you and I know that we were in the last days I was telling somebody the other day he was always there Cooper was coming gets already on it's just having explaining itself yet it never reached a peak of it yet but it's already doing the for all is in law we're in the beginning of this thing and give education where is the coming of the law cuz brother been said before one barn brought she'll be gold you look where we are but I'm gonna talk about the California earthquake and sorry you said Amen the export out there by Washington is loaded it can cook anytime hallelujah so where are we because he said listen he said aged and the resurrection of Jesus Christ he said I was a great earthquake and he ties that into the sixth seal to the coming of the Lord the rapture of the bride this California earthquake and what a time if they're gonna send a bomb that's the time in sinning because who gonna know who's missing he said he looked around and he saw cradles everywhere do you think of a national a catastrophe would happen in America that Russia gonna run away and help us what about North Korea he more than likely this in a bomb to keep the charge from coming their way all those bodies going to be floating on the water everything folks listen maybe it's my imagination but I tell you what we like we need to be like Ruth Ruth assault is the harvest time and they only told us saying you know go ads over at the Treasure Coast you go over there and ladies you should I'm saying and I thank God a boy asks that you just continue to Liddy at rest and I'm going to take care of the rest man see that's how it is she surrendered all she had she surrendered a reputation she surrender everything she could care less and not you if boys had not responded to her the right way she could have been put to death Center a man but she had wanted one thing and that was a kinsman she wanted a DVD when you really want to be redeemed go the extra mile when we are denying yourself lay down at boys feet and say come in with your gum and head hallelujah amen I need your ownership hallelujah I need you cheese and that's what God wants trust for that to happen it up so to need him you love the Lord and can I get one more thought say John sixth what it went 51 the Jews didn't murmur at him because he said I am the bread which came down and they said is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that you say I came down to heaven Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourself no man can come to me except the Father which I've sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day we don't get discovery we shouldn't get discouraged if you see this message they can't see pictures can't a man yeah it doesn't mean they out of it all together maybe them in another part of God's you know economy I don't know but my point is you already so great for the Concord yet realize to see yes sir because I will change something you can teach a man all day and get him up side of here it ain't going to open his eyes only God the only thing we can do is create a dollar in their article you can not over the prismatic you cannot give them revelation revelation only comes from God amen you love the Lord amen I hope you're getting something tonight both we need those are hallelujah think about myself I said

believeth on me and everlasting life I am the bread of life your father did eat manna in the wilderness and we are not there this is the bread which coming down from heaven that a man eat thereof and not die right you find in the scriptures they had to take that coriander seed and and like a pro se to ground it up and make great right now Jesus been grounded up he is the bread he was and he is hallelujah he was the seed of God that had to be crushed so here we are doing what now how abri he's eternal greater man for this message has been him for a while man yeah and he's getting better all the time ain't none of it Ronnie none of it can rock man y'all you I'm saying it's right in the hole is a hole halle-loo so you understand if people get tired of this message they're eating shrew bread outside of the day honey Katie the real stuff because I will tell you something one thing about this message if nobody understands anything I say like this this message for you to understand me takes you beyond Jesus are they doing it up thank you right to the top yes Shiva wasn't because one thing we must understand that the Holy Spirit is in you that's the father yes sir jesus said I came in my father's name amen now go back to him and I come back what see that's what people understand a to Holy Spirit's there's only one the same Holy Spirit said let there be light in here well yeah right this is a Holy Spirit for the theophany for the word right hallelujah in the same geography came down to the person of a Kennedy hallelujah and then one day mechanic became Jesus oh yeah that's why Jesus was made after auto mechanic because mechanic was in here because because of a clause and yield car amen amen and then it because of that it wasn't his dog but get like it's in you that's right hey no beginning of that's what he told I said we have not a high priest to cannot be touched by the field off from furmity who you think is hot fries did Jesus many amen it was what's Makassar dead singer I can read you a quote here that might might really shock you let me see can I find the door closed you love the Lord and make sure it's safe for another day I just I just word like Road madam said he said Jesus was God let me find it and then he said let me find you so I could read it just right hello I'm just trying to find this and I should have marked it but I did God is good to us and I just want to thank you for being so good to anything it's a beautiful quote and I know some people are gone and they ran off way to trying to make God - God is not - God is one I don't care how you say it he's still one right right I really believe that if you understand the oneness of God you understand the oneness of God in you see but a lot of times people don't understand how God and God cause you word it so till it makes people stumble trying to figure it out you know within themselves yeah they came fighting that means you don't want me to read it that's the way I look at it for tonight but I think I thank God for His grace okay here well here Hank he says now remember we are not the word but we are the word uh-huh now you got it Jesus was not God but he was gone manna he was a man yet he was God she knows what did gay understand they can he could cry and yet he was raised to death he could cross four men being dead and raise him back of a game he was over doric over Akko and that's Vanessa he was your over all completely he was your over and yet he was a man he all the world and make Earth had not a place in his head hallelujah he said the person that made him got this and I haven't got a place to lay my head the bosses that I created has holes and grounds and I have even knocked out one myself even to be buried that's right you had to borrow somebody's grave to be prepared in either the gaining everyone there was a woman he had no home to be born in he had tomorrow a woman he created the earth and not a place to bury her he had to borrow a hole in the ground to be buried in scheme Jehovah Joseph Ameri Thea has a burial place yet he was God and drew that he was God now you understand it we are not see we are Messiah but not that Jesus he is our Father we were just annoyed with the spirit and that's to read in his life yeah and that get people seeing of you don't sit and think through it get people to believe well this guy would be a mystery the Messiah sure here this one here could be they both are see well how can there be two a film he said there thousands of them hallelujah this one Oh II am could be and they both are she uh well how can there be two of them two thousand of them but you see his life is separated on the day of Pentecost and when the purifier comes down came down here separated like tons and set up on each of them God invited themselves for mocking people because the church and Christ is one just as husband and his wife is one see I love that man ah like I said in that day with a kid there nobody can't count they all named cheese edgy I don't know what his name on a people they said that the Word of God said when we go there Sophia do name hon more glorious than Jesus that message is questioning this is number 360 for question and answers 830 64 we're blessed because we being stuck in an organization or denomination and I'll tell you what until you truly born again you and yourself as a denomination but you got one one one thought a thought pattern it's not a god that was overrule God's Word man so you got to make sure you're born again become one with you amen and you know because that's the power to domination they will add their own location and change God's words right hallelujah you love the Lord God fix this thing so perfectly brother with sisters we we don't have no excuse ego to bring us through all I love the Lord Amen I'm so grateful because I trust you yes all I can say man you know I have no human f I have no effort I have no no no no where they skate out to faith and whatever it takes God to do to cleanse all that need to be cleaned out of me I want him to do a people matter you know I can see some of the beatings we all go through it or whatever it takes - if you gotta beat this mo betta Simone I wanted to crush my soul I am yes I can be seen it right I don't want to die with my life all the die with you is like a man right because of a down his life I won't pass any magazine for living like I was said it tells about I'm closing people say well they say God my brother balance it he ain't dead he's right but you know what Jesus told us how that works he said Lazarus is sleeping and the Bible said the people didn't understand what he was talking about him and then he brought it to their terms Lazarus is dead so it all depends on where you're looking Booya but there is a grave with a man's body down there like it was with Lazarus and there's a man up there like it was with Laughing Man y'all you I'm saying so it all depends on your terminology or what you think about but William Branham in this body part is dead measure in his spirit of soldiers alive hey I'm wonderful so with the reason why I said that the car a lot of people almost use him as a mediator they don't say it right but they do I'm so glad for Paul and I'm so glad for brother Brandon amen you know why because brother Brennan said I preached it just like Paul and Paul said I don't need to know nothing say Jesus Christ hey is that too tough no sir no I came how they spend it with people too when he go ride this trail again what you think he doing he who remember when they said Moses tell my Malta's he said 'keep moses he knowses right he explained any Moses doing it I'm doing it how would you help doing that well we know love Moses loop read the scripture Jesus caught that carnality and then he had to tell them no my father ain't mad because it's always been my father whenever Moses and my father using motive matter right that's just good to Moses I have come down to deliver my people people get all nervous but I'm a Jason I know it's a fine line and God knows I know what I'm saying amen that's right you know but you got to realize that people that con man because their carnality they take it to a common place and you can't do that and worship God that's what the prophets said I believe that brother Fredo when he said when John fell down to worship and he said no no I'm your servant of the prophets get up from there worship God hang on that's right I believe that was brother Brennan that's right because out of between Paul and brother brother had a script here call say you you you receive Jesus Christ himself man you would have plucked your eyes I've had me so Paul head and deal with the same kind of stuff that's great just like GTECH brother l had to deal with Oh me if we go please just message we must preach it away brother Brownback give it all forward to the Lord I don't know what you know you'll never say well you can't say brother brems lame in here you don't know if we say that but my point is and all that I say I realize what's coming from hey man that's what you need to know you love God and I am we're fortunate let's stand we're fortunate I don't know how else to say it I think about all of the people that I just seem to be you know getting confused and falling away I don't even understand how people leave this and go back to denominations Ixtapa I don't understand yours you know I'm not boasting like I'm something cuz I know it's just a grace of God but it's never been in me I tell you what folks if I had to leave this I go back into the world you will find me in no church because you know what I know I'm a I'm worshiping to them you know what I'm saying why go in another Church you know and remember say that's what they do it cuz see this is the hour you must worship God in spirit and in truth you go to the you know what wakes people out of an organizational ISM his election ma'am out of her locket man yeah that's what brings them out but before they come out this thing they worshipping God when I'm not now those who got a true Holy Spirit I might make this Agreement feel their brother Brendan said you can be hatched under a cheeky amen amen hungry get a ready I really do that means I could go in a denomination if they got the spirit hard enough God can quicken America because one thing we know it's just still the same or engineering if the doctrine that makes a man you love God and your and some of them got some deals too but some you owe me I'm happy I'm really happy I'm really happy in God you know I get a little weary and tired with all of the things we have to go through one thing for certain Allah but when I think about that cross he carrying that cross and is tired and weary too weak he can't move baggage I'm not gay he'll put moving with it - no matter if it takes me to my knees will keep your eye your grace [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know I want to say this I say a lot of things by God's grace but I know we see Allah I believe that we see this message correctly but a lot of times I say things to emphasize just because you never know when you say to my car you know what a thought that you can't get with and I want people know where I stand [Music] God given us grace to see the truth of this word in this message great that's how good a prayer will be dismissed Heavenly Father we thank you crush us for a there's a final loo final sweep of the whole experience you promised the slow Lord we're looking for a thank you sure oh Jesus when you don't forget about don't pass right look beyond a we are the word of this game because you spoke it we enjoy in your word because that day that job where was a when the sons of God shouted for joy we've done it man oh you know smart we can relate to this message you spoke we hear it today we remember we know it's true same counting on you Jesus also with the pinion to see us through long in your name or change gradually you as the true Jesus Christ there [Music]
