TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen amen I thank I thank God every time I sang that song for our precious brother Randy who God inspired to write it I do I really do I've seen God come down I my first time singing that song it was in uh in uh actually in that's New York they at the women's Retreats I tried to say but the power of God come down just on the for seeing God move on that song whenever God's moved that mean he's pleased so I thank God for that in Jesus name you love the Lord oh what can I say God is good to us we're not going to be long tonight Lord willing I hate saying that I'm GNA try to stop saying that cause I want to get away from all the Traditions I think that's one of the things that are that is uh Hind ing uh uh the the move of God uh it traditions and customs and whatever more but you know I was thinking about uh God today in heaven and uh I I you know I often wonder what it's going to be like because you know it's going to be so different from this place and you know I'm so glad that's the way it's going to be because I really would be disappointed if it was to be like this place I'm looking for a better City I'm looking for a greater City whose King is the Lord Jesus Christ let us turn to Malachi 4 and then we'll go to Hebrews 11 I think that's where I want to take you Malachi 4 had a wonderful time I I I I think it was my better time I that the best time of of uh anniversary time I don't know how my wife feels about it but I truly so enjoyed myself I told her it was perfect amen everything went so well we even met up with my son he surprised us and took us to Miami put us in a honeymoon suite overlooking the bay took us shopping it was a real blessing amen I I know it was a sacrifice for him but you know nobody he he did it because he wanted to and I thank God for that and uh everything went went really well uh brother uh Wesco had meetings I got all the services on on a stick so I just got to get up to brother Troy maybe you can put him on the CD or whatever you put him on I'm telling you I'm telling you the greatest word I've ever heard that's all I can tell you I can't even tell I'm like oh my God I think I studed the same messages but I don't go there but God is so good it was so wonderful people I'm telling you it it just no words can explain explain it it's just a time and season that we're living in Malachi 4 we're going to start reading by the grace of God uh 5- six Behold our sin you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse okay let us turn to Hebrews 11 please Hebrews 11th chapter 5ifth through sixth verses I've got somebody's Bible I don't know whose Bible it is but uh I'm using it and it's been really good so if you had a Bible like this I'm missing one there's no name in it lot of notes but anyhow by the grace of God let us turn to uh Hebrews 11th chapter we're going to read the fifth verse and sixth verse by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he plead God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your love we pray father that you will move upon the tabless of our hearts speak to your people Lord speak to us all we come father not because we are forced to come but it we come with a free will a free desire to love you and to know more of you and to hear directly from your throne father bless each and every heart here tonight forgive us father if there be anything we may have said or done throughout the day that would hinder your moving tonight cleanse us from all Wicked Ways and thoughts we ask these things in your precious and lovely name Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I'd like to uh entitle this message and I know you may not be able to uh think about which way I'm going with this at first but I like to uh entitle this message where are the Believers where are the Believers we understand by the grace of God that uh the word of God tells us without faith is impossible to please God we have come through seven Church ages we have come at a time when the earth is cursed not about to be cursed the Earth is cursed judgment is setting in rolling in and it's really picking up pace we realize we come in a time and brother bam described he said every messenger comes at the end of every age we realize by the grace of God that our Prophet came at the end of Leia not the beginning the end matter of fact in 5657 he preached a message H indictment and he indicted the United States uh uh for being guilty of crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ a second time we see by the grace of God and I want to bring things to your mind because the Bible tells us that Titus rode into Jerusalem 70 years after the death of Jesus Christ you see Jesus had already foretold that Jerusalem would be destroyed before his crucifixion he was there in the Mount of Olives crying out oh Jerusalem oh Jerusalem I would have hovered you as a chick in her Brew but you would not now we it is not a coincidence that we come to the same place in Los Angel and the same voice that called out on Mount in the Mount of Olives or uh there crying over Jerusalem is now crying over the United States and says oh uh capernium capernium Los Angeles Los Angeles I would have hovered You Now understand amen if there had not been a second crucifixion there would have never been another crying out for the people but here the same Holy Ghost is crying out or crying over the nation of America because we were founded or started just like the Jews were amen running and finding a place of for freedom of religion but now the whole America have basically turned their backs on God they want to do redefined him amen and and they want to forget about his laws they want to forget about his word and and when you become a lawless nation in which we have become we're in trouble as the prophet of God said if God don't judge America for her Deeds he will have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize and we'll be be that but oh my you and I are in a worse condition a more critical condition of our say because the Bible says to whom much is given much is required we have come in a place where God the Bible said God used to wink at ignorance but he no longer wik at ignorance why because the knowledge of the truth have been given but we took that same blood and we trampled it under our feet and I want to say by the grace of God I read those scriptures because I want to know where are the Believers now here we are in an age where the Bride of Jesus Christ is typed out as Enoch and the Bible said that Enoch so believed God he walked with God Amen and he had a testimony that he was translated think about it he was so walking in in the way that God wanted him to walk that he did not see death God took him and we had a prophet in our day that came and said the Bride of Jesus Christ is like Enoch matter of fact he said that she'd be so much like him amen that he she will literally pull him down out of heaven where are the Believers we find out that even in the days of Noah when he came what they did not know at the that Noah was uh one of the Major Prophets of of his day and and and and he come at the end where God had come to a place where he was sick and tired of sick and tired of being sick and tired if you want to say it he had put up uh with the people and their complaining and their murdering and their gambling and their stealing and their cheating and their hatred amen he had put up with that long enough and the Bible said that even so God it repented God that he made man but Noah found Grace you know it's got to be bad when the word of God has to put it in there like that that it repented God when god is perfect all right amen but you find out that God found one man by the name of Noah who had Faithfully kept his seed right his family amen perhaps was the only one left that was had married their own kind and I mean believe believer with a Believer y'all hear what I'm saying never mixed his seed with the world now we can't say that about his sons but Noah found Grace in the eyes of God hello somebody now we find out that if they had only been Believers and the Bible tells us that only eight Souls out of those Millions were saved I'm coming people because we realize that we're in a in in the same situation well you know what what Satan has done and let me put it this way Satan don't care if you come to church Satan don't care if you pay your tithes Satan don't care if you preach sing shout or whatever as long as you don't come as long as you don't get the Holy Ghost say he don't care he'll let you come Faithfully he'll let you be religious he'll let you be traditional he'll let you be whatever you want to be as long as you don't seek and receive the Holy Ghost he don't care he'll make you think you saved he'll make you think you're going to make a Rapture he'll make you think and listen if God would not accept a uh Cain's sacrifice without blood he's not going to accept your sacrifice without it either and the only blood that can be accepted in this day is the blood of Jesus Christ y'all hear what I'm saying now we look at this thing and I'm saying these things because we we people they they say we're Believers I'm a believer I'm a Believer but believing is more than singing shouting speaking in tongues you know the devil can do all of that but one thing I can say about the devil he is a Believer probably more of a Believer than some Christians the coming of the Lord is near where are the Believers you take a person like Rahab Rahab the Harlot who not had not even seen a miracle but had heard what God had done in Israel right the spies came and I'm going to tell you something what this message come to do do for us this message come to give us a total deliverance and I'm going tell you something you will not make a Rapture until you totally Delivered come on somebody that is the truth I don't know why people think they going to make it on 99 and a half but a 99 and a half won't won't do but anyway totally delivered now it didn't say you be free of temptation but totally delivered is that right come on the scripture tells us that we must be delivered totally delivered let's put it in This World Overcomers of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life that's that's it and this message come to give us that now here the word of God tells us that that here uh Rahab she had a choice to make RAB had a choice she could have not hidden the spies or she could have exposed them but she heard that these people serve the true and living God now I want you to put yourself in rahab's position RAB I want to tell you something we're going to destroy all the inhabitants of Jericho now there's two ways of looking at it said but we're going to save you because she said all I ask of you is that you saved me in my house but I want you to see what God did for for uh H Rahab not only when he was destroying Jericho he destroyed her past reputation he destroyed all of her Witnesses oh come on somebody he destroyed all of her enemies hello he wiped out everything of rahab's past and she never had to look back and there was never one person who could say I know her from Jericho why amen God made sure her record was clean now that's the choice she made she made a choice because she didn't want to be halfway delivered she didn't want those same Devils coming back up in her life saying well oh you think you something now but I remember what you used to be she didn't want that she literally gave everything over now I want you to understand wasn't just rahab's family there Rahab had friends but I'm going to destroy your friends oh come on you cannot tell them what I'm got I'm going to do cuz the word would get out come on somebody Rahab God even separated her from her friends and some of us don't want to do that but if you want Total Deliverance because God knows what those old friends will make you do hello somebody amen the Bible said Enoch walk with God now think about it there was nobody other other than Enoch and God showing that in this last day it is a individual walk you and God and God alone right but he said don't worry you'll never be forsaken you'll never be alone I will always be with you even in you to the end of the Earth you know what we don't realize when it comes to being starch and stiff how God hates that he hates it he hates it we don't we don't we we we fail to see that you know we have fallen that Spirit of Le SE fight you every day every time you come to church that that same Le spir seal Spirit comes he gives you every reason not to move not to dance not to shout that ain't it ain't all that but Satan will make sure you come become stiff and starchy you don't even know it's happening and all he's trying to do is say you're dying you're dying right cooling the fire that God liveit you're dying and you don't even know it help us Lord listen it is the truth if you see how God orchestrated the things for Israel you'll realize that God when he coming to battle and whether you realize it or not this is a Battleground the greatest battles F in your mind but coming to church is a Battleground we are fighting demons and I'm the captain saying charge what happen if I got an army of people I'm said charge and you look around like you talking to me but that's the kind of response we get from people you go about your feelings I don't feel like it don't you know if you just raise your hand the anointing of God will come down and make you feel better now I'm a witness because I've been there I've seen it happen to me too many times you know let me tell you something what I hate I like I I I the internet is good and evil the internet is good and evil come on somebody now why you say that brother Brooks because I say it like this if I'm the pastor of the church right and I guarantee you most of you probably don't go home and listen to my message twice but you can go on the internet and you can flirt with another preacher because everybody else does it and you fail to see you can't have two heads and you fail to see that what that devil does is start like a like you're in a in in your intimacy it'll began to compare me oh come on somebody with the other man is not a good thing I'm telling you but we do it are there see Satan knows what he's doing now cuz one flock has one Shepherd there's not two or three Shepherds only one but we fail to see amen that when we do those things it's not pleasing God you might say oh I got something good so to E I hardly have the time enough to listen to brother brandom and I I try to do that almost every day but you know I'm just saying and I don't know that's not even my notes but I was made to throw it out anyhow now we look at this thing and we find out by the grace of God Amen that a lot of times we are playing with with with an enemy and we don't really know it why because you don't know if God ordained a man to be your pastor and you listening to somebody else you don't know whether he going to turn out to be a dayon or a caller hello Moses was their pastor and the 7 that God ordained Dayan and cor popped up guess what happened and caused their lives might be hard enough but I'll put it this way at least I know I'm giving you something that'll make get you crossed over amen if if you only listen if we only can find some people with some faith not only in God but in the man that God ordained she will not get anyway if you don't follow the leadership of the pastor come on somebody and it's true is that right I was thinking about that today I said I thank God for my wife you know we've come a mighty long way you know what I mean hello it's getting sweeter all the time but what kind of a man I would be if my wife ruled my house what kind of a man I would be if I let the church rule me hello confidence in what God is doing and has done come on somebody let me move on Hebrews 10 and you don't think I'm wrong try to stop it try to break those habits that you thought to be so good and so right let's see how difficult it becomes hello y'all don't hear me do you amen Hebrews 10 36 let's go to 35th verse cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God ye might receive the promise forget a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry I really believe that everybody in this in this place will truly have the full baptism of the Holy Ghost if you listen to your pastor but nobody want to listen you know why because you're set in your own ways and your own Traditions I don't have to go there why do God have me preaching it there do it sound like I'm fussing somewhat I am don't mean to be but my point is this the time of the coming of the Lord is so late and I can see the stragglers unbelief is written over everybody's face I can see when I say things that don't you don't you don't agree with and you reasoning in your mind I got a quote for you but my point is this if I'm the true man of God here and we going to go forward you got to listen come on it ain't me it's God in Me I can't take you nowhere but I'm instructed by the grace of God to say the things I say and do what I do why amen because amen it'll it'll take you in brother said that Pastor is ordained to see you through is that the message absolutely so I'm working hard and I think to myself I I was just thinking I said Lord I've offered that invitation so many times anybody who really want the Holy Ghost and want to come and pray through I come and pray with you I haven't got one person yet other than my wife I'm not asking anymore and you want God bad enough want some help I'm there to be your nurse cuz some people believe because of so many intellectual people somebody said to me the other day maybe I shouldn't say it but listen God didn't send me L God sent me Malachi and I can hear what Malachi 4 is saying CU that's Christ and Christ in that man I know the voice hello somebody oh y'all don't hear what I'm saying God didn't send me any bis or any of those people no sir y'all know what I'm saying I'm trying to tell you something listen if I know what I'm working with let me put it this way if he knows this B knows knew so much about the Holy Ghost why when the majority of the people the people that came to my church from his church after the split didn't even had years under that Ministry and never had it that's all I'm saying maybe they weren't listening either Hebrews 10 you know why why I'm ministering this because I want to go forward I want to be on one Accord y'all hear what I'm saying I want this little flock to be on one Accord it's such a shame we don't have as much I know some people may be still on vacation and whatever the case may be but we find out that it ain't going to do you no good to be ritualistically coming to church and not applying the word that's being preached it ain't going to happen it don't work that way now let me move on by the grace of God Hebrews 10:36 says for ye have need a patient that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tar now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back into predition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul and I was thinking I said oh my I said it's amazing how we come with our own ideas I done heard so many people say well you know brother bam said you know we shouldn't wear mustaches because you know the angel of the Lord when he came to brother Bram didn't have a mustache so what do you think that got rais us in heaven you know if that be a sin when you go camping you don't have those tools to are you sinning then I heard somebody say don't you know I'm going tell you something when I was an evangelist there was a man who wouldn't even let me preach cuz I wore a mustache nowhere in the word then I heard somebody say brother brand said amen that you shouldn't cut your mustache because there's a vein up there and if you cut it you can bleed to death some kind of stuff but it's so many things that people say he said and you can't even find it hello I do know one thing he said kick the TV out and I think to myself I said Lord I mean come on folks how many years you had that television interview I don't know who all got them but let me put it this way far as I know of the way the holy the Holy Spirit spoke to me there's so many people in here who got them and don't think that they're hindering the services oh God help me kick it out suffer the pain of loss y you don't have to I'm I'm preaching the word and you can take it or leave it but my point is this amen if if that's a a a garment you know we can look at garments we can look at everything people wear and then we'll have a box right there that you think is so innocent when it's not and don't get me wrong the the the the the the Internet is just as bad or worse and if you don't have the Holy Ghost you going you going to go places where you shouldn't go and if that be the case you don't need the Internet hello somebody you'll be surprised that the people in this message struggling from pornography but they don't want to get to the altar they're too proud to Humble themselves oh come on you need the Holy Ghost now I'm saying this now because it's true it's true people don't want to labor anymore and they said well you don't have to do that well brother brandham said it let me put it way let me say it like this you go listen to your despiration message and your token message go listen and see what he say about it and then we'll see amen that it's going to take a desperation you listen it's the truth let me put it this way if I got shot in the arm with a bullet amen and that bullet now is enlarged in my arm and it's causing me a lot of pain and the doctor said can I take it out oh no I don't want you to take it out but isn't it causing you pain yes causes me pain why won't you don't you understand eventually that same bullet can cause blood poisoning and everything else infection why because is in you and it's not supposed to be there so is the television I'm just telling you just the way he told me to say it now we look at these things and you say well you know and and and I know how people struggle some of these movies you know look so innocent you know I I'm talking about sanctification people this message taught us how to be Sanctified now you can't get the Holy Ghost without being Sanctified that's just all to it now you said what do you mean the same blood of Jesus Christ that saved you it's the same blood of Jesus Christ that can sanctify you but God ain't going to push you he is not going to override your will come on somebody God will not override your will are there any believers in here that's all I'm saying God is not going to override your will God wants you to do something about it and if there's anything that's holding you that means there's devils in your life there has demons that has has has control over you your greatest confence should be in the Holy Ghost not in Hollywood I'm trying to tell us something why am I saying this Israel had a chance of being totally delivered just like Rahab now think about it now Israel comes over and we find Moses taking them over through the Red Sea and they look behind all their enemies are dead there's nobody to say I used to know what you used to be there was nobody to say I saw you and I know the kind of you're evil I saw no there was nobody there to say there was nobody who heard you cursing and drinking and smoking and doping and there was nobody everything was dead everything died there was no Witnesses and that's what dying to Christ do does it brings you to a place where there's no more witnesses left Paul said the things I used to do I don't do no more it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me come on but what happened to Israel God comes and justifies them in the Red Sea baptize them under Moses bring him into the Wilderness to be Sanctified see what I'm saying God can't sanctify you as long as as long as you murmuring and complain see every time God tried to get the Devils away from them they wanted to hold on to the Devils you see what I'm saying every move God made they were complaining because they did not like the way he was leading them ain't that right a't that the way it works amen it's it's there on the job is everywhere people always complain about leadership but you know what you don't know what it's like until you get there yourself they will always fine fault in leadership but understand these leaderships these positions have been you have been placed under these leadership for what character building whether you like it or not God put you there my point is this they had the opportunity but what happened the Bible said they began to think about what it was like in Egypt isin't that the way the devil come God brings you all the way up Amen to a place in your life life and then he get you to a rough spot and start make he'll make you reminisce of what you on the things you thought were so good in Egypt it never was good in Egypt but the devil will make you think it was good and when he began to make them think it was good they started screaming out to Moses what did you do you CA call us out here to to die oh no the message people listen we don't have these big great churches we can't have have all these big uh conventions and all of the things that everybody else is doing we don't know how to do that we're not ordained to do that we were called for one purpose and that is to make yourself ready for a Rapture want to put it this way make yourself for a wedding brother Brandon preached a message total deliverance and that's what God is requiring from all of us and if we don't get enough we don't get desperate enough we'll be left behind and this same message right here will be playing in your ear you know brother B said it he said your own soul will preach against you your own soul let me read this thing let me read this coming from the spoken word is Original Seed he said I'm told that if we could pick up an instrument that catch it that a man's voice my voice that I speak today uh 10,000 years from now you could still be picked it could still be picked up in in the air like dropping a petal in the middle of a pond and the teeny little waves after they fail to be seen by the eyes continue on till it hits the bank and the air waves our voice continually to water around and around the world therefore then our voice what we say will be our judgment Our Testimony will rise up against us our own voice voices will echo in our own ears at the Judgment bar of God when his great instruments catches every voice that's been spoke every word that's been muttered Now understand this we didn't know it but the prophet God comes along and tells us that our what we think our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words so even your thoughts will be caught oh yes Lucifer you said in your heart right Jesus at Simon's house amen discern his thoughts he didn't speak it with his lips but the same God spoke it out why because he heard him right now no matter what I preach every thought you're thinking is being recorded whether you receiving it or whether you rejecting it it ain't between me and you it's between you and God and now there's only one way to stop that voice that's wrong that's repent you say and and I I just got to say it like this because a lot of time people don't think ministers affect you but they do affect you they affect your way of thinking they affect your way of worship that affects all these things and and let me say like this I had a brother right there when I went to Brother Samuel uh Fields there his own son 20 something years old 30 something years old left the message denied it but because he's been listening to PCF another brother amen all the way from England his Pastor was a his daddy was a pastor the same thing what is it they didn't know that thing was grabbing them they didn't know at the time there was a a hook of unbelief riding in their hearts and then when the opportunity came it happened right so that's why I say you got to be really really careful right listen and now there's only one way to step that uh stop that voice that's wrong that's repent y'all hear what I'm saying the only way to stop that voice all that negativity thing that we've been uttering and thinking and all of these things he said the only way to get rid of that God is the only way could do it and he said that is to repent right repent God Alone can stop it if it doesn't it'll go on and meet up with with you in the eternity therefore God being perfect and his voice Eternal his own voice will have to catch up with it therefore he must be perfect in every decision for when he once says something it has to go all the way and come back to the Judgment in other words God's Own word will be caught up with him everything Jesus Christ said will come up with him and that word will judge every one of us you say the bride ain't being judged she won't be come at the Judgment that's because judgment now is at the house of God you say oh brother books you be preaching trying to get us all emot emotional I wish I could I really wish I could but you know what it won't work before God because everything is willfully will you must will you must will it must be a will in you right listen what he say says it wasn't so from the beginning John Wesley he would turn over in his grave tonight if he know the Methodist Church getting formed and back to the uh to the tradition of men instead of staying with that word and you Baptist you need to hit a sawdust Trail too John Smith prayed until this all night and wept for sins over the people till his wife had to lead him around to the table of them to the table of the of the the morning to give him something to eat and feed him with a spoon anybody ever been there you done prayed all night till your eyes are swollen and matted together you can't even find your way through the through the room this is a this is this is a Baptist man who did this John Wesley excuse me John Smith you Methodist women wearing shorts and smoking cigarettes carrying on oh John Smith that great Methodist when he come preached a short sermon for four hours and you can't listen to a 20 minute when he was 80 years old and said it Grieves my heart to see even the Methodist sisters wearing rings on their fingers what about shorts now smoking cigarettes shame on you hello and you Pentecostals are getting as bad come up out of it don't be a grafted Vine go back to the original uh uh beginning and receive the Holy Ghost like they did on the day of Pentecost amen don't let the bishop get a hold of you let Christ get a hold of you I'm glad God uh I'm glad God got a hold of me before the church did he said I've been an Infidel see my point is this amen what has happened we have allowed traditional message stuff to get a hold of us come on somebody you don't have to say Amen it's true it's so true I mean you know we're so afraid to go over 45 minutes of of praying of worship or whatever the case may be I mean we're so afraid that we we can't shout and dance too much because that's going to be the world I don't know what you're talking about my Prophet told me that Satan got the dance from the church we we danced before he even thought about it huh yeah yeah they done perverted it but the real dancing comes from the true Sons and Daughters of God where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy Hallelujah before the foundation of the world we were dancing hallelujah oh and it's true listen now I I'm saying these things because I really believe this is what where God got me here tonight first Peter please first Peter we're we're late we're late in the evening look what's happening anybody you know anything was happening to Israel come on somebody it this thing is wrapping up it is you know did y'all know Israel built a wall around it there's a wall huh and that wall has been built for protection I want you to realize amen if that be the case what was the first thing that that God that they built before they could build the temple come down from that wall huh oh come on somebody but they built a wall and and now the devil amen through the uh I think it's syrians or whoever it is they they over there now they're shooting they they couldn't they Israel got themselves so fortified to the first few bombs that came at them they were they would they were dismissed they were caught but then they they found little loopholes and I say okay if they found loopholes there's got to be a spy somewhere H there's got to be a samb ballot somewhere y'all hear what I'm saying amen but you look at these things you say well brother listen I'm going to tell you something this Pope he's moving in this into the he want Jerusalem so bad he's going to get it you know this treaty is coming now if God is moving that fast in Israel what's happening to you well I know a Revival coming people of God the kingdom of God the Bible said must be pressed into you can't just oh don't you realize if it was hard for you yesterday what is going to be for you today the day before a day after brother said every day every day it gets harder way in the 60s he said if you don't believe it he said it's going to get harder to receive the holy ghost in the 60s what about now it's hard why because people are busy they don't they say they love God they want to make a Rapture but they don't want to get on their knees they don't have time to pray we got time for everything but prayer why cuz we sensual we want to we want to feel it oh I got to feel it you might feel it but you need to let God know I'm here and I need you Lord Brother said until you get desperate like that old man said Lord he said you going to give me the holy ghost or when you come back by here you going to find find a pile of bones yeah but but so many of we don't want to leave your oh I'm going to be left behind come back for me tomorrow y'all understand me I don't think y'all understand me I'm saying when it come to prayer when God gets a hold of you in this place I don't care if who got to go you stay here till it's done y'all hear what I'm saying I've been that way I've been in prayers it's been so wonderful amen and everybody go then the devil said well you might as well get up too no no more no more no more my point is amen when God is in the building I'm going to stay there stay there like Jacob did I wrestle with the angel till I'm blessed I know I'm telling you I'm trying to tell you it's later than what you think 1 Peter 2 I'm sorry four first Peter 4 1 Peter 4 69 n you know why I I I put this way folks if a child has to be born under a certain condition or egg has to be hatched under a certain heat you think it's in here now do you really think the atmosphere is charged up enough for somebody to get the Holy Ghost if they desired it absolutely not huh and that's the only way a real birth can come that's one thing I could say people well the Pentecostal didn't get the Holy Ghost yes they did they just didn't get it all to the soul because they didn't have the word to take it there many of them got it in their Spirit but they did not have the word to take them to the Holy Holy that's what made this message different it took you out of the living room into the bedroom in the Pentecostal realm you just in the living room kitchen however you want to put it but my point is they got it like Rebecca got the gifts but they didn't get the giver who is Isaac and they weren't willing and ready to ride that humpback camel you know what a humpback camel you go up and down up and down that's how it is in prayer but I'm going to tell you something it'll show take you there if you ride it long enough huh huh you ride it long enough it'll take you right to Isaac 1 Peter 4 ah my heart goes out first Peter 46 you got it for this call was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead they got it right yeah well that's a good one though let's keep going amen wherein they think it's strange that you run not with them to the same excess of Riot speaking evil of you who should give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be be ye therefore sober and watch where unto prayer of All Above All Things Have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sin is that right because when the atmosphere is not charge people when you're not bubbling over when you know that atmosphere let me tell you something I don't care what your problems are if a person you yourself comeing this church and the serums are really going and the power of God is in the building you it lights you up it just lights you up why that atmosphere has been created but it ain't all the song Leader's fault either y'all hear what I'm saying now it is my point is this amen the time is at hand the Bible say that you're a chosen generation you're a royal priesthood is that all right amen so what happened we're looking at time I'm just saying are there any believers we say we Believers but brother B said if you can't live it you're not believing it you say you believe it but because but you're not living it huh and if you're not living it you're not a Believer potentially you are come on somebody no this is not a Hallelujah message but I tell you what if you can listen and hear the spirit what the spirit say to the church you'll be blessed in it we can't hardly do trials oh Lord we just we just let the devil beat us all up in Trials don't we and the Bible tells us amen the First Peter 1 and7 the tri the trial of your faith being more precious than gold that's perishes though it be tried with fire might be found to praise and honor and Glory at the peing of Jesus Christ you got to suffer and the thing about it is you don't say what the Lord done curse me no no no no the Bible said he's blessing you you're going through these trials to be blessed not curse and we need to learn how to praise God in all time now I know sometime it's difficult but I believe the truth greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world think about it we want the Holy Ghost listen St John 6:49 and I'm going to be long tonight your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead why why they dead because the Bible tells us According to Hebrew four I believe it is they wouldn't mix the things they heard with faith they heard it all they heard it right but they wouldn't put the faith out there they wouldn't they wouldn't jump out of the boat and says Lord I'm coming right come he says Peter got out of the boat and he started walking he took the risk and that's what faith does faith would take risk all the time because first of all Faith don't even look at the risk Faith just jumps right into it and moves with it now the Bible said he that come to God must first believe that he is what God and that he's a reward of them that D diligently seek him that's right you got to believe this word Is God When You Believe the word is God you know where you place it not here not here not even here this is not the aim I'm working with you placeing here above all things y'all understanding now I'm working with this and I'm working with principalities and power you understand me he is the head of the church that's what I'm working with he is the head above all things he is the head of the church so if he's the head of the church that means he's Above This above your head right so my point is when God becomes the word right what if I say that's supposing I'm I'm God and I you know what I mean but let's just say I give you an order stand right here till I come back now didn't God do that one time before he told Saul you be stay right here till I get back I'm coming now I'm coming but don't you do nothing I'll be right back Saul within his reason and said well I know he going to take a while so I'll just move on out of here and do it myself and that's where we mess up all he had to do is wait for Samuel Samuel was going to do the sacrifice he never would have lost his kingdom he never would have had to die all history would have been changed only if he had only been obedient what if God would have told those disciples you te there into Jerusalem till I come till you be endued with power brother man said they tried it for those 10 days is that him is this him that's you know they wanted to know no that ain't him you know they but they stayed there they weren't running in and out of the church like a lot of people do here religious Le people don't even have to go to the restroom and they walk out there are some of us who have to but there's some of us who don't y'all hear what I'm saying it is what it is but people don't understand the Holy Ghost is so sensitive to those things affect the move of God in this church I've ask people to give me nominations for deacons I ain't seen nothing yet except for one person now y'all I I'll be honest with you people of God God has an order he has a stru it ain't about what you think about it is what God is leading me to do but we can't find nobody we can't find the people say okay let's get behind the pastor let's move on we won't move until people submit not to me to God if they can trust a Ministry I heard somebody say the other day went is so true you know and I don't think we you know we we we we we've dealt with tight skirts we dealt with splits we've dealt with high heels we dealt with we we you know I don't think nobody cutting hairir but cutting hair but you know what all the message people are still doing it and they say they're Believers what are you you know why I'm working with this because I'm trying to pinpoint you as an individual I'm saying all these things because I want you to think about are you truly a Believer are you truly a believer of this message because that's the only way you gonna get out of here is to be a really true a true true true believer amen second Peter please the last scripture even Jesus said this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever and this is what scares me because everybody can see what God did to Israel but they don't believe it's happening to them they don't even believe it they they can't even see they eat mana and they're not living huh because of unbelief you you can eat all the Mana you want you can eat all the word you want but you're not living because of your it can't live because of unbelief it Faith must be applied Amen brother Brooks that's the best service I've heard you preach in a long time that felt good to me I might have to do that more often but here it is second Peter the thir chapter people my point is this I wouldn't preach this message tonight if I didn't care I'm not trying to get in your business huh that's between you and God but I have to do his business I'm called to do his business and I'm doing his business if you got a problem you have to talk it over with him y'all hear what I'm saying don't go home that brother Brook said did the word say it did brother bandam say the things I'm saying okay so if if that be true then what God is trying to do for you take you to the next level you cannot be spiritual being part of the world brother bam said God would judge us for doing those things and even having pleasure of with those who do it so you don't even have to do it but when you home or in the street or whever you doing and you having pleasure with the world God hate that you could be doing it just in your mind god holds you guilty for it second Peter 3 you know what I heard the other day when I was down there they say scientifically they have proven that when you look at television it causes dark spots in your brain and then it also causes your brain to shrink is a new scientific discovery I said no wonder people insane no wonder people are going crazy cuz everybody watches TV and you're sinful if you don't go look it up that's what I heard last week I'm like wow that sounds about right second Peter 3 3-9 knowing that the first let me ask you a question since y'all let me ask you whether it make no difference it's like this brother R said if you see a woman and you know that first look you turn like I heard a brother say you know what the problem is y'all know it's just only one look but you look a long time and that's just as bad that's just as bad you got to make a your mind now I'm on turn you done already did what you're supposed to do second Peter 33:9 knowing this first that there should come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promises of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of cre of the creation Now ain't that the same kind of attitude that they took that when Moses was up on the mountain 40 days where is Moses he been up there 40 days he probably dead now right the same kind of attitude and look what's happening Among Us close friend of mine died either today or yesterday I just got the news today and his Pastor was one of the p that deny the father my precious brother was right there when he was trying to explain to me that brother Brandon wasn't Elijah my day and now he's gone and cross the cabin I I don't know where he's at all I could think about today was Lord God I don't know what what was in his heart but I surely hope at some point in time God calls him to repent if there was a place to repent a friend of mine called me the other day he said was 17 18 years old just graduated from high school a real Christian boy in a denominational church and I believe God still works with me but his mama said but boy I got you going to college he said I ain't going to college mama I'm going home she said home she she said yeah God don't show me I'm going to heaven he coming for me I'm not going I'm not going to college and here this boy was trying to tell his mom I think he dropped dead in church just dead boom there was no the the the the the the the they did the autopsy said no hard failure they just he just died of natural causes boom his hard just stopped but he had been telling them for weeks that God was going to take him home and nobody believed him nobody believed him and then all of a sudden he just all his mama could do was cry and say but my Lord my good child why take my good child you know just like brother randam said he said these people disappearing he said how do you know the Rapture is not taking place now you ever heard him saying we don't know how God is going to do it he said but all these people disappearing how do you know the Rapture is not taking place now people don't even know where they are let me hurry this is my last scripture and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation but this call they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were made were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perish you know how you overcome ah I don't care if it's one thing at a time you got to knock on God's door until he gets right you got to knock on God I mean really cry out because every one of us has to be a to it must be a total Deliverance people you can't have the world in you and God at the same time brother B said it doesn't exist a speck of the world he said the love of God is not in you but the devil will make you think he is whereby the world that was was was uh being overflowed with water perish but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men now he ain't just saying sat he's saying ungodly men that were once were Godly are supposed to be Godly were ungodly right the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so you see I'm I'm working here tonight and I I want to read one more quote before I let you go you know I don't want to suffer Lord we don't want to suffer Lord I mean why are we going through all of these things and I always tell the people I say you going through it because you asked for it you asked for it Lord I want to be just like you right I want to be just like you and I don't it's like this people of God when it comes down to God to Moses you think about it millions millions millions milons of people died and only two out of that because they saw beyond the Flesh of mes and they saw God did Moses make mistakes yes but they heard and had the ability to hear God coming from beond flesh and it comes right back down to the very simple fact when Jesus said my sheep Hearth my voice and the Strang that they will not you can say all you want to but I say it like this I haven't even considering myself basically just stopping the internet service that we have because you know what I don't want to confuse nobody I didn't say I would I said I've been considering because I don't want nobody comparing me with their Pastor I don't give it out pretty much anywhere until I unless it's somebody I know who don't have service but y'all understand me or somebody that really needed y' getting quiet on that I wasn't commissioned to do that we weren't I just put it this way it comes by real preaching only believe oh I'm so glad tonight I'm so glad tonight to know that there's a circumcision of the heart that God will cut away all the world and all the tradition of men and everything else and we can see Jesus and see him standing there in a pill of fire going before performing The Works and doing exactly what God Said would do and bring a church filled with the Holy Ghost and doing the works that he said I'm glad tonight I the happiest person in this world because of it because he promised it and won't it be a sad thing if we get just like I tell people I said Being Born Again is one thing and coming to Perfection is another you heard the messages preached on adoption y'all think God kidding with it God means exactly what he says and he says what he means and adoption amen comes to the place brother Brandon described it when when a Son of God come to the place he's adopted he tells Heaven hear ye him and I tell you what I say it like this how on Earth you going to grow up to be a perfect Son of God if when if the birth is not there first Amy say it like this brother bandam said it like this I was listen to the message I think it's yesterday uh Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever he said there have been no other time or no other age where the sons of God can be made Manifest this is the age of the manifestations of the sons of God this is the age that where the whole creation have been groaning to see and you and I we say we're true Sons and Daughters of God then we ought to be about our father's business what do you mean I don't say it like this not on your knees growing standing laying in the presence of the son where Jesus Christ the word becomes your main priority nothing else some of us will make it and some of us won't some of us will take it seriously and some of us won't some of us will be began to ask God for desperation Lord bring desper Les I perish Lord help me help me help me help me this is a desperate time because they're coming a time you'll call on him but he won't answer seek me while I may be found call upon me while I'm near that's his word oh do you get tired ask a pregnant woman do you get tired when you're in labor I think she's say yeah do you just give up maybe in my mind at times but it won't do no good cuz there's a pull there's something going on in me that makes that drives me anyhow see that's the way it's supposed to be you're supposed to be driven something in you supposed to be pulling and driving you God I need more of you I can't be satisfied The Way I Am Lord I can't stand this if I die now what's going to happen to me when brother said the only thing he's coming from is character now I tell you what I never too much like that bracet what would Jesus do but sometime I think about it if you got the Holy Ghost he'll tell you what he'll do right and I think about it I say you think about all the things you do and question yourself would Jesus do and if your answers are no that means you got to get rid of it Hallelujah glory to God that felt good let's stand y'all know I Don't Preach like this it just something in me just you know I had I had such a powerful experience when I shut in before going on this trip and it ain't it's growing but it's a uh more of a seriousness something in me is causing me to be more serious ious about the things I believe it's a warning it's something that just I can't explain it but there's something here I don't know how to say it that wasn't before now only God will make manifest what it is and I believe with all my heart amen that God has taken me to another level and I don't know what all he's got in mind but I'm trying to pull I'm saying come go with me come follow me let's get up higher folks let's go on with god let's forget about the carnal things let's fight this devil like we really are in a war let's stop him from pushing us and bullying us around and doing all these things that he been doing for a long time and we just been laying down and letting them kick us any kind of way and then say God help me and God says why you greater as he I you got you got armor armor fight him yourself fight with what you got you know the thing about it it is who cares if you get tired you get tired but you keep going people that how can I say it for those people who are left behind or those who are now in the region of the Lost would I know they wish they would have prayed more I know they would have wished they would have given God more time think about it I know I know I know I know you think about uh uh any any anybody in their right mind this is an opportunity we don't have the persecution on us yet it's coming we know that do we have a Believer here it's coming we don't even know how bad it's going to be it's coming if you realize amen even how the Muslims are taking over the country I don't even know how they fit in but the Bible said they'll be hated Ishmael will be hated in every nation and listen They're Taking Over America whether you believe it or not but I I guarantee you amen it's a treaty it's something that the pope has agreed with the with the with the Muslim people because they ain't up the same group they just like &m just got a different color right the same chocolate and everything else underneath murder us that's right brother so you and I better realize amen we're coming into a situation amen and and the only thing that's going to help us is that token life the only thing that's going to happen
