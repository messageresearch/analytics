[10:36] the grace of God God knows and
[10:38] understands
[10:39] all um when when we read the scripture
[10:43] and Paul is talking about Revelation
[10:45] made known mystery and and those kind of
[10:48] things of course we like to hear those
[10:49] words or that mystery um but Mysteries
[10:54] when is revealed to you it it it it how
[10:57] can I say it it's like like the little
[10:59] boy
[11:00] uh looking in the mirror it identifies
[11:03] you it makes you know what you look like
[11:05] and your image um and and this is what
[11:08] the Bible does uh we uh who are the
[11:12] children of God and this is what brother
[11:13] random said he said that God wanted a
[11:17] family amen uh prior to that we didn't
[11:20] know that and you know I don't know
[11:22] about you but being in the denomination
[11:24] of churches uh you know it was always I
[11:27] hope I'm I'm I'm hoping
[11:29] that God will save me I didn't know it
[11:32] was a an
[11:34] assurance amen that God has assured us
[11:37] yes sir that we are saved and this is
[11:39] what Paul is doing here in the scripture
[11:42] he's not only identifying but opening it
[11:45] up that we are have and always been a
[11:49] mystery of God and his connection with
[11:51] the
[11:53] Gentiles but in reality it was always in
[11:56] the word I mean you take uh Ruth
[11:59] and Boaz you know what I mean you you
[12:02] you you go throughout all of the uhhh
[12:05] scriptures and you find these Gentile
[12:08] women which is represents the Gentile
[12:10] church or the Gentile bride and and how
[12:13] God grafted them in I guess one of the
[12:16] things that really
[12:18] um amazes me is when God goes to Jericho
[12:23] and he finds a prostitute amen and and
[12:26] she literally
[12:27] becomes an heir one thing about the wife
[12:31] which is beautiful is because once she
[12:35] is the consummation occurs she's she no
[12:39] longer has her own
[12:41] identity she and the man becomes one and
[12:44] he and she loses her name and takes on
[12:49] his and and that's what God is trying to
[12:52] tell us all along amen that we we loses
[12:56] our identity as a gentile people we're
[12:59] no longer Gentile we become as Jewish as
[13:03] God was am or God is now we understand
[13:07] that God is a different kind of Jew
[13:10] because his judism did not come by
[13:13] sexual activity amen he was appointed or
[13:18] anointed or however you want to say it
[13:20] uh just like uh God appointed SE uh the
[13:24] Bible said when God brought forth self
[13:27] then men began to call on the name of
[13:29] the Lord Jesus Christ was an appointed
[13:32] ordained seed of God and guess what the
[13:35] mystery of the whole thing is that in
[13:38] his seed you were there amen now we
[13:41] talking about a mystery because for how
[13:45] many years even when it came to the
[13:47] Jewish people God chose them to be the
[13:50] chosen one chosen people but instead of
[13:53] being clothed in humility they were
[13:55] clothed in Pride and the people that
[13:58] they were to be lights uh
[14:01] unto uh actually became their enemy uh
[14:05] really GLE that's why you get proales
[14:08] because people began to see God Among
[14:11] the Jews and then they join in with the
[14:14] Jews and became a Jew by ritual but here
[14:18] you become a Jew if you want to say it
[14:20] like this by birth amen uh we are the
[14:24] spiritual Israel right so anyway let's
[14:28] move on he said but which in other Ages
[14:31] was not made known Unto the Sons of men
[14:34] as it is now revealed unto unto His Holy
[14:37] Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that
[14:40] what the Gentiles should be fellow Hees
[14:43] I love that and of the same body and
[14:47] partakers of his promise in Christ by
[14:50] the gospel amen think about people that
[14:54] had no uh real identity we were called
[14:57] dogs even by Jes Jesus and and that was
[15:00] our nature that's what we did uh but
[15:04] God by his
[15:07] grace grafted Us
[15:09] in and now we are a part of him in so
[15:14] much so we are called the brid tree
[15:17] that's amen so we must know by the grace
[15:20] of God that what we're now working with
[15:22] and I'm going to read a few things
[15:23] quickly but I want you to understand
[15:26] we're not talking about fundamental
[15:28] Church is that's right the Church of God
[15:31] is not a fundamental Church it has some
[15:35] fundamentals but it is a spirit fill
[15:38] church amen that's what distinguish you
[15:41] that's what distinguish me from all
[15:44] other things uh God uh uh bringing us
[15:48] into his body by one spirit amen and and
[15:51] Paul is
[15:52] exemp how can I say it um pushing this
[15:57] in the sense that you know if you take
[16:00] his writings when it comes to
[16:01] Corinthians and I I'll come to that in
[16:03] just a moment but Paul says you know I
[16:06] fear lest you would be beguiled like Eve
[16:10] was he said listen I I I want to present
[16:14] unto you unto Christ you as a Chase
[16:18] virgin and the only way you can become
[16:21] that is that you stay with the word I
[16:24] was talking with brother Craig today and
[16:27] I told him I said now why have we made
[16:29] this message so
[16:31] complicated it shouldn't be I said to
[16:35] put it in a
[16:38] nutshell Eve
[16:41] disbelieved amen Eve
[16:44] disobeyed and in order to be
[16:47] restored you must
[16:49] believe and you must obey
[16:52] amen
[16:54] simple the word of
[16:56] God it goes right back wherever she fell
[17:00] we must come back to it amen but in a
[17:02] positive way but we make it so fantastic
[17:07] I guess is the word it shouldn't be that
[17:10] way but let me read it what what I tried
[17:13] to quote here second Corinthians please
[17:15] 2 Corinthians the 11th
[17:17] chapter uh
[17:22] 3-5 always remember
[17:26] Ephesians was a mature Church
[17:30] she was not like
[17:33] Corinthians amen Ephesians according to
[17:36] the prophet of God she had all the gifts
[17:40] every one of them she had
[17:42] two and she even had a prophet amen but
[17:45] it wasn't her day and her time for a
[17:49] Rapture that's right you understand me
[17:52] because Malachi four was the last
[17:54] prophet to show
[17:56] himself on the scene amen
[17:59] Paul was the first
[18:02] amen and William brandom the seventh
[18:05] right y y'all understand what I'm saying
[18:07] and we understand that seven is
[18:09] completion so what what the prophet had
[18:13] to do or wasn't that he did it but God
[18:16] through through Visions through
[18:19] Revelation and things like that he had
[18:21] to show him the things in which Paul
[18:24] preached amen see because everybody
[18:27] could read those things where Paul
[18:29] preach and still yet get a different
[18:31] Revelation but God had to give him the
[18:33] correct
[18:35] revelation of what was preached hundreds
[18:38] of years ago so that this day this
[18:42] church could have the pure word of God
[18:45] Amen without any mixture that's right
[18:48] because y'all remember mixture is the
[18:50] thing that caused the problem in the
[18:53] beginning here Paul says the third verse
[18:57] but I Fearless
[18:59] any lest by any means as the serpent
[19:03] beguiled Eve through his subti so your
[19:07] mind should be corrupted from the
[19:09] Simplicity that is in Christ and you
[19:12] know what he says so your mind amen
[19:15] because that's where the serpent went
[19:17] first he went to her mind before he
[19:20] could get her body he went to her mind
[19:23] that's right and before go the devil can
[19:25] get you to do anything wrong or negative
[19:28] he comes to to your mind and the moment
[19:31] you listen to him you've already fallen
[19:34] right is that right amen that's why
[19:37] Jesus said as a man thinketh in his
[19:39] heart amen that's right so is he
[19:45] right your mind your body and your soul
[19:48] are those three uh parts of you that you
[19:51] must fight to keep holy amen once you
[19:55] have achieved God in your soul
[20:00] it's
[20:01] wonderful but now your spirit has to be
[20:04] controlled Lord and your flesh had to
[20:07] has to be controlled Lord right you said
[20:10] what do we wait wait yes that's why the
[20:12] Bible said grieve not the Holy Ghost
[20:16] whereby you will seal to the day of your
[20:19] Redemption though you be perfect in your
[20:21] soul God wants to you to be perfect in
[20:24] your spirit as well as your flesh amen
[20:27] that's why Paul says you Must Die daily
[20:30] amen now here was Paul a man full of the
[20:32] Holy Ghost but he understood the nature
[20:34] of the spirit and he understood the
[20:37] nature of the flesh yes it because you
[20:40] know what without the spirit and the
[20:41] flesh if we had just that perfect soul
[20:43] with the soul where the Holy Ghost is
[20:45] we'd be ready for a Rapture but God as
[20:49] he told Israel when it came to the
[20:52] Joshua conquer everything
[20:55] amen and that same Commission
[20:59] is given to us to conquer everything
[21:02] this is
[21:04] yours your body your soul your spirit is
[21:08] yours that's right God gave this to you
[21:12] it's not of the
[21:14] devil because even in the resurrection
[21:16] you're going to still look like
[21:19] you right but in a glorified way and
[21:24] Paul is saying to you it's given to you
[21:27] it it's not like you got a work for it
[21:29] you got to believe it and act upon
[21:33] it right for he listen but for if he
[21:38] that cometh preach another Jesus whom we
[21:42] have not preached that's that fourth
[21:44] verse or if you receive another Spirit
[21:48] which you have not received or another
[21:52] gospel which ye have not accepted ye
[21:55] might well bear with him I'm going say
[21:57] I'm going to read that one again for if
[22:00] he that cometh preaches another Jesus
[22:03] you mean there's another Jesus yes and
[22:06] are you aware that Joshua is the same
[22:09] word as Jesus amen right and brother
[22:12] bandam said there was no greater warrior
[22:14] in all times as great as Joshua am now
[22:18] he's not including Jesus but you know
[22:20] he's working with Joshua because Joshua
[22:23] is a type of Jesus right because this is
[22:27] what the prophet of God said
[22:29] and I'm kind of jumping uh in in in in
[22:31] in my in my study but he said and I'll
[22:33] read it to you in just a moment he said
[22:35] what happened to that Pillar of Fire
[22:38] that was with Moses he said that Pillar
[22:41] of Fire that was with Moses turned into
[22:44] a man
[22:46] amen yes sir and that man was that angel
[22:49] of the Lord and and when that angel of
[22:52] the Lord when Joshua saw that angel with
[22:54] the sword drawn he said who side are you
[22:57] going to be on right understand Joshua's
[23:01] mentality yes he had an invincible mind
[23:05] Amen in other words nothing can conquer
[23:07] me because I am on the Lord's Side amen
[23:11] or the Lord is on my side and this is
[23:13] what he asked that angel come on
[23:15] somebody he said who are
[23:18] you whose side are you on right and then
[23:22] when the angel said I am the what
[23:24] Captain amen of the Lord's host now I
[23:28] want you to understand we've got the
[23:31] same Captain that's right in Revelation
[23:33] 10 I think it's the mighty angel that
[23:35] came down it's the same Angel amen it's
[23:39] God himself that's right he's here to
[23:44] make sure we conquer everything of the
[23:47] soul of the body and the spirit
[23:52] amen how you going to conquer your
[23:56] flesh your flesh has to die that's right
[23:59] y'all heard what I said the other night
[24:01] think about some of the things that you
[24:02] have been uh uh o you've
[24:06] overcome there is no
[24:08] temptation
[24:10] none that's what dead mean amen and God
[24:14] want us to bring this flesh under
[24:16] control where it's so
[24:18] dead no temptation that's what he said
[24:22] brother the pro brandom said the devil
[24:23] won't won't know what to do with you
[24:26] amen you'll be so yielded to the Holy
[24:29] Spirit the devil try every trick he
[24:31] possibly can with you and will not
[24:34] succeed amen because you have been you
[24:38] have allowed
[24:39] Joshua to conquer the land
[24:42] amen that's what I
[24:45] believe Hallelujah now now he says
[24:51] listen another gospel that means just a
[24:54] little bit of twist can bring death to
[24:57] you
[24:59] just a little
[25:00] bit and and I'm going tell you what I I
[25:03] I see a lot of people are not conscious
[25:05] of
[25:06] it but I I'm I'm going re reate this so
[25:11] you can
[25:12] understand we don't have time no sir
[25:17] for structural things how can I say it
[25:24] fundamentals we need God Amen we need
[25:27] the holy GH ghost we need God and and
[25:30] and the thing about it is we can have it
[25:32] all lined up in a row like like Cain did
[25:36] he was fundamental and brother BR said
[25:38] he worshiped God Amen but it wasn't what
[25:41] God required he required blood amen and
[25:45] no matter how we love this message quote
[25:49] this message think you know this message
[25:52] it will never the only thing that gives
[25:54] you power or authority is the blood of
[25:56] Jesus Christ that's right
[26:01] proven proven by the sons of
[26:05] ska when I preach the Jesus Paul
[26:09] preach you I preach the Jesus brother
[26:12] Brandon preach what you better know him
[26:15] amen that's right and he must know you
[26:19] cuz those demons know when you got it
[26:21] and when you
[26:23] don't right amen so we know we know we
[26:28] we
[26:28] listen I'm coming to this because I want
[26:31] this Ephesian is really and I can't say
[26:33] it all in just a little while but this
[26:35] Ephesian is exciting me you know why
[26:38] because I read Joshua
[26:40] amen and then I heard the message about
[26:43] on Joshua brother Ram says and he goes
[26:46] on to say that remember Jericho was shut
[26:51] up they were
[26:53] afraid so understand this the demons of
[26:58] this age they are afraid of you that's
[27:03] truth right there but we we we we afraid
[27:06] of them a lot of them we are no no no no
[27:09] they are afraid of us because they see
[27:13] the transformation that God has done in
[27:16] your life amen they can recognize like
[27:20] people amen that's and the word is gone
[27:23] out amen right don't even think those
[27:27] demons done for what brother Bram the
[27:29] Lord did through brother brandham amen
[27:31] that's right right in other words we saw
[27:34] what God did over in Egypt amen we saw
[27:38] what God did and now this ministry is
[27:41] greater Amen in the sense you got more
[27:44] than one man you got a body
[27:47] amen see the devil's
[27:50] scared the world is scared you don't
[27:53] believe me do you let me say it like
[27:55] this that's why all of the Council of
[27:57] church churches and everything the
[27:59] political realm the social realm
[28:01] everybody is coming to do what trying to
[28:04] destroy the bride what do you think this
[28:06] thing in in Israel happening what do you
[28:08] think that is amen they are afraid how
[28:12] can so many countries be afraid of a
[28:15] little country because they see God Amen
[28:19] and their inspiration is from the devil
[28:23] amen we can't be afraid no no no no no
[28:28] we got to be like
[28:31] Joshua Hallelujah Revelations 10 please
[28:34] the demon the demons
[28:36] trembles at the name of
[28:39] Jesus that's why the devil don't want us
[28:41] to get that Holy Ghost you get the Holy
[28:42] Ghost you got Jesus that's right
[28:46] Hallelujah glory to
[28:50] God excuse
[28:52] me yeah you got it Revelations 10
[28:56] 1-7 and I saw another Mighty Angel any
[29:00] questions any
[29:02] thoughts okay we'll move on Revelations
[29:05] 10 1-7 and I saw another Mighty Angel
[29:09] come down from heaven clothed with a
[29:11] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[29:15] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[29:18] his feet as pillars of fire and and he
[29:21] had in his hand a little book open and
[29:24] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[29:28] and his left foot on the earth now here
[29:30] Paul talks about Mysteries and now here
[29:33] the scripture talks about Mysteries but
[29:35] now this book that once was sealed is
[29:39] now open amen and so therefore there's
[29:43] Mysteries coming forth and
[29:45] understandings that are coming forth to
[29:47] what not the Jew not at this present
[29:50] time but to the Gentile amen because
[29:53] what God is doing now and this is what I
[29:56] believe the Lord said to me not long ago
[29:58] go he said this is the hour of
[30:01] selection Lord you know everybody oh I'm
[30:04] bride I'm bride but right now this is
[30:06] the hour of selection amen is that right
[30:09] because everybody all the beautiful
[30:12] girls uh uh came before King aser all of
[30:16] the ones they got it from every
[30:19] Providence but there was one
[30:21] Esther and she was
[30:24] selected and right now this is what God
[30:27] is doing many call for few are
[30:29] chosen so keep that heart in in your
[30:32] mind amen and and and as we as our
[30:35] brother rich brought that scripture out
[30:36] I think it's Mark Mark 6:21 or something
[30:40] like that pray that God would count to
[30:43] worthy Amen to escape the wrath that is
[30:47] to come that's right it's coming amen
[30:51] right right so anyway let's move on and
[30:54] he cried with a loud voice as when a
[30:57] line and Roar and when he had cried even
[31:01] I mean seven Thunders uttered their
[31:03] voices you know people still still
[31:05] afraid of when you say seven Thunders
[31:07] they like wow where is he going with
[31:09] that people of God it's the
[31:12] word why are people afraid of the
[31:16] word I don't understand that anyway and
[31:21] when the seven Thunders it doesn't
[31:22] matter what others have done with it God
[31:26] interprets his own word
[31:29] amen even brother brandham said when it
[31:31] came to the Seven Seals don't try to
[31:33] interpret it it will interpret
[31:38] itself but we hardhead men we want to
[31:42] always jump in there and make it
[31:44] something that is not or satisfy the
[31:47] people's itching ears and all of that
[31:49] good stuff but you know what happens to
[31:52] that right at the end of the day they
[31:55] end up building a golden calf that's
[31:57] right
[31:59] right men
[32:02] worshippers instead of worshiping
[32:05] God and when the seven Thunders had
[32:08] uttered their voices I was about to
[32:10] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[32:12] saying unto me seal up those things
[32:16] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[32:18] write them not and the angel which I saw
[32:22] stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted
[32:25] up his hand to heaven and swear by him
[32:28] that liveth forever and ever who created
[32:30] heaven and the things that there are
[32:33] therein are and the earth and the things
[32:35] that that therein are and the Sea and
[32:39] the things that the things that which
[32:41] are therein and that there should be
[32:46] time no longer listen but I love the but
[32:50] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[32:53] angel when he shall begin to sound right
[32:57] remember the the book was closed the
[32:58] book was and now he says but listen
[33:00] there's coming a day those Mysteries
[33:02] will
[33:04] sound right so here it is and brother
[33:06] bandam says listen at the at the at the
[33:09] beyond the curtain of time he said well
[33:11] Paul have to stand like I stood and and
[33:14] the voice says yes amen then brother BR
[33:17] says I'm you know in other words I'm
[33:20] happy to hear that and then the whole
[33:22] redeemed crew because brother said I
[33:26] preach exactly what Paul preached and
[33:29] the whole Cru is I'm resting on that in
[33:32] other words I'm in heaven because you
[33:35] what you preached amen amen true I'm
[33:39] resting on that y'all understand me it's
[33:42] not like I'm going to get there and rest
[33:44] no no no I'm resting I'm not in hell I'm
[33:48] not lost I'm in this place because of
[33:51] what you preached
[33:56] amen so we can we can truly Bank on what
[34:01] Paul is
[34:02] saying because Paul even set a standard
[34:06] he said if an angel come and preach
[34:08] anything other than what I preached let
[34:11] it be a curse amen hallelujah glory to
[34:15] God so this Ephesians and this Joshua
[34:19] you put them together and you understand
[34:22] what this is
[34:25] not heaven amen
[34:29] we have been
[34:30] ordained to fight amen and because you
[34:34] say oh I'm circum circumcised I was
[34:37] justified yes Sanctified yes but now
[34:42] that you receive the Holy Ghost the
[34:44] battle is on Amen and now what is it you
[34:49] follow the orders of Joshua right
[34:52] remember aen did not Joshua said kill
[34:56] everything don't bring nothing back we
[34:59] don't want we don't need none of that
[35:01] and and aen did just the opposite guess
[35:03] what he died so it's so important to
[35:09] follow the message or the word of the
[35:11] Lord through the prophet it it's it's
[35:14] always going to be Bible folks you got
[35:17] to bring it back to the Bible it's
[35:18] always in the Bible amen but people
[35:21] think it's something different only
[35:24] because you didn't you never caught the
[35:26] Revelation and you never took what
[35:28] brother Ram said back to the Bible amen
[35:30] but it's in there Jesus Christ the same
[35:33] yesterday today and forever Hallelujah
[35:35] is that right even they thought some of
[35:37] the things like the Thunders or whatever
[35:39] he you was that was on the back side of
[35:41] the book he couldn't add nothing brother
[35:44] said one day you'll find out where it is
[35:47] written amen it's in there how long was
[35:50] Acts 238 in the
[35:53] Bible and Through the Dark Ages they
[35:56] lost it right amen right read it and
[35:59] read right over it but one day God
[36:02] required it cuz he was
[36:05] restoring so that's how God works now
[36:09] who is he building now he's not building
[36:12] a
[36:13] denomination matter of fact he's a he's
[36:15] gone out from them they they think
[36:18] they're alive but the Bible said a woman
[36:21] that lives in pleasure is already dead
[36:25] amen he's got a People that he's
[36:27] building and you you and me we are that
[36:32] people that Ephesians is telling us
[36:35] listen you are the mystery made known
[36:39] Hallelujah you're the manifested of the
[36:41] manifested word you're the one that God
[36:44] has hidden all these years you Gentiles
[36:48] God has chosen you to be bride and
[36:51] understand that your beginning was not
[36:53] in time it was before time amen Paul is
[36:57] laying it on but you see you have to be
[37:00] spiritual understanding
[37:03] amen
[37:04] because as the prophet said God couldn't
[37:07] give this meat to the Corinthians they
[37:09] were too carnal they were always
[37:12] fighting so how do you know when a
[37:14] Christian is
[37:16] carnal they're
[37:18] fighting fighting one another
[37:21] amen and most of the time it means
[37:24] nothing I said why are you fighting why
[37:26] are you going through through all these
[37:28] changes when it's all has to do with
[37:30] election and being chosen
[37:33] amen you can't put a person in heaven
[37:36] you can't take him
[37:38] out it is what it
[37:42] is you anyway let's move on you love the
[37:46] Lord I'm moving I'm I'm I'm taking too
[37:48] much time I'm sorry uh from the message
[37:51] the great warrior
[37:53] Joshua and I'm tying this into Ephesus
[37:56] because I don't Ephesus is a short book
[37:58] but I want to kind of make it last so we
[38:00] can see that ties right in if we don't
[38:04] understand that the inheritance that
[38:06] Paul says we have you say oh well God is
[38:09] giving it to you yes but you got to
[38:12] fight amen for every inch of it
[38:16] amen
[38:18] hallelujah yeah Paul say these wonderful
[38:20] things but you got to
[38:23] fight to obtain it it just doesn't come
[38:27] by reading the book of
[38:29] Ephesus or a chapter of it no he's
[38:33] telling you what is given to you you got
[38:36] to OB believe and you must
[38:40] obey that's how you get over amen that's
[38:43] how you become in the Statue of a
[38:45] perfect man obedience
[38:49] amen
[38:51] hallelujah you love the Lord listen in
[38:54] the paragraph 28 he says he's got a
[38:57] church tonight made up of all around the
[39:01] world he's got a lot things about it
[39:05] that's got to be iron out listen what
[39:07] brother says I can't iron them out I
[39:12] couldn't iron them out I don't know how
[39:15] to iron them out no other man can but
[39:20] that God's but that's God's business to
[39:23] do that he will take care of that it's
[39:27] not in the hands of man to do it but
[39:30] isn't that how we try to make it work
[39:33] amen no matter how many man made
[39:35] programs We rise up there ever there'll
[39:39] ever one fall just as sure as you raise
[39:42] them up but God himself will set up his
[39:46] program and his program is Jesus Christ
[39:50] as far as I know it is to be baptized
[39:52] into Christ and be led by the Holy
[39:55] Spirit free from condemnation
[39:58] and this is
[39:59] maturity this is
[40:02] maturity talking to brother today and we
[40:04] were talking about speaking squirrels
[40:07] speaking things in existence and I said
[40:09] well we concluded that that does not
[40:13] come by your way of thinking amen
[40:18] everything that brother brandham spoke
[40:20] to and it happened was inspired by the
[40:24] Holy Ghost that's right they that are
[40:27] led by the spirit amen you don't lead
[40:30] the spirit the spirit leads you amen and
[40:34] they that are led by the spirit they are
[40:37] the sons of God Amen and Joshua typed
[40:41] out the Holy Ghost amen leading the
[40:43] children of Israel and as long as they
[40:46] did what Joshua said do they won every
[40:49] battle amen that's right and as long as
[40:53] we do what the Holy Spirit tells us to
[40:55] do we win every battle
[40:57] even over this your body because this is
[41:01] your
[41:04] inheritance this is it you said well a
[41:07] let me tell you something the hardest
[41:09] thing to conquer is you amen that's
[41:13] right sir and only God can help you do
[41:16] that true the Holy Ghost is the only one
[41:18] can help you conquer this old man am and
[41:23] the devil knows every trick in the in
[41:25] the in in the book cuz he Liv with you
[41:27] long enough amen right he did the same
[41:31] thing to Israel once they came out of
[41:33] Egypt they thought they was all they way
[41:35] to you know to the promised land in
[41:37] which they were but all he had to do was
[41:40] stir up some of them old Natures fussing
[41:43] fighting complaining murmuring all of
[41:46] that until God said I'm tired of it see
[41:49] God don't like murmuring and complaining
[41:51] that's
[41:53] true that's what they that's why they
[41:55] were destroyed they did a lot of Filth
[41:58] they did a lot of things but it's listed
[42:00] that God got tired of there murmuring
[42:02] and complaining that's
[42:04] right I remember one time that I was one
[42:08] of my boys my baby was a one of them was
[42:10] a wher y'all know what a whiner is it's
[42:13] one of those little babies that'll sing
[42:14] a
[42:15] song like m m mama and he was standing
[42:21] in my door while my wife and I was
[42:23] trying to rest and I said oh I
[42:28] such was no Holy Ghost feeling either
[42:32] but such a holy such a feeling came over
[42:34] me I said I grabbed my wife I said if
[42:37] you don't get
[42:39] him in other words I'm coming out of
[42:42] this bed and an ain't GNA be
[42:44] fun so she stopped him and and I you
[42:48] know I love my I love my
[42:51] son I better not say that cuz he might
[42:53] be looking
[42:55] listening but you know it's just it was
[42:58] amazing how angry I got in such a split
[43:04] second and I could just liken God like
[43:06] that maybe not exactly like me but all
[43:10] you do is complain
[43:13] that what about this and what about that
[43:15] what you know and the Bible said then
[43:17] all things give thanks amen that's right
[43:20] all things you may not understand what
[43:23] you're going through but that all things
[43:25] give thanks will promote you you that's
[43:28] right that's your
[43:30] patience that's your
[43:32] faithfulness you can't be
[43:35] faithful without patience amen that's a
[43:39] quote you have to have patience to be
[43:42] faithful amen Joshua after seeing that
[43:46] good open that God open up the sea he
[43:50] said that settles it with me God opened
[43:53] up the sea before they left Egypt the
[43:56] Lord in the form of the pillar of fire
[43:59] that was whirling over the top of Moses
[44:01] and them standing there he said I will
[44:04] send my angel before you to keep you in
[44:06] the way and to bring you into the place
[44:10] which I have prepared
[44:13] hello and what we're saying what we're
[44:16] seeing is that he said I go away to
[44:19] prepare a place for
[44:21] you that where I am there you'll be also
[44:26] see he prepared had the promised land
[44:30] before they got there God then already
[44:32] told them about the greates and
[44:34] everything else the houses in the land
[44:36] yes and before we get where we're going
[44:39] he's already told us how glorious it's
[44:41] going to be Hallelujah but you got to
[44:45] fight and you got to believe the promise
[44:49] and you got to follow Joshua amen
[44:52] hallelujah who is Jesus Christ of our
[44:55] day and the Lord in the form of the pill
[44:57] of fire that was whing above oh Moses
[45:00] and them standing there he said I will
[45:02] send my angel before you to keep you in
[45:04] the way and to bring you into the place
[45:07] which I have prepared beware of him
[45:10] provoke him not see the the murmuring
[45:14] complaining beware of him provoke him
[45:17] not for my
[45:19] name can can you see it see uh for my
[45:22] name is in him right can you see it in
[45:26] other words grieve not the Holy Ghost
[45:28] sure it was Christ the anointed my name
[45:31] is in him Joshua seen him there like a
[45:34] man with the sword drawn and we see him
[45:37] today as a sin offering for sin the
[45:41] resurrected Emmanuel sitting at the
[45:43] right hand of the Majesty on high making
[45:46] intercessions and bringing to pass
[45:48] anything we confess that he's done for
[45:50] us hallelujah see right the man I could
[45:55] see lift up his sword High says no I'm
[45:59] the captain of the Lord's
[46:02] host the the god of Israel the captain
[46:05] of the host who was the captain of the
[46:07] host Joshua reached down unloosed his
[46:10] shoes fell on his face before and said
[46:14] what would the Lord have me do see after
[46:17] he had been he was
[46:19] getting he was getting his position then
[46:23] you see after he had been he was getting
[46:26] his his position then he was to be the
[46:29] greatest military man that ever seen on
[46:32] the face of the Earth they'll never be a
[46:35] general like
[46:37] Joshua amen hallelujah and I'm going say
[46:40] it like this whether people want to
[46:42] believe it or not Malachi 4 was the
[46:44] greatest of all generals amen that's the
[46:48] truth Billy Graham or Roberts all of
[46:50] them couldn't compare the ministry could
[46:53] not compare because what God was doing
[46:56] he was bringing about another
[46:58] Exodus a crossing over if you want to
[47:01] say it that way that's right the word
[47:03] Joshua comes from the word Jesus mean
[47:06] Jesus or savior deliverer and so when he
[47:10] seen this man what was it it was the
[47:13] captain in other words the leader of the
[47:16] host of Israel and the that leader was
[47:21] none other than Christ himself and that
[47:25] was he F that's and what was was he seen
[47:30] in a pill of fire now the pill of fire
[47:34] had become a man he said I hope you know
[47:37] what I'm talking about he had become a
[47:42] man do y'all get
[47:46] it the pill of fire that was above his
[47:49] head in our day is now wearing the image
[47:53] of a man amen amen amen this is what he
[47:58] trying to get over to you not that the
[48:00] man himself but what God was doing
[48:04] Ephesians
[48:05] 3 7 and
[48:11] 10 I tell you what I would not want to
[48:15] be in the shoes of these
[48:19] people who have cut Malachi for off and
[48:23] call him a false
[48:25] prophet I would not want to be in their
[48:29] shoes you may not understand everything
[48:32] but if you got any spirituality about
[48:34] you know you should know no man could
[48:37] have done the things he
[48:39] did amen no
[48:41] man and the only man I know that
[48:45] superseded him was Jesus Christ himself
[48:47] amen and that's who was doing the work
[48:50] in our day not the man it was Jesus
[48:53] Christ in the
[48:55] man Hallelujah alah Ephesians 3
[49:00] 7-10 Where whereof I Was Made a minister
[49:04] according to the gift of the grace of
[49:06] God given unto me by the effectual
[49:10] working of his power unto me who am less
[49:14] than the least of All Saints I love it
[49:18] such a great man but he humbles himself
[49:20] is this Grace given that I should preach
[49:23] among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[49:26] Riches of Christ you understand his
[49:30] feelings he was one who
[49:32] helped and he stood there and cheered
[49:36] the people to kill stepen and brother
[49:38] bam said he never got over that God used
[49:42] him use that to drive
[49:45] him into doing the works that he wanted
[49:47] him to do Paul was killed about three
[49:50] times noted dead amen and he raised up
[49:53] amen three times ston and all kinds of
[49:57] stuff happened to him am and he kept
[50:00] kept going kept going kept going and
[50:03] then at the end of the
[50:04] day he wasn't
[50:07] satisfied until his head was chopped
[50:11] off so you see by the grace of God when
[50:14] when God is anointing you to do
[50:18] something a True Believer that's all the
[50:20] vision you have amen nothing else you
[50:24] don't have nothing else in your vision
[50:26] you just is
[50:27] there focusing on what God wants you to
[50:30] do amen and you won't allow anything to
[50:33] get in your way
[50:35] amen
[50:37] right unto me who the least and I love
[50:40] that as I
[50:42] said to preach unto what the Bride of
[50:46] Jesus Christ Paul understood who he was
[50:49] preaching to because he said I would
[50:52] want I I I I trust and hope my ministry
[50:55] will present to Christ a Chase virgin
[50:58] amen so he understood he was preaching
[51:01] to the bride of Christ in his day that's
[51:04] how come brother Brandon stayed so true
[51:06] to the word because he knew he was
[51:08] preaching to the bride of Christ amen of
[51:11] his day I must tie it in so we can
[51:14] understand why he said Ephesians
[51:17] parallel Joshua amen it's a
[51:20] battle but we like Caleb give me my
[51:23] Mountain Lord we have something in view
[51:27] that we definitely want and that is that
[51:30] full adoption where all Heaven and Earth
[51:33] will recognize you and Obey you
[51:36] according to his
[51:38] inspiration and to make all men see what
[51:41] is the mystery or The Fellowship of the
[51:43] mystery which from the beginning of the
[51:46] world have been hid in God who created
[51:49] All Things by Jesus Christ one of the
[51:51] things that I have been meditating
[51:54] on is
[51:57] how is it going to be in in that
[52:01] City see we we're not on the
[52:04] outside we're in the city we're in the
[52:07] throne amen
[52:09] room and I I I just Tred to imagine
[52:13] sometimes uh you know not like I want to
[52:16] be served but can you have you ever felt
[52:18] the presence of the Holy Ghost so
[52:20] powerful and you hate to leave it and
[52:23] this is just a taste
[52:26] these bodies would not even be able to
[52:29] take the full
[52:30] impact of his
[52:34] Holiness sometime I get lost in that and
[52:38] and at the same time I recognize how
[52:41] unworthy I am amen I'm unworthy even to
[52:45] preach to God's
[52:46] bride this is this is this is nothing to
[52:49] play
[52:50] with and I know that and just to be uh
[52:55] who I am
[52:58] and I told the Lord
[53:00] today I'm going do everything that you
[53:03] ordained me to do
[53:07] amen like brother random said if I end
[53:09] up in
[53:10] hell at least I could say I did what he
[53:12] wanted me to do amen and they're going
[53:15] to have a hard time with
[53:17] me CU I'll praise him even then Lord
[53:22] amen amen they'll know I'm there brother
[53:24] that's right because the pro truth of
[53:27] the matter is what's real is real and
[53:30] whatever you are here is what you going
[53:31] to be there amen how you going to
[53:35] stop how you going to stop loving him
[53:37] either way how there's no way you know
[53:40] why because he's in you amen that's
[53:44] amazing to me I I you know that's kind
[53:47] of sound crazy
[53:49] but honestly I I think to myself
[53:52] sometime I said if I can't make Heaven
[53:54] I'd rather be burned Till There is
[53:56] nothing left
[53:57] left cuz to be left in
[54:01] Consciousness that you miss heaven and
[54:03] God and you'll never see him again or
[54:04] ever come into His presence that's far
[54:07] worse than a fire amen being consumed
[54:10] y'all understand me to
[54:12] me it would be
[54:14] best to be dissolved go into nothing
[54:19] amen if that makes
[54:20] sense because I tell you what just the
[54:23] idea of not being in his presence is
[54:27] torment
[54:29] enough listen to make all men see what
[54:32] is the Fellowship of the
[54:34] mystery what Fellowship this is where
[54:36] where he says now now you understand you
[54:38] got to be a fellowship you you can't
[54:40] just not Fellowship that means you got
[54:42] to study it you got to read it you got
[54:44] to enjoy it you know when you
[54:46] fellowshipping somebody somebody he's
[54:48] feeding you like on the road to EMAs did
[54:51] not our hearts burn it was a feeding the
[54:54] message must fellowship with you you
[54:56] must fellowship with the word amen
[54:59] that's right which from the beginning of
[55:01] the world have been hid in God who
[55:05] created All Things by Jesus Christ and
[55:07] this what we must understand people of
[55:10] God many people would love to hear and
[55:13] see what you seeing amen that's the and
[55:16] they
[55:16] cannot because they've not been chosen
[55:19] to do
[55:21] so and so when a person doesn't see this
[55:23] message you don't jump all over them
[55:26] your heart goes out amen you love them
[55:30] you understand me that's right reason
[55:33] being they're family amen foolish
[55:36] version is family amen they'll be
[55:40] there not only them but those who gave
[55:43] you a good drink of water lord those who
[55:46] feared you in the name of Jesus Amen
[55:49] they won't be B but they'll be there am
[55:52] that's what we don't we we we we can't
[55:55] be Pharisee about this thing we better
[55:57] say Lord thank you for your grace and
[55:59] your
[56:00] mercy anyway to the intent that now unto
[56:05] the principalities and powers in
[56:08] Heavenly places might be known by the
[56:11] church the manifold wisdom of
[56:15] God manifold that means many folds amen
[56:20] he took it it took to save
[56:23] you a great adversary called the
[56:26] level God
[56:29] outsmarting in every way came down to
[56:32] his level and he still couldn't with him
[56:35] amen so you got to understand what this
[56:38] whole battle was about this battle that
[56:41] that Israel is
[56:43] fighting she's fighting the same
[56:46] Devils we're
[56:49] fighting they're concentrating over
[56:52] there because they know they coming here
[56:54] too y'all understand me
[56:57] and we know what this whole thing is
[56:59] about making a covenant making the stock
[57:03] market fall and crash and whatever more
[57:06] and putting us in a position of
[57:08] desperation cuz many of us are not
[57:10] desperate
[57:11] enough but I tell you what God knows how
