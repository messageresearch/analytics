TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh my solo fires eally West Tahoe eagle and gospel desire healing and raising the day give me the power Jesus amen whoo that's for exactly right that's what you know the Prophet God said that's what we need burning Holy Ghost a burning fire let me just read it just the way it is I didn't say I didn't read that this morning but that's what he says what is need today is some fire in the ball what it needs today is some steam what it needs today to church to boil and he says the hardest boiling thing there is to boil sin out of your life is love if you can't love one another how you're going to love God who you haven't seen love hides a multitude of sin get in love with God then you'll love one another then you'll love the church you'll love the cause you'll love everything that godly and you'll keep away from the things of the world whoo amen to that one hallelujah amen that's from enticing spirits you know I tell you what I can't say it no better oh I read it amen you love the Lord amen God is so good to us I don't know about you but I've been really enjoying and do I get tired I enjoy the battle because I know as long as we're fighting and I'm in the battle still alive amen so God is good to us let us turn to Psalms 103 please Psalms 103 this Psalm is especially the beginning of it is one of my favorite I love them all but Psalms 103 is where God when he saved me this is what God gave me the first few verses but I'm going to be reading by God's grace from the 17th verse I believe is where I'm at yes Psalms 103 17 through 22 but the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his Commandments to do them the Lord had prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom rule if over all bless the Lord all ye his angels that excel in strength that do His commandments and hearken unto the voice of his word would you please stop Danielle let's see the Lord all you his host his ministers of his that do his pleasure bless the Lord and all his works in all places of his Dominion bless the Lord O my soul ain't a goose let us pray father we thank you right now for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your love we thank you for being so good to us father we pray right now that your word would have preeminence in our lives Lord be our headship be our guide direct us Lord correct us Lord whatever we need o God to to be pleasing in eyesight give us grace Lord Jesus change our hearts O God into your heart let us love the things you love and let us hate the things you hate father we want to be and desire to be one with you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I'm sorry about that I just had to stop that sometime children get on the inspirations and they don't even know what what's moving them sometime my brother Adam said is when you began to do something the baby started crying and the baby don't even doesn't even know he's being inspired by the devil but there's only the devil that will in interrupts God without any respect but we want to read we want to just give a little thought we know that tonight is communion night and we've been just dealing with so many things and I'm excited to know and that revelation that God has given to me I'm so excited about knowing where I'm headed it's not enough to hear the prophet of God saying I came from God and that go back to God it's not enough just even here Jesus says I come from God and I go back to God but when you know you come from God when God drops that revelation in your heart there's nothing on earth can change you nothing can deter you from your destiny it's amazing now marvel at God and that maybe I shouldn't sometimes I find myself in all he's a mastermind how he does it you know I don't know you probably you know take eternity just explaining to me just one little facet of himself all I know is that I'm in love with him in such a way that I feel him every day I feel his pull every day I he talks to me he directs me he guides me and I still cannot even explain to you how he does it sometimes he talks and sometimes he doesn't talk sometimes it's just an inspiration it's just somehow he gets the message over and I no by God's grace that there been times when I have had the intention to pray and didn't get to it and yet he heard it and he answered the very thoughts of my heart I mean their time that God would answer without me even asking and all these things happens only to draw me closer to him I realize they meant what God has do to me when I think about the creation and how God desired to fellowship with his creation it excites it excites me because I'm his creation you are his creation and here God's what God wants to fellowship with you and I'm saying to myself law help me help me help me help me help me hurry help me to die and rot and to disappear so I can fellowship with you like you purposed in your mind to fellowship with me and then you've heard me say how that God rules everything I love the idea that God uses a prophet I really love that idea because we're living in a time where there are so many voices I just wouldn't know which one to listen to but because we know that God uses a property every time God's people got in trouble God would raise a man who would become his voice and we remember why that happened right because when Israel them came to Mount Sinai and the mountains roared and ripped and the voice of God thunders the people were so afraid they told Moses shut him up shut him up we don't want to hear Moses we're listening to you now and from that point on God began to you who's a prophet as his voice because when he would come naked Li it was care the skin off of us and you and I must realize Amen that in his self was the grace of God but let me tell you something did is think this is the greatest prophet I've ever known because the word is God the word is Jesus Christ and he God is the only one that can reveal it to you he's the prophet of all prophets no man can destroy this word brother van Branagh was the visibility of the of the God that we know as being invisible and you got to understand what I mean by that it was because God lived in him like he lives in us we are to become the visibility of God of the unseen God is that right that's why the prophet of God spoke a message the unveiling of God so that we can see that it wasn't a man humanity that was God it was God veiled behind humanity and God is veiled behind us now we become the Prophet or the prophets of the age and all we're doing is resounding what has already been sounded like I was telling the brother today when I was speaking I said I'm in his stead the prophets dead and I wasn't equating myself to being a prophet but I was telling him about the service I said I'm like Micah to Jeremiah when when when God allowed four hundred deceiving spirits to come deceive a hab and the rest of them Micah was the only one that says I that's not what Jeremiah said and he was just a witness to what God had already said - Jeremiah I'm a witness of what God has already said through the prophet of God Malachi for brother Branham however you want to say it we are the resounding we have heard what he said and therefore we listening to see if any other come and say something different from what has been said and we can stand like Micah no matter what you say that's not the way Jeremiah said it and that's not the way it's going to happen is that right and when that false prophet slapped there are Michael says where did the spirit ago when he left me Michael said you'll find out when he returns hallelujah what was it God a man brought judgment on that man that other man who claimed to be a prophet for touching the anointed of God I say all of that to say this kingdom in which God has prepared and establish cannot be moved is that right that 19th verse said the Lord have prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruling over all now this scripture was written before acts 2:38 ever came on the scene before God established his kingdom in the earth by way of the baptism of the Holy Ghost this kingdom existed hallelujah and this kingdom Amen that God is talking about was established with God before time ever wash we're now here manifesting the invisible we have now become the visible and God amen is not not whooping we'll be victorious but the Bible has already told us we rule it I love that word over all y'all hear me that's what Jesus even told his disciples that if you believe all things are possible to them that believe in my name they're cast out Devils in my name they tread upon serpents hallelujah what was he saying in my name you are going to rule over all this is what the bride has come to do we didn't come to fail or to fall we come to rule this is why amen when God gave the prophets God he meant when he gave him the Kings sword he did past the Kings sword unto the believer which is the revealed word for today and he said it's going to take a strong hand a strong hand of faith amen to operate this thing hallelujah and this is what makes us different because we in this age must come into the full stature of Christ every virtue from Ephesus all the way up must be backed into each and individual body called the bride whoo in the devil may come in a seventh Oh fight and battle but God has given us a Sevenfold victory hallelujah he's given us everything amen we need to defeat the devil hallelujah is that right emphasis under the inspiration of faith defeated the devil of his day yah he would have say and slurred I needed that virtue and they defeated the devil of that day hallelujah and therefore we have come came in with every virtue and is that right the prophet of God said Amen that this battle that we'll have today be seven times hotter then what this a track meshach and abednego went through he said the fire would be heated seven times hotter so let it be because God has equipped us with what it takes to defeat the devil on his territory is that right the Prophet God said the wild of God is able to defeat the devil any place anywhere anyhow under any condition that word of God will defeat the devil hallelujah and I am a witness so are you and when we needed someone to help us to redirect us you know how to devil is he come to steal kill and destroy so whenever he could come in to do these things among the believers he will do it you know in order to defeat Jericho God told him to keep your mouth shut y'all know that's that's so important right now they had to march around seven times right and then on that sixth day or that seventh day had to about seven times so I want you to understand is it so important for you and I to keep the mouth shut James said Amen if a man cannot bridle his tongue his race is it religion is in vain so we need to understand that gossiping and backbiting and misjudging and saying a lot of things that we ought not to be saying gives it gives you enemy leave way into our camp hallelujah but if you keep your mouth shut he doesn't know what's going on in your camp somebody help me here I'm learning these things you allowed to devil know your weakness by your mouth and when you keep your mouth shut the devil has no idea where you are hallelujah and when you have you blooming in the inspiration of the Lord you know one thing for sure you don't gossip backbite whatever the case may be all the fruits of this nasty little tongue you keep and shut down and the victory is yours the victory is y'all hear me the victory is yours when you can brighter the tongue is that right because James said if you can't brighter the tongue your religion is in vain and unless you just blew your cover hallelujah oh my help come from the Lord all of my help comes from the Lord all of my help comes from the Lord is that what David said and David was deep David was a powerful man he had a great revelation every word David speaks out of his mouth need to be closely examined because when David said he's my buckler and shield you don't know what David went through hallelujah but with that buckler and that shield needs a lot hallelujah in Davis inspiration and so you must understand it is powerful when you think about what David went through and David was a worshiper and we says all my help comes from the Lord in other words I don't get help from nobody else all my help come from the Lord who made heaven and earth were the maker of heaven and earth is mindful of my trials and my tribulation and when I call upon him he has never failed me he is that ride he said I was in a horrible pit and I called upon his name and he lifts me up and placed my foot on the rock Oh David knew what he was talking about he said if you put your trust in God and all your trust and all your help come from God God will answer your prayer that's why I tell you what it's something how prophets can tap into the mind of God and bring those words right on down to us because David was a prophet and David was so in tune with God every time he's y'all heard me say this before but here one of his songs basically became the Word of God hallelujah it wasn't his thoughts he was in another dimension when he said all the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want hey man you must step right into his shoes and say the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want even when you can just get into the depths of his words then you become as he is and his god becomes to you as it was your David he's a man of my own heart whoo I love it because God knows how to respond you know me if you search the word you'll find out that everything you need is in this message hallelujah you don't have to go to the department store somebody else's store and get what you need everything you need in this hour is locked up writing the message you just got to look for it hello somebody think about it those prophets knew how to respond think about it here was Moses a prophet of God amen who was the voice of God and they didn't want to listen to a minion was hard hit it just like it is today amen but you see he was a voice of God they were all fearful when they saw Pharaoh coming after them even Moses got a little disarrayed until God took God God is the teacher what are you crying for I've given you the ability why cry here speak it you understand me and when Moses spoke hallelujah Oh nature y'all hear what I'm saying that that's when you sing that song he'll make a way out of no way cuz there was no way out hallelujah Amen though the bouches on one side the ocean of the Riverland in front of them and Pharaoh coming nowhere they were trapped but if you can enter into the inspiration of Moses then you realize what the Word of God says with every temptation God has already made a way of escape hallelujah and you got to say to God show me the leave me into the way out of this thing it's there you just gotta find where's that hallelujah is that right with a word when a prophet speech you gotta understand that's God speaking through the man hallelujah it proves it when they was in battle and Josh was his son stand still I'm gonna bring it to you I'm gonna bring the same thing the point is if we get to a place where we can live in that place where the Prophet lived it becomes whatsoever you say is that right we can't put it on somebody else you got to know God for yourself and when you get to the place where you have allowed God to take you into that statue of Christ he said whatever you say oh is that right I don't know what's wrong with folks but you know it like they said I'm climbing Jacob's Ladder hallelujah and every round goes higher higher no matter what I gotta go through perfection is my goal is that right not because of me because of him one of these old days I will be fully enveloped by him I'll be in him and he'll be in me and we'll be in him amen that's my goal not this earthly toils and trials and tribulations and this ain't nothing but a garbage dump hallelujah but I'm going to a kingdom haha like those old people would say it'll be howdy howdy and never goodbye no more death no more no more nothing to die everything is to live Florida God think about it and what we need to do is allow this message to take away the amnesia No that's what I prayed Lord take away the amnesia take take away what I don't remember because I was with you somewhere I was there and whatever I need to remember to get me over there again take away the amnesia hallelujah is that right the bump says we got to stop we got to quit thinking like men and that's what we do we we've spent our day thinking like a man God don't want you thinking like a man God wants you to think like a god hallelujah is like Paul said when I was a child I spoke like a child but once I became a man I put away childish things now you are a man but God said put away the main things speak like a god oh come on somebody in stir truth that's what he told his disciples you said what they did you need this great inspiration I believe that everything is inspired by God but let me tell you something when those people those those those fair I'll excuse me when it's disciples was on the boat neighbor's crossing going over cross the other side and those old Devils thought I'm gonna sink him huh and guess what all that humanity was standing on edge hallelujah and Peter's crying out loud can't doubt not that we perish how can you be sleeping over there what they failed to see God had already given them the word they did not need nothing but the word that's all they ever needed and the word though he being understanding if they needed an inspiration if they needed some kind of flash or if they needed some kind of you know hair-raising hair-raising experience he would not rebuke them but he rebuked him and said ye of little faith where did you down why he had already taught them I had gone home their power they had strength they had authority is that right he told him that here they were preaching casting out Devils and everything else and then they couldn't see the invisible and they couldn't see that they were Devils behind the wind the rain the stolen and all they had to do was be a little spiritual and speak the word and the storm would have stopped otherwise he rebuked them to his rebuke was out of place but he knew what he had talked to him but we get in this pillar calls the rim we got to see something flash before we move no you got the word and when you know the word speak it you don't have to feel goosebumps or some rushing wind that's why people don't get the Holy Ghost because they think the Holy Ghost and you know I've been there you think oh I got to feel this and I've got to feel that no shock you know what you got to do believe that receive it and believe it and act upon it hallelujah feelings may come later but it may not come at the time you receive it but people think oh I got a cry got a shout I got a fast and you know I used to be there but I find out now all you need is a faith to activate the word that has already been given what feeling did Mary have when the angel told her this thing that being you is of the Holy Ghost he did say this thing that was coming he said this thing that be that means he was already there and she didn't feel a thing no somebody but she where and she testified of it I've got the Living God in me guess what Elizabeth and his name shall be called Jesus Johnson John had a had a Jubilee in the belly of his mom oh I wish I'd have seen that I was out of in there cuz that belly was like oh Lord oh God Elizabeth got too happy to come oh yo yeah it's alright it's alright if God that name can resurrect the dead baby what about a dead Christian Oh somebody that needs something now all my help come from the Lord the thing I love about David is David knew how to pray mmm he knew how to contact God hallelujah and remember how to contact God hallelujah God will respond as I was saying we have amnesia amnesia amnesia this word has come to take away the amnesia but you gotta believe it whether you feel it or not you don't have to feel it you don't have to see it amen oh like Mary she never saw it until after she believed it it's like you're healing well the pain is still there that means you didn't believe it if you receive in the pain you didn't believe it because in the spiritual realm when I believe it I ignore the pain the pain can't get worse all the pain is getting worse you didn't believe it you just took away your healing some of it that right you mean to tell me you got to feel it before you can believe it that's been a costume oh you got to believe it is that right just like I tell the people I say when I pray for your children and their temperature is a hundred in something and you bring them and I pray for them why do you go back and see whether the temperature is going down yet because you know what's going to happen you that temperature culture is gonna make you feel you like it's gotten worse especially if it went up to 104 and if you say it oh my god she's getting worse take the baby to the doctor don't play with it cuz you did not have faith faith does not examine what God has already said has happened yeah I don't see faith do not do that faith accepts it without any visible sight how was that man John Ryan was gonna receive his sight when he didn't even know what sight was extra have to read all about it I'm healed he goes back up to brother Bradley says but you said that I was healed and I can't see still and brother bet him said but you said you believe but you said you believe because if you believe no matter what it looks like you believe and your faith will bring it to pass and its own appointed time but when you say always getting worse and all of that no no no go ask God for some more faith because you just lost whatever you had amnesia is caused by a brain shock most of the time some kind of injury like I said you know coming into this life it brought injury sometime amen fear shocks you right it's like the children of Israel when they were fighting Goliath and David here was a man who's who who saw what God has done he's seen it how God destroyed the bear and the lion and everything he's in revival he's coming up bringing amen the biscuits and whatever more and he looks everybody and if you've ever seen chickens afraid to die they all bunch up into a corner like I've seen it I've seen it in reality I was overseas and they're getting ready and I thought this is horrible they they killing this chicken in front of the other chickens didn't like what they were seeing and they backed up in that corner like oh and I thought to myself I said that's just how Christians do they see one Christian fail or something fall of faith they get all scared hallelujah we're not afraid of enemy but nevertheless we find out by God's grace amen we've got to come to a place to realize first of all we're not chickens we're Eagles and that's what those were Davis brothers and all of them you know they they Sloan and David because he was such a wimpy looking guy and God still used that wimpy looking guy to destroy the giant that they was afraid of hallelujah you might not look like much but all you got to do is believe it receive it and you'll defeat every giant that God puts in your place in your face is that right because those are the Israel for God said wait a minute Dave said huh is there not a cause you mean to tell me this uncircumcised Philistine is defying the army of the Lord and y'all are afraid of this land what is wrong with you is there not a cause let me say it like this to us you see around this message people are failing is there not a cause for somebody to arm themselves and take all the goliath of this day is there not a cause I'm tired of history we need book of Acts written in our day right now and it's gonna take people who are not afraid to surrender we're saying give up everything for the cause of Christ we can't just walk out here let the devil just defeat us the way he's been doing look at the people everywhere you go they're becoming more worldly it's true they becoming more worldly they be coming with the appearance of being godly and having no power at all that's not the bride of Jesus Christ she may not be in great numbers but there are still God said I never loved leave myself without a witness somebody a man is going to stand up to this is Goliath of the day somebody realized they are in the real kingdom of God somebody somebody no they have been chosen and elected to be Brian and they're not gonna let nothing get in their way somebody here hallelujah we've done the same thing Pizza coast is done we got our favorite preachers huh they got their favorite Thrones they got their followings all of their little camps like like we had in the days of Moses huh everybody is interpreting everybody wanna be something good all surely Moses and stuff he's the greatest one and you better leave it alone hallelujah just fall in line with God then put you hallelujah we're just an echo and Rhys how amen what he has sounded they're not trying to outdo him we on the same team hallelujah Oh glory to God and what we need to do is fall in line and let God get the glory like Malachi for did let God get the glory and we as men just humble ourselves and become nothing that's the only way it's gonna be the way it used to be when you and I can say like Peter silver and gold have I none in other words I'm nobody I ain't trying to be nobody but such as I have give I D mmm hallelujah what we need is God to give us some kind of shock to bring us back to our senses be like a David like eight I'll die in this battle but I'm not gonna let this giant I'm not gonna let the Church of the Living God go down like a loser I'm not gonna happen not in my watch not in my watch let everybody else become history let everybody else do what they gotta do but God's gonna have a voice of it ain't up at one who I feel the presence of the Lord God needs somebody that's gonna stand up and and and and don't worry about these Philistines you say we're in this message God even warned Brenham Tabernacles at brendham tavern that kind of Philistines is among you even then and what now they have progressed and basically have taken over the message surely they've covered our denomination that's what is happenin organized you don't have to you denominated brothers fighting against brothers huh when is it gonna live when somebody gonna press into that divine love and gonna love no matter what how you treat me imma love you anyway you separate yourself for me I love you anyway you called me means I'm gonna love you anyway doesn't matter I'm going to love you anyway why because I got the love of God in me and my thing is I am in I'm ambitious in my in my walk to see the word that Malachi 4 spoke come to pass because I realized that's Jesus Christ speaking through the man that there will be a prophet of perfect bride a little bride a little group that will take a rapture and I'm one of them Oh help me Lord Jesus see the Lord is our strength and sometime the enemy comes in like a flood you know and you have heard about that little story Amen with with Hezekiah how hezekiah how that enemy came against Hezekiah and during the time of Isaiah and and and and and I kind of what was his name I read it in just a minute but nevertheless Hezekiah thought I better go pray because this man is threatening and he's talking about killing me and everything else and I better praying you know I need to find now you know what what what the outcome is and I better send a letter or something over to Isaiah and let him know what's going on hey see when you really want to know what's going on you consult him I didn't have no wisdom it was God's wisdom in the man but when there's not one that you can turn to you can always turn to God in prayer hallelujah and whenever you turn to God and prayer he'll turn the pages of this book and said this is where you are and this is what you need to do with what you have yeah man the battles have already been fought in the victory has already been wah whoa somebody help me here oh my god here's a car which means strength of the Lord whoa come on somebody but let me read this thing and it came to pass calling the second Kings 19 and it came to pass when King Hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord and he sent Alya CEM which was over the household and shebna described and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to either the prophet the son of amos and they said unto Him thus said Hezekiah the day is a day of trouble and a rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there's not strength to bring forth hallelujah y'all understand me in other words Amen this this King this king let me turn to that because I want to find out I can't remember his name real quick this King had Elijah I mean scuse me had threatened Hezekiah and they were afraid because this man had a reputation and he could do the threat he put out it wasn't something that he was hoping that he could do no no he could do it and we find out that Hezekiah yes he got nervous he got scred right but god amen had already seen the wait a minute y'all understand what I'm saying nothing catches God by surprise you know the Bible said he is the author and the finisher of our faith that means every test every trial every storm every battle he has already fixed it he's already set up he put you in a position and he put the opposition in a position he's seen the battle he knows the victory of the battle he knows when you go into the battle and he knows when you come out of the bath y'all understand what I'm saying and see what did did that God do it was with this situation he uh Hezekiah consulted a prophet so the Prophet was able to catch the mind of God and send a letter back a mentor to Hezekiah says listen don't you worry about it it's already in the bag God has already featured for you Hezekiah and this was the response so the servant of the king came to hell Isaiah and Isaiah said unto them thus shall you say to your master thus said the Lord be not afraid of the words with da has heard with which the servant of the king of Assyria has blaspheme me behold I will send a blast upon him and he shall hear rumor and she returned to his own lair and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land in other words don't you worry about the threat God has already fixed it for you y'all understand what I'm saying we don't worry about the threats that comes out of people's mouths hallelujah you got to remember where you're standing the Bible said if you abide in my word and my word abide in you you can ask whatsoever you will and it shall be given unto you hallelujah and as a trash the Bible says if two or three are gathered in my name touching and agreeing upon anything whatsoever you ask it to be given unto you how can we lose it how can we lose about all you go fight you've got a battle to go through but you got to go through his battle with faith and not unbelief hallelujah don't he try to fight it with unbelief at least David's brothers was up against the wall running from Goliath because they'd couldn't believe it they couldn't believe they could win the battle who can defeat this giant but here come a little lad hallelujah who had been with the Living God and what did he say who is this uncircumcised he could care less about how big Goliath Goliath was how big his sword was that's what everybody was looking at how big look a bigger sword but he David wasn't looking through the eyes of a shepherd boy he was looking through the eyes of the king of the shepherd hallelujah he was looking down hallelujah is that the truth oh it's the truth it's the truth it's the same thing Josh when Caleb did when they went over there where the Chinese were everybody else was looking up at the Giants hallelujah Josh when Caleb was looking down at the tire because they were in heavenly places your battle is where you position yourself if you position yourself about the battle the battle is nothing to you but if you find yourself in the midst of the battle trying to fight you become wounded you become hurt but when you up here and that devil can't touch hmm am i make him since I'm almost done ah is that right that's what David said Psalms 121 1-3 see that's why I say I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from with cometh my help my help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth who is this Goliath what is this storm I'm going through hallelujah y'all got to understand the early church they understood they had a revelation that the Jesus Christ that they served was the same God that Moses and the rest on serve is that right they understood stories about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they knew that God came to their rescue hallelujah they understood those stories they knew they meant that same God was still available today and when they said oh we're gonna turn those Lions on you and you did gonna eat you they're gonna break your bones they're gonna chew you up those old times say says where are they hallelujah according to history they ran toward the Lions they didn't run away from hallelujah that alrigh Peter came to understand that the Jesus that he denied three times was a very God of heaven and earth hallelujah it took him some suffering he had to go through something to come to that point but then Peter came to I didn't understand but the kingdom of God was all about because God then gave Peter and men the keys to the kingdom and it wasn't some natural key it was a spiritual key he said I'm gonna give you the keys you got to have virtue you got to have knowledge you got to have long-suffering you must happen that the character of
