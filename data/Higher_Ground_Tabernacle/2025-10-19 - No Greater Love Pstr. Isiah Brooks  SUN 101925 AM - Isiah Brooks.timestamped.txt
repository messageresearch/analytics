[38:21] that there
[38:23] are angels
[38:26] all around.
[38:34] Let us pray
[38:38] [Applause]
[38:40] [Music]
[38:42] Jesus
[38:45] now.
[38:48] [Music]
[38:51] For we are tending
[38:55] in
[38:57] his presence and woods on the holy
[39:02] ground.
[39:05] [Music]
[39:07] Amen. Amen.
[39:11] We give honor to our Lord and Savior
[39:13] Jesus Christ this morning. Thank God for
[39:17] everybody being here.
[39:21] Amen. We just uh
[39:25] want to draw your attention to the
[39:27] scripture
[39:33] according to St. John 3
[39:40] verse 17- 17
[39:46] &gt;&gt; and then we'll go to Romans.
[39:50] for chapter 17- 21.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; We ought to be the happiest creatures in
[40:02] the world.
[40:06] [Music]
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Coming to church should never be a
[40:09] burden.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; As the word of God said, I was glad when
[40:17] they said unto me,
[40:21] Let us go into the house of the Lord.
[40:25] I am so grateful
[40:28] &gt;&gt; to be one of them
[40:31] and I trust that you are as well
[40:35] St. John 3
[40:38] beginning at the 13th verse.
[40:44] And no man hath ascended up to heaven,
[40:47] but he that came down from heaven, even
[40:50] the Son of man which is in heaven.
[41:04] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[41:06] the wilderness, even so must the Son of
[41:09] Man be lifted up.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; And who that whosoever believeth in him
[41:23] should not perish, but have eternal
[41:27] life.
[41:33] For God so loved the world, oh I love
[41:36] this, that he gave his only begotten son
[41:39] that whosoever believeth in him should
[41:41] not perish but have everlasting life.
[41:53] For God sent not his son into the world
[41:56] to condemn the world, but that the world
[41:59] through him might be saved.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Romans 4,
[42:15] &gt;&gt; beginning at the 17th verse.
[42:24] I know some have gone to uh brother
[42:27] Joseph's wedding and I just pray
[42:32] &gt;&gt; that God will give them a safe trip
[42:34] home.
[42:40] While while I'm thinking about it,
[42:43] &gt;&gt; we we will not have service on
[42:45] Wednesday.
[42:50] I've had
[42:53] uh two close
[42:56] I call them brothers, relatives, however
[42:58] you want to call it.
[43:09] Brother um
[43:13] Bobby Wartz
[43:16] &gt;&gt; passed a few days ago.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; He is the man who was responsible
[43:25] for harmony in the desert.
[43:30] Desert.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Then my pastor's wife died.
[43:36] Yes.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; A couple of days ago
[43:46] &gt;&gt; and uh so we'll be uh traveling to both
[43:50] of those funerals.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; One is on Thursday
[43:58] &gt;&gt; and hopefully the other one will be on
[44:00] Saturday.
[44:04] So pray for the warts family
[44:08] &gt;&gt; the warts family
[44:10] &gt;&gt; and uh pray for brother Charles
[44:12] Anderson's
[44:14] &gt;&gt; George Anderson
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Charles Anderson
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Charles Anderson
[44:18] &gt;&gt; and and his family
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Romans the 4th chapter
[44:29] &gt;&gt; 17 to the 21st verse
[44:34] As it is written, I have made thee a
[44:37] father of many nations
[44:40] before him whom he believed,
[44:43] even God who quickened the dead, and
[44:45] callest those things that be not as
[44:48] though they were.
[45:04] Who against hope believeth in hope that
[45:08] might be that he might become the father
[45:10] of many nations according to that which
[45:14] was spoken. So shall thy seed be.
[45:31] And being not weak in faith, he
[45:34] considered not his own body now dead
[45:37] when he was about a hundred years old,
[45:40] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[45:43] womb.
[45:57] He staggered not at the promise of God
[46:01] through unbelief but was con but was
[46:04] strong in faith giving glory to God
[46:16] and being fully persuaded that what he
[46:20] had promised
[46:22] he was able also to perform.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Gracious Father God, we thank you for
[46:36] your grace.
[46:38] We thank you for your mercy and all that
[46:41] you do for us.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for the good times.
[46:46] We thank you for the bad times
[46:49] because we realize Lord
[46:52] things have to be
[46:55] however you have determined them to be
[47:00] they will be. And so therefore we
[47:03] glorify you
[47:05] because of our life.
[47:08] It could not have been any better
[47:12] than it has been
[47:14] because you knew every choice
[47:17] &gt;&gt; and every decision
[47:20] &gt;&gt; we would make.
[47:22] But one thing I glorify you for
[47:26] because you said all things
[47:28] work together for the good of them
[47:32] that love the Lord.
[47:35] We thank you, Father God, that even when
[47:37] we mess up,
[47:40] you know how to restore.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father God,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; for being who you are.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; And there is none like you, for you are
[47:50] the only true living God. And in your
[47:53] name, Jesus Christ, we thank you, Father
[47:56] God.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[48:02] I have been just
[48:07] enjoying the word
[48:11] &gt;&gt; and um reminiscing
[48:14] &gt;&gt; over the service that we had
[48:19] uh just the other day.
[48:24] And I wanted to kind of reassure you
[48:26] this morning
[48:29] that we have no need to worry.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Those of us who are chosen, those of us
[48:38] who are elected,
[48:41] God is in full control.
[48:44] I think one of the elements that we do
[48:46] miss
[48:48] when it comes to our salvation,
[48:52] we want God to love us.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; But my question is to this morning,
[48:59] how much do you love him?
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Because love is reciprocated.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; It is not a one-way street.
[49:12] Love goes both ways.
[49:15] And we've often heard people say,
[49:19] &gt;&gt; "I love him because he first loved me."
[49:25] &gt;&gt; One of the things that
[49:27] we know
[49:30] by way of this message
[49:33] is that the Lord is soon to come.
[49:36] However you want to phrase it,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; we are about to make a translation.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; And we are behind time.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; I believe that we are living in the
[49:49] longsuffering of God
[49:52] as it was in the days of Noah.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Judgment should have happened
[49:58] &gt;&gt; years ago,
[50:01] &gt;&gt; but God has extended his love.
[50:04] uh uh for us. So because the bride must
[50:09] make herself ready
[50:14] my my subject this morning would be
[50:18] &gt;&gt; no greater love
[50:21] but if I had a subtopic
[50:25] it would be captured
[50:28] &gt;&gt; by his love.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Only a few people in here perhaps
[50:35] knows what it means to be captured by
[50:37] love.
[50:41] It means you have become imprisoned
[50:46] by the love that you have towards
[50:47] someone
[50:50] and sometimes you might wish wish that
[50:54] you did not have those kind of feelings.
[50:59] But it seems like no matter what the
[51:01] person may do to you,
[51:05] You love them still.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; You are captured,
[51:11] &gt;&gt; imprisoned
[51:13] by such a love.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; And that kind of love is not a bad love.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; It's just that kind
[51:22] that will bring pain
[51:26] because people will never
[51:29] be what you want them to be.
[51:33] And so is it with us.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; The only reason why
[51:38] &gt;&gt; we become to uh we we come to the place
[51:42] &gt;&gt; that God has uh ordained us to come to
[51:47] is because of his sovereign love
[51:50] and his sovereign grace.
[51:54] The prophet of God says it like this
[51:58] in the serpent seed
[52:00] paragraph 70.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I want to ask you
[52:04] something.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Is there eternal security?"
[52:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible said. So
[52:14] &gt;&gt; the Bible said that that our names
[52:18] &gt;&gt; were put on the lamb's book of life
[52:22] &gt;&gt; before the world ever began.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Now it takes something in you
[52:33] to believe that.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about your head.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about in your heart.
[52:44] Because when you realize
[52:47] &gt;&gt; you are secured
[52:50] &gt;&gt; eternally,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; it produces a love.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; It's like when people do things for you
[53:01] &gt;&gt; and you know you you don't deserve it,
[53:05] &gt;&gt; but they do it because they love you.
[53:08] Something registers in the human heart.
[53:13] and and you'll say to yourself,
[53:16] "I'll never forget that person,
[53:20] &gt;&gt; you know, true love
[53:23] &gt;&gt; constrains
[53:26] a person.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; It literally compels you. It's like a
[53:32] force.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:35] Uh, you know, you you you might say,
[53:39] &gt;&gt; uh, I'm not going to ever forgive you,
[53:43] &gt;&gt; but real love, true love
[53:46] will force you
[53:49] &gt;&gt; to forgive,
[53:52] &gt;&gt; it is something that you won't and
[53:55] cannot control.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; And so is it with God.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; God is never out of control.
[54:05] But his love toward us
[54:09] &gt;&gt; is love is controlled.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; It's it's a constraining force
[54:16] &gt;&gt; that when you do wrong
[54:19] &gt;&gt; that love of God
[54:22] brings you back to a place
[54:25] to do right.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now when we look
[54:31] at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[54:35] and we see by God's grace,
[54:38] &gt;&gt; the Bible said that he set his face like
[54:40] a flint,
[54:44] &gt;&gt; he was determined
[54:47] &gt;&gt; to go to Calvary, even though he knew
[54:52] what his punishment would be.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; That same kind of love
[55:00] &gt;&gt; and constraint
[55:04] &gt;&gt; was given to those early church
[55:06] believers.
[55:09] Remember in the age of Smyrna
[55:13] when they were persecuting the church,
[55:16] killing them,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; ripping the babies out of uh the
[55:20] mother's womb,
[55:24] &gt;&gt; burning them,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; crucifying them.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Feeding them to the lions.
[55:32] But because they love God so much
[55:36] &gt;&gt; and God loved them,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; God
[55:40] projected his grace,
[55:43] his sovereign grace. That's what I'm
[55:46] trying to tell you. If you love God and
[55:50] really love him, when you come to the
[55:53] end of all that you can do,
[55:58] God will project his grace.
[56:01] Hallelujah.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, he's a problem solver.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Is there anything too hard for God? Our
[56:14] problem is
[56:15] &gt;&gt; we don't love him like we say we do.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Because when you love somebody,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; you can't help but to talk about them.
[56:27] Y'all hear what I'm saying? When you
[56:29] love somebody,
[56:31] you want to communicate.
[56:33] You want to talk to them.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And sometime text messages
[56:40] &gt;&gt; just won't do.
[56:43] Hallelujah. Because you want to see
[56:46] their face.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; You're the only generation
[56:53] &gt;&gt; that God loves so much
[56:57] that God loved so much
[57:00] &gt;&gt; that he actually showed his face.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; He came down.
[57:10] [Laughter]
[57:13] for fellowship.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; He wasn't waiting for you to come up.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; He came down
[57:22] &gt;&gt; to fellowship with you.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And he's still here
[57:28] to fellowship with you.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; You think about it now.
[57:35] God chose Abraham
[57:39] &gt;&gt; and Abraham
[57:42] &gt;&gt; was the natural seed.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; And in the natural,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; the Bible said that Abraham
[57:50] never staggered at the promises of God.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And though
[57:58] his body was dead,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; he couldn't produce children.
[58:04] He called those things that be not
[58:08] &gt;&gt; as though they were.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We say that so often
[58:15] &gt;&gt; until it's almost a cliche.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Faith
[58:22] versus reasoning.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Remember I preached that last me last
[58:26] meeting.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Faith versus reasoning.
[58:30] Satan will always have you
[58:34] reasoning.
[58:36] Satan, I mean, Satan will always have
[58:39] you reasoning
[58:43] psychologically.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Is it logical?
[58:49] Is it logical?
[58:51] Nothing is logical with God.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Everything is by faith.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; You can't mathematically figure him out.
[59:03] It makes no sense.
[59:06] But that's how God works.
[59:09] God does not work by science.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; God works by faith.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Because he himself believes
[59:21] in his own word.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; You want to see something happen.
[59:28] You start praising God
[59:31] for the things you have not yet
[59:32] received,
[59:35] but you believe God and you know you're
[59:38] going to receive it.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Guarantee
[59:43] God will come on the scene.
[59:46] That's how it works.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham, where's the baby?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; but he's coming.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many years has been
[59:57] Abraham?
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; 21 years.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; 22 years.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; 23 years.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Yep. 24 years.
[1:00:09] 25.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Then the baby came.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; But Abraham never staggered.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; His confession
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; was that God promised it and God cannot
[1:00:24] lie.
[1:00:26] Hallelujah.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:00:31] our pastor uh last
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; was Sam was what's his name? Sam.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. He came and he gave us a beautiful
[1:00:44] message.
[1:00:46] But he also talk about
[1:00:49] that there's another page
[1:00:52] or another document.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; And and that's the way God always works
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; because we realize
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; that Daniel should have died.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; The whole world was against him
[1:01:09] except God.
[1:01:12] And the thing that Daniel had
[1:01:15] on his side
[1:01:17] is because he loved God
[1:01:21] no matter what the decision would have
[1:01:23] been.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; You understand me? If God wants me to
[1:01:27] die
[1:01:29] at the mouth of a lion, so let it be.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I have confidence
[1:01:37] that my God will not fail.
[1:01:40] I don't know how he's going to do it,
[1:01:43] but I know that I love him and he's
[1:01:46] proven his love to me.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me here because I'm going
[1:01:51] tell you something. If you really love
[1:01:54] God, he will prove his love to you.
[1:02:00] I'm not talking about saying it with
[1:02:02] your mouth
[1:02:05] in your heart.
[1:02:07] If you really love God,
[1:02:10] He will always show up.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Now what happened?
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; God
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; showed Nebuchadnezzar
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; who was really God,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; right? And he put out a decree.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; From this point on,
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; everybody must worship
[1:02:39] Daniel's God.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; And if you don't
[1:02:44] worship Daniel's God because he is God,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; you will be put to death.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; So, what are you saying? Tying it over
[1:02:55] into our message.
[1:02:58] Hallelujah. Cuz he paralleled Daniel
[1:03:01] with brother Brandon. Hallelujah. And if
[1:03:04] you don't believe Elijah's God,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; if you don't worship Elijah's God,
[1:03:12] you would be put to death.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But how
[1:03:20] do you worship
[1:03:22] Elijah's God?
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; The only way you cannot worship Elijah's
[1:03:28] God,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; you must worship him
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; in spirit. I'm going to say it again.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; In spirit
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and in truth.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't say truth
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; only. I said spirit
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; and truth.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; In other words, you got to have the Holy
[1:03:47] Ghost.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost Elijah had Elicia
[1:03:55] had it.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? And the truth.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. must understand
[1:04:04] something transpired
[1:04:07] in our day.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right? As I said,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; uh when it comes to the message,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; we're no longer just part of the seventh
[1:04:20] church age.
[1:04:22] But God has brought something down.
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; He brought the capstone down.
[1:04:30] He brought him. Hello.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Now you understand this.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; It was God who came down
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; call him the capstone.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; But he that's what Bible said that the
[1:04:43] same this the the the cornerstone
[1:04:47] which was Jesus Christ has now become
[1:04:50] the head
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; of the corner.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; So that you better understand what I'm
[1:04:57] saying.
[1:04:58] When we get to heaven,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; will be on the throne.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Not only him
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; in the throne room,
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; but his bride will be there.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Because he said, "If
[1:05:18] you overcome,
[1:05:20] I will allow you to sit in my throne
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; as I have sat in my father's throne."
[1:05:28] Understand what you're given.
[1:05:32] If you can see that you're giving
[1:05:34] something
[1:05:35] that you yourself could not have earned,
[1:05:39] hallelujah, it ought to make you happy.
[1:05:43] You don't have to work for it.
[1:05:46] You don't have to beg for it.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. You don't have to
[1:05:51] do nothing.
[1:05:53] Here is the works of God.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Believe on him
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; whom God has sent.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And in this last day, God sent Elijah.
[1:06:06] Oh, you say, "Brother Brooks, you mean
[1:06:09] to tell me in order for me to do the
[1:06:11] works of God, I must believe that
[1:06:14] William Brandham is the messenger of the
[1:06:16] hour."
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Absolutely.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when I say
[1:06:21] believe, I'm not talking with your head.
[1:06:25] I'm talking in your heart. Hallelujah.
[1:06:28] Hallelujah. And if you truly believe it,
[1:06:31] you will do as Jesus said. If you love
[1:06:35] me, you'll keep my commandments.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; One thing I'll say then,
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; you're captured.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; If if if you truly it are the seed of
[1:06:48] God.
[1:06:52] You couldn't get away if you tried.
[1:06:59] You understand me?
[1:07:02] I mean, he you you stick tighter than
[1:07:04] gorilla glue.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; You can't get away.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; You're trapped.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; You know, there really are some natural
[1:07:23] love affairs like that. There are some
[1:07:26] natural love affairs like that.
[1:07:30] you love your wife or you love your
[1:07:31] husband
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; and you don't even think about leaving
[1:07:35] it
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; and when you do
[1:07:39] you really figured out how much nonsense
[1:07:42] that is
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:07:46] you might say oh I can't live with him
[1:07:49] but you now have crossed that line
[1:07:52] I can't live without him
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; oh come on somebody I know y'all ain't
[1:07:58] that unhappy
[1:08:03] Oh my god. I'm 48 years uh in my
[1:08:06] marriage and I'm enjoying it. Do I have
[1:08:08] a hard time? Absolutely.
[1:08:13] But I never thought one time
[1:08:16] about divorcing my wife.
[1:08:19] Never.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And if I had ever thought it, I would
[1:08:27] tell you.
[1:08:28] But my life has never been that bad
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; where I want to break the vow of God.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Let me hold on. Let me move on cuz some
[1:08:40] of y'all getting there something
[1:08:42] happening here. I don't know what that
[1:08:43] is.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Stop that nonsense. If you thinking
[1:08:45] about divorce and forget it,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; you promise God you'll go through the
[1:08:50] bad and the good.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; I'm still looking for some mouse to
[1:08:57] move.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus
[1:09:06] defeated Satan by his word.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way you'll be able
[1:09:12] to defeat him.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; By his word.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; See, Satan will always attack you.
[1:09:23] those comments, that last comments
[1:09:24] really put a damp or something down up
[1:09:26] in here. So, somebody's going through
[1:09:28] something.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless,
[1:09:31] God just spoke to you.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; There is where Satan's
[1:09:37] attack is on the word.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; And as I said last week or the time I
[1:09:43] spoke last,
[1:09:46] you always have reason versus faith.
[1:09:51] You're going to reason it.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; You're going to think what I need to do
[1:09:55] is right.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; But I tell you like this,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; the only way to be a winner
[1:10:03] is to take God at his word.
[1:10:06] Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Understand
[1:10:09] your life is not a mistake.
[1:10:13] Everything that has happened to your
[1:10:15] life or in your life whether it's good
[1:10:19] or bad
[1:10:21] God ordained it.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why the Bible says in all
[1:10:28] things give thanks.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Listen, I refuse
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; to let anybody
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; control my joy.
[1:10:41] Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Yo, you you might be wrong,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; but but listen, you're not going to
[1:10:50] control my joy.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; If I won't let the devil do it,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let you do it.
[1:10:58] Oh, well, you hurt my feelings.
[1:11:01] Hurt my feelings.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Well, first of all, Lord, help me cuz
[1:11:06] I'm supposed to be dead anyhow.
[1:11:10] Amen.
[1:11:14] Right?
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, something might smack you,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; but you get over the pain.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You get over the pain
[1:11:26] and then you thank God for the pain.
[1:11:29] What do you mean, brother? Thank God for
[1:11:32] the pain.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; It's building character.
[1:11:37] Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; He knows how to try to kill that temple.
[1:11:44] Some of y'all have
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; I'm coming. Don't worry. I'm coming by
[1:11:53] the grace of God. Now, we understand
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; the altar of God. Remember before most
[1:12:01] of the time
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; when Israel will offer a unto the Lord a
[1:12:07] sacrifice,
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; it was it was always in a high place
[1:12:13] somewhere that it could be seen.
[1:12:18] Hallelujah. Now the heathens did the
[1:12:20] same thing.
[1:12:22] But whenever you offer a sacrifice,
[1:12:26] you want it to be seen
[1:12:29] by others
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; by others.
[1:12:34] Y'all understand me? When you say a
[1:12:36] praise,
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; you don't say, "Well, you know, I just
[1:12:41] praise the Lord."
[1:12:43] No.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; You want it to be seen.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. Cuz I know some of y'all think,
[1:12:49] "Well, they going to think I want to be
[1:12:51] something." No,
[1:12:53] they don't have to think that
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; because you are something.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; You are the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:13:02] and you need to praise your husband.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; You need to thank God
[1:13:10] for every moment of this time.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you realize no
[1:13:17] matter what I go through here,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; I have a home beyond the river.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Now, you don't may not understand this.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; But this life is going to make you enjoy
[1:13:33] that life
[1:13:36] in a better way.
[1:13:40] That's right.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me say it like this. Do
[1:13:46] you think that thief
[1:13:48] on the cross
[1:13:52] wasn't happy
[1:13:55] when he died?
[1:13:58] He didn't go to hell,
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; but he found himself in paradise.
[1:14:04] Think about it. All he had stolen
[1:14:09] and may have killed a few people
[1:14:12] was totally erased.
[1:14:16] And now he was sitting in paradise.
[1:14:20] He didn't have to pay anything to get
[1:14:23] there.
[1:14:24] Y'all don't understand me
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; because here it was.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; I'm almost jumping here and I'm trying
[1:14:30] not to.
[1:14:32] But but understand when Jesus Christ
[1:14:35] came
[1:14:38] let's let's let's use John
[1:14:41] when John saw Jesus
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; John says listen this is the one
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; that has been preferred
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; before me.
[1:14:55] John said, "I'm not even worthy
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; to unloose the lashes of his shoes."
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said that the law
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; from Moses
[1:15:12] was given
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; and that law extended all the way up to
[1:15:16] John.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; All the way up to that time.
[1:15:25] Everybody was being judged by the law.
[1:15:29] And the Bible tells us that the law
[1:15:32] can't give you life.
[1:15:35] Because if the law could have given you
[1:15:37] life,
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; we would not have needed grace.
[1:15:42] Hallelujah.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; And here is Jesus.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Coming in
[1:15:48] changing the time,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; changing the season.
[1:15:54] Hallelujah. And changing the
[1:15:56] administration
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; of God
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; from law to grace.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; So you got to understand
[1:16:09] Jesus ministry
[1:16:12] could never be understood.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; By the sinner
[1:16:18] nor the religious people.
[1:16:22] Because in the religious sect,
[1:16:25] they still were living by the law.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Think about it. The woman caught in
[1:16:33] adultery,
[1:16:36] it was the law that said she should be
[1:16:39] put to death.
[1:16:42] But Bible tells me that Jesus came with
[1:16:45] grace and truth.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] I love this. And and guess what?
[1:16:54] The law challenged the word.
[1:16:58] They challenged they challenged Jesus.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they were breaking the
[1:17:05] word
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; and tried to challenge the word. Because
[1:17:10] they were supposed to bring male and
[1:17:11] female.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:17:16] The law condemned.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; She should have died.
[1:17:21] Hallelujah.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Did Daniel break the law?
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; He broke the law. He should have died.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; The grace was administered.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who administered the grace?
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't the king.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; It was out of the king's control.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the fourth man in the
[1:17:46] fight.
[1:17:48] And that same God that was in the fire
[1:17:52] with the Hebrew voice was the same God
[1:17:56] in the lion's den. Y'all hear what I'm
[1:17:59] saying? When law should condemn all of
[1:18:02] us.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Grace steps in.
[1:18:07] This is what you got to understand.
[1:18:09] There was no perfection
[1:18:13] of the church ages.
[1:18:15] Hallelujah. because they did not have
[1:18:17] the perfect one.
[1:18:20] But my God, your God, Elijah's God,
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; came down,
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, as the headstone as a mighty
[1:18:31] angel. Revelation 10, he came down. And
[1:18:35] when he came down, he came down with
[1:18:38] grace.
[1:18:40] Hallelujah. He said grace and we
[1:18:43] responded with grace. Hallelujah.
[1:18:46] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. It's
[1:18:49] amazing grace that you and I could live
[1:18:53] in such a wicked age.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But guess what God said for
[1:18:59] this generation?
[1:19:01] Where are your accusers?
[1:19:04] I've been caught.
[1:19:06] I've been caught. I've been caught.
[1:19:10] I'm a sinner. Save by grace.
[1:19:15] Save by grace.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; And guess what he said?
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Let him,
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; let him
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; who is without sin,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; let him cast the first stone.
[1:19:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me say it to
[1:19:28] you. Cast the first stone. Oh, but the
[1:19:32] brother did this and the sister did
[1:19:34] this. Hallelujah. How
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; can you lay any charge to God's elect?
[1:19:42] Hallelujah. It is God who justifies.
[1:19:46] See, y'all get quiet now because you
[1:19:48] want to lay some kind of child on the
[1:19:51] elect of God when you cannot. It is God
[1:19:55] who justifies.
[1:19:57] Y'all better hear me. It's God. I don't
[1:20:01] care whether it be man or woman. If they
[1:20:04] have a power to repent
[1:20:07] and ask for forgiveness,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; you can't do a thing.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; You can't do a thing.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; But except
[1:20:17] the Bible says
[1:20:19] if you can't forgive your brother,
[1:20:22] then God can't forgive you.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Now, what you going to do with that?
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, you and I must
[1:20:31] understand
[1:20:32] we must hold the righteous condition
[1:20:36] in order to for a bride to be produced.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; You understand me?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's when you
[1:20:46] come to recognize
[1:20:48] that you love God
[1:20:52] no matter what,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; then God can give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:00] I'm going to love God more than I love
[1:21:01] my my wife, my mama, my daddy.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't nobody
[1:21:08] going to stop me from loving God.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, it's the truth.
[1:21:15] If they want to leave me, leave me
[1:21:19] because I'm never alone.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; He said, I'll always be with you.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, God. Is that right? I
[1:21:27] don't have to worry
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; about my Lord betraying me.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me here. But I know
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; that I stay faithful
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; unto him.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Even when I won't
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; be faithful,
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; he'll be faithful to me.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet says.
[1:21:57] God only provided place of worship.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now think
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; these men
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; when was was they called and was put
[1:22:10] into this condition.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; These Pharisees
[1:22:16] so y'all understand me.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; They've got to be Pharisees.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; They have to be there. There have to be
[1:22:25] Sadducees.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; There have to be three kinds of
[1:22:29] believers always
[1:22:32] in order for God to fulfill his word.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Now it goes on says
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; and look what he says.
[1:22:42] But Jesus said in vain you worship me.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Worship him genuine worship.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; True worship from their hearts.
[1:22:55] In vain you worship me
[1:22:59] teaching the doctrine. There are
[1:23:01] traditions of man.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; You see one time that worked.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Lutheran doctrine worked
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; at one time. The Methodist doctrine
[1:23:16] worked
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; at one time.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Pentecostal doctrine
[1:23:22] worked.
[1:23:25] But when God began to do another
[1:23:27] administration,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, brother, I don't know
[1:23:33] what you're talking about."
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; To prove my point,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; I think it's in 1957.
[1:23:40] When America was weighed in the balance,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; hallelujah and nobody wanted to repent.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; The gospel was being preached
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; by Billy Graham,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Billy,
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; by or Roberts
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; and by William Brham.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; And there were missionaries
[1:24:01] traveling all over the world.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; But here in America,
[1:24:06] we turn the gospel down.
[1:24:10] Hallelujah.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Baptist,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Methodist, you name them,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; they all turned it down.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Now they worship
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; in vain.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Sincerely
[1:24:25] worshiping in vain
[1:24:27] and only those
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; who moves with the pillar of fire
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; will be accepted.
[1:24:35] Amen.
[1:24:38] for a rapture. Y'all understand what I'm
[1:24:40] saying?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; So, we we see these things.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Let me see finish. He said, "If I taught
[1:24:54] you a Methodist message,
[1:24:57] it would take no effect on you.
[1:25:00] This is bride time.
[1:25:03] If Moses taught the message of Noah,
[1:25:07] it would take no effect,
[1:25:10] if Jesus taught the message of Moses,
[1:25:14] it would take no effect
[1:25:16] because the the predestinated seed
[1:25:20] are laying there that will only be
[1:25:23] watered
[1:25:25] by that type of water
[1:25:29] that gives for that seed.
[1:25:33] See, it won't grow any other condition.
[1:25:37] It must be the condition that it grows
[1:25:39] in.
[1:25:42] So you understand, you can sit in any
[1:25:45] kind of church you want to.
[1:25:47] But only the message can make you grow.
[1:25:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It is the only
[1:25:53] thing that satisfies
[1:25:55] the true seed of God.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, that's what John said. John
[1:26:02] said, "For the law was given by Moses,
[1:26:05] but grace and truth came by Jesus
[1:26:09] Christ."
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; So that you can understand this message
[1:26:14] is grace.
[1:26:16] This message is truth. It's not law.
[1:26:20] It's not dogma. Hallelujah. I do what I
[1:26:24] do because I love him. And he said, "If
[1:26:28] you love me, you'll keep my
[1:26:31] commandments."
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right?
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; That's why they couldn't understand
[1:26:36] Jesus.
[1:26:38] You mean to tell me you're going to heal
[1:26:41] on the Sabbath day?
[1:26:44] Can you imagine if you were sick and you
[1:26:48] got to wait another day
[1:26:51] in order to get well
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; because you're not allowed to pray on
[1:26:56] the Sabbath day.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus turned around and he said, "I'm
[1:27:02] the Lord of the Sabbath."
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Because Sabbath is another word for
[1:27:09] rest.
[1:27:11] Come unto me all ye that are later and
[1:27:15] heavy later and I will give you rest.
[1:27:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What we failed
[1:27:21] to see is why God saved us.
[1:27:26] Hallelujah. In this day,
[1:27:29] let's go to the parable.
[1:27:31] They're calling people.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; The domination wouldn't come to the
[1:27:36] wedding.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:39] Nobody would come.
[1:27:42] The report got back to God. Is that
[1:27:45] right?
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right? All of them were called
[1:27:50] every church age. Even up to the
[1:27:52] Pentecostals,
[1:27:54] they were called to the wedding, but
[1:27:56] they were what? Too busy.
[1:27:59] Too busy. Too much property. Too much
[1:28:01] land. Too much this, that, and the
[1:28:03] other. Hallelujah. Then God said,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; "Go to the highways.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Go to the hedges.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Go to those who are nobodies.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Call them.
[1:28:17] Bring them
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; because I want my house full.
[1:28:21] That's the ministry of the bride.
[1:28:24] Y'all better hear me. There are people
[1:28:27] out on the streets
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; cast away
[1:28:33] poor among us fed up with church but
[1:28:37] they want to see Jesus.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Somebody help. Oh, you don't want to go
[1:28:41] there. But I got a quote for you so you
[1:28:44] understand. It's not my thoughts. These
[1:28:47] are not my thoughts. Brother Bradam said
[1:28:50] before the wedding could take place.
[1:28:54] We must do our job. And he says, "Amen."
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; We must have the ability
[1:29:02] of laying hands or healing the sick. I
[1:29:04] get it. I'll come to it in just a
[1:29:06] moment. Hallelujah. But how are we going
[1:29:09] to get there?
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He preached a message.
[1:29:15] El Shai,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; which means the breasted one, which
[1:29:20] means the strength giver. Hallelujah.
[1:29:23] And then the reason why we're so weak in
[1:29:26] faith
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; because we have not been nursing
[1:29:30] the breast of you.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the last time you
[1:29:36] listened to a tape,
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the last time you
[1:29:42] stayed on your knees and prayed till you
[1:29:44] felt God come through. Hallelujah. But
[1:29:48] that's where your strength is. You're
[1:29:50] going to always be a weak Christian
[1:29:54] as long as you don't play the game.
[1:29:57] You come to church and hear the word.
[1:30:01] You don't come to church
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; to examine brother Brooks. I wonder if
[1:30:06] he's going to preach the right thing.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me ask you a question.
[1:30:11] Why do you believe that what you believe
[1:30:12] is right?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:18] It's only the word.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, wait a minute. What are
[1:30:26] you saying, brother?
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; The woman at Simon's house,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; I'm using the woman because she
[1:30:33] represents the church.
[1:30:35] The woman at Simon's house.
[1:30:37] I I love this. I was going to preach on
[1:30:40] the alabaster box and hadn't gotten
[1:30:42] there yet. But my point is
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; this lady
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; who was a known illame woman
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; what we call today a prostitute.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how she made her
[1:30:57] money.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But she heard
[1:31:01] perhaps that this woman
[1:31:04] caught in adultery
[1:31:06] was forgiven by Jesus.
[1:31:08] Y'all hear? You know how testimonies?
[1:31:11] He said testimonies are are not
[1:31:13] important. Yes, they are.
[1:31:15] Queen of Sheba said, "I heard."
[1:31:19] Queen of Sheba said, "I heard
[1:31:22] about your church services."
[1:31:25] Hallelujah. I heard
[1:31:28] and I have come to see if what I heard
[1:31:31] is real.
[1:31:33] Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[1:31:35] If we could go out and testify
[1:31:38] that Jesus is the same yesterday, today,
[1:31:40] and forever,
[1:31:42] and God is doing the miraculous here,
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; because that's what he wants to do.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; He's not calling you to sit up here and
[1:31:51] just eat lunch and be fat.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's fueling you.
[1:31:58] He's giving you energy
[1:32:00] so you can get out there and testify.
[1:32:04] But if God hadn't done for nothing for
[1:32:06] you in a long time,
[1:32:08] you're all dried up.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Dried up and prickly
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; like a sticker.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hadn't had rain in your life
[1:32:19] in a long time.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; People can't even talk to your mouth
[1:32:25] because you snappy snappy. Hallelujah.
[1:32:28] You need some rain.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; You need some water.
[1:32:32] You need an experience.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; You need a refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; We've got to fight for this thing.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Judah
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; one.
[1:32:50] Jude second chapter.
[1:32:57] I just want to see if somebody will turn
[1:32:59] the pages or not.
[1:33:02] There's only one book of Jude one.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Beloved,
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; third verse.
[1:33:14] When I gave all diligence
[1:33:17] to write unto you the common salvation,
[1:33:21] it was needful for me to write unto you,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; and exalt you,
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; that ye should earnestly
[1:33:31] contend for the faith which was once
[1:33:34] delivered unto the saint.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; You know what that word contend means?
[1:33:42] Uh
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; it means to fight
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; fight.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; You have to fight to keep it. You know,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; you have to fight to keep your joy.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Fight to keep your peace.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; You have to fight to keep sanctified.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; It's a battle.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Like I said, but it's a battle between
[1:34:09] reasoning and faith.
[1:34:12] Hallelujah.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; For there are certain men
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; crept in unawares
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; who were before of old
[1:34:20] ordained to this condemnation,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; ungodly men.
[1:34:27] You mean in the church? In the church,
[1:34:30] people are ordained to be devils
[1:34:33] in the church. That's why you can't look
[1:34:36] at everybody
[1:34:38] and you can't say, "Well, so and so
[1:34:39] ain't doing it. Why should I do it?
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care what so and so ain't doing.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; What that got to do with me? What does
[1:34:48] that have to do with you?
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, you live it.
[1:34:55] You don't know who so and so is, but you
[1:34:58] better know who you are.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; You know what what they used to say? I
[1:35:04] can't go up there. I can't go to that
[1:35:07] church.
[1:35:08] All they got up there is hypocrites,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Well, if you come up in here
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; with that kind of attitude,
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; you make one more hypocrite,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Look, let let's move on.
[1:35:27] turning the grace of God into
[1:35:30] lasciviousness
[1:35:34] and denying the Lord, the only Lord God.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; You say, how do they turn the grace of
[1:35:41] God into lasciviousness
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; by telling the people
[1:35:48] it doesn't matter what you wear.
[1:35:53] And then people come to church,
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; shorts,
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; tights,
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; skirts and dresses above their knees,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; sexual
[1:36:05] provoking clothing.
[1:36:08] And these salt called Christians
[1:36:11] are walking in the spirit of
[1:36:13] lasciviousness,
[1:36:15] lust,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; it makes a difference.
[1:36:21] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Have you ever gone to a church
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; and you got to turn your head,
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; brothers,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; in church?
[1:36:39] You say, "Well, I'm in the message in
[1:36:41] church."
[1:36:44] Cuz y'all know sometime them dresses so
[1:36:48] tight.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad somebody said that's right.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; The sisters ain't going to say it.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; But it's true.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, brothers. Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Those of you who are red-blooded,
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; how can you not look?
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Well, it your your eyes you're designed
[1:37:20] that way.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; I ain't gonna go too deep, but it's the
[1:37:29] true,
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; you know, and and I'll be honest with
[1:37:33] you, there are times I had to go. I had
[1:37:35] to leave.
[1:37:39] Y'all say brother Brooks leaving his
[1:37:41] wedding early. Yes, I'm leaving.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about people in the
[1:37:48] wedding. I'm talking about people that
[1:37:49] comes.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; But let me stop because I'm gonna make
[1:37:52] somebody upset. But the truth of the
[1:37:54] matter is
[1:37:56] it's so tight.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; I just wonder how they got in it.
[1:38:03] How can they breathe?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Your whole dress is a girdle.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Let me move on. But that's the
[1:38:19] seriousness.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; And if I don't preach on that, God will
[1:38:25] judge me.
[1:38:28] That's right.
[1:38:30] I see it.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; And my point is I'm a shepherd.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; I have to call things out. Oh, people
[1:38:37] say,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; "But is grace, brother Bruce."
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; But your dress,
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; come on, brothers. Sometime y'all have
[1:38:47] it too tight.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Them pants so tight.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[1:39:00] That ain't right either.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm talking to somebody
[1:39:05] this morning.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; But my point is, I can't allow that kind
[1:39:11] of a thing to creep.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; I have to preach it. Whether you like it
[1:39:17] or not, I don't care about tradition. I
[1:39:20] care about the word.
[1:39:23] Hallelujah. Why? Because when I allow us
[1:39:26] to do that, then I am denying what the
[1:39:29] word says.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We must work. We must dress
[1:39:34] godly.
[1:39:37] Think about it. If you can't wear your
[1:39:39] dress
[1:39:40] in heaven, you not you don't need to
[1:39:43] wear it on her earth.
[1:39:46] Same with the brothers.
[1:39:48] I know brother Brandham said when he saw
[1:39:50] the bride, she had loose garments on.
[1:39:54] loose
[1:39:57] flowing.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Let me move on cuz I didn't mean to go
[1:40:05] there,
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; but God is speaking.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; So, understand this.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; You can't just dress any kind of way.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord knows my heart
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; and I know your heart, too.
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:27] You know, we called a cult. Did y'all
[1:40:29] know that?
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; People call us a cult.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Because our women dress like women.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; And our brothers dress like brothers.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Our women still wear dresses.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't nobody making you do it.
[1:40:52] You're doing it because the Holy Spirit
[1:40:54] is leading you to do it.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; If a sister got dressed right, if she
[1:41:03] doesn't have the Holy Ghost,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; she got two wardrobes.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; She got a wardrobe she wear at home
[1:41:14] and a wardrobe she wear to church.
[1:41:18] As if God don't see you.
[1:41:22] Amen.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I'm telling y'all. See, see, I can tell
[1:41:26] I'm right cuz y'all sister smiling.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Y'all know it's right.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; But that's wrong.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Let me move on.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me I have to say it.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; I was telling a brother the other day
[1:41:40] about brothers wearing shorts.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, look at that.
[1:41:52] And the one brother said, "Oh, I didn't
[1:41:53] know that. I didn't know. I was supposed
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yeah, brother Brandon said,
[1:41:59] "Brothers, don't wear shorts cuz that's
[1:42:01] women underwear."
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The man who wears shorts,
[1:42:08] it belongs to the big society.
[1:42:11] [Music]
[1:42:19] And I told him, I said, "Brother, let me
[1:42:20] tell you something.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; You don't need a doctrine to tell you
[1:42:24] that.
[1:42:26] When I got the Holy Ghost, I was a
[1:42:29] swimmer. I love to swim."
[1:42:33] After I got the Holy Ghost, I went to
[1:42:36] the swimming pool. I walked
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden a wind came from
[1:42:42] somewhere,
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; blew across me.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; I looked down and something said naked.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; I ran home
[1:42:53] in my nakedness.
[1:42:56] See, God showed me it was wrong. That's
[1:42:59] why I can't understand. If God showed me
[1:43:01] that, why isn't he showing you all that?
[1:43:06] I was in a Pentecostal church then.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not message.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Y'all, oh Lord have mercy.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; God will fix it for you.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; You have to fight.
[1:43:24] Contend for the faith.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; And I told that brother one thing. I
[1:43:28] said, "Listen, I'm off my notes now. I'm
[1:43:31] off my notes."
[1:43:32] But I said when I go swimming, it's been
[1:43:34] a long time.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; I said every time I've gone to the beach
[1:43:37] or wherever I would go,
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; I said I make sure I have everything.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; I look like a scuba diver.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I have on my long sleeve or whatever. I
[1:43:49] have my pants
[1:43:51] all the way down to my ankles.
[1:43:56] God is my witness.
[1:43:58] Everything get wet.
[1:44:04] You say you're going to look strange in
[1:44:05] the eyes of the people. I want them to
[1:44:07] know I'm strange.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; I'm just Let's Let's Y'all okay with
[1:44:13] that?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; We got a few more minutes. I know y'all.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm talking as a father, as a
[1:44:21] friend, and as a pastor.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; We don't make you do anything around
[1:44:26] here.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Is whatever you choose to do.
[1:44:30] But it's it's my duty to bring the
[1:44:32] knowledge to you.
[1:44:35] Now that you have the knowledge,
[1:44:37] it's your duty to seek God whether the
[1:44:40] knowledge that I just gave you is true.
[1:44:44] Hallelujah.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; So that you understand and I'm getting
[1:44:48] ready to close on this.
[1:44:51] The message
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; cuz there's no way I can finish. The
[1:44:54] message of the hour
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; has encaged me
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; by his love.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And every believer is engaged.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; But in this generation,
[1:45:11] we're not building a house.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; God is. Amen.
[1:45:20] We don't have to build a temple
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; because we are the temple
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; and we are different
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; from all of the ages.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; This is why the word of God say they
[1:45:36] cannot be complete
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; without us
[1:45:42] cuz we take on the headstone.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:47] and understand by the grace of God,
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that what God is trying to
[1:45:54] do with us,
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; he's going to do it.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the work that he's done,
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; he shall complete it.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Good to see you, Sister Joselyn.
[1:46:11] So we realize
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; by God's grace
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; I said that to you because I always miss
[1:46:18] you when you leave. I don't get a chance
[1:46:20] to talk to you.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is that okay?
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:46:32] Don't mean to embarrass you, but you
[1:46:34] know I I I do miss everybody that's not
[1:46:36] when you miss it. You miss you miss.
[1:46:39] But but my po my point is
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; you and I are special like brother
[1:46:45] saying a special class of people.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe that?
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And if you can continue to
[1:46:56] believe that
[1:46:58] you re you'll come to the place, okay,
[1:47:01] I've done wrong. I've done wrong here.
[1:47:04] I've done wrong here. But there's still
[1:47:06] something in my heart
[1:47:09] that wants to please God.
[1:47:13] And as long as that's in your heart,
[1:47:16] God still can deal with you.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; And not only that,
[1:47:22] but God will
[1:47:25] deal with you.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As I said,
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; El Shadi,
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; El Shai,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; it is the uh worker with the uh breasted
[1:47:34] one.
[1:47:36] He is to give you strength every day.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In other words, we don't
[1:47:42] look to the pastor.
[1:47:45] Oh. Oh. This is not a man age.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; This is the Holy Spirit age.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is the one that we
[1:47:53] supposed to be drawing from.
[1:47:57] I heard brother Bam said it like this.
[1:48:00] He said, "When you pull on on El Shad,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; the breasted one, he's working with
[1:48:04] God."
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then God
[1:48:08] pours his strength
[1:48:11] into you, the believer."
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; So what are you saying? If you're going
[1:48:18] through something,
[1:48:20] you have to say, "Lord,
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; I am weak,
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; but thou art strong."
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I need you
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; to strengthen me.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give me a word of
[1:48:34] encouragement. Show me a scripture. Let
[1:48:38] me listen to a message. Whatever it is,
[1:48:41] Lord, I come to you because you are the
[1:48:45] strong tower. And the Bible said the
[1:48:47] righteous run at their end and they are
[1:48:52] safe.
[1:48:54] What you don't understand is
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; perhaps you do. I don't know.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; But you are the completion.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; You are the completion
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; of God's body.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; What you talking about, brothers?
[1:49:15] Jesus Christ
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; is the male
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; and the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; is the female.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he can't even be complete
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; to every member of his bride
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; is complete.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And he's building you,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; directing you, instructing you.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; He picks you up when you fall.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He heals you when you're
[1:49:49] sick.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He becomes your friend,
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; when you have no other. Hallelujah.
[1:49:56] Y'all understand me?
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; So, he's always there. How many of y'all
[1:50:00] believe that he's even there? Like that
[1:50:03] song say, like the song say, even when I
[1:50:07] don't know it, he's always working.
[1:50:10] When I don't feel him, he's working.
[1:50:14] When I don't see him, he's working. He's
[1:50:18] always working.
[1:50:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To bring you to
[1:50:22] perfection. to bring me to perfection.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Potentially, we already have it.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God want to see
[1:50:31] manifestation.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Coming from the message marriage and
[1:50:37] divorce.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 241.
[1:50:41] He said at the at that end there will be
[1:50:44] one Lord Jesus
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; and his bride,
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; many singular.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; There was one David on the throne,
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; one king
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; after God's own heart
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; with 500 wives.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus sitting on his throne. Hallelujah.
[1:51:10] in the millennium
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; with a wife
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; like it was at the beginning
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; created out of the earth
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; by the hand of the almighty God
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; in the resurrection
[1:51:25] many members there you are
[1:51:31] hallelujah woman
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; struggle to be that
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; come into Christ
[1:51:39] when you're not be in the filthy mess
[1:51:41] out there,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; then you you not be in the filthy mess
[1:51:47] out there.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; But long as you're just a church member
[1:51:55] trying to live moral and good yourself,
[1:51:59] you'll never make it.
[1:52:02] Neither can a man make it outside of
[1:52:04] Christ.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:08] As Paul went on to say,
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; but there in Christ,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, there is neither male nor
[1:52:16] female,
[1:52:18] they're all one.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Right? So when Christ come into you, you
[1:52:25] become one with him.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, you may have been the the weaker
[1:52:30] vessel,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; but because you come into him,
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; you have his power.
[1:52:37] You have his strength,
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; you have his faith,
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; everything Jesus got.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; When you join
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; in that invisible union, you become one.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:54] The power of creation is in you.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; I'm almost done.
[1:52:59] So I want you to understand,
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; you can't look at America
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; and expect America to have a great
[1:53:06] revival.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; No, the revival is in you.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; They their days is over.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be this great I
[1:53:17] know what it looks like.
[1:53:20] It looks like the American getting ready
[1:53:21] to have a revival.
[1:53:26] But brother Brandham said,
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; "When all those denominations
[1:53:30] get together like that,
[1:53:32] it would only lead them to the mark of
[1:53:34] the beast."
[1:53:39] So all these people, listen, look how
[1:53:41] they can talk about Jesus better than
[1:53:43] you,
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; right? I I said, "Lord, what is this?"
[1:53:49] Half naked and everything and praising
[1:53:51] God.
[1:53:54] Hallelujah. I've seen him at the
[1:53:56] restaurants,
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Bible open,
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Bible studying,
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; and a beer.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Huh? You say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; They say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[1:54:19] And they say they're the church,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; but they are,
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; but we're the bride.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; We have a difference.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; We're not worried about being saved.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; We're saved.
[1:54:35] But the point is, we want to make a
[1:54:37] rapture. We want to be bride. And the
[1:54:41] only way that you can be bride is that
[1:54:44] you receive his Holy Ghost.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on, one more. One more.
[1:54:49] Let me let me let me let me read this
[1:54:51] for you.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; In the message El Shadi,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; every preparation is made.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Healing is already tone atoned for.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Sins are already atoned for.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; All things are ready.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what he said? All things
[1:55:13] are ready.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Everything Jesus did made all things
[1:55:16] ready.
[1:55:18] He said, "Come." That's right.
[1:55:20] The wedding supper is set.
[1:55:24] Excuses are made.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go in."
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; The last call was,
[1:55:31] "Go get the sick and the
[1:55:36] last call, a campaign of healing just
[1:55:39] before the wedding supper."
[1:55:42] Now, you can say, "Well, Brother Brooks,
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; that happened with Brother Bam."
[1:55:46] And it did,
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't supposed to stop.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Did not Elisha or Elisha
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; do miracles after Elijah was gone?
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And now you see where we at. Go get the
[1:56:05] lane,
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; the halt,
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; the blind out of the street,
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; highways,
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; hedges,
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; hedges, and bring them in.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Heal them,
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; and let me show my mercy to them.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Then they'll they'll they'll believe me.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's God's last call.
[1:56:34] supper call
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; is healing.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; The last call.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, brother."
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Well, then that's why the Bible
[1:56:44] according to Revelation
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; said the spirit and the bride come.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; You can't get away with it. You can't
[1:56:53] get out of it. The supernatural is
[1:56:56] supposed to be among us. Not with the
[1:56:59] preacher, the pastor only,
[1:57:01] the body of Christ.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; In my last quote,
[1:57:09] he said that's the truth.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; America has all has absolutely sinned
[1:57:15] away of grace.
[1:57:20] You mark it down on a book.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; You'll never have a universal revival in
[1:57:25] America.
[1:57:28] We passed that about three years ago.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; I'll never it'll never be a revival.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Some of you young people mark down my
[1:57:40] word.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Not word down for that.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; There'll never be a nationwide
[1:57:48] revival.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; No more
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; like the Billy Sundays.
[1:57:54] Billy Sunday. You'll have little spurts
[1:57:56] up like that till Jesus come.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; But it'll never be.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; God has turned from it
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; and gone to the foreign nations.
[1:58:11] That's where the people come.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; One sign from the Lord done.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Thousands
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; run to the altar
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; of heathens.
[1:58:27] And it could be done over and over to
[1:58:29] the bunch of Americans
[1:58:32] that's been taught this way. So let me
[1:58:35] say it like this
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; just to bring it to your attention.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; And if that be the case,
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; where do you fit?
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you.
[1:58:50] Brother told his wife,
[1:58:54] We're not Americans.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; We're pilgrim and strangers.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; We only belong to one land
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; and that's the land of promise.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you see
[1:59:15] how come no you can witness to people
[1:59:20] show them the truth.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; I tried to show a brother a friend of
[1:59:24] mine yesterday
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; and you know gave him a church age book
[1:59:31] all of that
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; and we went back after I left him.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Let me put it this way. He rejected
[1:59:41] again.
[1:59:43] But this man,
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; he could go out to malls and place
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; dressed like Superman,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Spider-Man,
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Spider-Man.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Witnessing people, witnesses to people
[1:59:56] about Jesus,
[2:00:00] you get him in a restaurant,
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; he'll out talk you
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; and he's talking about Jesus.
[2:00:09] And I'm like, Lord, what is this?
[2:00:14] What kind of zeal is that?
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; See, but when you're not required to do
[2:00:18] nothing,
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; you can be as happy as you want to be.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm trying to say?
[2:00:26] They will always outshine you.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; They got better choirs,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; better musician,
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; better singers.
[2:00:36] But man, you get the preacher
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; with a little bit of organ behind it.
[2:00:42] You got something.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; But none of that means anything to God.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Even in Esther day.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Esther didn't dress fancy.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; She dressed simple.
[2:01:01] But all the other churches,
[2:01:04] all the other women,
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; they had on all their jewelry.
[2:01:08] They thought that was going to impress
[2:01:10] the king.
[2:01:11] But they failed to forget. They failed
[2:01:13] to re realize.
[2:01:15] It was the king who gave them the
[2:01:17] jewelry.
[2:01:20] Remember this.
[2:01:22] In the name of Jesus,
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; there's Jehovah Gyra. Jehovah. Amen.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; The Lord will provide.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; And he's still the same.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Right. Abraham trusted him though.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Without faith, it's impossible to please
[2:01:47] God.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Y'all look, I'm telling y'all, you you
[2:01:52] may not hear what I'm saying now, but
[2:01:54] you going to need this.
[2:01:56] Things are not going to get better.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; That's why I try to tell people, you
[2:02:02] better enjoy your burgers. Enjoy your
[2:02:04] steaks now.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz when time get hard, at least you
[2:02:08] have memory.
[2:02:13] Enjoy your life. This is what Satan is
[2:02:16] trying to do to you. Cut your life. Take
[2:02:20] away your joy. Take away your peace. And
[2:02:23] to be honest with you, we could all be
[2:02:26] justified.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; But the point is, how many of us you can
[2:02:31] do like Job?
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away,
[2:02:36] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:02:38] Hallelujah. Though he slay me, yet I
[2:02:42] trust him. Hallelujah. No matter what I
[2:02:45] go through, I am in love with him
[2:02:50] and I trust him.
[2:02:53] And I know that no matter what I go
[2:02:55] through,
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; it's for my good.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Be in love with him.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Ask God to increase your love for him.
[2:03:06] Hallelujah.
[2:03:08] But in order to love him more,
[2:03:11] you got to get rid of your idols.
[2:03:14] And I don't know what they are, but you
[2:03:16] know the thing that takes more of your
[2:03:18] time
[2:03:20] than reading the Bible or listening to a
[2:03:23] message.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:03:30] [Applause]
[2:03:39] You know, I can't
[2:03:42] I can I I can how can I say it so you
[2:03:46] understand the Bible said judgment
[2:03:48] begins at the house of God. That
[2:03:50] scripture has never changed.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; It has and it never will.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon even said if a man don't
[2:04:01] preach a closline gospel,
[2:04:05] He hasn't even preached the gospel.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; A closed line.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I I say it in in love.
[2:04:26] I am so glad I wasn't raised up in this
[2:04:28] message.
[2:04:34] Because I find out that so many people
[2:04:36] raised up in this message
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; have a hard time receiving the Holy
[2:04:41] Ghost.
[2:04:51] know how to repent.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; And only God can give you a revelation
[2:04:56] of that.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; But I know what I used to be
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; and I know how far God has brought me.
[2:05:08] And even though
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; I might bear scars,
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; but the scars
[2:05:19] do not describe who I am now.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; You understand me?
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; What I used to be,
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; I am no longer.
[2:05:33] You know, it's like a man who
[2:05:36] was an alcoholic or a woman.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Alcohol burns
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; their lips
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; and so they have like a two-tone. Don't
[2:05:48] be looking at nobody lips
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; because I know that certain things will
[2:05:58] change.
[2:06:00] But
[2:06:01] but because a person still have that
[2:06:03] discoloration
[2:06:07] doesn't mean that still drinking.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[2:06:18] Let me say it like let me say it in a
[2:06:20] plain way.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; When I was in Lima,
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; there was a man. He's now close to a
[2:06:30] hundred.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; He's lived that long.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; But in his lifetime,
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; uh he was a man who liked men.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Men who like men
[2:06:45] and he always had that little thing
[2:06:47] about him.
[2:06:50] But that man repented.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; He married a wonderful woman.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; He has children. He has grandchildren.
[2:07:01] And many people would look at him
[2:07:04] as though he was the same.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; But he was a man
[2:07:10] I never had to worry about.
[2:07:13] He lived it.
[2:07:16] You understand me? He lived it. He lived
[2:07:20] the life. God changed him.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; So nobody can't tell me what God can.
[2:07:28] Hallelujah.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; If you were born with a wilted hand,
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; God can straighten it out.
[2:07:38] But some people believe, well, I've been
[2:07:40] like this all my life. And that might be
[2:07:43] true.
[2:07:44] But God come to change that life.
[2:07:48] God comes to to fix that.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; And I know for a for a fact that the
[2:07:54] message that we preach
[2:07:57] The gospel of Jesus Christ that we
[2:07:58] preach,
[2:08:00] which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:08:02] and today forever.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; He's still a creator.
[2:08:07] He's still a restorer.
[2:08:10] Hallelujah.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; And it's so true. You never judge a book
[2:08:16] by the covering.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Every one of us have
[2:08:21] come through bad stuff.
[2:08:24] There are things that we would never
[2:08:26] want to tell nobody.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God still had mercy.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; His love for you was projected and he
[2:08:35] gave you grace.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what we need to learn
[2:08:40] how to do is give our fellow man grace
[2:08:45] or our sister grace.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't scone nobody for
[2:08:53] something
[2:08:54] if you've never been there yourself.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know how people say, "Oh yeah,
[2:09:02] you smoke them cigarettes, man. You
[2:09:04] ought to quit.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; It ain't always easy like that.
[2:09:13] Why don't you go pray with that person?"
[2:09:18] But you know what we'll do? We'll
[2:09:20] gossip.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; That ain't helping nothing.
[2:09:25] A Christian, when you see your brother
[2:09:27] or your sister overtaken with a fault,
[2:09:30] what's the Bible say? You go to that
[2:09:33] person in meekness
[2:09:37] and help that person be restored.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; That's what love does.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; That's what love did for you.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; He saw you in every one of us.
[2:09:50] in the eyes of God,
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; in the eyes of his holiness
[2:09:54] was by sin.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; But God rich in mercy,
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; you got to love everybody.
[2:10:06] And one way of fixing your attitude
[2:10:10] in closing, when you see somebody that
[2:10:13] you think,
[2:10:16] you ought to say
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; that could have been me.
[2:10:23] You don't scone somebody because they're
[2:10:25] different.
[2:10:27] We come here to help people change.
[2:10:30] That's what the Bible is for. That's
[2:10:32] what it's for. This is a hospital.
[2:10:37] Hallelujah.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; And we want when people move out and
[2:10:40] leave out here, we want them to walk out
[2:10:42] here spiritually healthy.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's the way I see it.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; And I don't know who I said that to and
[2:10:51] why I said it.
[2:10:55] But I say it like this. Until you come
[2:10:57] to love what you call the unlovable,
[2:11:02] you haven't reached that.
[2:11:05] You're not ready for heaven yet
[2:11:08] until you come to love what we call the
[2:11:10] unlovable.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[2:11:16] Our heavenly father God, we come before
[2:11:19] you, Lord,
[2:11:21] as humbly as we know how.
[2:11:24] We thank you for your grace.
[2:11:26] We thank you for your mercy. We thank
[2:11:28] you for your love,
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:11:32] In that while we were yet sinners,
[2:11:35] Christ died for us.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; You're lovely, Lord.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; I want to love you the way you love me.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; I want to love your people
[2:11:47] the way you love me.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; I can't do it on my own.
[2:11:51] So we asking, hallelujah,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; that you would fill us
[2:11:56] completely
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; with the divine love that will constrain
[2:12:01] us
[2:12:04] every way to always obey your word.
[2:12:10] Let not your word
[2:12:13] be a burden to us,
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; but let your word
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; be our joy.
[2:12:19] Bless each and everyone here this
[2:12:21] morning.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Change the attitudes.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Change the differences.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Change the difference.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Help us now, Lord,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Let the word spoken this morning
[2:12:36] wash away all unbelief.
[2:12:39] Father, we'll be careful to give you the
[2:12:42] praise,
[2:12:43] glory, and honor in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[2:13:20] great heart
