thank God for the few faithful few amen God is so good to us amen into the chamber be free Holy Spirit speak to me gently as I [Music] into chamber [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a man shekinah unending is all I long for it is a thirst and desire that I have day by day in one of these old days where international never to come out again a man ain't God good I thought I cut it on brother I'm sorry I was wondering why we weren't blending a man good to see everybody we're not going to prolong the time amen we appreciate the Lord Jesus for being so good to us as we stand let us turn to st. Luke 21 we're trying out to be long I tried to preach this message in Iowa City I don't know how far I got with it but I was just being pooled by God to go in a certain direction and that was the way I I did go but anyhow God is good to us and we are blessed people we are blessed people I just my heart cries out and as I was saying this morning in Iowa City I want to see everybody make it a rapture we know the prophet of God said it's going to be a few and because we belong to a little system called a message the message is not systemized but men have done so but individuals who are free and will always be free because he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed and I just don't want to see people come to the end of the road and find themselves falling short I mean God warned us in the Word of God many of times but I feel like some of us are not paying attention to what's really happening and one of the things that Jesus even told us that we must watch and pray and we have as Christians many of us have lost our prayer lives and you know brother Ben who tells us that when we do that we're like dead we're dead Satan you you you've allowed Satan to come in at will when you lose your prayer life let's read this please Luke 21 34 to 36 and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your heart be overcharged with safaree and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that they come upon you unawares now watch this verse if I always mispronounce it so 14 amen so far teen it means to excessively over indulge in eating and drinking think about that it means to uncomfortably be full or crapulous feeling due to excessive eating and drinking now you may not think that's much but the Bible said it is and he tells us that Satan is laying a trap or snare look what it says for as a snare shall it come on them that dwell on the face of the whole earth and you know the Bible tells us that this is the day that we'll be eating drinking and giving in marriage partying having a great time eating is not necessity necessity is a pleasure you know and I know that we most of us most of us eat for pleasure and not for need Watchi therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man is this ok let's go to 2nd Peter 2:9 I really do appreciate you waiting on me I trust service was really good this morning amen second Peter 2:14 having I'm sorry I'm second Peter 2:9 the Lord know how to deliver the ungodly out of temptation and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished let us pray father God we come before your Lord we thank you for your amazing grace we think you for being so good to us Lord been better to us then we have been to ourselves we pray father for the service that your perfect will be done Lord we surrender all to you Lord touch this body of mine strengthen it Lord and give us grace to move completely out of your way and father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated what I've been working with by God's grace it's just the fact that there are two things happening and as a prophet of God said these two things this thing has two things have a grip either God is gripping you or have gripped you so he can pull you in to this image of God or Satan has gripped you with the mark of the beast and I feel like there's something moving that a lot of times people are not aware you see people don't run to say I'll take the mark of the beast we understand by the prophet of God he says to reject the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to receive the mark of the beast and knowledge has never saved anyone because this world is full of knowledge there's only one provided way and that is to be filled and sealed by the Holy Spirit there is a mocking going on and we know that a mocking is something that will distinguish you from something else the first marking was Cain when Cain dis basically argued with God disrespected him and refused a man to do as his brother Abel had done we understand by God's grace that God marked King and one of the things that Cain did afterwards is that he moved from the presence or out of the presence of God brother Branham liked it like this he went to the Land of Nod he went to the world basically to find a wife and then God raised up Seth and the Bible said that men then began to call on the name of the Lord the prophet of God actually likened that as a death and resurrection so you and I must understand by God's grace that there are things that you and I understand first of all God is never wrong he's always right secondly God never hybrids every see must come and be at his own kind even when it comes to the sons of God God tried to keep them separated because he knew the trick of the enemy and the enemy was to get into the human race and he did as you and I have heard you have heard how that God told Adam to multiply and replenish the earth and Adam never was able to accomplish what God had told him to do because he fell and he replenished the earth with what his own kind and the serpent and after trying to oh at the end of the day we find out that the serpent seed replenish the earth and Adam only had eight seas left and that was the family of Noah and the Bible said as it was in that day so shall it be in this day something took place and everybody it just seems like when it comes to those of us who around the message we we almost at ease things I in Zion and this is not a time to be at a ease watch and pray the Bible says we need to be on a lark Satan is doing all he can do to to to to deceive us and the Bible tells us that he can transform himself into an angel of light he could look like a real revelation and the whole time is Satan in disguise thank God for a prophet and understand when I say that because there's a difference in our revelation than everybody else's we didn't do this God did this he said he hide it from the wise and the PRU thank God for election because it's not your intelligence or your smartness that gets you into this message it's what God has determined before the foundation of the world and the Word of God can never come back void I love that I love the fact that my beginning did not start in 1956 hallelujah but my beginning in your beginning started back there as a thought where God wanted to be a parent he wanted to be a mother and a father hallelujah and God's words shall and will come to pass nothing can stop it but we need to be aware of who we are and what we are remember I said that right because if you are born wheat if you are the seed of God there is nothing that can stop you from your destiny hallelujah no matter what you go through how many times you fall how many times you come up short God has already predetermined me is that right and the Bible tells us that God has given us and expected in something we can look forward to hallelujah Satan hates that he cannot stop you but he can't hinder you you understand me but for every purpose that God has purposed in his heart for you he may be able to hold you up for a moment but in the mind of God you will accomplish everything that God has told you you will accomplish hallelujah can nothing stop you you understand me that's the difference a mark is different from a seal a seal is ownership when you're sealed that means God says your mind and you are going to make your destiny this box is so sealed it cannot be opened until it reaches its goal is that all right sometimes we don't even understand it meant we're where we what God is doing with us it because it's something that he reveals little by little little by little is that all right as you have heard me say before when God did anointed David King he was a little boy but he still was king he had to grow he had the mature hallelujah and God was with him every step of the way he said well what about Bathsheba God saw that before it even happened hallelujah is that right cousin Gordon brother Branham God saw the mixture he saw something he was going to mix and mix and mix and mix to come up with you so that the barrel could make a right sound hallelujah there could not have been a Solomon without bail Sheba no doubt David went by the wrong way but God told him all you had to do was ask I don't know how God would have done it but he would have done it hallelujah and look at this is Charles that even all things work together for the good of them dinner what love the Lord and those who are called to his purpose it had to be a Solomon and Solomon had to be a part of David because Solomon is the son of David and God liked love Solomon so much too he called himself the son of David so you and I must understand this God is never wrong as I said before and if there be any thought is in mankind is that right and as I said earlier to receive the mark of the beast is to reject the baptism of the holy ghost is that right now you say okay brother which I understand that but don't you thank God for the fact that you know the Holy Ghost is not all of these emotions I love every bit of them I love the shower I love to dance I love the worship I love the praise God but at the end of the day I love change I love the fact that once you change you change from glory to glory to glory to glory until you reach that goal hallelujah you don't change you it's the seed of God that God has in you that changes you hallelujah and no matter how much a a burro would love to be a wheat you can't do it unless God changed the nature of the kokuboro is that right even the scripture said we all had the appearance of the children of Wrath is that right and we know the Prophet God said we were born that way we look we had the image and everything else as the children of the wrath but inside of the inside of the inside woo was a wheat germ and what God needed to do was quicken that and if your quickened you have nothing to worry about hallelujah you say what do you mean brother Brooks because a true seed of God could never receive the mark of the beast I used to wonder Lord how all those people in the day the nor why could they God they were sons they had the appearance of sons because they were the sons of Adam hallelujah but it was the soul of those people that determine what they were and they locked themselves they mopped themselves because when the word of god came and threw Noah and Noah preached because they separated this self from the voice they mocked themselves and they received the mock hallelujah but those eight souls who followed Noah within the door and went through this the three stages of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost three levels hallelujah and it was that Ark that brought them over to the other land you understand me it was what was in them that God preserved because all flesh was destroyed but it was the soul that was in those eight Souls that God was looking at is that right so is it today our flesh is going to be destroyed but the soul that lives the song has been quickened the song it meant that have the holy spirit sealed are those who cross over hallelujah and it's okay you know the lineage of Cain you know they're so smart ain't nothing wrong we having a little brain a little smaller but you know they think they thought because of their brains because of their intelligence you know they were better than everybody else is that right that's why Cain could not accept God's offer because he thought his uh-uh-uh-uh-uh how could I say his provided way was better than God's provided way yeah and that's what happens let me tell you something no system can save you I don't care what you in Baptist Methodist Pentecostal even what you call a message because you come to message Church but that's what I tried to tell somebody the other day what distinguish you and what makes you Church is this picture of making you a message Church Oh what about this picture make your message Church not even the symbol makes you a message Church hallelujah a message Church is an individual with Christ on the inside God don't care about all that stuff but that's the deception everybody gotten got McDonald's you know golden arches this is what is likened to not trying to be blasphemous but every church must have these because if they don't they're not a message Church yeah that's the way people think that's the way they've been brainwashed but let me ask you something when the squeeze come on and we don't have a building to come on you come to do that does that mean you're no longer messenger the message Church is not a group of people they individual whom God is justified sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost living the message of their day people get offended because I look at all of these churches thousands of people and just like the brother over there in the Congo a man who had that priest ordained him that upsets me because that's a friend used to be a friend and as far as I'm concerned he still is but I remember when he used to be humble and now he's got a Catholic priests ordaining him and everybody's screaming you know what everybody I couldn't see this camera real good but the true seat of God wasn't excited about that hallelujah receiving the mark of the beast that's just what the Pentecostals just did a few years ago and here we are doing the same thing and here we are worshiping you know why they were able to do that because they let men take away the voice of God from them hmm don't you ever spout listening to your tapes don't you ever stop reading your books and like I said it is a shame that God has to raise somebody up to tell us to play the tape a shame its outright every buek because you should have never stopped hallelujah oh come on somebody everybody want to be an eighth angel forgive me sir but I can't find it in the word the only eighth angel I know is Jesus Christ himself because he's eternal Oh everybody you know every country got one you know I won with a real eighth angel stand up everybody y'all-y'all oh yeah y'all I'm telling you oh my is that right people listen what has happened and people do not like this what I'm getting ready to say don't you understand if you're not following truth when it comes to Jesus Christ you have come become a cult y'all hear them saying what I'm trying to say is this that's why brother one said whatever you do don't let yourself become cultish right because listen when you leave Jesus Christ out of the equation you have become a car hallelujah oh come on somebody see God is never wrong the Bible said he'll share his glory with know me and you and I must understand God is not here to share his glory with you not me not anybody else is that right let me read you something here I didn't get to this this morning but I wanted to hear it is a men in the in Hebrews chapter 2 he says listen and by His grace so none will have any excuse oh if they could forget the messengers and remember is not the messenger it's the message he comes down again with us in the form of a pillar of light and he moved with the same miracles and signs and nothing out of the Bible staying right with the Bible oh nothing happen the Bible staying with the Bible this is the original quote book come o you and I we understand the position men have played in the Bible full of the Holy Ghost but you know what revelation 5 says none were worthy none not one was worthy to loose the seal to open the book 9 only one hallelujah and that was Jesus Christ yo you what I'm saying you said what do you mean brother because if you lose vision a loose sight or who redeemed you Satan will mock you he will mark you because that's what came did he lost sight of his creator and he felt like he could talk to his creator any kind of way you can't talk to God any kind of way when God said do something the best thing you can do is say yes sir I'm going to do it you understand me listen listen here's another that's the way to do it believe what did he what did he touch listen I love this because people said what brother branham healed me and that's wrong brother Brendan constantly tell us he'd never healed nobody how many times you heard on the tape oh if I could just if I could heal you I would do it but I must wait on him he said hallelujah and then he goes on and you know Jesus Christ I yield one person when I heard that I'm like oh my what are you saying here hallelujah but he did not as a man he said I can't do nothing except the father showed me hallelujah he said I see the father working I'm working here the two the two whenever I see him move I move it's like a wheel in a wheel hallelujah Oh glory to God he just listen this is what he says I've never seen that man but he was healed right there he touched the Lord Jesus who is present here take away listen what he said take away that unbelief from you forget about me being William Branham look at Jesus Christ he's the one that's here I challenge your fame in crisis name to forget about me and believe that this is the Lord Jesus here and see what will happen I don't care where you are in this building hallelujah why because the Prophet was finite but Jesus Christ is Internet hallelujah that's what happened to Israel they were mocked because they kept their eyes on the veil they were blinded because they kept their eyes on the veil and Hebrews said that veil will be lifted when they turn to the Lord so is it in this message but I'm tell you what I'm getting in trouble with people because I'm trying to show them Jesus Christ who is the author and finisher of our faith I'm trying to show them that that's the reason why we're in the condition we're in now because we put so much emphasis on brother Branham we glorify the man the creature more than we did the Creator hallelujah he's worthy of honor there's never been a man like that man outside of Jesus who walked the face of the earth I agree with that but when God took that veil oh he did not stay unveiled yummy he came back in the power of the Holy Ghost now he's occupy other bodies more than just one of many members party I was telling the church down there I said we got so many symbols up in our church a lady coming near she says is this a Christian Church she saw everything but Jesus you understand what I'm trying to say what are we projecting what are we projecting you say brother until you try to say Libra no it's like telling Knorr nor are the flood about the flood and leaving out nor you can't leave Noah out it's what God did hallelujah you can't leave brother branham see that the fact of the matter is God told Moses I mean Joe Joshua remember all Moses taught so we must remember all William Branham God used William Bradford to teach us is that right how many times he say something he says I had to go back to hear what I said he was so caught up in the anointing he and God will was one so my so he didn't even remember himself and people of God that same anointing is what God is trying to put in us no we're not a prophet we don't have that office but we are the pride of Jesus Christ and all of the bride have a portion of a little tent discernment and everything that comes with it but this is not a one-man show anymore there'll never be another one-man show until Jesus Christ show a man but what is I'm trying what am I trying to bring us to to a place to see that we're liberated but at the same time we must always be watchful is that right I mean if you go back into Leviticus it tells about the year of Jubilee right every seven years and you know how it all goes but if that servant loved its master and wanted to stay with the master God that master would bolt a hole in his ear right and therefore he was a slave for the rest of his life hallelujah and brothers that's why God don't want us to be unequally yoked he don't want us to go to denominations organizations and all of that and marry one of them hallelujah because there come a time when you want to escape you won't be able to escape because you married one of them that's the law that's the law but if you came in free you can go out free if you win in married you can come out marry somebody help me here see when you and I must understand hallelujah this message is so powerful shame of us if we missed it amen but how God has made it so it is easy you know that he said it my yoke is easy and my burden is light hallelujah and that's what he said and that's what he means hallelujah oh I'm having such a hard time only because you ain't dead enough a dead man a hard you don't have no hard time like I told you you can go to a dead man and kick him and he won't even run hey kick one of these folks right here you in for a fight and you and I must understand we're talking about the marketer now look what I said I read that scripture about being careful about eating so much now we all do there are times we all overeat we all unless God done gave us a beaker maybe God then gave some of us the victory and because I'm a fat in summer skin it doesn't mean that skating people don't over over eat but that in itself it's a snare because the more you eat the less spiritual you are ma Oh y'all know it's the truth when you finish eating you overeat the first thing you want to do is sleep you know the guy reading your Bible you don't forgot a man prayed you know you just want to lay and enjoy your rest but think about it do you think Satan is fattiness up for nothing watch the cattle they feed them cattle make it eat as much as they want to you know why because that devil knows I'm setting him up for slaughter that's the truth I mean if we had to run from the devil we couldn't run I don't mean to be funny but it's true can't even run a block without dying almost it's the truth but understand what I'm trying to say the Bible tells us that if you're not careful this would be a snare right think about it because you're so eating you drinking you just enjoying yourself his eating was not supposed to be meant as such such a pleasure as it is now but the devil knows the human being loves to eat I enjoy food I love it when it's pretty and I love it when it's good and that's that's I have to fight with that all the time every day I can't every day right and will smell something not even hungry and we'll take that car ya'll North the truth but what's going to happened when the doors are shut and you have come become so accustomed to eating people says oh no I'll never do he's about the Bible say did you receive it in your head or in your hand right and this wouldn't you say well I could never sell my birthright for food Esau did he saw did it he got hungry enough thought the devil thought see you're gonna die probably was the first meal he missed in a long time and the devil told him if you do you gonna perish if you don't right so that's what he does he he dramatized it he puffs it up and if you get you to listen to it just in a moment time you receive the mark God cut Esau off right then hello y'all see what I'm trying to say so I want you understand it comes so easily when somebody witness to you says hey this is the truth and the person so no I'm not going away I love my church right there God marks them the only way that God doesn't mark you is that he see a germ there there's a seed germ from the founders in the world that declares unto God that that's you you want to hear is that right Paul called the Cree calls Christians the bat blaspheme right so but God could not destroy him because he was a seed not only was he's a seed but he was a star in the right hand and you and I must understand that's what this salvation is so secure y'all heard me preach it one time it's fixed it's been fixed amen and nothing can break the fact that God has already ordained you and I to be bribed now I came to explain while I'm buying bride but I know that I am I can't tell you when that revelation dropped in my soul but I know that I am do you make mistake I make mistakes but I know that I'm bribed I know that I have become his righteousness and he became my sin hallelujah that's right listen what he says now y'all don't hurt me quote just a lot because I do in the east of seal but we do one thing when they look around with all of these powers upon them they saw Jesus only talking about Peter James and John when they went to the Mount Transfiguration and the real true believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he only wants one thing for you to see that glorified Christ make makes any difference see a real true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ it didn't glorify Moses didn't glorify Elijah didn't glorify themselves didn't glorify nothing else but they seen the glorified Christ and in a true believer that's what's in his heart to glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's trying to get to the people to see and don't you know that it's difficult that is so difficult because we have and I'm saying I probably won't get invited to come to preach for nobody but I really don't care that might sounds terrible because I got enough work on my hands as it is but the point is we have commercialized William Branham so much and so long it's a shame and what it has done it has it has stumbled people who would perhaps be in the message right now but because of the way we handled it right I've been guilty I've not always seen it the way I see it now but if you true bride God will begin to open your eyes - what is truth and what is not because what we must understand is that when Jesus came in his day and fair in his day who was in the pulpit but Devils pre-chopped who had disguised themselves as Angels of Light and Jesus said if it wasn't if I had not come you will still have a cloak he said but now but I'm here I'm the light of the world I see what's in you is that right he said I would you look like that whites up look up but it wasn't me your dad means bone you look good outside with your religious garments on but I know what you are I'm agreeing with John the Baptist your serpents oh not in this message well you don't know your Bible because serpents show came out of Egypt with Moses hello did they not Dathan and Cora they were serpents they will preach us and they deceived and pull people away from the message of the hour and we got the same thing going on am I making sense it ain't gonna be but a few but I'm gonna tell you something you're marrying the Lord Jesus Christ and not the bridegroom I mean there are yeah you you're marrying the bride crew and not not the man that gives them away who you what you call it this yeah yeah ELISA let me just put it that way amen you're marrying Jesus is that right one of the great signs and I jumped that I told you I'm not gonna be long so I'm moving moving so that the thing that I want to say is this what was the great sign of Jesus Christ well in our day that said like this oh so I said well it was the healing it was not the healing it was healing in the Old Testament what is that right oh oh it was the raising of the day it was rain people were raised from the dead in the Old Testament he lied your bones right the men thrown he came back to life to Shunammite woman right the baby come back to life naming healed of leprosy in the Old Testament hallelujah but in this day what was it like brother Branham said there was he come to a woman at the well who she it was that discernment that declared he was the word because the Bible tells us that the Word of God is shopping it's quick like a two-year sword in his discerner of the heart the intents of the heart and is able to separate the joints in the marrow and that word living now in a vessel called Jesus whoa say woman go get your husband she says sir I have none he said you've spoken right you answered that you responded correctly said you had five you with one and the one you know and you have is not your own she saw we know ha ha ha that when the Messiah shall come see that what I'm talking about and you got to understand this later had to be after the scripture because it was over 400 years before they had a real vision four hundred eight hundred between that time can you imagine how is the United States I'll be 400 years oh yeah so think about how long that was before they had a vision or a voice but yet and still even when God wasn't moving there was somebody passing it on see God has never left himself without a witness hallelujah now you show up with a break but the prodigal says listen when I went to the Baptist Church and I found out they had doctrines I couldn't deal with so I had to leave there then I went over to my mother lost church and they were Methodists and I found out the day I couldn't deal with them he had to search for God if you want to say like this I led him through those channels so that he can see the thing that's right the only thing that's right is the Word of God even the Bible says seven women and none of them were faithful and that was a type in the shadow of type of the seven Church ages hallelujah in all of that none of them were faithful but God in His mercy and His grace kept those who he had in his mind from receiving the mark of the beast say don't do whatever you want but don't touch the oil in the wine hallelujah that portion you cannot touch thank God for the word is that Alright Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it was that discernment huh it was that thing when when that prophet come to that that pool in that third pool he says God was going to show him you know uh-uh that's the second pool how he was going to discern the thoughts of the heart and in all of the things that was Jesus Christ the Son of Man in a son of man revealing himself that man could not have done that hallelujah it was God talking and as God talked he talked and as God revealed visions he had the vision he saw the vision he could call it out but no man can do that I don't care if they work the biggest Ouija board in the world only God can discern that way am I making sense no you said what what do you mean see it's that sign that is the sign of the resurrection that Jesus Christ is still alive huh the Old Testament showed he was alive he was God and those healings those miracles and all of that was he this gleaming from the book of life lamb took a life that was already established the blood of the Lamb that had been slain before the foundation the Lord this is the prophets word they were grieving from that pulling from that well if the Old Testament can pull from it what about the Lu we've got the real thing we got the Alpha and the Omega and people are afraid to believe the UH the things that caught that that that the scientists say is impossible impossible with me Jesus smoked that right he said it's impossible for a rich man you know to be saved right they thought he said no no no no it's hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle but I can save a rich man you see God can save whoever he wants to slay Oh somebody help me here you see we can't almost believe this message almost festa said unto Paul you almost made me a believer you can't almost believe it you got to give it all your heart mind and so if you wanted to see it work right hallelujah it's like baking a cake you leave one or two agree ingredients it out it'll never turn out right in order to make it right us use all the ingredients in order to make it right you must use all the ingredients you want to see Christ in you you got to go the provided way you got to be justified you got to be sanctified you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost and God Himself was being stepping to your Tabernacle then you are truly adopted son manifested among the people y'all hear what I'm saying but when he came with the discernment and everything guess what people said just like they said to Jesus that's Beelzebub that's witchcraft he's reading the minds of the people yeah the same thing but elected caught it to them it was an Eagles cry y'all hear what I'm saying now I'm trying to tell us something I'm gonna be much longer because I'm trying to say the mark of the beast the only one thing that protects you is your election that's the only thing we don't even know why we won't bow down to other things because it's Christ in us right you look at Daniel we're not gonna bow you look at the Hebrew boys we're not gonna bow now our prophet came and told us that the image that was raised up in Nebuchadnezzar that day was the image of the prophet Daniel himself and Daniel would not even bow to the image so why are we bowing revelations amen when it with me when John fell down to bow down to the ages that get up from there and worship God oh I'm like a brother I'm just your brother hallelujah only God amen his honor of worship y'all know what I'm saying in that right you heard me say this the other day and I'm gonna say it again even when the rich young ruler came to Jesus a good master Jesus stopped him he said why call it me good there's only one good and that's God see the man himself see he's the word corrects hallelujah jesus said I came to nothing except the father show me I'm not preaching to gods I'm preaching 1 I'm preaching out of Matthew I'm in st. John 17 father I would that they be one even as we are one and you must come and ask God what is this oneness because without that you won't know your potential you won't know where you can go you got to see that that oneness is God what God desire to have with you is that right even God Jesus said listen to the Lord the Lord loves us just like he loved Jesus whoo that's right you know why because we are his body you know I must say this I left this out but let me say you know how big is one of our biggest enemies is is rock and roll now I don't know what real rock and roll we are somebody gonna have to educate me but but I do know that it is one of those things that Satan uses often to deceive people and and and and the devil doesn't care if you use Jesus name in it because he knows you your high breeding somebody help me here in the message and fallible proof he says now Jesus will not come into your presence when you're carrying on with your rock and roll in boogie-woogie and all that stuff there I don't care what church you belong to Jesus don't come into those conversations he don't dwell among those kind of things so change your conversation if you want to see him do as they did meditate on him let your conversations be upon him and his resurrection for he has risen from the dead now he said oh brother why are you saying that because I want you understand that's what King never never could never said if you bow down to the it to the music you must bow when the trumpets and everything sounds right Satan was the the the the main person over the music of heaven so he knows what God likes and he knows what God doesn't like he knows how to pervert it hallelujah hallelujah that's why when we sing we want God to come on the scene hallelujah is that right so you look at this and you say well brother what are you trying to say let me say it like this hey man tried to mark the Jews did he not but you see those Jews had something Haman didn't know about they had a covenant God had already told them as long as you be be obedient to the Babylonians I'll preserve you yeah Jeremiah told him that said now but when you go up there messing up and acting up like you're not gonna be obedient I'll let you be destroyed but if you obedient I'll be with you and those Jews were obedient and and you said well what were you but there was an Esther and Haman really didn't start acting up until yesterday mean seemed like his his his hatred for Jews became more intense don't you understand and to the Queen was made manifest when the devil Haman realized she's queen now he didn't know it was Esther he didn't know but he understood that Mordecai represented something he did not like he hated him who is this Mordecai he's a Jew he's not going bow to you Haman you understand me see and that's frustrated the devil the devil get frustrated when he find out that you will not bow to him he gets really angry when he brings a new doctrine right that's off the word and you won't bow he gets angry with you when you see Jesus Christ only oh yeah you're a real deal you can see he don't care if you're blind it can lead you into a ditch if you're blind but you gotta understand Queen Esther I love Esther it means stop and Esther Esther is so many ways you can work this but the thing I'm trying to get with is this s there was a prayer warrior and when look at Esther when she said I want you to fast I want you to fast three days right don't eat bread or water night or day and then I'm going to see the king it's like something she represented she had to die there hell herself to resurrect before she could go to see the king and she said if I perish let me pet you understand me she died to herself her life meant nothing she didn't care about being a queen she cared about her people that's a real soldier of the Lord when he cares less about himself but more about the people of God but you watch those preachers listen let me tell you something a preacher was made a servant he was not made to be served but we got it backwards we got it all mixed up he's a king among the message somewhere y'all understand what I'm saying we got it is that right Jesus said come on Peter let me wash your feet let me show it how it's done this is humility this is the way it is I must serve you I must be the example of serving but now you've got preachers you got to carry their books you got to put a fan over the end and walk with some kind of answer entourage and you got to protect them they got to have bodyguards it's true it's backwards and yet the people cannot see show me at any point in time when brother Branham had such a thing as dad and he was our example Christ in him right but nowadays you take the message and you take the preachers day and gonna like me about whether I don't care you know understand but the truth is the truth this ain't no time to be deceived you got to know you got Jesus about God and you as they do it was a Catholic Church that's the Nicolaitans spirit that little spirit amen they became a doctrine and we carry on like we never were at the church agent I ever heard it but the people become slaves y'all know this the truth I have always said if I say anything across the pulpit that you don't understand that you obligated to ask me what it means I don't have a problem with that because it's for you to learn it's for us to know and what if I'm wrong you could help me who you could be wrong brothers I can be wrong I'm almost done with these thoughts but I'm throwing out some things because I want you to understand she thought because she understood her rights to fight even when the King said you know his word cannot return back void the Jews will be killed and Esther said no within herself there's got to be a possibility there's got to be a way of getting around this all King let me tell you something who I love the way she worked it though she had three pools brother hallelujah and she comes up to the king and he reaches out because you got to understand Elster would did not come before the t king with some sackcloth and ashes in stir came before the king with that beautiful dress that she knew he liked hey that's what I'm saying you come before God in the garment he likes what garment he likes the garment of praise that's the best what he likes so she entered into the cheese chamber evening with the garment of praise and she got what she wanted some time y'all we act like we don't know what we do it but I try to tell people you watch those little girls when it comes to their daddies they know how to work it hallelujah Amen she give him that smile and get all up on his lap and all play with whatever he's got and then you know he knows she wants something even if she haven't said what it is and he's ready to empty his pocketbook out for oh I just want a dollar okay honey you could have no imma give you to y'all because she know how it works but like when we get older we forget you want something from God you need to learn how to praise him hello he inhabits the praise of his people if you want so don't come with no sackcloth and ashes like you don't have no faith in God say it faces and all kind you'd be after the Africa like God don't be moved by the way you screaming holla God want to see your heart am I making sense oh lord help us Jesus I'm not trying to say they're not times when desperation strikes you but when desperation strikes you don't have protocol right you don't have time to be polite you don't have time you know to be nice there's something in your heart and your mind and you're going after it right let me close in just a moment what I'm trying to do with the people I'm trying to show that religion is something that has been since the Garden of Eden so garden scene he's seen plenty of religion you've seen religious people probably all the way up to here God ain't stirred about your religion he won't see change his whole purpose is to see his image multiply I love it he wants to see his image multiply hmm like I said the new world is coming and only the new creatures will enter into the new world there will not be anything that would defile the city in the new world there'll be nothing there that would make a lie in the new world so somehow we must change and the only thing only person who can change you is God himself because the Bible says no man and one cubit to his stature so what what what happens how do we get there the simple method of prayer you have not because you ask not and then when you ask you must ask in faith because faith is the only thing that pleases God you love the Lord you said well old brother Brooks what about the mark of the beast just like I said you and I because of this message we we know the devil's tactics we know what he's coming with and you got to watch what he's doing because here try to get you off the words but you got to stay on the word that is your only protections to stay with the word and when you stay with the word people ain't gonna like you even among this message they don't care for you and let me tell you something even when you got man that's allowing people to just worship them in in that simple way they don't even realize it because you know what they doing they just following tradition see and that's why they didn't like Jesus he tore up all those Jews traditions he taught up how come you won't even wash your hands all right how can you be eaten like that and in here John and his disciples they came and they were faster but y'all eatin you are in number gluttons how can this be I thought Jesus knew he wasn't gonna be ruled by no man's Crees dogmas isms or schisms and when you become like that you look like a rebellious child but you're not rebellious see that's why they didn't like brother Branham cuz he would tell it he tell it just like it is he told him what they were doing he told him and he basically told him you serpents he did he told him basically he said just a G just what Jesus said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sins thank God for believing and acting upon that which we believe you love the Lord I appreciate you I thank you for like I said waiting up waiting on me and forgive me if I rushed and I did but I was just you know I know you you're probably tired or but my thing is people watch and pray go study are there in Jude and I didn't read Jude Jude 1 11 through 13 16 talks about Dathan and Cora and excuse me talks about cane Cora and Balaam and and and see what not only those words mean but what they did we're not talking about the world we taught my religious spirits that's working in the realm of the message Church now we know you said what about later they'd already done indeed God then left that they have been bundled just a burn now we're in the bride age the age of adoption and do you think that the devil is going to let you build your wall do you think he's gonna let God just build this perfect statue of Christ without interfering they wouldn't even let Israel or build the wall some ballot and all the rest on me men came against Israel so much so they had to have a scalpel and running and a sword in the other and I'm gonna tell you what you gotta fight for every inch of this territory to Jesus calm but it's worth the battle it's worth the battle lest and there are some things I may not know there are some places and I cannot go but there's one my god is real I can't feel him in my face - no God in real he's real in my soul oh my god is real hurry and wash me Oh his laughs only it just like oh my god is real I can feel him in my soul oh yes sir I cannot bring Jesus wash all of my oh wait [Music] my god my god is real I can feel him in my soul hey man you feel him in your soul even when you don't feel and he's still there he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you amen hallelujah thank you brother see there is
