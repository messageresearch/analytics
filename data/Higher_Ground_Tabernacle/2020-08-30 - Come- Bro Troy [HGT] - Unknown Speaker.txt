around our country the damage that was done here in our estate by that storm but yet the bride of christ was not damaged amen and with all this virus they say there's a threat of death or discomfort but for the bride of christ there is no threat of death amen there is no threat of uh wasting away and passing away because one of for the last time i'll open them again in a moment in another place another dimension and there is no fear those around us that are the young men were out witnessing yesterday as i understand we have something to be a witness about that let's just uh stand this morning as we get into the word of the lord actually we'll start at the uh 27th verse it says there in verse 27 why speakest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hidden from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth he fainteth not neither is he weary for there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faith and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary even the young men shall utterly fail but they that way upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as the eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and they shall not faint amen amen israel my destiny [Music] heavenly father we just dedicate this time this morning unto you we lord at the end of the week lord the beginning of a new week father we dedicate ourselves we've received your may your bride rise up with the wings of the single lord increase your strength in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen i think it's uh all christians come to a place in their lives where they're tired you know we come down to the bottom of a valley you can look back to the times when you're on the mountaintops and you're just saying i'm just a little worn out just a little tired i need a refreshing of the lord but you know when we come down to those times he doesn't sit down and think well i'm just going to sit here and starve to death but no he does something about it no you fight you pick yourself up he goes down to the refrigerator where he can get a meal if he begins to get thirsty on a hot day he begins to feel fate he goes and gives himself a drink of water and he does that in faith as he begins to drink that water that strength will be renewed and even so is the same with the christians many are christians but there it says there in the book of isaiah don't you know haven't you heard not the everlasting god the lord jehovah the creator of the ends of the earth when you wake up at two in the morning he is there you wake up four in the morning amen the the the spirit of the lord god is still brooding over the earth just like in the days of noah that dove that was sent out of the ark that dove is still circling the earth at two in the morning he's still looking for a place to live uh even at four in the morning that doesn't matter spirit is still looking for a place to land ten o'clock at night when you're praying the lord is still looking for a place please please don't look for someone to hear their prayers at one in the morning god is still looking upon the earth who is praying right now you have in your mind you have this faith that rises up within you don't vote [Music] now you go to some restaurants you know they're a lunchtime restaurant they're only open from 10 a.m to 2 p.m if you go to that restaurant at 1 in the morning you just know that all the lights will be off you gotta open the door but there's some restaurants they're open twenty four seven yes out there and our that you're getting tired you you maybe you feel like giving up something the bible says even the young men remember even the young men begin to get tired [Music] and i am going to see if the holy spirit of the living god will come across this way you know the door is not unlocked in south africa we are looking for a restaurant in the evening time we went to the small it might have been in johannesburg and we went to this restaurant i think it was 10 o'clock at night they were open easy duvet so we went in there and they the waiter waitress set us down she took our order for our drinks brought out her pepsis i said hey we'd like to order some food she said i'm sorry our kitchen is closed we're only serving drinks and i i thought we came to this restaurant to get some food why did you let us come in here we're hungry just to find out the kitchen is closed we wiped the dust off our feet we shook our hands at that place we got ourselves out of there in some salty uh we went to a place that was serving food we didn't come for a part-time restaurant just a halfway restaurant we wanted to be fit in the bride of christ let me tell you if she ever gets to a place where she gets worn out she's getting a little tired upon life's journey she doesn't feel that zeal anymore she doesn't feel that she if she was to think about witnessing she couldn't call up the strength to be a witness to somebody let me tell you my friend you need a revival you need a revival of your spirit you need to rise up with your wings like an ego to make her home there amongst the trees and live there lego department that amen let's turn over to isaiah chapter 55. our god is the god of invitation not reducing the jews he he was sacrificed one time he gave the sacrifice one time the holy spirit of the living god the sentence goes up and and joins himself to that prayer it makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered amen isaiah chapter 55. i love this hey he says ho verse one you'll see uh oh everyone the thirstus come you to the waters and here that has no money come and buy and eat hey i'm telling you come vinnie for that which satisfies here listen come dedicate yourself diligently unto me on verse 2. eat that which is good and let your soul delight itself and veterans listen to me eat that which is good i think we spent too much time eating those things that are not good and then we wonder why we get ourselves in the condition that we are in and then we begin to pray oh lord i wish i could be a better christian oh lord i wish i could have that zeal of the holy ghost think to myself oh lord god where is my zeal let me tell you the answer is right here look upon those things that are good upon those things that are righteous looking upon those things that are clean look upon the word of god spend all of our time looking upon the things that are unclean david was doing pretty good man david was doing a good job as a king one day he started looking out the window we started looking out the window he began to stumble spend our when the kings went out to battle let me tell you if you don't if you're not reading your bible and you're praying you have no right to ask where your zeal is gone if you won't do the first things you have no right to ask where your zeal is gone because let me tell you it left you when you decided not to hearken until those things that are good it lasts when you when you when you wouldn't come to the living fountains of living why are you spending your money on those things that is not bread why are you giving your labor for those things that don't even satisfy go and you're right where you were when the movie started and you're still left there wondering who you are wondering why you're in this condition wondering what you ought to be doing with your life it was not like some pokemon failing feeling down feeling depressed uh wondering what to do with your life and you're spending your time for those things that don't even edify it by civil times you're spending your time on those things that have no eternal worth it dries up the trees around you look up your eye lift up your eyes the holy spirit is still brooding upon the earth the dove has left the ark the trees open up the book of acts and read it from the first cover to the last cover and let me tell you if you can read that book of acts identify yourself with one of those men revelations of laodicea spending their time on the things that are evil and none of those things has everlasting worth doing those things that didn't mean anything you don't see physical but one of those but one day the lord jesus christ came across his path because the lord jesus christ met him as a pillar of fire focusing upon the things of the world he lifted up his eyes he saw and that one that he says i am the lord jesus christ i am the one that you've been persecuted he gave him the invitation come on to me let me tell you there is there is more surrounding us it's just it's in another dimension but we get so blinded by the things of the squirrels we can't see that we're surrounded by a heavenly kingdom there's a heavenly kingdom all around us it's all it's just over the doorpost there there there's a kingdom that cannot be hit yeah oh man there is there is uh the streets of gold are all around us the power of the world to come is all around us we can walk on the water spend your time on these things that these video games and we're wasting our lives away god is brooding over this earth where can you land he is here to enliven you amen that he might come and give you life he gave you life that you see around us they're all fake amen men have built these but god will cut bring these walls crashing down men put these lights in the ceiling but [Music] maybe 20 or 30 years old buddy [Music] this highway is faster than the speed of light hey man his information will never cease [Music] pictures over the fiber optics and over the wires but there is a higher vision than that [Music] they have this virtual reality you can put on your face so you can be transferred into i'm already living in a world that is a little bit faster than this one i mean i don't have to put a pair of those goggles on you should jump i don't have to sit with a screen in front of my face all the time i don't have to have my mind tickled by one of these movies or these video games because i'm living in a lane it's this mortal body might try to wear us down come into this ark coming to this arc i've prepared a place of safety for you yes just come right into here yeah you see yeah no i left a world of wickedness behind just get no evil moses was bringing the children of israel through the wilderness as he began to talk to jethro he saw his brother-in-law and in numbers 14-14 i'll just paraphrase it here and and moses he sits down he begins to talk to his brother-in-law uh and he says we are journeying we are journeying into the place of which is we know [Music] [Music] amen in isaiah 1 18 it is come now let us reason together saith the lord although your sins will be a scarlet they will be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool our god is constantly being giving invitations that's why i entitled at this this morning and i am living my life according to that vision reached out to the book of acts he pulled out that that scripture that's salty and he went to chicago and he told those those ministers he says just like saint paul come simple i have lit i have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision pointy this would be something and all these apps that i have done i have done them according to a heavenly vision hey man so even though the christian they might get a little weary they might get a little tired focus on jesus said come unto me all ye that are laboring someone all that are burdened and heavy-laden i will give you lay your burdens down lay all your foolishness down let me tell you he knows where you are he knows what you're doing he knows right where you are exactly he knows all of your weaknesses he knows all of your transgressions your sins are not hid from him just get yourselves down to the altar lay tiles [Music] don't need these lights for the lord jesus christ there will be no churches there for the spirit of the living god will be singing inside of all of our hearts amen amen matthew 22 4 he said again he sent forth his servants saying tell them which forbidden behold i have prepared my dinner my ox and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage our god has prepared a feast amen amen our god has prepared a feast amen if you could just get your eyes off the things of the world and the foolishness of this world and get yourselves open your eyes to live this natural life and men will look at them how do they fly up [Music] you get that joy that you always have why is it that you are never afraid of this or that brother did you hear that the world is ending tomorrow why should the sun is shining every morning the birds and i am living in the paradise of god [Music] [Music] the holy spirit is looking to see who's who who whose prayers he can answer he's making a recession for you right now he's looking to see who he can fill with the holy ghost this is the waiting for you just to turn your heart [Music] jerusalem and all of a sudden he he watched it being built and he was told to go and measure the place and measure every little bit a little bit of it and all of a sudden the lord told him stand off over here by the side and we went over there and he looked at the gate of jerusalem as the sun was rising he saw it that gate was facing the east the sun came passing through the land and it came to that gate that was facing the east valley and it passed through that gate into the holiest of holies let me tell you every single one of us greater and you will be filled with the holy ghost amen amen ezekiel said and i saw the presence of god coming to the gate that was faced towards the east we get our eyes upon those natural things of this world let me tell you keep that door facing towards you after the wedding supper was made ready the householder spoke to his servant in luke chapter 14 17. and his uh and he said his uh and he sent his servant suppertime to say to them they were bitten all things are now ready and as the demons are fighting all over and they got their swords in their poison darts [Music] the lord jesus christ let's come right here let me just give you a little meal right now that's why we come to church that's why we read our bibles that's why we close our eyes and enter into heavenly places thoughts to an invitation that has been given to us or tablet or phone or whatever amen eating that which is good amen as we read there in the beginning wherefore do you spend your money for that which is not bread that's isaiah 55 2. why do you do it wherefore do you spend your money for that which is not brit why are you spending your labor for that which satisfy us diligently he says hearken diligently unto me he says eat that which is good and then you get to the third let's read that where verse two actually i'm gonna read this again real what did david find out that his mercies were everlasting great diseases you can read between the lines of some of the diseases amen and and it was insane sometimes and transgressions [Music] do this there are times he was on the mountain of god knowing that the strength of god was and every ounce was behind him he knew the sure mercies of god amen amen hearken diligently unto me eat that which is good emoji listen to me and your soul shall live amen amen i remember in the when they were going through the wilderness that they were crying out for meat and he says that while the quail was still in between their teeth while after they were eating while the meat of that quail was still in between their teeth the gods died and they called that that name of that place i'm gonna call i'm gonna read it off here it's a long word they called the name of that place good luck i already said it you don't have to they called they named that place it's about 15 letters long and that place is a memorial grave that is there the the the thoughts of the mind but as these men left egypt behind with the promise of the promise of a of a promised land [Music] and all of a sudden their attention got diverted and they started looking back at the things and they're buried in a grave called the graves of those that lusted it even the young man can get wore out even the young man can you get tired but those that wait upon the lord that promise is not just to the young man promises to those that wait upon the lord let's be those that answer him you have always been faithful to give us these messages every sunday and every wednesday without fail speaking unto us of this heavenly kingdom lord are we we don't want to be those to is one of the greatest things in the christian life [Music] who can get ready if we don't have the revelation who will prepare themselves for the world to come and many will die [Music] we've been diligent to spend our time looking after the kingdom [Music] we know the spirit of the living god is inside of us if anybody comes up to us and says brother okay why are you always so happy we can look at them sensei i have the spirit of an eagle inside of me the legendary amen thank you lord for giving us an escape from this world of sin where i see things that disturb me and all of a sudden you just don't worry anymore we worry how can we fear how can we worry [Music] let them have the strength to look up to you just uh lay it all down upon an altar let's see and i pray that they would be a witness to you let it be unto them according to thy words in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen brother's going to sing a few songs if anybody desires prayer but i just encourage you if this sermon has touched you if you know you're not living a life worthy of this gospel if you know you're not living a life that's worthy of this god and lay these foolish things down in the sight of the lord jesus
