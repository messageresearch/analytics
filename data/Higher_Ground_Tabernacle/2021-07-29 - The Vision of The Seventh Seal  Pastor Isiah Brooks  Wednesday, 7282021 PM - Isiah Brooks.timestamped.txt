[0:00] through 15. keep therefore
[0:04] the words of this covenant and do them
[0:07] that ye may prosper in all that you do
[0:12] yay stan this day all of you before the
[0:16] lord your god
[0:18] captains of tribes you elders
[0:22] and your officers with all the men of
[0:25] israel
[0:26] your little ones your wives your
[0:28] strangers
[0:29] that is in thy camp from the heavens
[0:33] excuse me from the viewers of woods unto
[0:36] the drawers of thy water
[0:38] that thou shalt should it uh that thou
[0:41] should um utter unto enter into
[0:45] covenant with the lord thy god and into
[0:49] his oath which the lord thy god maketh
[0:52] with thee this day that he
[0:55] may establish thee today for
[0:59] people unto himself and that he may be
[1:03] unto thee a god as
[1:06] he hath said unto thee and as he has
[1:09] shown sworn unto the father to abraham
[1:12] and to isaac and to jacob
[1:14] neither will you you only do i make
[1:18] this covenant and this oath
[1:21] but with him that standing here with
[1:24] us this day before the lord our god
[1:28] and also with him that is not here
[1:31] with us this day it kind of like sounds
[1:34] like
[1:36] what jesus the word of god says this
[1:38] promise is unto you
[1:41] and to your children and even
[1:44] to them that are far off the same kind
[1:48] of covenant
[1:49] just shorter words because jesus is
[1:52] saying to
[1:53] israel i'm giving you a covenant
[1:56] and i'm giving you a word and and this
[1:58] word is cons
[2:00] concerning you and me i'm going to make
[2:02] a covenant with you
[2:04] i'm going to let's put it this way i
[2:07] want to make you my bride
[2:09] because remember jehovah had a bride too
[2:14] and of course she failed him because she
[2:16] chose
[2:17] to walk in the ungodly way
[2:20] and she was so influenced at one point
[2:23] in time
[2:24] by a woman called jezebel and jezebel
[2:27] was
[2:28] what we call a prostitute or and
[2:30] she
[2:31] married into uh the the
[2:34] israel camp let's put it this way
[2:37] because ahab was the king
[2:39] and ahab was a uh uh israel a light
[2:42] and and he married a worldly woman and
[2:45] this woman
[2:46] changed israel so much to
[2:49] she killed every prophet of jehovah
[2:52] everyone that she could get a hand on to
[2:54] she killed him
[2:56] hallelujah and that same spirit
[3:00] is working today and and you know she
[3:04] had
[3:04] a a a a daughter called athalila
[3:08] i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly
[3:10] but she was just as wicked as her
[3:12] her mom but the word of god to elijah
[3:16] said that you're going to die
[3:20] jezebel because of all the wickedness
[3:23] you've done
[3:24] and guess what the dogs are going to eat
[3:27] your flesh
[3:29] now we know that aunt delilah had a she
[3:31] was rejected of israel and
[3:33] and and you know during the time when
[3:34] they had to hide the royal seed
[3:38] from her because she wanted she thought
[3:40] she was to reign
[3:41] and you must understand that at the lila
[3:44] amen is a type of the denomination
[3:47] because you understand rome or
[3:50] the catholic church or and i'm not here
[3:52] to preach on the catholic church
[3:54] i'm just saying there is a system of
[3:57] protestants and catholics that are
[3:59] working together
[4:00] and this system has come together to
[4:03] destroy
[4:04] the royal seed but in all of this
[4:09] you must understand what's moving the
[4:12] system of the world today
[4:14] something you think you can't you cannot
[4:16] see but because of the message
[4:19] of this hour we can see the spirit
[4:22] that's moving
[4:24] yes it's going to turn everything that
[4:27] you see
[4:28] now that seem to be far away from
[4:30] christianity
[4:31] is going to turn and when it turns
[4:35] christianity will be the target and
[4:38] every christian
[4:40] that's conservative or those of you who
[4:44] believe in morals and morality who
[4:47] understand that the system that is
[4:49] moving
[4:49] in now is not of god hallelujah
[4:54] it's the same thing amen that they did
[4:56] in the anteluvian day
[4:58] they forgot about god and they chose
[5:00] science and science brought them their
[5:02] destruction
[5:04] and the same thing has happened to
[5:05] america we kick god out of school we
[5:08] kick
[5:08] god out of out of church basically we
[5:12] he's he's out of the church he's no
[5:14] longer there
[5:15] we kick god out of politics we kick god
[5:17] out of everything
[5:19] amen is that right
[5:22] rome uh revelations the third chapter he
[5:25] stands at the door
[5:26] knocked and i know and wanted to come in
[5:28] and many people think that's an
[5:29] individual no no no
[5:31] he's trying to come into the age of
[5:33] laodicea and they wouldn't have him
[5:38] see when they rejected malachi 4 they
[5:40] did not understand
[5:42] they were actually fulfilling that
[5:44] scripture
[5:46] because christ was here in that prophet
[5:50] and when they rejected him like israel
[5:54] rejected samuel
[5:58] is that right
[6:02] they did the same and all day
[6:05] they wanted somebody educated they
[6:08] wanted somebody
[6:09] to be a king and they are going to get
[6:12] their king
[6:14] but i said all of this because here god
[6:17] is making a covenant he says i'm not
[6:19] only just giving this covenant to your
[6:20] immediate family
[6:21] but i'm giving you this covenant all i
[6:23] want the ones who are
[6:24] with you the strangers the visitors you
[6:27] know who's ever with you
[6:29] i'm offering this to them as well
[6:34] in 29th verse of the 29th chapter of
[6:39] deuteronomy this is one of the key
[6:42] scriptures
[6:45] it says the secret things belongs unto
[6:49] the lord our god
[6:52] but those things we reveal belongs
[6:55] unto us and to our children forever
[6:59] that we may do all the words
[7:02] of this law and that's exactly what god
[7:06] has done in this last day
[7:09] he is he god himself amen
[7:12] is the is the mastermind
[7:16] and there is no way you can figure him
[7:19] out
[7:20] but once we come to see what god has
[7:23] done for us
[7:24] in this last day it'll make it all to
[7:26] make you love him in a way
[7:28] that you'll do right
[7:31] because the bible says that the the the
[7:34] love of god
[7:36] the goodness of god draws should draw
[7:38] men
[7:39] to repentance hallelujah
[7:43] deuteronomy 30 amen 11-15
[7:46] says for this commandment which i
[7:48] command this day
[7:51] it is not hidden from thee neither
[7:54] is it far off see what it is we we
[7:58] don't understand what god is doing
[8:01] because
[8:02] we we we we think that we got to work it
[8:07] when we was in denomination when we was
[8:09] in say
[8:10] you know what denominationalism
[8:13] organizationalism is a type of egypt
[8:16] because you are bond you're in bondage
[8:20] and you always have that task master
[8:23] that drives you that enslaves you
[8:27] he becomes your master and
[8:30] it takes the message to literally free
[8:34] you
[8:35] from that and while you're there
[8:38] the dev while you're in egypt he always
[8:41] give you laws
[8:42] law law you can't do this you can't do
[8:44] that don't touch this don't taste that
[8:46] see we're beyond that you say well how
[8:49] can you say we're beyond that because
[8:51] really
[8:52] when you come to understand that you
[8:55] have been predestinated
[8:57] that you were in the mind of god before
[8:59] the foundation of the world
[9:01] if your bride i was telling the devil
[9:04] you are a loser
[9:08] nothing you can do can stop me
[9:12] yeah you fail you fall you fail you fall
[9:15] and
[9:16] the thing is the just man
[9:19] falls seven times in a day he gets up
[9:23] there's a power in him that makes him
[9:25] get up
[9:27] he's not a quitter he can't quit
[9:31] he might fall but he gets up hallelujah
[9:35] why is something in him that's a driving
[9:37] force
[9:38] that makes him get up what is that force
[9:42] god amen
[9:45] it ain't you it's not you it never
[9:48] happened you
[9:49] you didn't make your mind up to serve
[9:51] god god chose you
[9:53] it was god who drew you it god it's god
[9:56] who continually
[9:58] draws you
[10:01] but a lot of time we think god is in
[10:03] heaven
[10:04] he is yet and still he is not
[10:09] in heaven only hallelujah
[10:14] hello deuteronomy says for this
[10:17] commandment which i command
[10:19] thee this day it is not hidden from thee
[10:22] neither is it far off
[10:26] right we had a prophet come speak a
[10:29] message the spoken word is the original
[10:32] seed
[10:33] god came through that mouth and told us
[10:36] that we're little creators
[10:38] we're messiahs connected with god
[10:43] born of god and when you're born of god
[10:46] you'll chip off the rock
[10:51] you're part of it his abilities become
[10:54] your abilities
[10:56] hello this is what we must come to
[10:58] recognize
[11:00] that when the message was open when the
[11:02] seventh seal was open
[11:04] amen you must understand that that what
[11:06] it was
[11:07] was done in a way that nobody knew
[11:11] when it happened but we find out that
[11:14] that seventh seal was open
[11:16] underneath the sixth seal so when the
[11:19] seventh seal
[11:20] opened there was silence
[11:23] well i was a silence because god had
[11:26] already done this thing
[11:31] i got a quote i got a quote to make you
[11:33] see what i'm talking about
[11:35] see i want you to understand that's why
[11:37] everybody's looking they're looking
[11:39] they're looking
[11:40] and the answers are already there it's
[11:43] in the book
[11:44] that's why brother brown said it could
[11:46] nothing could be added to it
[11:49] so whatever the silence was it has to be
[11:52] in shadow and type
[11:53] somewhere it has to be in the book
[11:57] but it's up to us to find out where it's
[11:59] at
[12:02] it's been in your face all along but
[12:05] look what it goes on to say
[12:08] it is not in heaven that thou shalt say
[12:11] who shall go up for us to heaven and
[12:14] bring it unto us
[12:16] that we may hear it and do it neither is
[12:19] it beyond the sea
[12:20] that thou should say who shall go over
[12:23] to see
[12:24] for us and bring it unto us that we may
[12:28] hear it and do it but the word
[12:31] is very nigh thee
[12:35] right in thy mouth
[12:39] and in thy heart thou thou mayeth
[12:42] do it what what are you saying
[12:46] see we didn't understand it we did not
[12:49] see
[12:50] what the real baptism of the holy ghost
[12:52] was
[12:53] we didn't understand that there was a
[12:55] seed
[12:57] already in you you you could not hear
[13:00] the message
[13:00] unless there was a dev a predestinated
[13:03] seed
[13:04] already in you and when that light
[13:07] shine on that seed hallelujah
[13:10] what was the seed to grow up into
[13:14] christ god it was god's seed
[13:18] that he sold in us before the foundation
[13:21] of the world
[13:23] it did listen nothing once the light
[13:26] strikes the seed
[13:27] nothing can stop it from growing and
[13:29] producing
[13:32] nothing oh i loved it
[13:35] the the way the we were trapped
[13:39] i like that i i think brother for the uh
[13:42] lamb brought that word out trapped we
[13:45] were trapped in darkness
[13:48] trapped under circumstances hallelujah
[13:51] but when the light struck us what are
[13:54] you talking about
[13:56] that woman at the well was trapped
[14:00] there's no way she didn't see her way
[14:01] out how could she
[14:03] the world hated her her own people
[14:06] despised her
[14:07] she had to literally go to the well at a
[14:10] time when nobody else would show up
[14:12] hallelujah but then came jesus what was
[14:16] it
[14:16] it was that seal it was that seventh
[14:19] seal it was christ
[14:20] it was god and all of the jews didn't
[14:23] even
[14:24] know he was there his coming even then
[14:27] was a secret amen
[14:30] hallelujah and when he did things
[14:32] supernatural
[14:33] he told them go don't tell nobody amen
[14:37] hallelujah but look who he reveals
[14:40] himself to
[14:44] woman at the well discerns
[14:48] in her life and go tell her
[14:51] go get your husband right now she says
[14:55] i don't have any now that's proper
[14:59] he says yes you do and the one that you
[15:02] have
[15:02] is not your own y'all understand what
[15:04] i'm saying
[15:05] she was trapped by circumstances but her
[15:09] true husband
[15:10] who was the word the quickening power of
[15:14] the word
[15:15] quicken the seed in her
[15:18] now she has a new husband amen
[15:21] and this new husband is the seventh who
[15:24] is jesus christ himself
[15:26] and if he was the seventh then he's the
[15:28] seventh
[15:29] now hallelujah see
[15:32] that's why there cannot be another
[15:34] organization
[15:35] or denomination after this seven is
[15:38] completion
[15:40] hallelujah so who are we married to
[15:43] we're not married to denominations
[15:45] we've been called out of it is that
[15:48] right
[15:48] so if we've been called out of it then
[15:50] where are you
[16:02] in the message recognizing your day in
[16:04] this message
[16:05] brother branham says that the seventh
[16:08] age
[16:10] is finished it's ceased
[16:14] it's dead you say well what do you mean
[16:18] time shall be no more you got to
[16:21] understand where you
[16:22] are people say it ain't over yes it is
[16:26] whether you believe it or not it's over
[16:28] for me
[16:30] uh i got a quote if that's what you need
[16:33] to see
[16:34] but my point is how can you be married
[16:37] to christ
[16:38] and you're in the seventh church age
[16:42] you can't be see you gotta come out of
[16:46] her
[16:47] you gotta die without the camp
[16:50] you got to be crucified with christ
[16:53] outside of the system
[16:55] you can't be in the system the system
[16:58] can never give you a word of
[17:00] resurrection
[17:03] all they can ever give you is the do's
[17:04] and don'ts
[17:06] and we're beyond that you say what do
[17:10] you mean
[17:10] the bible says even paul says who shall
[17:13] lay any charge to god's elect
[17:16] who's going to condemn you who's going
[17:18] to judge you
[17:21] nobody can judge you not the true bride
[17:24] of christ
[17:26] because the bible i mean we know by
[17:28] god's grace when god
[17:29] justifies you is as though you never sin
[17:33] in the first place now we make mistakes
[17:36] people
[17:37] but we make it right hallelujah
[17:40] and god got us covered hallelujah and i
[17:44] still believe
[17:45] that we need to scrub every day wash in
[17:48] the word every day
[17:50] that's what makes you bride because you
[17:53] want to make sure your garment is pure
[17:55] you want to make sure your garment is
[17:56] clean
[17:58] at least on your side on god's side
[18:02] is already done amen
[18:05] neither is beyond the sea but he says
[18:08] but the word
[18:09] is very nighty in
[18:12] thy mouth and we have been
[18:15] taught we have been taught
[18:19] that whatever we confess will come to
[18:22] pass
[18:25] if you confess negative stuff that
[18:28] atmosphere is going to consume you
[18:31] if you connect confess positive stuff
[18:34] why because your words are creative
[18:38] that's why the bible says bless and
[18:40] curse not
[18:42] because you have the ability to do them
[18:44] both
[18:46] amen hallelujah oh is that right
[18:50] oh come on when the sons of thunder says
[18:52] lord let it rain down fire
[18:59] jesus said you don't even know what
[19:00] spirit you are of
[19:02] hallelujah because when elijah did that
[19:04] in the old testament
[19:06] he was an angry prophet
[19:09] it was not the holy spirit that caused
[19:11] him to do that but because he was a
[19:12] prophet
[19:13] god had to honor it
[19:16] and because you're a son and daughter of
[19:18] god god will honor it
[19:21] be careful how you say things now you
[19:23] say what brother looks where are you
[19:24] going with this because
[19:25] you must understand that the whole bible
[19:29] has one purpose and that's revealed
[19:32] christ
[19:35] that's why brother branham talks about
[19:36] moses elijah and john
[19:38] and moses and elijah and joshua and all
[19:41] the old testament
[19:42] he said that was christ amen
[19:46] hidden behind human flesh but it was
[19:49] christ
[19:51] and he says every after he said every
[19:54] every type every christian type every
[19:57] type
[19:58] in this bible is a revelation of the
[20:01] mystery of god
[20:04] we read about esther we see esther
[20:08] we can identify with esther but don't
[20:11] you understand
[20:12] that the coming of esther was the coming
[20:15] of the bride of christ
[20:18] it was god in christ a female in form
[20:22] and you and i must understand it was
[20:24] ruth and all of them the same thing
[20:27] what was it god hiding himself behind
[20:30] the scripture
[20:32] those people didn't know what they were
[20:33] doing
[20:36] but god laid it out in there so that you
[20:39] and i could one day look back
[20:41] and say lord that's me
[20:49] genesis 2 17
[20:52] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[20:53] and evil
[20:55] thou shall not eat of it for in the day
[20:58] that thou eateth thereof
[21:00] thou shall surely die now you understand
[21:04] in that day there were two trees there
[21:06] was a tree of life
[21:08] and the tree of of the knowledge of good
[21:10] and evil
[21:12] let's see what brother brethren says
[21:14] amen
[21:20] he said
[21:25] he said christ that tree that was in the
[21:28] garden of eden
[21:30] there were two trees in the garden of
[21:32] eden
[21:33] these two trees were set there for
[21:36] birth purpose
[21:40] you understand me so what happened with
[21:42] eve
[21:43] was not a mistake
[21:48] they were there for the purpose of birth
[21:52] god amen being a god of contrast
[21:55] he needed the negative
[21:59] so that he can produce the positive
[22:02] there had to be a serpent they had to
[22:06] have that relationship
[22:07] there had to be a cane and there had to
[22:10] be an able
[22:12] because that's what those trees were set
[22:14] there for
[22:18] and he said when eve she was touched
[22:21] and christ was the tree of life
[22:25] now by the woman comes death by the man
[22:28] comes life and everybody know that's
[22:32] that's real it's true whether you like
[22:34] it or not
[22:37] every man born of a woman is going to
[22:39] die
[22:40] that's what i try to tell people i said
[22:42] you know what we spent so many times
[22:44] looking in the real view mirror
[22:46] what you used to be will never be again
[22:49] until you get over there
[22:52] right no matter what kind of pills and
[22:55] what kind of stuff they tried to produce
[22:58] you are who you are
[22:59] oh but i got something good tonight i
[23:01] trust i can say it
[23:02] and i will
[23:06] see we must understand what god is doing
[23:08] with us and
[23:09] and like i said it it puts you in a
[23:11] different frame of mind
[23:14] when when this thing don't is no longer
[23:16] this
[23:18] process creating your mind but
[23:21] it's a life in your heart because a lot
[23:24] of people
[23:25] got every quote down in the message you
[23:27] you quoted they're quoting for
[23:28] but that means nothing paul said you can
[23:31] understand
[23:32] all mysteries and have not that charity
[23:35] in your heart
[23:36] what good is going to do you now i want
[23:38] to say something oh i can't jump right
[23:40] now but
[23:40] my point is this is later than we think
[23:44] we're right on the we're on the end of
[23:46] this thing on the edge of this thing
[23:49] the lord is getting ready to make a
[23:51] transformation
[23:53] we're getting ready to change dimension
[23:55] we're going to catch him
[23:56] up soon soon
[24:00] much sooner than we think
[24:04] that's the vision of the seventh seal
[24:07] we didn't understand it i don't i can
[24:11] remember
[24:12] in my little span of the message we've
[24:14] always we've been trying to figure out
[24:15] what that half hour
[24:17] of silence was and and it's done come
[24:19] and gone
[24:22] we didn't even know it but i got a quote
[24:24] just hold on it's coming
[24:26] because i want you to understand that's
[24:28] the way it always is
[24:30] and the devil can't catch it because he
[24:32] still don't know what it is
[24:34] hallelujah but the bride of jesus christ
[24:38] has been hand-picked and selected
[24:41] to take a rapture and guess what
[24:44] is given to her to know the mysteries
[24:47] you don't have to worry about it coming
[24:50] it's coming
[24:51] remember even when peter had denied
[24:54] jesus christ
[24:56] and when jesus christ was getting ready
[24:58] to to to to
[24:59] unveiled himself to his 12 11 disciples
[25:03] he said wherever peter is y'all make
[25:05] sure he's
[25:06] among this group right
[25:09] i mean that was peter was elected he was
[25:12] chosen and jesus christ had appeared to
[25:15] different ones
[25:16] appeared to them on the on the road to
[25:18] emmaus and the bible said he began
[25:20] with the prophets and began to teach uh
[25:22] uh
[25:23] uh the disciples of christ and and what
[25:25] was he talking about he said all you
[25:27] fools and slowing heart don't you
[25:29] believe everything the scriptures have
[25:31] said
[25:32] now how are you going to know everything
[25:34] the scriptures have said if you're not
[25:36] studying
[25:37] if you don't read it you don't know but
[25:40] he started with moses and he brought him
[25:42] all the way up to the death of christ
[25:44] showing them that this thing was
[25:46] supposed to happen
[25:48] and all they could say oh but didn't our
[25:50] heart burn their eyes still wasn't open
[25:53] you know when they opened he opened his
[25:55] eyes when they got alone
[25:58] in that little old hut whatever it was
[26:00] that little old end
[26:02] and he began to have communion with him
[26:06] and then all of a sudden he broke the
[26:08] bridge you see what i'm saying
[26:11] because the word of god when you hear it
[26:12] preach make you feel good
[26:14] or fuzzy in your heart that don't mean
[26:16] you see
[26:18] it means that you've been in the
[26:19] presence of the lord
[26:21] hallelujah but when the word is broken
[26:24] to you
[26:25] it brings about a stimulation you say it
[26:28] didn't yes it did
[26:30] when those when they began when they saw
[26:32] that that was jesus christ
[26:33] they left and went all the way back
[26:37] to jerusalem listen didn't matter how
[26:39] tired they was they were they were
[26:41] stimulated
[26:45] yes sir in the midst message christ is
[26:47] the mystery of god revealed he says see
[26:49] god has this all to himself
[26:53] it's a secret and that's the reason
[26:56] there was silence in heaven for
[26:58] a space of a half hour and seven
[27:00] thunders uttered
[27:02] their voices and john was forbidden to
[27:04] write it
[27:05] see the coming of the lord
[27:11] that's one thing he hasn't revealed
[27:14] yet of how he would come
[27:18] and when he would come it's a good thing
[27:21] that he
[27:22] doesn't no now it sounds like it wasn't
[27:25] revealed but you got to understand how
[27:28] brother adam talks
[27:30] it's a mystery it's a parable he said it
[27:32] didn't come
[27:33] and then he said the coming of the lord
[27:36] see now i'm going to take you to
[27:38] somewhere else
[27:40] see he was showed or revealed it in
[27:44] every type now brother says now he's
[27:47] showing it in
[27:48] every type
[27:53] he has showed and revealed it in every
[27:55] type that's in the bible
[27:57] therefore the entire bible is the
[28:00] revelation of god
[28:01] mystery in christ the entire bible
[28:05] is an expression of one goal and that
[28:08] goal
[28:09] that god had one purpose he wanted to
[28:11] achieve in the entire bible
[28:14] and all the acts of the of the believer
[28:17] in the bible
[28:18] has been in type and expression
[28:22] what god's great goal is and now
[28:25] in the last days he has revealed it and
[28:28] showed it
[28:29] now if eve had not done what she did and
[28:32] adam followed with her
[28:33] that goal would have been met because
[28:36] you remember
[28:37] amen there was something that god wanted
[28:39] to get out of him
[28:41] and the only way he can get it out was
[28:43] to show in type what he was trying to do
[28:46] now he told adam and eve to do what
[28:49] multiply
[28:50] replenish the earth with what sons and
[28:53] daughters of god of course her name was
[28:55] not eve then
[28:56] it was adam and her fallen name
[28:59] was eve right
[29:02] see you listen let me tell y'all
[29:04] something we can sympathize with all of
[29:06] the dominations all you want to
[29:09] let me tell you like this it's not your
[29:11] plan
[29:14] and who did god have to cancel with
[29:19] there was no counseling who going to
[29:21] tell god what to do oh i think they're
[29:23] good people
[29:24] who can judge the heart but god
[29:27] we don't know but one thing you ought to
[29:30] be glad about
[29:31] is that god has chosen you
[29:38] no there's no one person ever nobody i
[29:40] know not in my enemy if there be one
[29:42] that i would love to see unsaved but can
[29:45] i save them
[29:46] no that's just like brother brandon
[29:48] wanted to heal everybody
[29:50] couldn't do it because he wasn't the
[29:52] healer
[29:55] and the truth of the matter is you and
[29:58] me sound crazy talking like this
[30:01] but it is what it is
[30:05] see therefore the entire bible is the
[30:08] revelation of god mystery in christ
[30:10] the entire bible is an expression of one
[30:13] goal that god had
[30:14] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[30:16] entire bible
[30:18] and that was he wanted to achieve
[30:22] the very thing that he's doing at the
[30:24] end of the day
[30:25] and that is producing a bride
[30:29] how can you have a family without a wife
[30:32] that's why you see the new jerusalem
[30:34] coming down
[30:36] and and the bible calls her what the
[30:38] mother of us all
[30:42] and every stone represents a trial or
[30:45] victory
[30:47] every stone that's why god says when you
[30:50] cross the jordan
[30:51] you pick up 12 stones and put them on
[30:53] that side
[30:54] for a memorial even when it came to the
[30:57] breath
[30:58] breastplate of aaron he had 12 stones
[31:01] and those 12 stones represented the 12
[31:03] tribes of israel
[31:05] but mine knew every one of those tribes
[31:07] were
[31:08] tested by the word
[31:13] they didn't choose themselves god chose
[31:16] them
[31:21] especially one goal that's why i try to
[31:24] tell people i say we gotta stop this
[31:25] murmuring and complaining and god have
[31:28] you know we do too much that's what
[31:30] israel did
[31:32] that's what we do sometimes god
[31:35] what what what's wrong with that
[31:36] scripture
[31:38] the footsteps of the righteous man are
[31:40] ordered by the lord
[31:42] what's wrong with this scripture in all
[31:44] things give thanks
[31:46] amen hallelujah glory to god
[31:51] and we must understand that every trial
[31:53] every test we go through
[31:55] is not for god it's for us
[31:58] there is a reason there is something god
[32:00] is trying to get
[32:02] listen if it's just trying to make us
[32:04] desperate more desperate for him
[32:06] it's there how many of you god has never
[32:09] paid bills for
[32:11] it may have taken time but it came
[32:13] through
[32:20] how many times you make you you ashamed
[32:22] of yourself because
[32:23] you fought with the fact that he's gonna
[32:25] will he do it or will he not do it
[32:29] and it comes through every time we
[32:32] forget he owns
[32:33] everything god can do it
[32:37] what do you think it's the truth
[32:40] i'm learning myself he is still jehovah
[32:44] jireh
[32:45] amen
[32:48] when the devil wants to take your joy
[32:50] because he knows the joy of the lord is
[32:52] your strength
[32:53] but none of us have suffered like job
[32:55] and none of us had suffered like jesus
[33:00] i'm preaching to myself and all the acts
[33:04] of the believer in the bible has been
[33:06] in type an expression that god's great
[33:10] goal what god great goal is and now
[33:13] in the last days he has revealed it and
[33:16] showed it and god help
[33:19] will see it right here this morning
[33:23] what the lord has had in his mind
[33:26] all along and has expressed it
[33:30] what was he what is it he couldn't
[33:33] find a faithful wife
[33:36] until he came to this day
[33:41] y'all better hear what i'm saying and
[33:43] the only way she's
[33:44] faithful because he ordained us too
[33:48] it's not by might not by power
[33:51] but by his spirit said the law
[33:54] hallelujah
[33:56] somebody help me here tonight it's the
[33:58] truth
[33:59] we're talking about the seventh seal you
[34:01] are it
[34:02] amen you're the mystery
[34:06] like odessa amen what's the mystery to
[34:08] that kingdom you're the mystery
[34:11] god had ruth in another country she was
[34:13] a mystery
[34:15] hallelujah and think about those two
[34:18] book esther and ruth the whole
[34:20] bible or the whole redemption plan is is
[34:23] is encompassed by those two or the the
[34:25] encompassed
[34:26] by those two books the mystery
[34:31] they didn't even know who they were
[34:35] is that right but god called
[34:37] circumstances
[34:39] amen political circumstances
[34:43] to take place to bring them to the place
[34:45] they want to be
[34:48] don't look at the squeeze like it's
[34:50] going to destroy you god is going to
[34:52] allow that to happen
[34:53] to bring you to the place where you need
[34:55] to be
[35:00] look at israel how did she get back in
[35:03] the homeland
[35:04] hallelujah god put the screens on them
[35:07] god let political circumstances take
[35:09] place
[35:10] to motivate them and to that power
[35:13] drove them back to their homeland don't
[35:16] you worry
[35:17] god is faithful it's in there
[35:21] it's in there that's why brother ram
[35:22] said that the that the move is
[35:24] on for the bride
[35:30] so is that in prison look what he says
[35:33] the lamb
[35:34] took his book when the seventh seal
[35:37] just ready for it to be open the sixth
[35:41] see the six remember he had the seventh
[35:45] seal
[35:46] he hid the seven seal from us you heard
[35:49] what he said
[35:50] see the seven seal was here here from us
[35:52] because it sounded under the six
[35:56] he wouldn't do it on that one
[36:01] in other words he didn't he didn't do it
[36:02] when they thought see it was hidden
[36:04] he said there is silence in heaven
[36:08] no one knew it was the coming of the
[36:12] lord that's what he said no one knew it
[36:15] it was the coming of the lord
[36:17] not even the prophet he didn't
[36:20] understand it
[36:21] you know why because we had our own
[36:23] understanding on how it was going to
[36:25] happen
[36:26] we did exactly what israel did when
[36:29] jesus came the first time
[36:31] and he had come and gone before they
[36:34] realized
[36:36] it was him you understand me
[36:40] now you say well oh no yes sir because
[36:42] remember
[36:43] it had been prophesied that israel would
[36:46] be have eyes to see
[36:48] and would not see is to hear and not
[36:50] perceive
[36:52] and that's a saint when jesus came and
[36:54] that's the same thing
[36:55] that has happened in this day and
[36:57] laodicea is blind
[36:59] naked and don't even know it she can't
[37:02] see
[37:03] she came here hallelujah
[37:07] and people don't even know that god is
[37:09] not in their churches
[37:12] revelation said he wasn't so who's in
[37:15] there
[37:16] who is that impostor hallelujah can't be
[37:19] the holy ghost
[37:21] it's an impostor somewhere because the
[37:24] holy ghost says amen to
[37:25] every word and when you get a people
[37:28] don't care where they are
[37:30] and they can't say amen to the word and
[37:32] they say oh i got the holy ghost no
[37:34] no no the holy ghost must say amen
[37:37] to his own word that's what brought us
[37:40] out
[37:41] we were able to see the word and we was
[37:44] able to say amen
[37:45] even though we couldn't perform it even
[37:47] though we didn't know how to do it
[37:49] even though we didn't know how it was
[37:50] going to end there was something on the
[37:52] inside that made us believe it
[37:54] and all we could say is hey man what was
[37:57] that
[37:57] that was that predestinated seed on the
[38:00] inside of you
[38:05] the devil hates it
[38:08] you know he hates it you know why he
[38:09] hates it because once the seed is
[38:11] quickened
[38:12] you might as well say it's over that's
[38:15] why he don't want you to really get the
[38:16] holy ghost you know
[38:18] he don't want you to get the holy ghost
[38:19] because he knows once the holy ghost
[38:21] gets in you you see what i'm saying
[38:23] we judge ourselves by our outer court
[38:25] and that's not where god is judging you
[38:28] the flesh has already been judged it is
[38:30] dead amen in the eyes of god hallelujah
[38:33] but it's the inside of the inside that
[38:36] god is judging you by
[38:38] what you allow your soul or your soul
[38:40] allow your spirit
[38:42] uh to do with this flesh
[38:45] but the flesh is judged that's why we're
[38:48] gonna get a new body
[38:50] your body has not been redeemed yet
[39:01] is that right remember in the preview of
[39:03] the bride
[39:04] the bride came by first
[39:08] she would step into the word of god
[39:10] that's that early church
[39:12] you know paul had a good church that
[39:15] early church had the revelation of this
[39:16] message y'all didn't know that
[39:18] because it was the seed and the book was
[39:21] opened
[39:23] hallelujah it was when this
[39:26] antichrist spirit came in is when the
[39:29] book was sealed
[39:30] amen hallelujah
[39:34] seal up the book daniel
[39:37] it was sealed but then when the prophet
[39:40] came
[39:41] something took place the book was open
[39:46] why because the word was restored
[39:51] hallelujah but this time the antichrist
[39:54] will not be able to
[39:56] be a dwarf com to the bride of jesus
[39:59] christ
[40:00] why because we understand his workings
[40:03] we
[40:03] know what he does and we know that if we
[40:06] if he can
[40:07] we allow him to take us off of the word
[40:09] he's got us
[40:10] so we stay behind the word we work with
[40:13] the word
[40:14] we walk with the word we talk with the
[40:16] word we live with the word
[40:18] the word is us and we're the word amen
[40:22] see we know what he
[40:25] is he comes and you know how he did it
[40:27] he in
[40:28] the early age he took the nicolae in the
[40:31] spirit
[40:32] he separated the people making one man
[40:34] greater than the other
[40:36] nobody's greater we all been washed by
[40:39] the blood of the lamb
[40:41] y'all understand me hallelujah there's
[40:44] no
[40:44] great one among us other than the holy
[40:47] spirit
[40:49] so what happened miss america came and
[40:52] oh my
[40:52] brother them said she was the lootest of
[40:54] them all that he was the beginning
[40:56] of the creation of god hallelujah not
[40:59] that god created himself
[41:02] in other words he was the author of it
[41:06] he was the author of the creation he
[41:08] started it off hallelujah glory to
[41:11] god and what is it now god recreating
[41:14] himself again
[41:15] don't you understand you this is
[41:17] blasphemy
[41:19] to the denominational ears but it's
[41:22] truth anyhow
[41:23] they say oh jesus you blaspheme you must
[41:26] have a devil
[41:27] you make yourself equal being that with
[41:30] god being a man you make yourself
[41:32] equal with god oh come on somebody
[41:35] when he said i and my father are one
[41:37] they took up stones to stone him
[41:39] hallelujah
[41:42] what you want to stone me for he said if
[41:44] you don't believe me believe the very
[41:46] works that i do
[41:48] hallelujah because you make your being a
[41:50] man make yourself god
[41:52] but what they didn't understand if they
[41:54] only turned it around
[41:56] you being a man make yourself god no it
[41:58] was god
[41:59] making himself a man see that's what the
[42:02] whole purpose was
[42:03] of it about god condescending into his
[42:06] own creation
[42:08] and making himself a part of his own
[42:10] creation
[42:13] why are you talking about character
[42:16] that's why we need
[42:17] character we can't go to heaven amen
[42:20] with leia to see a character
[42:22] hallelujah we gotta come out of her
[42:25] hallelujah and be cleansed
[42:26] by the blood of the lamb hallelujah is
[42:29] that right
[42:30] you say oh brother books ah yes the
[42:32] bible said this wicked and adulterous
[42:34] generation
[42:35] they always seek it out the signs that's
[42:38] not the bride
[42:39] she don't seek out the signs she don't
[42:42] seek out the miracles
[42:43] because she is the miracle and she is
[42:45] the sign
[42:46] amen
[42:52] i'm gonna tell you something we better
[42:54] let the blood cleanse us
[42:56] hello i i i i you know i see things
[43:00] about myself i don't like every day

[43:18] there's no way to get out once that time
[43:20] come
[43:21] it's finished
[43:25] only those who are under the blood will
[43:28] escape
[43:30] look what he says and i i'm going to cut
[43:32] it short because i i've got a lot of
[43:33] other notes but still
[43:34] listen he says let l in recognizing your
[43:37] day
[43:37] brother brown said let him that filthy
[43:39] be filthy still

[43:45] no i'm going to be holy no no no he says
[43:48] no not will be holy
[43:50] holy now amen let him that's holy
[43:55] not a bob-haired woman she can't be
[43:58] now that sounds very flat but that's
[44:02] that's the scripture the bible says
[44:05] she's dishonor her head
[44:07] and her head is her husband
[44:10] is his husband his head is christ
[44:13] so she dishonors christ how can she be
[44:16] dishonorable
[44:17] and not be filthy
[44:21] see let she that god bob here
[44:24] keep it let he she that wears shorts
[44:29] keep on wearing them let he
[44:32] that denies the word keep on denying it
[44:36] but let him that be holy be holy still
[44:40] see once you're caught it's done and you
[44:43] don't know when that's going to be
[44:47] but i tell you what once the
[44:49] resurrection start
[44:51] you're done if you're not holy
[44:55] you're trapped
[44:58] is that all right because remember now
[45:02] when they start the new saints what
[45:04] what's so beautiful about this
[45:06] that we did not know we didn't know that
[45:08] before the rapture before the real
[45:10] changing of the body
[45:11] we did not know that our loved ones we
[45:14] will resurrect
[45:15] see a lot of us think that once they
[45:17] resurrect we're going to get right no
[45:19] you won't even see them amen
[45:23] only those who are holy
[45:26] and the reason why you will see them is
[45:28] because you in that dimension already
[45:32] you're in a spiritual atmosphere you're
[45:34] not struggling to
[45:35] live right you're there see we've got to
[45:38] understand
[45:39] if the blood saved us the blood can keep
[45:42] us
[45:43] and the bible said that not only that
[45:45] jesus is able
[45:46] to to save us to the uttermost
[45:49] not the almost the uttermost
[45:54] but we got to believe it the problem is
[45:57] we have we lack in prayer
[46:01] prayer is the key to the kingdom i'm
[46:04] telling you
[46:06] you know and you know we we we don't
[46:07] know how to pray most of us we
[46:09] we think a few words to god is all right
[46:11] no no no you got to worship this king
[46:14] you got to honor this king the protocol
[46:16] got to be right
[46:17] you want him to come down god doesn't
[46:19] seen you cry before
[46:21] you understand me but you want him to
[46:23] come down you want the anointing to come
[46:25] down
[46:25] and change you right into his court with
[46:29] thanksgiving
[46:30] into his engagement with praise you've
[46:31] got to enter after you've gone through
[46:34] your
[46:34] your protocol the next thing you do amen
[46:37] you've got to confess and ask god to
[46:39] cleanse you and keep you and all these
[46:40] kind of things
[46:41] and then the next thing you know he's
[46:43] going to take you
[46:44] there amen they ain't just asking him
[46:50] it's traveling where he is like brother
[46:53] say god don't come down to you you go
[46:55] there up to him
[46:57] by way of prayer by way of prayer
[47:02] and if you still on your knees and you
[47:04] still feel like you're earth bound
[47:06] you need to travel a little bit and your
[47:08] prayer should become a little more
[47:11] desperate more sincere and consecrated
[47:16] because god hear everybody talking every
[47:17] day
[47:21] he want to hear something that's real
[47:24] amen
[47:28] you love the lord now
[47:32] i'm saying this because you cannot tell
[47:35] me that this is not true
[47:37] because something's driving us
[47:40] even though we don't see it something's
[47:43] driving us
[47:44] well let me go this way something's
[47:46] driving me because y'all looking at me
[47:47] like
[47:48] y'all what are you talking about but
[47:50] something's driving me
[47:52] something's telling me there's an
[47:53] urgency something even time every time i
[47:56] falter
[47:56] i get scared something moves in me
[47:59] because i know this is not the time
[48:01] to be messing up y'all understand me
[48:04] see so we understand brother ramsay
[48:06] called the jehovah jairo he said but god
[48:08] put seraphims there
[48:11] guarding that tree that no one would
[48:14] touch it
[48:15] now it's got servants uh now is god's
[48:18] servants out
[48:19] trying to drive them into the tree
[48:23] them days they seen the vision they
[48:26] wanted
[48:27] to want it to the tree to get back
[48:30] without an atonement but now after an
[48:32] atonement is made
[48:33] the devil is blinding them turn them
[48:36] this way
[48:36] and and then turn from that uh turn them
[48:39] in this way and then that way
[48:40] from the tree is that right
[48:44] oh people love religion they love their
[48:46] bishop and their preacher
[48:48] listen there's no salvation in me
[48:53] the salvation is jesus christ that comes
[48:56] to the
[48:57] said blood of jesus christ
[49:00] and without the shedding of blood there
[49:02] is no remission of sin that's the word
[49:06] amen we're saying that song come to
[49:08] jesus you got to come to jesus
[49:12] right church is okay but that's not your
[49:15] salvation this is not a
[49:17] a saving station jesus christ is the
[49:20] saving station
[49:23] but when you come on earth what happened
[49:26] the roman power i'm just saying you got
[49:28] to understand there's coming something
[49:30] to push you
[49:32] and this is the part i like and i'll
[49:35] bring it out in just a moment
[49:37] but we see this uh conglomeration of
[49:40] confusion
[49:43] brother branham told us it's in there it
[49:45] would be socialism
[49:47] that's moving the whole thing but behind
[49:51] that is catholicism
[49:54] see but the socialism thing is just a
[49:56] covering
[49:57] y'all better hear what i'm saying and
[50:00] all of this is because we rejected the
[50:02] gospel
[50:04] we took christ out of school right
[50:08] we took him out of politics right now
[50:11] even in the government
[50:12] amen when when when when they don't even
[50:15] mention jesus now you've got psalm
[50:17] that's trying to do so
[50:19] but in the socialism in that era of the
[50:22] of the of of this
[50:23] uh government
[50:26] you're the enemy
[50:30] and guess what it's been ordained
[50:34] to be this way amen oh you think oh
[50:37] they're gonna
[50:38] force these particular vaccines
[50:41] what vaccine it's not a vaccine
[50:47] say what you want to say i've had
[50:49] smallpox
[50:50] i mean chickenpops and mumps and measles
[50:54] and i've been vaccined for all those
[50:56] things
[50:56] once i got vaccine i never caught it
[51:00] you can't be vaccine vaccinated
[51:04] and then catch it again
[51:07] you're inoculated oh come on
[51:11] y'all so scared god what's wrong with
[51:14] you they can't see you they see me
[51:18] you can hardly eat men as loud as you
[51:20] want to
[51:25] y'all understand what i'm saying folks
[51:28] i'm not trying to tell you what to do
[51:30] but if you have to you make sure you
[51:32] pray with it
[51:37] amen because the bible said even if you
[51:38] have to pick up a serpent
[51:40] it shall not harm you don't you walk
[51:43] through the fire the fire can't burn you
[51:45] you walk through the waters he can't
[51:47] drown you if god is with you
[51:50] nothing no weapon formed against you
[51:52] shall prosper
[51:55] nothing amen so if it becomes law letter
[51:58] becomes law
[51:59] you got a greater law and that law is
[52:02] life
[52:05] don't be afraid of anything do i walk
[52:08] through the valleys in the shadows of
[52:10] death
[52:10] i fear no evil for thou art with me
[52:14] ain't no using fear that's what the
[52:16] devil want to put all this fear
[52:18] don't fear nothing whatever comes your
[52:20] way
[52:21] just ask god what to do because you know
[52:23] what he leads you
[52:24] and guides you
[52:29] hallelujah but he's sending a force and
[52:32] this force is to help us
[52:34] right it is to do what what do you know
[52:37] what ain't going to be nice
[52:41] it's not going to be nice because first
[52:43] of all you know
[52:45] it won't be a gathering like this
[52:48] we know it's coming but if you don't
[52:51] know who you are you don't understand
[52:53] that this is you
[52:55] this is for you this is what gonna make
[52:57] you bring you to that place where your
[52:59] faith is going to
[53:01] unite ignite amen and then you'll be
[53:04] changed from mortal to immortality
[53:07] hallelujah this is where god is getting
[53:10] ready to show
[53:11] off if i can see it like that
[53:15] among his bride it's a good thing
[53:18] brother
[53:19] it's a good thing and you and i must
[53:22] understand
[53:23] amen that oh listen brother branham said
[53:26] it like this
[53:28] i feel things that's what make me do
[53:30] what i do
[53:32] when you and i must understand by god's
[53:35] grace
[53:37] that nothing can stop the word of god
[53:41] and brother branham says it is only the
[53:44] denomination the organizations
[53:46] who do not recognize their day and its
[53:48] message
[53:51] you will never see the coming of the
[53:53] lord you'll never understand it and we
[53:55] don't have to understand it
[53:56] we got to believe it
[54:02] when christ came on the earth you know i
[54:04] don't have no special people i like
[54:05] people i love them
[54:07] but and sometimes i feel like i can do
[54:10] things and
[54:11] you know people you don't get the wrong
[54:13] idea about me
[54:14] i love everybody
[54:20] when christ came on earth he was god
[54:23] perfect tree
[54:25] david saw him in the first psalm
[54:28] said tree planted by the river
[54:32] river of water many rivers
[54:35] one water many gifts same spirit
[54:40] huh his leaves shall
[54:43] not wither and leaves represents praise
[54:47] it ain't going to stop
[54:49] but when he come on earth what happened
[54:52] the roman power cut the tree down
[54:56] and hung him on a man-made tree
[55:00] then god raised that tree up and set it
[55:03] at the right hand and sent the spirit
[55:06] back to make a bride for him
[55:10] amen like adam should have
[55:13] had had in the garden of eden hello
[55:16] when that tree tree started off it was a
[55:20] pentecostal
[55:21] tree but like i said sometime we get
[55:25] trapped hallelujah turn with me to
[55:27] revelation 17 and i'm going to
[55:29] close it down here
[55:49] if i preached something wrong you could
[55:51] always come
[55:54] revelation 17 14-17
[56:00] these shall make war with the lamb and
[56:03] the lamb shall overtake
[56:04] come them for he is the lord of lords
[56:07] the king of kings and they that are with
[56:10] him
[56:11] are called the chosen and faithful
[56:14] and he said unto me the waters which
[56:16] thou saweth
[56:18] where the sitteth are people and
[56:21] multitudes and nations and tongues
[56:24] and the ten horns with thou saweth upon
[56:27] the beast
[56:28] these shall hate the and shall
[56:31] make
[56:32] her desolate and naked and shall
[56:35] eat her flesh and burn her with fire
[56:39] y'all understand that that means
[56:42] everybody that's left behind
[56:45] will face the great tribulation brother
[56:48] man said
[56:48] he looked behind him and all he could
[56:52] see
[56:53] from where he stood in america was
[56:56] craters
[56:58] and we're not ignorant god raised up
[57:01] russia forward and no matter how
[57:05] our country think we're the greatest you
[57:08] know i don't see people do that
[57:09] they think they're bad and they pick the
[57:11] fight
[57:12] and get beat up and the thing is
[57:17] all of this is because we did not
[57:20] recognize
[57:22] that our day
[57:26] see if we go on thinking we're in the
[57:28] seventh church age
[57:29] living like that you're going to always
[57:32] be
[57:33] a failure brother bradley said
[57:36] none not any was righteous
[57:40] and holy in that church age it was
[57:43] blackened out bishop
[57:46] pope priest name it pastor
[57:49] deacon nobody was righteous
[57:53] everything was filthy that's the word
[57:57] but he pulled us out like he did that
[58:01] woman at the well he pulled her out
[58:03] she knew something was wrong they said
[58:05] well brother if it's all over
[58:07] if it's already come to a in the seventh
[58:10] church
[58:11] why do you preach it he said because
[58:12] there's still a few in there
[58:17] when i was one of them
[58:25] they come to do what make war that's why
[58:28] i keep telling you
[58:28] everything is going to focus on us but
[58:31] during the time
[58:32] when they come together remember god
[58:35] always make a way of escape
[58:38] when they came amen to to conquer or to
[58:41] get jesus
[58:42] is that right they came to kill him
[58:45] kill everything right and god by an
[58:48] angel come and
[58:50] move them same thing with moses god
[58:53] always make a very escape
[58:55] when it comes to us but realize it was
[58:58] always a political disturbance that was
[59:00] going on
[59:01] that brought the scene that brought the
[59:03] set on the scene
[59:13] you and i must understand a wicked and
[59:16] adulterous generation which we are not
[59:20] and i'm closing but let me read this one
[59:23] more time we read this
[59:25] in closing recognizing your day in this
[59:28] message
[59:29] he said like israel back in her promised
[59:32] land
[59:33] she don't know how she got back there
[59:36] she was automatically put back there why
[59:40] national force put her in her place
[59:44] he says now i'm going to say something
[59:47] national force put
[59:49] israel in her homeland national forest
[59:52] will put the church in the world council
[59:54] of churches but
[59:56] the power of god will put the
[59:59] people in the bride
[1:00:05] while they're bringing their force god
[1:00:07] bringing his power
[1:00:08] see the world forces this way
[1:00:12] and the world forces that way but god
[1:00:15] forces upward the spirit of god which is
[1:00:19] in the world
[1:00:20] which which is the word of god my word
[1:00:24] is spirit and life
[1:00:26] will put the bride in her place
[1:00:29] because she'll recognize the position in
[1:00:32] the word
[1:00:33] then she's in christ will put her in her
[1:00:36] place
[1:00:37] no national force would do it but the
[1:00:40] national force
[1:00:41] did drive israel to the to the homeland
[1:00:44] the national force
[1:00:45] of the council of churches will drive
[1:00:47] every organization into it
[1:00:49] but the power of god will raise the
[1:00:52] bride
[1:00:53] into glory out of it
[1:00:57] so what are you saying do y'all get the
[1:00:59] picture do you see it
[1:01:01] when this power when this forces begin
[1:01:04] to work
[1:01:05] that's you that's when the power of god
[1:01:08] comes
[1:01:09] and delivers us oh i love it it's so
[1:01:12] close
[1:01:15] it's so close and all of this was under
[1:01:17] the seventh seal you said why would you
[1:01:18] say that
[1:01:19] this was it was this was preached in
[1:01:21] 1964.
[1:01:23] after the seals so every message he
[1:01:26] preached
[1:01:26] he was preaching secrets and and giving
[1:01:29] us all kinds of stuff to look at
[1:01:31] and then to go into the old testament
[1:01:32] and everything pull it all out of it
[1:01:35] so you can see who you
[1:01:38] recognizing your day
[1:01:43] it's all about you
[1:01:46] it's all about you now and we could have
[1:01:49] never come to this position in christ
[1:01:52] had it not been for calvary amen
[1:01:55] the blood of jesus christ amen if like i
[1:01:58] said you've heard me say it
[1:01:59] if you stop pleasing preaching calvary
[1:02:01] and the blood of jesus christ like i've
[1:02:03] seen other people do
[1:02:04] oh the bride ain't nothing without it
[1:02:06] that's right the only reason why she
[1:02:08] she is because she was marching to the
[1:02:10] tomb onward christian soldier
[1:02:13] marching as to war with the cross you
[1:02:16] can't get rid of the cross
[1:02:18] with the cross of jesus going on before
[1:02:21] that was her salvation
[1:02:22] that was her hiding place that's what
[1:02:25] made this
[1:02:25] message possible for us
[1:02:30] when you can understand your life is
[1:02:32] under that seal
[1:02:33] it was the thing that was hidden from
[1:02:35] all of uh and right now the devil
[1:02:37] brother talks about how we can come to a
[1:02:39] place where the devil won't even know
[1:02:40] what to do with us
[1:02:41] now you think that's your willpower
[1:02:43] absolutely not
[1:02:45] that's god's power god's power
[1:02:50] let's stand
[1:02:58] you know i i said i preached all of this
[1:03:00] to bring us to a point
[1:03:01] because there are so many people in this
[1:03:03] message who think they can just live any
[1:03:05] kind of way
[1:03:06] i'm saying folks this is a time to make
[1:03:08] sure you're holy
[1:03:09] how are you going to become holy by
[1:03:11] receiving the holy ghost
[1:03:13] that's how you become holy it ain't your
[1:03:15] righteousness it's his righteousness
[1:03:18] and once we see that how badly we need
[1:03:20] the holy ghost
[1:03:21] not tomorrow today now
[1:03:25] we need the holy ghost to fill every
[1:03:26] five of our beings
[1:03:28] we've got to come to a place that is
[1:03:30] nonsense that we i'm talking to me
[1:03:32] we allow the devil to just trip us up
[1:03:34] sometimes so easily
[1:03:36] put up a fight
[1:03:40] show who who you are absolutely bring
[1:03:43] that thing to your mouth
[1:03:46] with authority jesus whipped the devil
[1:03:49] why do you think that why do you think
[1:03:52] that jesus didn't you
[1:03:54] you use his power he used the authority
[1:03:56] of the word see because if you really
[1:03:59] are believing the word
[1:04:00] when you speak it you know it cannot
[1:04:03] come back forward
[1:04:08] god is real to us he's real to me
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:13] and i just don't understand sometimes
[1:04:16] when we fail to see what god is trying
[1:04:19] to do with us
[1:04:26] sometimes i don't think you know
[1:04:30] but i'll leave that alone
[1:04:34] but i'm not here for a show and i'm not
[1:04:36] here to try to find some
[1:04:37] strange doctrine i'm just trying to tell
[1:04:40] you what the prophet said
[1:04:42] and the word and
[1:04:46] i have already determined in my mind and
[1:04:48] my soul what i plan to do and that
[1:04:51] to make a hundred
[1:04:54] not by power not by might but by my
[1:04:57] spirit said the lord
[1:04:59] and that devil tricks us and trips us
[1:05:03] till we think that we can get so busy we
[1:05:06] get too busy we get too busy
[1:05:08] we do too much and it's oh god help me
[1:05:11] he'll help you
[1:05:12] if you're willing to change
[1:05:15] it's got to be your will he's not going
[1:05:18] to
[1:05:18] ravish you or make you do nothing
[1:05:22] whosoever will let him come that's the
[1:05:26] bible
[1:05:31] anybody desire prayer
[1:05:48] foreign
