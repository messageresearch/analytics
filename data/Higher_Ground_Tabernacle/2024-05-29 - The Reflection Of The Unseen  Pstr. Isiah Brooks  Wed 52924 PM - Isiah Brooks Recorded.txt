a beautiful day yes sir a wonderful day amen so we thank God for this lovely day amen amen God is good as we stand let us turn to the scriptures please according to [Music] Hebrews and we're going to read Hebrews the 12th chapter and we'll read the uh 28th verse there and from Hebrews we ask that you turn with to us to ISA isah 54 hallah Hebrews 12 and 28 wherefore receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for God our God is a consuming fire we'll then read from Isaiah 54 amen 15th through the 17th and it reads behold they should surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waters to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper Hallelujah and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord amen let us pray Lord Jesus Savior of our soul King and Prince of Our Lives Lord we thank you Father God for allowing us to be here today call upon your name to symbol in your name father we pray with the reading of the word Lord that you would bless the hearer that we hear with their hearts receive it in their hearts and live thereby increase our faith Lord bring us to the faith of your dear son in Jesus Christ name we pray you may be seated I just been thinking of all of the things that we as Believers have encountered and we know that by the grace of God according to the word and according to prophecy things are not going to get better I I'm not a preacher of gloom and doom but I I do want the people to understand the day that we're living and it cannot be overemphasized if you are anything uh like I am it seem like the more I see and the more I understand the more difficult it becomes even though you're trying to press with all that you have it seems like there is something resisting but I know one thing that God has determined our end and the Bible said he has given us an expected in so I don't know what's happening other than I know that we are fighting demon powers and the word of God gives me such an encouragement to know to know no matter how hard and difficult things become we are partakers of a kingdom uh that cannot be moved my thoughts on what's Happening I I I I entitled this message the reflection of the Unseen because the Bible says we don't wrestle against flesh and blood spiritual wickedness in high places and we know that Satan is the prince of the air that means he have a demon power under his control and what we must understand is that every day the angels of God are battling for us with the Demons of hell even though we can't see it we should all be able to recognize the effect of the victory that the demon I mean that the that the angels are having in our lives there is no way that we could fight what we can't see outside of prayer because when we pray then the angels are charged to bring whatever we have requested to pass Hallelujah and and whether we would like it or not Isaiah said they Shall Gather brother brandham tells us that the battle that we're fighting started a long time ago with the expelling of Lucifer out of heaven and we know that the battle was brought down to earth the Garden of Eden and because of Adam's fall the battle was changed again into the mind of men and that's why brother Brandon preached the message the greatest battle ever fall is in your mind your amen amen so we understand that even when you receive eternal life when you confess the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior you're just entering into the battle Hallelujah and brother Bram tells us that our greatest enemy is ourselves hallelujah amen Adam was commissioned to sub do everything uh that was under his authority and power we know he failed uh because we are now called Sinners and because of his uh uh move toward unbelief we now suffer death pain sickness every attribute of death h on to man hallelujah hallelujah and We Know by the grace of God that in all of this God is still in control hallelujah hallelujah you see we know that this is the garden uh uh Satan's Eden where Satan is the God of this world and a lot of people don't understand uh God permitted him uh to do what he's doing but he's still not in control up to Calvary he was in control amen he caused men to hate each other to kill each other they did whatever they that Satan will inspire them to do Hallelujah but at the calvary God Jesus uh conquered death hell and the [Applause] grave Hallelujah and now this world is being transformed CH by the kingdom of God hallelujah hallelujah yes sir and the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood Amen brother brand is saying I will raise up a standard against it and the prophet of God said God will do it and when all the gates of Torment is pressing against that little church yet it will never prevail will go right on Hallelujah I'm coming from the message here ye him I think of the disciples in the early days when they when they just a little handful of people with all no education no ability Earthly speaking they had no degree they had no denomination behind them they had nothing but one thing and that was the Holy Spirit they had received on the day of Pentecost listen he saids they need it no [Applause] more God had already said upon this inspiration I will build my church I'm going say that again upon the inspiration of the Holy Ghost I will build my church Hallelujah and if there be a church that don't believe in the Holy Ghost it is not the building of Christ Hallelujah because the Holy Ghost himself is a revelation of God in you hallelujah hallelujah and without that Holy Ghost you can't even comprehend what God is trying to do [Applause] or even what he's doing hallelujah hallelujah without the Holy Ghost you'll be a reflector of hell with the Holy Ghost you become a reflector of Heaven Hallelujah is that right that's why Jesus said to the Pharisees when you see me you see because he was a reflection of the invisible God who existed in the invisible worldall in another dimension but now that Dimension can now be seen and understood by The Life of Christ hallelujah hallelujah that's why he says I've been with you all this time and you don't know me when you see me you see the father hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said in Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead body Hallelujah he was made flesh that we might see what the kingdom was all about is that right because remember when pilot said said I I I have the authority over you he said you have none the only Authority you have is that which my father has given to you hallelujah what was Jesus doing he was making pilate know he may be a great king but there's one greater than you there is a greater Kingdom than Rome there is a greater Kingdom than the United States there's a greater Kingdom than Russia there's a greater Kingdom than China and that kingdom is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and God has brought us in this day in this Dimension to reflect the kingdom that they cannot see nor can they understand hallelujah hallelujah he goes on to say in this quot why the ecclesiastical world of that day was well able to shut them out speaking of church that great sinh Court couldn't turn them down could have turned them down and if they've been standing in their own philosophy or in their own theology they would have been smothered out in the beginning but 1900 years has passed and the Gates of Hell still is against it but she's moving on and will for Jesus said it cannot Hallelujah let me put it like that you understand me so I'm coming to something in a moment because when we see all of the things happening in the world in the political realm in the religious realm understand that there are spirits behind that it's demon power hallelujah hallelujah and what they don't understand they are actually working the will of God they they think their their own minds they think that they own their own balls but there is one that is higher Hallelujah and and one thing about the word it cannot fail Hallelujah this is what gets me I can't understand why the world can't believe the Bible when the Bible was written hundreds of years ago and it hasn't missed a beat yet and it will not miss a beat Hallelujah before I was born Revelation was already written Hallelujah before I was born in this Dimension the gospel had already been written Hallelujah and no matter what they cannot stop it they made change the versions of it but the word will never be changed God first wrote it in heaven hall and then he wrote it in the pyramid Hallelujah now he's writing it in the hearts of Hallelujah they can take your Bible they take your church but they can't take Jesus hujjah amen when Jesus anchored in your soul leave you Hallelujah I love it I love you can't burn him out of me you can't drown him out of me choke him out of me whatever you do he's in a place that only he knows where that place is can I say like this in the word of God I have a hiding place hallelujah hallelujah yes sir you know they they the these uh men of old they think they have gotten rid of the seat of God but they don't understand there's another dimension hallelujah it's not far away either Hallelujah is that right brother brandom said it's just a little bit beyond us hallelujah is that right that's the truth and when we die in the flesh we yet live hallelujah hallelujah because there's there's no such thing to True Believer y'all better hear what I'm saying so you don't have to worry about death you don't have to be afraid of that the enemy because the Bible teaches us when the enemy comes in like a f the Lord will lift up a standard I'mma throw my testimony in here my car 3 or 4 days ago started leaking some fluids from the front [Music] and uh when I took it to the the shop they implied that something was tampered with they say they weren't certain but they were saying this can't just happen Hallelujah and they said not only that whoever did your transmission did not do a good job it's leaking so it was a transmiss and this axle thing that's in the front I don't know what where you put the flu well when I went to the shop you know I was I was uh saddened a little bit uhh because I've trusted these people and that's what I said to them I said you know I only come back here because I trust you and I said I've been burnt by this company and that company I named the company I said just give me a call when you find out what's going on I got to go home and get ready for church you know I had to throw him in there to make a long story short they have they have fixed everything and has charged me zero do that's a testimony because I was thinking I said Lord you know I don't want to get a new car but if I got to get a new car you have provided my credit to be good and I get a new car but I don't want a new car but not my will but time be done so it's the will of the Lord for me to keep my car I know it's not Eternal and you know it's just manmade it's got to go down I don't want it to be where it goes down because of neglect you hear what I'm saying now if God is faithful and giving me material things then how much faithful will he be if I ask for Spiritual things you see what I'm saying if we could see that it was the enemy that even attacked my automobile but God gave me Victory I don't know how it really happened and I don't want to accuse anybody but the victory is God gave me G uh uh placed on those people's heart to rep the automobile without charging me anything now you got to know that's a miracle in this day and time that's a miracle cuz I was just telling that same people the company of this car I went to First and they told me it was my alternator and I knew it was my alternator my battery never went down or anything but they charged me $1,500 $1,500 to repair the alterator and they say it's just because of where it's position you understand me so what I'm trying to say is I'm excited am because this kind of thing increases my faith it it somehow elevates me uh to another level Hallelujah now the the world is crooked [Music] and sometime we think we we we want them to act like Saints when they're not amen coming from the message this world is falling apart he was talking about how bad the world is he say now that's not only in America here but that's all over the world whenever you wherever you go the religious world the political world the everything the world of morals it is there is just no more of it it's just morals it's just among the good people and that's very hard to find he it's a shame and the politics and everything is corrupt to the whole thing is sick and putrified Source from the head to the feet the whole world our political system our religious system our moral system everything we've got is G Hallelujah he said just there is no way to keep it together she finished we are at the end of the road that's all there is to it we know we talk about it a long time one of these days it's going to be past talking about it's going to be a historical thing and find and we'll find ourselves outside if we don't watch at this time Hallelujah you got to understand the prophet of God told us over 200 million demons was loosed out of the river Euphrates Hallelujah Now history is caught up with the prophecy's river is D dried up Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying so now we see that this whole world is being inspired by demon for forces Hallelujah it ain't just Russia it's demons behind Russia it ain't just China demon power behind me it's not just North Korea demon behind North Korea America demon poers behind America hallelujah hallelujah and where are they bringing this world they bringing this world into the wall of Armageddon Hallelujah glory to God you better wake up and recognize you are in you are in the midst of a war zone against God hallelujah it's always been religious glory to God but now we see that the bride is the only one that has a real stand Hallelujah God she sees and she understands she knows the storm is coming Hallelujah but thank be to God we had a prophet told us the storm was coming will be great but he said we would crush every one of them hallelujah what was he doing he was taking the Unseen and bringing it to the scene Hallelujah when he went behind the curtain of time not one person was missing Hallelujah everybody that was supposed to be in the bride was there there the bodies huah he didn't know them out but one they were sure they were there because they rested upon his ministry now we see the devil is getting ready turn another page the focus now is on Israel all nations are going to fight us all nations going to come against us you mean America will too she has no choice the Bible says all the Gentile Nations Hallelujah wherever they may be will come against Israel better wake up and smell the cof because we now see that God is building Zion y think she's getting weaker she's not getting weaker like trials and tribulations brings out the best in the bride trial and tribulations brings out the best in Israel just a way God has designed Hallelujah but the Bible say don't you fear hallelujah hallelujah Little Flock it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom hallelujah hallelujah is that all right we understand we're moving to a Channel Hallelujah where God is going to turn to the Jews and when he finally turn to the Jews Gentile day is over hallelujah hallelujah this is a time to press into it this is a time to push this is a time to use your energy to make that the blood is being appli hallelujah hallelujah turn with me to Daniel 12 Daniel hallelujah hallelujah it's real let's go to Daniel 10 first we'll start reading the 10th verse there and behold and hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me oh Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee stand upright For unto thee am I now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling Hallelujah then said he unto me fear not Daniel for the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand and to chasen thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words because of Thy word that's what he's saying I heard your prayer and I come but the prince of the King of Persia me and 20 days y'all understand me in the Unseen his prayer was heard but in the Unseen the Prince of Persia fought with Michael there was a battle going on Daniel didn't know about it Hallelujah don't understand the word of God said that's what you will and it shall be given so when you ask God prayer now the Battle Is it because demons wants to stop the prayer Hallelujah but let me tell you right now when you go down and sship prayer God hears it right there hallelujah what you need do is learn how to wait on God how to wait for God hallelujah know that God hears your prayer you you say brother I'm not worthy you'll never be worthy but my life is hi in Christ your life is hi in Christ and the blood of Jesus Christ covers you protects you Hallelujah and when you speak God hears your Voice through the blood amen amen amen yes God hears you y'all believe that the Bible said to hear your thoughts way before you speak Hallelujah he knows and I love that about him but the prince of the King of Persia with stood me for 20 days 20 one in 20 days but Lo Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remain there with the king of pers now I am come to make thee understand what shall be the fall of the people where in the latter days for yet the is for many days what was he saying God done already if there be a time traveler he's the one and he's listen Daniel in the last days you going to be in your grave when it happen Hallelujah but nothing will stop it I'm going show you what's going to happen in the latter days hallelujah yall understand me find out in the latter days it was Michael who stood up Hallelujah and fought for the Jews Hallelujah God y'all to hear what I'm saying see you got to realize that in the in the Book of Revelation that woman that had the 12 stars that was Israel hallelujah hallelujah and she had a baby which was Jesus hallelujah hallelujah and that could be typed even with the bride but we know by the grace of God that it was Israel that produced the word hallelujah hallelujah and where did Jesus have to flee in the wilderness hallelujah hallelujah oh my but she was caught up Hallelujah she was caught up when the persecution came you said me brother brother that 144,000 those ones who was killed excuse me those ones that was killed Amen on the Hitler stying and musolini where are they now under the altar of God hallelujah it wasn't you know Daniel said that's what's going to happen and it ain't all over yet hallelujah hallelujah and you know what God does when he raise up a king to to chastise Israel God being a just God come right back around and destroy the king that chasti Israel that's what he did he he raised up pharaoh to to persecute them is that right and then when Pharaoh's job was over Hallelujah God didn't destroy Pharaoh that's the way God does it hallelujah hallelujah read Jeremiah everybody that was raised up against Israel Hallelujah God cut them down at now if God did that for Israel what about his rde Hallelujah no weapon formed Prosper is that right Jesus said be careful you treat my little ones if you offend them it's better for you to tie a millstone about your neck and cast yourself into the sea hallelujah hallelujah is that right that's how God works on our behalf I've seen him do it haven't you seen him do it when somebody mistreat you or do harm to you the next thing you know something bad is happening to and you didn't even ask for it that's right that's the truth I remember this man this false Man of Mine he got all in my face cursing me literally a month later maybe two months later how the the time he fell off his his horse Hallelujah never could go back to work for what I understand he died and I was so grieved because I failed to pray for the man now that same man was good to me that same man was good to me he gave me the biggest raise of my life that's right in his business I was to buy my first home and I was able to buy my first new car and yet in still he come right back around I thought he was going to punch me but you don't feend you don't offend the little ones that that's that's the word hallelujah that that ain't just for the preacher that's for you touch not my anointing you know a lot of people in the church are sick and afflicted because of the way they treat each other you ain't no better Christian than I am and I'm no better Christian than you you can't offend me and I can't offend you now if the word offend you that's that's between you and God you love the Lord amen let me read a little more here let's just read it Romans 11th chapter ROM the 25th and the 26th verse hallelujah hallelujah he says now listen at Paul here Paul said if anyone else even an angel preach any other gospel what he has to be cursed watch I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this L you should be wise in your own conceit he said there you are blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fulfilling the fullness of the Gentiles be com in the last Gentile bride he brought brought in for the bride the blindness come to Israel for that purpose and what bride member knowing this will not pray for Israel and stand for her oh they might hurt me what Hallelujah now thank about it God so loved Israel he put them in position for the crucifixion and before he died he said father forgive them for they know not what they do hallelujah hallelujah he loved them then and he will ever love forever he said with the Everlasting Love I have drawn thee think about it they had to suffer to get back to Israel hallelujah hallelujah but the prophecy said they would come back on wings of an e now I'm preaching all of this so you could understand there were demonic power working behind the scen Hallelujah it wasn't just a man called Hitler it was demon power perhaps the same power ofers you understand me I'm just saying they're demons and brother Bram said every country has their demon and they are territorial Hallelujah they can't get alone they fight behind the scen Hallelujah so why do you think they going to like you because every time they see you they see the man who defeated him Hallelujah surely if they hated Jesus they going to hate you hallelujah hallelujah that's true hallelujah hallelujah so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come of Zion a deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness for J for Jacob so what am I trying to tell you there are demons that wants to see you destroyed they can't do it not because you're strong because he's strong hallelujah hallelujah I mean he even told the devil when it came to job touch not my ano Hallelujah you can make him sick you can make him do whatever you want to but the gift that I've given him that eternal life don't bother that hall hallelujah It's Shouting Time in Heaven I'm telling you Hallelujah see right now they are Israel yeah I'm jumping now the see God purpose to Blind them y'all know that without blinding them we could not be grafted in Hallelujah and God also said he was going to turn Israel around Hallelujah he's going to take away the ungodliness from Jacob hallelu see what what we don't see and what we don't understand Revival is not always the way it appears Hallelujah if you take the Revival of a ocean or sea it looks like everything's fighting it is chaos but what it is God is shaking it to get all of the dirt out of it you understand me all of the trash this is why that squeeze coming it's to get all the trash out of your life seemingly you can't get it out but God will send the storm you going to get it out you say I can't pray all night you will when that comes and we're not far from it hallelujah we're not far from it oh you ain't praying now but you will pray then you say I don't know about that well let me say it like this it started out this way when Peter was thrown in jail it shook the church what happened to them the Bible say they got to praying they prayed all night all night then Jesus came Hallelujah and Jesus came in a way that wasn't expecting him Hallelujah he shook that jail Peter walked out they didn't even know it was Peter they were their friend and they some of them thought Peter was already dead Hallelujah who's knocking at the door is Peter it must be a spook it must be his ghost why cuz nobody could escape the Roman jail but they failed to see God got the key to every door understand hallelujah hallelujah so I want to say it like this if you feel like you are entrapped with any kind of devil God got the key he can unlock whatever your troubles are and he can set you free Hallelujah why because he has given you dominion over the Devils that entraps you is that right because the Bible says with every uh with every Temptation God has already made a way of Escape take your way of Escape huah and right let me move on right now they are Israel that's under the altar what Israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved you believe that now be He Who blinded them God God blinded his own children no wonder Jesus standing at the cross and them Jews howling for his blood that was his own kids and he was he was the scripture he was himself the word and there he's knowing that those people would have gladly received him can you imagine he knew he knew then that Israel would have gladly received him purposely blinded them Hallelujah that they wouldn't receive it see the scripture says they would do it and he blinded was blinded Jesus ped them even so much as he said father forgive them for they don't know what they doing see they were blind Paul said they were blind For A Cause notice I want you to watch this real close they were given robes they didn't have they were given robes white robes each one of them now the Saints now have already have one they get it here but there they was given robes y'all hear me he said you get your white robe here hallelujah clothe me oh God CL me in the world of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the Saints already have theirs and gone on Hallelujah so realize when this happen the Saints are already gone they see they had had a chance because they were blind by God they didn't have a chance their own father so that the grace of God could be fulfilled so the bride could be took from the Gentiles is that right Hallelujah and y'all know the story when Israel was getting ready to bless Joseph and his son Hallelujah he crossed his hands and brother Bram said that's when God moved away from the Orthodox Church hallelujah amen and chose him a gentile bride hallelujah thank God for the cross but even as Joseph crossed his hand Jesus Christ had to suffer the cross in order for you and I to be saved Hallelujah is that right I'm almost done now Satan is he the stage is being set understand you you know you well I got to see this and I got to see that when you start seeing normally it's too late must have faith to know that God is working behind the scenesall I I don't know about you but there's no reason why I want to stay here no no fine house no fine car no great career that's trash when it comes to compar comparing Lord Lord do ask me the question well you want to stay here and just move your lawn no at whatever time you want to take me I'm ready you said how you know you're ready because the blood has been applied hallelujah hallelujah when you got the token you don't have to worry about nothing hallelujah hallelujah listen what he says in the invasion of the United States he's in my coming to the this platform like everything else but Christians living like everything else across the country then they call it religion it's a religion but it's a long way from the salvation of the Lord that's right they just got the people toj to adjust a big church work up then as soon as a little work up goes goes over then the first thing you know you can't find one of them the church is setting empty brother if a man love God he feel his seat in the church every time he can't stay away from it that's right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's those are not my words Hallelujah that's God speaking to the man hallelujah hallelujah is that all right God is good to us hallelujah hallelujah one more scripture I've got more than one but I'll just go to Revelation 9 we look at what Israel going through and that same these all of these events yeah are uniting all of these Gentiles all these Gentile nations against Israel Israel defends herself and they want to wipe her off the map when China don't kill Millions Russia has killed millions of their own yall better hear what I'm saying I mean America don't have Clean Hands either but this little piece of land because it's God's land it is what Satan wants that's right amen but he'll never have it Satan wants you but he'll never have you thank you Lord is that right God is real when God planted that seed in you before the foundation he knew exactly what he was doing hallelujah hallelujah you know they have those little VI devices that when you can pick up gold if it's deep in the ground or deep in the soil been lost by somebody what do you call that metal detector where God has a seed detector he don't care where you're at he knows how to find you yes he knows how to find you Hallelujah the scripture says and they had a king over them Revelation 911 and they had a king over them which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in Hebrew tongue is is AB but in the Greek tongue has his name apolon y'all know who that is that's nobody but the Beast nobody but the devil hallelujah hallelujah and so you got to understand the king is the king of this day and time Hallelujah is that right he the devil is the ruler why do you see these people especially in Hollywood outright worshiping the devil they're not ashamed of it anymore they don't mind being called the children of the devil hallelujah oh yes they blaspheming the name of Jesus and everything hallelujah hallelujah it is a sign that Satan has gther his people together and is gathering Hallelujah and know this if they are being gathered the Bride of Jesus Christ is being gathered too and the Bible said that they will be gathered for the armagedon war hallelujah hallelujah it's it's right on us hallelujah hallelujah why they going going through all that distress being burnt and everything else earthquakes you know I heard brother brandom say yesterday he said the world is it's in that message world is falling apart he said they they uh it's out of cadence because of all of the bombs that they're exploding the weather everything else got the world going the way it's going calling it global warming do you know they will explode an atomic bomb in the ocean crazy they've been doing that and they wonder why all these fish comes up dead and burnt burnt scored and they said wonder what happened see that's what they do they throw the stone and hide their hands but the scientists is the reason why we had the [Music] anian they did it and they doing it again hallelujah hallelujah like brother said they're tampering into God's laboratory Hallelujah and they're going to make a germ that that they have no control of Hallelujah is that right because y'all know the movies have you ever seen the horror movies have you ever seen one it's always the scientist that be killed by the monster he created that's way it works and that's how it's going to be in this world the very thing they create is the very thing that's going to kill them amen amen let me move I'm I'mma go ahead on uh by the grace of God you love the Lord Revelation 174 and then I'm I'm going to just a little more and then let you go it says the shall make war with the lamb com and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords king of kings and they that are with him are called The Chosen and faithful I love that they that are with him are called Chosen and faithful hallelujah hallelujah is he going to make no the Bible say this Antichrist this Beast is going to make war with the lamb it is what it is they're going to come after this bride and at the time they come for us God will take us is that the truth that's the truth they will be killing a lot of church folks but it'll be the remnant hallelujah it's like ra Rachel cry for her children when they went when they went for Jesus they didn't get Jesus but they got all of the other first you understand me in Egypt they went for Moses they didn't get Moses but they got all the other children hallelujah hallelujah and that's the way it's going to be again they come for us but God will give us Grace by the revelation of the rapture be changed Hallelujah huj they won't even know we're gone ain't God good yes he is see the stage is set is for the completion of Malachi 4 the completion of Malachi 4 where the Bible tells us that the Earth will be burned it didn't happen in John's day but it happen in this day hallelujah hallelujah you know John couldn't leave until Jesus was first identified brother Bram couldn't leave until Jesus was identified hallelujah hallelujah and this message is the blooded bleeding body word of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am Hallelujah there was more I want to say but I'm going to stop here we know how the Judgment has come West Coast and the prophecy said capernium capernium you would not he goes on to say Los Angeles Los city of the angels and what what was all of this about God the most you can't speak evil of God or his people and I'm coming to a point you see what America is doing against Israel that's the program because if you curse Israel you will be cursed if you bless Israel you will be blessed so God is allowing America to turn her back and curse Israel and then it gives him the right to curse I forgot the man's name that was over Iran the one that just got killed race or something like that something like that but anyway he was the one I I just learned this today but he was the one that that made those other countries bomb Israel and scripturally God had already spoken that this man would die too see you can't curse Israel without being cursed and we've done things as a country to Israel and then God comes right back and do it here on our soil it is what it is hallelujah when we made Israel give up territory Hurricane Katrina came in here and we had to give up to and grave sites Graves coffins was floating down the river down the road I'm so thankful I wasn't there just so you know oh my God see it ain't about Israel uh America only this is the whole world now amen all of them and they hate you don't even think you're going to have it easy no it's coming but God said no weapon formed against you shall don't ever forget when somebody mistreat you there's a demon behind the scene that's making them do whatever they doing they might have to pay for for being obedient to it but the Bible you must stay keeping in your mind we do not wrestle against flesh and blood this is a spiritual warfare and these Devils will make people mistreat you say things to that they shouldn't I had somebody do something to me today and I just looked and I looked and then the Lord just gave me peace he don't even know what he's doing you see and I could have gotten very angry I could have opened my mouth and said something but the Lord would not allow me to instead he gave me wisdom this man don't even know what he's doing make excuses for the Sinners people make excuses for the S and then make the Saints know what they're doing you love the Lord let's stand let us be a reflection of the Unseen there's so much more I've had in notes but I I sometimes jot down too many things but I want you to see that nothing is out of cadence everything is moving by the power of God the positive and the negative hallelujah hallelujah and all of these people here in America think well I'm going vote this one in and this one is going to be president the only person that's going to be president is the one that God has already ordained and it ain't about your vote it's about the will of God and whatever that will is we going to thank God for it because it'll be serving his purpose no enemies you got to love all your enemies you might not like a person ways you still got to love you love the Lord let us pray father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your
